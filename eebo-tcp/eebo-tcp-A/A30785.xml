         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen once we exactly ponder in the Scales
of our underſtanding that thrice preſſing
load of Jewiſh ingratitude, diſobedience,
and obſtinacy, for which they were day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
branded by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the reſt of the
Prophets with a foul guilt, to which was annexed a
vehement reprehenſion. When we ſeriouſly conſider
thoſe horrid threats and execrations wherewith God
in his juſtice would depreſs them, unleſs they framed
their lives according to the ſtrict rule of his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements;
this ought to be a warning-piece unto us
to entertain ſuch bleſſings with a more gratefull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,
and hitherto to bend all our ſtudies, that by
our unthankfulneſs we ſhould not make our ſelves
unworthy of them, and ſo be dis-inherited of ſuch a
poſſeſſion. <hi>Moſes</hi> in this manner prophecies of the
Jews ingratitude,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</note> Jeſurun maxed fat, and kicked. (<hi>thou
art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with

eſteemed the worke of his ſalvation.</hi> This iſſued from a
prophetical ſpirit, declaring that as already preſent,
<pb facs="tcp:40423:3"/>
which after the revolution of many a year was to be
fulfilled and accompliſhed. This ingratitude was in
its ſwadling clouts when <hi>Joſhua</hi> led <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the land
of promiſe, which is ratified by the unanimous ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage
of the whole Colledge of Prophets, and almoſt in
the very ſame terms by <hi>Hoſea</hi> in chap. 13. <hi>Jeremy</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns
them as guilty of the ſame crime; the bill of
inditement runs thus:<note place="margin">Jer. 11. 10.</note> 
               <hi>They are turned back to the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
of their fore-fathers which refuſed to hear mywords,
and they went after other gods to ſerve them: the house of</hi>
Iſrael <hi>and the houſe of</hi> Judah <hi>have broken the Covenant
which I made with their Fathers.</hi> And God himſelfe by
the mouth of his Prophet thus proclaims their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy:
<hi>Since the day that your Fathers came out of the Land
of Egypt unto this day,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 7. 25. 26.</note>

the Prophets, dayly riſing up early and ſending them;
yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their eare, but
heardened their neck, they did worſe then their Fathers.</hi>
The obſtinacy of this People at laſt grew to ſo high a
pitch, that they ſtopt their ears at the admonition of
the Prophets, who cried aloud unto them to amend
their waies, and curbed their offences with tart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions,
killing, ſtoning, rewarding every one
with ſome bitter death;<note place="margin">Nehem. 9. 25. 26.</note> which act of theirs is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

they mere diſobedient and rebelled againſt thee, and
caſt thy Law behind their backs, and ſlew thy Prophets which
teſtified againſt them to turn them to thee, and wrought great
provocations.</hi> And <hi>Jeremy</hi> also may be cited for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
for his words are theſe: <hi>Wherefore will ye plead

                  </note> they have received no
corrections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your own ſword hath devoured your Prophets like
a deſtroying Lion.</hi> When the Lord ſees this his people
thus altogether incapable of corection, he afflicts them
with all the puniſhments which <hi>Moſes</hi> by the ſpirit of
God had denounced againſt them, neither their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
nor goods can now eſcape the laſh of his fury; he
ſends among them the ſword, famine and peſtilence,
tempeſts, diſeaſes, imbred diſſention, and diſcord; and
to make their miſery compleat, caſts them out of that
Land flowing with milk and hony, and cauſes them to
trace the captives ſteps into another which they knew
not. The ten tribes together with their King <hi>Hoſhea</hi> is
carried by <hi>Salmanaſſer</hi> into <hi>Aſſyria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Reg. 17.</note>

two remaining Tribes, <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> were not
hurried to repentance by the preſent view of their
brethrens afflictions, God ſends <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> King
of <hi>Babel</hi> againſt them, who leads them captive into the
Land of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> makes <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a deſolate heap, and
turns their Temple, their chief beauty into aſhes. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
the ſpace of 70 years fully expired, theſe 2
tribes were again brought out of the houſe of bondage,
becauſe it was the Almighties pleaſure to preſerve the
tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> even unto that time, when according to
his promiſe, out of that tribe, and in the promiſed land
the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould be incarnate. But for all this theſe 2
tribes did not much outſtrip the other 10 in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of holineſs; for they always following their own
devices, ſeriouſly traced the forbidden by-paths of
their forfathers, for which the later Prophets, <hi>Haggai,
Zachary</hi> and <hi>Malachi</hi> were earneſt declamitants againſt
them: the laſt of which being a Prieſt, &amp; proclaiming
them guilty of a wicked life, threatens them with a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

            <p>My ſecond Motive was this, that the hardened in
heart, and blindfolded Jews at last deſcending into
the Chambers of their ſtrict cogitations, might have
ſome glimpſe of the greatneſs of their infidelity, and ſo
convicted before the face of the whole world of that
more than brutiſh folly in the expounding of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures, and of their old wives tales, whereby
God for the moſt part is blaſphemed, and his ſaving
word againſt all humane reaſon after an execrable
manner perverted, they might begin to be aſhamed,
who with ſuch a whoriſh forehead, and want of wit
did not fear to ſpeak or write in this manner of God
Almighty, and his holy word, and that at length they
might think, that they had ſtumbled at that ſtone of
ſtumbling, and rock of offence laid in <hi>Sion,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
that they ſhall fall proſtrate upon the ground,
be broken, to Gods Law enſnared and captivated,

ſleep,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10, 11.</note> and ſo cloſed their eyes, that every propheſie
and the whole Scripture was to them as the words <hi>of
a book that is ſealed, &amp; that the wiſdome of their wiſe men is
now altogether periſhed, and the underſtanding of their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

God of mercies have mercy upon them, and convert

Gentiles ſhould be equal copartners with them in Gods favour,
and that the Meſſias ſhould in a like meaſure adminiſter to us

the holy Angels and all other creatures with the ſtroke of
death, nay, they would not be afraid of the fact, though a

of it, ſo incomprehenſible and auſtere is the pride mixed with

Such alſo they are who would ſeem to burn with zeal that
the Word of God might be purely propagated, becauſe they
believe in God with an accompliſhed faith, and cleave unto
him with a ſincere and righty ſettled confidence above all the
Nations of the earth, as <hi>Paul</hi> bears witneſſe, <hi>That they have

               <p>1.<note place="margin">The Articles of the Jews creed</note> I believe with a true and perfect faith, that God is the
Creatour, Governour and preſerver of all Creatures, that he

that no corporeal eſſence can be compared unto him.</p>
               <p>4. I believe with a perfect faith, that God the Creatour is

               <p>This is Summe of the thirteen Articles of the Jewiſh Creed,
as they are ſummarily and briefly comprehended and ſet down
in their Books of Common Prayer: in which belief the poore
&amp; blinded ſouls of the Jews after a lamentable manner, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant

groans, much anxiety, inexpreſſible doubting, and
outcries, ſighing out their laſt farewell to the beloved priſon of
their bodies, are utterly loſt and undone. Now that every one
may with greater facility comprehend the very gloſſe and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which the Jews themſelves annex to this their Creed, I
have thought it meet to illuſtrate the Articles thereof by the
lamp of a ſmall Comment. And firſt of all we are to know,
that the faith of the Jews and Moſaicall Religion (according
to their own writings) was built upon theſe Articles, as upon

from thenceforth, throughout all ſucceeding ages, that every
Jew, confeſſing this faith, ſhould reſolve to live and die in the

               <p>The fith Article is, that God, one in Eſſence, is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped,

the Holy Scripture may ſerve us for an inciting School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter.</p>
               <p>The ſixth Article is, that God out of his goodneſſe, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his meere good pleaſure hath elected ſome out of the
whole race of mankind, whoſe mind and underſtanding he
hath purified above others, hath enriched them with the Spirit
of foretelling things to come, and hath ſo ſubjugated their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicacity,
to the will of him their Creator, that they become
his oracles, whereby he ſhews the way unto ſilly mortals, in
which they ought to walk, if they intend to obtain the end of
their faith, the ſalvation of their ſouls.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh Article is, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the moſt ſublime, and
excellent in the whole Catalogue of the Prophets; that he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
unto ſo high a degree of wiſdome, humane perfection,
honour and dignity, that he was accounted equall unto the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;
whereupon the prohecies of this one man did in many
reſpects exceed the Prophecies of others.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, God ſpake unto other Prophets by ſome Angel,
who was a Mediatour between God and them, but with <hi>Moſes

               <p>Secondly, the other Prophets received their Propheſies, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by dreams in the night, or by ſome profound ſleep upon
the day, wherein all their Members, yea their whole Bodies
were ſo ſtupified, that onely their mind and memory did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
their proper operations, but <hi>Moſes</hi> did not receive his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
after this manner, but as it is written of him.</p>
               <p>If there ariſe a Prophet among you, <hi>I</hi> will appear unto him in a

Thirdly, when the ſpirit of Propheſie came upon any other
of the Prophets either in dreams, by viſions, or the miſſion
of an Angel, they had, as it were, a certaine deprivation of
their natural powers and faculties, that being aſtoniſhed, a
horrible dread came upon them, and they driven into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie;
as the Holy Spirit witneſſeth of <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet:<note place="margin">Dan. 10. 7, 8, 9.</note>
                  <hi>I</hi> Daniel <hi>ſaw alone the Viſion: for the men that were with me ſaw
not the Viſion; but a great quaking fell upon them, ſo that they
fled to hide themſelves. Therefore I was left alone, and ſaw this
great Viſion, and there was left no ſtrength in me, for my comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
was turned into corruption, and I retained no ſtrength. Yet
I heard the voyce of his words: And when I heard the voyce of
his words, then was I in a deep ſleep upon my face, and my face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ground.</hi> But <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuffered no invaſion of feare or
anxiety when he received his Propheſies: whereupon the
Scripture ſaith,<note place="margin">Exod. 33. 10.</note> that <hi>the Lord ſpake to</hi> Moſes <hi>face to face, as a
man ſpeaketh to his friend:</hi> even ſo familiarly, that he was not
ſubject to the leaſt amazement,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Other Prophets could not by any proper faculty
prophecy when, and after what manner they would, but only
then, when God did not only command them, but alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
them with gifts and abilitie correſ pondent to ſuch
a function, whereupon it often came to paſſe, that they did
beſeech God to ſend upon them the Spirit of Prophecy, who
for a certain ſeaſon had not ſpoke in this Dialect, yea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
did altogether leave off to Prophecy. And for this
cauſe, according to the practiſe of <hi>Eliſha,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Kings 2. 15.</note> they deſired to heare
the melodious ſound of muſical Inſtruments, whereby their
ſpirits and underſtandings might be recreated; but <hi>Moſes</hi> could
prophecy at his own pleaſure, whenſoever he was conſcious of
a conveniency.<note place="margin">Lev. 16. 2.</note> whereupon it is writen: <hi>Stay you here, that I
may know what the Lord will command you: And the Lord ſpake
with</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaying, &amp;c.</hi> For theſe reaſons was <hi>Moſes</hi> more
worthy then the reſt of the Prophets, yea, in that ſuperemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
manner, that no Prophet was ever compared unto
him.</p>
               <p>The eighth Article is concerning the Law,<note place="margin">Artic. 8.</note> that it was ſo

amongſt, them The manner how it was given, whether by

writing, or dictated of God to <hi>Moſes</hi> by word of mouth, it
is not needful to inquire. If it proceeded from the mouth of
God, then is it neceſſary that every parcel thereof ſhould be

then the overthrow of Chriſtian Religion among the Jewes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to put upon it the badge of falſhood; for making it
hatefull unto them, he might for ever terrifie them from the
imbracing of it.</p>
               <p>Hence the Articles concerning God the Creator, that he is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40423:12"/>
one alone, incorporeal and eternal, hitherto muſter up their
forces, that they condemning the Chriſtian doctrine of the
Trinity, and Chriſts perſon, might make it liable to contempt:
as though that we Chriſtians, by maintaining a Trinity, did alſo
infer a plurality of Gods, or that Chriſt ſhould not be God,
nor partake in his Fathers eſſence, becauſe it was his pleaſure to
aſſume our fleſh in time, not from eternity: whereupon
when hence it follows that he is no God, it may ſerve for a
neceſſary conſequence, that he is not to be worſhipped, for
this is due to God alone, as the fifth Article affirmeth: and
God is only a Searcher of the hearts, and ſo was not Chriſt, as
in the 11. Article. In the ſame manner the 6, 7, 8, 9. Articles
are placed in a diametrical oppoſition to the Doctrine of Chriſt,
and the whole Goſpel, intimating, that Chriſt was no true
Prophet nor Teacher ſent from Heaven, becauſe his Doctrine
was not delivered unto him out of Gods own mouth, as it was
to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that therefore our Saviour ſpake many things
againſt the Law in his ſayings to the People, yea, was not afraid
to alter many parcels thereof, which ought to have remained
unchangeable. Furthermore, if it be true, that man for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
of his life, and tracing the way of Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as alſo for his owne good deeds can merit life eternal;
and on the contrary, for his evil works and ungodlineſs becOms
the Heir of everlaſting torments: in what reſpect, I pray thee,
doth the paſſion and death of Chriſt any whit availe us? The
wheele of time hath not traviſed many minutes, ſince a certaine
Jew did not bluſh to affirm to my face, that he needed not any
to ſatisfie for his ſin; that it is meet, every Fox ſhould give his

               <p>When therefore the hard hearted and hoodwinckt Jews did

the Prophets declare unto us the ſame God, that the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40423:13"/>
propounds, though more darkly, ſhewing, that there
is a Trinity in uniTy, And an unity in Trinity, to wit, God
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, yet the Jews, hot

of heaven and earth, it neceſſarily follows, that they place no
belief in the true God, but rather by a ſtupid ignorance of him
and his Eſſence become the very emblemes of Idolatry.</p>
               <p>In that they affirm, that whatſoever <hi>Moſes,</hi> or any other
of the Prophets commit to writing, was altogether orthodox,
and that their Text is neither to be augmented or diminiſhed:
that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a great and famous Prophet, is an eſtabliſhed
truth, yet we doubt not, but their underſtanding was ſubject
to a monſtrous depravation in this their aſſertion.</p>
               <p>For firſt of all, they do not onely not believe what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets to be true, but alſo do prefer
the Expoſitions of their wiſe men and Rabbines upon the Law,
and other parcels of holy Writ, before <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets;
yea, they eſteem more of the word of a Rabbine than of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi>
furthermore, they account the Traditions, Statues and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
not as additions to the Law, but for the very Law it
ſelf, which <hi>Moſes</hi> received from the mouth of God, and taught
unto others,<note n="a" place="margin">This is the <hi>thorah begnal peh,</hi> above mentioned.</note> yet did not put it in writing, leſt the Gentiles
learning it alſo, might put it in execution; for without this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
<hi>Moſes</hi> his Law can neither be underſtood nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
as we ſhall more at large hereafter manifeſt.</p>
               <p>That they perſwade themſelves, that the Law was given with
this condition, that nothing of it ſhould at any time be changed,
they groſſely miſtake: the Ceremoniall Law ſignified Chriſt to
come, which whenby his incarnation he had fulfilled, ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after the holy Temple muſt kisse the ground, and embrace
the duſt, the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the holy things are utterly
deſtroyed, the Jews baniſhed their own Land, and diſperſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Gentiles, that at laſt they might underſtand the time
already come, wherein there ſhould be but one Shepherd, and
one Sheepfold, and that ſeeing the Gentiles were entered into

Creatour of heaven and earth, that they were alſo made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers

               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:40423:13"/>
Likewiſe their error is inexcuſable, in making <hi>Moſes</hi> the
greateſt Prophet, thence ſtriving to annihilate the worth of our
Saviour, as one who is not worthy to looſe the latchet of his
Shooe, but blaſphemouſly terming him a lying Doctor. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
doth convince, that in this thing many of the Jewes
have the lie caſt in their teeth by their own convicting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
They believe aright, that in <hi>Moſes</hi> and other Prophets
the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was promiſed; but herein their underſtanding is
miſerably perverted, that they yielding to credit that he is

not the leaſt reliſh or ſpark of underſtanding in them: for in
the confirmation and declaration of their faith ſettled upon no
foundation, in the Expoſition of the holy Scripture they ſeema
as ſtrangers and aliens to the word of God, who had dreamed
of it about ſome thouſand years ago, and now grope after it, as
the blind man gropeth the for wall in darkneſs.</p>
               <p>I will not in this place add one word more concerning the
Jewiſh beliefe and ſuperſtition, conſidering that I ſhall ſpeak
more largely of it in the following Chapters, yea, more then
they could wiſh ſhould be revealed. It is now ſeaſonable and
expedient to ſpeak ſomething of the cauſe of their blindneſs and
obſtinacy with which they are plagued, eſpecially in the reading
of the Word of God.</p>
               <p>It is apparent out the Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament,<note place="margin">The cauſes of Jewiſh obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> The Jews always have been ſo ſtiff necked, that if once they fixed
upon any opinion, that no force of Argument could inforce
them to relinquiſh it: whereupon <hi>Moſes</hi> and the reſt of the
Prophets ſo often reprehend them, for which many of them
were perſecuted and put to death by the obſtinate Jews, who
for this very cauſe are often in the new Teſtament termed, the
Murtherers and Butchers of the men of God. When God had
once choſen them for a peculiar people, made a Covenant with
them, and for the confirmation of it, had annexed unto it the
ſeal of Circumciſion as an external ſign, had delivered them
out of the hands of their enemies, brought them into a Land

one dare manage a reproof, objecting that they are not the
children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe God ſhall proſligate and deſtroy
them, becauſe their hearts and ears are uncircumciſed, and
God ſhall again ſcatter them among the Gentiles; he ſhall
upon the very inſtant be cauterized for a falſe Prohet, and a
Liar, and deſtinated to the ſtake for bearing witneſſe unto the
truth. Neither did they here put a period to their madneſs;
they ſtand firm in their fooliſh opinions, imbracing the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
according to its outſide, the Law according to the letter,
the ceremonies, oblations, and ſacrifices in their naked repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation,
provoking not only the Prophets, but God himſelf,

is the juſt judgement of God upon them

perceive, that they soon left off to trace the way of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
ſetling themſelves upon their own carnal wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
upon the ſublime perſpicuity of their Doctors, who
after <hi>Ezra</hi> were called Scribes, as upon a new foundation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
Their Expoſitions, Ordinances, Laws, and Inſtitutions
to be of far more worth, then the Doctrine of the Prophets:
againſt which the Prophets oftentimes declaimed, but to little

eſteem more then the word of God, our Saviour Christ tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth

in which he had written his Law, and ſo ſent him a Packing to
have prevented the Iſraelites in making of their Golden Calfe?
There was ſome thing more in the wind; for God brought
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40423:20"/>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> into his own School, and there firſt gave him the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Law,<note place="margin">Rabbi Eliezer cap. 40.</note> then expounded the ſame unto him, in that time
which he ſpent in the mountain, expreſſing to the life the
cauſe, meaſure, foundation, and meaning of every Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
which Declaration finiſhed,<note place="margin">Deut. 4 14. Rabbi Aben Ezra. R Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Jarchi, R. Bechai and <hi>others on this place.</hi>
                  </note> he bids him depart the
Mountain, and relate all that he had heard to the children of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> as it is written, <hi>At the ſame time the Lord commanded
me, that I ſhould teach you Statutes and Judgements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Statutes and Judgements were that <hi>Thorah begnal peh,</hi>
that Law delivered by Mouth to <hi>Moſes,</hi> which he taught Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah, and <hi>Joſhuah</hi> the ſeventy two Elders, and by them was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to <hi>Zachary,</hi> and <hi>Malachy</hi> the laſt of the Prophets, from
whom that great Councel, the Sanhedrim, received it, and from
that time forward it was deliver'd from one unto another, in the
ſame manner that every one had learned it from his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or Grandmother. But how could <hi>Moſes</hi> know, when either
it was day or night? <hi>Rabbi Bechai, Exod</hi> 34. makes anſwer, that
upon the day time <hi>Moſes</hi> received the written Law, upon the
night that which was delivered by mouth unto him; a Doctour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
anſwer; for if it had been night, he could not have writ,
and becauſe there was never a Chandler in the Mountain <hi>Sinai</hi>
to furniſh him with Candles, he could not have had the uſe of
them, if he had desired it.</p>
               <p>But what ſhould be the cauſe that this Expoſition was onely
delivered by mouth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not in writing? <hi>Rabbi Moſche Mikkot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi,</hi>
makes anſwer; that God did it to this end, that the Gentiles
ſhould not corrupt this Expoſition, as they had corrupted the
written word, therefore in the day of Judgement, when both
Jews and Gentiles ſhall ſtand before Gods Tribunall, they ſhall
both bring with them, and preſent the written Law, hence cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
themſelves the Sons of God; then ſhall the Lord make a
further enquiry, and ſay; which of you hath the Declaration of
the Law given by mouth, in Mount <hi>Sinai?</hi> which none but
the Iſraelites ſhall know of, or can produce.</p>
               <p>To the purpoſe then, when there was no more any viſion, and
prophecies had ceaſed in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God ſtirred up the wiſeſt
among the people, who had been the Schollers of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
for this end, that they might inſtitute good Ordinances
among the Iſraelites, rightly teach and propagate the Law,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40423:20"/>
which they did, as alſo their ſucceſſours to this very day.</p>
               <p>Theſe men made it a Statute in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that the name of God,
moſt worthy of praiſe, ſhould be bleſſed every day, at the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and ſetting of the Sunne.</p>
               <p>They ordained alſo eighteen laudatory petitions, in which
every Morning and Evening we praiſe God, and beg of him
that he would beſtow upon us all things neceſſary for us, that
we might rightly fear him, as grace, wiſdome and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that he would vouchſafe to heal all our infirmities, gather

               <p>Again, that in every City ſome certain Schools ſhould be

               <p>That the Iſraelites ſhould not eat nor drink with any people

               <p>Secondly, when the City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was taken, the Temple
laid waſt the Jews overcome, led captive, and no end of their
miſery and bondage could be expected, behold, God was ſo
bountifull to <hi>Rabbi Juda Hannafi</hi> (who was the very pattern
of humility, piety, and ſanctity, that thence he was called
<hi>Rabbenu hakkadoſch,</hi> our great Maſter) that he found ſo much
grace and favour in the eyes of <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Emperour,

Law, being both delivered unto us by our Anceſtors. And in
another place he writes many things to the ſame purpoſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
it to be impoſſible to come by any expoſition agreeable
to the nature and proprietie of the Commandements of the
Law, unleſſe we lay for our foundation thoſe things which our
Wiſe-men, and Rabbines have ſpoke and written. Hence we
may conclude, that the faith of the Jews is not grounded upon
<hi>Moſes,</hi> but upon the Expoſitions of their owne Doctors,
which muſt interpret the former, as a ſure foundation of it:
as it is further confirmed in the Book <hi>Ammude Golah,</hi> called
alſo <hi>Semak</hi> or <hi>Sepher mitzvos katon:</hi> that is, the little book of
the Commandements,<note place="margin">pag. 39.</note> printed at <hi>Cremona</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> in the year
of Chriſt 1556. The words are theſe: <hi>Thou ſhalt not think that
the written word is the Groundwork, for much rather the Law
delivered by mouth only, which is the Talmud, is the true founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
And according to this Law, God made a Covenant with
Iſrael, as it is written <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 27. and theſe words are Gods
Treaſure, for God fore-ſaw that the Iſraelites in time to come
ſhould be caſt out into exile: and becauſe the people of the
Land in which they were ſtrangers would copy out &amp; interpret
their Books, as they did the written Word, God would not
have this to fall under the Pen of the Scribe; and although in
proceſſe of time it came to paſſe, that this was alſo written, yet
the Chriſtians could not comprehend the true ſence thereof, by
reaſon of its difficulty, and becauſe the interpretation thereof
requires an acute and ſublime underſtanding, as it is written:
<hi>I have written unto him the great things of my Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12.</note> but they
<hi>were accounted as a ſtrange thing:</hi> yet if <hi>Rabbi Iſaac Ben Joſeph</hi>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40423:22"/>
the eyes of his underſtanding ſo much illuminated, as to have
perceived that place of <hi>Hoſea</hi> to point at the written word;
and that this Law was not, as he complains, vilified and had in
contempt by the Gentiles, but even by the Jewes themſelves,
who had ſo debaſed it, that it ſeemed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto them as an ucouth
and unknown thing: as it came to paſſe in the dayes of <hi>Joſiah</hi>
the King, in which the Book of the Law was for a long time loſt,
and being found again by <hi>Hilkiah</hi> the High Prieſt, was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a rare and ſtrange novelty,<note place="margin">2 Kings 32.</note> as it is regiſtred in the ſecond
Book of <hi>Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt alſo follow (ſay they) that the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> above
mentioned,<note place="margin">Secundum os horum verbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> 
                  <hi>according to the tenor of theſe words,</hi> muſt, the jews
being commentators, be thus underſtood, according to the
words which were heard and received out of the mouth of God;
&amp; the ſenſe muſt be, that God made a Covenant with Iſrael, not
according to the written but unwritten Law: which interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we find in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> for in the Book <hi>Tauchum</hi> in the
Section <hi>Elle Toledos Noach,</hi> which begins at the 9. verſe of the
6. Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> we find it thus written: Our Wiſe-men ſay
that God did not write <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Secundum
os horum verborum,</hi> according to theſe words which were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by mouth only, not in writing have I made a Covenant
with Iſrael. And ſuch are the words of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> which is
harſh and difficult to them that would learn it, and therefore
likened to darkneſs, <hi>Eſay</hi> the ninth and ſecond where the words
are. <hi>The people that ſate in darkneſs have ſeen a great light:</hi>
that is, they who are much converſant in the ſtudy of the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,</hi>
ſee great light, for God inlightens their eyes to ſee how
to behave themſelves, in reſpect of things permitted and not
permitted, clean and unclean, which are not expreſſed to the
full in the written Law.</p>
               <p>A little after we read, that by reaſon of this Covenant the
World ſubſiſts, becauſe God created the day and night unto
this end, that the Iſraelites might learn the Law of Tradition,
or the <hi>Talmud</hi> by the benefit of them, and ſo ſoon as they ceaſe
to ſtudy their <hi>Talmud,</hi> day and night ſhall be no more. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ſaith <hi>Jeremy, If my Covenant be not with day and night,</hi>

                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:40423:23"/>
And what is this Covenant? The <hi>Talmud</hi> ſaith, the Jew; and
for this reaſon <hi>Jeremy</hi> a little before ſaith, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,
if you can break my Covenant of the day, and my covenant of the
night</hi> (that is, when you will no longer learn and obſerve the
<hi>Talmud) then may alſo my Covenant be broken with</hi> David <hi>my
ſervant.</hi> Hereupon <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>in the Law of the Lord is his
delight; in his Law</hi> (that is the <hi>Talmud) will he meditate day
and night:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 1. 2.</note> Yea, God himſelfe hath alſo made a Covenant with
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> that this unwritten Law ſhould never be ſubject to obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion,

Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Spirit which ſhal come upon thee, and the words that
I have put into thy mouth, ſhall never depart out of thy mouth, nor
out of the mouth of thy children from this time for ever.</hi> Here it is
not written, ſaith the Jew, <hi>from thee,</hi> but, <hi>out of thy mouth,</hi> that we
might underſtand the unwritten Law here to be meant, for the
learning of which God hath placed the day and the night, as two
common Schools. Hitherto <hi>Tanchum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, we read in the Sermons of <hi>Rabbi Bechai,</hi> which
booke he intitles,<note place="margin">1 King. 17. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Cad hakkemach,</hi> a Barrel of Meale, in that the
ſix parts of the <hi>Talmud</hi> make up the Law of Tradition, which is
the proper foundation of the written Word, conſidering that
this without that can neither be profitably expounded nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.
Hereupon in that Tract of the <hi>Talmud</hi> called <hi>Bava
meziah</hi> it is read, that to ſtudy and read the Scriptures is
profit and no profit, to wit, a ſmall profit, and not to
be regarded. But to learn the <hi>Talmud</hi> is an exerciſe worthy
of a Salary, and the workman ſhall ſurely receive it: To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
unto memory the <hi>Gemarah,</hi> which is the upſhot of the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud</hi>
is such a ſurpaſſing vertue, that it admits not of an equal.
And this is the cauſe, that the Jewiſh Rabbines and Doctors are
better verſed in the <hi>Talmud</hi> then the Bible.</p>
               <p>I am now perſwaded, that I have given a full demonſtration
of the ground of the Jewiſh faith, that it is not <hi>Moſes,</hi> but the
<hi>Talmud,</hi> that joy of their hearts, and marrow of their bones;
which may put a period to the admiration of any who won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
at their blindneſs and ſuperſtition, and they have forſaken
the way of divine truth, with a light heeled wantonneſs, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the footſteps of their Anceſtors in the way of lying.</p>
               <p>When therfore the Divel, that Father of lies, for his recreation
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40423:23"/>
would play a game at Tick Tack with the Jews, the Law of
<hi>Moſes</hi> being their ſtake; he by cogging got the dice of them,
and would not give over till he had got the double point, when
he inſpired into them this heart pleaſing conſequence: Seeing
the <hi>Talmud</hi> is the maſter point, the true ground, the right line,
according to which the written Word ought to be meaſured, cut
out, ſquared, and divided, it muſt of neceſſity follow, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of all the Rabbins ſhould be conformable unto it, &amp; as the
<hi>Talmud</hi> is ſo true that it cannot be blemiſhed with the leaſt falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
ſo is every thing that the Rabbines do either write or
teach. Now that this after game or conſequence did above all
meaſure poſſeſſe the Rabbines (who are ſuch greedy hunters af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
glory, that God and all the Prophets ſhall be tainted with a
lie, before they miſs this their prey) is apparent out of their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
proud Luciferous ſpeeches.</p>

in his Book <hi>Menoras hammaor (a</hi>) hath theſe words: all that
our Rabbines have taught or spoken, either in their Sermons or
in their myſtical and allegorical Explications, we believe as firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> In which if any thing be found ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of an hyperbole, or ſeeming clean contrary to nature, and
too high for the ſensible faculty of any mortal, we ought to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
it not to their words, but to the defect of our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
and although their ſtrains be high and lofty, and they
ſeem to preſent unto our view things incredible,<note place="margin">Tract de Sab. c. 2.</note> yet if we right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ballance them, the truth will caſt the Scales. As for example,
we read in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> that a Rabbine upon a certain time
preached that the dayes ſhall come in which a Woman ſhould
every day bring forth,<note place="margin">Jer. 31. 7.</note> grounding upon that Text, <hi>ſhe conceived
and preſently brought forth;</hi> by <hi>preſently,</hi> underſtanding <hi>dayly,</hi>
which when ſome understood not, they flouted the Rabbine,
and expoſed him to contempt. The Rabbine perceiving it, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that he ſpoke not after the vulgar faſhion of a naturall
woman, but of an Hen that dayly layd an Egge: an handſom
put off indeed.</p>
               <p>In the ſame place it is written; all their words are the words
of the living God,<note place="margin">Ib. col. 2.</note> neither ſhall any of them fall in vain unto
the earth, whereupon it is our bounden duty to believe what
ever is extant in their name, for it is the truth: neither let any
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40423:24"/>
deride them not in his heart, for so doing he ſhall not eſcape
unpuniſhed: let every one then take warning, that he ſpeak not
any thing ſcandalous either to the perſon or attempts of theſe
men, but rather to endeavour to learn ſo much as he can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
out of their writings. To the ſame purpoſe it is recorded in
a book printed in the Germane tongue, and Hebrew Letter at
<hi>Cracovia,</hi> in <hi>Poland, Anno Dom.</hi> 1597. called <hi>Brand ſpiegelium,</hi>
in the hinder end of the 48. Chapter; that the Jews are bound
to ſay Amen, not only at the end of their prayers, but to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Sermon and Expoſition upon the word of God, in which lie
hidden and profound myſteries ſhaped to the vulgar apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that by this they might ſignifie and acknowledge that
they believe whatſoever their Rabbines, or wiſe men have
ſpoken, as it is written in the Prophet <hi>Iſa. Open your ſelves, O
ye gates, for the people cometh, who keepeth Juſtice,</hi> that is, a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who ſaying Amen, believes all things that the wiſe men and
Rabbines have written, but if any mans underſtanding be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed
with such <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſſe, that he cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the <hi>aggados</hi> or expoſitions, yet he ought to believe
them; for the words of our Doctours are not wind, but truth
it ſelf. <hi>Aggadah</hi> is a myſticall or hidden ſpeech, by which hidden
matters and things of great moment are ſignified; the word it
ſelf by a certain <hi>Metatheſis,</hi> is the same with <hi>Deagah,</hi> which
ſignifies poverty and grief, because a man macerates and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
himſelf after an uncouth manner, before he can rightly
underſtand the forementioned <hi>Aggadah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto pertains that which is every where extant in the
<hi>Talmnd,</hi> to wit, that when two Rabbines are at contention, the
one affirming the other denying, none ought to contradict
them, becauſe both their Poſitious are grounded upon the <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala,</hi>
which <hi>Moſes</hi> brought with him from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and
although the one could not rightly underſtandd it, yet it is not
to be imputed unto him, for both of them know the reaſon
why they thus ſpeak, ſeeing the words of the one as well as
the other, are the words of the living God. It is alſo a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
rule in the book of the Rabbines: Rather keep in mind
the ſayings of the Scribes, than them of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
concluding from hence, that the writings and inſtructions of
the Rabbines are of greater authority, than <hi>Moſes</hi> and the

our Laws are onely two, the one written, the other delivered

therein to be nothing but the truth, but as for thy Law of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
I cannot embrace it, neither account it for a Law, but

and expound the Atticles of the Jewiſh Creed, to ſhew how
they fell from the Word of the Lord, became Apoſtates, and
renegadoes, caſting themſelves headlong into that labyrinth
of Errors, the <hi>Talmud,</hi> how they were miſerably miſled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,

falſification of the Word of God, ſuperſtition, outward pride,
eye-ſervice, the great diſquietneſs of conſcience, and horribie

to the Jewiſh Religion and exerciſe of their Faith,
in the former Chapter, wherein I fully manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
the foundation of their Beliefe, may ſerve as
a light to direct the judgement and inform the
underſtanding of any one but the image of ſtupidity, in an eaſie
apprehension how ſtrong, goodly and beautiful that edifice can
repreſent it ſelfe, which is to be reared upon ſuch a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work;
how able to keep footing againſt the fury of inſulting
Tempeſts, Thunders and Lightnings, and the Prophecies of
them, who were inriched with the true knowledge of God, and
illuminated to conceive aright of his holy Word. My deſire is,
that none ſhould be offended with this my Anatomy of the
Jewiſh Doctrine, in that without doubt it contains many things
ſubject to wonder and deriſion, and ranked in the Catalogue
of meer fables. My perſwaſion rather inclines to this mark, that
every one read and ponder the ſame with fear and trembling,
becauſe that this Doctrine had its original from thoſe people,
whom God in former times did chooſe unto himſelfe before
all the Nations of the Earth, adopted for his own children, endo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
them with the knowledge of himſelfe, and had an eſpecial
care that there never ſhould want a Prophet inceſſantlyto teach
and inſtruct them: who after that by their ingratitude they
had brought Gods anger and curſe upon them were puniſhed
with madneſs, as <hi>Moſes</hi> foretold, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. and with blindneſs,
<hi>Eſay</hi> chap. 42. whoſe heart was hardened, and whoſe ears were

                  <note place="margin">Jer. 8. 8.</note>
who not withſtanding making anſwer unto them, feared not to
affirm, that whatſoever their Scribes had in their Doctrine
imparted unto them, to be no leſs then a lie, no more then meer
and fooliſh trifles: How truly was this objected by the Prophet
ſhall in the enſuing pages more plainly appear. Certainly their
boaſting of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the reſt of the Prophets is vain and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous;
their Doctrine alſo of their Belife is altogether forged,
a manifeſt perverſion and falſifying of the Word of God by ſuch

               <p>That therefore we may orderly conſider and make known
the Jewiſh Beliefe ſo firmly grounded, we will begin with the
Nativity of a Jew; then we will explain the manner how he is
received into the number and communion of the Jews: Our
next ſtep ſhall be his Education, and by what hand he is directed
even unto the evening of his dayes; how at laſt comming to
his long home, he is carried through the hidden and profound
Chambers of the terreſtrial Globe into the Land that floweth
with Milk and Honey, the Land of promiſe, and there is royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feaſted, and ſits at the Table with his <hi>Meſſias,</hi> at which he is
invited to fill his paunch with the moſt delicate bits of a roaſted
Oxe exceeding in greatneſs the ſize of nature: fiſh and fowle
are but his common fare, and drinking no other wine then that
whoſe Grape had its growth and perfection in Paradiſe, and
there finally left by them who were his Harbingers to the grave,

would ſignifie this much, that herby they intreat God, that if the
woman bring forth a Son, he would give him a Wife like unto
<hi>Eve,</hi> not <hi>Lilis,</hi> might be a Helper, the laſt being refractory and
diſobedient. The name <hi>Lilis</hi> is found in the 34. Chapter of
<hi>Eſay,</hi> and is by ſome interpreted, a Scriech-Owl, a night bird,
commonly accounted ominous, by others a Witch that chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
the favour of children in the Cradle: and ſo the Jewes in
my judgment underſtand it of ſome diabol cal Ghoſt appearing
in the ſhape of a woman, which was accuſtomed either to kill
or carry away young Infants after their Circumciſion on the
eighth day. This Ghoſt or Spirit was named <hi>Lilis,</hi> from <hi>Lel,</hi>
which in the Hebrew tongue ſignifies night. Concerning this
matter we read a ſtory in a Book called <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n Sira,</hi> not after the
Edition of the learned <hi>Paulus Fagius,</hi> but after the Jews own
impreſſion. The copy that I have Printed at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is
the ſame with that which <hi>Sebaſtian Munſter</hi> makes mention of
in the end of his Coſmography, and out of which he tranſcribed
the Hebrew Hiſtory of the Kingdome of <hi>Preſter John,</hi> which is
also printed in the end of that Copy, which I bought of a Jew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting
thoſe parts, who had got it out of <hi>Munſters</hi> Library, for
<hi>Munſter</hi> was profeſſor of the holy tongue in this City of <hi>Baſile,</hi>
where alſo he was buried. In this Book I ſay it is recorded, that
when God had created <hi>Adam</hi> alone, and placed him in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi>
he ſaid, <hi>it was not good for Man to be alone,</hi> therefore out of the
Earth he formed a Woman like unto him, and called her <hi>Lilis.</hi>
They preſenly fell at odds, began to brawl and chide; the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſaying to the Man, I will not be ſubject unto thee, and the
Man replying, neither will I be a Vaſſal to thee, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40423:27"/>
makes anſwer, we are both equall, thou art not better then I
am, nor I better then thou, we were both faſhioned out of
the earth; and thus ſhall they continue in ſtrife and variance.
At laſt when <hi>Lilis</hi> perceivs that there is no hopes of agreement,
ſhe pronounceth the name <hi>Schem hamphoraſch</hi> (which is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> together with its ſecret and Cabaliſticall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
againſt which <hi>Luther</hi> writ a Book) and inſtantly
upon the pronunciation, flies into the air; then <hi>Adam</hi> ſaid
unto God, O Lord of the whole world, the woman which thou
gaveſt me is flown away from me. Upon the hearing hereof,
God ſent three Angels after the woman, <hi>Senoi, Sanſengi,</hi> and
<hi>Sanmangeloph,</hi> bidding them tell the woman, that if ſhe would
return and be obedient unto her Husband, all ſhould be well;
if not, that every day an hundred of her children ſhould give
up the Ghoſt. Theſe Angels having received this their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
preſently were upon the wing, and made after her, and
overtook her upon a moſt tempeſtuous place of the Sea, even
there where the Egyptians were afterwards drowned, proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto her the will of the Almighty: ſhe refuſing to return,
the Angels threatned to ſtifle and drowne her in the waters,
unleſs ſhe would obey and go back unto her Husband.
Then began <hi>Lilis</hi> to pray and beſeech them that they would let
her paſſe, becauſe ſhe was created to this end, that ſhe might
torment and put to death little Infants the eight day after their
nativity, if they were males, but upon the 20. if they were fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males.
Which ſo ſoon as the Angels perceived, they attempt
to force her to return to her Husband, which <hi>Lilis</hi> fearing,
ſwore unto them that whenſoever ſhe ſhould find the names or
ſhape of theſe three Angels, either written or painted upon any
ſcrowl, parchment, or any ſuch like matter, that then ſhe had
no power over Infants, and that ſhe would not hurt them: fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore

day one hundred of her children ſhould die the death: and ſo
accordingly it fell out, for upon one day a whole Centenary of
her off-ſpring, or ſo many yong Divels went unto their long

Angels upon certain ſorowls of par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Prophet plunged in ſorrow, hid himſelf in a certain Cave,

been very zealous for the Lord of Hoſts, for the children of Iſrael

or <hi>Queenborough,</hi> would have a young Infant of his circumciſed,
who choſe <hi>Rabbi Juda Chaſidi,</hi> which for his truly religious life
was called <hi>Rabbi Juda</hi> the holy, for a Godfather; who while
the child was brought in to be circumciſed, and the whole
congregation ſtood up and cried <hi>Baruch habha,</hi> held his peace,
and did not riſe at all. He being queſtioned concerning this
his carriage, anſwered, I perceived that <hi>Elias</hi> came not, and
ſate in the ſeat with me; from whence I collect, that this child
will never make a good man: and becauſe I ſee a certain man
ſitting in the window with a long white beard, go and ask of
him whether the words that I ſpeak be true or not, he will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
you. Well, when they had thus done, the man replied,
Be auſe <hi>Elias</hi> ſoreſaw that this child would forſake the faith of
the Jews and turn Chriſtian, therefore he would not be preſent
ate the circumciſion. And truly ſo it came to paſs, for the child
comming to riper years, was converted to Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>When therefore the Godfather hath the child lying in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
then the <hi>Mohel</hi> looſeth his ſwadling, takes hold of his yard,
laying hands upon the former part thereof by the foreskin,
thruſts down the gland thereof, which done, he rubs the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin,
that by mortifying of it the child may be leſſe ſenſible of
the cutting: then taking the knife prepared for circumciſion
out of the boyes hand that carried it, he begins to ſing with
ſhrill voice, <hi>Bleſſed be thou, O God our Lord, King of the World,
who haſt ſanctified us by thy Commandements, and given to us the
Covenant of circumciſion.</hi> In the mean time, whiles he is thus
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40423:30"/>
a diſcanting he cuts away ſo much of the fore-skin that the top
of the yard may be ſeen bare and naked, which he throws in
haſte into the Baſon filled with ſand, reſtoring the knife to him
from whom he took it, and takes one of the Cups full of red
Wine, out of which he ſucks ſo much as he can hold in his
mouth, which he preſently ſpnes out again upon the Infant to
waſh away the bloud, and alſo ſome in his face, if he perceive
him to faint: inſtantly upon this he takes the childs yard in his
mouth, and ſucks as much bloud out of it as he can poſſible, to
the end that it may ſooner leave bleeding, which bloud he caſts
out again, either into one of the bowls of red Wine, or into the
baſon of Sand. This he doth three times at the leaſt, which the
Hebrews call <hi>mezizah,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded not, but was
inſtituted by the Rabbines and wiſe men among the Jews, as it
ſeemed good unto them.</p>
               <p>After that the flux of bloud be ſomewhat appeaſed, then the
<hi>Mohel</hi> with his nails, which upon either Thumb are very ſharp,
tares aſunder the mangled skin of the childs yard, forcing it ſo
far backward, that the head of the yard may wholly appear,
which renting aſunder they call <hi>priah:</hi> by this taring of the
fore-skin the poor Infant ſuffers greater pain and griefe than he
did by the former cutting. This done, the <hi>Mohel</hi> takes the lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
rags, which one of the boyes kept ſteeped in a baſon of Oyl,
applies them to the childes yard, and binds them about three or
four times, then taking the Infant, folds him up in his ſwadling
cloaths.</p>
               <p>The whole being thus finiſhed, the Father of the child ſaith,

<hi>Iſaac, which was the Son of Abraham: let his Father rejoyce

Cups full of Wine, into that, I mean, into which he had vented
the bloud which he ſuckt out of the childs yard, and annoints
the lips of the child three times therewith, hoping that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

God, that he would defend them that are preſent, as being ſuch
men who would eftſoons confirm his covenant by the fulfilling
of it. Furthermore, that he would vouchſafe to grant a long

a bleſſing on the Babe. His <hi>Orizons</hi> ended, he reatcheth the Cup,
which he had formerly ſanctified to every one of the yong men,
and invites them to drink thereof. To conclude, all they return
with the Child, who is now made a Jew, unto his Fathers houſe,
reſtoring him into the arms of the Mother. And here is the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot
of the whole matter.</p>
               <p>Some of the learned and religious Jewes hearing the Infant
cry out, by reaſon of the pains ſuffered by him in the cime of
circumciſion, comfort themſelves with that ſentence which is
extant in the ſecond book of <hi>Moſes: I have alſo heard the

               <p>When the <hi>Mohel</hi> makes his laſt prayer, then he ſtands neare

<hi>Mohel Jered liphne hattibha;</hi> that is, he that circumciſeth ſhall
ſeat himſelfe near unto the Ark of the Covenant: or <hi>Maleach
Joſchebh liphne Haaron;</hi> that is, the Angel ſtands before the
Gate: to wit, <hi>Elias</hi> the Angel of the Covenant ſtanding
before the Ark, ſends up his prayers together with ours into the
ears of the Almighty.</p>
               <p>Some of the upright Jews take the little Infant, and both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and after his circumciſion lay him upon the bolſter or
cuſhion of <hi>Elias,</hi> that he may touch him.</p>
               <p>That they accompliſh the <hi>Priah,</hi> or denudation of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
of the Infants yard with ſo ſharp nails, they ſay that they
are moved hereunto by that ſaying in the Book of <hi>Joſhua:Take
unto thee ſharp knives,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Josh. 5.</note> (for so it is to be translated, not, knives
of stone) <hi>and circumciſe the children of Iſrael the ſecond time.</hi>
Upon these words the Wise-men among the Jews conclude, that
those words, <hi>the ſecond time,</hi> ought to be understood of the <hi>priah,</hi>
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is not other but a ſecond circumciſion. Hence iſſueth a moſt
copious queſtion, Why they which were born in the Deſart were
not circumciſed for the ſpace of forty years together? the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
is, that this came not to paſſe by reason of the ſtiff necked
malignity, and hard hearted inſolence of their Anceſtors, for
they were men of circumciſed hearts: but because bluſtering
<hi>Boreas</hi> had not blown in that Deſart, within the compaſs of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years, whoſe healthfull blaſts conduce ſo much to the letting
of bloud, that any wound, this not traviſing the terreſtrial
Globe, is accounted perillous, Hereupon they have this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal
Canon. <hi>In a cloudy day, or in that day in which the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind
blows, Circumciſion muſt not be administred, nor any vein
opened.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here it may be objected,<note place="margin">Tract. Gittin. cap. 3:</note> the Northern wind doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
blow, and yet circumciſion is dayly to be exerciſed. This
objection is anſwered in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> that four winds blow eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day, and that the Northern wind is mixt with every one in
particular, and for the moſt part obtains the predominance;
and for this very reaſon circumciſion may be dayly practiſed.
That this wind was huſht and ſtill while the Iſraelites were in
the Deſart, the very nature thereof, which is to free the aire
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40423:32"/>
from clouds, and to be the author of fair weather, is an invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
Argument, as it is written; <hi>The wind paſſeth and purgeth it,
from the North ſhall come gold:</hi> that is to ſay, with whoſe calm
clearneſs, the purity of the moſt refined gold cannot mannage
a comparison. If then this wind ſhould have blown in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart,
it had driven away and diſſolved the pillar of fire which
always accompanied the people of Iſrael, which had been to
their great damage. Here it is not lawfull for me to expoſe to
the vulgar eye any more of theſe their quirks. If any one be
raviſhed with a deſire of a further inquiry, let him read <hi>Rabbi
David Kimchi</hi> upon the fore-cited place of <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> and the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud</hi>

If an Inſant be ſickly, they do not circumciſe him upon the
eighth day, but defer it untill the time of his recovery. If any
Infant dye before the eighth day be come, then he is cicum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
in the Church-yard, over his grave, yet ſo that no Prayers
be ſaid for him. It is circumciſed to this end, that God being

raiſe him up at the laſt day. In some places it is not lawfull for

(rather indeed the perverſion) of the Rabbines, the
ſenſe muſt be this, <hi>Abraham</hi> made a great feaſt upon the eighth
day, in which his ſon <hi>Iſaac</hi> was circumciſed, and the child did
grow and was weaned: this cuſtome then, that a good banquet
ſhould be prepared, and the learned Rabbines and other up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
men among the Jews ſhould sit as gueſts, is very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable;
for <hi>David</hi> makes mention of it in his fiftieth Pſalm,
and fifth verſe, ſaying, <hi>Gather my Saints together unto me, thoſe
that have made a Covenant with me, with ſacrifice,</hi> that is, the
Covenant of Circumciſion. Inſtead of a ſacrifice then they
make this feast, ſeeing they may not ſacrifice in the Land of
their Captivity, for which they often breath out the dolefull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents
of grief and ſorrow.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mahel,</hi> or he that did circumciſe the child, is tied to
abide ſome certain dayes with the mother thereof, and to take
care that the bloud do not burst out the ſecond time: the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remains in child-bed for the ſpace of ſeven whole weeks,
whether the bring forth a male or a female, her husband
throughout all that time muſt abstain, and not approach so
near as to touch her, but it is a point of Religion to eat with
her, which he alſo doth when ſhe is in her monthly flowers,
of which more hereafter.</p>
               <p>After this manner the children of Iſrael are made Jews by
fulfilling the Covenant of Circumciſion. If the woman bring<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forth
a daughter, her nativity is nothing at all ſet by, yea ſo
little indeed, that I could not find any thing concerning this
matter recorded in their books, except that which <hi>Ferdinandus
Hessus,</hi> who a few years ago turned to the Chriſtian faith, in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40423:33"/>
which God long preſerve him, revealed unto me, to wit, that
when the new born female babe is ſix dayes old, ſome certain
number of young girls ſeat themſelves round about the Cradle,
in which the infant lies wrapp'd in fine linnen &amp; ſwadling clouts,
embroidered with ſilver, who heave the Infant together with
the cradle, many times aloft into the aire, and at length name
the child, ſhe that ſtands at the head of the Cradle being the
Godmother; which things thus finiſhed, they ſit them down
with other Damſels to a banquet prepared for them, paſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the time in eating and drinking, and other merriments.</p>
               <p>Although it is commanded in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Levit. 12.</note> that if a
woman have brought forth a man-child, ſhe ſhould for the firſt

ſhould keep at home for thirty three dayes, which added to the

one hair doth appear above the water, to this end they ſtretch

eye lids and mouth for ſome ſmall space, and ſo to bend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
that their paps hanging down in a perpendicular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
may not touch their body, that by this means the water
may come unto every part, and ſo enrich the whole body with
an exact cleaneſſe; if in the mean time ſhe fall into a ſwound, it
is not lawfull to touch her with unwaſhed hands, for this would
make her bathing void, and of no effect. Furthermore it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
that ſome man or women ſhould alwayes be preſent
while ſhe waſheth her ſelf, but a woman eſpecially, or a girl
which hath outſtript the age of twelve years by one day, but
if ſuch cannot be at hand, the Goodman may ſerve the turn,
may ſee and witneſſe, that ſhe waſheth her ſelf according as
ſhe ought. It is dangerous in their account to ſend for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
woman, for in ſuch an one they dare not put confidence.</p>
               <p>Though it be winter time, yet ought theſe waſhings to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

of the appointed puniſhment. When he was carried away to the
place of execution, there was a certain Matron ſeen in <hi>Rome</hi>
of an excellent portraiture, crying out, <hi>Wo unto that ſhip
which is about to ſtrike ſail, the Cuſtome unpayed,</hi> by which words
the Matron intimated thus much, that <hi>Ketijah,</hi> who was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to ſuffer death in the Jewſ cause, and so conſequently to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
eternall life in another world, had not as yet payed his
toll money, that is, was not made a Jew by Circumciſion. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the inſtant of this vociferation, ſome ſay that he ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a knife, and cut off his own foreskin; others, that he burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with too ardent zeal, catched hold of his foreskin, bit it off
with his teeth, and then with a loud voice ſaid, I have now at
laſt payed my Cuſtome: when they would not give him any
reſpite, but burn him in all haſte, he cryed the ſecond time,
ſaying, that he bequeathed all his goods and poſſeſſions to that
moſt learned man <hi>Rabbi Akibah,</hi> as to his lawfull heir, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
this voice was heard from heaven, <hi>Ketijah,</hi> thou ſon of
<hi>Schalom,</hi> eternal life is provided for thee. From hence every
one may learn, what a precious thing Circumciſion is, and
what a good deed it is for any one to legaſie all his goods unto
a Jew: truly, there is nothing loſt, where a man for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

this life a Jew indeed, and how that happened unto him,
which is here related. Not far from the Emperours Palace dwelt
a certain famous and moſt expert Rabbine, from whoſe houſes
to the Emperours porch came a certain hidden paſſage
under the earth, by the benefit of which they oftentimes had
private conference. Upon this occaſion, a great deſire to be
instructed in the Law, and Religion of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ews invaded the
mind of the Emperour, and for this cauſe, every day once he
repaired to the Rabbine, and heard the Law at his mouth, and
because he would not go unto the Iew without attendance,
yet alſo would not in the mean time be diſclosed, he alwayes
choſe two for his companions, whereof one he ſtabbed with his
dagger at the the entrance into the Rabbines houſe, the other
he made to drink of the ſame cup at his return to his own pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
giving alſo in charge to the Rabbine, that he ſhould have
no man in his company, when he (the Emperour) came to
viſit him.</p>
               <p>When therefore <hi>Caeſar</hi> on a certain time had found together
with the Jew, a ſtranger, whoſe name was <hi>Rabbi Chanina Bar
Chamma,</hi> which Rabbine was an holy man, and one of their
prime ones, he was ſo enraged, that he burſt out into this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation:
Did not I ſay unto thee, look that thou have
none in thy company when I ſhall come unto thee? To whom
the Rabbine replyed, My Lord and Emperour, this is not a
man, but a good ſpirit, if he be a ſpirit ſaith <hi>Caeſar,</hi> let him
go and ſignifie ſo much to my ſervant, who lies and takes his

he became a Serving man at his Pedagogues Table.
Yea moreover, when the Rabbine at night would please to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40423:37"/>
viſite his Couch, the Emperour bowing himſelfe at his bed ſide,
became his Footſtool, that his Maſter the Rabbine might with
more facility ſtretch his limbs upon his bed of Down, the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
indeed in many kinds, ſtrived to repel the tendered ſervice,
but all in vain, for the Emperor did not only perform theſe
earth kiſſing Congees with an humility of mind, floating in
the loweſt ebb, but alſo wiſhed it might be his happineſs to be
his footſtool in another world. At length the Jews had an ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
demonſtration that this Emperor before he entred the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
room of the grave, did receive the ſign of circumciſion,
profeſſed himſelfe a Jew, and died in this profeſſion. Many
examples of the ſame ſort are every where obvious in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings

               <p>The wiſe Scribes among the Jewes in their <hi>Gemara,</hi> propoſe

               <p>We read a ſtory of the ſame ſtamp in <hi>Medraſch</hi> or a certain
little book of Sermons, that when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of Egypt had
commanded that all the male children of Israel ſhould be caſt
into the River, the Hebrew women ran into the open fields,
and there brought forth their yong ones; if they were males,
the earh like an indulgent mother, received them into her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome;
which done, God created for the uſe of every one of
them two ſtones, out of the one of which they might ſuck milk,
out of the other honey: and thus they were preſerved under
the earth untill they came to ripeneſs of years, and were grown
manlike, at what time every one returned unto his mother.</p>
               <p>In the ſame place it is read that good <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſuckt the
teats of <hi>Esther,</hi> which was the cauſe, that ſhe being Queen
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40423:38"/>
heaped ſo many good turns upon him, that from a poor man
he roſe to a great Potentate. What Mother then can indure
that her child ſhould be deprived of dayly food?</p>
               <p>The Moraliſts wanting of modeſty, and every other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
vertue, ſay, that the caſe ſtands with the good Wife of the
houſe, as it doth with a Viceroy ſet over ſome certain Kingdom
and Inhabitants thereof. He ſo proving faithfull to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigd,
and uſing the Subjects well, makes the Kingdome to
grow better, and the revenues to increaſe, purchaſeth unto
himſelfe a plentifull reward; that at laft, by the accumulation
of honours, he is heaved up to ſome honorable title, and is
capped for a great Lord. But if the contrary be by him put in
execution, he is not onely caſhier'd of his reward, but the
clouds of imperiall diſcontent caſt a horrid lour upon his houſe,
and the Gallow tree muſt be his lives laſt period. So the good
wife of the house like a Viceroy, is placed over her children; if
ſhe have an inceſſant care that they be provided with meat and
drink ſufficient, then ſhall the Infants hearts be inlarged for the
entertainment of a polite behaviour, and the practiſe of good
works; ſhe alſo ſhall have a reward both in this life and
that which is to come, having a place allotted her together
with the juſt in that Garden of pleaſures, Paradiſe. But if ſhe
feed her children with groſſe meats, ſuch as may make a chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
incloſure of their hearts, then God ſhall cut her off, and
caſt her headlong into the infernal pit.</p>
               <p>The Mother muſt not too often bear that part of her breaſt
which is next unto her heart, leſt hereby the milk becomming
immoderately cold, should afterwards be the occasion of some
maladies to the ſucking Infant, and hinder his growth. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
ſhe muſt have a ſpecial care that ſhe faſt not two long in a
morning, but early take ſome warm broath, which turned into
good nouriſhment, may alſo become the childs ſuſtenance; ſhe
muſt not ſuffer her children to go naked at any time, not upon
the day, leſt the Sun, nor upon the night, leſt the Moon ſhould
hurt them,<note place="margin">Pſal. 121 6.</note> as it is written: <hi>The ſun ſhall not hurt thee by day,
nor the Moon by night.</hi> She muſt not ſuffer any to carry them to
bed naked, or that they themſelves ſhould approach their couch
being thus unvailed. Moreover, it is not lawful for them to riſe
out of their bed naked, but a most diligent care is had that their
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40423:39"/>
ſhirts be put on and off at their lying down and riſing up, that
they may early be accuſtomed to a reverent baſhfulness in the
eyes of the Almighty, and ſpeedily be rapt into this contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
that the whole earth is full of the Majeſty of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and that in his ſight the darkness is like the light it ſelfe:
for the ſame reaſon they are always to go with their heads co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
becauſe the Divine Majeſty doth alwayes hover over
them, their wiſe men bearing witneſs If any chance to go
without his honnet, he practiſeth nothing less then the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of his fore front againſt the Majeſty of the Omnipotent;
and from thenceforth becomes impudent, forgetfull of God
and his Commandements. Conducible to this purpoſe we read
a ſtory in <hi>Gemara:</hi> That upon a time the Elders and Senators
of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> ſitting in the gate, two yong youths paſt by them,
the one with his head covered, the other with his bonnet vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
which <hi>Rabbi Eliezer</hi> observing, ſaid, The boy that goes
bare head is a baſtard: and <hi>Rabbi Jehoſuahes</hi> verdict was, he
was the ſon of a polluted woman: <hi>Rabbi Akibhah</hi> affirmed
both to be true. Hereupon <hi>Rabbi Akibhah</hi> asked his mother
how ſhe came to have ſuch a ſon? ſhe anſwered, when I firſt
entred into the bond of matrimony with my Husband, I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean;
and for this cauſe my husband did ſeperate himſelf from
me, that according to the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> he might not keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with me all the dayes of mine uncleanneſſe: in the mean
time one of his companions came in unto me, and got me with
child, by the which act of copulation I had this my Son. Whence
it appears to be a sign of an untowardly dispoſition in any child
to walk bare headed. From the ſeventh year untill the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
they have a serious and impulſive admonition given
time not to go uncovered, after which time they are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to uſe the geſture.</p>
               <p>The children of the Jews from their very infancy, are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to wear a girdle, and truly their honeſt Matrons faſten
it to the hinder part of their coats, that by this means they may
always be mindfull of it; for the girdle ſevers their heart from
the ſecret parts, leſt the heart in time of prayer might be hindred
in its devotion by beholding the privities.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as this infant Jew hath learnned his morning pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,

girdle he is girded withall; for if he have none about him,
then is this his prayer of no moment, but in vain, and imputed
to him for a ſinne.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the children are not permitted to go barefoot,
for fear of a multiplicity of dangers, which might happen unto
them, and that especially in the Moneths of <hi>December</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi>
when the Cats dance their <hi>Corantoes;</hi> for at that time

               <p>When they cannot as yet ſpeak plainly or readily, they are

               <p>When the children are seven years old, then by their Parents,

So ſoon as any one hath made ſo much progreſſe in this kind,
that he can read, then firſt of all he is taught to conſtrue the
Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> in that language with which he was brought
up. In a certain book called <hi>Schebkile emunah,</hi> it is recorded,
that when the mother brings her ſon the firſt time unto School
to the Rabbine, that ſhe ought to give unto him ſome delicious
wafers made with Sugar and hony, and to ſay theſe words,
<hi>Even as this wafer is ſweet, ſo let the Law be ſweet unto thy heart,
let it be like ſugar upon thy tongue, and hony upon thy lips, ſee that

Humane Law is comprehended.</p>
               <p>At thirteen years of age he is called <hi>Bar Mizvah,</hi> the ſon

he ſin, and do not execute that is commanded, then is he
liable to be puniſhed both by the Law of God and man. What
ſin ſoever he committed before the thirteenth year of his age,
his Father must ſuffer for it.</p>
               <p>Which is the reaſon, that the child comming to theſe years,
his father cals ten Jews unto him, and in their preſence witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
that this his Son is come to full age, and being inſtructed
in the Commandements, hath learned the manner and cuſtome
of the <hi>Zizim</hi> and <hi>Tephillim,</hi> (of which more anon) as alſo the
form of bleſſing and his daily prayers: for which reaſon he
would be freed from him; that he might not from henceforth
ſmart for his offences, he being ſuch an one who is to become
<hi>Bar mitzuah,</hi> the Son of the Commandements, and ought to
ſuffer for his ſins in his own proper perſon. This being confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the ten Jews there preſent, the Father ſaith a certain
short prayer, in which chiefly he gives God thanks, that he
hath delivered and unburdened him of the punishment due unto
his son for his sin; further intreating him, that his ſon by the
help of the Divine grace, may for many daies remain ſafe and
without danger, and be industrious in good works.</p>
               <p>In the fifteenth year of their age, all the children of the Jews

with an exact diligence that the ſuffer not the word of God and

to whom he anſwered, I had never ſince I was born, the leaſt
meditation of any thing contained in the Word of God, neither

               <p>When any one is to eaſe himſelf, he may turn his face either
towards the North or South, but by no means toward the Eaſt or
Weſt, becauſe a due reverence ought to be had of, and tendred

that in reſpect of the great danger that may enſue thereupon, for
the hand in the morning is a thing moſt impure and venomous, by
reaſon of the unclean &amp; evil ſpirits, which reſt upon the hands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till

hands, they ſhall become blind; if his ears, they ſhall be ſtopped
with deafneſſe; if his noſtrils, they become obnoxious to a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
diſtillation; if his mouth, it ſhall be vexed with ſtinking; if

for without this Ceremony it is not allowable that the one hand
ſhould touch the other. No man in waſhing ought to be ſparing
of water; for <hi>Rabbi Chaſda</hi> ſaith, that whoſoever uſeth plenty
of water in the waſhing of his hands, ſhall be a man of great
riches. They muſt lift their hands on high in time of waſhing,
leſt the unclean water reſulting out of the Baſon ſhould repollute
them. In the next place they ought to waſh their mouth and face,
becauſe this was created according to Gods own image, as it is
written, <hi>God created man in his own likeneſſe, according to the image
of God created he him.</hi> The Rabbines illuſtrate the whole matter by
this ſimilitude. An Artificer one who is Maſter of his trade, makes
ſome goodly veſſel, and therewith gratifies one of his deareſt
friends. This his friend knowing of his approach, and ſeeing the
Crafts man coming to his houſe, takes the veſſel, ſcours, and
makes it as clean as he can poſſible, left the workman ſhould be
wroth and angry, that he kept not this his handy work from filth
and pollution. In like manner, any Jew, who every day in the
morning frequents the Synagogue appears in the preſence of God
his Creator, and is bound to worſhip and honour him, ought
alſo accurately to waſh his face, leſt the chief workman ſhould be
angry to behold his creature disfigured with uncleanneſſe.</p>

keep himſelf cleanly for the good of his body. How can any call
upon God with his mouth, when as yet it is filled with ſpittle and

a baſon or ſome other veſſel, not over the earth, which done, it
is not lawfull for him to pour out his water where any one tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
yet are there found men who practiſe the contrary, for the
promotion of their art in poyſoning, and skill in Magick. The
face being waſhed, great curioſity muſt be uſed in the drying of
it; for he who does not take care thereof, ſhall have his face ſo
bloſſomed with budding Ale pocks, ſo imbroidered with wrinkles,
that the deformity thereof will become loathſome to the eye of

with a woollen cloath (which ſome ſlothfull perſons bluſh not a
whit to do) for according to their Doctors, this deſtroys the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
and annihilates the underſtanding. After waſhing every
one ought to give thanks, ſaying. <hi>Bleſſed art thou, O God our God,
King of the whole world, who haſt commanded us to waſh our hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In generall, they ought continually to waſh their hands after
theſe things following. In the morning ſo ſoon as they are up, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their return from the houſe of office, after they come out of
the Bath, when they pair their nails, after that they have drawn
their ſhoes from their feet, the hands being miniſters, when any
hath ſcratched himſelf upon his naked skin, when he hath touched
a dead Corps, or gone through the middle of dead folks, when
he hath had carnall copulation with his wife, or laſtly, after the
killing of alouſe, whosoever he be that doth any of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
things, and doth not waſh his hands thereupon, if he be a
learned man he ſhall forget his learning, and turn blockhead, if
he be not learned he ſhall loſe the uſe of every one of his ſenſes.</p>
               <p>Now the Jew is ſufficiently cleanſed, and mundified for his

which for the moſt part they put on together with their other gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
at their upriſing, but ſome when they are about to pray.
The parts of this quadrangular garment are two, being for the
moſt part made of linnen, but often of ſilk, bound and faſtened
together in the higheſt part thereof with two little bands, yet of
a great heighth, ſo that they may put their head in betwixt them,
ſo that the one of theſe fourſquare parts may hang upon the breaſt,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40423:45"/>
the other upon the back. The Jews, in reſpect of the four angles,
call this garment <hi>Arba Cauphos:</hi> in every one of theſe four angles
hang certain Ribbands, woven of white woollen threads, coupled
by a certain knot, and hanging towards the ground, which are
four, eight, or twelve fingers broad; theſe they call <hi>Zizim,</hi> of
which they write wonderful and ſtrange matters, whereof I will
relate a parcel.</p>
               <p>They who would be accounted very ſincere and holy, are wont
dayly to put on this their cloak or garment, wearing in it under
their long coat, but after ſuch a manner, that the ends of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
ſtringes, or hangbies may be always in their ſight: ſome
wear them upon their breaſts; others not at all, but in time of
Prayer. It is hehoofull that the two foreſaid parts, together with
their appurtenances ſhould hang towards the ground, both at the
fore and hinder part of their body, that they may always be full of
the Commandements of the Lord. When they put theſe on, then
they ſay ſome certain Prayers, giving thanks unto God that he
hath commanded them to inveſt themſelves with theſe garments.
Theſe ought to admoniſh them always to have before their eyes
Gods Commandements, that hereby being ſcared from ſin, they
might be prickt forward to a due performance of them: as it is
written: <hi>Speak unto the children of Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lev. 15: 37<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>28.</note> 
                  <hi>and bid them that they
make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their
generations, and that they put upon the fringe of their borders a rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
of blew. And it ſhall be unto you for a fringe, that you may look
upon it and remember all the commandements of the Lord, and do them,
and that you ſeek not after your own heart, and your own eyes, after
which you are wont to go a whoring, that you may remember and do
all my Commandements, and be holy unto the Lord your God.</hi> But out
of theſe words their Wiſe men conclude, that the eyes and heart are
the mediators for ſin.</p>

               <p>In the fore mentioned Tract, we read of a certain man hindred
from commiting sin, and a ſtrange woman converted unto Judaiſm
by this Commandement. Upon a time a yong man among the
Jews, very learned and ſtudious, but much given to Venery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a famous and beautiful Whore, who living in a neighboring
City, had much trading, and yet ſold ſin at ſo dear a rate, that for
one ſingle laſcivious abuſe of her body, ſhe required no leſs then
four hundred pounds, ſent her the money, appointed the time at
which ſhe was to expect his luſtfull imbracements. The day come,
the yong man, according to their Covenant, repaired unto her
houſe, where he found her in a cloſet ſitting in a chair all imbroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

moſt exact and exquiſite faſhion that Art could invent, which
ſerved as fewel to inflame his luſt, and haſtened him to this unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
act: but behold as he went up into the bed, his fringes ſmote
him on the face, whereat forthwith aſtonished, and put in mind of
the Commandement, he fell upon the ground, repreſt his fleshy
deſires, and utterly refuſing any more to touch or imbrace
his formerly admired Miſtriſs: whereupon ſhe demanding of him
what defect he had eſpied in her, that he thus refuſed his purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
pleaſure? he replies, that the Lord God commanded the Jews
to do him ſervice, and for a more eaſie performance of the ſame,
gave them a ſign, which when they beheld<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they might remember
his Commandements, which ſign put me in remembrance of the
ſame, and deterred me from committing the offence. Hereupon
ſhe asked him his name and whence he was? which when he had

he was? to whom (demanding her buſineſs) ſhe declared the whole

her for a Proſelite and joyned her in marriage to the

which in after times came to be great Doctors and learned
Rabbines, ſhe until the moment of her death continuing conſtant
in the Profeſſion of the Jewiſh Religion. In like manner it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
that theſe Fringes and Ribbands upon the shirts of

him from committing folly with <hi>Ruth,</hi> when ſhe lay at his

to take away by, ſtealth a violent commotion ſhattered all his

               <p>The Women are not tied to put on or wear this cloak or coat

               <p>In the firſt place they chooſe out a four ſquare piece of black lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in quantity but ſmall, of an Oxe or Cows hide, which they
fold eight times; so making four distinct houſes, or receptacles,
unto which they do put four diſtinct pieces of parchment, in which
are written the ten Commandements, and other parcels of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which are thought to be the four Sections of the Law. The
firſt beginning, <hi>Sanctifie unto me all the firſt born, Exod,</hi> 13. 2. to
the end of the 10. verſe. The ſecond at the 11. verſe, continuing
unto the end of the 16. The third beginning at the 4. verſe of the
6. chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and ending at the tenth verſe. The
fourth <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 13. ending at the 22. verſe. Then they take ſome
few hairs pulled out of the taile of an Oxe or Cow, which they
waſh very clean, and therewithall binde together the foreſaid
parchments, yet in ſuch a manner that the ends thereof may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
out of the skin, to this end, that every man may take notice
that they are good and not ſophisticate. The skin into whoſe folds
they put theſe parchment writings, they ſow together with ſmall
ſtrings taken out of the bodies of Oxen or Kine, or made of Buls
ſinnews, which if they cannot have, then inſtead thereof they
uſe ſmall thongs cut out of the skin it ſelfe. Finally, to the foreſaid
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40423:47"/>
fourſquare piece of leather, or skin thus folded and ſowed, they
faſten another long black thong, which they knot about it: the
whole piece thus framed and faſhioned, they call their <hi>Tephillin</hi>
or prayer ornaments, ſerving to put them in remembrance of the
ſerious and often execution of ſuch an exerciſe; theſe they bind
about their head in that manner, that the great knot, in which are
contained the parcells of holy Writ, may be faſtened directly upon
the forehead, between the eyes, over againſt the brain, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the memory of Gods Commandements may be therein imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

and that ſo exactly, that every Letter is placed in the right order,
which is accounted as a moſt holy thing, producing hidden effects
and comprehending myſticall ſignifications.</p>
               <p>Concerning theſe Phylacteries, the Rabbines have written di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and ſundry volumes, great and large, out of which it will not
be a miſſe to recite a few things: And firſt, for the writing of them,
It is holden behovefull and neceſſary, that they be written with
ink made of galles, and not with that pitchy ſort which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
uſed of Printers and ſilk Dyers, or with any other liquor
of a red or any other colour. Secondly, every Letter muſt be
written, one not adhering or cleaving unto another. 3. They muſt
be written with the right hand, not with the left, nothing muſt
be blotted out or corrected from the beginning to the end; ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as the Scribe ſhall write the name of God, he muſt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
to ſay, and that in expreſſe words, that he writes theſe Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries
for Gods glory; for hereby he ſhall perform what he is
about with far greater diligence, which is very neceſſary, seeing
that if any Letter do either ſuperabound or be deficient, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries
become unholy and polluted, and whoſoever ſhal use
them in time of prayers, prates in vain, and keeps not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
as they ought: the due puniſhment for which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
ſhall onely reſt upon the head of the Scribe, of whom an
eſpeciall care is to be had, that he be a Jew, honeſt, holy, pious,
diligent, and expert.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the skin and parchment, they ought to be of a
heifer, or ſome other clean beaſt, and by Gods Law allowed to
be eaten: the beaſt muſt be killed by a Jew, not by a Chriſtian,
as alſo tanned and dreſſed by a Tanner of their own Nation; yet if
there be no ſuch man to be had, the Jew may take a Chriſtian
Tanner to help him, and it is ſufficient that this skin ought to be
the skin of a clean beaſt, and permitted to be eaten, they prove
out of thoſe words of <hi>Moſes, That the Law of the Lord may be
in thy mouth;</hi> for thoſe parcels of Scripture being written upon
the skin, it is all one as if they were written upon every part of
the whole beaſt, and so in meal-time were received in at the
mouth, which they ſhould not, if they were written upon the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40423:48"/>
skin of the unclean, and forbidden to be eaten. Much more
might be ſaid concerning this matter, but I ſurceaſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the ſanctity and holineſſe of these Phylacteries is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great; for firſt, the body of him that wears them muſt be
free from all pollution, both inwardly and outwardly, which
ſeeing it cannot be at all ſeaſons, it is thought expedient that a
man ſhould put them on in time of prayer, becauſe prayer ought
to procceed from a pure and clean heart. Again, whoſoever ſhall
ſuffer them by negligence to fall upon the ground, makes not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
himself liable to faſt for the whole day, but alſo all thoſe that
ſhall behold them lying thereupon. It is not lawfull to hang
them up by their ſtrings againſt any wall uncovered, but it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
they be put in bag or ſachell: they may not be left in the
chamber where a man and his wife lyes together, unleſſe they be
put in a bag three double, and locked up in a cheſt. It is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
for any man to ſleep, eſpecially on ſet purpoſe while he
hath theſe Phylacteries about him, yet if ſleep chance to creep on
him unawares, he becomes not hereby guilty of any crime; yet if
in the time hereof, any uncleanneſſe happen unto him, he cannot
lawfully touch the knot wherein the parcells of Scripture are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and contained, yet he may unlooſe the thong, and lay the
Phylacteries aſide, untill he hath purified himſelf, and waſhed his
hands, and then put them on again.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, it is not lawfull for any one to let a ſcape, or eaſe
himſelf, having theſe Phylacteries about him, if he be neceſſitated
to do either, he muſt firſt lay them aſide in a place four ells di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from that wherein he ſhall eaſe himſelf, or put them into a
bag, and hide them in his boſome next unto his heart.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, women, ſervants, and others alſo not well in body,
are not tied to the wearing of theſe Phylacteries, either becauſe
ſuch perſons are not all times clean, or becauſe they cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
attend the time of prayer, by reaſon of that ſervice which
they are enjoyned by their Maſters and Miſtreſſes; for according
to the <hi>Rabbines,</hi> the women are onely bound to obſerve theſe
Commandements which may be performed at certain times, not
them whoſe execution is daily required<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſeeing it is ſaid, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.
13. 19. That the Law of the Lord may be in thy mouth:</hi> where
the inſtitution of this order is mentioned, it neceſſarily follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that they onely are tied to the obſervation of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40423:49"/>
whoſe office it is to have the Law of the Lord in their
mouths, and to teach it to others, which is not required of the
female ſex, and conſequently they are not liable to the wearing
of theſe Phylacteries, notwithſtanding that of the Doctors, who
ſay, that they were worn by the wife of <hi>Jonas</hi> the Prophet; for it
is ſuſſicient that they ſay <hi>amen</hi> to every Petition, ſeeing hereby
they confeſs that they believe and hope for whatſoever their
Husbands ſhall require at the hands of God in theſe their prayers.
Of this their ſaying <hi>amen</hi> spoke <hi>Iſa,</hi> the Prophet, ſaying, <hi>Open
your gates that the righteous Nation may enter in,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 26. 2.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Briefly, how the Phylacteries ſhould be written upon the fleſhy,
not hoary ſide of the skin or parchment; how the letter <hi>Schin</hi>
ſhould be wrought upon the great boſs or knot; the letter <hi>Daleth</hi>

               <p>Laſtly, leaſt we ſhould omit the time of their morning Prayer,
I will only relate one ſtory, and that worthy credit out of the
<hi>Talmud,</hi> conducible to the matter now in hand, and that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of a certain miracle, of which kind one was formerly regiſtred
concerning the Fringes.</p>
               <p>It is written in <hi>Maſſeches Schabbas</hi> that theſe were the words
of <hi>Rabbi Janna,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tract de Sab. cap. 18.</note> that whoſoever had a deſire to put on the Phyla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteries,
ought to have as clean a body as <hi>Eliſha Baal Cappajim,</hi> or
<hi>Eliſha</hi> with wings, had, And why I pray you is he named <hi>Eliſha
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40423:49"/>
with wings?</hi> the anſwer in the <hi>Gemara</hi> is ſhaped according to this
faſhion: Upon a certain time the Roman Emperor publiſhed a
moſt ſevere Edict, that any Jew ſhould not wear any Phylacteries,
and that upon pain of loſing his head: now in ancient times the
Jews were accuſtomed to bind their Phylacterie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> upon their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads
all the day long. To proceed, this <hi>Eliſha</hi> being a man of
undanted courage and little eſteeming the Roman Edict, never
ceaſed to tie theſe parchments about his head. But upon a certain
time, being conſcious that the Apparitor ſaw him, he tooke him
to his heels, and without any delay ſnatching the Phylacteries
from his head, hid them in his hand: The Apparitor apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him, would needs know what he carried in his hand? He
anſwered, I carry Doves wings; then ſaid the Apparitor, either
let me ſee them, or elſe thou dieſt for it; whereupon <hi>Eliſha</hi> opened
his hands, and it was even ſo as he had ſpoken, and from this very
action was he called <hi>Eliſha with the wings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what reaſon may be pretended that <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſhould say, that
he carried Doves wings, rather then the wings of a Stork or a
Crow, or some other bird? The <hi>Gemara</hi> gives this anſwer, ſaying;
that the Iſraelites are like nnto a Dove, for as the Dove hath all
her ſtrength in her wings, with which ſhe doth fortifie and defend
her ſelfe againſt all other birds, of what kind ſoever, being not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to uſe bill, feet, or any other member in maintenance of
the quarrell: ſo the Israelites alſo are wont to do, for their wings
are the Commandements of God, which do manage and ſupport
them againſt all evil, that there is no poſſibility of ſuffering any
harme from other Nations.</p>
               <p>This Query is also anſwered in this maner: that as the wings of
Doves are more auxiliatory unto them then thoſe of any other
bird nnto it; for the Dove wearied in flight, reſting on the one
wing, flies with the other, but other birds in the ſame caſe are
forced to light upon ſome tree, or rock, or upon the earth; ſo
the Iſraelites ſuffring great perſecution for ſome one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
by reaſon where of they cannot fulfill it, they fulfill
the reſt, by the merit where of they have help, and a ſtrong tower
of defence againſt all their enemies; therefore it ſhal come to paſs,
that if any one do with all diligence obſerve and keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
he ſhall not come within the liſts of any evil
project, but ſhall in a wonderfull manner be delivered from all
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40423:50"/>
his enemies, as this winged and penfeatherd <hi>Eliſha</hi> was delivered
from the Apparitor who threatned him with cruel death, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Rabbines have avouthed, being certified of the truth
thereof by their toothleſs Grandames and hereupon have not
feared to inſert it into the <hi>Talmud.</hi>

laſt they begin their devotions accordingly as they are appointed in
their book of Common-prayer, and becauſe the Petitions are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many, they run them over by a curſory reading of them in
their books, although ſome be ignorant of Letters, and cannot
read at all, yet it is his duty to be frequent in the Synagogue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any intermiſſion, diligently attending what is ſaid by others,
and ſaying <hi>Amen</hi> at the cloſure of every prayer.</p>
               <p>That we may the better underſtand what manner of prayers
they uſe, I will tranſlate ſome of their prayers out of the Hebrew

               <p>The firſt prayer they uſe begins thus, <hi>Adon Olam, aſcher melech,</hi>
&amp;c. running all in rythme, as all others of theirs do, and is
ſung or read by them in a bouncing tone; the form of which pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

                  <hi>O Lord of the world, who had rule and dominion before any thing
now created, was created; who was called a King at the inſtant of
their Creation, according to his good pleaſure, and ſhall ſo remain
after their return into their prime nothing, to whom be given all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and fear.</hi> He <hi>was from everlaſting, and ſhall alwayes abide in
his glory: he is one alone, and beſides him there is no other, who may
be compared or be likened unto him</hi> (by this reason they deny the
Deity of the Son, and repute him as a common ſimple man) <hi>He,
as he is without beginning, ſo he is without end. In his hand is ſtrength
and power, he is my God, my protectour, and redeemer</hi> (by this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they deride the belief of us Chriſtians, who do place our
Confidence in a Mediatour, who himſelf was ſubject to the ſtroke
of death) <hi>He is a ſtony rock unto me in my neceſſity, and in the time

               </p>
               <p>This prayer being ended then follow in their order an hundred
more, which are commonly ſhort and pithy, and are therefore
twice repeated every day, the reaſon whereof ſhall be given here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>The firſt bleſſing prayer, or thankſgiving is about the waſhing
of their hands, as was formerly declared, and that, becauſe if any

forget to ſay it in the morning when he is waſhing his hands, he is
injoyned to ſay it before the whole Congregation.</p>
               <p>In the next place they have a thankſgiving, though ſhore
and ſuccinct, for the wonderfull Creation of man, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
that God created him full of holes and pores, one
whereof being ſtopped, ſudden death neceſſarily follows there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
               <p>Then they make their Confeſſion concerning the Reſurrection
of the dead, giving thanks for the gracious ſupply of all their
wants, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed be thou O Lord,</hi> King of the World, who
haſt given underſtanding to the Cock, ſo that he knows how to

               <p>Bleſſed be God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he hath not created me a ſervant;
this alſo thwarts the profeſſion of Chriſtians, whom they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
their vaſſalls, who ſhall ſow and plow their ground, and
ſhall do all manner of ſervile imployments for them, while in the
mean time they ſhall ſit behind a hot fornace roſting apples,
toſſing up whole bowls of wine. What kind of Captivity is this?
They anſwer, if any man rest himſelf in any place, having a huge
Bowl of rich wine in his hand, then he is free from bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
when on the contrary, the Chriſtians are forced to

               <p>This Thankſgiving is uſuall when they firſt wake out of their
ſleep, and unſhut their eye-lids.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who makes the crooked ſtraight; this they ſay,

               <p>Bleſſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who bringeth the priſoners out of Captivity.</p>
               <p>Theſe two ſeverall Thankſgivings are aſſigned for this reaſon,
becauſe God in the time of ſleep doth in that manner ſuſtaine
and multiply mans ſpirits, that they may again exerciſe their
proper functions, the time of their being aſleep being like unto
priſoners in the pit.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who ſtretcheth out the earth above the waters;
this they say, when riſing out of their beds, they begin to tread
upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who directs, prepares and governs the wayes of
man; this he ſaith, ſo ſoon as he comes out of his bed-chamber.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who hath created all things neceſſary for this life;
this he utters when he ties his ſhooes.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who girdest Iſrael with the girdle of ſtrength;
this he ſaith, when he puts on his girdle, which every Jew is
bound to do, as hath been formerly declared.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed, &amp;c. who crowns Iſrael with comelineſſe; this he ſaith,
when he puts his hat upon his head, for it is an hainous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

who removeſt ſleep from mine eyes, and ſlumber from mine eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids.</p>
               <p>Theſe prayers ended, being ſo many in number, they adde
two more, wherein they petition God, that he would vouchſafe to
keep and defend them againſt ſin, reprobate angels, &amp; wicked men,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40423:53"/>
and all kind of evil. Then humbling themſelves before God, they
confeſs themſelves guilty, and relying only upon the mercy of
God, they comfort themſelves again with a certain Prayer, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<hi>Ribbon Col haolamim;</hi> and with much boaſting and many
brags in that oath which the Lord ſware unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to ſacrifice his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſay, yet we are thy people, and the
children of thy Covenant: and, O bleſſed men that we are! how
goodly is our portion? how pleaſant our lot? how beautifull
our Inheritance? O bleſſed men that we are, who every morning
pronounce this ſentence, <hi>Heare O Iſrael, the Lord our God is one
God!</hi> Gather us that truſt in thee from the four corners of the
earth: by which action all the Inhabitants of the world ſhal know
that thou art God alone. O our Father which art in heaven, run
after us with thy mercy even for thy names ſake, becauſe thy name
is named upon us, and confirm and eſtabliſh in us that which is
written,<note place="margin">Soph. 3. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>At that time will I bring you back, at that time will I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you, and give you a name and renown amongst all the people of the
earth, when I have turned againyour captivity, ſaith the Lord God.</hi>
After theſe be ended, there follow 2 other ſhort Prayers, in which
they give thanks for the Law delivered to them from heaven. From
the Law they proceed to their ſacrifices, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> becauſe they may not
offer in theſe dayes, they are baniſht out of their own Land, &amp; their
Temple is laid deſolate, as their Anceſtors were accuſtomed, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of the lip ſucceeds in the place thereof, and reading only the
precepts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning ſacrifices, as they ought in their appointed times
to have been offered. they solace themſelvs with that ſaying of the
Prophet,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 3.</note> though in a ſenſe perverted, <hi>We will ſacrifice the calves
of our lips.</hi> After this they ruminate the hiſtorical narration about
ſacrifices, as alſo a certain prayer beginning <hi>Rabbi Iſmahel</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the uſe of the Law, and the manifold expoſition thereof:
which being grounded upon the <hi>Talmud,</hi> is so barbarous and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
that not one Jew amongſt an hundred is able to underſtand
it. This they read in ſuch a manner, as the Veſtal Virgins do the
Pſalter. This done, they ſay a Prayer, in which they Petition for
the re-edification of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Temple, which they daily,
even unto this day expect and hope for; yet this they ſay with
ſuch a fainting voice that none can hear it. The words are theſe:
<hi>Let it be thy good pleaſure before thy face, O Lord and God, the God of
our Fathers, that the holy houſe, thy Temple may be built again in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40423:53"/>
theſe our dayes, and give unto us a will to abide in thy Law.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
riſing up with great joy and ſhouting, they chant out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
laudatory Prayer or thankſgiving, hoping that God will
ſhortly begin to lay the foundation of their new Temple, and bring
them back again into their own Land. Then ſitting down, they
repeat a long Prayer collected out of the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> reading
withall ſome whole Pſalmes, and a part of the thirtieth Chapter
of the firſt book of Chronicles: and laſtly, ſinging the laſt words
of the Prophet <hi>Obadiah,</hi> which are theſe: <hi>Saviours ſhall come up
on mount Zion to judge the Mount of Eſau,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obad. 2. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Kingdome ſhall
be the Lords.</hi> With attent minds and much rejoycing, their hope
is that theſe Saviours of whom the Prophet makes mention, ſhall
come quickly, and ſhall go up to Mount <hi>Sion:</hi> that is, they ſhall
undertake the quarrel for the Jews, and help them to judge, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Stroy,
and utterly to extirpate from the face of the earth the
Mountain of <hi>Eſau;</hi> that is to ſay, the Chriſtians, together with

               <p>Then they begin to ſing, God ſhall be King over the whole

of their faith; <hi>Rabbi Akibha</hi> not regarding the command,
ceaſed not to read and preach it openly in the Synagogue; upon
which he was apprehended, and for the fact caſt into Priſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When
the Tormentors were about to bring him to the ſtake to be burnt,
they firſt of all curried his corps with an iron horſecombe, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and tormenting him after a lamentable manner. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<hi>Rabbi Akibha</hi> remained conſtant, praying without
intermiſſion. And when the time of the day came wherein he was
to ſay that Prayer, <hi>Krias Schema,</hi> he begun it with great boldneſs.
At the laſt his Scholers beſpoke him and ſaid, Moſt dearly beloved
Maſter, thou haſt prayed ſufficiently, now yield thy ſelfe and take
thy death patiently. To whom he made this anſwer, I have had
this ſaying in great eſteem all my life long: <hi>Thou ſhalt love the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40423:54"/>
Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy body:</hi> and thus I
have underſtood it, that though any one ſhould pluck out my
heart and rent my body in pieces, yet I ought ever to determine
this with my ſelfe, never to ceaſe to love him. Therefore when
God hath confirmed this in me, ſhould I ceaſe to worſhip him, and
to bring this Prayer to an end which is directed unto him?
Therefore holding on in this his prayer, he never left repeating the
word <hi>Echad,</hi> until his ſoul forſook his body. Then was there a voice
heard in the air ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed art thou, O</hi> Rabbi Akibhah, <hi>becauſe
thy ſoul departed breathing the word</hi> Echad, <hi>now ſhalt thou have an
entrance into life eternal, and ſhalt come into that light of the Garden
of Paradiſe.</hi> Amen. Selah.</p>
               <p>They have alſo another prayer like unto the former, which they
call <hi>Schemon Eſre, i. e. eighteen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Orach chajim nu. 113.</note> becauſe it contains ſo many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
thankſgivings and prayers of praiſe therein. Concerning
the ſanctity and holineſſe of this and the former prayer, the Jews
have written many a large Tract, which I leaving to beſpeak their
own worth, will neither praiſe nor any ways diſgrace. The laſt of
theſe every one repeats twice a day, and he that is their Chaplain
or Reader in the Synogogue doth publickly ſing it by himſelfe two
or three ſeveral times. The Jews eſteem highly of it, hoping that
hereby they ſhall obtain remiſſion of all their ſins. When it is
their will and pleaſure to poure out unto God, they are bound to
do it ſtanding, and with ſuch a poſture, that one foot may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
more upon the ground then the other, in imitation of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
of whom it is written: <hi>And their feet were ſtreight feet.</hi> This
is handled more at large in <hi>Rabbi Alphes</hi> in his firſt Chapter,<note place="margin">Ezek. 1. 7.</note> and
in their <hi>Minhagim,</hi> and in many other books. When they ſay
thoſe words,<note place="margin">Isa. 6. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>holy, holy, holy Lord God of hoſts, the earth is full of
his glory,</hi> being a parcel of the Prayer <hi>Schemon Eſre,</hi> by them
named <hi>Keduſcha (a),</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Orach chajim nu. 125. a Sanctitas.</note> then they caper three times together, leaping
up, as though by this their geſture they did indeavour to become
like unto the Angels, who were the firſt Choriſters that ſung this
Song of praiſe. Others ſay, that becauſe theſe words in the
Prophecy of <hi>Eſay</hi> immediatly follow, <hi>And the poſts of the doors
were ſhaken at the voice of him that ſpake,</hi> it is both meet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient

God to give them peace in what place ſoever they are reſident: if a
Chriſtian chance to be in their preſence with a Crucifix or any other
image repreſentative of a Deity, then ought not the Jew to bow
himſelf, but to lift his heart unto the Lord. The three ſteps which they
go backward, are done in honour to God himſelf, for when any one
departs from ſome great Potentate, he commonly for ſome ſpace
goes backward in his congees, bleſſing his worſhip, honours him by
kiſſing his hand, and the complementall bowing of his whole body:
after the ſame manner, when the Jews depart the preſence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
they go backward and ſalute him face to face, leſt he ſhould
ſay, <hi>My people who have made long prayers unto me, are ſo wearied with

When they are about to depart the Temple or Synagogue, then they
ſpeaking within themſelves, quietly and without the leaſt noiſe, they
ſay a certain Prayer beginning <hi>Alenuleſh abeach:</hi> It is meet that
we ſhould praiſe the Lord, who is above all, and in an excellent degree
to celebrate him, becauſe he hath created all things, and not made us
like unto the reſt of the Nations; likewiſe that he hath not made
us as other generations of the World, and hath not appointed us an
inheritance like unto theirs, neither is our lot as their lot, neither as
the lot of their whole multititude. Here are ſome words omitted in
their Books of Common-prayer, and that by the Commandement of
the Magiſtrates of <hi>Italy,</hi> where their Books are wont to be, and for the
moſt part are at this day imprinted. The things omitted were ſome
blaſphemous ſayings againſt our Saviour, which are found expreſſed
in the ancient copies, of which I have one which was imprinted at <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta</hi>
by a Jewiſh Printer called <hi>Chajim,</hi> in the year of Chriſt 1534. In
other copies, inſtead of the words omitted, there is left an empty ſpace
about the length of one line, to this end, that the children of the Jews,
and others who are ignorant, may be warned to enquire, what ſaying
it is that is there omitted, which when they do, ſome relate the words
unto them, or otherwiſe write them in the margent of the Book, as I
have obſerved them to have practiſed in many of their Prayer books;
the words left out are theſe: <hi>Who bend their knee and crouch to that
which is vanity and fooliſhneſs, and adore another God who cannot help:</hi>
(theſe words they utter againſt Chriſt, wherefore they ſpit upon the
earth in the mouthing of them) <hi>But we bend and bow our knees, yea, our
whole man to that King, who is King of Kings, to God holy and bleſſed for
ever, who ſtretcheth out the heavens, eſtabliſheth the earth, whoſe glory
and chair of eſtate is in heaven and the ſeat of whoſe power is in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
heavens: he only is our God, and there is no other beſides him,</hi> Theſe
things thus finiſhed, the Jew, now going out Of the Synagogue, ſaith,
<hi>O Lord God, lead me by thy juſtice, by reaſon of thoſe that lay wait for me
in ſecret, make plain thy way before my face. Preſerve me in my going
out and my comming in, from this time forth for evermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They muſt go out of the Synagogue in the poſture of a Crab ſiſh,
creeping backward through the Gate thereof, and that their back part
ſhould not be towards the holy Ark, in which the book of the Law is
laid up, to which they ought to exhibit a certain kind of reverence by
turning their face thereunto. The Rabbines upon thoſe words of the
Prophet <hi>Ezekiel, Who have turned their back unto the Temple of the
Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek 8.14.</note> have delivered thus much in the Talmud, that a grievous and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy

puniſhment was inflcted upon the Prieſts, becauſe in going out of
the Temple of the Lord,<note place="margin">In Tract. Joma</note> they turned their back parts towards the ark
of the Covenant, wherefore the case ſtanding thus, we ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
out of the Temple with all fear and reverence, even as a ſervant
being about to take his leave of his Maiſter, doth it with a retrograde
crowching ſubmiſſion, and ſubmiſs lowlineſs. They muſt not run out
of the Synagogue, leſt ſome might think him that runneth to be weary
with praying, and to rejoyce that it is now lawfull for him to depart.
They muſt go out with decurtate ſteps; for if any one doth this, God
numbreth his ſteps, and gives him a great reward,<note place="margin">Job. 14. 16.</note> as it is written:

turn away his face from beholding her, he muſt not afford her the

               <p>Concerning the ſerious manner of praying, they write,<note place="margin">Orach chajim nu. 91. &amp; ſeq</note> that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
wil pray attentively ought to have his head and heart covered, &amp;
to incompaſs his body with a girdle in the middle, leſt his heart by the
ſight of the ſecret part ſhould be inveigled with wicked thoughts. He
muſt turn his face towards <hi>Canaan</hi> and the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> his feet
equally placed upon the Earth, as aboveſaid. He ought to put his
hand upon his heart in that manner, that his right hand may reſt upon
his left, withall bowing his head with great humility: as it is written,

In time of prayer none muſt yawn, belch, or ſpit; yet if he muſt ſpit
on neceſſity, then ought he privately to receive it in his Handkerchiff,

if any ſhould beray with this excrement, he ſhould be guilty of an

Prayer, if he do it againſt his will, then ought he to ſuſpend the act of
praying, until the ill ſavour thereof be gone. If the wind urge him
ſo much and ſo vehemently that he muſt of neceſſity let fly, then ſhall

Sneeſing in time of Prayer, if it come from the parts below, is an ill
ſign, if from above, a good one. He that beginneth once to pray, muſt
not break off in the middle of his Prayer, yea although the King of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
ſhould come and ſalute him, yet he may not anſwer him; though a
Serpent took him by the heel and bit him, yet ought he to continue in
his devotions; yet there is a certain diſpenſation which licenſeth a man
to give way unto a churliſh Oxe, and for fear of him to ceaſe praying
til he be gone and paſt. It is not lawfull for him that prayeth to touch
his naked body with his hands, yet may be touch his hands and neck:
If in this time he be ſo neceſſitated as to ſcratch his body, he muſt do it
upon the garments. He that prays muſt move his whole body hither
and thither, as it is written: <hi>All my bones ſhall ſay, O Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 35. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>who is like
unto thee?</hi> The Chanter alſo of the Synagogue in the time of divine
Service ought to pray, ſtanding in ſome hollow, low, deep place, and
to read the Prayer diſtinctly, and with as loud a voice as he can
poſſible: I have ſeen with mine eys the Reader fall down upon his
knees before the Pulpit, becauſe in that place the earth was level, and
not one place lower then another, and to have ſaid Prayers with as
ſhill a voice as he could have done from an higher ſeat. Theſe Prayers
they pour out of a collected narrow heart, chiefly to this end, that they
may obtain the remiſſion of their ſins, and that according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>David,</hi> ſaying: <hi>Out of the depth have I called unto thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 130.</note> 
                  <hi>O
Lord;</hi> and finally, which is the perfection of all, every one ought to
labour with all his ſtrength to anſwer <hi>Amen,</hi> at the end of every
prayer. Hence it is written in the Booke <hi>Tanchuma,</hi> that
it was the ſaying of <hi>Rabbi Jehuda,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Brundſ. cap 41.</note> that whoſoever ſaith <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
in this world, ſhall bee accounted worthy to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> in the
world to come: hence is that of King <hi>David: Bleſſed be the Lord God
of Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Alas poor Jew, thou haſt never uttered one <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the ſpace of 1631 years.</note> 
                  <hi>Amen, Amen:</hi> By which double <hi>Amen,</hi> he notes unto
us, that one <hi>Amen</hi> is to be ſaid in this world, another in that which is
to come, The wiſeſt among the Jews ſay, that whoſoever ſhall ſay
<hi>Amen</hi> with great attention, ſhall bring to paſs that thereby their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
ſhall appoach with all ſpeed, and ſuddenly be accompliſhed.
How I pray you? when <hi>Amen</hi> is pronounced after the manner that it
ought to be, then God ſhakes his head and ſaith, <hi>Wo unto thoſe children,
who are baniſed from their Fathers Table.</hi> And how much comfort is
it to a Father thus to be praiſed of his children? thereupon God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to think of the deliverance of his people out of their captivity and
that he ought not to do otherwiſe; for though he hath put and exiled
them out of his ſight for their ſins, yet he ſuffers with them, and the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40423:58"/>
grief of his children, vexeth him at the heart: Upon which <hi>Rabbi Juda</hi>
hath this ſimily. Even as a Mother having a Daughter who is immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
and diſobedient, who alſo hath been got with child by ſome or
other, caſts her out of her doors for her unchaſt life, and uſeth much
unmerciful carriage towards her; yet in the hour of child-birth ſhe
ſuffers and laments with her after a wonderful manner: even ſo God
hath ſent us into baniſhment for our ſins, yet having compaſſion he
will redeem us when we ſeriouſly pray unto him.</p>
               <p>It was formerly noted, that they ought every day to run over a whole century
of prayers and thankſgivings, and this they very magiſterially demonſtrate, and
that with great ſubtilty, and after the Cabaliſtical manner: and firſt of all out

did theſe ſkilfull Fiſhers, the Cabaliſts, angle out this expoſition? the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
is: Firſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> inſinuated ſo much unto us by putting an hundred letters
in this very verſe. Secondly, it is demonſtrate by a secret of the <hi>Kabala,</hi> by
which is made a certain tranſpoſition of the Letters, to wit, when the firſt letter
of the <hi>Alphabet</hi> is put in the place of the laſt, and that which is immediatly before
the laſt is put in the place of the ſecond, which kind of change the Cabaliſts cal
<hi>Athbaſch,</hi> that is, when <hi>Thau, Aleph, Beth</hi> and <hi>Schin</hi> are mutually changed one for
another. So by the benefit of this ſecret there come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> two letters in the place of

                     </gap>
                  </hi>
and <hi>Jod,</hi> which in computation make an hundred. Thirdly, it is read in the
Talmud, that <hi>David</hi> appointed theſe hundred prayers at that time, when there
dayly died in Iſrael an hundred men, for which cauſe theſe hundred petitions are
dayly to be repeated.</p>
               <p>This is alſo evidently proved out of thoſe words, which we find thus written in
the ſecond Book of <hi>Samuel. David the ſon of Iſhai ſaith,</hi>

was taken out of the artificial archives of the Jewiſh Theology, into which
no Chriſtian may enter. Many more ſuch ſhal hereafter be produced, which is
the reaſon that I will trouble the Reader with no more in this place, but proceed
to declare the carriage of the Jews at home after their return from the Synagogue.

After the ſame manner might the Rabbines have expounded
thoſe words, <hi>Vehaiah Gnekebh Tiſmegnun,</hi> That the Jewes
being interpreters, they muſt be rendred thus, <hi>There ſhall be
a heale or foot, you ſhall beare it;</hi> and that which followes is
this: Before you ſet your heele or foot out of doors, you ſhall
learn the law by reading ſomething therein, and hearing what
God wils and commands to be done. It is a good work in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to learn the law, and on the contrary, a great ſinne for
any to be negligent in the reading of the ſame. In the time of
the firſt. Temple, the peopl of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> committed many
hainous offences; as, Inceſt and Idolatry, yet the Lord did
only in a manner know theſe and took notice of them, untill
they deſpiſed the law, and would take no more paines to learn
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40423:59"/>
it. Then the Lord baniſhed them out of his ſight, deſtroied
a great number of them, and utterly laid waſte their holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Hereupon the Lord cried out by <hi>Jeremie</hi> the Prophet,<note place="margin">Icr. 9. 12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Who is wiſe to underſtand this? and to whom the mouth of the
Lord hath ſpoken he ſhall declare it. Why doth the Land periſh,
and is burnt up like a wilderneſſe, and none paſſeth thorow? And
the Lord ſaith, becauſe they have for ſaken the law which I ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, and have not obeied my word, neither walked there after.</hi>
Againe,<note place="margin">Deu. 29. 24, 25</note> it is written in the firſt booke of <hi>Moſes, Then ſhall
all nations ſay, wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this land?
how fierce is his great wrath? And they ſhall anſwer, becauſe they
have for ſaken the Covenant of the Lord God of their fathers, which
he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.</hi>
Wherefore a religious Jew must not preſently after his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from morning praier, fall to his daily labour and ſervile
emploiments, but either retire himſelfe to his owne houſe, or
in <hi>Beth Hammedraſch,</hi> or the Schoole dedicated to ſtudy, and
there to read and learne ſomewhat out of the Law, which
may preſſe him forward to the feare of God, and an honeſt life,
and godly converſation with men; that by this meanes that
may come to paſſe which the Prophet <hi>David</hi> makes mention
of,<note place="margin">Psal. 84. 7.</note> ſaying, <hi>They will goe from ſtrength to ſtrength, and unto the
God of Gods appeareth every one of them in Sion.</hi> Which is alſo
very well expounded according to the ſagacity of the Jewes,
in a little book written concerning the feare of God, in theſe
words: They did goe from one ſtudy to another, that they
might by learning underſtand the Law.</p>
               <p>When they are returned unto their owne houſe, then lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſide their phylacteries and precatory fardles, they put
them into a cheſt. Firſt, unlooſing them of the head, then
thoſe of the hand, to the end they may at any time firſt take
and bind on theſe of the hand. Some alſo are accuſtomed to
put off their garment of remembrance, or their fringed Coat,
to which the Ribbands are annexed; yet in my judgement it
were more fitting they ſhould weare it continually, that they
might not forget the commandements of the Lord, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
fulfill his Law. They who are godly carry it all the day
long under a corſelet or cloake, but ſo that the ribbonds may
be ſeen of them, that they may bee terrified from committing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40423:59"/>
ſin. I once ſaw a crabbed Rabbine of a waiward holineſſe,
who was Maſter of the Synagogue, whoſe ribbands hanging
at his fringes, hung ſo low downe, that they did even touch
his feet: For as ſome deſiring not to be forgetfull of any thing
committed to his memory, knits a knot in his girdle, to the
end that he looking thereupon, may call to his remembrance
what he ought to put in execution. So theſe five knotted frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in uſe with the Jewes, are as ſo many memorandums to
warne them to avoid the by-paths of ſin and iniquity. And
hence it comes to paſſe, that all the Jewes are of ſuch a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
converſation, that they fulfill, keep and obſerve every one
of Gods commandements.</p>
               <p>They alſo accounted it very good for the wholſome to eate
ſomething before a man in the morning undertake any buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
For there are ſixty three diſeaſes of the Gall, which
may all be cured by the eating of cruſt, and a mornings draught
of the blood of the grape. Who wants wine, he may drink Ale,
or a cup of cold water, as <hi>Raſchi</hi> is of an opinion, and ſo
ſhall he be fitted to undergo any labour.</p>
               <p>They which are honeſt wives indeed, will in the meane
time make ready for dinner ſome boiled meate,<note place="margin">Brand ſpiegel, cap. 43.</note> that their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
bellies at their return home finding ſuch cleanly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
may not by a long tarrying be occaſioned to a thought
that their throats are cut. In that tract of the Talmud about
the Sabbath, it is ordained that the Jewes ſhould goe to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſome five houres after day-break, which is about eleven
a clock; if any over-ſtay any longer, hee may fall into ſome
diſeaſe, by the vehemence where of he may bee brought upon
his knees; for at that time the body expects and requires its
naturall nouriſhment, which if it have not, then it seeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
its owne members: As a Bore in the time of winter is
wont to doe; for then if it be not poſſible for him to come by
any ſuſtenance, hee by ſucking his owne feete relieves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The wives alſo muſt have an eſpeciall care that they ſerve
in the meate thus cleanly drest in a cleanly manner; as it is
written, <hi>You ſhall not make your ſoules abominable with any
creeping thing that creepeth, neither ſhall you make your ſelves
unclean with them that you ſhould be defiled thereby; for I am
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40423:60"/>
the Lord your God,<note place="margin">Lev. 1. 43, 44.</note> you ſhall therefore ſanctifie your ſelves; and
you ſhall be holy, for I am holy; neither ſhall you defile your ſelves
with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</hi>
This place the profound Rabbines conſtrue in this manner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us: That they being commanded by God, ought to eate
meates artificially cooked, as men, not beaſts are accuſtomed
to doe; and that if any one do not eate ſuch viandes, he pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himſelfe, without fall, becomes unſanctified in the eies of
the Lord. The table is to be ſpread with clean linnen, bread
in whole loaves pure well baked and not burn'd, is to be ſet
thereupon; then Grate muſt be ſaid, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

upon the meat to be received. If the good wives of the houſe
have any pullen, or other cattell which are to be fed and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed,
they ought firſt to ſerve them, before they preſume to

and commanded, grounding upon thoſe words: <hi>I will ſend
graſſe in thy fields for thy cattell, that thou maieſt eat and bèe
full.</hi> For there the Law in the firſt place making mention of
Cattell, gives us to underſtand, that a man ought firſt to
ſhew mercy and care for the ſoule of his beaſt, then to refreſh
himſelfe that in so doing, his meat may be wholſome unto him,
and he by feeding thereupon may be full. In the book called
<hi>Sepher Mitznos Naſchim,</hi> or the booke of womens conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it is regiſtred to be the dutie of women, preſently after
the ending of morning prayer, to fodder their Cattell yea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

life of his beaſt; but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruell.</hi>
Therefore if the good wife of the houſe doe earely feed her
flock, ſhe gaines from thence a name graced with the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of juſt and honeſt. It is read in the ſame place, that it is
good and praiſe-worthy, to breed up young Cattell in the

by their aſpects, ſome misfortune about to happen

then the Lord chiefe Chancel our (ſome Angell is hereby un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood)

Furthermore it is a poſition of the Rabbines, that

               <p>The hands being waſhed, are to be cleanly wiped: Hence
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40423:61"/>
it is recorded in the Talmud, that <hi>Rabbi Ahbahu</hi> was wont
to affirm, that whoſoever eates his bread with wet and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dried
hands, his fact is no lesse hainous, then if he had eaten
that bread, which by the law was accounted uncleane unto
the Iſraelites;<note place="margin">Ezek: 4. 13.</note> as it is written, <hi>So ſhall the children of Iſrael

<hi>lachmam Tame,</hi> which comprehend according to the Hebrew
<hi>Cabbaliſticall</hi> computation, 168. Which number the letters
of theſe three words, <hi>Belo, Niggubh, Jadaiim,</hi> doe likewiſe
ſpecifie; which do ſignify being conſtrued, <hi>without the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

this; <hi>The Iſraelites ſhall eate their bread with unwaſhen hands;</hi>

eates bread with unwaſhen hands,<note place="margin">Tract. Sotah. cap. 1. Prov. 26.</note> commits as grievous
a ſinne as if he had laien with a whore. And this he ſifts out
of thoſe words of <hi>Solomon, For a whoriſh woman, a man ſhall
be brought to a morſell of bread.</hi> This then is so ſlrictly obſerved
of the Jews both before and after meat, that you ſhal not ſind
one amongſt a million, that is forgetfull or negligent in the
performance thereof; yea, so curious are they therein, that
when they waſh, they will not ſuffer a ring to ſtay on their
finger, left ſome filth might be ſheltered under the ſame; and
the obſervation of drawing off the ring is so accurate, that
he who in time of waſhing doth not draw it off, is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as unclean, as if he had not waſhed at all. It is written in
the Talmud, that <hi>Rabbi Akibha</hi> was once for a long time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned

proved to be true, yet <hi>Rabbi Joſe, and Rabbi Juda</hi> ſo lightly
regarded the nomenclation, that they gave him their
cloak-bags to lay up untill the Sabbath was paſt. <hi>Rabbi Meir</hi>
would not doe the ſame, but went and hid his in the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre
of the mans father that kept the Inne. The dead time of
the night being come, the Oſte was warned in a dreame to go
and dig in his fathers grave, where he ſhould find a bag full of
money. When he was up in the morning he told the dreame
to <hi>Rabbi Meir;</hi> who ſaid unto him, that thoſe dreames
which were dreamed on the night going before the Sabbath,
were nothing to be eſteemed: And then departing with great
heed and care, watched the Sepulchre all the Sabbath day, leſt
the dreamer ſhould come and take away his money; which
the Sabbath once ended he took out of the earth againe. Upon
the firſt day of the week the other two did alſo require mine
Oſte to deliver their cloak-bags, who conſtantly affirmed that
he had them not, and ſloutly denyed that they left any with
him. They invite him to the wine Tavern, hoping that by
his friendly usage to regaine their goods. While they were
a drinking, they eſpye ſome peaſe and lentiles ſticking in his
beard; from whence they collected, that without all doubt
he had eaten ſuch kinde of pulſe that morning to breakfaſt,
Whereupon they returning to his wife, required their cloake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bags
of her, telling her that her husband commanded them
to bee reſtored, by the ſame token hee had eaten lentiles in
the morning. The woman knowing it even to bee as they
had ſpoken, preſently made delivery, and they held on their
journey. The good man returning to his house, hearing how
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40423:62"/>
matters were carried, beat his wife so cruelly, that ſhee
ſhortly after departed this life. This ſtory yields us an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

death.</p>
               <p>There is another ſtory in the Talmud concerning a Jew,
who eate ſwines fleſh becauſe he did not waſh his hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſate downe to table: It runs thus. There was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Jewish In-keeper, who received into his houſe, as well
Christians as Jewes: Whensoever any Jewes did turn aſide to
lodge with him, he knew them by the waſhing of their hands
before meales; and therefore he alwaies ſet the fleſh of clean
and choice fatlings before them, even such as in the Law
was commanded and appointed to be eaten. But whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
any Chriſtians came, he ſet ſwines fleſh before them. It
fortuned that upon a time a certaine Jew having more ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
then devotion, came unto his houſe, who ſetting down
at the table forgot to waſh his hands; whence the Oaſte
drawing a profitable argument that hee was a Gentile, ſet
ſwines fleſh before him: The Jewes ſtomack being to far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from his braine, as to enter into conſideration of
what he eate, carried headlong with a hunger ſtarved appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
luſtily invaded with teeth and knife, what was ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, never queſtioning what he crammed his guts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
Well, dinner being ended, and the reckoning ariſing
to a round ſumme, the gueſt queſtions his Hoſt how Beefe
came to be at ſo high a rate: To whom hee anſwered, my
friend, you have hitherto fed upon ſwines fleſh, and have
eaten not a little, which now is very deare. The poore
Jew hearing this became very ſore afraid for the commiſſion
of ſo hainous an offence, and was forced over and above, to
pay an heavy mulct, and undergoe much hard pennance for
this his delinquency. All this happened unto him for the
neglect of waſhing his hands; which may ſerve as a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

               <p>IN the former Chapter it is recorded, that the Maſter of
the family uſeth commonly to waſh the laſt of all; and
that for this reaſon, that he preſently may ſit downe at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and ſay grace, in ſo doing, neither ſpeaking word, nor
doing any other action between the waſhing of his hands and
bleſſing of his meate. This they practiſe, not only that no
evill may befall them in time of their repaſt, but alſo becauſe
their Doctors prove it out of thoſe words of <hi>David; Lift up
your hands unto the Sanctuary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 134. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>and praiſe the Lord.</hi> For from
hence theſe profound Artiſts have learned two things, the
firſt whereof is this: That the hands in time of waſhing, are
to be lifted up on high, leſt the water which is firſt poured
upon, then and thence becomming unclean, ſliding down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſhould pollute the fingers: The ſecond is, that ſo ſoon
as the hands are waſhed and ſanctified, grace ought preſently
to be ſaid, and thanks to be given.</p>
               <p>When they are once ſeated at the table,<note place="margin">Orach. chajim. num. 167. 82. 201.</note> it is required that
ſome fine bread in whole loaves, and ſalt alſo be ſet thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Then the Maſter of the family takes a loafe in his hand
and cuts it not in the middle, but in ſome other part in which
it is pureſt and beſt baked; then inſtantly ſetting it aſide, laies
both his hands upon it, and bleſſeth it in manner and form
following. <hi>Bleſſed be thou O Lord our God, King of the whole
world, who bringeth bread out of the earth.</hi> Then he breaks a
bit of it, and putting it into the ſalt, or into ſome ſort of
ſauce, if there bee any upon the table, preſently eates it,
ſpeaking not a word, for if he doe, he is bound to ſay grace
the ſecond time. The piece which he breaks off is of a good
quantity, leſt he ſhould be accounted for a miſerable niggard,
who deſires to be ſparing, where ſpending is ranked in the
place of a good worke and laudable. It is also required, that
two or three ſhould ſit together at the ſame table, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
every one must ſay grace for himselfe. This finiſhed,
he takes the bread into his hands the ſecond time, and cuts
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40423:63"/>
every one there preſent a ſhive of the ſame, laying it on their
trencher, that every one may feed thereupon.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner alſo he bleſſeth the wine, eſpecially
in thoſe regions where they commonly uſe to drinke it; and
were not only the whole number of ten`, but three or foure
are in company. It is performed in this manner: A cup
brim full of wine being preſented, he takes it firſt into both
his hands, then holds it in the right hand alone; yet if
it bee big and weighty, hee may alſo imploy his left, ſo that
hee place it below the right; This done he liſts it up above
the table a hands breadth, and faſtning his eyes upon it, raiſing
himſelfe a little in way of honour, ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed bee thou O
Lordour God, King of the world, who haſt created the fruit of
the vine.</hi> Here it is alſo provided, that when many ſit not at
the ſame table, every one in particular ought to bleſſe his
owne cup; where Ale or water and honey mixed together,
are wont to be drunk, they uſe the ſame kind of grace. The
richeſt ſort of the Jewes drinkes up the ſanctifyed cup of
wine, though they carouſe their cups of Ale after it. They
uſe not at any time to give ableſſing being about to drinke
water.</p>
               <p>Grace being ended, the Maſter of the family uſeth to repeat
the twenty third Pſalme; after which they fall to luſtily, and
feed deliciouſly, if they have wherewithall.</p>
               <p>He that gives not thankes himſelfe, must ſay Amen to him
that ſupplies the place. Hereupon it is read in the Talmud,
that whoſoever ſaith Amen with an attentive and zealous
minde, he is farre more worthy, and of greater eſteem, then
hee that ſaith grace before or after meat. The Rabbines il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate
this by a ſimile taken from one that writes a letter
in another mans name: For as the letter is then confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and ratified when it is ſealed and ſigned by the
hand of another; ſo they make good and eſtablish the bleſſing
given upon the meate, who ſay Amen at the ending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Salt is ſet upon the table in remembrance of their ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which were wont to be offered in the daies of old; for

               <p>The reaſon why they doe not cut and divide their bread

of their Doctors, that hereby they ſhould offend God;<note place="margin">Psal. 10. 3. <gap reason="foreign">

Germane tongue, for the uſe of women and children; in
which is briefly ſet down the plat-forme, after which their
life ought to bee framed untill the end of their daies. They lay
both their hands upon the bread their fingers being ſtretched
out in remembrance of the ten commandements, which God
gave concerning the graine, whereof the bread is made. Theſe commandements cannot bee conveniently inſerted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

for bread.</hi> The Talmudiſts record that there is a certaine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
ſet a purpoſe to obſerve and take notice of them, who
by their negligence and incogitancy, ſuffer the bread ordained
for their nouriſhment, to fall upon the ground, and to be
trodden under foot, whom for their offence he brings to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.
This Angels name is called <hi>Nabel,</hi> who upon a time
watching a man very narrowly, it was his whole deſire to
make him fall into want and miſery; for the accompliſhment
of which his end, hee hoped that ſome time hee would leave
his bread lying upon the earth, that ſo it might bee trode up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It came to paſſe on a certaine day, that the man ſitting
in the field, did eate breade upon the greene graſſe; which
the Angell ſeeing, confabulates with himſelfe: Now at
length I ſhall have my wiſh; for it is impoſſible for him to
gather up his crums which have fallen among the graſſe, but he
muſt of neceſſity leave them to be trodden under foot. The
man when he had done eating, takes a ſpade, cut away the
graſſe together with the crums, and caſts them both into the
ſea; whence it came to paſſe that the fiſhes came and eat them
up, making a meale of them. Thus were the hopes of the Angell
made fruſtrate, and his voice was heard in the aire, ſaying, woe
unto me, foole that I was, that this man hath drawn me from
my habitation all in vaine, for I can finde no occaſion to puniſh
him.</p>
               <p>In the mean time while any man is eating and chewing his
meate in his mouth,<note place="margin">Tract. Taa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis de jejunio.</note> he ought not to ſpeake, according to the
Talmud, leſt the meat should chance to slide some other way
then into his throat, and be choaked by the meanes thereof:
Although one ſneese at the table,<note place="margin">Orach. chajim num. 170.</note> yet he that eateth ought not
to say God bleſſe you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:40423:65"/>
Theſe wiſe and holy Rabbines write, that <hi>Elias</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
is alwaies preſent at the table, and that every man hath
one peculiar Angell waiting over him, who being a daily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant
at the table, notes with what devotion he gives
thankes, how his words fall from him, and according to what
ſquare he frames his behaviour. If they who are ſet downe to
meate, commune of the things contained in the Law of God,
then the Angell doth not depart from them, and their meate
becomes wholſome unto them; but if they ſpend the time
in fooliſh tales, or ſcurrilous relations, then hee leaves the
roome, and an evill ſpirit and infortunate ſupplies his place;
who, dinner and ſupper being ended, ſtirres up ſtrifes, brawls,
blowes and diſeaſes; ſuch men alſo are not ſatisfied though
they eate abundance; as it is written, <hi>The righteous eateth to
the ſatisfying of his ſoule,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 13. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>but the belly of the wicked ſhall want.</hi>
And becauſe ſuch miniſtring ſpirits, whether good or bad, are
alwaies preſent at the table, thence it comes to paſſe, that no
Jewes will preſume to caſt the bones and finnes of fiſhes upon
one hand or other, or behind his back, leſt hee might touch
and offend theſe inviſible creatures. They doe it also to this
end, that the dogs under the table ſnatching at the bone,
ſhould catch them by the ſhinne. In the ſame kind they never
ſuffer that any knife ſhould lye upon the back with the edge
upward, leſt those angelicall and ſpirituall creatures ſhould
bee hurt thereby. Marrow bones are not to bee knockt
upon a trencher, for hereby the evill and uncleane Spirits
being rouſed up, thinke that the men are gone by the eares
together, and ſo comming into the roome, annoy thoſe they
find preſent: Some ſmailpiece of bread is therefore to be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the receit of the marrow, which is quietly to be picked
out of the bone.</p>
               <p>In ancient times they were wont to waſh between the
eatings of fleſh and fiſh; which at this day they ſeldome
practiſe, onely a reſpect is to be had in the opinion of the
holy ones, that fleſh and fiſh bee not eaten together, but
in a due method one after the other; alwaies provided hee
pick his teeth, eate a piece of bread, take a draught of wine;
hereby making a difference between the fleſh of fowles and
fiſhes.</p>

                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:40423:66"/>
The knife which they uſe to cut fleſh withal they account it
as an hainous offence to cut butter or cheeſe, or any thing
made with milk, therewith. Milk and fleſh may not be ſet

on which this cruſt of bread is usually left, at this day is not
prepared for the ſame end and purpoſe, that it was in Eſaies
dayes; for they when they had eaten and were full, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of giving of thankes, they ſpread a table for the hoaſte of

being all devoured, no benediction keeps any further reſidence

               <p>Before they ſay grace after meat,<note place="margin">Minhagin p. 6.</note> every one takes his knife

               <p>It was a cuſtome in the daies of old, that before giving of

God, they thank him that he gives meate and drinke to them

Prayers are alwaies to bee ſaid in that place where dinner or

praies not in that place where any banquet is celebrated,
ſhall never come unto the grave, becauſe they shall dye
ſuch a death, which is never accompanied with any buriall;
as, hanging, drowning, or ſuch like. There was once a time
when a certaine godly and religious Jew being in the field,
refreſhed and filled with wholſome meates, forgot to give
thankes. When hee had been long abſent from the foreſaid
place, and at length remembring he had offended in not ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grace; having another in his company, he ſaid unto him,
that hee muſt of neceſſity returne to that place where hee had
formerly taken meate, becauſe hee had left a precious toole
there. Which when he had done, and praied, and given thanks,
God ſhewed this miracle.</p>
               <p>He created a golden dove which the Jew had beſtowed on
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40423:68"/>
him, as a reward of his honeſty and piety, in obſerving the
precepts of the Talmud with ſo great diligence. This was a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle

neare unto the Indian mines: For who will be ſo ſtupid, as

                     </gap>

unto the end of the Pſalme. This prayer is in ſo great eſteem
among them, that they write, that whoſoever ſaith it three
times a day, ſhall have his portion in eternall life.</p>
               <p>Then the Chanter riſing up, ſings halfe of that holy prayer,
which they call <hi>Kaddiſch;</hi> after that the whole Synagogue
joines in the repetition of the eighteen laudatory petitions, of
which we made mention in their morning prayer. Which done
and finiſhed, the Chanter comming for his chaire or pulpit,
so called by the Chriſtians, fals downe upon his knees before
the Arke, and leanes his head upon his left hand, which all
the people doe likewiſe, and bowing their head towards the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40423:69"/>
left ſide, and covering theirface, with their whole heart (for
the heart lies upon the left ſide, and so the head and heart
are joined in ſuch a poſition) they in a moſt devout man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
pronounce the words following: <hi>O mercifull and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
GOD,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 6.</note>

O Lord, in thy fury, neither chaſten mee in thy heavy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi>
They moreover repeate the ſixt Pſalme from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to the end, with their heads covered and bended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the earth.</p>
               <p>The Chanter fals downe upon his knees before the Arke,<note place="margin">Ioſ. 7. 6.</note> in

               </p>
               <p>The reaſon why they cover their faces, is this: In ancient

thither to confeſſe their ſins, every one ſtood from another by

               <p>They leane their head upon their left hand, moved hereunto
by that which is written: <hi>His left hand is under my head,</hi>

                  <hi>and
his right hand doth embrace me.</hi> And moreover, becauſe Iſaac
being about to bee ſacrificed, lay upon his left ſide. But to
returne to the point in hand. They ſuddenly riſe up againe,
and their Chanter ſaies, Wee are ignorant, O Lord, what
other thing to put in practiſe, but only to lift up our eyes
unto thee; as though they would say, Wee have worſhipped
thee O God, ſitting and ſtanding being humble and lifted up,
kneeling, and with anerected poſture; not knowing what

eies unto thee.</p>
               <p>Hitherto they only have ſung their prayer called <hi>Kaddiſch,</hi>
which finiſhed, their evening prayer is ended.</p>
               <p>Now indeed it were very laudable, if after this evening
ſacrifice of prayer and thankſgiving, returning to their owne
houſes, they did immediately fall to ſupper; and that ended,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40423:70"/>
againe to aſſemble themſelves into the Synagogue, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of their nocturnall devotions. But this practiſe is
diſapproved by the Rabbines, as a thing very inconvenient,
ſeeing many may be drunke, and ſo forget their duty of prayer;
therefore they have decreed, that preſently after the evening
prayer be ended, that accuſtomed, to be ſaid in the beginning of
the night, ſhould alſo be finiſhed. Yet not withſtanding, they
make ſome ſmall ſtay between <hi>Minhah and Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rib,</hi> that is to
ſay, between their evening and nightly prayers, to the end the
one may be differenced from the other.</p>
               <p>They have one quaint cuſtome concerning the reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them that are at ſtrife one with another, and that in
time of prayers. For if two be at ods, and the one cannot bring
the other with him into the Synagogue: That a reconcilemet
may be made, he ſteps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto the book, out of which the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſings or ſaies their common prayers, ſhuts it, and giving
it a clap with his hand, ſaith, <hi>I conclude and put a period to this
exerciſe;</hi> which is all one as if he ſhould ſay, I locke and ſeale
up this order of praying, interdicting the ſame, untill an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
be made between me and mine adverſary. And from
that time forward, untill his deſire bee accompliſhed, it is
not lawfull for them to ſay any more prayers in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue.
Thence it often fals out, that they retune home with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any praying; yet if the one party bee wayward and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory,
there happens many times a ſurceaſe and intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this duty of prayer, for ſome whole dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Among many others, they have a prayer, that God would
vouchſafe to deliver them from the Chriſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bring them
back againe to their owne land: This prayer begins, <hi>Baruch
Jehovah,</hi> O bleſſed God our Lord, help us, gather together
and deliver us from the Gentiles, that we profeſſing thy holy
Name, may make our boaſt of thy praiſe. All the people which
thou haſt created ſhall come and worſhip thee, fall down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee, and ſing praiſes unto thy name. Our eyes ſhall see it,
our heart ſhall rejoice, our ſoul ſhall be joyfull in thy ſtrength,
when it ſhall be ſaid in <hi>Sion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> The Lord doth reign, God is King,
he doth rule, and ſhall beare rule for evermore; for thine is thy
Kingdome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:40423:70"/>
But alas poore ſilly Jew, in vaine thou gapeſt after (with
a greedy expectation) this thy rejoicing, ſeeing he is come ſome
ſixteen hundred years agoe, whom thou as yet waites for, and
expects to bring thee joy and conſolation.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, they ſay one petition more, formerly mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in their morning prayer; in which, they entreat God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
their cauſe againſt all the Chriſtians in generall; but in
a more eſpeciall manner, againſt their Magiſtrates. If any lost a
father in that yeare, he is tied all the yeare long to ſay that prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
called <hi>Kaddiſch</hi> the leſſe, by the mediation of which, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall be delivered out of purgatory; of which (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling)
more hereafter.</p>
               <p>When they go out of the Synagogue, then muſt they repeat
thoſe ſentences formerly mentioned in the fifth Chapter.<note place="margin">Tal. &amp; R. Alphes. Tract Bera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chos. c. 1.</note> And
in this place againe they exerciſe many prolix diſputes about
that prayer, beginning, <hi>Schema Iſrael, Heare O Iſrael, the
Lord thy God is one God,</hi> queſtioning the manner how, the

and repeated. All which to avoid prolixity, I willingly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
               <p>At dinner and ſupper their carriage is the ſame.<note place="margin">Orach. chajim num. 235.</note> When they
goe to bed, they muſt firſt draw off the left foot ſhooe, then
the right. They put off their ſhirts lying in bed, and covered

behold their unſeemly nakedneſſe. And this is the cauſe that
they never uſe to empty their bladder in their bed-chamber,
their clothes being off, the very act becomming a ſhamefull
diſgrace unto them, and the conſequent of ſuch impudence,
being a fearfullapse into an extream poverty; a conſideration

               <head type="sub">How the Jewes doe ceaſe from their labours every Munday and
Thurſday.</head>
               <p>IT is regiſtred in the Talmud,<note place="margin">Tract. Rabhae Kama. cap. 7.</note> as alſo in the writings of <hi>Rabbi
Alphes,</hi> that <hi>Ezra</hi> the Prophet did command the Jewes
in that time when they were in captivity at <hi>Babylon,</hi> to obſerve
theſe ten things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that upon the Sabbath day;</p>
               <p>Secondly, that upon every Munday and Thurſday in every
week they ſhould repaire to the Synagogue, and read ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Chapters or Sections out of the booke of the law, and
that publikely, ſome peculiar Ceremonies, and a more then
vulgar holineſſe being conjoyned with the practiſe of the
ſame.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that upon every Munday and Tueſday they ſhould
ſit in judgment, deciding the cauſes betwixt man and man, that
according to the rule of juſtice, every one may have his
owne.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that upon Thurſday they ſhould waſh all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
clothes and veſſels, ſweepe the houſe, and make every
corner thereof very handſome, in honour of the holy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, that every Thurſday the men ſhould eat leekes.</p>
               <p>Sixthly that the women riſing early in the morning, ſhould
bake their bread, to the end that they may have in readineſſe a
morſell to relieve the poor when he commeth to their doore.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:40423:72"/>
Seventhly, that the women ſhould weare a vaile or maske
for modeſties ſake.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, that the women entring into the bath, ought to
combe their haire in an accurate manner, even ſo that one hair
may be parted from another.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, that it ſhall bee lawfull for all Chapmen and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
travelling from Faire to Faire to ſell their wares;
that by this meanes the women may furniſh themſelves with
all things of fragrant ſmell, and gay attire, both for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
celebration of the Sabbath, and for the pleaſing of their
husbands.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that thoſe who were troubled in the night time
with the efflux of ſeed out of their genitals, and ſo became
uncleane, ſhould purge themſelves by waſhing.</p>
               <p>Hence it appeares, that although the Prophets who were
before <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time, did inſtitute and ordaine, that the
people ſhould every Sabbath day, be taught out of the Law of
<hi>Moſes;</hi> yet was it meet that <hi>Ezra</hi> (to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ite and prick Iſrael for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to a higher degree of godlineſſe) ſhould enact it for a
perpetuall decree, that three daies, in any weeke, ſhould not
paſſe but in one of them ſome thing ſhould be rehearſed out of
the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by which the people being auditors, might
receive inſtruction. This Edict of <hi>Ezra,</hi> his learned ſuccessors
did teach and expound, and alſo ratifie and confirme out of
thoſe words in <hi>Exodus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 15. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>They went out into the wilderneſſe of
Sur, and they went three daies and found no water.</hi> By water in
this place, underſtanding the Law, becauſe it is called by the
name of water by the Prophet,<note place="margin">Iſaiah 55. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Hoe every one that thirſteth,
come yee to the waters, and he that hath no money, come yee, buy
and eate, yea, come, buy wine and milke without money and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
price;</hi> that is to ſay, Come ye unto the Law and word
of God. Without which when they had walked three dayes
in the deſart, they divided the weeke in such a manner, that
once in three dayes they ought alwaies to heare and learne
ſomewhat out of the law. This cuſtome is alſo practiſed upon
Mundayes and Thurſdayes in remembrance of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Thurſdaies went up into Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> brought from thence
the two Tables of the Law made of Cedar; intreated a pardon
for the ſinne of the Jewes in making the golden calfe; and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40423:72"/>
upon Munday came downe from the Mount againe. Hereupon
alſo thoſe which are moſt puritanically ſtraight-laced among
the Jewes at this day uſe to fast upon Mundayes and Fridayes;
as that Phariſee did in the time of our Saviour, boaſting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in this ſupercilious manner, <hi>I give thee thanks O God, that I
am not as other men are, extortioners, unjuſt, adulterers, nor as
this Publican; I faſt twice a weeke, and pay tithes of all that I
have.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is neceſſary that upon theſe daies a ſingular care
be had of hearing and meditating the word of God, in reſpect
that they are dayes appointed for judicature. Hence alſo it is,
that the halfe of them to this very day are feſtivall among the
Jewes: For in the mornings of them, they repaire very timely
unto the Synagogue, where beſides their ordinary prayers, they
ſing or ſay many other which are extant in their Minhagin,
and their manuals of prayer. Moreover, they are wont to
boaſt in a very ſwaggering ſtile of their taking out and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the booke of the Law into the Arke; of which more
anon.</p>
               <p>Concerning their uſuall prayers upon theſe dayes, they add
one more then ordinary to thoſe in the morning, beginning,
<hi>Vehu racham,</hi> to which they attribute great vertue and ſtrange
operations; hidden ones ſurely, for they have not made their
appearance for one thouſand ſix hundred and odd yeares. This
they uſe to ſay ſtanding, and that with great devotion. There is
a certaine ſtory very pat to this purpoſe. When the Jewes
were baniſhed out of Jeruſalem by <hi>Titus Veſpaſian</hi> the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Emperour: The Emperour commanded that three ſhips
filled with Jewes, ſhould be ſet to float upon the ſea, having
neither maſt nor ſailes. This his command being put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the ſhips being toſt with a moſt violent tempeſt, were
parted aſunder, and caſt upon the ſhore of three divers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
the names whereof, were <hi>Lovanda, Arlado,</hi> and <hi>Burdeli,</hi>
which are now worne out of remembrance. All the Jewes in
one of thoſe ſhips, were very courteouſly entertained by the
Lord of that country in which they landed, who in a moſt
bountifull manner gave them land to till, and Vineyards. After
his death, there aroſe another King, who handled and vexed
the Jewes moſt inhumanely, even as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40423:73"/>
ſaying unto them, that he would try whether they
were true Jewes or not after the ſame manner that <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>
tryed <hi>Hananias, Miſael,</hi> and <hi>Azarias,</hi> and if you can
walke without hurt in the middle of the fiery furnace, as they
did, then will I confeſſe that you are true Jewes indeed. To
whom the Jewes made anſwer, entreating him that he would
doe unto them, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did to the three for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
which was, to grant them three dayes reſpite, that they
might pray unto God to deliver them. Which when he had
granted, two brothers called <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and their
Couzen <hi>Samuel,</hi> came together to conſult what was beſt to
be done, who determined neither to eat or drinke for three
dayes together. Which while they put in practiſe, every one
having a ſeverall prayer, which they joined in one, and repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it without intermiſſion night and day, untill their allotted
time was ended. In the morning of the third day, one of them
ſaid he had dreamed that he heard one read a verſe out of the
Bible, in which <hi>Kt</hi> was twice, and <hi>Lo</hi> three times reiterated;
but what it meant, or where it was, he was altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
Then anſwered one of the other two, and ſaid, this verſe
will be a helpe and comfort unto thee; for hereby is ſignified,
that God will ſend thee help from heaven; and it is written
in the forty third chapter of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and the ſecond verſe, the
words wherof are theſe; <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, when thou paſſeſt through the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
I will be with thee, and through the rivers they ſhall</hi> Lo, <hi>not
overflow thee.</hi> Ki, <hi>when thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt</hi>
Lo, <hi>not bee burnt,</hi> Lo <hi>neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee.</hi>
Upon the third day a huge fire was provided earely in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
an immenſe number of people flocking to the execution,
who were very deſirous to be preſent at the burning. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
being compleate, theſe three men did commend their
bodies to the mercy of the fire ſinging and praying untill all
the wood being conſumed, they came out of the fire without
the leaſt touch thereof.</p>
               <p>This miracle the foreſaid men divulged in what place ſoever
they came; whereupon it was ordained and commanded that
this prayer ſhould bee said every Munday and Thursday mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in every Synagogue, and place of publike prayer; which
the Jewes obſerve and keepe unto this very day, hoping, that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40423:73"/>
by the power of this prayer, they ſhall be delivered from their
long continued captivity, and tedious exile. But alas, their
hopes will be fruſtrate, ſo long as they deſpiſe and ſet at nought
the Saviour of their ſoules. Chriſt Jeſus, and perſevere in their
horrible ſuperſtition. This Fable is here related more at
large, then it is by <hi>Antonius Margarita</hi> out of the booke
<hi>Colbo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The prayer beginning <hi>Vehu racham,</hi> ſo much eſteemed of
them, is written in the forme following, <hi>He is mercifull, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
iniquity, and not deſtroying the ſinner. He oftentimes turns
his anger from us, and ſuffers not his fury to ariſe. O God I beſeech
thee take not thy mercy from me, let thy meekneſſe and truth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
preſerve me. Help us O God, our God, and gather us from
among the Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c. In briefe, the ſum of this prayer is
this: They beg of God that hee would vouchſafe to pardon
their ſinnes, take pity upon the deſolations of their City
and Temple, to gather them from the foure corners of the
earth, and never ſuffer his inheritance to bee aſhamed. In
this prayer they are alſo mindefull of us Chriſtians, againſt
whom they thus petition, <hi>O God, how long ſhall thy ſtrength re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in captivity; and thy beauty in thy enemies hand? O Lord
God, ſtirre up thy ſtrength, and revenge us upon all our enemies,
ſo ſhall their might be turned into weakneſſe, and they ſhall be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and periſh.</hi> Theſe laſt words are in many Copies left out,
by reaſon of an injunction laide upon the Printers by the
Chriſtian Magiſtrate, an empty ſpace being left, that they
may either write them, or e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe inquire what is wanting.
Theſe things thus finiſhed, they fall the ſecond time upon
their faces, and ſaying many other prayers (as was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the former Chapter;) they beſeech God that hee would
remove his anger farre from them, and not deliver them
into the hands of their enemies, but being mindefull of the
Covenant that hee made with their fathers, would make
their ſeed like unto the ſtarres of Heaven for multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>After that they have for ſuch a ſpace, either kneeling or ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
poured out their ſouls in prayer unto God; then followes
the narration of that pompe and ſtate which they exhibite to
the booke of the Law; they reade weekly Lectures out of it,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40423:74"/>
according as they were enjoyned by <hi>Ezra</hi> the ſcribe: The
manner followeth. In every Synagogue they have the booke
of the Law, to wit, the Pentateuch, written in long ſchroles
of parchment ſewed together; at the ends thereof are faſtned
certaine pieces of wood, for the ſafer keeping, and more eaſie
carriage of the booke of the Law.</p>
               <p>This book is kept in a certaine Arke or Cheſt, ſtanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
againſt ſome wall of the Synagogue. Before the Ark
is a little doore, and before it a hanging made by the Art
of the embroiderer. This is of divers ſorts, and the more
ſolemnn the feſtivall is, the richer are the hangings: Thoſe
are had in greateſt eſteeme with them, whoſe outſide is ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and wrought with the ſhapes of divers birds; for ſuch
were alwaies an ornament upon the old Arke of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>The booke is alwaies wrapt up in a linnen cloth; in which
are characteriſed ſome Hebrew words, and divers names. That
which is the moſt outward of all, is oftentimes a linnen cloth
much like unto a little coat or cloake made of ſilke, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of puregold, upon which they hang ſome ſilver plates
faſtned to a golden chaine, in which is written<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Kether thorah,</hi>
that is to ſay, the crowne of the Law; or <hi>Kodeſch adonai,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
to the Lord. Then the ſexton goes about and cries, who
will buy <hi>Gelilah etz chajim?</hi> which is a certaine kinde of office,
which any ſupplying, is licenced to toſſe over the booke of
the Law by a ſerious reviſall: Which office is granted unto
him who will give the moſt money for it, which is put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the poore mans box, and cheſted up for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.</p>
               <p>Thoſe pieces of wood, by the helpe whereof the booke of
the Law is carryed up and downe, are called by them <hi>etz

or Chanter laies down the book of the Law: Then comes he
who is to purchaſe the Office of <hi>Gelilah</hi> with his money, taking

which finiſhed, the <hi>Chaſan,</hi> and the other who was to

commanding his perſonall appearance in his fathers name, and
his own; he approaching the preſence, ſeats himſelfe in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
kiſſes the book, not upon the bare leaves of the ſame, for
this were an hainous offence, but through the ſwadling cloutes
thereof; and graſping the cover thereof, ſaies with a loud voice;

himſelfe that his lot is fallen unto him in a fair ground,
ſeeing he hath ſeen and handled the tree of life, and therefore

               <p>In the next place the miniſter reades a chapter or ſection out

After this, two more are ſucceſſively called, whoſe beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour

praiſe the name of the Lord; for the name of this our God, is
of great power and ſtrength. The congregation anſwereth and
ſaith; His praiſe is above heaven and earth; he hath exalted
the horne of his peculiar people, to the praiſe of all his ſaints:
Yea, the Iſraelites being a folke moſt neare unto him, praiſe yee
the Lord. When the book is laid in the Arke, the people ſay

ſhall keep my going out, and comming in, from this time forth for

               <head type="sub">The preparation of the Jewes to the Sabbath, and how they begin
the ſame.</head>
               <p>IT is written in the ſecond booke of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 16. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>That upon the
ſixt day they gathered twice as much bread;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe 23.</note> and a little after,
<hi>this is that which the Lord hath ſaid, To morrow is the reſt of
the holy Sabbath unto the Lord, bake that which you will bake to
day, and ſeeth that yee will ſeeth, and that which remaineth over,
lay up for you to bee kept untill the morning.</hi> Theſe words force
the Jewes to this concluſion, that it is their duty, and Gods
command too, that they ſhould provide all things neceſſary,
pertaining to the honourable celebration of the Sabbath; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
dainty and delicate meates, which they ought to boile
or bake betimes upon the Friday morning, whereon they may
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40423:76"/>
feed upon the Sabbath, and with more facility, reſt from their
labours. The women are in a more particular manner enjoined
to prepare great ſtore of palate pleaſing wafers; who while
they are kneading and making ready the dough, they are very
ceremoniall therein, leaving the lump whole. If the bigneſel
cauſe a neceſſity of diviſion, which is often ſeen in great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
then the one part thereof is covered with a cloth, that
it may not be aſhamed, and put an open ſcandall by the other
part, in that it is provided in the laſt place, for the Sabbaths re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt.</p>
               <p>They honour the Sabbath with three banquets, all ſerved in
much pompe. The firſt whereof they celebrate upon Friday
at night, when the Sabbath begins. The ſecond upon the day it
ſelſe about twelve of the clock. The third and laſt upon the
evening of the ſame. Theſe to be the due times, they prove
out of thoſe words of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 16. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Eat that to day, for to day it is a
Sabbath unto the Lord; to day yee ſhall not find it in the field.</hi>
From the word <hi>to day,</hi> thrice repeated, the Rabbines conclude,
that <hi>Moſes</hi> in this place doth ſignif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, that manna ought to be
eaten at three ſeverall times upon the Sabbath, orderly ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
one another. This inſtitution according to the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
in their Dutch <hi>Minhagin,</hi> is profitable in another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect:
That is, if only one banquet ſhould be provided, every
one would with ſuch gredineſſe feed thereupon, that his guts
ſhould be ſufficiently ſtuft for the reſt of the enſuing time, even
untill the end of the Sabbath. But now, ſeeing that every man
knowes that one banquet being ended, two more are to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
his ſtomack hath no ſuch edge to the firſt, as otherwiſe
it had, but living in a very temperate manner he eats his meat
with pleaſure, conſcious of a ſecond and third returne to the
table. What other Rites they practiſe ſhall hereafter be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted.</p>
               <p>In the time of preparation, no man muſt thinke it a thing
unſeemly, or derogating from his birth or riches, to worke
with his owne hands, that the preparation to the Sabbath,
may be compleat. And although ſome one man there were,
who had an hundred thouſand men and maides, yet ought not
to be a meere overſeer of their labours, but a partaker, and
that in honour of the Sabbath. According to that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40423:76"/>
in the Talmud, that the good and honeſt man <hi>Rabbe
Chaſda,</hi> would fall a chopping pot-herbes: Thoſe learned men,
<hi>Rabba,</hi> and <hi>Rabbi Joſeph,</hi> would cleave wood: <hi>Rabbi Ezra,</hi>
would make the fire; <hi>Rabbi Nachman</hi> would ſweep the houſe,
and would moreover provide all manner of inſtruments ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the table. Meates either boiled or roaſted are kept
hot in an oven, becauſe they are better hot then cold. The
tableſtands covered all the day and night long, which hath
a myſticall ſignification; as hereafter ſhall bee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, they waſh their heads, and uſe the help of
a barber if need require. The women ought to attire their
heads, and plate their haire, to goe into ſome hot bath, or
elſe to waſh their hands in hot water. Upon every Friday
they pare their nailes, and in a very ſuperſtitious faſhion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
at the fourth finger of the left hand, and ſo holding
on to the ſecond, then to the fift, then to the third, and laſt of
all to the thumbe; whence it comes to paſſe, that they cut not
their nailes in order, but ſtill over-skip ſome finger or other.
In cutting thoſe of the right hand, they begin with the ſecond
finger, and ſo hold on to the fourth. He that throwes his nailes,
being cut off, upon the ground, that they may bee trodden
under foot of men, is a wicked man, and a great ſinner. For
Satan hath power over the nailes, and wizards by the help of
them, exerciſe their inchantments; and if any chance to tread
upon them, ſome great danger or other hangs over his head. On
the contrary, whoſoever digs and buries them in the earth, he
is accounted for an honeſt righteous man. If he caſt them into
the fire, then is hee a holy and honourable man in eſteeme.
And the truth of every particular, they evidently demonſtrate
in their owne opinion, out of the words formerly alledged;
the ſumme of which were, that upon the ſixt day, they ſhould
prepare themſelves. Moreover, it is neceſſarily required,
that every one ſhould ſharp his knife, uſe the whetſtone, and
edge him acutely,<note place="margin">Iob 5 24, 25.</note> which they prove by thoſe words; <hi>Thou
ſhalt know that thy tabernacle ſhall be in peace, thou ſhalt viſit thy
habitation, and ſhalt not ſinne. Thou ſhalt know alſo that thy ſeed
ſhall be great, and thy off-ſpring as the graſſe of the earth.</hi> Out
of which ſaying the Jewiſh Doctors have drawne this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40423:77"/>
that whereſoever is a blunt knife, and nothing cunning
in cutting there is no peace at the table, and the whole houſe
is out of ſquare.</p>
               <p>In the next place they put on their holiday clothes,<note place="margin">Orach. chajim num. 262.</note> every
one dreſſing himſelfe in the moſt minicall faſhion, his plodding
curioſity can invent. They of the richer ſort, have garments
onely appropriated to the day, not kiſſing their corpes upon
any other, and their reaſon for the ſame is very plauſible; for
the Rabbines call the Sabbath a Queen: Now if any being to
make his appearance before this Queene, ſhould not put on
ſome princely garments, ſuch as in other place; they uſe to
weare in the preſence of a King, then this Queen ſhould bee
much ſcandalized thereby.</p>
               <p>They cover the table with fine and cleane linnen, not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
the proviſion of napkins, trenchers, cups, cuſhions,
ſtooles, and other appurtenances, that all things may bee in a
readineſſe to entertaine this renowned Queen, the Sabbath, in
a fit and decent manner.</p>
               <p>In the daies of old,<note place="margin">Orach. chajim. num. 256.</note> warning to a due preparation was wont
to be given by the ſound of an horne or trumpet. But at this
day the Sexton or keeper of the Synagogue, goes about to
every houſe, making proclamation that every man ſhould ceaſe
from labour, and prepare himſelfe to a comely and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
welcomming of the holy Sabbath, which comes to his
houſe much like to ſome beautifull ſpouſe. Therefore eventide
once come, they reſt from all domeſtique employments, and
early give the Sabbath a laudable beginning, adding nothing
of the week thereunto; but going into the Synagogue, are
converſant in prayer, in the ſinging of pſalmes and hymnes and
ſpirituall ſongs, according to their wonted manner.</p>
               <p>While the day takes it leave with a ruddy countenance,
bluſhing that the night ſhould diſplace it, and the ſplendent
rayes of the Sun onely gild the tops of trees and mountains,
the women light their ſabbaticall tapers.</p>
               <p>The lampes they uſe, are made of Copper, and they hang
them up in the dining room, whoſe matches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo ſoon as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to burn, the miſtriſſe of the houſe ſtretching out her hands,
towards the lights, ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed be thou, O God, our God King of
the world,</hi> who haſt ſanctifyed us by thy commandments, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40423:77"/>
commanded us to light the lampes appointed for the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sabbath. When the ſeaſon is cloudy, the hens ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the place of a clock unto the woman. For they flying up
to take their lodging, are a certaine ſigne, that the time wherein
the Sabbath ought to begin, drawes neare. If there be no hens
in the Towne, then the Crow and Nightingale taking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
their place of reſt give her notice of the approach. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are enjoyned the performance of this office, rather
then men; for two reaſons which are urged by the Rabbines.
The firſt is, becauſe ſo ſoon as our old Grandam <hi>Eve</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that ſhee by eating of the forbidden fruit was lyable to
dye the death, ſhee alſo deſired that good <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould taſte
of the ſame; ſaying, if I muſt dye, indeed it is fit and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
that thou ſhouldſt dye with me. Hereupon being very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
with him to eat, which he refuſing, ſhee breakes
a club from off the tree, never ceaſing therewith, to bang his
hide, untill ſhee forced him whether he would or not, to take
the apple and eate it,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 12.</note> as the Text ſaith, <hi>Shee gave me of the
tree, and I did eate,</hi> that is to ſay, ſhee gave mee many ſound
blowes with her baſtinado which ſhee broke from the tree,
and ſo cauſed me to eate. This gloſſe is in <hi>Orach chajim,</hi> and
the ſecond Chapter.</p>
               <p>Thus the mad foole <hi>Adam</hi> ſuffered his wife to weare the
breeches to beate and ſeduce him, and by this meanes tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing
the Lords commandement, brought death upon him,
and all his poſterity.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Sun ſhall ſhine in the ſame degree of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
luſtre to the immortall eies of the juſt, in the world to
come, that ſhined unto <hi>Eve</hi> before ſhee had ſinned; for ſo
ſoone as ſhee had committed ſinne, the Sun changed his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
light, clouding it in obſcurity, ſo that <hi>Eves</hi> black of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
became a vaile unto that glorious light of the whole
univerſe.</p>
               <p>A ſecond reaſon for which the women are to light lampes
in their houſes, is, becauſe they are alwaies reſident at home;
but their husbands are often abroad, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

put out the light of life which was in the world, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
thereof, ſhee is bound in the evening of every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath

her repentance, as willing to revive and re-enlighten the ſoule
of man, which compared to the lampe by the wiſeſt of men,

all the inward parts of the belly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Jewiſh Doctors have likewiſe written, that if any
woman light thoſe lamps with a devout mind, attending well
what ſhee is about, her worke is as worthy to be had in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
as if ſhe had lighted that golden lamp which was once in
the holy Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is alſo recorded in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> that the women dye in
child-bed for a three-fold ſinne and offence. Firſt, for their
forgetfulneſſe to take the lumpe<note n="a" place="margin">This lump in old time, was made with oile; concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which you may read, Exod 29. 23. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> which ſignifies a burning or inflamation. All which
thoſe women that performe, and diligently put in execution,
the foreſaid commandements do eaſily eſcape.</p>
               <p>The lampes ought to be two in number, or moe, according
to the quality and condition of the houſe, wherein they are
lighted. Theſe repreſent all the members of mans body, as well
of the male as female. For the man hath two hundred forty
eight, but the woman two hundred fifty two, according to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40423:78"/>
the Jewiſh anatomy. Theſe two numbers being conjoyned,
make up five hundred, and ſo many containes the Hebrew
word, <hi>Ner,</hi> which ſignifies a lampe, being twice written,
once for the man, and once for the woman. The words, <hi>Ner,
Ner,</hi> ſignifie lampes, not <hi>Narra,</hi> fooles, and the reaſon is,
becauſe the lampe of life ſhall once more bee kindled both in
man and woman.</p>
               <p>When the lampes begin to burne, ſhe ſtretcheth forth both
her hands towards them, to this end, that her action may
be as an ingenious confeſſion, that ſhee is obnoxious to a
crime, in that ſhe ſhould have prayed before the lighting of
the lampes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but becauſe ſhe could not doe it unleſſe ſhe would
have ſpent her breath to no purpoſe, therefore ſhee ſpreads
forth her hands before the lamps, hindering their lighting to

ſplendor, ſhould ſeem not much ſuperiour to them,
which ſend out none at all: So much for the lamps. Of what
matter their matches are made, and with what oile they are to
be fed, here to declare would be a task too tedious. He that
deſires to know, let him read that tract in the Talmud, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Sabbath, where theſe two things are ſufficiently hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
Wee proceed.</p>
               <p>That they begin the Sabbath betimes, the reaſon is, the pity
and commiſeration they have towards the ſoules which are
tormented either in hell or purgatory, but have alwaies a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
in the time of the Sabbath for the celebration thereof.
For ſo ſoone as they are entred the Synagogue, and ſung that
prayer, beginning, <hi>Berachu,</hi> in a ſoule raviſhing delightfull,
and harmonicall note, then hell breaks looſe, and the gates of
purgatory flie open, the ſoules in both leape out into the
earth, and run into every river, fountaine, or any other water
they can come by, deſiring for a time to coole their ſcorched
ſubſtance; and this is the cauſe why the Rabbines moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
commanded, that none ſhould dare to draw any well
dry upon the Sabbath day, leſt these poore and miſerable ſoules
ſhould be utterly deſtitute of ſuch a refreſhing; as we may read
in their <hi>Minhagin.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the meane time that they are a praying in the Synagogue,
there come two Angels, the one good, the other evill, who
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40423:79"/>
ſtanding before the door of the Synagogue, and hearing any
pray diligently,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> and alſo reade attentively that Scripture, <hi>Thus
were the heavens and earth finiſhed and all the hoſte of them;</hi>
and what followes concerning the ſanctifying of the Sabbath:
They bring him to his owne home, and putting their hands
upon his head,<note place="margin">Iſaiah 6. 7.</note> ſay, <hi>Loe, this coale hath touched thy lips,
and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy ſin purged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rabbi Joſe</hi> ſaith in the name of <hi>Rabbi Juda,</hi> that theſe two
Angels bring every man to his home when hee returnes from
the Synagogue. And if theſe Angels entering the houſe of any
Jew, finde the Sabbath lampes burne cleare, the table cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and furniſhed with all neceſſaries, the bed neatly made;
then ſaies the good Angell, It is the pleaſure of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that theſe things ſhould be in the ſame state, the next Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day, that I have now found them in; To which the evill
Angell is forced to ſay, Amen. But if they finde all things
out of order then the evill Angell ſaith, theſe things ſhall be
in the ſame manner, the next Sabbath, to which the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
ſore againſt his will, muſt ſay Amen likewiſe.</p>
               <p>When they are departed the Synagogue, and every man
returned to his owne houſe,<note place="margin">Exod. 20. 8. Minhag. p. 9.</note> then one ſaying unto another,
<hi>God ſend you an happy Sabbath,</hi> they inſtantly fal aboard; for it is
written,<note place="margin">Orach. chajim. num. 269.</note> 
                  <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to ſanctifie it;</hi> which laſt
word is in the Hebrew, <hi>lekadeſcho;</hi> by reaſon of which they
give this gloſſe upon the Text. So ſoon as the Sabbath is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
remember that thou alſo have thy <hi>Kaddaſch</hi> in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
that is to ſay, remember ſolemnly to imitate the ſame

Synagogues, preſently after the ending of evening prayer, a
bowle of wine is ready prepared, becauſe ſome ſtrangers or
poor people which have no wine at home, may bee there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
This being conſecrated, is reached forth unto them unto
the end, that may celebrate the beginning of the Sabbath
in that very place. Whoſoever hee be in the Synagogue that
bleſſeth the wine, he taſtes it not, but gives it to ſome young
boy to drinke thereof; for he is not accuſtomed to drinke of
the ſame, unleſſe it be at home at his own table, where alſo he

                  <hi>The ſixth day the heaven and earth were
finiſhed, and all the hoſt of them. And on the ſeventh day, God
ended his worke which he had made. And he reſted on the ſeventh
day from all his worke which he had made. And God bleſſed the
ſeventh day and ſanctified it; becauſe in it he had reſted from all
his worke which he had made.</hi> Here in the mean time he inſerts
an admonition, ſaying, O my Lords you Rabbines, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
unto the prayer that every one in particular may in the
ſame manner bee excuſed thereby, as if he had ſaid it himſelfe,
and ſo he holds on to pray and ſay, Bleſſed be thou O Lord
our God, King of the world, who haſt created the fruit of
the vine. Bleſſed be thou O Lòrd our God, King of the world,
who haſt ſactified us by thy commandements, and given us
thine holy Sabbath, and out of thy love and good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, haſt left it as hereditary unto us, in memory of thy
workes in the creation. For it is the beginning of the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
together of thy Saints, and the memoriall of our departure
out of Egypt. Thou haſt choſen and ſanctifyed us out of all
other people, and haſt left us the Sabbath of thy holineſſe,
as a legacy of thy love and good will towards us. Bleſſled be
thou O God, who ſanctifyeſt the Sabbath. In the next place he
drinks ſome of the wine, and reacheth it to the the reſt, that
they may doe as he hath done. Then he takes the napkin from
over the bread, and taking the two loaves unto him, cuts them
not before he hath ſaid grace, contrary to that which he doth
upon the daies of the weeke, but preſently ſaith. By your
leave my Maſters and Rabbines; bleſſing the bread in this
forme: Bleſſed be thou O Lord our God, King of the world,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40423:80"/>
which brings bread out of the earth. After this he breaks a piece
of bread and eates, imparting alſo to every one at the table a
morſell, which is of greater ſize then ordinary, in honour of
the Sabbath, upon it is not lawfull for any to be niggardly, then
they eat whatſoever God hath sent.</p>

eye upon the Sabbath-lamps,<note place="margin">Orach. chajim. num. 274. Tract de Sab. c. 15. p 113.</note> becauſe that the Rabbines write,
that when any one travels upon the daies of the weeke, the
five hundred part of his ſight departs from him; for the regai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

               <p>They cover the bread, that it may not behold its owne

gives the bread the place,<note place="margin">Deut. 8. 8.</note> when it ſaith, <hi>I will bring thee
into a land of wheate and barley, of vines and figge-trees.</hi> For
here wheat is firſt named, which is the materiall of bread; yet
nevertheleſſe it is the laſt of all to be conſecrated for the uſe of
the Sabbath, which would be a great ſhame unto it if it ſhould
ſtand bare. Others affirm the bread to be covered in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the Manna: For firſt of all a certaine dew fell in the
deſart, after that, the Manna, and then another dew, between
which two it lay hid as between two napkins: And ſo the bread
upon the Jewes table lyes between two linnen clothes. Hence
it is that the women make minced pies, or boile ſome other
thing like unto it, which they eat inſtead of Manna; for their
minced pye hath a certaine lumpe for its bottom, and in the
middle it is ſtuft with fleſh, above alſo it hath a certain cover
made like unto Manna. The reaſon why they take two loaves,
is in remembrance of the Manna, whereof they gathered in
times paſt, two meaſures full upon every Friday, according to
that which is written: <hi>And it came to paſſe that on the ſixt day,</hi>

At the time of ſupper a table all of gold was brought in, which
ſixteen men were ſcarce able to carry, all the furniture and other

When the table was removed, he againe ſinging praiſes unto
God, ſaid, The heaven is the Lords, and the earth hath he
given unto the children of men. Then I ſpoke unto him, and
ſaid, Good Sir, how came you to be ſo rich? and what good
thing have you done in all your life? The Maſter, of the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,

all my life long, and whenſoever it was my chance to happen
upon ſome choiſe fatling, I alwaies reſerved it for the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of the Sabbath. From thence came this my Mammon
and great riches, which God vouchſafed unto me, as a reward
for my diligent obſervance of Sabbaths. Then ſaid I, Bleſſed be
God who hath given thee this abundance, and hath made thee
worthy to bea poſſeſſour of ſo great wealth. This befell the
Butcher.</p>
               <p>In the ſame page it is regiſtred, that there was ſometimes
one <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Mokir Schabbas,</hi> that is to ſay, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourer
of the Sabbath. This man of all thoſe victuals that the
Shambles could afford, thought nothing too deare for the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration
of the Sabbath; yea he would ſpare neither coſt nor
charges in the procurement of the moſt rare fiſhes the waters
could furniſh him withall. This <hi>Joſeph</hi> had a certaine neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
who was very rich: By him he was continually flouted,
with a goe to, what doth it profit thee that thou celebrateſt
the Sabbath in ſuch a religious manner? Certainly thou art ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the richer then if thou ſtudied the contrary. I do not reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

richer then thou art. Good <hi>Joſeph</hi> little regarding his mocks,
put his truſt in God, hoping that hee would give him a large
harveſt of rewards for theſe his weekly expences. At that time
there were certaine Aſtrologers in that City, who ſaid unto
the rich man, Friend; what availeth it thee to bee ſo rich,
when thy heart will not ſuffer thee to buy one good fiſh with

day is wont to have ſome morſell for his money. The rich

man hearing the words of theſe ſtar-gazers, and meditating
upon them, went and ſold all that he had, and with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
purchaſed many Margarites, and other precious ſtones,
all which he purſed up in a girdle of haire, and preſently takes
ſhipping for another country, that the good man <hi>Joſeph</hi> might
not inherit his goods. When he was about the middle of the
Sea, behold a great tempeſt aroſe, and did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that it was beyond expectation, if he did not take up his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

ſnatcht his hat from off his head, toſſing it into a

there ſwimming, ſwallowed up the hat together with the
girdle, wherein were the Margarites and other precious ſtones.
A little after this, this huge fiſh was taken and carried to
the City upon Friday to be ſold in the Market. Every Caterer
prized the fiſh; but for a great price ſet upon it, none could

               <p>It is alſo recorded in the Talmud,<note place="margin">Tract. Taanis. cap. 30.</note> in the Tract concerning
the faſting of one <hi>Rabbi Chonech.</hi> He was wont every Fryday,
to ſend his ſervants into the Market, and cauſe them to buy up
all the pot-herbes which the Gardiners could not put off their
hands, and then commanded them to throw them into the
rivers. The Rabbines in <hi>Gemarah,</hi> which is an appendix to
the Talmud, aske the queſtion, why he did not rather give
their herbes unto the poor? The anſwer is, that if he had given
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40423:83"/>
them to the poor, then they would have bought none for the
celebration of the Sabbath; and if it ſhould have come ſo to
paſſe that the Gardiners ſhould have withdrawne all their
pot-herbs, ſo that the poor people could not have had them,
then ſhould not the Sabbath have been celebrated by them.
Againe, the Rabbines ask why he did not give them unto the
beaſts to eat, which had been far better, then thus to throw
them into the water, where they are utterly void of profit.
The anſwer is, that hee would not have that to bee devoured
by the irreaſonable creature, which may ſerve for the proper
food of man. And that although he caſt them into the waters,
yet men might take them from thence and transfer them to
their own uſe. But why did he buy up all the pot-herbes? This
he did for the encouragement of the Gardiners, that they
might the more willingly, and with a better accord, bring
them into the Market every Friday. For if they could not
have ſold this their garbiſh for one day or two together,
then had they ſtaied at home ever after, and ſo the poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſhould have wanted food upon the Sabbath day, and by
this means the Sabbath it ſelfe ſhould have been diſhonoured:
And therefore <hi>Rabbi Chonech</hi> tooke this courſe, that the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
might bee honoured by voluptous living, and that by

               <p>It is written in the tract concerning the Sabbath,<note place="margin">Cap. 16. p. 118.</note> that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
upon the Sabbath lifts us his head, that is to ſay, who
celebrates the Sabbath with joy and rejoicing, God ſhall give
him a large inheritance, ſubdue unto him many nations, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
infinite and innumerable; as it is written: <hi>Then</hi> (that is
when thou ſhalt keep the Sabbath with joy and rejoycing, and
call it thy delight) <hi>thou ſhalt delight thy ſelf in the Lord, and
I will ſet thee upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee
with the inheritance of Jacob thy father,</hi> of whom it is written;
<hi>Thou ſhalt ſpreadforth eaſt and weſt, north and ſouth, even into the
foure corners of the earth. Rabbi Nachman</hi> averres, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
exhibites himſelfe as a pattern of merriment upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day, ſhall be free from the bondage of the nations, as it is
written, <hi>I will ſet thee upon the high places of the earth, and
thou ſhalt tread upon the necks of thine enemies Rabbi Juda</hi> ſaith,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40423:83"/>
that whoſoever keepes the Sabbath with a joifull heart, God
ſhall give him whatſoever his heart can wiſh; as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
<hi>Delight in the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 37.4.</note>

               </p>
               <p>And now ſeeing the Jewes doe not as yet tread upon the
necks of their enemies, nor are really poſſeſt of the higheſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the earth, neither have gained their hearts deſire, to
wit, that they may bee Lords and Maſters over the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
that they may enjoy the monarchy of the whole world;
for the performance of which their wiſh, they poure out
their prayers upon every Sabbath and feſtivall. It is clearly
manifeſt, that they have not as yet rightly and duly kept and
ſanctified the ſeventh day, and have not as yet delighted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
therein to the full of a ſatiety.</p>
               <p>When then in the firſt place they have feaſted themſelves
and fill'd their guts with Sabbaticall cheer with great joy and
gladneſſe, then they pray as aboveſaid. The table is left cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and ſpread untill the evening of the Sabbath. The candles
alſo lighted in honour thereof, ſtand in their lampes unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed.
Hence ariſeth a ſharpe contention among them
about the lights, what is to be done, what to be omitted. It
is not lawfull to hunt or feek for flies or lice, by the benefit of
their light; or to read or write by them, leſt ſome in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

unto the day, if any married man, but eſpecially one of the
Rabbines, who is learned and well ſeen in knowledge, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sabbath day at night, hug and kiſſe his wife a little more
then ordinary. And this is the cauſe that they eat ſtore of
potato roots before the Sabbath begin, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more valiant in the act of carnall copulation. For the
ſame cauſe marriages are commonly celebrated upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath

Hereupon the common opinion is, that the infants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got

and all of them at length attaine unto the dignity of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40423:84"/>
wiſe and holy men, chiefly then, when in the act of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the parents minds are full of good and pure cogitations;
when they come together not to fulfill the luſts of the fleſh,
but in honour to the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Laſtily, when any Jew is a travelling upon Friday, and is
diſtant from his Inne, or his own dwelling houſe at evening
more then a Sabbath dayes journey, then ought he to ſtay in
that very place, and there to reft himſelfe, and celebrate the
Sabbath whether it be in field, or in the middle of a wood,
all perils of robbers, and want of meat and drinke ſet aſide.
Concerning this matter, there is extant a true ſtory; which
runs as followeth. Upon a certaine time three Jewes went a
travelling: When it began to be night, and the Sabbath drew
near, then ſaid one to another, what courſe ſhall wee take?
the way is very dangerous by reaſon of robbers, wild and
evill beaſts do alſo haunt the woods, better it is that we hold
on, and every one become the deliverer of his owne ſoule,
then to keep the Sabbath with perill of loſing both ſoule and
body.</p>
               <p>The third ſaid, I will not depart hence until the Sabbath
be ended, for he that commanded me to ſanctifie it is able to
preſerve me in the middle of this wood. When his fellowes
perceived his reſolution, they held on their journey, beeing
Sabbath-breakers. But this third man ſtaied in the ſame place,
as though he had been nailed unto the ground, and pitching
his tent, ſpread a linnen cloth upon the earth, for want of a
better table, and ſet bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thereupon, and what other provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
he had, and ſo ſaying his evening prayer, ſate him down
to take his firſt Sabbath meale. In the mean time as he was at
his repaſt, there came a Bore unto him of ſuch an horrible
and ugly ſhape, as never eye beheld. This ſaid beaſt drawing
neare unto him, ſignified by certaine geſtures, that he was an
hungry. The Jew good man in a manner terrified, gives him
a cruſt of bread. withall feeding himſelfe with this meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that God if it pleaſed him, could eaſily preſerve him in
ſafety. The Bore never moving eats the bread which was given
him and ſtaies there ſtill. So ſoon as the Jew had ſufficiently
refreſhed himſelfe, he ſaid his evening prayer, which ended,
he lies downe upon the earth to take his reſt and ſleep, the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40423:84"/>
Bore lying downe beſides him. The morning light unlocking
his eye-lids, he was exceeding joifull, that the Bore had not
devoured him, praiſing God and giving him thanks for ſuch a
benefit; he orderly alſo pours out his morning devotions, then
taking his dinner and ſupper, and running over all his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
When the Sabbath was ended, he making a ſeparation,
divided the Sabbath from the reſt of the weeke (of which
more ſhall bee ſpoken in the next Chapter) and ſo went on
his journey, the Bore becomming his individuall companion
all the night over. Upon the ſame night his two companions
had fallen into the hands of robbers, who had ſpoiled them of
all that they had. At laſt (the Bore accompanying him) hee
overtooke them, whom ſo ſoone as the beaſt beheld, hee run
unto them, and tore them both in pieces. At the ſight where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
feare begins to benum the ſpirits of the religious Jew, and
a ſtrong opinion poſſeſſed him, that hee alſo was at the laſt
gaſpe. In the mean time, they who had robbed his fellowes,
came unto him, and queſtioned him what he was, and from
whence he travell'd. He made anſwer, I am a Jew (for having
a ſure confiden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e in God, he would not deny himſelfe) and
came from the Kings pallace, and am thus farre on my journy.
They further enquired of him where he got that Bore? Hee
anſwered, the King beſtowed him on me for a guide. Then
ſaid one of the Robbers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſurely that Jew is in great favour with
the King, becauſe his will was, he ſhould have a ſafe paſſ age by
the conduct of that Bore. And the other replyed, we will give
him all the money that wee have, and lead him out of the
wood for feare leſt he diſcover us. Which they did, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
him for a long and tedious ſpace; they alſo holding on
to direct him in the way that he was to goe, and the Bore run
back into the wood againe. The caſe ſtanding thus, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves
every Jew, committing himſelfe to the protection of
him that dwelleth in the higheſt heavens, to remember, keep,
and ſanctifie the Sabbath day with all diligence.</p>

               <head type="sub">How the Jewes celebrate their Sabbath, and alſo make an end
thereof.</head>
               <p>UPon the morning of the Sabbath,<note place="margin">Orach. chajim num. 281. nov. addit. num. 28.</note> they doe not
ſo early leave their beds, as at other times, but
ſleep untill the day be farre ſpent, and this they
doe more for their own pleaſure, then for any
due honor tendered unto the Sabbath; yet the
more pleaſure they enjoy, the more devoutly
they celebrate the Sabbath in their opinion. Their Rabbines
doe moſt magiſterially prove the lawfulneſſe of this cuſtome
out of the Law, out of the twenty eight Chapter of the fourth
booke of <hi>Moſes.</hi> When <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſay they, makes mention in that
place of the daily sacrifice, it is written, <hi>early in the morning:</hi>
But when he ſpeakes of the oblation for the ſeventh day, it is
written, in the day of the Sabbath: The meaning of which
words is this. The daily ſacrifices were wont to be offered
early in the morning before it was light (inſtead of which they
repaire at this day earely unto their Synagogue to ſay their
morning prayers) as was formerly declared. But upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
a longer ſtay was made, and the ſacrifice was not wont
to be offered before perfect day. Wherefore the Jewes ought
to ſleep larger upon this day then another, and to goe later
to morning prayer then at other times, to recreate themſelves
for a longer ſpace upon their couches, for the joy and delight
accrewing by the Sabbaths reproach.</p>
               <p>When they are once come into the Synagogue, they pray as
at other times, yet ſaying and ſinging more prayers and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themes
then ordinary, in honour of the Sabbath. Upon this
day they doe not put on their phylacteries (of which we ſpoke
in the fourth Chapter) and that becauſe the Sabbath it ſelfe is
a ſign of the Jewiſh faith, and that this was given to the Jewes
onely, and commanded by them to bee ſanctified, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40423:85"/>
they have no need of other ſignes, as the phylacteries and
circumciſion, whereby a Jew may bee knowne from other
men.</p>
               <p>They bring the booke of the Law out of the Arke in that
pompe, which we ſpecified in the ninth Chapter. They read
out of it ſeven ſections of the Law, for the performing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
ſeven particular perſons are called out. Whoſoever is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
comes up by the doore next unto him, and goes downe
by the other; becauſe it is recorded of the people of Iſrael to
have done the like. For ſaith the Scripture, <hi>the gate of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Temple which lookes unto the north, ſhall be ſhut for the ſpace
of ſix daies, wherein you may worke, but upon the Sabbath day,
and upon the day of the Calends it ſhall be opened. And the Prince
ſhall enter by the way of that gate, and ſhall ſtand at the poſts
thereof; and the Prieſts ſhall offer his burnt offering,</hi> &amp;c. Hence it
appeares, that when they come into the holy Temple upon
the Sabbath day, they came in at one doore and went out at
another.</p>
               <p>They are alſo accuſtomed to read ſome certaine ſections out
of the Prophets; in which the ſame ſubject is handled, that is
treated of in the bookes of <hi>Moſes.</hi> This cuſtome then had its
originall, when they were interdicted to reade the bookes of
<hi>Moſes</hi> in their Synagogues. For at that time they began to read
in the pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e thereof, a Lecture out of the Prophets, which
they named <hi>Hapharah,</hi> which was as a certain expoſition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> This cuſtome was in force in the daies
of the Apoſtles; for thus it is recorded. <hi>For they that dwell at
Jeruſalem, and their rulers, becauſe they knew him not, nor yet
the voices of the Prophets which are read every Sabbath day,
they have fulfilled them in condemning him.</hi> Again, <hi>Moſes of old
time had them that preached him, being read in the Synagogues
every Sabbath day.</hi> And although at this day they are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
to read and teach <hi>Moſes</hi> in their Synagogues; yet they
keepe the cuſtome of reading the Prophets; for they cannot
be too converſant in well doing.</p>
               <p>They pray alſo for the ſoules of them,<note place="margin">Minhag. p. 12. Orach chajim. num. 288.</note> who in their life
time did not rightly ſanctify the Sabbath. For the Rabbines
perſwade themſelves, that theſe are toſſed in hell from ſide to
ſide both after and before the Sabbath, and therefore they pray
for them thereupon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:40423:86"/>
Their prayers in the Synagogue muſt not continue any
longer then ſix a clock in the morning. For it is forbidden ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to faſt or pray any longer, according as their Doctors
have collected out of that ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt call the Sabbath
Oneg.</hi> For the word <hi>Oneg</hi> ſignifying delight or pleaſure, is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
without the letter <hi>Vau,</hi> which in numeration, maketh
ſix. By which the Prophet would ſecretly inſinuate, that we
ought not to faſt after the ſixt hour, or the middle of the day;
becauſe otherwiſe it would come to paſſe, that the Sabbath
ſhould not be a pleaſure, but rather a vexation unto us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
morning prayer being ended, they eate their ſecond Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baticall
meale, making themſelves merry in honour of the
Sabbath.</p>
               <p>If any have dreamed ſome ominous dream; as the book of
the Law to be burnt, the beams of his own houſe to fall down,
his teeth to fall out of his head, or ſuch like, he muſt faſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
it be late at night, and that not without cauſe, ſeeing ſuch
phantaſticall meteors portend no faire weather. If the jaw
bones of any one in the time of ſleep, ſeem unto him in the
time of ſleep to fall out of their place, ſuch a dream is a good
dreame, becauſe it betokens the teeth of all his enemies that
intended evill againſt him. If to eate be burdenſome unto any,
and to faſt a pleaſure, he may faſt by ſtatute. If any cannot ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine
from teares, he may weep by authority, becauſe ſuch a
ones lamentation, is his owne delight, his adverſaries recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
both which are conducible to a ſanctifyed celebration
of the Sabbath. Yetnot withſtanding, whoſoever faſts upon
the ſeventh day, he muſt faſt alſo upon the day following, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he feared not to ſubſtract the pleaſure due unto the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day.</p>
               <p>Moreover it ſeemeth good unto the wiſe men among the
Jewes, that dinner being ended, that ſomewhat ſhould bee
learned by ſtudy, and ſome Chapters read o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t of the holy
Bible.<note place="margin">Min. page. 13. Caphtor Upe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach p 43.</note> For upon a certaine time, the Sabbath complained unto
God, that every thing in this univerſe had a like unto it ſelfe,
of which it was onely deſtitute. Then God inſtantly replyed,
and ſaid, The people of Iſrael ſhall from henceforth be thy
mate; for they upon the Sabbath day bend their ſtudy to the
learning of the Law, which if they did not, they would at that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40423:86"/>
time be altogether idle. Then the Law poſting unto Gods
tribunall, poured out its complaints and ſaid; When Iſrael
ſhall returne into his owne land, and one ſhall goe unto his
farme, another to his vineyard, who ſhall then learn or ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
me. God anſwered, the Iſraelites ſhall doe it, who reſting
upon the Sabbath, ſhall practiſe nothing elſe. By reaſon of
theſe complaints, it was concluded and thought meet, that
upon the Sabbath day after dinner, every one ſhould buſie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
either in reading of the word of God, or, in collecting
ſomething out of their bookes of morality, whereby they
might be incited unto the feare of the Lord, and ſo the Law
and Sabbath might not have any more juſt occaſion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.
But alas how rare readers they are in theſe good books,
experience gives an evident demonſtration for the whole
weeks ſpace; time enough a man would think. They ſpeake
not ſo much of their bargaines, uſury, buying and ſelling, as
they do upon the Sabbath day.</p>
               <p>At even-tide they returne againe into the Synagogue, and
prayer ended, they fall to their ſupper, the third and laſt meal
upon this day, while the day is not yet gone, nor the Sabbath
altogether come to its period. They doe not at this time eate
much, becauſe their time is ſhort and becauſe they are bound
to ſhut up the Sabbath with thankſgivings. Moreover, it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
fals out, that when this meale is provided for them, they
are not an hungry, becauſe they filled their paunhes more

her; for which reaſon ſhe protracting the time of her returne

which the woman taking notice of, through feare ſtreaming
from the fountaine of his choler into the channels of her body,
made her let the paile of water to ſlip out of her hand unto
the ground; whereupon ſome few cooling drops being by the
fall beſprinkled upon the diſeaſed body of her raging husband,
were as ſo many skilfull Chirurgions to the place they onely
touched. This the good man got for his anger, who if hee

Maſter of every private family doth it in his owne dwelling,
in manner and forme following. A great candle is lighted much
like unto a Torch, which they call <hi>Ner habdalah,</hi> or the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of diviſion or deſtruction. Then they bring in a little box
commonly made of ſilver, full of the beſt perfumes. In the next
place the Maſter of the family takes a cup full of wine (but if
there be no wine in that country, then he takes ale or beer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
thereof) and ſings with a loud and ſhrill voice, <hi>The
Lord is my Salvation and my truſt, I will not feare, becauſe he is
my ſtrength and my praiſe God the Lord is my health. He hath
delivered me out of all my trouble, and mine eye hath ſeen her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

               </p>
               <p>Theſe words ended, he bleſſeth the cup, and pouring a little
of the wine therein upon the ground, he ſaith, Bleſſed bee
thou O Lord our God, King of the world, who haſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Bleſſed be thou O God, who doſt create divers kinds of
perfumes; He puts the box unto his noſe to recreate his ſmell,
and reacheth it to every one in the family for the ſame end.
Then taking the cup againe in his right hand, he goes unto
the great candle, uſing no ſmall delight in an exquiſite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of the nailes upon his fingers, ſo that bending his
fingers towards his wriſt, they caſt a certaine ſhadow upon
the palme; after this he ſtretcheth forth his hand the ſecond
time, ſo that he may know by the candle light, that his nailes
are whiter then his fingers, which he perceiving, ſaith, Bleſſed
be thou O God our God, King of the world, who haſt created
ſuch a reſplendent candle. Then he takes the cup againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his left hand, looking in the like manner upon the nailes
thereof. Then by and by he transfers the cup into the right

Sabbath.</p>
               <p>They ſmell the perfumes, leſt they ſhould fall into a ſwoon,
while one of their ſoules departs out of the body. For upon
the Sabbathday they have another ſoule beſides that which
they live by at other times. Concerning this matter, <hi>Antonius
Margarita,</hi> in his booke of the faith of the Jewes, writes in
this manner. It is written in the Jewiſh Talmud (ſaith he) that
every man hath three ſoules, and it is proved out of theſe
following words of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Thus ſaith the Lord,
who created the heaven, and ſtretched it out, who made the earth,
and whatſoever groweth thereon; who giveth life and breath unto
the inhabitants of it.</hi> According to the letter of this text,
they find two ſoules in man, to which if we add the naturall
ſoule, there ariſeth three. Whereupon they alſo write, that
two ſoules depart out of a man ſleeping, the one of which goes
upward unto God, to learne things to come, the other goes
downward into the earth, and running to and fro, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates
nothing elſe but injuſtice, ſinne, fooliſhneſſe or vanity.
The third they call <hi>Ruach Behemoth,</hi> the irreaſonable ſoule,
which being the firſt of all received by man, is ſeated neare
unto his heart, and ſees all things whatſoever the other two
ſoules in their abſence from the body have heard ſeen or done;
and hence proceed and iſſue all our dreames, which therefore
are not alwaies to be contemned. They ſay moreover, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sabbath a man hath another ſoule beſides theſe, which
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40423:89"/>
enlarges his heart, that he may keep the Sabbath more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably,
and exhilarate himſelfe in a higher ſtraine of mirth,
then it were poſſible for him to doe, if hee were deſtitute of
the ſame. But the Sabbath once being ended, this ſoule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts,
and the man becomes weake thereupon, againſt which
his faintneſſe, hee may proſperouſly uſe theſe ſweet ſmelling
odours, that the body may have wherewith to recover its
former ſtrength. Hitherto <hi>Margarita,</hi> but whence he had theſe
words, I cannot as yet finde.</p>

<hi>The Sabbath ſhall be an everlaſting ſigne between me and the

in their <hi>Gemarah</hi> ask the queſtion, that if the Chriſtians and
other people do not know that we have a Sabbath, how comes
it to paſſe, that they in time to come ſhall be puniſhed for the
contempt of the Sabbath, and for the not keeping thereof?
They make anſwer to themſelves, ſaying, they know well
enough that wee keep the Sabbath, this is not hidden from
their eyes, and therefore they are to be puniſhed becauſe they
will not keepe it. But the reward due unto the obſervance
thereof, is hidden from them, and this they know not; yet
if they would rightlly celebrate the Sabbath, they ſhould alſo
know thereward. But this is a thing impoſſible for them to
put in execution, ſeeing they are deſtitute of the ſuperfluous
ſoule, becauſe it being given to men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rather upon that day then

ſay, that this is done in remembrance of that garment, which

to diſtinguiſh the nailes from the fleſh; which wonderfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration

ſtory in the Talmud. That wicked man <hi>Turnus Rophus</hi> upon
a certaine time, demanded of <hi>Rabbi Akibha,</hi> in what reſpect
the Sabbath did excell other daies of the weeke, that they
ſhould proſecute it with ſo great honour. The Rabbine reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
why doe mortals more honour thee, then other men of
the ſame mould? becauſe ſaid the King, my liege will have it
ſo. To whom <hi>Rabbi Akibha</hi> anſwered againe, The King of
Kings, even our God himſelfe, wils us to give more honour
and reverence unto the Sabbath, then to any day in the weeke
beſides. <hi>Turnus</hi> replies, who can certainly aſſure thee, that your
Sabbath day is the ſeventh day, and ſo the true Sabbath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
perhaps you may celebrate it upon ſome other. The
Rabbine anſwers, this may be proved, 1. By a water-courſe
of the River <hi>Sambation,</hi> who eſtreame is ſo headſtrong for the
ſpace of ſix daies, that it roles huge great ſtones along with
it; by reaſon whereof, it denies any one paſſage for the whole
weeke, but upon the Sabbath day it ſtands unmoveable not
running at all, in honour to the Sabbath. 2. I can draw an
evident argument for the demonſtration hereof, from thy
fathers Sepulchre: For all the weeke long, the ſmoake and
ſtench of hell fire iſs;ues out of it, becauſe for that ſpace he is
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40423:90"/>
tormented therein; but upon the Sabbath day, the Sepulchre
ſends out no ill ſavour; the reaſon is, thy father at that time is
come out of hell, and takes his reſt, ſo that the fire thereof
hath no power over him, and for this very cauſe ſmoaks not
upon that day. When <hi>Turnus</hi> heard theſe words of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine,
he ſaid unto him, peradventure the time of his adjudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to hell torments is now expired? The Rabbine bids him
goe unto thy fathers tombe, the Sabbath now ended, and ſee
if it doe not ſmoake as yet. Which <hi>Turnus</hi> hearing, went and
found it to be as the Rabbine had ſpoken.</p>
               <p>This moved <hi>Turnus</hi> to a hainous enterprize, for by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments,
he cals his father from hell, and thus beſpeaks
him. How comes it to paſſe (ſaid hee) who diddeſt not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
the Sabbath all thy life long, ſhouldeſt now being dead,
obſerve and keep it? How farre is the time ſpent, ſince thou
becameſt ſo godly a Jew? He anſwered, My ſonne, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
living among you will not keep the Sabbath willingly
in this place after death, muſt be forced thereunto. The ſonne
replies, how are you occupied I pray you upon the worke
dayes? Upon them, ſaith he, ſome burns us with fire; but upon
the Sabbath day we enjoy our reſt: For upon Friday at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
a Proclamation goes forth, declaring that the time of
ceſlation is now preſent, and that the wicked ſhould depart
to celebrate the Sabbath; which we hearing, betake our ſelves
to reſt, and in reſting, ſanctifie the Sabbath. Then in the end
of the Sabbath, when the Jewes have ended all their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
then comes an evill Angell called <hi>Dumah,</hi> who is our
Maſter, and commands us to returne into hell, becauſe the
people of Iſrael have now put an end to their Sabbath. Then
wee recoiling into hell, are ſcorched by the flames thereof,
untill the next Sabbath. Theſe are our infernall imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>If any have an itching deſire to read any more concerning
theſe horrible trifling fopperies, let him reade <hi>Rabbi Bechai,
in parſcha vaiiſchma Jethro,</hi> that is, in his expoſition upon
the eighteenth Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> where hee writes many
things about the Sabbath. Now ſeeing God in the Law of
<hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, oftentimes commanded the Jewes,
that upon the ſeventh day they ſhould doe no manner of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40423:91"/>
work, and ſo abſtaine from the prophanation thereof. Hence
ariſeth a grand controverſie among the Rabbines, what may
be done, what left und one thereupon, Concerning which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
there is a large tract in the Talmud, upon which the chiefe
and moſt learned Rabbines, have written a Commentary; ſo
that whoſoever could broach the moſt ſubtle and acute me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations,
concerning the genuine manner of ſanctifying the
Sabbath, he was, or certainly would have been accounted a
teacher unto others. I will onely repeat ſome few things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
to the matter in hand.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, whereas God in his Law commands, that not

how far any beaſt, as horſe, aſſe, or others of the ſame kinde,
may lawfully goe upon the Sabbath day? Whether alſo any of
theſe creatures may be allowed to carry any burden thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">Tract. de Sab. cap. 5. p 52.</note>
This queſtion is fully ſtated, and that doctor‐like determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of in the Talmud.</p>
               <p>1. No beaſt muſt be ſuffered to go out of doores upon the
Sabbath,<note place="margin">Orach. chajim num. 305.</note> carrying more upon them, then that wherewith hee
may be led, curbed, and kept under. So a horſe or an aſſe going
out of his Maſters ſtable, muſt have nothing upon him but a
bridle or halter.</p>
               <p>2. An ape, monkey, beagle, hunting‐dog, muſt not go out
of doores without a coller, to which a leaſh muſt be tyed,
that they may not ſlie away and eſcape: Yet alſo they uſe
theſe creatures thus upon other dayes then the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>It is alſo prohibited to ſaddle an horſe, much more that
any man ſhould ride, or lay any burden upon him, leſt hee
ſhould bee over‐loaden to his hurt. If any upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day returne home, or goe to ſome Inne upon the backe
of an horſe or aſſe, it is lawfull for him to looſe his ſaddle,
but not to take it off; but if the horſe or aſſe chance to ſhake
it off, then is the horſe‐man faultleſſe, and to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed.</p>
               <p>If any lead his horſe by the bridle, he muſt have a ſerious
care that he ſuffer not the bridle to hang an hands breadth from
his off his hand; and thus he muſt doe, leſt ſome ſhould thinke
that he carries it in that faſhion for his owne pleaſure. Hee
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40423:91"/>
muſt furthermore, take heed that the bridle hang not too
looſely betwixt him and the horſe, for in ſo doing, hee ſhal
ſeeme not to lead the horſe, but to carry the rainges for the

Sabbath.</p>
               <p>It is contrary to their religion, to ſuffer a hen to have a
clout or rag about her foot or wing, as a marke whereby ſhee
may be known of the owner upon the Sabbath day. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the clout ought to bee taken away upon the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,

full of water, ſo that the beaſt cannot conveniently eat its fod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
then they caſt in lopps of ſtraw to underprop it, that it
may not bee drowned in the water, if it can by this meanes
eſcape it. If by its own help it can lift it ſelfe out of the ditch,
then the Jew is blameleſſe, and not guilty of the profanation
of the Sabbath.</p>

Christs time it was permitted unto the Jewes, to draw a beast
out of a pit upon the Sabbath day: Whereas the canon Law of
the Jewes, which is their ſpirituall and Talmudicall Law, is
diametrically oppoſite hereunto. And hen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40423:92"/>
the inditement in his Commentary upon St <hi>Matthews</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
in Hebrew. To which I anſwer, that Chriſt the
truth it ſelfe, never could ſpeak any thing but truth, for there
was never any falſhood or guile found in his mouth; yea
ſooner then the Jewes, together with their father the father of
lies the devill, can evidence the contrary, theſe ſuperſtitious
brats ſhall ſuffer eternall ſhame. It is true indeed, that the law
contained at this preſent in the Talmud, is of that ſtampe,
that out of it Chriſt may be proved a lyar; as amongst others,
an inſtance urged by <hi>Munſter</hi> out of a Saxon Hiſtory, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a certaine Jew, who upon the Sabbath day (ſir reverence)
fell into a Jakes, makes manifest; For he being left there, was
ſuſtained with food, and not preſently drawne out. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of the place alſo ſtrictly charging and commanding the
Jewes, that they ſhould not draw him out upon the Lords
day, holy in the ſacred ſolemnization thereof to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
Whereupon it came to passe, that for two daies ſpace,
he was forced to remaine in this, houſe of office, that he might
the better learn his duty. I confeſſe therefore, that their Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudicall
decrees which are in force with them at this day, are
contrary to Chriſts ſayings; but that it was ſo from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
it is a manifest untruth. For 1. The traditions and
conſtitutions of the Jewes themſelves, according to which
they lived in Chriſts time, brand it with no leſſe. And againe,
how came it to paſſe, that if Chriſt had lied or ſpoken falſe,
the Phariſees did not preſently hit him in the teeth there with?
Certainly the Phariſees would have contradicted the words of
our Savior, if he had ſpoken any thing oppugning their common
traditions and ordinances. Now if any ask how it came to paſs,
that this was inſerted into the Law, which they at this day
embrace. I anſwer, that it is a new conſtitution foiſted by
the Rabbines and Writers of the Talmud, into their <hi>Gemara,</hi>
or their Appendix of ancient traditions in hatred to the New
Teſtament and Chriſtian Religion, ſome hundred of yeares
after Chriſts nativity,<note place="margin">Tract. de Sab. c. 18. p. 128.</note> as appeares moſt manifeſtly out of the
Talmud. For into this they thruſt in ſuch a tradition, that they
might perſwade the ignorant, that Chriſt ſpoke falſe. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to the matter in hand.</p>
               <p>It is permitted unto a Jew, to ſpeake unto a Chriſtian to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:40423:92"/>
milke his cow or goate, leſt the milke through its abundance,
ſtraining the beaſt, ſhould put it to miſerable torture; not that
the Jew hath any deſire to bee fed with the milke, for ſo it
were all one, as if he ſhould have milked her himſelfe. This
being granted, that whatſoever aman doth by another, it is
all one as if he did it himſelfe. Whereupon it hath ſeemed
good to ſome of their Doctors, that a Jew may buy milke for
his money of the Chriſtians, that hee may lawfully upon the
Sabbath day, feed thereupon; ſeeing the Christian milkes the
cow for his owne gaine, and not in any love to the Jew.
But ſeeing these things are to full of quirkes, and cannot bee
ſufficiently deſcribed, wee will let them paſſe, and deſcend
to others. Something therefore is now to bee ſpoken of
the reſt and ſanctifying of the Sabbath concerning every
one.</p>

               <p>It is an offence to bind up a green wound given upon the

               <p>It is a capitall piece of buſineſſe, to carry gold or mony, or
any other coine, packed up in a ſacke or ſatchell, or ſewed in

               <p>It is lawfull for them to wipe off the clay cleaving to their feet,<note place="margin">Orach. chajim num. 301.</note>

               <p>It is lawfull to kill a louſe. Yet <hi>Rabbi Eliezer</hi> ſaith, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
kils a louſe upon the Sabbath day, his treſpaſſe is as hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
as if he had kill'd a Camel.</p>
               <p>Concerning the two laſt Canons, and the true meaning of
them, there have been many and hot diſputations. Some
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40423:93"/>
have concluded, that it is not lawfull to kill any creatures
upon the Sabbath day, which do multiply according to the
ordinary courſe of nature; of which ſort are fleas, who by a
naturall commixture hatch egs; and on the contrary, to deſtroy
all thoſe, whoſe originall is from ſweet and corrupt humours;
to which kind lice may be referred. Although in this cauſe a
certaine doubt ariſeth, becauſe it is the poſition of a certaine
Rabbine, that an egg is the mother of a louſe. Hence a Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine;
God ſitting in heaven, feeds all his creatures, from the
Rhunoceros horne, to the egg of a louſe, that is to ſay, all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
creatures from the greatest to the leaſt. The full ſtate of
this queſtion may be had in the Talmud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore there is
no neceſſity that it ſhould bee here inſerted, and that chiefly
for this reaſon, becauſe every one is not apt to dive into the
depth of such ſubtilties.</p>
               <p>It is not permitted to any, to clime a tree upon this day, leaſt

               <p>If any one have hens, or any other creatures in a garden, or
other place expoſed to raine, he muſt have an exact care, that
he give them not any more corne for their ſuſtenance, then
they may at once eat up, for otherwiſe the reliques would
ſprout out, the raine making paſſage for it, and the Jew ſhould
be guilty of ſowing ſeed upon the Sabbath, and so become the
father of an hainous offence.</p>
               <p>It is not jawfull to play upon any kind of inſtrument,<note place="margin">Orach. chajim, num<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 338.</note> having

               <p>It is forbidden to ſing a pſalme, or any other ſong, with the

               <p>It is not permitted to any, sor to hiſt unto his fellow, to

               <p>It is not lawfull for any one to knock at a doore with an

And this is the cauſe that the Maſter of the Synagogue beates
their doores with his hand, at what time they are to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
their devotions. Yet the Rabbines have permitted, that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40423:94"/>
the Jewes may entreat a Chriſtian to play on the Sabbath day
upon a lute, or to finger any other inſtrument in honour of
the newly initiated nuptials of the married couple; never sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
that it is done for the Jewes ſake, as alſo ſeeing hereby,
the vulgar jollity is more profuse upon that day, for a more
exquiſite celebration. No Jew at all is permitted to play upon
any inſtrument by Act of Parliament, because it ſavours not
of godlineſſe, to play a Curranto upon the table, either to
this end, that ſome may dance, or to ſtill a pettiſh child.</p>
               <p>None muſt preſume to write with his finger upon a wet
table, or in the ſand or duſt of the earth; yet they may imprint
as many characters in the air, as they ſhalthink meet. Moreover,
no writing written either upon paper, or ſealed with wax, is
to be ſcratched out.</p>
               <p>Briefly, the Jewes have thirty nine chiefe and principall
Articles, concerning workes and labours, to which all others
may be reduced, which can be poſſible conceived. For even
as a fountaine is parted in its gliding pace into ſeverall ſtreams
and rivulets, which alwaies keep ſome reſemblance and analogy
with their head, though oftentimes they loſe their naturall
taſte and qualities, by reaſon of the places and channels in
which they keep their courſe: Even ſo out of thoſe chiefe
Articles concerning the labours of the Jewes, many moe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
ariſe and iſſue, as the River from the fountaine, which
labours ſeem to differ much from the other, yet they alwaies
doe correſpond in ſome ſimilitude; for example. The firſt and

               <p>The ſecond Article, is concerning the <hi>cutting down and reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

olives, olive berries; the gathering of figs and apples; the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of honey out of the Bee hive, and many moe of the ſame
nature. Hence it is permitted to taſte or eate an apple hanging
upon the bough or branch upon the Sabbath day, but by no
meanes to pluck it off. It is unlawfull to goe through a field
of corne, especially if the weather be rainy, for the seed may
be rooted up by the heele, which is all one as if it were cut
with the ſickle. Hence it was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Jewes reprehended the
Diſciples of our Saviour,<note place="margin">Mar. 13.</note> for pulling the eares of corne upon
the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>To the Article of threſhing, are referred the peeling, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

of any fruits which are full of moiſture; as olives, oren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
apples, grapes, the wringing of any wet cloth, and ſuch
like. The giving of ſucke is alſo to be referred to this Article,
yet the Rabbines do not agree in opinion concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Hereupon it is much queſtioned, whether a Nurſe being
bewraied by a child upon the Sabbath day, may lawfully make
her ſelfe cleane? Many hold that ſhee ought to waſh her hands,
by the meanes whereof, the filth may by little and little bee
done away. But <hi>Rabbi Joſe</hi> diſlikes the opinion, and prohibits
the doing of it, ſeeing ſuch a waſhing cannot goe in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ordinary ones. Thus I have ſhowne you three of their
Articles, which in the Talmud are called the fathers of labour,
by which you may eaſily know how to judge of the reſt, only

and ſanctifying thereof; yet experience it ſelfe, to which
both their conſciences and doctrine give witnesse, cries out,
that they not at any time kept and ſanctified it as they ought.
<hi>Rabbi Jochanan</hi> in that treatiſe of the Talmud about the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
in the ſixteenth Chapter and the hundred and eighteenth
page, affirms, That whoſoever keeps the Sabbath as he ought,
and as the ſtrict rule there of requires, and abſtaines from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,

                  </gap>ns; which he proves out
of the fifty ſixt Chapter of Iſaiah, and the ſecond verſe, where
it is thus written; <hi>Bleſſed is the man who doth this, and the
ſonne of man who laies hold upon it, and who keeps the Sabbath
and pollutes it not, <gap reason="foreign">

ſo the word in the originall moſt properly ſignifies. Yet the
skilfull rabbines will not have written <hi>Mechallelo</hi> but <hi>Machol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi>
which ſignifies, he hath obtained remiſſion. <hi>Rabbi Jehuda</hi>
ſaith, that if the people of Iſrael had ſanctified the firſt Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
after the giving of the Law in that manner which they
ought, there had never any ſtrange nation borne rule over
them. For as it is recorded upon the ſeventh day after the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the Law,<note place="margin">Exod. 16. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>ſome of the people went out to gather manna,

fought against Israel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 17. 8.</note> as it is written in the next Chapter. <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi
Jochanan</hi> in the name of <hi>Rabbi Simeon,</hi> who was the ſonne
of <hi>Jochai,</hi> saith, that if Iſrael at this day, could but rightly keep
two Sabbaths, one immediately following the other, they
ſhould be preſently delivered out of their bondage; as it is
written:<note place="margin">Isa. 56 4,7.</note> 
                  <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, they that keep my Sabbaths.</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Even unto them will I give within my houſe and within my wals,
a place and a name better then of ſonnes and daughters: I will give
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40423:95"/>
them an everlaſting name, which ſhall not be cut off: Even them
will I bring to my holy mountaine, and make them joyfull in my
houſe of prayer.</hi> Becauſe therefore the Jewes are not delivered
unto this day, yea are almoſt past hopes of a future deliverance,
it muſt neceſſarily follow, that as yet they have not ſanctifyed
the Sabbath as they ought: Yea, they themſelves confeſs ſo much,
ſaying, that they were deficient herein in the times forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the deſtruction of the ſecond Temple, and that this was
the reaſon why Jeruſalem was laid waſte; for thus they hold
on in the Talmud. <hi>Abhai</hi> ſaith, that Jeruſalem was deſtroied,
by reason her inhabitants profaned the Sabbath, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
<hi>Her Prieſts have violated my Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 22. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>and have profaned
my holy things: They have put no difference between the holy
and the profane, neither have they ſhewed difference between the
clean and the unclean; they have hidden their eyes from my Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 31.</note>
                  <hi>and I am profaned among them. Therefore have I poured
out mine indignation upon them.</hi> And even ſo do the Jewes at
this day; for they observe and keep the Sabbath onely with
a good cup of wine, ſome dainty diſhes of fleſh and fiſh, and al
kind of pleaſures to the utmoſt reach of their abilitie. They
abſtaine from all outward workes, yea they will not have the
leaſt finger in any thing which may carry any ſhew of labour
with it, or which may adminiſter any occasion, which may
become a provocation to ſome worke or other. So often as
they are neceſſitated, as in the winter time to the making of
fires at ſundry times, to the ſnuffing of candles, putting out of
their lampes, laying their meate to the fire, milking their
kine, and ſuch like, they hire ſome poore ſerving man who
is a Chriſtian, to do the ſame. Hence they are wont to glory,
that they are the ſole Lords, Maſters and Free-men of the
Chriſtians vaſſals and bond-ſlaves; and they who ſitting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
a hot furnace, ſhall doe all their workes for them. It
were therefore in my opinion, very meet and convenient that
the Chriſtian Magiſtrates ſhould interdict all thoſe that are
their ſubjects, to do any ſuch ſervile workes for the Jewes,
either upon the Sabbath, or at any other time.</p>
               <p>I ſhould have brought ſome certaine of their prayers, for
a concluſion of this Chapter, in the moſt of which they re-member
to pray againſt the Chriſtians; Wherein they beſeech
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40423:96"/>
God, that hee would vouchſafe to give unto the Jewes, the
riches of the Gentiles, that he would utterly confound the
Ammonites, Moabites, and Edomites (for by this meanes
they Chriſten us at this day) that he would ſmite all people
with great feare and vexation, and ſtirre up great warres and
tumults among the nations, even from the East unto the
west. But because I have decreed to reſerve theſe, and many
others for another tract, I here omit them, and conclude

Moone begins her courſe, is the beginning of the yeare, from
which they begin to reckon, and order aright their ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Their common yeare takes its beginning from the first of
September, by them called <hi>Tiſri,</hi> in the time of the new moon.
Hence we read of a foure-fold new yeare in the Talmud. The
first begins upon the firſt day of <hi>Niſan,</hi> or March; it is the new
yeare, wherein begins the computation of the reigns of their
Kings, and celebration of their Feaſts. The ſecond begins upon
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40423:97"/>
the firſt day of the month, <hi>Elul</hi> or Auguſt, and is called the
new yeare of the bringing up of cattell. The third takes its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
from the firſt day of <hi>Schebeth</hi> or January, and it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the new yeare for trees.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rabbi Hillel</hi> ſaith, that this year begins on the fifteenth day
of the foreſaid moneth. The laſt is called the New yeare of
yeares, to wit of the yeare of remiſſion of Jubilee, of the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of trees and herbes, and it begin upon the firſt of <hi>Tiſri,</hi> or
September. So much the Talmud: Which is thus to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
               <p>The yeare of Kings, is that yeare according to which they
reckon the yeares of their reigne in all Contracts, Indentures,
Bils and Bonds, made in the yeare of ſuch or ſuch a King; ſo
that though any King do begin his reigne a month onely, or a
weeke,<note place="margin">Note that their firſt of March is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of our Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary.</note> yea but a day before the firſt of March, yet is time
reckoned unto him for a whole yeare, and the firſt of March
next enſuing, they begin to write the ſecond year of his reign.
In the ſame manner the firſt day of March is the time from
whence they begin to number their annuall Feaſts, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidaies.
So the Feaſt of the Paſſeover is kept in the firſt
moneth; the Feaſt of Tabernacles in the ſeventh moneth, and
so forth.</p>
               <p>2. The beginning of Auguſt, begins the yeare of the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
up of their cattell, from whence they begin to reckon
the yeare and moneth, in which ſuch and ſuch a beaſt was
brought forth, ſo that by this meanes they more eaſily pay
tithe unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>3. The firſt day of the new Moon in September, is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of yeares, becauſe from this day they have alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
the computation of years from the Creation of the world,
to this preſent time. The yeare of reſt or remiſſion, which was
the ſeventh yeare or Sabbaticall yeare, when their fields and

               <p>Laſtly, The firſt day (or according to <hi>Rabbi Hillel</hi>) the
fifteenth of January did begin the new yeare of trees and fruits.
for according to the time that the trees before or after this
day, did bring forth their fruits, so were they permitted, or
not permitted, to be eaten; and according to this ſupputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they payed their ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the beginning of this month, are dates and orenges, and ſuch
like, which were lawfull to bee eaten the yeare not run out.
But they which brought forth fruit, which was not come to
its full growth, the yeare not yet ended, it was not permitted
unto any, to eat thereof, before the fifteenth day of January.
They payed tithes in like manner of the former ſort, but not
of theſe. This is at large handled in the fore-cited place of
the Talmud, <hi>Antonius Margarita</hi> in his booke of the faith of
the Jewes, ſaith, that the Jewes write, that the trees firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

which experience teacheth for a truth. In the Germane Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagin,
it is recorded, that none ought to kill a Gooſe in Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,
becauſe there is one fatall houre in this moneth, in

let him take the liver of the Gooſe and eat it, and no danger

               <p>The Sabbath immediately foregoing the Feaſt of the passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
is among the Jewes an high and great day. In this the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40423:98"/>
Rabbines make an Oration to the people, in which they give
a tedious inſtruction unto the people, concerning the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall
lamb, and the use thereof. This Sabbath they call the great
Sabbath, a great miracle, hapning upon the ſame, being god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
thereunto.</p>
               <p>It is written in the ſecond book of <hi>Moſes, the tenth day of
this month,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 12 3, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>they ſhall take to them every man a lambe, according
to the houſe of their fathers, a lambe for an houſe. And yee ſhall
keep it up untill the fourteenth day of the ſame month; and the
whole congregation of Iſrael ſhall kill it in the evening.</hi> Upon
which words the Rabbines write as followeth. Our fathers (say
they) taking up their lambes upon the tenth day, bound them
in their foulds, that they might keepe them unto the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth.
Which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſeeing, made enquiry what they
meant to doe with them; to whom the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> anſwered,
that they would kill them againſt the Feaſt of the paſſeover.
The <hi>Egyptians</hi> perceiving that they were about to ſlaughter and
ſacrifice that creature which they worſhipped as a creating god
(for the Ram is a ſigne of the Zodiacke) were greatly perplexed,
and began to imagine evill againſt Iſrael. Then God wrought a
miracle, ſmiting the minds of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> with feare and
amazement, yea with ſuch an agony, that they were not able
to wag their tongue againſt the children of Iſrael, nor to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
them with the ſmalleſt annoyance of a miſchiefe. Hence
was (say they) that anſwer of <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 8. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>It is not
meet to doe ſo, for then wee ſhould offer unto the Lord our God,
that which is an abomination unto the Egyptians. Loe can we ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and they
not ſtone us? Abomination,</hi> that is, that Lambe, the killing
whereof, will be in the eies of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> an abominable
and hainous offence, ſeeing they adore him as a God.</p>
               <p>Inſomuch alſo, as it pleaſed the Lord so to worke with the
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> that they had neither ſtrength nor power to doe
any harme unto the children of Israel, and that in ſuch a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
manner; therefore they ſtile this Sabbath, which is the
harbinger to the paſſeover, and uſhereth in the celebration
by the name of the great Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Againe it is written,<note place="margin">Exod. 13. 7.</note>

they gather thus much, that when the time of the Feaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth,
they ought with all diligence, to ſeek out all the
leavened bread in their houſes, and every parcell of leaven
that may be found; to wash with water all their kneading
troughes, and other veſſels; and in the ſecond place, to have in
a readineſſe new dough for to make unleavened bread againſt
the Paſſeover. Therefore two or three daies at least before the
Feaſt, they begin to bruſh up and make handſome all their
houshold ſtuffe in that forme and manner, which decency per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades,
and neceſſity requires.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place they take a great Caldron uſed for the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration
of Feſtivals, which they fill full of water, and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it over the fire, cauſe it to boile. Into this they caſt all
their woodden and pewter veſſels; and after the ſcalding wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hath ſufficiently looſed the adherent filth, they take them
out and waſh them in cold water, which done, every veſſell
is held for pure and undefiled. If any thing or other by reaſon
of the bigneſſe thereof, cannot be put into the foreſaid Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,
as a chaire, ſtoole, table, or ſuch like, then they take a
red hot iron or ſtone, holding it in a paire of tongs over the
table, pouring water in great abundance thereupon, whereby
the table, chaire or ſtoole, may be waſhed. They make no
ſpare of water, for if any part of the foreſaid things be untou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
therewith, they remaine undefiled. They daube with
clay the kneading trough, after it bee throughly waſhed, and
ſet it aſide in ſome corner of the houſe. They fill their great
Caldrons being formerly cleansed, with hot water; which
done, they caſt three live coales thereinto ſo fierce, that they
make the water to hiſſe againe, and then waſh them in cold
water.</p>
               <p>For the more eaſie cleanſing of pewter and leaden veſſels,
they uſe two paire of tongs, with the one putting them into
the Caldron, and with the other, taking them out; to this
end; that by this mutuall change, the veſſels may bee made
cleane. They caſt their veſſels of iron; as little pots, dripping
pans, broiling irons, and ſuch like, into the fire, where they
let them remaine untill they ſparkle with heat, and then they
are clean in eſtimation. They fill their braſſe and iron mortars

with coales, binding a thread about them, which by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency

they purge and cleanſe the old leavened bread, which they
formerly ſought for with ſo much diligence.</p>
               <p>Upon the night before the paſſeover, every one, who is
Maſter of a family, takes a platter and a wing, and lighting a
wax candle before he begins his ſearch, ſaith, Bleſſed be thou
O Lord our God, King of the whole world, who haſt san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
us by thy commandements, and haſt commanded us to
purge out the old leaven. Then if his houſe be large and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
containing many rooms and ſtories, he cals unto him
ſome boies or others of riper yeares, to help him for to ſearch;
but no women, becauſe they are idle and talkative, and unfit for
ſuch emploiments; these serve as Clerks to say Amen to the
former prayer, and then become fellow-ſeekers to finde out
the leavened bread, every one of theſe carrying a wax light in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40423:99"/>
his hand, holding the ſame to every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that hee may ſee whether any rat or mouſe have left any
crumbs of bread uneaten. He is to lift the light no higher then
his arms will ſtretch; especially in that place where his owne
wall joines to the wall of the houſe of ſome Chriſtian, for in
ſuch a place he is not permitted to ſeek at all; for if the light
ſhould chance to ſhine through the creviſes into the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
houſe, hee might thinke the Jew were about to set the
ſame on fire. Whereſoever the houſe of one Jew adheres un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another, there the ſcrutator for rats and mice, muſt ſearch
in every place, as much as he can poſſible. They muſt uſe no
tallow candles in this their ſcrutinie, for theſe will ſuddenly
melt, and it is to be feared, that the chamber ſhould not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
cleane, but rather defiled by the leaven hereof. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they willingly, and of set purpoſe, caſt oſme cruſts of bread
upon the pavement, eſpecially upon that which they conceive
to bee purified, to the end, that their laborious ſearch and
prayer, may not be in vaine. These cruſts muſt be of great anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and of an hoary hardneſſe, otherwiſe all the fat is in
the fire. The bread which is appointed for them to eat at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
they hide before they begin to ſearch, leſt they ſhould
find this alſo, and ſo be forced to burn it, and by this meanes
it ſhould come to paſſe that they might go ſupperleſſe to bed.
It is not lawfull for any man to ſpeak a word between the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

               <p>So much leaven as they finde, they gather together, and

Upon the morrow of the eve of the paſſeover, they begin

they uſe in kneading their dough, they call <hi>Mitzuah,</hi> or the
water of the commandement, which they draw out of the
wels, poure it into the veſſels of celebration, and carry it home
about the ſetting of the Sunne, the ſtars not yet appearing.
They carry it home covered, for it is not permitted that the
Sunne ſhould ſhine upon this water, for the ſpace of 24 hours
together. For as the Sun ſends out its beames upon the earth
for the ſpace of twelve houres in the day, and cannot with his
raies pierce into the fountaine: So muſt it be covered for the
twelve houres in the night, by which meanes the Sun comes
not at it by the ſpace of a whole naturall day. The Maſter of
the family is bound to draw the water out of the well or pit,
with his owne hands, and never think himſelfe to worthy to
undertake ſuch a busineſs; for it is recorded that in ancient daies,
a certaine King of Iſrael upon a certaine time, tooke the firſt
fruits of the trees, and in his owne perſon carried them upon
his ſhoulders into the garners.</p>
               <p>When they begin to knead the dough, then the Maſter of

hard roſted. A diſh of poſtage is the next ſervice, made with
apples peares nuts, figs, almonds, orenges and ſuch like fruits,
firſt boiled in wine, looking as though they were mixt with
bruiſed bricks. Upon theſe they ſtraw many ſpices, but eſpecially
cinamon ſcarce beaten at all, ſo that this kind of pottage
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40423:102"/>
ſeems to have in them both clay and ſtraw; in remembrance
that their forefathers out of theſe materials, made bricks in
the land of Egypt. Moreover, they grace the table with a ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
made of herbes, of an eager taſte, as, lettice, ivye, raddiſh,
perſley, ſavory, creſſes, and ſuch like. Over againſt which, they
place another diſh full of vinegar, in memory, that their ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
eat the paſchall lambe with bitter herbs. The table being
thus furniſhed, they in great haſt take their place, every one,
old and young, yea the very infant lying as yet in the cradle,
hath a bowle of wine preſented unto him, and then the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the houſe conſecrates the cup, and gives an orderly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to the feaſt: Grace being ſaid, every one takes up his

with his elbow his ſilken pillow, as though hee were ſome

waſh their hands before the giving of thanks, ſome after. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which, many diſputes are extant in the Talmud, and

               <p>Immediately after they have waſhed their throats, they fall

to make their ſtomach give a more plauſible entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the ſucceeding diſhes, it being very ſoveraign for the
invitation of an appetite. To proceed: The Maſter of the
houſhold taking that cake of the three which lyeth in the
middle out of the platter, breaks it in twaine, and putting
the greater part there of under his pillow or napkin (ſignifying
thereby, that their fathers flying out of Egypt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> took their dough
before it was leavened, their kneading troughes being bound
up in their clothes upon their ſhoulders) hee puts the other
halfe into its former place, between the two whole cakes,
throwing the lambes legg roſted, and the egg, out of the other
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40423:102"/>
platter. Then every one laying hands on the diſh wherein is
the halfe cake, ſaith with a loud voice, ſuch was the bread of
affliction, wherewith our fathers were fed in the land of
Egypt. Every one that is hungry, let him come and eat his
fill; whoſoever hath need, let him come and eat of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall
lambe. This yeare we are in this place, the next yeare
we ſhall be in the land of Canaan: This yeare we are ſervants
and bond-men, the next yeare (God ſaying Amen) we ſhall
be redeemed, become Lords and Maſters. (In this place the
halfe cake is an emblem of poverty and exile: The reaſon is, a
poor man or a beggar hath not a whole loaſe in all his houſe,
but only ſcraps and fragments) This their practiſe they ground
upon thoſe words of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 16. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Seven daies thou ſhalt eate unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened

ended, they ſet the lambes legg, and the roſted egg upon the
table againe, and the ſecond time preſent every perſon in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
with a bowle of wine, and take the platter wherein
the cakes are, from the table, that the children may move a

recorded in theſe words, <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod 12. 26, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>that when your

yee ſhall ſay, it is the ſacrifice of the Lords paſſeover, who paſſed
over the houſes of the children of Iſrael in Egypt, when he ſmote
the Egyptians, and delivered our houſes.</hi> So the children of the
Jewes at this day ought to aske their fathers why they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the cakes from the table, before they have taſted of
them, and they are to anſwer them according to the tenor of
theſe words. Inſtantly, upon the ſolution of the objection,
the cakes are the ſecond time ſet upon the table, and then
the whole company ſings a tedious ſong concerning their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
out of the land of Egypt: When they come to that
diviſion, wherein mention is made of the ten plagues of Egypt,
they ſlacke their voice, and with their fingers caſt ſome drops
of wine out of the cup; thereby intimating that theſe ten
plagues being baniſhed out of their doors, ought to fall upon
their enemies the Chriſtians. The ſong being ended every
one taking his cup into his hand, and in a high note ſinging or
saying; It is meet and our bounden duty, that we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
praiſe, glorify, extoll, honour and bleſſe him, who hath
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40423:103"/>
not done not only for our Anceſtors, but for us alſo all theſe
ſignes and wonders, who hath vouchſafed to bring us out of
darkneſſe into light, out of bondage into liberty, out of the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
of ſorrow, into the faire fields of joy and gladneſſe, and
hath changed our daies of mourning and lamentation, into ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Feſtivals, repreſenting a delightfull Jubilee, for this cause
will we come before him, and ſing many hallelujahs to his
holy name; ſitting in his chair like a ſpanish Don newly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by a new faſhion, he carouſes the ſecond bowle. Then
the Maſter of the houſe waſhing his hands, takes the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
cake out of the diſh, and ſaith, Bleſſed be thou O Lord
our God, King of the world, who bringeſt bread out of the
earth; yet not eating thereof, he takes againe the middle cake,
and ſaith, Bleſſed be thou O Lord our God, King of the world,
who haſt ſanctifyed us by thy commandements, and haſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
us to eat unleavened bread. Immediately upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation
of theſe words, he breaks a morſell of both cakes,
and eates it, commanding the reſt to doe likewiſe, who all
leane upon their left ſide. Then they take one whole cake, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the halfe; notwithſtanding that upon the Sabbath
they are accuſtomed onely to the uſe of whole loaves, and the

In the next place the Maſter of the family takes ſome of
the bitter herbes, and puts them into the foreſaid pottage,
ſaying, Bleſſed be thou O Lord God, King of the world, who
haſt commanded us to feed upon bitter herbes; and then hee
invites every one to eat thereof. They doe not now as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
leane upon their pillowes, in remembrance, that their

               <p>Laſtly, he takes the third cake out of the platter, and breaks

               <p>So much concerning the prologue or preparatory acts to
the Supper of the Paſchall lambe; now begins the ſupper it
ſelfe. They eate whatſoever God hath provided, making very
merry, quaffing off, and carouſing whole bowles of wine, and
beer, untill the middle of the night; which approaching, the
Maſſer of the Feaſt takes the halfe cake which he had hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his pillow, eates a little thereof, and reacheth unto every
man preſent a morſell of the ſame: which done, they leane very
demurely upon their left sides, waſh their hands, take a cup
of wine, and drinke it off, which is the third cup by them
bleſſed and conſecrated. At length, thanks being given, the
cups are filled the fourth time, and the good man of the houſe
taking his cup into his hands, ſaith, <hi>poure out thy wrath upon
the Gentiles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 69. 25.</note>

diſpleaſure take hold on them.</hi> In the mean time, one running
to the doore, unlocks it, and ſets it open, thereby willing to
ſhew their great ſecurity. In this ſaying, they curſe all people
which are not of Iſrael, more eſpecially the Chriſtians, hoping
that <hi>Elias</hi> will come that very night, and declare unto them
the comming of their Saviour and deliverer the Meſſias, as they
alſo brag and boaſt in that prayer, called <hi>Azrob niſſim</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">The two firſt words thereof.</note> their
reaſon is, becauſe all thoſe famous deliverances ſo full of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

that <hi>Elias</hi> is come indeed, and is about to take vengean e on

ſaies certaine table-prayers at the period of the ſupper,
which he cloſeth up in this manner: Almighty God build

to reſt, and ſleep in great ſecurity; for they perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that this night neither man nor devil can approach to
doe them any hurt. This night is called in the ſecond book of
<hi>Moſes</hi> and the 12 Chapter, <hi>Lel Schemarim,</hi> the night of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
or preservation. Hereup on their minds being fraugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with ſuch a conceit, they abandon feare, leave open their
gates and doors all the night over, to give an entrance to <hi>Elias</hi>
the Prophet, who as they aſſure themſelves, will come and
deliver them out of this their miſery. Thus the poor blirdfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Jewes trouble and vex themſelves with this their vaine
pompe, and pompous vanity, for two nights together, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of that paſchall lambe which they ought to have eaten,
uſing no other ceremonies, then <hi>Moſes</hi> in the inſtitution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
hath deſcribed. It being the poſition of their Rabbines that
it was not required at their hands, after the deſtruction of
their City and Temple, to Kill and eat the paſchall lambe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ceremonial preſcription of <hi>Meſes</hi> and that they
are not tyed to obſerve theſe or any others by him enjoined,
unleſſe they were in the promiſed land of Canaan which land
alone is to be accounted pure and holy, all others defiled and
profane. Now from theſe premiſes, every one may infer thus
much, that ſeeing the Jewes have not, ſrom that time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the true paſchall lambe Chriſt Jeſus was offered, eaten the
poſſeover in any place according to the right preſcription; and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40423:104"/>
alſo ſeeing the Jewes at this day ſo journing in Jeruſalem, and
the land of Canaan, do not eat the paſchall lamb in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that they ought; neither doe they offer any ſacrifice, it
muſt neceſſarily follow, that there is some other cauſe, why
their ſacrifices are ceaſed, and all other their Moſaicall Rites
and Ceremonies are abrogated, which certainly they might
have found out in the ſpace of 1631 yeares, had they not been
ſmitten with blindneſſe from above. So that now we may ſay
with the Prophet <hi>David, This their may uttereth fooliſhneſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 49. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>yet
their poſterity delight in their talke. But my people would not hear
my voice, and Iſrael would have none of me; ſo I gave them up to
their owne hearts luſts,</hi>

                  <hi>and they have walked in their counſels.</hi> The

<hi>Thou ſhalt therefore ſacrifice the paſſeover unto the

                  <hi>of the flocke and the herd in the place, which the

them (according to their ordinary gloſſe) that they
ſhould not celebrate this Feaſt in any other place, but in the
promiſed land; they doe inferre, that now being diſperſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Nations, they are not lyable to the obſervation of
the ſame. But the true ſence of the words is this; That when
God had put a period to Iſraels captivity, and brought them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the land of promiſe, the land of Canaan, and having given
unto them a ſetled kind of regiment, a City and a Temple in
which it pleaſed him to place his name, then they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire

               <p>It was formerly mentioned, that the Jewes at the ſupper of

why after theſe their cups, they curſe the Chriſtians in a prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
called <hi>Schepoch,</hi> is (according to <hi>Rabbi Bechai</hi> in the foreſaid
place) because God ſhall poure upon the enemies of the Jewes,
the Chriſtians and all others, foure cups of his wrath and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance;
and make them drinke the dregs thereof; as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,<note place="margin">Jer. 25. 15.</note>
                  <hi>Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cauſe all the

beene a golden cup in the Lords hand that hath made all

                  <hi>ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and vapours of ſmoake, this
ſhall be their portion to drinke.</hi> Againe, <hi>There is a cup in the hand
of the Lord, and the wine thereof is red as for the dregs thereof, all
the wicked of the earth ſhall drinke them, and ſuck them out.</hi> If the
Jewes could rightly weigh and ponder the ſcope of theſe
words and parallell them with other places of holy writ, they
might eaſily finde, that this cup is in the firſt place filled for
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40423:105"/>
them, according to that which is written by the Prophet,
ſaying, <hi>I took the cup at the Lords hand, and made all the nations to
drinke, to whom the Lord had ſent me: To wit, Jeruſalem, and the
Cities of Judah, and the Kings thereof, to make them a deſolation,
and an aſtoniſhment, an hiſſing and a curſe as it is this day; Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh
King of Egypt, and his ſervants, his Princes and his people.</hi>
When therefore the Jewes have drunk off, and digeſted this
fearfull cup, they will have but a ſlender ſtomack to reach it
out unto the Chriſtians. From all that hath been ſaid, we may
conclude, that the Jewes keep not the paſſeover according to
<hi>Moſes</hi> his inſtitution, and Gods command, but according to
the traditions of the Rabbines; which with them are in farre
greater account, then the commanements of God, as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent

the flame comes to the water, it may be extinguiſhed; for it is
a hainous wickedneſſe to cut off that part of the candle with a

               <p>A Jew is not permitted to invite any Chriſtian upon any

               <p>It is alſo lawfull to weep upon the Sabbath, even to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating

which will not admit of teares for a joint companion. If any

thread the needle the day before. The platters which are uſed

the Feaſt endures; but as for hens and geeſe, and others which

               <p>At eventide they returne into the Synagogue for to pray,
which they doe with ſo great haſt, as though they were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
their enemies in flight; the reaſon is becauſe they are
to boile their meat after evening prayer, which they are to
eat at ſupper. The day following they celebrate with the ſame
pompe and ſolemnity, that they did the former, becauſe then
they are uncertaine which is the firſt day of the new moon in
March, and conſequently which is the fourteenth thereof. The
celebration therefore of the Feaſt of the Paſſeover, holds for
the ſpace of two daies together, that they may not commit
an error in the keeping thereof. If any one chance in theſe two
daies to finde any leaven in his houſe, he muſt cover it with
a diſh or platter, and the day following to burn it. If any have
ducks, hens geeſe, or doves about his houſe, he muſt caſt the
corne wherewith hee feeds them in a wet place, for if ſome
ſhould be left, and it ſhould chance to encreaſe, hee is held
guilty of sowing graine upon the Sabbath day.</p>
               <p>Next after theſe in order follow four other daies, which are
only halfe holy daies, and are called by the name of common-Feſtivals,
upon which they may do ſome workes but not all;
which is alſo much diſputed, and the queſtion ſtated in <hi>Orach
chajim;</hi> as for inſtance: It is lawfull to do thoſe things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this day which being undone are ſubject to periſh and alſo
ſome dammage may follow thereupon; as the milking of kine,
and ſuch like, It is permitted to cut the haire of a young man,
which is denied to an old one. He that hath but one ſhirt may
waſh it ſo that he doe it in private; and the mother may alſo
waſh the childrens clouts; to ſmooth their linnen and collars;

works he may lawfully undergoe, ſo that the manner of doing
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40423:107"/>
may be ſomewhat ſingular, that a difference may bee put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the labours of the weeke and the Feſtivall. Amongſt
other things, many have allowed the paring of nailes as upon
theſe daies; but the moſt religious among them, ſeeing it to be
a matter of great difficulty, have onely permitted women,
which are to purge themſelves by waſhing from their unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
to practiſe it; for they are bound upon the day of their
purification, to cut the nailes of their hands and feet, leſt
ſome impure thing might lurke under them.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh day of the Feſtivall is holy, according to the
Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> wherein it is written, <hi>The firſt day ſhall bee
holy unto you, in it you ſhall doe no manner of worke, except that
which every man muſt eate, that onely may be done of you.</hi> Upon
this day they repaire to the Synagogue, to offer up their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and evening ſacrifice of prayer and thanksgiving: Taking
the booke of the Law in a pompous manner, and putting
the ſame into the Arke againe, boaſting thereof in a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
manner; and becauſe they are uncertaine which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day, therefore they hallow with an equall celebration,
the ſeventh and eighth; which time expired, they bring againe
leavened bread into their houſes, that God may ſee that they
obey his commandements, and ſtretch out the Feaſt no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then he hath enjoned. After this, the men muſt faſt for
three daies, two Mundaies, and one Thurſday. That if any
one have drunke too much in the time of the Feaſt, or have
any other way profaned it, he may doe pennance for the fact.
For thirty daies after the paſſeover, the Jewes carry foule wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their face, are very ſorrowfull, make no marriages, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cutting their haire, nor going into any bath: And that
for the ſake of <hi>Akibha,</hi> an excellent and learned Rabbine who
had 24 thouſand ſchollars, who all dyed beeween Eaſter and
Pentecoſt, becauſe one emulated and envied, deſpiſed, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
detracted another, not any way exhibiting those debts
of love and honour, to the paiment of which they are lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
All the foreſaid perſons dyed in the night time, and were
buried by the women; for which cauſe they ceaſe from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
at Sunne ſet, and hallow the night following. Upon
the thirty third day after the paſſeover, the Jewes have a
great ſolemnity; cut their beards, bath themſelves, feaſt and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:40423:108"/>
make merry, becauſe the daies of mourning for Akibha'<hi>s ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers

the firſt; promiſing unto God that upon the grant hereof, they
will duely celebrate this Feſtivall, and all other, uſing all the
ſacrifices and ceremonies required as neceſſary, and preſcribed
in the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That they ſhould take ſuch an exact account of the number
of theſe daies, or the Feaſt of ſeven weeks, or harveſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as they write, was the command of God himſelfe, leſt his
children ſhould forget this Feaſt, and ſo neglect the payment
of their firſt ſruits to God at Jeruſalem, which might eaſily
come to paſſe, ſeeing while they were yet in their owne land,
about or in the time of the celebration of this Feſtivall, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one was buſied about his rurall affaires, and compelled to
looke about his harveſt busineſſe.</p>
               <p>This Feaſt of weekes, is by them compared to a certaine
King, who comming into a City where ſome Prince or Noble
Peere is fettered in the priſon-houſe, entreats the Magiſtrate
for his releaſe, which is granted accordingly, ſo many weeks
being paſt and gone. And moreover hath this added unto his
liberty, that this time being paſt, he will alſo give him his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in marriage. Then the Captaine begins to reckon every
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40423:109"/>
houre, day and week, which the King hath deſigned unto him.
So God dealt with the Iſraelites while they were yet in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
to the Egyptians; ſaying unto them, I will bring you out
of Egypt with a ſtretched out arme, therefore you ſhall number
uunto your ſelves ſeven weeks aſter the Feaſt of the Paſſeover:
which time being fully paſt, I will give you my holy daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the Law, to wife. But from which the Jewes have now
gone a whoring, and are become moſt vile adulterers, as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
and the reſt of the Prophets complaine.</p>
               <p>The Jewiſh women are not bound to this computation, as
alſo they are not to many other precepts, to which the men
are lyable. Upon the evening of this Feſtivall, it is not lawfull
for any man to uſe phlebotomy; for they write in their Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagin
or Talmud, that on the eve of this Feaſt in time past, there
blowed a certaine evill and peſtilent winde, which they call
<hi>Tabhoach,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tract de Sab. cap. 18.</note> which ſignifies a robber or butcher, which had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied
all the children of Iſrael, had they not been willing to
have received the Law, which God was about to deliver unto
them the day following. They keep this Feaſt for two daies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
by reaſon of the ſame doubt which was frmerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
in their minds, about the celebration of the Paſſeover.
In the celebration hereof, they uſe not many ceremonies,
becauſe it is not lawfull for them to ſacrifice. They take the
book of the Law twice our of the Arke, calling out five men,
who reade ſome certaine Chapters and Sections of the Law,
the contents whereof are concerning the ſacrifices, and other
rites, which were in uſe with their Anceſtours in the time of
this Feſtivall. Furthermore, they ſtraw their pavements and
floores of their houſes, ſtreets and Synag ogues, with ruſhes,
in remembrance of the Law, which was given as upon this day:
Sticking alſo every corner of the houſe with green houghes,
enriching their browes with crowns of ivy, hereby ſignifying,
that all the places about mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> were greene when the
Law was given. Moreover, they eat many diſhes made with
milke, as cuſtards, and fritters, or ſuch like, either baked
or fryed and that becauſe the Law upon the day when it was
given, was as white, pure and ſweet as any milk. Among the
reſt, they make one principall wafer or junket, deep and thick,
with ſeven ſeverall partitions, calling it the cuſtard or junket of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:40423:109"/>
mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> This ſame is to put them in remembrance of the
ſeventh heaven, into which the Lord aſcended from mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai.</hi>
Laſtly, every one is bound to have his table well furniſhed

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE third great Feſtivall of the Jewes, which
they are to celebrate every yeare once, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
before the Lord in Jeruſalem, is the
Feaſt of Tabernacles, concerning which, as
alſo the two former, it is writ in the fifth
book of <hi>Moſes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 16. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Three times a yeare ſhall all
thy males appeare before the Lord thy God, in the place which he
ſhall chuſe, in the Feaſt of unleavened bread, in the Feaſt of weeks;
and in the Feaſt of Tabernacles; and they ſhall not appeare before
the Lord empty.</hi> The time of the celebration of this Feaſt, was
according to Gods owne commandement to bee the fifteenth
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40423:110"/>
day of the ſeventh month, according to the vulgar account,
beginning to reckon from the firſt day of the new yeare of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals,
of which we have ſpoken formerly, that it begins in
March, and ſo conſequently inferre, that this ſeventh month
muſt be our September: The etymologie whereof as alſo the
reaſon why this month in their common annuall account, is
called the firſt, ſhall hereafter be more at large declared.</p>
               <p>The end of their keeping of this Feaſt, was as a ſigne or
token, whereby the Iſraelites might recall to mind, the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
providence of Almighty God, by which hee had ſuſtained
the children of Iſrael, after a wonderfull manner, for the ſpace
of forty yeares in the deſert, having neither houſe nor harbor.</p>
               <p>The manner of celebration is thus preſcribed by <hi>Moſes; You
ſhall dwell in boothes ſeven daies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lev. 23</note> 
                  <hi>all that are Iſraelites born ſhall
dwell in boothes, that your generations may know that I made the
children of Iſrael to dwell in boothes, when I brought them out of
the land of Egypt.</hi> These boothes were wont to be made of the
boughes of goodly trees; as, the mirtle, olive, firre, which by
reaſon of their fatneſſe, would for a long time retaine their
green attire; branches of palm trees, boughes of thicke trees,
willowes of the brook, as it is in the ſame place. This they put
in practise in the daies of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> after their returne from
Babylon; for it is recorded, that then they publiſhed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
in all their Cities,<note place="margin">Neh. 8. 15, 16.</note> and in Jeruſalem, ſaying, <hi>Goe forth
unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, pine branches, myrtle
branches, and palme branches, and branches of thicke trees to make
boothes: And they did ſo.</hi> From that which hath been ſaid, we
may gather, 1. That the Jewes in ancient times, made Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of theſe kinds of boughes, in which they dwelt for the
ſpace of eight daies. 2. That there were in uſe for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,
more then foure ſeverall kinds of boughes or branches;
yea the willowes of the brook are not mentioned in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
place of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> which were uſed for the knitting
together of the other branches, being plyable, and fit for that
purpoſe; Therefore the Jewes of theſe preſent times; commit
a groſſe error, that they in a moſt ſuperſtitious manner in the
celebration of this Feſtivall, tie and confine themſelves to
thoſe foure kinds of branches only mentioned by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and
not building them Tabernacles therewithall, but transferring
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:40423:110"/>
them to another uſe, of which more hereafter.</p>
               <p>Concerning this Feaſt, there is extant a large tract in the
Talmud, wherein the genuine obſervation and celebration
thereof is ſet downe; the plat‐forme of the boothes or Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles
exquisitely drawne; the uſe of the foure ſeverall ſorts of
branches deſcribed, with much diſputation, and great ſubtilty,
as their manner is, not omitting to handle all the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
belonging there unto; yet never ſeeking after the true way
and meanes, whereby they may rightly lift up their hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the God of their fathers: For though in the time of this
Feaſt they ſay many prayers, yet they offer them up unto the
Lord, only upon the censure of their tongue, not upon the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
of their hearts, for in theſe they are far from him; an
evident demonſtration hereof, is the winged hudling over of
theſe their petitions, uſing ſuch a precipitancy of ſpeech, as
though they were able to pronounce a thouſand words with
one breath, and accounting it a work of art and skill ſo to do.
This Feaſt endures for the ſpace of eight daies; the two firſt, and
the two laſt whereof, are to be kept holy altogether; thoſe
which are of the middle rank, only for halfe the day. Upon the
fourteenth day of the month, about eventide, they meet in
the Synagogue, according to their eccleſiaſtical Ordinances and
inſtitutions, where they ſing and pray untill it bee night. At
which time they returne to their houſes, and retire themſelves
into their Tabernacles, where the Maſter of the family ſaith a
certaine prayer, which ſerves for the initiation of the Feaſt,
and conſecration of the Tabernacles, giving thanks unto God,
that he hath choſen them before all other people, exalted, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
and commanded them to dwell in Tabernacles. The
thanks giving being ended, they fall to ſupper, where they are
very jocund and merry. In ancient daies they were wont alſo
to lodge in their boothes, which the Jewes at this day uſe not;
the coldneſſe, moiſtneſſe, and other maladies and incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which might accrew unto them thereby, being as ſo many
potent arguments to diſſwade from this, and to invite them to
their owne bed‐chambers, which experience hath taught them
to be the ſweeter reſting place. Upon the morrow of the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
day, they returne into the Synagogue ſinging and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:40423:111"/>
and honouring the Lord with a little lip-ſervice, their
hearts roving quite another way.</p>

in his leſt, ſaith, Bleſſed be thou, O Lord our God, King of the
world who haſt ſanctifyed us by thy commandments and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us to carry a bundle of branches: Which while he is in
repeating, he ſhakes the bundle, that it may make a noiſe;
the words of the Prophet moving him thereunto; who ſaith,
<hi>The trees of the wood ſhall clap their hands.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 69. 12.</note> Then he ſhakes the
bundle three times towards the Eaſt, three times towards
the Weſt, three times towards the North, three times towards
the South, heaving it alſo in the laſt place, over his head,
then ſuffering it to becke unto the ground: In all theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
poſtures, carrying himſelfe much like unto a fencer, in
the toſſing, advancing, and ſhouldering of his pike. Then
they pray againe, and againe begin to ſhake their bundle of
boughes, thereby giving to underſtand, that they are trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
conquerours of all ſinne and inquity, having a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
that by the noiſe of their branches, they have ſo laſhed,
whipped away, and terrifyed the devill, that hee dare never
any more presume to accuſe them before God for their ſinnes
and offences.</p>
               <p>The next thing they put in practice is concerning the Book
of the Law, which ſome or other goes and takes out of the

fruitfull yeare. For the firſt day of this month, is the firſt day of
the new yeare of yeares, properly so called, according to which
they frame the computation of their yeares. In the morning
of every one of theſe daies, they early waſh themſelves in

many candles, ſing and pray <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ervently, and with a great deale
of oſtentation,<note place="margin">In <hi>Poland</hi> they take out all, though they be a thouſand.</note> take ſeven books of the Law out of the Arke,
and lay them upon the pew or deske, which, as was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
related, they compaſſe about ſeven times, having their
bundles of palme branches in their hands, which are knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with willow: After every ſeverall encompaſſing, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
one of the ſeven books of the Law, into the Arke againe;
<hi>Rambam Rakanat</hi> and <hi>Bechai,</hi> with many other of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,
Commenting upon the 14 Chapter of the 4 book of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> bluſh not to affirm, that God upon the ſeventh day at
night, reveales unto them by the moone, what thing ſoever
ſhall befall them the yeare following; and that in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Upon this night they goe out into the fields by moone-ſhine,
ſome with their heads uncovered; other having onely a
linnen cloth tied about them, or a vaile upon them, which they
ſuffering to fall upon the earth, ſtretch out their armes and
hands. If any mans ſhadow in the moon-ſhine ſeem to want an
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40423:112"/>
head, it is a certaine ſigne and token, that ſuch a one ſhall that
yeare either loſe his head, or dye ſome other death. If any
ſeem to want a ſinger, it preſages the death of ſome of his
friends, if his right hand, of his ſon, if his left, of his daughter.
But if no ſhadow at all appeare, then that man ſhall undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
dye, and therefore if he have appointed a journey, hee
ſhould hereby bee warned to let it alone, leſt he ſhould not
returne in ſafety. This the Rabbines prove from thoſe words
of <hi>Moſes, Their ſhadow is departed from them, Num.</hi> 14. 9. The
Rabbines interpreting that a ſhadow, which properly ſignifies
a defence; Yet they ſay, that though a man cannot behold his
ſhadow as upon this night, that for this reaſon he ſhould not
ceaſe to be of the Jewiſh religion. Furthermore, they write that
God at this time definitely ſets down, how much it ſhal rain all
the year after; &amp; then to decree, whether the year ſhal be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

find an occaſion to return to their own houſes; which thing
they doe ſo ſoon as the night is come. When they goe out of
the Tabernacles the moſt of them are wont to ſay, O would to
God he would vouchſafe that we might dwell in this manner
in the Tabernacles of the Leviathan in time to come, thereby
wiſhing (as I conjecture) that they may bee admitted to
eate of that great fiſh Leviathan, in the daies of the Meſſias.</p>

                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:40423:113"/>
It is recorded in their Minhagin, that the cauſe why they
are bound for the ſpace of ſeven daies to dwell in Tabernacles,
is to put them in remembrance of the pillar of the cloud under
the ſhadow whereof they went out of the land of Egypt; which
cloud was like unto a Tabernacle, which received the darts and
arrowes, that they ſhould not hurt the Iſraelites. 2. They
ſay that God would have them to dwell in Tabernacles, that
by their ſhelter, they may be defended and ſhrouded from the
vehemency of the Sunnes heate, and violence of weather. And
although they went out of Egypt the fifteenth day of March,
yet God commanded them to build Tabernacles and booths,
and to dwell in them in September, not in March, otherwiſe it
had not been eſteemed for a Feſtival ordained by Gods eſpeciall
command, becauſe in the month of March, they might build
them, onely to avoid the heate; but in September no ſuch cauſe
can be pretended, being a very cold ſeaſon. Hence wee may
conclude, that the Jewes do at this time dwell in booths by
Gods injunction.</p>
               <p>The place where they are to pitch theſe Tabernacles, it
ought to be pleaſant, and fragrant in ſmell. Whence it comes
to paſſe, that Jewes ſtreet in <hi>Frankeford</hi> upon the Maene, is
the pleaſanteſt, comelieſt, and neateſt in all the City. Moreover,
they are to be built in ſome open place, not in a cloiſter or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſome cover. When they ſit therein, they muſt not ſhut
their doores, though both wind and raine moleſt them. The
materials of their booths are to be green boughs, not tiles or
boards, ſo cloſely compacted together, that it is not poſſible
for them to ſee the ſtars through them. They of the richer ſort
are wont to ſpread the floors with coverings of the beſt, ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their tops with divers fruits, as orenges, apples, and the
like; which if they ſeem to be too deare they commonly uſe
cucumbers in their place. Maids, women, and ſervants, are not
tyed to remaine in the Tabernacles, being not lyable to the
obſervance of any command, which binds a man to a certaine
place. Froſt, raine or ſnow, ought not to ſorce them out of
theſe manſions; yet if it chance to raine out of meaſure, then
they depart them with great ſorrow and expreſſion of griefe, thinking that God is angry with them, and not willing that
they ſhould at that time obſerve and put his commandements
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:40423:113"/>
in execution; much like to ſome great Lord or Peer, who bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

take <hi>pri etz hadar,</hi> fruits of goodly trees as they need, as it is
without all doubt, that the word <hi>pri</hi> in this place ſignifies
not fruits, but boughes in generall, whether they beare any
fruit or not, of which they ought to make their Tabernacles,
as will eaſily appeare, if we compare this place with thoſe fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Nation, do every yeare goe thither, and buy great abundance

Jewes doe ſo journe making them pay ſowrely for them; for
I have seen an orenge ſold in September for four <hi>Florens.</hi>

the adorning of theſe their Tabernacles, and it is a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
or dialogue which God ſhal have with al people at the

or of Idolatry: In theſe words. At the laſt day God ſhall
ſay, that onely the Jewes are juſt and holy, as they who
have fulfilled the Law of God, in every part and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
but all other people of the earth are ungodly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,

deſtruction and damnation, reputed as a laughing ſtocke

Wherefore they commonly faſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of their chief Rabbines repeating a

after him as followeth. Bleſſed be
thou, O Lord God, our God, King
of the World, who haſt ſanctified us

to the Moon to renew her ſelf by her often change, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
is as a beautiful Crown, and a great ornament unto
the head of every one that is in his mothers womb, even to
all the Iſraelites (as ſaith the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi>) who ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new

leap three times upwards towards heaven; the higher the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
is, the better it is in eſteem: Then they go on, ſaying,

I cannot but here inſert a certain Dialogue ſet down in the
Talmud,<note place="margin">Cholm. cap. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 16.</note> between God and the Moon, which <hi>Rabbi Sim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 12. 6.</note>
the ſon of <hi>Pazzai</hi> thus relates. It is written, <hi>God made two
great lights, the greater to rule the day, the leſſe to rule the
night.</hi> Then ſaid the Moon unto God; O Lord of the whole
world, tell me, I pray thee, Can two Kings reign together,
and wear one and the ſame Crown? To whom God made
anſwer, and ſaid, Go hence and leſſen thy ſelf: She replies;
O my Creator, ſhall I therefore be leſſened, becauſe I have
ſpoken before thee that which is true and right? Then ſaid
God, Go and bear rule and dominion both by day and
night. But quoth the Moon, What great honour ſhall I reap
from hence? or what dignity ſhall accrew thereby? A burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:40423:116"/>
Candle at noontide, what doth it profit? Then the Lord
bids her be gone, ſaying, that the people of Iſrael ſhould
number their dayes, times, and ſeaſons, according to her
courſe and motion, which ſhe denies as impoſſible; for to
this end they ought to have an exact knowledge of the two
<hi>Tekuphoth</hi> or Tropicks, as alſo of the two Solſtices, as it is
written, <hi>They ſhall be for ſignes, and times, and dayes, and years.</hi>
Then God makes her this anſwer, Go thy way, for many
great and learned men ſhall take unto them this thy title, as
<hi>James</hi> the leſs, <hi>Samuel</hi> the leſs, <hi>David</hi> the leſs. But all this
cannot appeaſe her: which when he perceived, he ſaid, offer
a propitiatory ſacrifice for me, becauſe that I have leſſened
the Moon.<note place="margin">Rab. Bechoci.</note> And hereupon <hi>Rabbi Simeon</hi> the ſon of <hi>Sakis</hi>
ſaith, How much doth that Goat differ from others, which
is offered in the time of the new Moon, of which the Lord
ſaid, this ſhall be a propitiatory ſacrifice for me, who have
offended in leſſening the Moon. So far the Talmudiſt. The
Rabbines diverſly diſpute what is the true ſence and meaning
hereof. They who are of ancient dayes are of opinion, that
at the beginning the Sun and Moon were equal in light,
which they prove out of the words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>God
made two great lights.</hi> But ſo ſoon as the Moon murmured
againſt God, and would ſit as Queen, and ſuffer none to
ſhare in dominion with her, but be ſole Monarch in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial
Orbs, God debaſed her for her pride, takes away her
own light, and ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are, ſay they, thoſe immediately following words of <hi>Moſes, The greater light for the government of the day: and the leſſer
light for the government of the night:</hi> whereas he formerly
made no ſuch difference, but ſimply ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ling them two great
lights. And furthermore, that God hearing the Moon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of this her hard uſage and miſ-hap, repented of that he
had done, and cauſed a propitiatory ſacrifice to be offered for
this his offence at every new Moon. This opinion the modern
Rabbines reject as a blaſphemy againſt God, conſidering that
he is juſt and cannot commit iniquity, neither is any wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
found with him. Wherefore they have very much tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

                  <hi>Rabbi Iochamen</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Tract: Roſch haſchanah. c. 1. p. 16.</note> that at new-years-tide three books
are opened: one for them who are extreamly wicked and
ungodly, as Atheiſts and lnfidels: another for them who are
juſt in a moſt perfect manner, the third and laſt for them who
are betwixt both in an indifferent manner, godly and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
who have done as much good as evil. Thoſe who are
perfectly juſt have their names preſently regiſtred in the book
of life: but they who are extremely wicked, have their
names written in the book of death. Thoſe of the middle
ſort are deferred, and put off untill the day of reconciliation,
which is the tenth day after the celebration of the feaſt of the
new year. If they truly and ſincerely repent them of their
ſins in the mean time, ſo that their good deeds exceed their
bad ones, then it goes well with them, but if on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
their evil deeds be more in number: then they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
put in the catalogue of the reprobate and damned.
As it is written,<note place="margin">Pſal. 69. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living,
and not be written among the juſt.</hi> By the <hi>blotting out of the
book</hi> underſtanding the book of the wicked, and by the word
<hi>life</hi> or <hi>living</hi> the book of the juſt, and by the words <hi>Let
them not be written among the juſt,</hi> the book of thoſe who are
indifferently honeſt. Hence is alſo that of <hi>Ralig;bbi Nalig;chman</hi>
the ſon of <hi>Iſaac</hi> upon theſe words of Moſes,<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>Now if thou
wilt palig;rdon their ſin thy mercy ſhall appear: But if thou wilt
not, blot me out of the book which thou haſt written.</hi> In which
words. <hi>Blot out,</hi> fingers out the book of the wicked. <hi>Out
of thy book</hi> the book of the juſt. <hi>Which thou haſt written,</hi>
the book of them which are indifferently juſt and godly. So
far the Talmud. 1. Now that God ſhould at this time ſit
in judgment rather then at any other, the reaſon is grounded
upon a certain tradition of the Antients that God created the
whole world, <hi>Adam,</hi> and placed him in Paradiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the
moneth of September: therefore it was thought very meet
and juſt that God at the years end ſhould require of man an
account of his life, and ſee how he hath carried himſelf for
the ſpace of the year paſt, and ſo reward every one according
to his works. Which he paies unto every one in the year
following in this manner.</p>
               <p>Sins are of divers ſorts, ſome God puniſhes in this world,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:40423:118"/>
ſome alſo in the life to come: ſo alſo good works, ſome
whereof are recompenced here, ſome hereafter. Now if a
man for the moſt part doe nothing els but ſin all the year
long, polluting his ſoul with the horrid filth of wickedneſs,
yet doing ſome few good deeds: the ſum of all is preſented
before Gods tribunal upon new-years day. 1. Then God
takes the ſcales and puts his good deeds in one end, and his
bad deeds in another: If it ſeem good then to the Judge of
all men to reward the foreſaid man for the good he hath
found in him in this preſent world, it cometh to paſs that he
is called a juſt man, and hath this happy ſentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
upon him in this vale of miſery, that he ſhall have a
name in the book of life, live for the next year, become rich
and ſhall be advanced to great honours. 1. In like manner if
an honeſt and juſt man, who every day makes a conſcience of
his wayes, and lives according to the law all the year through,
offend and commit ſome groſs enormities, for which God is
pleaſed to puniſh him in this world, then God calls him a
wicked and unjuſt liver, and pronounceth ſentence againſt
him for evil and not for good, puts his name into the book
of the dead, thereby giving him notice that he ſhall either
die or become poor, or be troubled with ſome dangerous
diſeaſe the year following, and therefore although a man may
enjoy the happineſs of Saints in the world to come, yet
may he be called with injuſtice in this, ſeeing he is here
puniſhed for his offences even as the reprobate. And on the
contrary, one here accounted juſt and holy, may be ordained
to damnation, becauſe God gives him the reward of his
workes in this preſent world. And therefore no man ought
to wonder or account it a ſtrange thing that the godly ſuffer
affliction and all manner of diſtreſs in this preſent life, when
on the contrary the wicked lives as he liſt, gives reſt unto his
ſoule, enjoyes pleaſure, and is without the gunſhot of ſorrow
and vexation: yet at the day of death the caſe is altered, for
he that was here ſo gay and gallant, muſt goe into everlaſting
fire, and the other, ſo miſerable into enternal bliſs. God then
paying unto them the due reward of their labours. And this
is the very reaſon why the <hi>Germara</hi> affirms, that the three
foreſaid books are opened upon new-years day. Furthermore
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40423:118"/>
it often falls out that one good work blots out a number of
tranſgreſſions: and one ſin aboliſheth many good works,
both which are in the power of God. If the ſinner, whoſe
name is put into the book of death, repent him of his wayes
from the bottom of his heart; and continue in this courſe
unto the day of reconciliation, being the tenth of the new-year,
he may happily moue God to reverſe the ſentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
againſt him, and to transferr him into the book of
life. Even as the godly in the ſame ſpace angering his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
by the commiſſion of ſome hainous offence, may move
him to blot his name out of the book of life, and to write it
among the dead. Thus the blindfolded Jews write, ſpeak,
and are conceited of the Almighties rule and government,
making him a Judge of that ſtampe and quality which they
deſire him to be of; far contrary to the deſcription of the
Prophet <hi>David,</hi> who in heavie cheer praying unto God for
the forgiveneſs of his ſins,<note place="margin">Pſal. 143. 2.</note> cries out; <hi>Enter not into judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with thy ſervant O Lord, for no man living ſhall be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in thy ſight.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 130. 3.</note> And again, <hi>If thou O Lord marke whalig;t is done
amiſs, who is able to abide it?</hi> Seeing therefore God ſits in
judgment upon every new-years-day, and ſo ſeverely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the tranſgreſſors of his commandements:<note place="margin">Orach. Chaymna: 581.</note> the Rabbines
have made it an Ordinance and Statute in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that every
one ſhould for a moneth before repent of his ſins and the evil
he hath committed, turn from his wicked wayes, and begin
to lead a new life. This therefore the Jews put in execution,
and upon the firſt day of <hi>Elul</hi> or Auguſt, they fall to a ſerious
account, calling all their ſins to remembrance, and weighing
them according to every ſeveral circumſtance, in which they
have wickedly tranſgreſſed through the whole circuit of the
year. Whoſoever then every day before he eat or drink
queſtions his ſoule, what it hath done? and with a diligent
ſcrutinie ſearches every corner of his heart for ſome formerly
practiſed wickedneſs, grieving very much, and being very
heartily ſorry for the ſame, he ſhall upon New-years-day,
when others are to give an account for their offences, receive
a plenary abſolution. And hence it is that the Jews dwelling
among the Walloones, at this day have a cuſtome to riſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
morning of this moneth before the ſun be up, ſay their
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40423:119"/>
prayers and beg pardon for the ſins which they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
The Jews of Germanie alſo uſe to doe the like ſome foure
dayes at leaſt before the feaſt of the new-year: moreover, they
meet every morning and evening through the whole moneth
in the Synagogue, ſounding a rams horn, not that they are
ſo commanded by <hi>Moſes:</hi> but yet in remembrance of him,
who when he went the ſecond time into the mount to fetch
the tables of the law, commanded a horne to be blowen that
the people ſhould take notice hereof and not tranſgreſs and
ſay,<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſe and make us Gods which may goe before us: as for
this</hi> Moſes <hi>which brought us forth out of the land of Egypt we do
not know what is become of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, they blow the rams horn, that every one may
ſeriously ponder and weigh the laſt judgment, and be terrified
with the meditation hereof: that they may be affrighted and

King makes ſome of his ſervants to blow a trumper, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
watchman may keep diligent watch, and be ready armed
at a moments warning, becauſe the enemy approacheth: So
it is needful for the Jews in the moneth of Auguſt, which
is as herauld to the new year, to ſound the Rams hornes for
to warn every man to repent him of his wickedneſs, that they
may more eaſily reſiſt their enemy, Sin.</p>

when they are to ſay many prayers, whereupon it comes
to paſs, that though they make great haſte in the ſaying of
their prayers, yet they commit no offence therein, becauſe
their guts are not crammed and full ſtuft, which would be a
great hinderance to the ſpeedy gallop of their tongue in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting

who would be accounted more holy then other doe faſt, and
that in imitation of a King, who impoſes a great tribute upon

commands payment to be made. He being yet ten miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

another thirds. When he comes neerer to the City, then
yong and old flock about him and beſpeak his Grace in the
ſame language: The king then moved by the multitude of
petitioners forgives the whole ſum. In like manner God the
King of all the earth willing to make Iſrael give an account of
their life paſt, and of all the ſins by them committed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
yea, enjoynes every one to give ſatisfaction in his own

faſt the Eve of this feſtival, and the Lord to recompence
them remits unto them the third part of their ſins and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
It is therefore enacted, that they of the better ſort ſhould

muſt likewiſe faſt upon the day of reconciliation (of which
day more hereafter) and then God will forgive unto them all
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:40423:120"/>
their ſins, and grant them a pardon for the ſame. Morning
prayer being ended, they goe out of the Synagogue into the
place where they bury their dead: thereby ſignifying that
unleſs God will be pleaſed to pardon their ſins, they are no
better then they who are dead and laid in their grave.<note place="margin">The papiſts had their praying to Saints from hence.</note> They
therefore pray unto God to have mercy on them, and that

               <p>Midday being paſt, the men ſend for the barber, and

               <p>While the Jews are a purifying their bodies, and ſtand
even up to the ears in cold water, then they make confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of every one of which, the confeſſor beats his breſt,
and then hides his body in the water, craving ſo much
courteſie of his fellow as to bear him witneſs. Where
they are neer no rivers, they dig a well in their cellar or

               <p>This computation they ground upon the time of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the world, which was as, they affirm, upon the firſt
of September. Soe that they now reckon the years from

This firſt day of September is to be ſanctified and
kept holy by the Jews, being a thing commanded by God
himſelf; ſaying, Speak unto the children of Iſrael and ſay,
<hi>In the ſeventh moneth in the firſt day of the moneth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Levit. 23. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall you
have a Sabbath, for the remembrance of blowing the trumpets,
an holy convocation. Ye ſhall do no ſervile work therein, but
offer ſacrifice made by fire unto the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though <hi>Moſes</hi> make no mention of the new-year in
theſe words, yet following an ancient tradition of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors,
they begin their civil year as upon this day, being
the firſt of September, which is the ſeventh moneth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
from March, in which begins the new-year of their
feſtivals. The chief reaſon why it is called the feaſt of
trumpets, is, becauſe the Prieſts in old time were wont as this
day to repair to the Temple, and blow upon trumpets, that
hereby the people might be warned, and pricked forward to
render thanks unto God with a chearful and merry heart, for
the bleſſings and favours plentifully powred upon them in the
year laſt paſt: that he hath preſerved them in ſafety, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
their ſouls from death; and that with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
truly repenting them of their miſled life, they may
appear before God upon the day of reconciliation, upon
which an attonement is to be made between God and his
people. The Jews at this day inſtead of a trumpet uſe a
Rams horn, the reaſon whereof ſhall hereafter be related.
The manner of the Celebration followeth.</p>
               <p>After evening prayer, they begin the feaſt by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration
of a bowl of wine, and a certain prayer appointed
for the day, they account it as a ſigne of good luck if their
wine be new and ſweet. Every one ſalutes his fellow with
<hi>God ſend you a good new-year,</hi> or pointing to the books of
which we made mention in the former chapter, they ſay,
<hi>Thou art regiſtred for one who ſhall be partaker of a proſperous</hi>
year, to whom the other makes anſwer, <hi>and you alſo:</hi> that
is as much as if he had ſaid, The Greator of heaven and
earth hath ordained thee for a good new-year. The little
children run unto the chief Rabbine, and aske him bleſſing,
upon whom he laies his hands and prayes unto God to ſend
them an happy year.</p>

From the Synagouge to their own houſes,<note place="margin">Orach chaijm. num. 583.</note> where they finde
the table neatly ſpread, and ſumptuouſly furniſhed, and that
with no ſmall deal of proviſion. They preſently fall aboard:
the firſt diſh whereupon they make an aſſault, is a Platter full
of dainty Apples ſteeped in Honey, of which every one taſting
a bit, ſaith, God ſend us a merry New-year, then proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with great jollity and mirth to the ſtuffing of their empty
guts. Amongſt other things, the fore-mentioned Rams-horn
is laid upon the table, in remembrance of the Ram which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
catched in the thickets, was ſacrificed by <hi>Abraham</hi> in
the place of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Others write that they lay it upon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to ſignifie, that they ſhall become the head, and not the

<hi>Lord ſhall make thee head, and not the tail, and thou ſhalt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

unto the Jews, but with that condition to keep all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
to obſerve and do them. But they understood a
maſtery and dominion over the Chriſtians to be the tenor
thereof; which that it may come to paſs they daily pray to
God above.</p>
               <p>They eat fiſh for the most part of the beſt ſort they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
upon this night: to ſhew, that their good works &amp; merits
ſhall multiply and increase even as the fiſhes in the ſea. Fruits
of all kinds are no novelty unto them; as Almonds, Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
Grapes, Gourds, Leeks, Lupines, ſweet, yet groſſe
pulſe, and such like. The Leeks repreſent their enemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they ſhall be rooted out of the earth and periſh utterly;
for the Leek in the Chaldee tongue is called <hi>Crate,</hi> which is
derived from a Verb ſignifying to <hi>Cut:</hi> and hereupon when
they have eaten their Leeks, they ſay, Let all our enemies
&amp; all them that hate us be uttterly cut off. When they eat the
ſweet Pulſe, which they call <hi>Silka,</hi> they ſay, Let our enemies
periſh from among the midſt of us. When they eat the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
which they call <hi>Timarim,</hi> they ſay, Let our enemies
be conſumed and blotted out. When they eat the Gourds,

let our good works and deſervings, be read and publiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:40423:122"/>
The morning come, they repair to the Synagogue more
early then at other times; ſinging many Pſalms, and ſaying
many Prayers. They take the book of the Law twice out of
the Ark, reading some ſections out of it, as in imitation of
<hi>Ezra,</hi> who did the like, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 8. but God knows in a
far different manner.</p>
               <p>After their <hi>Haphtarah,</hi> or Lecture out of the Prophets is
ended, one goes up into the Pulpit, and ſounding the Rams
horns at ſeveral times, diſtinctly bellows out thereupon thirty
words; ſome with an equal, others with an interrupted tone.
If the trumpet give a ſhrill and pleaſant ſound, they take as a
certain ſigne, that a good and a happy year will then befal
them: but if on the contrary, the ſound be dull and hollow,
or perhaps none at all, it fills their hearts with ſorrow, being
a very probable token of an unfruitful and dangerous ſeaſon.
When the trumpeter hath done his office,<note place="margin">Psal. 89. 16.</note> the whole Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
trumptes out thoſe words of <hi>David, Bleſſed is the people,
O Lord, that can rejoyce in thee, they ſhall walk, in the light of
thy countenance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Morning prayer ended, they return again to their houſes:
where they eat and drink, and ſound upon their Rams-horns.
For it is a poſition of the Rabbines, that at this time every
one ought to be merry and jocund, being aſſured, that God
hath been gracious unto him in pardoning his ſins and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
and not becauſe he hath fill'd his panch, and liquored
his throat, for this would God rather impute unto them as a
ſin, then recompense as a good work.</p>
               <p>After this their repaſt, every one, man, woman, and child,
haſten to the water, or to ſome Bridge, thereupon to make
<hi>Taſchlich,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mich. 7. 19.</note> that is to ſay, to caſt their ſins into the water: and
the ground of the practiſe is that of the Prophet, <hi>He will turn
again and have mercy upon us: be will ſubdue our iniquities, and
caſt all our ſins into the bottom of the ſea.</hi> The Jews thus gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
together upon the Bridge, ſo ſoon as they behold the
fiſhes, accounting the ſight as a proſperous ſigne and token,
they caper aloſt, and ſhake their garments over the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iſhes,
dreaming, and vainly conceiting, that by this their foolery,
they have ſhaked off all their ſinnes upon the fiſhes backs,
which ſwim away with them,<note place="margin">Levit. 16.</note> even as the ſcape-Goat which
carried away the ſinnes of their anceſtors into the wilderneſs.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:40423:122"/>
Others write, that they do it in remembrance of <hi>Abraham;</hi>
who travelling to ſacrifice his ſon <hi>Iſaac</hi> upon Mount <hi>Meriah,</hi>
which was upon the firſt day of September: Satan met him,
and turned himſelf into a great River, which at the firſt took
him only to the knees; but by and by it reacht his neck. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
perceiving himſelf to be in ſuch a diſtreſſe, and that he
was in danger of drowning, cried mightily unto God, who
heard his prayer, and turned the water into dry ground; as
it is recorded in the tract <hi>Medraſch rotoſoha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Evening being come, they fall again to eat and drink, and
make merry as they were wont; and in this manner they ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate
the feaſt of the New-year in great ſecurity, with
much mirth and jollity for the ſpace of two dayes together. I
conclude with that of the Prophet,<note place="margin">Mich. 2. 11.</note> If a man walk in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and would lie falſly, ſaying, I will propheſie unto thee of wine,
and of ſtrong drink, he ſhall even be the prophet of this people. To
which alludes that of <hi>Sophonie;</hi> Her Prophets are light,<note place="margin">Soph. 3. 4.</note> and

an Oath.</p>
               <p>Upon the ninth day they forſake their beds betimes in the
morning, frequent the Synagogue, ſing and pray. So ſoon
as they return home, every male old and young takes a Cock,
and every woman a Hen into their hands: the master of the
family doing likewiſe,<note place="margin">Psal. 107. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,

Their ſoul abhorred all manner of meat, and they were even at
deaths door. So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble,
he delivered them out of their diſtreſſe. He ſent forth his word
and healed them, and they were ſaved from their deſtruction. O
that men would therefore praiſe the Lord for his goodneſſe, and
declare the wonders that he doth for the children of men; that they
would offer unto him the ſacrifice of thanksgiving, and tell out his
works with gladneſſe.</hi> And again, <hi>If there be a meſſenger with
him, or an interpreter, one of a thouſand to declare unto man his

ſhall be my reconciliation, he ſhall die for me, but I ſhall
enter into life and bliſſe with them that are righteous in Iſrael.
Amen. This he doth three times, as was ſaid before; once
for himſelf, once for his children, and once for ſtrangers
which sojourn with him according to the cuſtome of the high
Prieſt in ancient dayes, as it is recorded in the third book of
<hi>Moſes.</hi> In the next place he takes the Cock and kills him,<note place="margin">Levit. 16, 17.</note> and
drawing, and gathering the skin together about his neck, firſt
meditates with himſelf, that he is worthy to have his own
throat cut for his ſinnes and offences, and then cutting the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:40423:123"/>
Cocks throat, thinks himſelf worthy to be puniſhed with the
ſword: After this he takes the cock, and with all his
might throws him upon the ground, thereby ſignifying, that
he deſerves to be stoned to death for his sins and wickedness:
laſtly, he puts him upon the ſpit and roaſts him: thereby gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
others to underſtand, that to be burnt in a fiery furnace
doth not equalize his deſert. Theſe four kindes of death the
poor Cock undergoes for his Maſter. The intrals, out of
commiſeration, they commonly caſt upon the houſe top, that
it may alſo be partaker of ſuch a ſacrifice. Others ſay that
they do it, becauſe ſin is rather an internal then an external
thing, and that it cleaves faſt to the bowels of the Cock:
ſome Crows coming by, may claw them up and flee away
with them into the wilderneſſe; even as the ſcape-Goat in the
Old Teſtament ran away with the ſins of the people into the
Deſert.</p>
               <p>They take all poſſible pains and care to procure a white
Cock for the ſacrifice. They will by no means admit of a red
one; becauſe ſuch an one is full of ſins, ſeeing ſin it self is red
alſo, as it is written: <hi>Come now let us reaſon together,</hi>

                  <hi>faith the
Lord; though your ſins were as crimſon, yet ſhall they be as white
as ſnow: though they were red like ſcarlet, they ſhall be as wooll.</hi>
Now if the Cock be white, he is not polluted with ſin, and ſo
is able to bear the ſins of others, which being red he could
not poſſibly do, being ſtufft with his own ſins already. <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
Margarita</hi> in his book of the faith of the Jews, regiſters
it as the affirmation of ſome of the Hebrew Doctors, that an
Ape is a more fitting beaſt for this dayes ſacrifice then the
Cock, becauſe in his face he more repreſents a Man. Yet
they chuſe a Cock rather then any other creature, becauſe
a Man in Hebrew is called <hi>Gebher:</hi>

<hi>Gebber</hi> muſt alſo in juſtice ſuffer for his offence. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Jews conſidering the burden of death too grievous to
be born, and the puniſhment too heavie, ſpare themſelves and
kill the Cock, which the Babylonian Talmudiſts call <hi>Gebher,</hi>
to ſatisfie the judge of all fleſh; and by this ſhift <hi>Gebher</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends,
and <hi>Gebher</hi> ſuffers for it. Blinde and beaſtly Jews how
do they triſle and think to puzzle God in that manner, that

this their horrible blindneſſe above example, without pattern.
Such another expoſition reliſhing of the ſame pate we finde in
the book called <hi>Schebet Jehudah;</hi> written firſt in Hebrew,
then tranſlated into the Teutonick tongue by the Jews, and
printed at <hi>Cracovia</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> ſome twenty two years ago. It
is a certain diſputation between a Jew and a Chriſtian before
<hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of <hi>Portugal:</hi> wherein, when the Chriſtian
urged divers places of Scripture proving Chriſt to be the true
Meſſias, and amongſt others that of the Pſalmist, <hi>My God,
my God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 22. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> The Jew made anſwer, that
it was a certain property belonging to the holy Scripture to be
capable of divers interpretations, amongſt which that is the
beſt which may be confirmed and declared by other places of
holy writ. But as for the forecited place, there were many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Scriptures which did evidently prove that it cannot be
underſtood of Chriſt. And firſt of all, ſaith the Jew I will
rell thee, what anſwer a learned Rabbine did upon a certain
time make unto the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Yesterday ſaid he unto the
King, I being very wroth with my houſhold Cock, becauſe
he had troubled me in my ſtudieſ with his crowing musick, I
ſmote him with my ſtaff, put him into a dark room where he
ceaſed his crowing: yet withal this my anger being never a
jot abated, I did beat him till I had rent his skin, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted
his bones, then I put him into a Pot, and covered it
according as I thought meet and convenient, which ſerved
him for a Coffin, for there he died. After his death there
happened out a miracle, for his life returned unto him again,
and he began to ſing and crow as at former times: and this
is the true meaning and expoſition of theſe words urged by
the Chriſtian out of the 22 Pſalm: Which appears ſo to be if
we parallel the place with that of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> in the third of his
Lamentations and the firſt verſe. <hi>I am the man that have ſeen
affliction in the rod of his indignation. He hath led me &amp; brought
me into darkneſſe, but not light. Surely he is turned againſt me,
be turneth his hand againſt me all the day. My fleſh and my skin
hath he cauſed to wax old, and he hath broken my bones. He bath
builded againſt me, and compaſſed me with gali and labour. He
hath heaged about me that I cannot get out, he bath made my
chains heavy. And when I cry and ſhout he ſhutteth out my
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:40423:124"/>
prayers.</hi> I am the man <hi>Am Gebher,</hi> that is to ſay, I am the
Cock, for the word among the Talmudiſts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ignifieth ſo
much. <hi>Who bath ſee naffliction? In the rod of his indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
There is the rod with which the Cock was beaten. <hi>He
bath led me,</hi> there is his flight: <hi>into darkneſs and not into
light,</hi> there is the place of obſcurity into which he was put.
<hi>He turns his hand againſt me,</hi> there is the ſecond beating after
that he was put up in his cloſe priſon, or the motion whereby
he thought himſelf to move in the pot. <hi>My fleſh and my skin
hath he cauſed to wax old,</hi> that is to ſay, he hath torn and
rent it. <hi>He hath broken my bones,</hi> or cut me in pieces. <hi>He
hath builded againſt me,</hi> He hath ſhut me up in the pot. <hi>He
hath ſet me in dark places,</hi> that is, he hath put me in the pot
and covered it. <hi>And when I cry and ſhout,</hi> which words
ſignifie unto us, that the Cock ſung and crowed after he was
dead, So much foppery out of the book called <hi>Schebet
Jehudah,</hi> out of which we may plainly ſee after what a
ridiculous manner the Jews interpret and make a mock of
the holy Scripture, and prove themſelves to be really poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
with that phrenſie, blindneſs, and hardneſs of heart,
wherewith <hi>Moſes</hi> threatned them. We may ſee alſo with
what art these jugling mountebanks, and quackſalvering im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtros,
can metamorphoſe a man into a Cock, and again,
turn a Cock into a man. Truly I am forced to believe, that
if the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> had uſed the word <hi>Gebher</hi> in his fifty
third chapter, the man that is there made mention of, ſhould of
neceſſity (the Jews being tranſlators) have been a very Cock.
Seeing the Prophet calls him <hi>Iſch machobheth</hi> a man full of
ſorrows, deſpiſed and not eſteemed. One that hath borne
our infirmities, and carried our ſorrows, even Chriſt: who
was beaten for our ſins, and wounded for our tranſgreſſions.
The chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, by whoſe
ſtripes we are healed. Yet the Jews will not acknowledge,
receive, and confeſs, ſuch a man: but chuſe one whom they
can kill, put upon the broach, roſt at the fire, and fill their
filthy paunches withall. But woe and alaſs they may long
look for health from the wounds of an houſehold Cock. The
Greek Calends will firſt have place in the annual computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
before they receive from hence any ſetled peace of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:40423:125"/>
conſcience, which evidently appears to be true at the houre
of their death: when deſtitute of all comfort ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for my ſins. A miſerable poor and cold comfort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
when not only death temporal but eternal both of ſoule
and body muſt be the wages for their ſin: This the Jews
cannot comprehend, ſeeing God in his just judgment hath
ſhut their eyes that they cannot ſee nor underſtand. Pitifull
and lamentable is their caſe, in which with an unwilling heart
I leave them, and deſcend to a further declaration of their
preparation to this feſtival. After that they have made an
attonement for their ſins by the ſacrificing of the Cock, they
repair to the place where the dead are buried, where they
ſay many prayers, as they did alſo at New-years-tide, give
almes, and ſo much mony to the poor as the ſacrificed Cock
was worth. For in ancient times they were wont to give
the Cocks themſelves unto the poor and needy, which they
took in great indignation, and abhorred them as a thing abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable,
and in eating whereof they ſhould ſwallow down
the ſins of the rich. Therefore the rich men redeem it with
money, and either roſting or boiling it, and feed thereupon with
great joy and rejoycing.</p>
               <p>After dinner they goe into some coole well or cistern,
and waſh themſelves as they alſo did at new-years-tide.
They duck often, and dive to the bottome of the water, by
which actions they thinke themſelves to be clean waſhed and
purged from their offences. Some in the mean time provide
lights, which they are to uſe in the Synagogue the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
The Jews in Germany prepare a light for every
one in particular, which to be neceſſary, they prove out of
the <hi>Cabala</hi> in this manner. The Hebrew word <hi>Ner</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
a light or Candle, contains the number of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty. Now every man hath two hundred forty
eight members in his body, to which if we had his ſpirit and
ſoule, this number equalizeth the firſt. And by this reaſon
the word <hi>Ner</hi> ſignifying a light, is to be underſtood of man
man, that is to ſay, every man ought to have a ſeveral light,
lamp, or candle to himſelf. Now for the women, it is not
neceſſary that any lights ſhould be provided for them, ſeeing
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40423:125"/>
they have four members (according to the Jewiſh anatomie)
more then is in man. Yet notwithſtanding the Jews inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
other nations, provide lights alſo for the women, not
of neceſſity, but for the ornament and grace of their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue.
They who are very religious have commonly two
lights provided, one for the ſoule, the other for the body.
That for the ſoule being more coſtly and precious, which they
call by the name of <hi>Neſchamah.</hi>

               <p>At eventide again they return into the Synagogue, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſering
up their evening ſacrifice of prayer and thankſgiving.
One goes and ſalutes another, if any have a quarrel, or beat
any malice to his fellow, he craves pardon for his fault, and
reconciles himſelf unto him. If any have received any hurt,
he is bound from his very heart to forgive him that hurt him,
for if he forgive another, God will alſo forgive him his treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes.
If he will not at the firſt time of intreaty forgive
him, then he that offended him takes three more unto him,
and craves pardon the ſecond time, yea alſo the third for his
offence. If this will nothing avail, he calls ten men unto
him, and earneſtly intreats the party offended to forgive
him. If he grant him a pardon, well, if not, well alſo, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God is appeaſed, and this his fact ſhall never riſe up in
judgment againſt him. This cuſtome of asking forgiveneſs
is very neceſſary, becauſe God will not pardon the offences
committed againſt our brother, upon the day of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
unleſs we make an attonement with him. If it ſo chance
that the party offended be dead, then he who committed the
offence againſt him, calls ten men, goes unto his grave and
ſaith, <hi>I have offended againſt the God of Iſrael and him that lies
buried in this place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every one makes his confeſſion unto his fellow before
ſupper, leſt in ſupper time a bone ſhould get into his throat
and choak him, and ſo he ſhould die without any confeſſion,
or acknowledgment of his former ſins. They make their
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:40423:126"/>
confeſſion in manner following. Two men go into ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
corner of the Synagogue, the one of them kneels down,
turning his face towards the North and his back towards the
South, the other takes a good leathern whip and gives him
thirty nine laſhes upon the back. He that receives them and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
his faults, ſmiting his breaſt at every ſeveral ſtripe: he that
playes the beadle and ſoundly whips his hide, repeats theſe
words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>He was ſo merciful that he forgave their
miſdeeds and deſtroyed them not,</hi> yea many a <hi>time turned he his
wrath away,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 78. 38.</note> 
                  <hi>and would not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuffer his whole diſpleaſure to ariſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This verſe in the Original conſiſts only of thirteen words,
which he repeats three times, adding a word for every ſtripe.
Then he that did ſo laſh the other proſtrates himſelf upon
the ground, his fellow doing as much for him: mutually
undergoing this grievous pennance for their offences: Yet
notwithſtanding theſe ſubtle foxes love their own fleſh ſo
well, that they endure but a ſmall deal of pain by ſuch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
whipping. This kinde of whipping ſeems to take
its original from that act of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who enacted, that <hi>if ſo,
the wicked be worthy to be beaten, the Judge ſhall cauſe him
to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his
treſpaſs unto a certain number. Forty ſtripes ſhall he cauſe him
to have, and not paſt, leſt if he ſhould exceed, and beat him
above that with many ſtripes, thy brother ſhould appear deſpiſed
in thy ſight.</hi> This kinde of puniſhment was in ancient times
political, and was in uſe alſo among the Chriſtians, as it is alſo
at this day, for a malefactor to be beaten with rods.
The <hi>Rabbines</hi> commenting upon this place affirm, that thirty
nine ſtripes only, not forty, as the law commands are to be
inflicted upon the perſon offending. The reaſon whereof, as
one of their <hi>Rabbines</hi> tendered it unto me,<note place="margin">Deut.23. 2, 3. This was in uſe in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> dayes, who ſaith that he received forty ſtripes ſave one. 2 Cor. 11. The Jewiſh reaſon is to be approved of.</note> is that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.
In old time the whip wherewith the effend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r was
puniſhed, conſiſted of three cords, two of which were
ſhorter then the other, the third or mid cord being of ſuch a
length, that it might eaſily eacompaſs the whole body, all
the three being made of the skin of ſome yong bullock. Now
he that laſhed the del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nquent with this threefold cord, gave
unto him at one and the ſame time three ſeveral ſtripes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
one for every cord. So that in thirteen laſhes, he
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:40423:126"/>
received the ful number of thirty nine ſtripes; to which if
he had added one laſh more,<note place="margin">Rabbi Bechaim. Deut. 25. 2.</note> then had he inflicted two more
then <hi>Moſes</hi> required to be given unto him, which was no
way to be allowed of, it was therefore thought good rather
to be defective in puniſhment, then exceeding to give only
thirty nine ſtripes inſtead of forty. The true and genuine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of this place, is to be found in the Talmud, which
here I will not inſert, to avoid prolixity. This kinde of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
was inflicted upon the Apoſtle, as he himſelf wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth
in his ſecond Epiſtle to the Corinthians, and that
without doubt in a more ſmarting degree then is uſual among
the Jews at this day.</p>
               <p>Prayers being ended, they poſt home with ſpeed inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible.
Where they finde the table ready ſpread, and
furniſhed by their wives in their abſence: at which preſently
they ſit down and luſtily feed upon the Cocks and Hens, which
in the morning they offered in ſacrifice to God for their ſins:
for in their <hi>Minhagin</hi> they affirme, that it is no leſs the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of God, and a good work to fill their Panches,
and cram their Guts, this night with the Cocks and Capons;
and ſoundly to liquor their throats, then to faſt the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing;
Alwayes provided that ſupper be ended before ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,
for then the feaſt of reconciliation begins, and they are
to dreſs themſelves in neat and fine cloathing, upon which
they weare a ſurplice or garment of choiſe linnen coming
down unto their feet, hereby ſhewing unto other, that the
next day they ſhall be pure and clean from their ſins and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and like unto the Angels. Theſe garments they put on
in honour to the feſtival, the celebration of which, conſiſts
not in eating and drinking, being ſottiſhly ignorant, that the
worſhip of God is of more worth then either. Hence it is
that the Lord complains by the mouth of his Prophet. <hi>Hear
O heavens, and harken O earth: for the Lord hath ſaid, I have
nouriſhed and brought up children and they have rebelled againſt

injunction and command the Jews at this day are wont to
meet in their Synagogue about ſunſet before it be night, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
with them their wax lights, and placing them in their
Candleſticks, ſinging and praying with a beaſtly roaring and

Then they hold on to ſing and pray untill the night be far

that the feaſt endures, ſinging and praying without intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as I have ſeen ſome who have ſtood immoveable in the
ſame place for twenty ſeven hours together.</p>
               <p>When the morning begins to approach they all repair to
the Synagogue before the dawning of the day, making there
their agode untill night, boaſting very much of the book of
the Law, reading many Sections therein. Falling often to
the earth with their face uncovered, and then chiefly when
they make confeſſion of their ſins, ſmiting their breſts at
every word, to ſhew the devout attention of their mindes:
and the lifting up of their hearts unto their God and maker.
When it begins again to be night, then the Prieſt wrapping a
great hair-cloth ahout his neck, and drawing it over his head,
ſo far untill it come to the threſhold of his eyes: he bleſſeth
the people according to the ordinary forme preſcribed by
<hi>Moſes,</hi> Numbers the 6. the 24, 25, 26, and 27. verſes.
When he pronounceth the bleſſing, he ſtretcheth out his
hands towards the people: they covering their faces with
their own; for it is lawful for no man to look upon the
hands of the Prieſts: becauſe the ſpirit of the Lord reſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, while he bleſſeth the Congregation. As it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,

                  <hi>ſhewing himſelf through the grates,</hi> that is to ſay, God
ſtands at the Prieſts back, and looks through the windows
and grates, that is to ſay, through his hands being being ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out, and his fingers being ſpread abroad ſevered one from
another. Then he ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d voice, and the reaſon of this reiteration is, becauſe
God at this time departs from them and goes into heaven,
not coming again untill the prieſt be the ſeventh time in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
of this prayer. The ſeventh time therefore they ſing
it in a melodious tune, with a ſenſe bereaving harmony,
having very good skill, and ſweet voices, as they can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
who have heard them.</p>

                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:40423:129"/>
Before they depart the Synagogue, they blow upon the
Rams horne before mentioned, a ſound both long and loud,
in remembrance of the year of Jubile, which in ancient times
was wont to begin as upon this day. Others write that they
do it in memory of the ſeven heavens which the Lord ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
when he deſcended upon Mount Sinai, and gave the law
to the people of Iſrael, and declare unto them that in heaven
there was no other God beſides him.</p>
               <p>When they have put an end to this their feſtival, and a
period to theſe their trifles, then (as they bluſh not to affirm)
there comes a voice from heaven ſaying, goe and eat thy bread
with joy and gladneſs of heart, for God accepts all thy good
works at the beſt. Inſtantly upon the hearing of the voice,
they return to their own houſes, ſome carrying the reliques
of their wax lights along with them, becauſe they commonly
uſe them in making the ſeparation between the feſtival and
other dayes of the week. But others on the contrary, leave
them in the Synagogue in the Candleſticks for a year toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
lighting them at ſome certain times. They who are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
holy and religious among them, have a wax light burning
in the Synagogue night and day, never going out through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ought
the whole year: this they call <hi>Ner Tamid,</hi> an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
light. When they are returning home, one ſayes unto
another, God the Creator ſeal unto a happy year: for the
three books of which we formerly made mention, are now
ſealed up: and Gods ſentence pronounced upon every one is
ratified and ſtands immutable.</p>
               <p>Being come home, they finde their guts to make a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
complaint, and themſelves exceeding hungry, having
eaten nothing for twenty eight hours together: they make
haſte therefore to ſatisfie their greedy appetite, and to reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
their belly with ſtore of victuals.</p>
               <p>The next morning after they riſe betimes out of their beds,
and return to the Synagogue, leſt Satan should take an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to complain of them, ſaying unto God, yeſterday they
roſe early becauſe it was the day of reconciliation: but this
day their devotion grows cold, loving their pillow better
then the Synagogue. What ſhould I ſay more, this day they
are ſo holy and religious, ſo honeſt and devout, that even

the Devil is forced whether he will or not to commend their
carriage: concerning which we have his following conference
in <hi>Pirk Rabbi Eleazar.</hi> Upon that day in which God gave
the Law to the Children of Iſrael: the evil ſpirit <hi>Samael</hi> came

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no mention made of this Feaſt in holy writ.
The Rabbines inſtituted it as a day of rejoycing,
in that God had given them ſo much as to ſpend a
whole year in the reading of his Law and exerciſe
thereof: in that upon this day they have finiſhed, accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
and brought to an end the lecture and expoſition of the
of the text thereof in their Church or Synagogue, in that he
hath in great clemency granted them power and faculty to
perform the ſame.</p>
               <p>They distribute and part the five books of <hi>Moſes</hi> into fifty
two Chapters of Sections, whereof they read one every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day, ſo that the laſt Section is read upon the firſt day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Feaſt of tabernacles, which commonly falls upon the
twenty third day of September. It is recorded in the Talmud,
that the Prieſts were wont to skip, caper, and dance, uſing all
kinde of muſical inſtruments upon this day, practiſing among
the vulgar many incred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ble and skittiſh fooleries; which here
to ſet down would be rather a wearineſſe then either pleaſure
or profit to the reader. Upon this day they repair to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue,
and in a ſolemn proceſſion take all the books of the
Law out of the Ark, reading the firſt and laſt Section, leaping
about the Ark with the books in their hands, and when they
are weary in great pomp putting them into the Ark again.
So long as the books are out of the Ark, a burning Lamp
ſhines therein, for the Ark muſt not at any time be found
empty; whereupon it neceſſarily follows, that the Lamp ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
the place of the books, avails as much as the books
themſelves: for the Law is called a Lamp or light, as it is
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40423:130"/>
written: <hi>The Command is a Lantern,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, they ſcatter Apples, Plums, and Pears, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the younger ſort, that they alſo may take occaſion to
expreſſe the utmoſt of their mirth and jollity. Yet it often
falls out, that that hereby is occaſioned a greater deal of grief
and melancholy in the hearts of theſe nonaged ſtriplings, in
that they often in ſcambling for theſe fruits fall into ſtrife,
contention, and brawling, and at laſt make trial which among
them have the moſt patient ſtretching ears.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe upon this day the reading of the Law is fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
in a ſecond place they go åbout the diſtribution of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
functions and offices, and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that belong to the Lecturers of the Law. Theſe their offices
or functions are ſold by open ſale in their Synagogue; and
he that at the third asking offers the moſt money for them,
hath them aſſured unto him, and is bound to keep them. And
in the firſt place the Clerk or Sexton of the Synagogue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims
the office of them who are to light candles all the year
following: as alſo that of the Cup-bearers who carry the
wine, wherewith they begin and end their Sabbaths, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Feſtivals. For though the Maſter of every family be
bound to give a beginning to the Sabbath by the conſecration
of a cup of wine: yet that this ceremony is alſo performed in
the Synagogue, and that publickly before the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
by reaſon of the poorer ſort, who for want of means
cannot procure wine at home for the initiation of the Sabbath.
And moreover it is not to be neglected, becauſe the Boyes
and children that drink thereof, become religious and godly
Jews.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Clerk proclaims that if any man will buy <hi>Geli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah,</hi>
let him come forth, which is an office of unfolding and
folding up again the book of the Law.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is demanded, if any one will buy <hi>Hagbohah;</hi>
He that hath this office is buſied in a ſpeedy lifting up of the
book of the Law, carrying it about the Pew or Desk that any
one may read thereupon. It is neceſſarily required, that he
that carries it be ſtrong and of an able body, that he may
without ſtumbling carry the book unfolded with ſtretched out
arms, for if he chance to faulter and ſlip but with one foot,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:40423:131"/>
not bearing it in that manner which is required, the whole
Congregation is enjoyned to faſt, which is reputed as a very
bad ſigne of ſome enſuing misfortune.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it is demanded, who purchaſe <hi>Etz Chajim</hi> for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
He that hath this office is allowed to touch the two pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of wood to which the Law is faſtened by long skins or
Parchments, as alſo to carry and adminiſter the little Bag,
Coat, or Sachel, in which the book of the Law after the ending
of the Lecture is with all ſpeed to be wrapt up. Young men
and ſtriplings commonly buy this office: perſwading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
that by touching thoſe forementioned pieces of wood,
their honeſty ſhall be improved, and their underſtanding bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered:
hoping that thereby their life ſhall be prolonged, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe pieces of wood are called <hi>Etz Chajim,</hi> which by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
ſignifieth <hi>the trees of life,</hi> as it is written: <hi>She is
a tree of life</hi> (meaning the Law) <hi>to them that lay hold on her,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 18.</note>
                  <hi>and bleſſed is he that retaineth her.</hi> Theſe are touched and
handled when the book of the Law is wrapped up, where a
ſpecial heed muſt be taken, and care had, that they touch not
the Parchments with their naked hands, for this is a hainous
offence.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, it is demanded, who will buy <hi>Acheron,</hi> which is
an office that whoſoever in the whole congregation is the laſt
called out upon any Feſtival, he muſt read ſomewhat out of
the book of the Law.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, it is demanded, who will buy <hi>Shehia.</hi> He that
hath this office is a kinde of overſeer, who looks unto the reſt
that they be not negligent in their charge and place; and if
he finde them ſo, he may put them out, and himſelf in.</p>
               <p>All the money which they get for theſe places and offices,
they beſtow in the reparation of the Synagogue and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the poor. From this open ſale of Eccleſiaſtical fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
often proceed as from a Fountain, envies, brawlings,
contentions, and evil ſurmiſings. Yea, God himſelf is often
blaſphemed, becauſe the favour and countenance and reſpect
of perſons bears a greater ſway in ſharing then Juſtice: while
the rich is preferred before the poor; a ſtripling ſooner ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into holy Orders, then one of riper years, an illiterate
Aſſe ſooner then a learned Doctor, and an ill liver commonly
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:40423:131"/>
before an honeſt man. Hence it is that theſe things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
ſuch a flood of contention often ariſeth, that a Chriſtian
Magiſtrate is often ſent for to ſtop &amp; stay it; forunder the Sun
there is not a more teſty, envious, jarring, and more implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
people then the Jews. And this is the fruit which they
reap from the reading of the Law with ſo great attention as
they bring and boaſt of; and to ſay the very truth, no better
can be expected, ſeeing their outſide makes a beautiful and
glorious ſhew, but within they are full of malice and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.

Wherefore <hi>Judas</hi> and his brethren, with the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation

the Altar ſhould be kept in their ſeason from year to year, by
the ſpace of eight dayes, from the five and twentieth day of

Jews at this day do alſo keep and celebrate, but in a far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

manner then thoſe ancient <hi>Machabites.</hi> For here now is
nothing to be ſeen but feaſting and gormandiſing, quaffing
and drinking, piping and dancing, revelling and roaring, all
to paſſe away the time; but little or no thankſgiving unto the
Lord of hoſts for the victory and conqueſt over their enemies,
as upon this day.</p>
               <p>At that time, when <hi>Judas</hi> had dedicated the Temple, none
of the holy oil could be found: ſo that the Lamps could not
be lighted according to the ordinance of <hi>Moſes: Judas</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made diligent ſearch in the Temple, where he found a
ſmall horn of oil, ſealed with the Ring of one of the Prieſts,
which was onely ſufficient to feed the Lamps for one nights
ſpace, yet preſerved in that happy manner, that it was not
polluted by the enemies. Hereupon the heart of <hi>Judas</hi> and
the whole congregation was filled with ſorrow, becauſe they
could have no more oil till theſe eight dayes were expired, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the City <hi>Tehoa</hi> from whence it was to be fetched was
four dayes journey diſtant from <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> In this their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
the favàour and mercy of God appeared to them by
this miracle, for the horn of oil ſailed not for eight dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In the remembrance of this favour and bleſſing ſo mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly
conferred upon them, the Jews at this day use a great
deal of ſuperstitious pomp, in tinding of the Lamps appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the Synagogue in the time of this Feaſt: They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
a Candleſtick with ſeven branches capable of ſeven lights
or Lamps, which burn every night, though not until the
morrow, from the beginning of this Feaſt unto the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
and whereſoever any of theſe Lamps are found, whether
in their Houſes, Stoves or Bedchambers, there it is not lawful
to move the finger to any kinde of work. A Lamp must alſo
be hung as well upon the right ſide of the gate of every mans
houſe as of the Synagogue, the diſtance whereof from the
ground ought to be ten ſpans, no lower; twenty, but no
higher. It is a great queſtion among them how long theſe
Lamps may burn, and by whom they may be tinded: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one may be lighted at another? and ſuch like. Thus are
they very ſolicitous and careful about theſe external lights;
never conſidering that there is nothing but darkneſſe in their
own hearts: neither ſtriving that they may be illuminated, by
the light of Gods holy Spirit.</p>

of theſe two dayes, they buſie themſelves with no other things
then eating and drinking, ſmelling, and bibbing, dancing, and
piping, ſinging, and roaring, ieaſting, and ſporting, riming,
and ſcoffing, the women putting on mens apparrell and the
men clothing themſelves in womens attire, which although
it be expreſly forbid in the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet they make there
one exception,<note place="margin">Orach: chajim num: 615.</note> ſaying, that it is lawful and no offence to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe

merry as upon theſe dayes, to goe a whoring, to drink and be
drunke, yea in that meaſure, that he cannot make any difference

is to ſay, untill he be ſo beſotted with the ale tappe, that he
cannot for his heart declare how many letters be contained in
any of theſe words, yea moreover, any one is permitted at
this time to poure in ſtrong drink, until he knowes not how
many fingers he hath on either hand. Which precept indeed
is moſt diligently observed and kept, according to the very ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
thereof by the Jews at this day, and that chiefly by the
beggerly crew, to whom the richer ſort ſend gifts and preſents
in a far greater meaſure then they do at other times, to the end
that one may not mock another for being drunk, bein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
and ſtrictly prohibited to ſend away their meat and
drink to any other end and purpoſe. With theſe Bacchanal
rites, drunken fits, and beſotting beaſtlineſs, they put an end
to their annual feaſts. For this of Purim is the laſt feſtival in
the year, having no more until the feaſt of the paſſover. If the
Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> were alive at this day, or ſhould riſe from the
dead, truly and really might he take occaſion, and that both
forcible and urgent to cry out, <hi>Woe and claſs unto them that

In the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> there is only one
faſt commanded to be kept by the Jews, which
is upon the tenth of September, upon which the
feaſt of reconciliation is annually kept and celebrated, as was
formerly declared. Beſides this, it is regiſtred in ancient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,

by the ancient Patriarchs and Prophets, according as

after the building of the ſecond Temple, makes mention
of foure general faſts in theſe words.<note place="margin">zach. 8. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord

               <p>The faſt of the tenth moneth was uſually,<note place="margin">The firſt faſt.</note> and is to this
day, kept by the Jews upon the tenth day of the ſame, to
wit, December: becauſe upon this <hi>Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uchaddnezar</hi> began to

great trouble and calamities.</p>
               <p>The faſt of the fourth moneth,<note place="margin">The ſecond faſt.</note> was and is kept to this
day upon the ſeventeenth day thereof: becauſe upon this
they endured many great afflictions which are not yet diſgeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For as upon this day the tables of the law were broken;
the daily ſacrifice ceaſed: the book of the law was burnt,
an Idol the abomination of deſolation was ſet up in the holy
place, the temple of Jeruſalem. The city it ſelf beſieged
the ſecond time, overthrown and taken. For theſe cauſes
the Jews in theſe our dayes faſt very devoutly, begin ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and earneſtly to repent them of their former life, if a man
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:40423:134"/>
may believe the external geſture: from which it is no doubt
but their heart is too too much a roving. The dayes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this faſt, even unto the ninth day of the next moneth, are
accounted ominous and unfortunate: upon theſe no ſchool-maſter
muſt dare to whip his boyes. If any Jew alſo have
a case to be tried by the law, between him and a Chriſtian,
at this time he ſeeks all manner of evaſion and excuſe, that
he may not appear before the Judg untill theſe dayes be expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
fearing leſt his cauſe ſhould fail and not prove good, and
he be overthrown therein.</p>
               <p>The faſt of the fift moneth,<note place="margin">The third faſt.</note> is kept upon the ninth day
of July: becauſe upon this very day the temple was burnt,
and turned into aſhes: In the time here of they goe barefoot:
ſitting upon the earth, reading doleful ſtories, and the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of Jeremy. They goe into the place of burial, where
they ſob out their doleful accents of grief and ſorrow, amidſt
the ſorrowful conſort of departed ſouls, bewailing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations
of their beautiful temple with ſighs and grones for a
moneth together. From the firſt day until the tenth, they
neither eat fleſh nor drink wine, they enter not the bath,
waſh their face or hands, or ſuffer any raſor to come upon
their head. They do not make any marriages, appear not
in judgment but ſore againſt their wills: complaining and
crying out, that they had never any good hap or fortune in
this moneth: which they prove out of the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi>

continually ſitting upon the ground; if any thing, then
it muſt be an egge roſted: which they do likewiſe in ſigne
of ſorrow, for as an egge is round, and in figure circular, so

                  <note place="margin">Reſchis chochma parvum. p. 10.</note> that ever and anon ſo ſoon as <hi>Moſes</hi> saw that

written, that a certain godly and religious Jew called <hi>Chon
Hammagal,</hi> did faſt after the manner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo often as
he deſired ſome great and weighty matter at the hands of
God. When upon a certain time it had not rained at any

was neceſſary that men might receive the fruits of the earth in

himſelf up in ſuch a pie or cake as in cloſe priſon, and ſaying,
O Lord of the world, thy childrens eyes are all upon me,
knowing that I am as dear unto thee as any ſon can be to a

I shall anſwer to him that rebuketh me,</hi> that is to ſay, I ſtand
in my pie or cheeſ-cake expecting untill thou make me anſwer,
how it comes to paſs that the wicked do ſo prolong their life;
as <hi>Rabbi Kimchi</hi> comments upon the place. So miſerable
are theſe poor ſeduced Jews, in this manner deluded and given
over to a reprobate ſence, ſo that they cannot bluſh at any
thing, neither are ſenſible of any gripes of conſcience, while
they speak so groſly and vainly of God and his word, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
the Scripture according to the fancies of their brain, and
their own good pleaſure. This ſuperſtition and abuſe in
faſting, had a ſtrong head even in the dayes of the Prophets.
Whereupon <hi>Zachary</hi> reproves their falſe faſt, and preſcribes

                  <hi>Shall I

you faſted and mourned in the ſeventh moneth, and in the fift,
even theſe ſeventy years, did ye faſt unto me? and do I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove

did you not eat for your ſelves and drink for your ſelves?
ſhould ye not hear the words which the Lord hath cried by
the miniſtry of the former Prophets, when Jeruſalem was
inhabited and in proſperity, and the cities thereof round about
her, when the ſouth and the plain was inhabited. Thus ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Lord of hoſts ſaying, execute true judgment and
ſhew mercy and compaſſion every man upon his brother, and
oppreſs not the widow or the fatherleſs, the ſtranger nor the
poor, and let none of you imagine evil againſt his brother in
his heart. But they refuſed to harken, and pulled away the
ſhoulder, and ſtopped their ears that they ſhould not hear;
Yea they made their hearts as an adamant ſtone, leſt they
ſhould hear the law and the words which the Lord of hoſts
ſent in his ſpirit by the miniſtry of the former Prophets:
therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of hoſts. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it came to paſs, that as he cried and they would no heare,
ſo they cried and I would not hear ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</p>
               <p>So much ſhall ſuffice to be ſpoken concerning the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies

and eating of fiſh, flesh, and milk-meats. Which

                  <note place="margin">Exod. 23. 19.</note> Hence it is that they have written divers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
and expoſitions upon this text, concerning the uſing
of fleſh, hony and other viands.</p>
               <p>Their kitchin boyling veſſels are of two ſorts, the one
whereof is appointed for the ſecthing of fleſh, the other for
milke. Their milke veſſels have three peculiar marks upon
them. if they be of wood, then they give them three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
cuts, whereby they may be diſtinguiſhed from others:
and this they do, becauſe the forecited verſe is found three
times in the law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Hereupon it alſo comes to paſs,
that a Jew continually carries about him two knives, one for
fleſh and another for cheeſe and fiſh, which have alſo three
ſeveral markes or ſtamps upon them. If through negligence
one veſſel ſhould be taken for another, and the contrary thing
boiled therein, then it is not lawful for any Jew to eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
breaking the veſſels, if they be of earth, but waſhing them
with water, if they be of wood, and that in a moſt exact man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
If they be of iron, they caſt them into the fire, ſuffering
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40423:137"/>
them there to abide until they be fully purified.</p>
               <p>It is enacted that fleſh and milke muſt not be boiled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
at the ſame time over the ſame fire: neither are they
to be ſet on the table one oppoſite or over againſt another,
but ought to be ſeparated by ſomething put between them:
and to this end they ſpread one cloth for the dishes furniſhed
with fleſh, another for thoſe wherein cheeſe and milke are
ſerved in, He that eates either pottage or fleſh, he may
not be allowed for a whole houres ſpace, to eat butter,
or cheeſe, or any milke-meats. Yea moreover, they who
would be accounted preciſe indeed make ſix whole hours
diſtances.</p>
               <p>It is lawful for any one to eat a hen with almond milke:
If any one love milke ſo well, that he cannot abſtain from it,
an eſpecial diſpenſation is granted him to taſte thereof ſooner
then ordinary, ſo that he pick his teeth accurately and Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
like, waſh his mouth, and eat a cruſt of bread to take
away the taſt of the fleſh. If the fat of any thing fall into
any diſh of meat boiled in milke, that meat is prohibited to
be eaten. Yet if the meat be ſixty times more in quantity
then the fat, then may it lawfully ſerve for the ſufficing of
any mans appetite. An egge muſt not be boiled in a pan or
pot in which fleſh is ſod. If they deſire to have their egges
poched, they firſt break them into a platter, or poure them
out of one ſhell into another, having a diligent care, and
provident eſpial, that no drop of blood be in them. And
this is the reaſon why the Jews alwayes open their egges at
the top, becauſe in that place there is often found a veine of a
bloody colour.</p>
               <p>If in carving up a hen they finde any egges within her,
they uſe them not until they be mollified in water and ſalt.
It is a hainous offence to set fiſh and fleſh at the ſame time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one table, as alſo to boile them in the ſame pan, much more
to eat them together, for the leproſie follows as a reward of
the fact. Therefore they either waſh their mouth or hands
between the eating of fleſh and fiſh, or else they eat an apple
or piece of bread between the eating of the one, and handling
of the other. Briefly it is accounted as a great point of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
among the Jews, rightly to diſtinguiſh the kindes of

meat; hence when ſome difficulties object themſelves unto
their view, they goe for a ſolution to the learned Rabbines.
All their kitchin veſſels, whether of gold, ſilver, tin, or lead,
braſs, or copper, if they can endure the fire, they are to be
purged by fire, if not, by water, according to the command
of Moſes, <hi>Whatſoever will abide the fire, you ſhall make it go
through the fire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 31. 23.</note>

               <p>The Talmudiſts upon theſe words infer,<note place="margin">Tract. 1. Elim c. 5. p. 75.</note> that ſuch veſſels
ought to be caſt into a ceſterne or pit where a menſtrous
woman hath waſhed her ſelf in the time of her uncleanneſs,
becauſe ſuch women in the Hebrew tongue are called <hi>Niddoth,</hi>
and the water of ſeparation <hi>Me niddoth.</hi> Here the Jews
give an evident demonſtration that an Aſſe may be known by
his eares from any other creature, for the forecited words of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> make not mention of veſſels in general, but of that
particular houſhold-ſtuffe which the children of Iſrael took
in way of prey form their enemies the Midianites; which
at that time were a prophane, ungodly and reprobate people.
And therefore when <hi>Moſes</hi> made the people to purge and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
every thing they had taken in battle, partly by fire, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by water, according as the condition of the thing it ſelfe
would ſuffer: his deſire was to ſignifie unto them, that they
onght by no means to make any uſe of the Midianites goods,
unleſs they were firſt of all cleanſed and ſanctified. Finally,
becauſe at this day the Jews will not uſe any veſſel belonging
to a Chriſtian, unleſs it be firſt purged in the foreſaid manner,
they hereby clearly ſhew unto the world, the opinion they

               <p>In the exerciſe of this their trade they uſe knives of divers
ſorts, proportioning them according to the quantity and
bigneſs of the beaſt that is to be ſlaughtered. Their knives of
a greater ſize have commonly broad and blunt edges, yet apt
enough to cut: if they have any gap in them, if it be never ſo
little, it is not lawful to uſe them. The greater ſort of beaſts
being ready to undergo the knife have their feet tied by the
Butcher, in imitation of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who bound his ſon hand
and foot when he was about to ſacrifice him. Afterwards he
cuts the weeſil of the beaſt at one cut.</p>
               <p>Then he looks upon his knife, to ſee whether there be any
flaws or gaps therein, which action of his is very neceſſary,
ſeeing a gap in the edge of the knife doth in ſuch manner ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
the poor beaſt, that the blood runs unto the heart to
comfort it, ſo that the knife cannot make a paſſage for it, by
which means the beaſt becomes unfit to be eaten. When he
hath cut deep enough, he hangs the beaſt upon the Camme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
unbowels it, and making a couple of holes, one upon the
right, another upon the left ſide of the heart; he, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
who is skilful in ſearching, thruſts his hand through theſe
holes into the body of the beaſt, with an intent to know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
whether any blood or little Bladders full of blood clag
or cleave unto the heart or liver. Which if he perceive any
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:40423:139"/>
other fault, be it never ſo little; then it is not lawful for any
Jew to eat thereof: as it is written: <hi>Ye ſhall be an holy people
unto me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod, 22. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>neither ſhall you eat any fleſh that is torn of beaſts in the
field: ye ſhall caſt it to the Dog.</hi> And again, <hi>Of a beaſt defiled or
rent with beaſts, whereby he may be defiled, ye ſhall not eat: I am
the Lord.</hi> Out of theſe words the lews draw this concluſion,
That it is not lawful to eat the fleſh of any beaſt which is not
without taint, ſpot, or blemiſh; when the Text it ſelf ſpeaks
not of the living creature, but of a dead carkaſe, a beaſt that
hath died of it ſelf: or hath been torn in pieces by another.</p>
               <p>Birds and all kindes of fowl the Jews do kill and ſlaughter
in the ſame manner that they do their beaſts: cutting their
throats, and letting the blood drop down into a heap of
aſhes, covering it therewith: This their practiſe they ground
upon that action of <hi>Rebecca, who when ſhe ſaw Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>Schechitos</hi> or Butchers book have left in writing, that at that
time it was with <hi>Rebecca</hi> after the manner of women, whoſe
virgin, or menſtruous blood the Birds came and covered after
that ſhe had riſen from the carth: and therefore they ſay,
that God commanded them in lieu of this to cover and hide
the blood of Birds when they ſlaughter them.</p>

that the blood is therefore to be hid in the earth, leſt Satan
coming, and finding it uncovered, ſhould accuſe us before
God of great injuſtice; becauſe it would ſeem a very unjuſt
and cruel act, miſerably to kill and ſlaughter a poor innocent
and unreaſonable creature in ſuch a tyrannical manner, which
hath committed no ſin or offence againſt us, and therefore is
not lyable to puniſhment. Surely the Iews would make the
Devil a very ſottiſh Fool and ſhallow brain'd Aſſe who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
know thus much; and themſelves very cunning and crafty
in ſuch a circumvention of him.</p>
               <p>After that they have killed a great beaſt, they take all the
veins and nerves out of his body, picking away the fat which
cleaves unto them; then putting them in water to mollifie and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:40423:139"/>
ſoften them: after a certain ſpace taking them out again, and
waſhing them in clear water, ſo that no drop of blood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in them; then they lay them upon a ſhingle or cloven,
that the water may drop from them; then they put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a veſſel, and ſalt them; which veſſel is full of holes, to
this end, that if any blood remain in them, it being ſucked
out by the ſalt, may diſtil, and finde paſſage through the
holes and crevices. If they are not deſirous to have their
meat throughly ſalted, they put it in the pickle only for an
hour, and then boyl it. They eat not any thing which hath
the leaſt drop of blood in it; for it hath been alwayes their
uſe and cuſtom, and is at this day in a wonderful manner to
abſtain from it. They likewiſe do not eat the hinder parts of
any beaſt unto this day, becauſe the <hi>Angel touched the ſinew
that ſhrank in the hollow of Jacobs thigh.</hi> Yet the Jews of <hi>Italy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 32.</note> by the rules of their Anatomy, have found out, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that if the veins, ſinews, and arteries be artificially ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out, the hinder parts may alſo be eaten, without making
any ſcruple for conſcience ſake. Surely if the Jews who lived
in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> had been cunning skilful and expert
in this art, then had he ſpent his breath in vain, in forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them to eat ſo many ſeveral ſorts of Beaſts, Fowls, and
Fiſhes. And I am verily perſwaded, that if a Sow ſhould be
brought at this day to ſome of theſe profound Anatomiſts,
they by cutting her up, and taking out the veines, nerves, and
ſinews, would make her a dainty diſh for a Jews dinner.</p>
               <p>They ſell the hinder parts of the beaſt to the Chriſtians:
yet I would wiſh all Chriſtians that do buy any ſuch proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at the hands of a Jew, to conſider and know, that the
Jews are wont before they bring them to the Shambles, to
ſpit upon and defile them, cauſing their children to piſſe upon
them: they themſelves pronouncing a curſe upon them, that
the Gentile that buyes them may eat up their ſilthineſs, even
death it ſelf. I would not have the Reader to think this a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
for it is confirmed by the joynt teſtimony of ſo many
Jews as have been converted to the Chriſtian faith. Perhaps
the Iews are not in every place ſo evil minded, ſo ungodly,
and wicked; yet in general they bear a tyrannous hate and
malice againſt us Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:40423:140"/>
To conclude: by this their great skil in Anatomy, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up of beaſts, and taking out the nerves and ſinews, it
comes to paſſe that they are ſuch excellent Phyſitians, judging
of mans body by inſight into that of the beaſt, and of all the
diſeaſes incident thereunto: yet many a Chriſtian is forced to
pay for his phyſick with the loſſe of his life. Concerning
which matter if any one deſire to read more, I refer him to

               <p>The dame Bride upon the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the marriage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt waſh her
ſelf in cold water from top to toe, ſo
that her whole body be hid in the water. She is led to the
Bath, and likewiſe back again, by an attendance of gagling
women, making a certain confuſed noiſe as they go and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn:
to the end that every one may ſee and know that ſhe is
a Bride.</p>
               <p>The Girdle which the Bride ſends to the Bridegroom ought
to have ſilver ſtuds: but that which he ſends unto her, ought
to have thoſe which are of gold. A Iew upon a certain time
to ſatisfie me in my requeſt, gave me the reaſon hereof, to
wit, that the ſilver repreſented the ſeed of the man, which
is white: the gold the ſeed of the woman, which is red: a fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
and fooliſh reaſon, as the moſt of their others are.</p>
               <p>Upon the day whereon the Bride is to be led into the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
to receive a bleſſing, ſhe puts on her wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
decking, trimming, and dreſſing her ſelf in the Iewiſh
faſhion, as finely as ſhe can poſſibly: ſhe being ready dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
ſhe is led along by her Maids and Damoſels, who ſing
Marriage Songs, and Bridal-Ballads, bringing her into a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
chamber or cloſet, and placing her in a rich and coſtly
Chair, where they comb her head, truſs up her locks, deck her
with Fillets, adorn her with Ribbands, beautifie her with
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:40423:141"/>
Garlands, put a vail over her face, and that for modeſties
ſake, as <hi>Rebeckah</hi> did when ſhe was to meet her husband <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While the women are combing her head, they expreſſe a
great deal of mirth and jollity, skipping, ſinging, laughing,
dancing, and all to keep the ſpleen of Dame Bride from over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
with melancholy, which they are conceited to be a
work moſt grateful and acceptable in the eyes of the Lord.
And that the women may more eaſily believe it, the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Rabbines in their Talmud do affirm, that God did the
like to <hi>Eve,</hi> when ſhe was to be given to <hi>Adam,</hi> plaiting her
hair, dreſſing her head and locks, and alſo did ſing, foot it,
and dance with her in Paradiſe: which they ſtrive to prove

as though he had brought her skipping, and leading the dance,

upon <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> like a Serving-man while the
marriage was in finiſhing, and that he made the Canopie with
his own hands under which they were to receive the bleſſing:

the Bride and the Bridegroom by his inſtinct, have given

and reaching out the cup unto them, commands them to
drink thereof. If the Bride be a virgin, then the cup muſt
have a narrow mouth, if a widow a large one, at <hi>Wormes</hi>
they uſe an earthen cup, as alſo at other places. After that
they have both taſted of the cup, The Rabbine takes the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-ring
from the Bridegroom which is made of pure gold,
yet having no jewel in it, and calling ſome witneſſes ſhews
them the ring, and asketh whether it be a good one, and
worth the mony that was given for it; and then puts it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Brides finger, repeating the letters of contract with a
loud voice. Which being ended, he takes another glaſs of
wine, bleſſing and praying over it, giving thanks unto God
that the Bride and Bridgroom had mutually accepted one of
another. Then reaching them the Cup and bidding them
drink thereof, which when they have done accordingly, the
Bridegroom takes the Cup and throws it againſt the wall in
remembrance of the ruinated temple of Jeruſalem. In ſome
places they are wont to throw aſhes upon the Bridegrooms
head for the ſame end and purpoſe. And hence alſo it comes
to paſs, that the Bridegroom wears upon his head a hood of
a black colour, ſuch an one as mourners uſe: and the Bride a
cloak all rough and hairy, able to fright a childe out of its wits,
to ſhew unto us that in their greateſt jollity they ought to
afflict and humble themſelves for the deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>That this their marriage or coupling together is celebrated
abroad in open aire without covert, the reaſon is becauſe they
ought to multiply even as the ſtars of heaven for multitude.
When the marriage is ended they ſit down to dinner, the
Bridgroom muſt ſay grace, and is bound to ſing a long prayer
and thankſgiving: and the ſweeter he ſings the better he
pleaſeth his bride, and indeed he doth it rather out of pride
and to pleaſe her, then for any glory to God. While he is
ſinging, others are calling for the hens to be brought and ſet
upon the table. The Brides meſs conſiſts of an henn and egge
ſerved in together in one diſh. the Bridegroom carves a
little of the hen and gives it to his bride: which ſo soon as he
hath laid upon her trencher, the reſt of the gueſts behaving
themſelves more like hungry dogs then men, catching at, and
with both hands pulling in pieces the hens before them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
them in a moment. He that can get moſt being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the worthieſt man at the table. Every one eats what
he catches without help of either knife or trencher, he that
hath firſt done begins to ſnatch what he can from his fellow:
yea ſomtimes out of his very mouth, cauſing thereby a great
deal of fooliſh ſtirr and much laughter; and all this they doe
to make the new-married couple marry and jocund.</p>
               <p>The egge which we ſaid is uſed to be ſerved in together
with the hen is alwayes raw, which they are wont to caſt one
at anothers face, not ſparing a ſtranger of Chriſtian if he be
invited and there preſent. The foreſaid egge is set before the
Bride to comfort her, and let her know that ſhe ſhall bring
forth her children eaſily, without pain and grief: even as a
hen bringeth forth an egge, with that eaſe that ſhe expreſſeth
it by her cockling voice of joy and gladneffe. After theſe
ſports and childiſh fooleries, they fall to feaſt their bellies in
good earneſt. after dinner they dance many Giggs, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
Currantos, an when they are about to depart and to
put a period to theſe nuptial ſports, dance a dance called <hi>Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuah,</hi>
The <hi>commandment,</hi> or marriage <hi>pavin,</hi> becauſe it was
commanded by God himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:40423:143"/>
This they dance in this manner, the chief man at the table
takes the Bridegroom by the hand, he another, and ſo every
one his fellow, even ſo many as have any skill in dancing, takes
one another by the hand. So likewiſe the chief mation and
moſt honourable woman in the company joynes hands with
the Bride, and all the reſt one with another. Dancing hand
in hand and making a great noiſe with their feet, and in this
manner put an end to their marriage rites and ſports: which
commonly endure for the ſpace of eight dayes together. If
the marriage day chance upon the Sabbath, then their dancing
meaſures are quite out of meaſure, thinking that thereby they
honour the Sabbath in an extraordinary kinde, becauſe the
Sabbath is called a ſpouſe as we formerly declared. A great
care muſt be had that no uncircumciſed Chriſtian be invited
to the marriage, for <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>The heart knowes the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
of his ſoule, and a ſtranger</hi> (that is a Chriſtian) ſhall not
be made partaker of his joy, thus wreſting the Scripture to a
ſenſe clean contrary.</p>
               <p>Moreover, they write that the Angels ſeeing the Chriſtians
at their marriages do preſently depart, and devils enter the
place, doing much dammage, in ſtirring up ſtrife, brawlings,
jarrings, ſlips and falls, breaking armes and ſhins, murther,
and what not. Hence we may ſee how willingly they ſuffer
Chriſtians to be preſent at their marriages.</p>
               <p>When they pledge a health they ſay, <hi>Lochajim tobhim,</hi> God
grant it may be for your health; but if they like not the man
who drinks to them, as a Chriſtian, by the foreſaid words
they underſtand an imprecation or curſe. <hi>Relalah,</hi> for this
one word in their Cabbaliſtical computation comprehends the
two former: willing hereby to ſhew that they wiſh he may

barefoot upon the ground, in which ſpace they are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:40423:151"/>
either to eat fleſh or drink wine, whether they be the
children of the deceaſed or ſome of his kinsfolks. Yet upon
the ſabbath dayes and other feſtivals, a diſpenſation is granted
unto them in honour of theſe dayes, For the ſpace of thirty
dayes together they muſt not goe into the bath, nor to the
barber. They muſt not annoint themſelves with oyle or ſweet
water, not cut their nailes &amp;c. The man who mournes for
the dead muſt eat his meat with men: the woman with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
They idle become careleſs of their worldly affairs,
breathing nothing out but the doleful accents of grief and
ſorrow. He that mourns eats none of his own bread: his
friends who come to viſit him, make him partaker of ſuch
victuals as they bring with them. In the firſt place they give
him a diſh of egges to feed upon, and that for his comfort;
for as egges are round and circular, ſo is death alſo wheeling
about now to one, then to another.</p>
               <p>The children bemoan their deceaſed parents for a whole
year together: the ſurviving ſon of the deceaſed father is tied
every day for the ſpace of eleven moneths, to ſay a certain
prayer called <hi>Kaddiſch</hi> before mentioned, by the virtue of
which prayer, the Rabbines write and beleeve that his father
ſhall be delivered out of purgatory. The wicked remain in
purgatory for twelve moneths, but they who have led their
life in a more godly manner are delivered ſooner. Hereupon
it comes to paſs, that the children commonly pray for their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
the ſpace of an eleven years, becauſe there is not any
who would have his father accounted for a reprobate. That
the father may be delivered by ſuch a prayer, they prove out
of a certain ſtory, rather an old wives tale recorded in the
book, <hi>Brandſpicilegium</hi> in the tract <hi>Calah Rabbi Akibha,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a certain time being travelling, he met a man carrying a
load of wood, which neither any horſe or aſſe was able to
carry. <hi>Rabbi Akibhah</hi> inquired of him whether he was a man
or a ghoſt. He anſwered, I was once a man, but now being
dead I am compelled every day to carry ſuch a heavie load of
wood into purgatory, and to this end that there I may ſuffer a
miſerable ſcorching for my ſins which I committed in my life
time, ſo that I may more fitly be compared to an aſſe then a
man. Hereupon the Rabbine further enquired of him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:40423:152"/>
he had left a ſon behinde him? what was his wives
name, as alſo his ſons name? In what City they dwelt? All
which when he had declared unto him, the Rabbine inſtantly
going into the ſaid City, happened to meet with his ſon;
whom he taught the prayer <hi>Kaddiſch,</hi> commanding him to
repeat the ſame daily for his deceaſed father, for by this means
it ſhould come to paſs that he ſhould be delivered out of
purgatory.</p>
               <p>The ſon when he had learned the prayer, and had often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
it for his deceaſed father; the father appeared to the
foreſaid Rabbine in a viſion by night, and giving him thanks
that he had freed him from ſo great torment, as being the
cauſe of his delivery out of Purgatory, and confeſſed that he
was now at length thence delivered, and tranſlated into the
garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> Paradiſe. Hereupon the Rabbine made all
the Schools of the Jews partakers of this hiſtory by his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
annexing alſo this injunction, that every childe ſhould
ſay ſuch a prayer for his deceaſed father. And hereupon it
comes to paſs, that the father of a Jew departs this life with
great joy and conſolation, knowing that he hath left a ſon
behinde him that will pray for him. If one have no childe,
the whole Synagogue prayes for him upon their Sabbath and
feſtival dayes. By theſe and ſuch like fables, the profound
Rabbines inſtill the Jewiſh religion into their yonglings, that
by this means they may become pious and learned Jews; yea,
hence they are wont to boaſt before the nations of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
wiſdom and ſanctity far exceeding the vulgar holineſs.</p>
               <p>It is alſo provided, that a lampe ſhould burn for ſeven dayes
together, in honour of the ſoule of the deceaſed party: for
the ſoule of any dying man is wont to return to the place
where he gave up the ghoſt, and dolefully to lament over his
dear conſort the body.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as the man is dead they caſt all the water in the
houſe out of doors, that they who paſs by, may be warned
of the deceaſe of ſome perſon there. Others have recorded
that they do this thing in memory of the Propheteſs <hi>Miriam,</hi>
of whom it is written:<note place="margin">Num. 20. 1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>All the Congregation of Iſrael came
into the wilderneſs of</hi> Sin, <hi>in the firſt moneth, and the people
remain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:40423:152"/>
And when there was no water for the Congregation, they gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
themſelves together againſt Moſes and Aaron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Talmudiſts say that the occaſion hereof is this:<note place="margin">Tract Aboda Zara, c. 8.</note> the
Angel of death who hath deprived the man of life, waſhing
his knife or ſword in the water poiſons it; for they write,
that Satan or the meſſenger of death ſtanding at the beds-head
with a drawen ſword in his hand; upon which ſword hang
three drops of gall: which as ſoon as the ſick man beholds,
being terrified at the ſight, he opens his mouth, whereupon
theſe three drops fall into it. By reaſon of the firſt he gives
up the ghoſt: the ſecond makes him become yellow and pale:
the laſt cauſeth him to putrifie.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as the ſick man dieth, the Angel runs to the waters,
waſheth his ſword in them: by which means they being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with poiſon, are to be powred out.</p>
               <p>Again, this is one of the beſt grounds of the Jewiſh faith,
<hi>Antonius Margarita</hi> in his tract of Tabernacles, or Booths,
writes, that the Jews in ancient times were accuſtomed to
pray unto God, that he would not ſuffer the Angel of death
any longer to appear in ſuch a fearful ſhape at their beds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
and that alſo they had their requeſt granted: and that
they their anceſtors put out his left eye conjuring and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him by the holy names of God.</p>
               <p>It is alſo recorded in the Talmud, that great honour ought
to be given unto them who have departed this life, becauſe
they in the other world have perfect knowledge of all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
in this.</p>
               <p>They write alſo that the ſoule doth not preſently upon the
diſſolution return into heaven from whence it came, but that
for twelve moneths ſpace it becomes a vagabond through the
earth, returns into the Sepulchre, ſuffers many torments in
purgatory: and then twelve moneths fully expired, it aſcends
up into heaven there taking its reſt. The queſtion being
propoſed in the book called <hi>Schebhet Jehudah,</hi> in a certain
diſputation betwixt a Jew and a Chriſtian: How it came to
paſs that the dead ſhould know all things that are done here
upon earth? It is anſwered, that the ſoule doth not gain an
entrance into heaven, untill the body that was buried be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into duſt; and therefore it remaining ſo long a time upon
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:40423:153"/>
the earth, may without contradiction know the things which
are done here below. That the ſoule doth not preſently goe
into heaven, is manifeſt out of the words of Solomon. <hi>The
duſt ſhall return unto the earth from whence it was, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to God that gave it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 12. 7.</note> In this place they ſay, that by the <hi>duſt</hi>
is meant our bodie, which of neceſſity returns unto the earth,
out of which it was taken: and by the <hi>Spirit</hi> our ſoule which
returns to God that gave it: now then to conclude, the body
muſt firſt be made duſt and aſhes, and then the Spirit ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
unto the Creator, which if it were otherwiſe, certainly
<hi>Solomon</hi> had inverted his words, and propounded them thus;

               <p>
                  <hi>Elias</hi> the famous Grammarian, in his dictionary called <hi>Tiſbi,</hi>
expounding the word <hi>Chabat</hi> hath left it in record, that it
was the opinion of their Rabbines, that ſo ſoon as any of the
Jews do take their farewell of this t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

chamberlain death hath furniſhed him with a lodging in the
lower parts of the earth, that the Angel of death comes and
ſits upon his ſepulchre; and that at the same time the ſoule
returns into the body, reanimates and erects it. Whereupon,
the Angel takes an iron chain, the one part of which is hot,
the other cold, with which he ſmites the dead corpes two
times or more. At the firſt ſtroke all the members of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
are torn one from another; At the ſecond all the bones
are diſperſed abroad, at the third, fleſh and bones, yea, the
whole carcaſs is turned into duſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and aſhes; Then come the
good Angels and gather the bones together, honouring them
with a ſecond burial. This puniſhment the Rabbines call
<hi>Chibbut hakkeber,</hi> which they do not only write of, but alſo
moſt abſurdly believe, in their common prayer petitioning
that God would preſerve them againſt this puniſhment, and
divert it from them, as we may ſee in that petition which
they call <hi>Benſchen,</hi> being in the number of thoſe which they
uſe upon the day of reconciliation.</p>
               <p>It is written in the book <hi>Chaſidim</hi> that who is much given

world, but according to the Jews computation in the year
3761, we and they differing 202 years. And now becauſe
Chriſt came not unto them in great power, a king of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſtate (ſuch as were <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi>) to deliver them
from the tyranny of that uſurping <hi>Herod,</hi> and Roman cruelty,
neither with a rod of iron to break in pieces and deſtroy their
enemies: but only began his kingdom over them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the
ſpiritual ſcepter of his doctrine, even for this very cauſe they
would not receive him for the true Meſſias, though ſome few
did acknowledge and embrace him,<note place="margin">Luk. 2. 25.</note> and at that time the moſt
ancient and approved men amongſt them did expect his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
thus we finde a <hi>Simeon</hi> waiting for the conſolation of
Iſrael,<note place="margin">Ib. v. 38.</note> and <hi>Anna</hi> that old Propheteſs ſpeaking of him to all
that hoped for deliverance in Jeruſalem.<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 5.</note> The very ſame that
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that
though the Jews were moſt ingrateful, <hi>yet is there a remnant
of them according to the election of grace.</hi> Yea, when all king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
power, ſacerdotal honour and dignity was taken from
them, the city Jeruſalem made a ruinous heap, and their beauty
the temple turned into aſhes, every one now begins to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the time of the coming of the Meſſias to be paſt. Hence
it was that in the 52. years ufter the deſtruction of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
a certain proud and haughty Jew boaſting that he was
the true Meſſias, feared not to affirme himſelf the ſame of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:40423:154"/>
whom <hi>Balaam</hi> propheſied in theſe words:<note place="margin">Num. 2. 4. 17, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſhall ſee him, but
not now, I ſhall behold him, but not nigh: there ſhall come a ſtar
out of Jacob, and a Scepter ſhall riſe out of Iſrael, and he ſhall
ſmite the corners of Moab, and deſtroy all the children of Sheth.
And Edom ſhall be a poſſeſsion, Seir alſo ſhall be a poſſeſsion for his
enemies, and Iſrael ſhall do valiantly.</hi> Others underſtood this
propheſie of the then newly begun kingdom of the Chriſtians.
But the Jews even at this day determine their Meſſias as yet
to come, and to fulfil thoſe things which <hi>Balaam</hi> foretold, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their ſubſtance. That the ſaid Jew ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
himſelf the Meſſias, was moſt grateful unto them: who
preſently in their own conceits can nouriſh hopes, that they
ſhould become the conquerours of the Romans, who a little
before had deſtroyed their City and Temple. This Seducer
following the letter of the propheſie, names himſelf, <hi>Ben
Chocab,</hi> which is by interpretation, the ſon of a Star. His
chief follower, who at the very firſt clave unto him, was <hi>Rabbi
Akibha,</hi> a man of great learning, who had under his tuition
twenty four thouſand Scholars, proclaiming him to be <hi>Malka
Meſchiccha,</hi> Chriſt the King. By this means much people
went after him; inſomuch, that he chuſed unto himſelf the
City <hi>Bittera</hi> for the ſeat of his kingdom. But when that <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
the Roman Emperour, had after a ſiege of three years and
an half taken and killed this their Meſſias, and together with
this beautiful Star had miſerably ſlaughtered more then four
hundred thouſand Jews,<note place="margin">

for the Meſſias, as you may read in a book called <hi>Schebhet

               <p>The iſſue of all is this; that the Jews convicted in their own

the longer they ſhall reign, the greater and heavier will the
burdens be which they ſhall impoſe upon the children of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.
There ſhall alſo come certain men from the ends of the

Iſraelites ſhould fall out of the fire into the pit, but ſpeaking
unto the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhall ſay unto him, Come thou and ſit at
my right hand, and to the children of Iſrael, ſit you ſtill,
hold your peace, and quietly expect that great deliverance
which the Lord this day will impart unto you. Then ſhall

that what thing ſoever God created in the world he created it

ſhould augment the number, and at length by there monſtrous
magnitude and multitude deſtroy the whole world, God
gelded the male, and killed the female, reſerving her in pickle

he created that great ox called <hi>Behemoth</hi> feeding on a thouſand

reſerving it for the Jewes diet in time to come, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:

breaking in the full drowned three ſcore villages. By this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:40423:161"/>
may alſo collect how glorious a diſh the Meſſias is to make

I think) found in the land of Judah, none ought to think that
which is reported of this to be fabulous.<note place="margin">The Crow. <hi>Babha baſra.</hi> c. 5. p. 72.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the forementioned book of the Talmud, we read of a
certain great crow which was ſeen of a Rabbine, worthy to
be credited. The relation runs thus. <hi>Rabbi barchannah</hi> ſaith,
At a certain time I ſaw a frog, which is as great as the village
<hi>Akra</hi> in <hi>Hagronia,</hi> well how big was the village? It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
of no fewer then threeſcore houſes. Then came a
mighty ſerpent and ſwallowed up this frog. Inſtantly upon
this, a great crow flying that way picked up as a ſmall morſel
both the frog and the ſerpent; and taking him to flight ſat
upon a Tree, now think with your ſelves how great and ſtrong
this tree muſt be. To which <hi>Rabbi papa</hi> the ſon of <hi>Samuel</hi>
making anſwer, unleſs I had been in the place, and with theſe
mine eyes ſeen the very tree, I would not have beleeved it.
Thus much the Talmudiſt. Who dare give the lie to this
<hi>Rabbine?</hi> When that good man <hi>Kimchi</hi> commenting on
the fifty Pſalm, and explaining the word Ziz hath there wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed
that <hi>Rabbi Judah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Simeon</hi> did avouch Ziz to
be a bird of that bigneſs,<note place="margin">The great bird. ziz.</note> that when he ſpreads abroad his
wings he hides the body of the ſun, and wraps the world in
darkneſs. Furthermore, on a certain time, a certain <hi>Rabbine</hi>
was upon the ſea in a little ſhip, in the middle of which he
ſaw a bird ſtanding of ſuch an height,<note place="margin">Talmud in the ſame place.</note> that water came only
to her knees: which the <hi>Rabbine</hi> obſerving, beſpeaks his
companions that there they might waſh themſelves ſeeing the
water was not deep. But a voice from heaven hindred the
attempt, ſaying unto the <hi>Rahbine,</hi> ſee that thou do it not:
for now ſeven whole years are gone and paſt, ſince a certain
man let a hatchet fall in this very place, which hath been ever
ſince a falling, and is not as yet come to the bottome. By which
a man may eaſily gather how long legs this bird had, and how
great her body ought to be in proportion to her feet. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt theſe birds keep their reſidence in the wood <hi>Ela,</hi>
in which,<note place="margin">The great Lion <hi>Cholin.</hi> cap. 3. p. 59.</note> a Lion is reported to live of ſuch an unheard of por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicture,
that only to relate would ſtrike a man with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
Of this Lion the Talmud thus fables. When up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:40423:161"/>
on a certain time the Emperor of <hi>Rome</hi> asked <hi>Rabbi Joſuah</hi> the
ſon of <hi>Hananiah,</hi> what the reaſon was why their God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
himſelf unto a Lion; and whether he was of ſo great
ſtrength that he could kill a Lion? the <hi>Rabbine</hi> made anſwer,
that God did not compare himſelf unto an ordinary Lion, but
unto ſuch an one as lived in the wood <hi>Fla:</hi> to whom the
Prince replied, ſhew me that Lion. Then the <hi>Rabbine</hi> by
prayer obtained of God that the lion ſhould leave the wood,
and come, when hs was yet foure hundred miles diſtant from
the Emperour, he roared ſo terribly, that all the women with
child in Rome became abortive, and the walls of the City fell
flat unto the ground. When he had come an hundred miles
nearer, he the ſecond time roared ſo fearefully that all the teeth
of the Romanes fell out of their heads, &amp; the Emperour falling
from his throne, lay proſtrate upon the earth half dead; who
with vehement entreaties begs of the Rabbin to ſend back the
Lion; which was likewiſe put in execution. But theſe fables
draw us too far from the ſmell of that faſt which the Meſſias
hath provided for the Jews in the land of promiſe.</p>

Among the honourable women which the <hi>Moſſias</hi> ſhall have,
ſhall be the daughters of Kings. For every King of the earth
ſhall eſteem himſelf highly graced, ſo that he may give his

               <p>Briefly, the happineſs of this holy people ſhall at that
time be ſo immeaſurable, that neither can the heart of man
conceive it, or the tongue yeeld the leaſt expreſſion thereof.
Which things thus ordered and declared, leaving the Iewes
in this their proſperous eſtate, I will put a period to my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and hide the ſecret of their faith from the Chriſtians;
ſeeing I have attempted more then they themſelves, if they
could have ruled the matter, would have permitted. What I
have done already will not be pleaſing unto them, in which I
have expoſed to every mans eye the full anatomy of their life
and belief.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtian Reader may eaſily perceive by that which
hath been ſaid, that the faith of the Jews and their whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
is not grounded upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> but upon meer lies, falſe
and forged conſtitutions, fables of the Rabbines, and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of ſeduced Phariſees. And that therefore it ought no
more to iſſue out of the mouth of a Chriſtian, that the Jewes
ſtand for the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 8.</note> but rather with <hi>Jeremy,</hi> that they
are ſtrong defendants of the falſe worſhip of the true God,
not ſuffering themſelves any way to be drawn from it. And
with our Saviour to affirm,<note place="margin">Matth. 15. 5.</note> that <hi>they make the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God of none effect by their traditions;</hi> in vain they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him, when they teach nothing but the mandates of men:
honouring him with their lips, but in their hearts are far
from him.<note place="margin">Titus 1.</note> In their words they profeſſe to know God, but in
their works they deny him: theſe are the men whom the Lord
abhors, who being diſobedient unto his word are unto every
good work reprobate, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath recorded. By
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:40423:164"/>
which it is more manifeſt then the light of the Sun at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide,
that the puniſhment is now fallen heavie upon them
wherewith <hi>Moſes</hi> threatned them: that <hi>the Lord ſhould ſmite
them with madneſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>blindnesse, and aſtoniſhment of heart, that
they ſhould grope at noon day as the blinde gropeth in darkneſſe.</hi>
And this appears moſt clearly, and is more then evident from
this, that they miſerably pervert, and contrary to all reaſon
with an impudent front inveſted with a dull ignorance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
and interpret the word of God.</p>
               <p>O merciful God, who haſt vouchſafed to impart this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
favour unto us Chriſtians, that we being warned by ſuch
an horrible example of the divine wrath, ſhould with awe and
reverence embrace his holy word, leſt the ſame things ſhould
befal us, and ſo our Candleſtick ſhould be removed for our
ingratitude, God of his mercy grant, that the Sun of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
may alwayes ſhine in our hearts until perfect day, and
by the illumination of his good Spirit conduct us unto all
truth. Amen.</p>
