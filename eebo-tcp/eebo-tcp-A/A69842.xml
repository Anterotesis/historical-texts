         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves, and among others, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by <hi>Don Bartholomew de las Caſas</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Chiapa,</hi> who made large Complaints of theſe Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties
<pb facs="tcp:57864:4"/>
to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to the Royal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
for the <hi>Indies,</hi> with a deſign to put a ſtop to 'em
if poſſible. That he is a Perſon of irreproachable
Credit in this caſe, will appear by the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
wherein he challenges all the World to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the truth of the matters of Fact he aſſerts,
while he ſtood the Teſt of a Court who could eaſily
have detected him, if he had attempted to impoſe on
'em by a malicious Falſhood.</p>
                  <p>This Biſhop writes with ſuch an Air of Honeſty,
Sincerity, and Charity, as would very well have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
one of a better Religion than that in which he
had the unhappineſs to be educated. It may well ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
the Reader to hear a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prelat declaim
ſo loudly againſt Perſecution, and plead ſo freely for
Liberty of Conſcience in a Country ſubjugated to
the Inquiſition. To hear him in his diſpute againſt
Doctor <hi>Sepulueda,</hi> decry all methods of Violence for
the propagation of the Truth, as more ſutable to
the Maxims of Mahometiſm than the Principles of
Chriſtianity: To hear him aſſert the Natural Right
of all Mankind to Liberty and Property, and inveigh
againſt all Vſurpation and Tyranny in the ſmarteſt
Terms, is enough to move any one's Wonder, and Pity
too, when on the other hand 'tis obſerv'd how much
he magnifies the Power and Authority of the Pope in
ſome of his Propoſitions contain'd in the following
Treatiſe. But all may ſerve to convince one how great
an advantage or diſadvantage a Man has as he
pleads the Cauſe of Truth or Error; and of the
great difference there is between the genuin Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of Reaſon and good Senſe, and the ſervil
Prejudices of Bigotry and Superſtition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:57864:4"/>
'Tis no leſs a Subject of Admiration that a Book
of this ſtamp, which reflects ſo ſharply on Perſecution
and Tyranny, ſhould ſee the light <hi>cum privilegio</hi> at
this time of day in <hi>France,</hi> where the Civil and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Liberty of Subjects have not been provided
for with the utmoſt Care, where the Will of the
Prince has long ſince been the Law, and Dragoons
of late years the principal Miſſionaries for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>This Treatiſe was firſt compos'd in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> in the
beginning of the Reign of <hi>Charles V.</hi> and was
long ſince tranſlated and printed in more Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
than one; but having lately receiv'd a new
dreſs in Modern French at <hi>Paris,</hi> 'tis hop'd this
Tranſlation from the <hi>French</hi> will not be unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Engliſh Nation. I'm ſure the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
Principles of the Biſhop of <hi>Chiapa</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Property and Liberty both Civil and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
are more agreeable to the Genius and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of this Iſland, than to the preſent temper of
that part of the Continent which lies neareſt to it;
and ſo this Book may expect at leaſt as favorable a
reception in this Nation as in that where it has
been lately publiſh'd.</p>
                  <p>What the Biſhop ſays here and there in favor of
his own Religion, is ſo weak, and has been ſo often
exploded here and every where elſe where the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
has obtain'd, that 'twould be unneceſſary to
confute any of thoſe Popiſh Fancies in this Preface.
'Tis enough for me that I have faithfully diſcharg'd
the part of a Tranſlator. And if ſome particular
things occur more than once, it muſt be conſider'd on
the one hand, that the Biſhop had need to mention
<pb facs="tcp:57864:5"/>
them on divers occaſions, as when he diſputed, and
when he wrote his Arguments for the uſe of the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> &amp;c. and on the other, that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of the Affair, and the Greatneſs of his
Zeal to have the Grievances he complain'd of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd,
made ſo deep an Impreſſion of ſome things on
his Mind that he could not forbear to repeat 'em.</p>
                  <p>As for the Tranſlation it ſelf, I hope thoſe that
ſhall have the Curioſity to compare it with the French
Copy, will find that I have done it Juſtice. And
if there is not that exactneſs of Method and Stile
the preſent Age expects, it may be the better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd,
when 'tis conſider'd how long ſince the Original
was compos'd. However, the extraordinary things
contain'd in this Hiſtory will make ſufficient amends
for any Defects in the Compoſition of the Biſhop of
<hi>Chiapa,</hi> and for the abrupt Tranſitions ſometimes
us'd by the Compiler of this Treatiſe in putting the
Biſhop's ſeveral Pieces together, of which it almoſt
wholly conſiſts.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only add, That as no Hiſtory in the World
can parallel this for the inhuman ſlaughter of ſuch
vaſt numbers of People; ſo theſe Barbarities, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the bloody Croiſades in the 12<hi>th</hi> and
13<hi>th</hi> Centuries, as well as the many Perſecutions
and Maſſacres ſince the Reformation, render it no
difficult matter to diſcern to what Church that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
Character agrees, that <hi>in her was found</hi>
not only <hi>the Blood of Prophets and of Saints,</hi> but
<hi>of all that were ſlain upon the Earth.</hi> Rev.

                  <head>A
RELATION
OF THE
VOYAGES and CRUELTIES
Of the SPANIARDS in the
WEST-INDIES.</head>
                  <div type="introduction">
                     <p>THE <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> were diſcover'd in the
Year 1492; the year after the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
ſetled there, and inhabited this new
World. But for the ſpace of theſe 49
years laſt paſt, an infinite number of People have
left <hi>Spain</hi> to dwell in theſe Countries: they generally
touch at <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> which is a very fertile and large
Iſland, and is become very famous: The Extent of
it is above 600 Leagues; 'tis ſurrounded with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of ſmall Iſlands, and abounds ſo with Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
that there's no Country in the World more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous.
The Continent, which is above 250 Leagues
diſtant from it, is of a vaſt Extent; a great part of
which has been already diſcovered, and freſh Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
are made every day: and ſuch great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of People inhabit all theſe Countries, that it
ſeems as if Providence had amaſs'd together the
greateſt part of Mankind in this part of the World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="2" facs="tcp:57864:10"/>
All theſe People are naturally ſimple, they know
not what belongs to Policy and Addreſs, to Trick and
Artifice; but are very obedient and faithful to their
rightful Governors: They are Humble, Patient,
and Submiſſive, even to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
and enſlav'd 'em: they love to live quietly, and
are enemies to diſputes and quarrels, hardly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what 'tis to be malicious, and ſeldom meditating
Revenge.</p>
                     <p>They are a weak effeminate People, not capable
of enduring great Fatigues; they care not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to Toil and Labour, and their Life is of no long
continuance; their Conſtitution is ſo nice, that a
ſmall fit of Sickneſs carries 'em off. The Children
of their Princes and Nobility, are in all reſpects
dealt with like thoſe of the meaneſt Subjects: in
which they differ much from our <hi>Europeans,</hi> among
whom the Children of Kings and great Men, are
brought up with all the delicacy and tenderneſs ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.</p>
                     <p>The People of this Iſland are ſo very poor, that
they live in the want of almoſt every thing; they
are very cool and indifferent in the purſuit of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Advantages, and ſeem not to be inclin'd to
Pride and Ambition; their way of living is ſo fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,
that the antient Hermites in the Wilderneſs
were ſcarce more Sober and Abſtemious. All the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
in general go naked, only they have the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
to wear a ſort of Apron about their Waſte.
They ſometimes uſe a kind of ſhaggy Covering, or
a piece of Cloth an Ell or two long: Thoſe of the
beſt Faſhion lie on Beds made with Girts tyed in
Knots at the four Corners: their Apprehenſion is
quick and ſubtile, therefore they are very docile,
capable of receiving the impreſſions of ſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and eaſily inclin'd to embrace the Principles
of the Catholick Religion: They are no Enemies to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57864:10"/>
good Manners, but have a greater diſpoſition to Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
than many other Nations, becauſe their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Life is free from that care and diſtraction in
which the perplexity of Buſineſs involves others.
The very firſt Ideas and Inſtructions that are given
'em of our Religion, kindle in their Souls ſo great a
deſire to the Sacraments and Divine Service of our
Church, that thoſe Monks that inſtruct 'em, have
need of a great deal of Patience to moderate the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity
of their Minds, and to anſwer all the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
they have the curioſity to ask. And it may
truly be ſaid that theſe Indian Nations would be the
moſt happy in the World, if endued with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the true God. The Spaniards themſelves
who have treated 'em ſo ill, cannot but confeſs the
goodneſs of their natural Temper, and the great
diſpoſition of their minds to every kind of Vertue.</p>
                     <p>The Almighty ſeems to have inſpir'd theſe People
with a meekneſs and ſoftneſs of Humour like that of
Lambs: and the Spaniards who have given 'em ſo
much Trouble, and fallen upon 'em ſo fiercely, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
ſavage Tigers, Wolves, and Lions, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
with preſſing Hunger. They applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
forty years together wholly to the maſſacring
the poor Wretches that inhabited the Iſlands;
putting them to all kinds of unheard of Torments
and Puniſhments, (a part of which Cruelties exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
on theſe miſerable <hi>Indians</hi> we deſign to deſcribe
in the ſequel of this Work) inſomuch that this Iſland
which before the arrival of the Europeans, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about three Millions of People, is now reduc'd to
leſs than three hundred. The Iſland of <hi>Cuba,</hi> the
length of which is equal to the diſtance between
<hi>Validolid</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> is entirely deſert and deſtitute
of its Inhabitants, and nothing but Ruins now to be
ſeen in it. The Iſlands of St. <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Jamaica,</hi>
have met with the like Treatment, which were
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57864:11"/>
very fertile and populous, but are render'd deſolate
and waſte by the like means. The Iſlands near <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi>
and <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> on the North-ſide are ſixty in
number, which are commonly call'd the Iſles of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
of which the leaſt fruitful abounds more with
Plenty than the Royal Garden of <hi>Seville;</hi> but they
are deſtitute of Inhabitants, tho 'tis as wholeſom
an Air as men can breath in. When the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
firſt landed in theſe Iſles, there were above five
hundred thouſand Souls; they cut the Throats of a
great part of theſe, and carried away the reſt by
force to make 'em work in the Mines of <hi>Hiſpaniola.</hi>
When ſome pious Perſons embarked to viſit theſe
Iſles after the Ravage the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had made in 'em,
they found but eleven People left there: It was from
the motives of Charity and Compaſſion they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
this difficult and perilous Voyage, in hope to
inſtruct theſe poor Creatures in the knowledg of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt. Above 30 Iſles near that of St. <hi>John</hi> were
entirely depopulated, tho of a vaſt Extent, ſo that
there is ſcarce an Inhabitant to be found in them.</p>
                     <p>As for the Continent 'tis certain, and what I my
ſelf know to be true, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have ruined
ten Kingdoms there, bigger than all <hi>Spain,</hi> by the
commiſſion of all ſorts of Barbarity and unheard of
Cruelties. They have driven away or kill'd all the
Inhabitants; ſo that all theſe Kingdoms are deſolate
to this day, and reduc'd to a moſt deplorable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
tho this was formerly the beſt peopled
Country in the World. We dare aſſert, without
fear of incurring the reproach of exaggerating, that
in the ſpace of thoſe forty years in which the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
exercis'd their intolerable Tyranny in this new
World, they unjuſtly put to death above twelve
Millions of People, counting Men, Women, and
Children: and it may be affirm'd without injury to
Truth, upon a juſt Calculation, that during this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57864:11"/>
ſpace of Time, above fifty Millions have died in
theſe Countries.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> who invaded theſe Iſles, and boaſted
of their Chriſtianity, made uſe of two ways prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
to exterminate the Inhabitants: the firſt of
which was by an unjuſt and bloody War carried on
with the utmoſt Barbarity and Cruelty; the other
was that deteſtable Policy which inſpir'd them to
maſſacre all that had any remains of Liberty, or
endeavour'd to ſhake off their Tyrannical Yoke, and
to free themſelves from ſo unjuſt and intolerable a
Slavery; for this the braveſt, moſt potent, and moſt
warlike Nations off the <hi>Indians</hi> attempted. When
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had kill'd all the Men in the War, they
ſuffer'd the Women and Children to live, but with
the impoſition of a Yoke ſo cruel and inſupportable,
that their Condition was rendred as miſerable as that
of Beaſts. A multitude of other particular methods
were taken for the deſtruction of theſe poor <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans,</hi>
but they may be reduc'd in general to thoſe
two we have mentioned.</p>
                     <p>The Gold and Silver theſe People had in their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
was the Motive that violently prompted the
<hi>Europeans</hi> to perſecute and deſtroy 'em. The ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
deſire they had of ſpeedily enriching themſelves,
in order to procure ſuch Honour and Dignity as far
exceeded their Condition, inſpir'd 'em with all this
inhumanity. In a word, their Avarice and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were arriv'd to an exceſs beyond Imagination;
the immenſe Riches of the new World, the tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
ſweet, and good diſpoſition of the <hi>Indians,</hi>
which render'd a deſcent into their Country eaſy to
any that would attempt it, have occaſion'd all the
Ravage and Spoil, all the horrid Maſſacres and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties
which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have caus'd 'em to ſuffer.
They made ſo little account of the miſerable Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of theſe Iſlands, that I may aver, without
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57864:12"/>
fear of being accus'd either of Impoſture, or of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inconſiderately, ſince 'tis that of which I have
been an Eye-witneſs, that they valued them leſs, and
treated them worſe than Beaſts. They had ſo little
regard to the Salvation of their Souls, that they
would not give themſelves the trouble ſo much as to
ſpeak of the Chriſtian Faith and Sacraments to thoſe
numberleſs multitudes of Men and Women whom
they ſacrific'd to their Ambition and Tyranny. And
that which aggravates the enormity of their Crimes,
is, that theſe poor <hi>Indians</hi> had offer'd 'em no Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but on the contrary, gave 'em as much Honour
and Reſpect as if they had been ſent from Heaven;
till they were wearied out with repeated Outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and Maſſacres, and conſtrain'd to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Arms contrary to their inclination, and to
repel force by force, to ſecure themſelves from the
horrible Violences and Inſults of their Enemies, who
invented divers kinds of Torments for them, with
a Barbarity beyond all Deſcription.</p>

                        <head>A particular Account of what the Spaniards did
in Hiſpaniola.</head>
                        <p>AT this Iſland the <hi>Spaniards</hi> arriv'd in their firſt
Voyages, and here began to perſecute and
murder the <hi>Indians,</hi> taking away their Wives and
Children, and uſing 'em, or rather abuſing 'em at
their pleaſure. They devour'd all that theſe poor
Creatures had amaſs'd together for their Subſiſtence
with a great deal of Care and Labour, not content
with what they freely offer'd 'em as far as their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
and the meanneſs of their Condition would
permit: for they are ſatisfied with what is of pure
Neceſſity, not troubling themſelves with ſuperfluities,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57864:12"/>
or laying up great ſtores before hand. One <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi>
would conſume in a day, that which would
have ſuffic'd three <hi>Indian</hi> Families of ten Perſons
each, for the ſpace of a whole Month. This ill
treatment and ſpoil ſoon made the Inhabitants of
this Iſland loſe the Eſteem they had conceiv'd of the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom they at firſt look'd upon as meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
from Heaven: ſo that at length they began
to hide their Wives and Children, and whatever
Goods they had from 'em. Some retired into Caves,
others fled up into the Mountains to avoid meeting
with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who now appear'd ſo terrible and
cruel to 'em. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> did not content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to beat 'em, and to offer 'em many other
Indignities, but cut their Throats in cold Blood:
and without any reſpect either to Age or Quality,
put their Princes, and the Governors of their Cities
to death: They came to that height of Impudence and
Villany, that a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain had the Inſolence
to abuſe the Wife of the greateſt King of the
Iſland. This vile fact drove 'em quite to deſpair,
ſo that from that time they ſought means of dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of their Country; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
themſelves to Arms, and did what they could
to defend themſelves againſt theſe Tyrants: but
the Weapons they us'd were neither capable of
defending them, nor of offending their Enemies to
any purpoſe; and were more like thoſe that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
uſe to play with, than ſuch as are fit for Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to uſe in War.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were mounted on fine Horſes,
and armed with Lances and Swords, look'd upon
Enemies ſo meanly equip'd with the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and committed the moſt horrible Slaughters
with Impunity. They paſs'd through the ſeveral
Cities and Towns, ſparing neither Age nor Sex,
but kill'd Women and Children as well as Men:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57864:13"/>
They rip'd up Women with Child, that Root and
Branch might be deſtroy'd together. They laid
Wagers one with another, who ſhould cleave a Man
down with his Sword moſt dexterouſly at one blow;
or who ſhould take his Head from his Shoulders moſt
cleverly; or who ſhould run a Man through after
the moſt artificial manner: They tore away Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
out of their Mothers Arms, and daſh'd out
their Brains againſt the Rocks; others they threw
into the River, diverting themſelves with this bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
Sport, and giving great ſhouts while they ſaw
'em in this miſery: And to add inſulting Scoffs to
their Cruelty, advis'd 'em to ſtruggle in the Water,
and try if they could ſave themſelves from drowning.
They held up the Bodies of Mothers and Children
together upon their Lances: they ſet up Gibbets,
and hang'd up thirteen of theſe poor Creatures in
honour to Jeſus Chriſt and his twelve Apoſtles (as
they blaſphemouſly expreſs'd themſelves): They
kindled a great Fire under theſe Gibbets, to burn
thoſe they had hang'd upon 'em: They cut off the
Hands of thoſe they ſav'd alive, and ſent 'em away
in that miſerable condition, bidding 'em carry the
News of their Calamities to thoſe that were retir'd
into the Mountains to eſcape the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They erected a ſmall Scaffold, ſupported with
Forks and Poles, upon which to execute their Chiefs,
and thoſe of the moſt conſiderable quality among
'em. When they had laid 'em at length upon this
Scaffold, they kindled a gentle Fire, to make 'em
feel themſelves die gradually, till the poor Wretches
after the moſt exquiſite Pain and Anguiſh, attended
with horrible Screeches and Outcries, at length ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd.
I one day ſaw four or five Perſons of the
higheſt Rank in this Iſland burn'd after this manner.
But the dreadful Cries this Torment extorted from
'em, incommoding a Spaniſh Captain; and hindring
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57864:13"/>
his Sleep, he commanded 'em to be preſently
ſtrangled. But a certain Officer whoſe Name I
know, and whoſe Relations are well known at <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
put Gags into their Mouths to hinder 'em from
making a Noiſe, that he might not be depriv'd of
the brutiſh Pleaſure of broiling them gently, till
they breath'd out their Souls in this Torment. I
have been an Eye-witneſs of all theſe Cruelties, and
an infinite number of others which I paſs over in
ſilence.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe theſe poor People took all the care
they could to hide themſelves from a Generation of
Men ſo barbarous and wicked as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who
had no Sentiment of Humanity, Honour, or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
left, but acted as if they were made for nothing
elſe but to deſtroy Mankind; to add further to their
brutiſh Cruelty, they taught Dogs to go a hunting
for theſe poor Wretches, and to devour 'em as if they
had been Beaſts. And becauſe the <hi>Indians</hi> after
they had been provok'd with ſo many unheard of
Injuries, now and then kill'd one of them when
they met with 'em ſtragling; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made
a Law among themſelves to maſſacre a hundred <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
for every <hi>Spaniard</hi> they ſhould kill.</p>

                           <hi>HIſpaniola</hi> contains five great Kingdoms, the
Kings of which were very powerful, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
all the other Chiefs, whoſe number is very
great: yet there are ſome independent Countries
which have their particular Lords, and are not
ſubject to any of thoſe Kings. One of theſe Kings
they call <hi>Magua,</hi> which ſignifies a <hi>Plain,</hi> his Name
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57864:14"/>
being taken from the ſituation of his Kingdom,
which is extremely pleaſant. This Plain is 80
Leagues in extent from South to North, but is
only five, eight, and ſometimes ten Leagues in
breadth. 'Tis encompaſs'd on every ſide with high
Mountains; 'tis water'd with a great number of
Brooks and Rivers, of which there are twelve that
come not behind thoſe famous Rivers the <hi>Ebre,</hi>
the <hi>Duere,</hi> and the <hi>Guadalquivir</hi> for bigneſs. The
Rivers that water this Plain, eſpecially thoſe falling
down from a Mountain that looks towards the Weſt,
abound with Gold. This Mountain bounds the
Province of <hi>Cibao,</hi> where the Mines bearing that
Name produce that pure Gold of the fineneſs of
24 Carrats, ſo much talk'd of in <hi>Europe.</hi> The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
of this Kingdom was call'd <hi>Guarionex;</hi> he
had under him ſuch powerful Subjects, that one of
'em could bring 16000 Men into the field for
the King's Service. I knew ſome of theſe Indian
Lords. This King was very ſubmiſſive to the Kings
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and expreſs'd a great deal of Affection to
them. His Humour was mild and peaceable; and
his Soul capable of every Vertue. He once or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
all his Subjects to bring him each of 'em a
great Purſe of Gold; but finding they were not in a
condition to anſwer his Requirement, he remitted
half this Tax. The Inhabitants of this Iſland have
not the Art of extracting Gold out of the Mines.
This <hi>Cacique</hi> voluntarily offer'd himſelf to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> on condition the Queen
<hi>Iſabella</hi> would take care that thoſe Lands ſhould be
cultivated, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> inhabited at their
firſt Arrival in the <hi>Indies,</hi> extending about the ſpace
of 50 Leagues towards <hi>St. Domingo:</hi> for he ſaid his
Subjects had no Experience or Skill to extract Gold
out of the Mines. If this Condition had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
he would faithfully and joyfully have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57864:14"/>
his Promiſe, which would have been of vaſt
advantage to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who might have
taken above three Millions of Gold every year out
of theſe Mines; and conſequently there might now
have been fifty Cities in this Province as fine as
<hi>Seville.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But what greateful Acknowledgments did the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> return to the kind Offers of this Prince,
who gave ſuch Proofs of his Good-will to 'em, and
ſincere deſire to ſerve 'em? They cover'd him with
Shame and Infamy, his Wife was violated (as has
been ſaid) by a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain, a Wretch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of the Chriſtian Name. This Prince might
have waited for an opportunity to revenge himſelf
of this Outrage, but choſe rather to retire and live
in Obſcurity and Exile in the Province of one of his
Subjects, voluntarily abidicating his Kingdom and
Government. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> being inform'd of the
place of his Retreat, purſued him with the utmoſt
Fury, without giving him time to hide himſelf. They
cruelly declar'd War againſt that Indian Lord that
had given him Sanctuary, and had receiv'd him with
a becoming Humanity and Reſpect; they ravag'd
all his Country, and never left off their Cruelties
till they had found and ſeiz'd this Fugitive Prince,
whom they loaded with Chains, and put on Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
to be carried into <hi>Spain</hi> as their Priſoner.
This Veſſel was caſt away in the Voyage, a great
many <hi>Spaniards</hi> drown'd, and an incredible ſum of
Gold and Silver loſt: Among the reſt there was a
prodigious lump of Gold as big as a great Loaf,
which weighed 3600 Crowns. Thus did the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of God meet with 'em for the enormous
Crimes they had committed in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſecond Kingdom is called <hi>Marien,</hi> where
there is a fine Port juſt at the end of the other
Kingdom on the North-ſide: This Kingdom is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57864:15"/>
larger than <hi>Portugal,</hi> and more fruitful, and was
ſtor'd with vaſt numbers of Inhabitants; there are
divers Mountains in it, and ſeveral Mines abounding
with Gold and Copper. The Name of the King
of this Country was <hi>Guacanagari,</hi> who had divers
Lords under his Juriſdiction. 'Twas in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
that famous Pilot who firſt diſcover'd <hi>America</hi>
landed. <hi>Guacanagari</hi> receiv'd him with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Hoſpitality and Civility; he made the beſt
Entertainment he could for all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who
accompanied him: when their Ship was ſunk, they
were receiv'd at this Prince's Court as kindly as if
they had been in the Houſes of their own natural
Relations: here they met with all manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments
and Recruits the Country afforded, which
were given 'em with great Expreſſions of Humanity
and Compaſſion on the account of their Hardſhips.
This King afterwards to ſecure himſelf from the
barbarous Uſage of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> when they began
to commit their Maſſacres in his Country, abandon'd
his Kingdom, and was forc'd to retreat into ſome
of the remote Mountains, where he died with the
Fatigues and Inconveniencies to which he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd.
Thoſe Indian Lords that depended on him
found no better Treatment, but periſh'd under that
horrible Slavery to which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had reduc'd
'em.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Maguana</hi> is the third Kingdom of this Iſland,
and is an admirable Country, both for Health and
Fruitfulneſs. Here is made the beſt Sugar in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.
Caonabo</hi> was the King of it, who ſurpaſs'd all
the other Kings both in regard of his Power, the
Riches of his Kingdom, and the Reſpect and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
with which he was honour'd. This Prince
not keeping on his Guard, nor at all diſtruſting
what Tricks the <hi>Spaniards</hi> deſign'd to play him, was
ſurpriz'd in his own Houſe by the Artifices they had
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57864:15"/>
laid to inſnare him. He was put in a Ship to be
carried into <hi>Spain,</hi> and there were at the ſame time
ſix Veſſels in the Port ready to ſet Sail, when all on
a ſudden there roſe a horrible Tempeſt, which
batter'd the Ships to pieces and ſunk 'em, with all
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that were on board. King <hi>Caonabo</hi>
loaded with Chains periſh'd, together with the
Veſſel in which he was embarqu'd. The Almighty
was pleas'd to diſplay his juſt and terrible Judgment
by this ſudden Storm, in deſtroying ſo many <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
and thereby puniſhing the Crimes they had
committed in abuſing the poor <hi>Indians.</hi> This King
had three or four Brothers, all of 'em valiant and
couragious Princes; who being much provok'd at
the unjuſt Captivity of the King, their Brother and
Soveraign, and inform'd of the Ravage and Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had made in other neighbouring
Kingdoms, and after all hearing the News of the
fatal End of their Brother, betook themſelves to
Arms, and ſought means of revenging themſelves
on their Enemies. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> attack'd 'em with
their Cavalry, which is very formidable to the
<hi>Indians,</hi> whom they ſoon conquer'd, and made ſo
prodigious a Slaughter among 'em, that half the
Kingdom was depopulated and became deſert after
this Defeat.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Xavagua</hi> is the fourth Kingdom of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> and
is as it were the Heart and Centre of all this Iſland;
the Language of it is the moſt refin'd and polite.
The People of this Kingdom are the moſt civiliz'd,
and their Manners more cultivated than thoſe of
other parts of the Country: and there are a greater
number of great Lords and Perſons of Quality
among 'em. Theſe People are better ſhap'd, and
have a finer Aſpect than thoſe of the other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.
The King's Name was <hi>Behechio,</hi> he had a
Siſter call'd <hi>Anacaona;</hi> both of 'em heap'd their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57864:16"/>
on the <hi>Spaniards</hi> when they landed in their
Country, and with a great deal of Generoſity ſav'd
'em from Death, which they could not otherwiſe
have avoided: They left no Stone unturn'd to ſhew
themſelves obliging to the Kings of <hi>Spain.</hi> After
<hi>Behechio</hi>'s Death his Siſter <hi>Anacaona</hi> continued ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Miſtreſs of the whole Kingdom. One day
the Governor of the Iſland, accompanied with 60
Horſe and 300 Foot, ſends a Summons to about 300
of the greateſt Lords of the Country to attend his
Perſon. Theſe few Horſemen alone were able to
have ravag'd and laid waſte not only all this Iſland,
but even the whole Continent, ſo defenceleſs were
theſe poor People. The Indian Nobles, not at all
ſuſpecting any treacherous Deſign, were by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor's
Order brought into a Houſe cover'd with
Straw, which he commanded to be ſet on fire,
where they periſh'd miſerably. Thoſe of 'em who
attempted to eſcape were purſued by the Spaniſh
Troopers, and kill'd without Mercy. They alſo
kill'd a vaſt multitude of the common People, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
'em and running 'em through with their Swords
and Lances. This ſame Governor caus'd Queen
<hi>Anacaona,</hi> who had the ſoveraign Authority after
the Death of her Brother (as has been ſaid) to be
hang'd, that he might diſgrace the Memory of that
Princeſs as much as he could by ſo vile and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
a Death. If at any time a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> either
touch'd with the Sentiments of Compaſſion, or
prompted with thoſe of Avarice, thought fit to
ſpare one of theſe poor Wretches for his own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
another would come tranſported with Rage,
and fall upon him in his preſence, and either run
him through the Body, or cut off his Legs, ſo as to
render him unſerviceable. Some of theſe <hi>Indians</hi>
who eſcap'd this Maſſacre retir'd into an Iſland not
above eight Leagues diſtant from this Kingdom, to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57864:16"/>
ſhelter themſelves from the Fury of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi>
but theſe were condemned by the Governor to
perpetual Slavery.</p>
                        <p>The Name of the fifth Kingdom is <hi>Hiquey: Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quanama</hi>
the Queen, who govern'd it, tho very
much advanc'd in Years and decrepit, was hang'd by
order of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who tormented an infinite
number of the Inhabitants of this Kingdom by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
kinds of cruel Puniſhments. Some they burn'd
alive, they cut off the Arms and Legs of others,
and made Slaves of the reſt. There are ſo many
things to be ſaid of the ill Treatment and Cruelty
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> exercis'd againſt the People of this
Iſland, that 'tis impoſſible to recount 'em all; and if
that could be done, the recital of 'em would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
incredible: and yet the <hi>Indians</hi> gave the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
no occaſion to engage in ſo barbarous a War
againſt 'em, and to commit ſuch Violences upon
'em; but one may truly ſay, theſe poor Creatures
liv'd in as great Subjection and Obedience to the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> as the moſt ſubmiſſive and obſequious
Order of Monks do in the moſt regular and well-diſciplin'd
Monaſtery; ſo that there was no lawful
occaſion given 'em to rob thoſe of their Property,
or condemn 'em to a rigorous Slavery, who had
found means of eſcaping their bloody Maſſacres.
'Tis further to be obſerv'd, that the <hi>Indians</hi> offer'd
no Affront to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> when they firſt arriv'd
in <hi>America:</hi> So that they had no colourable Pretext
for Revenge, or the leaſt right to puniſh 'em after ſo
cruel a manner. As for thoſe Sins, the Puniſhment
of which God has reſerv'd to himſelf, ſuch as Hatred,
Envy, the paſſionate deſire of Revenge, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
had no occaſion to reproach 'em on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
ſince theſe People have ſcarce more Strength
and Courage than Children of ten Years old. On
the other ſide, the <hi>Indians</hi> had a thouſand juſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57864:17"/>
to make War with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> tho theſe had
no reaſonable pretence to treat them as they did
with a barbarity equal to that of the moſt ſavage
and inhuman Tyrants.</p>
                        <p>After this unjuſt War was ended with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
and Maſſacre of all the Inhabitants of theſe
Countries, having reſerv'd few beſides the Women
and Children, they divided theſe among themſelves,
ſome keeping 30 of them, others 40, others 100,
ſome 200, according to the Intereſt they had in the
Tyrant of the Iſland, whom they honour'd with the
Title of Governor; for 'twas he that gave 'em
theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> on condition they would cauſe 'em to
be inſtructed in the Maxims of the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
tho the Perſons to whoſe care he committed
'em were the moſt ignorant, cruel, covetous, and
vitious of all Mankind. Theſe (as might well have
been expected) took no care to inſtruct 'em; but
confined the men to the Mines to get out Gold with
incredible Toil and Labour; they us'd the Women
for Husbandry and Tillage, tho this laſt was a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
hard enough for men of the moſt robuſt and
vigorous Conſtitution. They fed 'em only with
Herbs, or ſuch like Food, that had but little Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
or Nouriſhment in it: So that the Milk dry'd
up in the Breaſts of the Women that gave ſuck, and
their Children in a little time pin'd away and dyed
with Faintneſs and Hunger. The Men having no
Converſation with the Women, but dwelling in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
Houſes, there could be no farther propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Children by 'em. Thus at length the Men
periſh'd in the Mines with Hunger and Labour, the
Women dyed under the preſſure of their ſervitude
in the Fields; ſo that all the Inhabitants of this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
Iſland were exterminated in a ſhort time.
And indeed if the ſame courſe were taken every
where elſe, all Mankind would be deſtroy'd in the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57864:17"/>
ſpace of a few Years. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> oblig'd theſe
poor Creatures to carry Burdens of fourſcore or a
hundred pound weight for a hundred or two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Leagues. And that they might travel the
more at eaſe, they would make theſe <hi>Indians</hi> carry
them in Chairs and Horſe-litters on their Shoulders:
They us'd 'em like Beaſts of Burden to carry their
Utenſils, and what they pleas'd either for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
or Pleaſure, ſo that the Backs and Shoulders of
theſe poor Slaves were black with Bruiſes occaſion'd
by the great weight of their Burdens. Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
Fatigues did not ſecure 'em from Blows
with Cudgels and Whips, accompanied with Curſes,
nor from a great many other Puniſhments. But
'twould be endleſs to deſcribe all the Miſeries theſe
unfortunate People were made to ſuffer; it would
require whole Volumes, and the reading of ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
a Story would deeply affect and ſoften eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Mind not quite diveſted of Humanity.</p>
                        <p>It is to be obſerv'd that the Deſtruction and Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of theſe Provinces began ſince the Death of
the moſt ſerene Queen <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who departed this
Life in the Year 1504. Before this time the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
never durſt exerciſe their Cruelties on the
People of this Iſland, nor deſtroy their Country: if
they offer'd 'em any Violence, 'twas as it were by
ſtealth, and with great Precaution. But after the
Death of this Princeſs, the Deſolation became gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.
Before this fatal time, they took great care to
conceal whatever Hardſhips they made theſe People
endure, becauſe the Queen was marvellouſly zealous
both to promote the Inſtruction and Salvation of the
Inhabitants of this new World, and to advance their
Temporal Advantages; and accordingly ſhe gave us
many Examples of her Piety and Zeal.</p>
                        <p>In whatever part of <hi>America</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſet
their Feet, they perpetrated the ſame abominable
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57864:18"/>
Villanies and Maſſacres, to oppreſs and exterminate
theſe poor Innocents. They ſeem'd to take Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in the invention of new kinds of Torments,
and their Fury augmented every day more and
more, till God Almighty provok'd by ſo many hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Crimes, abandon'd 'em to a reprobate Senſe,
and permitted 'em to fall as it were from deep to
deep, and from one Precipice to another.</p>

                        <p>IN the Year 1509 the <hi>Spaniards</hi> went into the
Iſlands of <hi>St. John</hi> and <hi>Jamaica</hi> (which reſemble
delicious Gardens) with the ſame Intentions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
they had carried on in the Iſland of <hi>Hiſpaniola.</hi>
Here they committed a world of Robberies and
Cruelties, juſt as they had done in other places
where-ever they came. The Marks of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtations
and Murders were every where to be ſeen.
They laid all places deſolate where they arriv'd,
expoſing Men to the Mercy of Beaſts. And after
having inflicted all ſorts of Torments on 'em, put
'em in the Mines to work like Slaves as long as they
liv'd. They entirely depopulated theſe Countries,
ſo that in theſe two Iſlands, where there were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to have been above 600000. Inhabitants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Arrival, there are ſcarce 200 now to be
found: The reſt being all deſtroy'd with Miſery
and Hardſhip, and that without having any Pains
taken with 'em to inſtruct 'em in our Religion, or
to adminiſter the Sacraments to 'em.</p>

                        <p>THE <hi>Spaniards</hi> paſs'd into the Iſland of <hi>Cuba</hi> in
the year 1511, which contains as much ground
in length as from <hi>Vallidolid</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> There were
formerly fine and flouriſhing Provinces to be ſeen,
fill'd with vaſt numbers of People, who met with
no milder or kinder Treatment from the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
than the reſt. On the contrary, they ſeem'd to
have redoubled their Cruelty upon thoſe People.
There happen'd divers things in this Iſland that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to be remark'd. A rich and potent <hi>Cacique</hi>
nam'd <hi>Hathuey</hi> was retir'd into the Iſle of <hi>Cuba,</hi> to
avoid that Slavery and Death with which the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
menac'd him: and being inform'd that his
perſecutors were upon the point of landing in this
Iſland, he aſſembled all his Subjects and Domeſticks
together, and made a Speech to 'em after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
<hi>You know</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the Report that is ſpread
abroad, that the</hi> Spaniards <hi>are ready to invade this
Iſland; and you are not ignorant of the ill <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage our
Friends and Country-men have met with at their hands,
and the Cruelties they have committed at</hi> Hayci (ſo
<hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> is called in their Language) <hi>they are now
coming hither with a deſign to exerciſe the ſame Outrages
and Perſecutions upon us. Are you ignorant</hi> (ſays he)
<hi>of the ill Intentions of the People of whom I am ſpeaking?
We know not</hi> (ſay they all with one Voice) <hi>upon
what account they come hither, but we know they are a
very wicked and cruel People. I'll tell you then</hi> (reply'd
the <hi>Cacique) that theſe Europeans worſhip a very cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
ſort of God, ſo that 'tis difficult to ſatisfy him; and
to perform the Worſhip they render to this Idol, they'll
exact immenſe Treaſures of us, and will uſe their utmoſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57864:19"/>
Endeavour to reduce us to a miſerable ſtate of Slavery,
or elſe to put us to death.</hi> Upon which he took a Box
full of Gold and valuable Jewels which he had with
him, and expoſing it to their view: <hi>Here is</hi> (ſays
he) <hi>the God of the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>whom we muſt honour
with our Sports and Dances, to ſee if we can appeaſe
him, and render him propitious to us; that ſo he may
command the</hi> Spaniards <hi>not to offer us any Injury.</hi>
They all applauded this Speech, and fell a leaping
and dancing round the Box, till they had quite
tired and ſpent themſelves. After which the <hi>Cacique
Hathucy</hi> reſuming his Diſcourſe, continued to ſpeak
to them in theſe terms: <hi>If we keep this God</hi> (ſays he)
<hi>till he's taken away from us, he'll certainly cauſe our
Lives to be taken from us; and therefore I am of opinion
'twill be the beſt way to caſt him into the River.</hi> They
all approv'd of this Advice, and went all together
with one accord to throw this pretended God into
the River.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were no ſooner arriv'd in the Iſle
of <hi>Cuba,</hi> but this <hi>Cacyque</hi> who knew 'em too well,
began to think of retreating, to ſecure himſelf from
their Fury, and reſolv'd to defend himſelf by force
of Arms, if he ſhould happen to meet with them;
but he unfortunately fell into their Hands: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had taken all the precautions he could to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the Perſecutions of ſo cruel and impious a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and had taken Arms to defend his own Life, as
well as the Lives of his Subjects; this was made a
capital Crime in him, for which he was burn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.
While he was in the midſt of the Flames, tied
to a Stake, a certain Franciſcan Frier of great Piety
and Vertue, took upon him to ſpeak to him of God
and our Religion, and to explain to him ſome Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Catholick Faith, of which he had never
heard a word before, promiſing him Eternal Life,
if he would believe, and threatning him with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57864:19"/>
Torment, if he continued obſtinate in his Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.
<hi>Hathuey</hi> reflecting on the matter, as much
as the Place and Condition in which he was would
permit, ask'd the Frier that inſtructed him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Gate of Heaven was open to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi>
and being anſwer'd that ſuch of 'em as were good
men might hope for entrance there: The <hi>Cacyque,</hi>
without any farther deliberation, told him, he had
no mind to go to Heaven, for fear of meeting with
ſuch cruel and wicked Company as they were; but
would much rather chooſe to go to Hell, where he
might be deliver'd from the troubleſom ſight of ſuch
kind of People: To ſo great a degree have the wicked
Actions and Cruelties of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> diſhonor'd
God and his Religion in the Minds of the <hi>Americans.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>One day there came to us a great number of the
Inhabitants of a famous City, ſituate above 10
Leagues from the place where we lodg'd, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
us, and bring us all ſorts of Proviſions and
Refreſhments, which they preſented us with great
marks of Joy, careſſing us after the moſt obliging
manner they could. But that evil Spirit that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> put 'em into ſuch a ſudden Fury
againſt 'em, that they fell upon 'em and maſſacred
above 3000 of 'em, both Men and Women, upon
the ſpot, without having receiv'd the leaſt Offence
or Provocation from 'em. I was an Eye-witneſs of
this Barbarity; and whatever endeavours were
us'd to appeaſe theſe inhuman Creatures, 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to reduce 'em to Reaſon; ſo reſolutely
were they bent to ſatiate their brutal Rage by this
barbarous Action.</p>
                        <p>Soon after this I ſent Meſſengers to the moſt noted
<hi>Indians</hi> of the Province of <hi>Havane,</hi> to encourage
and engage 'em to continue in their Country, and
not to trouble themſelves to ſeek remote places to
hide in, and advis'd 'em to come to us with aſſurance
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57864:20"/>
of our Protection. They knew well enough what
Authority I had over the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and I gave 'em
my word, no Injury ſhould be offer'd 'em: for the
paſt Cruelties and Maſſacres their Country-men had
ſuffer'd, had ſpread Fear and Terror through all the
Country; and this Aſſurance I gave 'em was with
the Conſent and Advice of the Captains and other
Officers. When we enter'd into this Province, two
and twenty of their Chiefs came to us, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
next Morning the Commander of our Troops,
without any regard to the Promiſe that had been
made 'em, would needs ſentence 'em to be burnt,
pretending 'twas beſt to put theſe People to death,
becauſe they might one time or other uſe ſome Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem
to ſurprize and deſtroy us: And I had all
the difficulty in the world to prevent 'em from
throwing 'em into the Fire.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Havane</hi> ſeeing themſelves reduc'd
to a ſtate of ſevere Slavery, and that there was no
Remedy left, but they were irrecoverably undone,
began to ſeek Refuge in the Deſerts and Mountains,
to ſecure themſelves if poſſible from Death: Some
ſtrangled themſelves in deſpair; Parents hang'd
themſelves, together with their Children, to put the
ſpeedier end to their Miſeries by Death. Above
two hundred <hi>Indians</hi> periſh'd here after this manner,
to avoid the Cruelty of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of them afterwards voluntarily condemn'd
themſelves to this kind of Death, hoping thus in a
moment to put a period to the Miſeries their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors
inflicted on 'em.</p>
                        <p>A certain <hi>Spaniard</hi> who had the Title of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
in this Iſland, and had three hundred <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
in his Service, deſtroy'd a hundred and ſixty
of 'em in leſs than three Months, by the exceſſive
Labour he continually exacted of 'em. The Recruits
he took to fill up their places were deſtroy'd after
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57864:20"/>
the ſame manner; and he would in a ſhort time have
unpeopled the whole Iſland, if Death, which took
him out of the way very happily for thoſe poor
Wretches, had not ſhelter'd 'em from his Cruelties.
I ſaw with with my own Eyes above ſix thouſand
Children die in the ſpace of three or four Months,
their Parents being forc'd to abandon 'em, being
condemn'd to the Mines. After this the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
took up a Reſolution to purſue thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> that
were retir'd into the Mountains, and maſſacred mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of 'em; ſo that this Iſland was depopulated
and laid waſte in a very little time. And 'tis a moſt
lamentable Spectacle to ſee ſo fine a Country thus
miſerably ruin'd and unpeopled.</p>

                        <head>Of the Continent.</head>
                        <p>IN the Year 1514, a mercileſs Governor, deſtitute
of the leaſt ſentiment of Pity or Humanity, who
was deſervedly accounted a barbarous Tyrant, and
cruel Inſtrument of the Wrath of God, pierc'd into
the Continent, being follow'd by a great many
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> all animated with the Spirit, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
the Deſigns of their Leader. Tho ſome of
his ſtamp had enter'd the Continent before him,
and had kill'd a great many People, yet they had
only exercis'd their Robberies and Cruelties on the
Sea-Coaſts. But he of whom I am now ſpeaking,
ſurpaſs'd all his Predeceſſors in Cruelty and Impiety.
He was not content to ravage the Sea-Coaſts, but
laid waſte great Kingdoms and vaſt Countries, and
deſtroy'd an infinite number of <hi>Indians</hi> in the groſs
Darkneſs of their Idolatry. He run through above
fifty Leagues of the fineſt Country in the World,
and carried Deſolation with him where-ever he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57864:21"/>
went, ruining in a little time the moſt pleaſant and
fruitful Country in the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> There were
before the Arrival of this Tyrant, abundance of
Villages, Towns and Cities, that excell'd thoſe of
all the neighbouring Countries. This Country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
more in Gold than any yet diſcover'd. The
immenſe Riches that have fill'd <hi>Spain</hi> ſince ſhe has
traded to the <hi>Indies,</hi> have been chiefly drawn out
of the Mines of the Country of which I am now
ſpeaking.</p>
                        <p>The Governor of this new World invented va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
kinds of Torments to conſtrain the Inhabitants
to give him all the Gold they had heap'd together.
In one Progreſs which ſome of his Captains made by
his Order to pillage and rob the People of their
Riches, they put above forty thouſand of 'em to
the Sword; others they burnt, others they expos'd
to be devour'd by Dogs, and the reſt they deſtroy'd
with divers other kinds of cruel Puniſhments.</p>
                        <p>The wretched Ignorance of thoſe that have been
ſent to govern the <hi>Indies,</hi> has occaſion'd a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Miſchiefs and Diſorders, and hinder'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of the <hi>Indians:</hi> for what they endeavour'd
to perſwade 'em by their Words, was contradicted
by their Actions; and the Sentiments of their
Minds were no ways conformable to the Pretenſions
of their Tongues. They commanded the <hi>Indians</hi>
to embrace the Chriſtian Religion upon pain of
Death, they menac'd 'em with cruel Slavery, or the
moſt exquiſite Tortures, to force 'em to turn Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
or to ſwear Allegiance to the King of <hi>Spain:</hi>
As if the Son of God, who dy'd for the Redemption
of Men, had ordain'd thoſe whom he ſent to preach
the Goſpel, and to declare the Kingdom of God,
to conſtrain People that liv'd peaceably in their
own Country, to make profeſſion of his Doctrine,
on pain of being plunder'd of their Goods, of being
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57864:21"/>
ſeparated from their Wives and Children, of loſing
their Liberty, and of being condemn'd to a cruel
Death, without having ever been inſtructed in the
Maxims and Principles of our Religion. And the
poor Creatures muſt be oblig'd to render an exact
Obedience to a King they had never ſeen or heard
of, till they were inform'd of him by theſe Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of his that treated 'em ſo inhumanly.</p>
                        <p>This bloody and impious Governor, urg'd with
the inſatiable deſire of heaping up Treaſure, pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the <hi>Indians</hi> that dwelt both in the Villages and
Cities with Impunity, while they little thought of
ſecuring themſelves againſt his Robberies. He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
his Souldiers to go privately to the places
where they ſuſpected any Gold was to be found,
and to declare his Orders to the Inhabitants of this
new World after the following manner. <q>
                              <hi>Caciques</hi>
and <hi>Indians</hi> of this Continent, we are come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to you that there is but one God, one Pope,
and one King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who is Lord and Maſter of
the Country you inhabit; we therefore require
you to come immediately and take the Oath of
Allegiance to him.</q> After ſuch kind of Preambles
as theſe, they would chooſe the Night to fall ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
upon theſe poor Wretches, when laid faſt
aſleep, without having taken any meaſures to ſecure
themſelves from the Artifices of their Enemies,
who would ſet fire to their Houſes, which being
thatch'd with Reeds and Straw, were burnt to Aſhes
in an inſtant. The Women and Children were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
by the Flames almoſt before they had time to
conſider where they were. They maſſacred ſuch
as made a ſhift to eſcape the Fire, or kept 'em for
Slaves; they uſed Tortures to force 'em to tell
where they had hid their Gold. They printed
Marks on their Bodies with red hot Branding-irons;
and after all theſe Cruelties, us'd their utmoſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57864:22"/>
to make a ſtrict ſearch for the Gold of theſe
miſerable People, of which they got vaſt Quantities
together, beſides Pearls and Diamonds, which the
<hi>Indians</hi> gave 'em to avoid their Fury. All the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
who had any Office or Place of Truſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the ſame Rapine; every one ſent as many
Souldiers as he could to make their Progreſſes, and
ravage all the Country. The firſt Biſhop that was
ſent into <hi>America,</hi> imitated the Conduct of theſe
covetous Governors, and made uſe of his Servants
to procure himſelf a ſhare of the Spoil. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
in a little time carried away above three
Millions out of this Kingdom; of which vaſt Sum
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had ſcarce 3000 Crowns for his
ſhare. Here were above 800000 People ſlaughter'd;
and the ſucceeding Governors continued the like
Maſſacres till they had deſtroy'd the reſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
                        <p>I muſt not paſs over in ſilence one Action com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in this Country by the Governor, of whom
I have been ſpeaking. A <hi>Cacique,</hi> whether volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
or out of fear I know not, gave him the weight
of 9000 Crowns in Gold: This great Sum not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they tied this unhappy Prince
to a Stake, and ſetting fire to his Feet, endeavour'd
by this means to extort a greater quantity from him.
This Torment being intolerable to him, he gave
'em the weight of 3000 Crowns of Gold more,
which he had reſerv'd; upon this they renew'd their
Tortures, to get ſtill more out of him: but whether
he had no more to give 'em, or whether he was
reſolv'd they ſhould exact no more of him, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd
amidſt their Tortures. They put to death
many of the moſt conſiderable Perſons of this
Kingdom after the ſame cruel manner.</p>
                        <p>A Company of <hi>Spaniards</hi> happening to light on a
Body of <hi>Indians</hi> that had retreated into the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57864:22"/>
to avoid the Tyranny of their Perſecutors,
in a great rage fell upon the poor Wretches, and
killing all the Men they could catch, carried away
three or fourſcore Women Priſoners. The <hi>Indians</hi>
that eſcap'd being highly incens'd, came in Arms to
attack the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to try if they could oblige
'em to let go their Prey: Theſe ſeeing the <hi>Indians</hi>
draw near 'em, and being unwilling to ſurrender
the Booty they had taken, ſtab'd the Women and
Maids in the preſence of their Husbands and Fathers,
who were ſeiz'd with Horror and Deſpair at the
ſight of ſo lamentable a Tragedy; and ſmiting their
Breaſts, cry'd out, <hi>O mercileſs Men! O cruel Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards!
who can murder poor Women that never offended
you without Pity!</hi> And indeed they muſt be more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
and bloody than Beaſts of Prey, who can be
capable of ſuch brutiſh Actions as theſe.</p>
                        <p>One of the greateſt Lords of this Country,
whoſe Name was <hi>Paris,</hi> had a Houſe about ten or
fifteen Leagues diſtance from <hi>Panama;</hi> he was very
rich, having a great quantity of Gold in his poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
When the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came to his Houſe, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
'em with as much Kindneſs and Civility as if
they had been his Relations. He frankly gave the
Captain the value of 15000 Crowns: This Captain,
and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that accompanied him, concluded
that this Indian muſt needs have immenſe Treaſures,
from the parcel of Gold he had given 'em; and
ſince they had undertaken this Journey on purpoſe
to rob him, to make the more ſure of ſucceeding in
their Deſign, they pretended they would be gone,
and accordingly took their leave of him, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
in the middle of the Night, and ruſhing into
the City unexpectedly, they ſet it on fire, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
abundance of the Citizens in the Flames,
and carried away thence 50 or 60000 Crowns. A
Perſon of the moſt conſiderable Quality of any in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57864:23"/>
this City eſcap'd the fury of this Fire; and after a
Reſpite of three or four days, having got as many
Men together as he could, fell upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by
ſurprize, kill'd about fifty of 'em, and retook all
the Spoil of the City which they had burnt, and
particularly the Value of 40000 Crowns, of which
they had plunder'd him: the reſt of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
made the beſt of their way and eſcap'd, but not
without a great many Wounds. Soon after this
they return'd with a greater Force to attack this
<hi>Cacique,</hi> and deſtroy'd the greateſt part of his
Troops, making Slaves of the reſt.</p>

                        <p>IN the Year 1522, the forementioned Governor
undertook to ſubdue the Province of <hi>Nicaraqua.</hi>
The great Fertility of this Country, the Goodneſs of
the Air, and the vaſt number of the Inhabitants
cannot be ſufficiently expreſs'd. There were Cities
in this Province four Leagues in length. The great
quantities of excellent Fruits that grow there, drew
together thoſe great multitudes of People. Theſe
Cities being ſituate in vaſt Plains, the People had
no Mountains near in which to hide themſelves;
beſides, the Climat is ſo ſweet, and the Country ſo
agreeable, that the Inhabitants could not eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to quit it, and conſequently were the more
expos'd to the Outrages and Perſecutions of the
<hi>Spaniards;</hi> yet they ſuffer'd all with as much pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
as was poſſible, that they might not be oblig'd
to change their Dwelling. And tho theſe People
are naturally of a mild and peaceable Temper, the
Governor, or rather the Tyrant, with the Miniſters
of his Cruelty, reſolv'd to treat the <hi>Indians</hi> of this
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57864:23"/>
Province after the ſame manner he had done thoſe
of other Kingdoms. Here he committed ſo many
Enormities, ſuch Robberies and Maſſacres, that 'tis
impoſſible for any Pen to relate 'em all. He ſent
50 Troopers into this Province, which is bigger than
the Country of <hi>Rouſillon,</hi> who maſſacred almoſt all
the Inhabitants, without any regard to Age, Sex or
Quality. If theſe poor Creatures fail'd to bring
'em a certain meaſure of Corn which they exacted
of 'em, or did not ſend into their Service ſuch a
number of Slaves as they demanded, they kill'd 'em
without Mercy. And this being a plain Country
(as has been ſaid) there was no place to ſhelter 'em
from the Spaniſh Horſe, who purſu'd 'em with the
utmoſt Fury.</p>
                        <p>The General permitted theſe Villains to commit
all the Inſolencies and Robberies they pleas'd, and
to take as great a number of Priſoners as they deſir'd.
Theſe they ſometimes loaded with Chains of ſixty
or eighty Pound weight; ſo that of 4000 Captives,
ſcarce ſix were able to endure this Fatigue, the reſt
all dy'd by the way under the intolerable weight of
their Fetters. That they might not have the trouble
to open the Chains of ſuch as dy'd with Hunger,
Thirſt, Wearineſs and Toil, they cut off their
Heads. When the <hi>Indians</hi> ſaw the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

were never likely to ſee their Friends and Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

                        </p>
                        <p>One day a Fancy came into the Governors Head,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57864:24"/>
to make a new diſtribution of the <hi>Indians;</hi> he took
'em away from thoſe for whom he had no kindneſs,
and gave a greater number to thoſe he reſpected.
This chopping and changing of Slaves occaſion'd a
great ſcarcity for one Year, there being but a very
ſmall Crop on the ground. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to ſupply this defect by taking from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
all the Corn and other Proviſions which they
had laid up in ſtore for the Subſiſtence of their
Families. This Diſorder produc'd a Famin among
'em, which deſtroy'd above thirty thouſand People.
There was one Woman ſo intolerably preſs'd with
Hunger, that ſhe kill'd her Child to appeaſe her
Appetite.</p>
                        <p>All the Cities and Fields round 'em are like plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Gardens, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> cultivated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ſhare each one had aſſign'd him by
Lot: and to ſave their own Revenues, they fed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Stores that belong'd to the <hi>Indians,</hi> and liv'd
at their Charge, devouring in a few days what theſe
poor People had been a long time getting together
with a great deal of Care and Toil. There was
no <hi>Spaniard</hi> but had an Eſtate of his own, and kept
abundance of <hi>Indians</hi> in his Houſe to manure his
Land, and to do other Domeſtick Buſineſs: and none
of theſe were exempted from Slavery, their Nobles,
their Women and Children were made to work day
and night for the advantage of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who
exacted Tasks of 'em quite beyond their Strength,
and miſerably wore 'em out with exceſs of Labour
and Hardſhip. They drove 'em out of their Houſes,
and took poſſeſſion of 'em; they ſeiz'd their Goods
and Lands, and inſtantly conſum'd their Proviſions,
thus reducing 'em to extreme neceſſity. Many of 'em
dy'd under the heavy Burdens they oblig'd 'em to
carry on their Shoulders as far as the Port, which was
above 30 Leagues; for hither they made 'em bring
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57864:24"/>
Planks and pieces of Timber for the building of
Veſſels. They forc'd 'em to go and ſeek for Honey
and Wax in the Mountains, where they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
by Tygers: Women big with Child were
not exempted from theſe hard Services, and often
periſh'd together with their Fruit, under the preſſure
of this rigorous Slavery.</p>
                        <p>That which contributed yet farther to unpeople
this Province, was the liberty the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took to
exact of the <hi>Caciques,</hi> and richeſt <hi>Indians,</hi> a great
number of Slaves. This kind of Tribute was au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd
by the Governor, and levied with a great
deal of Severity; for he threaten'd to burn 'em alive
if they fail'd to ſend him a Recruit of fifty Slaves
every three Months, or as often as he ſhould give
order: tho the <hi>Indians</hi> have no great number of
Slaves ordinarily, and 'tis much if a <hi>Cacique</hi> has three
or four among his other Domeſticks. If a Father
had two Children, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would take away
one of them, or two if he had three: The Parents
muſt ſubmit, with how great Reluctancy ſoever; but
their Children were not raviſh'd from 'em without
abundance of Tears and dolorous Complaints; for
they have a very tender Affection to their Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring,
and breed 'em up with abundance of Care.
This kind of Tribute being often extorted, all this
Kingdom was in a few years depopulated. There
arriv'd five or ſix Ships here every year, which were
laden with Slaves, whom they tranſported into
<hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Panama,</hi> and there ſold 'em, where they
died in a little time; for it has been confirm'd by
many Experiments, that thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> that are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
from their Native Country into other Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mats,
ſeldom live long: And that which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to kill 'em the ſooner, was the neglect of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
'em with ſufficient Suſtenance, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
Labour with which they were over-charg'd.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57864:25"/>
In the ſpace of a few Years there were above
500000 Slaves drawn out of this Province, tho they
were all burn free: and during the War that was
made againſt 'em, there dy'd about fifty or ſixty
thouſand beſides theſe: the reſt were condemn'd to
cruel Slavery, in which a conſiderable number dy'd
every day. There are about four or five thouſand
People ſtill to be found in this Province; but it was
once one of the beſt peopled Countries in all <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica:</hi>
And in a little time in all appearance the reſt
will be deſtroy'd by the ill Treatment they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
ſuffer.</p>

it, and to maſſacre the Inhabitants, tho they
pretend to go out of <hi>Europe</hi> to people this Country.
Their Violences and Oppreſſions arriv'd to ſuch a
height, that they had no regard either to God or
the King, but forgot both that they were Men and
Chriſtians. Since they came into this Country, there
has been nothing but Rapine and Spoil, Maſſacres,
and buring of Cities, nothing but Tyranny and
Violence; ſo that they have in a ſhort time depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated
and ruined vaſt Kingdoms from one end to
t'other. The remembrance of the Villanies and
Cruelties committed there, has caſt ſuch a Terror
into the minds of the Natives, that they can't think
of a <hi>Spaniard</hi> without trembling. They have not
yet left off tormenting 'em; on the contrary
they rather grow worſe and worſe, and their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions

This Country contains four or five Kingdoms, that

Fertility, and Plenty of all things: Here were
Cities to be ſeen more populous than <hi>Toledo, Seville,

violent Deaths, both Men, Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,

                        <p>IN the flouriſhing and famous City of <hi>Cholula,</hi>
which contain'd more than thirty thouſand Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
the principal Inhabitants, together with the
Prieſts, led by him whom they look'd upon as their
High-prieſt, came with abundance of Solemnity and
Pomp to meet the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and that they might
receive 'em with the greater Honour and Reſpect,
they had order'd matters ſo amongſt themſelves,
that thoſe of the higheſt quality in the City ſhould
conduct the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to their Houſes, and give 'em
the beſt Entertainment they could. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> reſolv'd upon the ſpot to
make a horrible ſlaughter of 'em, thereby to render
themſelves the more formidable, and to ſpread Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
through all the Country. And this method they
us'd to obſerve in every Country through which
they paſs'd, <hi>viz.</hi> to make a great Maſſacre at their
firſt Arrival, that the People, who are as meek as
Sheep, might not look upon 'em without dread.
They deputed ſome to go and treat with the chief
Men of the City, and places adjacent, to engage
'em to come and meet 'em, that they might confer
together. Theſe were no ſooner come to 'em, but
they put 'em in Chains, while the Inhabitants of
the City knew nothing of this Treachery. They
demanded 6000 <hi>Indians</hi> of 'em to carry their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
their Utenſils and Proviſions: When they
were come, they ſhut 'em up in divers Yards, and
'twas a miſerable Spectacle to ſee the poor Wretches
prepare to carry the Burdens they were to lay upon
'em. They were almoſt ſtark naked, and ſtoop'd
down proſtrating themſelves upon the Ground, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57864:26"/>
like Sheep to the Blows and Wounds theſe
Tyrants gave 'em. When they were all thus pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ſeveral Courts or Yards, part of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
arm'd with Lances and Pikes fill'd up the Avenues
to hinder the <hi>Indians</hi> from eſcaping, while the reſt
put 'em to the Sword; ſo that none of theſe eſcap'd.
Two or three days after they found ſome of them
among the Carcaſes all cover'd with Wounds and
Blood, that had been left for dead; theſe cry'd for
Mercy, and beg'd they might be ſuffer'd to live;
but theſe bloody Men were not at all ſoften'd by
their Groans and Tears, and the ſubmiſſive manner
in which they ask'd their Lives, but cut 'em in pieces
upon the ſpot with a kind of nameleſs Cruelty.
Above a hundred of the principal <hi>Indians</hi> of this
place were put in Irons, and kept alive as yet:
But the Commander of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> order'd Stakes
to be fix'd in the Ground, and theſe unhappy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to be faſten'd to 'em and burnt. The King of
the Country happen'd to make his Eſcape, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
into a Temple with thirty or forty attending
him, hoping to find Sanctuary there: Here he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
himſelf for a whole day. But the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
who never gave Quarter to any one whom they
found in Arms, ſet fire to the Temple, and burnt
all that were in it. They cry'd out of the midſt
of the Flames: <hi>O vile and cruel Men! what hurt have
we done you, that you ſhould kill us after this manner?
Be gone, be gone to</hi> Mexico, <hi>where our King</hi> Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çuma
<hi>will puniſh you according to your deſerts.</hi> 'Tis
ſaid the Spaniſh Commander was at play during this
Tragedy; and that when the Flames had quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
theſe poor <hi>Indians,</hi> in a Tranſport of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Joy, ſhall I ſay? or Fury, he utter'd theſe words:
<hi>Nero,</hi> ſays he, <hi>beholding from Mount</hi> Tarpeius <hi>the
Flames that laid</hi> Rome <hi>in Aſhes,</hi> heard the Cries of his
Citizens without any Emotion of Compaſſion.</p>

                           <pb n="36" facs="tcp:57864:27"/>
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> made another great Maſſacre in
the City of <hi>Tepeaca,</hi> which is a yet finer and larger
City than the former, and comprehends in it a
greater number of Houſes. Here they kill'd a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of the Inhabitants with their Lances and
Swords. They afterwards went to <hi>Mexico,</hi> where
King <hi>Monteçuma</hi> accompanied with his Nobles, and
thoſe of the moſt diſtinguiſhed Rank in his Court,
entertain'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with all ſorts of Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to teſtify how mightily they were pleas'd
with their Arrival. The King's Brother came to
meet 'em with a ſplendid Retinue; he made 'em
noble Preſents in Gold and Silver, and gave 'em
rich Stuffs painted with divers Colours: the King
himſelf receiv'd 'em at the entrance of the City with
all his Court, being carried upon a Golden Frame, or
Chair of State, and conducted 'em to the Palace
that was provided for 'em. But the ſame day they
ſeiz'd this unfortunate Prince, who thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
leſs, and poſted fourſcore Souldiers to guard
him, having loaded him with a heavy Chain. This
Action put all the <hi>Indians</hi> in a Conſternation and
Fear. But to augment their Terror, they contriv'd
to ſignalize their Cruelty by ſome memorable Action.
All the Nobility of the City was engag'd in repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
Plays and Shows, and in dancing round the
place where their King was impriſon'd, to allay the
Troubles of his Mind during his Captivity; in theſe
Plays they expos'd to view all their Riches and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence.
Theſe were the Demonſtrations of their
Joy, and of the deſire they had to pleaſe the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi>
The Nobles and Princes of the Blood, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their ſeveral degrees, were employ'd in
theſe Plays and Dances (as I have ſaid) round about
their Prince's Priſon; ſo that there were about the
Palace two thouſands young Men that were the very
flower of the whole Kingdom, and the Pride and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57864:27"/>
Glory of the Court of King <hi>Monteçuma:</hi> While
they were thus engag'd, the Commander of the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> with one of his Troops came to fall upon
'em. He had ſent the reſt of his Souldiers into the
other quarters of the City, where the People were
uſing the like Divertiſements, ordering 'em to ſeem
to join in with theſe Indian Sports, as if they were
mightily pleas'd with 'em, but withal giving 'em a
word to put theſe Dancers at a certain time to the
Sword. Accordingly they fell upon 'em, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
the word <hi>St. James,</hi> which was the Signal
for maſſacring theſe poor naked <hi>Indians,</hi> that were
in no condition to defend themſelves from Souldiers
arm'd with Swords and Lances: with theſe they
made large Wounds in the tender Bodies of the
young Noblemen of <hi>Mexico,</hi> who were all maſſacred,
and not ſo much as one of 'em eſcap'd. The <hi>Indians</hi>
in the other parts of the City were ſeiz'd with ſo
much Horror and Trouble, that they knew not
where to ſeek for ſhelter to ſecure themſelves from
the fury of theſe Cut-throats, whom they loaded
with a thouſand Curſes. Since this time they don't
forget to celebrate the memory of this barbarous
Action with their Sighs and Tears, and have put
this day in the Rank of their moſt unfortunate ones,
ſince in it they loſt in a moment the moſt illuſtrious
Nobility of the whole Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> who had ſuffer'd the Impriſonment of
their King with ſo much patience, hearing of the
Maſſacre of ſo many young Noblemen, could not
but expreſs their Deteſtation of this ſo bloody and
wicked a Fact, and took up Arms to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
and tho <hi>Monteçuma</hi> had forbidden 'em to
offer the <hi>Spaniards</hi> any Violence, they attack'd 'em
vigorouſly, and kill'd divers of 'em, and the reſt were
conſtrained to retreat. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> put a Dagger
to their Prince's Breaſt, and ſhew'd him in this
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57864:28"/>
poſture to his Subjects through a Window, hoping
the ſight of it would oblige 'em to lay down their
Arms, which the Prince himſelf likewiſe command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to do; but they were too much provok'd
now to obey even his Orders. They choſe one to
head 'em, and having put all their Troops under
his Command, attack'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſo furiouſly,
and fought with ſo much obſtinacy, that theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
they were not able to withſtand 'em, left
the City, and retreated in the middle of the night;
which the <hi>Indians</hi> perceiving, purſu'd 'em, and kill'd
a great number of 'em as they paſs'd the Rivers.
However the <hi>Spaniards</hi> return'd ſoon after with a
greater Strength, and aſſaulted and took the City,
in which they made a horrible ſlaughter, and burnt
thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> that were of greateſt Note.</p>
                        <p>After they had committed all this Cruelty and
Spoil in the City of <hi>Mexico,</hi> they carried Deſolation
with them into the Province of <hi>Panuco,</hi> which is
not above twenty Leagues diſtant from it, and here
exerciſed their ordinary Barbarity. This Province
was mightily ſtock'd with People: but ſince the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the greateſt part of 'em has
been cut off. The Province of <hi>Tute-peca,</hi> and that
of <hi>Colima</hi> underwent the ſame Fate; each of which
Provinces is as big as the Kingdoms of <hi>Leon</hi> and
<hi>Caſtile.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Tis to be obſerv'd that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> invaded
theſe Provinces only to plunder and inſlave the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.
One of the firſt things they did was to
oblige 'em to take the Oath of Allegiance to the
King of <hi>Spain;</hi> which if they refus'd to do, they
were preſently maſſacred, or made Slaves. They
declar'd thoſe of 'em Rebels who came not to meet
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to ſubmit to their unjuſt and cruel
Orders. Thoſe of the higheſt rank among the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
were accus'd of this Crime, and this was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57864:28"/>
againſt 'em to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> without
conſidering that 'tis a plain Rule in Law, that none
can be term'd Rebels but Subjects that are revolted
from their Prince.</p>
                        <p>There's no good Chriſtian will make any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
to conclude, that ſuch Miſſionaries as the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> have not the Qualifications neceſſary to
inſinuate the Maxims of our Religion into theſe
People, who are naturally free, and know not how
to bear the Haughtineſs and Inſolence with which
they have been treated: for they are peremptorily
told, you muſt without any more ado ſubmit to the
Obedience of a Foreign Prince, whom you never
ſaw nor heard of; and if you refuſe ſo to do, we'll
cut you in pieces; and this no ſooner ſaid but done.
But that which is more unaccountable is, that thoſe
who yield a blind Obedience to all they command
'em, are no better treated than the others; for they
are made miſerable Slaves, they exact intolerable
Tasks of 'em, and condemn 'em to all ſorts of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
So that whole Provinces, both Men, Women
and Children, are deſtroy'd in a ſhort time: Nay,
thoſe whom they kill outright are the happier ſort,
as having an end put to their Miſeries in a moment.
But when they are forc'd by Menaces to promiſe
Fidelity and Obedience to a Foreign Prince, can it
be pretended they are oblig'd to it in Conſcience,
when this ſuppos'd Duty is neither founded on the
Laws of God, nor thoſe of Nations? Beſides, the
Threatnings that are made 'em are capable of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
Men of the greateſt Courage and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
wherefore all the Promiſes obtain'd by ſuch
menaces have no value nor obliging force. I paſs
over in ſilence the Affronts, the Inſults and Injuries
that were offer'd the King of <hi>Mexico.</hi> In a word,
they have violated all the Laws of Nations, and
infinitely wrong'd and abus'd the poor <hi>Indians.</hi> This
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57864:29"/>
is all the Service the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have done theſe
People.</p>
                        <p>The Governor of this new World, ſupported by
his imaginary Titles, ſent two Captains, ſcarce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to himſelf in Impiety aad Cruelty, into the
Kingdoms of <hi>Guatimala,</hi> which are ſituate towards
the South: they pierc'd as far as the Kingdoms of
<hi>Naco</hi> and <hi>Gaymura,</hi> which extend Northward for
the ſpace of about 300 Leagues; theſe Kingdoms
border upon that of <hi>Mexico.</hi> Theſe Captains tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
both by Sea and Land, accompanied with a
good party of Horſe, and a conſiderable number of
Foot.</p>
                        <p>The Captain whoſe Lot it was to travel into <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timala,</hi>
did a world of miſchief there (the other
ſoon dying) he carried Deſolation with him every
where, and fill'd this Kingdom with Blood and Ruin,
to render the <hi>Spaniards</hi> formidable even to future
Generations. I am of opinion, that the miſchief this
Captain did here ſurpaſs'd whatever the <hi>Europeans</hi>
had done before in the new World. He went by
Sea, and carried Sword and Fire throughout all the
Coaſts. Some of the Inhabitants of the Kingdom
of <hi>Yucatan,</hi> which is in the way to the Kingdoms of
<hi>Naco</hi> and <hi>Gaymura,</hi> made him magnificent Preſents:
yet as ſoon as he had enter'd their Country, he ſent
his Souldiers into every part of it, who committed
horrible Spoil, and maſſacred an infinite number of
theſe poor People. A furious <hi>Spaniard</hi> at the head
of 300 Men, enter'd the Country adjoining to <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timala,</hi>
ſet fire to all their Cities, and cut the throats
of all the Inhabitants, without giving any quarter:
he carried away what Booty he could, and continued
to pillage the Country for the ſpace of ſixſcore
Leagues. This Captain had rebell'd, and revolted
againſt his General; and his deſign in ruining the
Country after this manner was to put the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
                           <pb n="41" facs="tcp:57864:29"/>
out of a condition to purſue him, by preventing
their finding Subſiſtence in a Country thus ruin'd,
and by expoſing 'em to the fury of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who
would omit nothing to revenge upon 'em the Injuries
and Miſchiefs they had receiv'd from their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
which fell out accordingly: For the Spaniſh
General attempting to purſue this Rebel, was kill'd
by the <hi>Indians.</hi> Thoſe that ſucceeded him exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
all manner of Cruelties on 'em, and reduc'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all of 'em to Slavery, after they had ſpoil'd 'em
of all their Goods, Proviſions, Clothes, Corn, Wine
and other neceſſaries of Life. The Provinces of
<hi>Naco</hi> and <hi>Hondure,</hi> which were like Gardens of
Pleaſure, were turn'd into melancholy Deſerts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho
this Country was very full of People. 'Tis
impoſſible to reflect on theſe things without being
ſenſibly touch'd and ſoften'd into Compaſſion, tho
one were naturally of an obdurate and ſowr Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
They kill'd two Millions of People in this
Country in leſs than ten years; ſo that there are
ſcarce two thouſand left in all the vaſt Extent of it;
and theſe are groaning under a heavy yoke of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.
When they propos'd to 'em to take the Oath
of Allegiance to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> they would
give 'em no time to deliberate; they muſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
obey, or elſe die by Fire or Sword.</p>

Kingdom by divers Maſſacres, tho the King
came to meet 'em in his Chair of State ſupported
by his Slaves, follow'd by a great number of his Lords,
and with Trumpets and Drums before him, to give
the greater Teſtimony of Joy; he ſhew'd 'em all
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57864:30"/>
the Courteſy and Civility in the world, manifeſted
a great deal of Kindneſs in readily ſupplying 'em
with plenty of Proviſions, and gave 'em whatever
they could reaſonably deſire. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> lodg'd
without the City the firſt night, thinking they ſhould
not be ſecure enough in a place ſo well fortified.
The next day they engag'd the Prince of the place
to come out to 'em with the greateſt part of the
Perſons of Quality, obliging to bring with them a
certain quantity of Gold. The <hi>Indians</hi> made anſwer
that 'twas impoſſible for them to do what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
becauſe their Country did not yield this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.
However this refuſal ſo mov'd the Indignation
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that for no other Offence, without
any formal Proceſs, they caſt 'em all alive into a
great Fire. The moſt conſiderable Inhabitants of
theſe Provinces, ſeeing their Maſters ſo cruelly
treated, only becauſe they gave not the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
all the Gold they demanded, retir'd with all ſpeed
into the Mountains, ordering the common People
to ſubmit to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as their Maſters, and
giving 'em a ſtrict charge by no means to give the
leaſt notice of the places where they were gone to
hide themſelves. Abundance of theſe poor People
came accordingly to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> begging of 'em
to receive them into the number of their Servants,
and promiſing to ſerve 'em faithfully as far as they
were capable. The Spaniſh Commander roughly
anſwer'd 'em, that he would not ſo receive 'em, but
cut 'em to pieces without Mercy, unleſs they would
diſcover the places whither their Maſters were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated;
the <hi>Indians</hi> replied, they did not know:
however they readily offer'd themſelves, their
Wives and Children to their Service; and ſaid, they
would continue in their Houſes expecting their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
they further told 'em, they might treat 'em
as they pleas'd, 'twas in their power either to kill
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57864:30"/>
'em, or to ſave 'em alive to employ 'em in their
ſervice. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon this went into their
Villages and Towns, and found theſe poor <hi>Indians</hi>
with their Wives and Children buſy at their Work,
and in great ſecurity, believing they had no need to
fear the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would attack 'em; yet theſe blood-thirſty
Men maſſacred 'em without pity. After
this they went to another great Town, the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of which confiding in their Innocence, thought
themſelves in no great danger; but this whole Town
was deſtroy'd in leſs than two hours, and the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre
was ſo general, that no Age, nor Sex, nor
Quality met with Pity, but all were put to the
Sword, unleſs ſuch as fled before the arrival of the
<hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> at length finding it impoſſible either
by their Patience, their Submiſſions, or their Preſents
to ſoften the cruel and ſavage Temper of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
who cut their Throats without any reaſon,
or any ſentiment of Pity, reſolv'd to get together
in a body, and take Arms to defend themſelves: for
ſeeing Death was inevitable to 'em, and become a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Evil, they choſe rather to die with Weapons
in their hands, thereby to ſell their Lives at as dear
a rate as they could, and to revenge themſelves as
much as poſſible on their Perſecutors, than to ſuffer
their Throats to be cut like Sheep without making
any reſiſtance. They wanted effectual Arms, they
were quite naked, and knew their Strength was
much inferior to that of their Enemies; they had
no Horſes, nor did they underſtand the uſe of 'em
in Battel: they had to do with a furious and warlike
Enemy that gave 'em no quarter, and deſign'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but their Extirpation. They therefore thought
it neceſſary to uſe Stratagems: it came into their
heads to make Pits up and down the ways by which
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were to paſs, and to cover 'em with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57864:31"/>
Straw and Leaves that they might not be perceiv'd,
that ſo their Horſes might fall in 'em, and break their
Necks or Legs. Some of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were two or
three times taken in theſe Traps, but afterwards
took care to avoid 'em, and reſolv'd to caſt all the
<hi>Indians</hi> they could take into theſe Pits, whether
Men, Women or Children, of what Age or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
ſoever; they threw in Women big with
Child, and old Men as well as others, till they had
quite fill'd 'em. It was a moſt lamentable ſight to
ſee ſome Women empaled together with their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and ſo expos'd to the fury of greedy Dogs,
and others run through with Lances and Halberts.
They burnt one of the greateſt Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
with a gentle Fire, and inſultingly told him 'twas
to do him the more honour, that they put him to
death after this manner. Theſe Butcheries and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties
were committed for ſeven years together.
The Reader may conjecture what multitudes of poor
<hi>Indians</hi> were ſlaughter'd during ſo tedious and
bloody a Perſecution.</p>
                        <p>'Tis fit to be remark'd, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were
receiv'd with great Acclamations, and with all the
demonſtrations of a ſincere Joy in the Province of
<hi>Cuzcatan,</hi> which is ſituate on the Sea-ſide, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
forty or fifty Leagues in length. In this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
is the famous City of <hi>St. Saviour; Cuzcatan</hi> is
the Metropolis of the Province. Theſe People ſent
30000 <hi>Indians</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> laden with Indian
Poultry, and all other Proviſions the Country would
afford in great abundance. After they had receiv'd
theſe Preſents, the Spaniſh General order'd his Men
to chooſe as many <hi>Indians</hi> as each of 'em deſir'd for
their Service, while they remain'd in that Province:
Accordingly one took a hundred, another fifty, as
they had occaſion to carry their Baggage. Theſe
poor Wretches ſerv'd them with all the care and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57864:31"/>
diligence they could, and were even ready to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
'em. At length the General demanded of 'em
a great quantity of Gold, that being the main buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for which he came: they with a great deal of
Humility and Submiſſion, told him they would readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give him all they had, and preſently got together
all the Lances they had, which were made of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
gilt, and which they took for pure Gold by the
looks of it. The General ſoon made trial of it, and
finding what it was, addreſs'd himſelf to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
in theſe terms: <hi>We muſt carry Deſtruction with
us</hi> (ſays he) <hi>through all this Country, ſeeing here's no
Gold to be found: Every one of you may keep the</hi> Indians
<hi>you have choſen for your perpetual Slaves: You may load
'em with Chains, and brand 'em with the marks of their
Slavery:</hi> Which was immediately done: For they
printed the King's Arms with a hot Iron upon all
they could take. Thoſe of 'em that eſcap'd, provok'd
with the ill Treatment which they every where
met, aſſembled all the <hi>Indians</hi> they could to make an
Effort to deliver themſelves from the Perſecutions
of their Enemies by force of Arms; but their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
was not ſucceſsful, ſo that an incredible
number of 'em was kill'd.</p>
                        <p>After this Expedition the <hi>Spaniards</hi> return'd to
<hi>Guatimala,</hi> where they built a City; but God was
pleas'd by his juſt Judgment utterly to overthrow,
and deſtroy it. They kill'd all without Mercy whom
they ſuppos'd to be in a condition to incommode
'em by their Arms, and the reſt were condemn'd to
Slavery. They extorted from 'em a Tribute of
Boys and Girls, and ſent 'em into <hi>Peru</hi> to be ſold.
The other Inhabitants of this Kingdom, which is
100 Leagues in length, were likewiſe deſtroy'd.
Thus one of the moſt pleaſant and fruitful Countries
in the World was reduc'd to a melancholy Deſert.
The Governor himſelf has freely confeſs'd, that this
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57864:32"/>
was the moſt populous Country in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi>
not excepting <hi>Mexico</hi> it ſelf, which is certainly
true. In this noble Country the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
no leſs than four or five Millions of Men in
fifteen or ſixteen years, and continue every day to
treat thoſe that remain after the ſame manner.</p>
                        <p>Theſe inhuman Creatures were wont when they
declar'd War againſt any City or Province, to bring
with 'em as many of the conquer'd <hi>Indians</hi> as they
could, to make 'em fight againſt their Country-men;
ſometimes they had fifteen or twenty thouſand of
theſe new Subjects among 'em. But becauſe they
were not able to furniſh 'em with all neceſſary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
they allow'd 'em to eat thoſe other <hi>Indians</hi>
whom they took in War, ſo that in their Camp they
had Shambles ſtor'd with human Fleſh. Infants were
kill'd in their ſight, and then broil'd and eaten;
Men were ſlaughter'd like Beaſts, and their Legs
and Arms dreſs'd for food; for the <hi>Indians</hi> like the
taſte of thoſe Parts better than others. The News
of theſe horrible Practices ſoon alarm'd the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Countries, and fill'd 'em with Terror and
Conſternation.</p>
                        <p>Many of the <hi>Indians</hi> were worn out with carrying
the Tackle of the Spaniſh Ships, which they would
needs have brought from the North to the South
Sea, which are 130 Leagues diſtant: They made
'em carry Anchors of a great weight all this long
way; they laid great Guns upon the naked Backs of
theſe poor Creatures, under the weight of which
they were not able to ſtand; ſo that the greateſt
part of 'em dy'd by the way, not being able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
theſe Fatigues. To increaſe their Miſery, they
divided their Families, taking Husbands from their
Wives, and Wives from their Husbands; their
Daughters were taken from 'em, and given to the
Seamen and Souldiers to ſatisfy their Luſt, and to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57864:32"/>
appeaſe their murmuring. They fill'd the Ships
with <hi>Indians,</hi> and ſuffer'd 'em to periſh with Hunger
and Thirſt; becauſe they would take no care to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
'em with Neceſſaries. But to give a particular
account of all their Cruelties would require large
Volumes, the view of which would aſtoniſh all that
ſhould have the curioſity to look into 'em.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had two powerful Fleets deſtin'd
to the ſame purpoſe of deſtroying the poor <hi>Indians.</hi>
How many Parents have they bereav'd of their
Children! How many Children of their Parents!
of how many Adulteries and other infamous Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
have they been the Cauſes, the Actors, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices!
How many People have they inſlav'd!
What Miſeries and Calamities have they not brought
upon this new World! What Fountains of Tears
have they open'd! What Rivers of Blood have they
pour'd out! How many Lives have they taken away
after ſuch a manner as might render 'em yet more
miſerable in the other World! which is a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Reflection both in regard of the <hi>Indians</hi> who
have ſuffer'd ſo many Cruelties, and of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
who have been the Authors of ſo much Miſchief and
Villany.</p>

                        <head>Of New Spain, of Panuco and Xaliſco.</head>
                        <p>AFter the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had committed all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
Cruelties and Maſſacres in <hi>New
Spain,</hi> there came to <hi>Panuco</hi> another Tyrant as bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
and unmerciful as the former. He loaded his
Ships with multitudes of the Natives, and carried
'em to <hi>Cuba</hi> and <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> where they were ſold
for Slaves: ſo that in a little time he render'd the
whole Country deſtitute of People. Fourſcore of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57864:33"/>
theſe <hi>Indians</hi> (tho they have reaſonable Souls as
well as other Men) were exchang'd for one Horſe.
When the Preſident of the City of <hi>Mexico</hi> was made
Governor of all <hi>New Spain,</hi> there were alſo a great
many Aſſeſſors and Auditors made, who all rul'd
like ſo many petty Tyrants, and committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd
Cruelties and Outrages in the exerciſe
of their Offices. They acted ſuch abominable things,
and made the Country ſo deſolate in a very little
time, that if the Franciſcan Monks had not oppos'd
their Diſorders with a great deal of Courage and
Reſolution, and had not the Royal Council by their
Meſſages given Orders for the preſervation of this
Province, all <hi>New Spain</hi> had been ruin'd in leſs than
two years, and been made as deſolate as <hi>Hiſpaniola.</hi>
One of the Preſident's Companions employ'd eight
thouſand <hi>Indians</hi> to make a Wall round his Garden,
but he gave 'em neither Wages nor Victuals; ſo
that they almoſt all dy'd before the Work was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd:
neither the hard Labour they endur'd, nor
their Death could make this mercileſs Man relent.</p>
                        <p>After the former General, of whom we have
ſpoken above, had made an end of deſtroying and
waſting the Province of <hi>Panuco,</hi> and was inform'd
that the Royal Council would arrive in a little
time, he advanc'd farther into the Country, hoping
to find ſome new Province on which to exerciſe his
wonted Rapine. He forc'd fifteen or twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<hi>Indians</hi> to attend him, to carry the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
Baggage and Proviſions, which they did till they
all died in the way except two hundred. He came
at length into the Province of <hi>Mechuaca,</hi> about forty
Leagues from <hi>Mexico.</hi> The King of this Province
very civilly came out to meet him, and was as offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to ſerve him as could be deſir'd; but for his
reward was loaded with Irons, becauſe ſuppos'd to
have a great Treaſure by him; and the better to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57864:33"/>
extort great Sums from him, he was made to ſuffer
a great many Torments. His Hands being tied to
a Stake, and his Legs ſtretch'd out, they drop'd
burning Pitch on 'em, and baſted his Body with
boiling Oil from time to time, that his Skin might
be gradually roaſted. Over againſt him ſtood a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Souldier with a Bow ſhooting Arrows into his
Breaſt: Another let looſe hungry Dogs to bite and
tear him in every part; all theſe Tortures were to
make him confeſs where he had hid his Gold: And
theſe Cruelties would have been continued longer
if a Franciſcan Frier had not happen'd to come and
reſcue him out of their hands; however he could
not ſave his Life, for he expir'd ſoon after. Many
<hi>Caciques</hi> and great Men of this Province were put to
death after this manner, to make 'em confeſs where
they had hid their Gold and Silver.</p>
                        <p>About this time there arriv'd another Perſon in
this Country, who was more greedy of Money, than
ſolicitous about the Salvation of the poor <hi>Indians.</hi>
He happen'd to find ſome of their Idols which they
had hid, (for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would very ſeldom give
themſelves the trouble to inform theſe Idolaters of
the True God) Upon this he impriſon'd the moſt
conſiderable Perſons in the Nation, till they ſhould
diſcover to him where they had put their Idols, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſuppos'd theirs were made either of Gold
or Silver; but he fail'd in his Expectation: however
to mend the matter, he impos'd great Sums on the
<hi>Indians,</hi> which they were to pay for the redemption
of their Idols, that they might worſhip 'em after
their wonted manner. Theſe are the Improvements
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have been making in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi>
and this is their Zeal for the Glory of God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                        <p>After this Tyrant had run through the whole
Province of <hi>Mechuaca,</hi> and pillaged it, he came to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57864:34"/>
                           <hi>Xaliſquo,</hi> a Country very populous and fruitful, and
the moſt famous in all <hi>America;</hi> there are Towns
in it of ſeven Leagues in length. Theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> as
the others had done before, came out to meet him
with great expreſſions of Joy; but he ſoon left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
'em the marks of his Cruelty, which he had cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated
by long Experience. The noble Preſents
made this Tiger could not mollify him. His deſign
was to heap together a great quantity of Gold, this
was the only Idol he ador'd; and all means were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
to him, ſo he could but attain his end.
He ſet fire to all the Cities through which he paſs'd,
and deſtroy'd 'em to the very Foundation. He kept
thoſe of the higheſt Dignity priſoners, after he had
inflicted divers kinds of Torments on 'em. The
<hi>Spaniards</hi> loaded all the <hi>Indians</hi> they could take here
with Chains, which was a great number. The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
made Women big with Child carry their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
till they fainted and ſunk under their Burdens
with hunger and wearineſs. Others not able to
carry both the heavy Burdens they gave 'em, and
their Children too, were forc'd to leave theſe by the
way, by which means a prodigious number of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
periſh'd.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Spaniard</hi> attempting to raviſh a Virgin in the
preſence of her Mother, the Mother did what ſhe
could to hinder him; upon which, to prevent her
from farther oppoſing his brutiſh deſign, he drew
his Sword and cut off her Arms, and afterwards
kill'd her Daughter becauſe ſhe would by no means
conſent to his filthy Deſires, but reſiſted him with
a virtuous Indignation and Courage to her laſt
breath.</p>
                        <p>Four thouſand and five hundred of theſe poor <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
were branded with a hot Iron by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
who mark'd 'em thus for Slaves, tho they were
born free and independent. The very Children,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57864:34"/>
as well as thoſe that were grown to maturity, ſuffer'd
this Puniſhment and Infamy: They pretended they
had right to make a great number of 'em Slaves,
to defray the Charge of their long Travels; and
that they might lawfully make theſe poor Creatures
endure all ſorts of Torments, to force 'em to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
where they had hid their Gold: Some of 'em
they burnt, others were torn in pieces by hungry
Dogs; they cut off the Feet, Hands, Arms, Tongues,
and ſometimes the Heads of others, to terrify the
reſt by theſe ſad Spectacles, that they might oblige
'em the more eaſily to ſubmit to Slavery, or to ſhew
'em the places where they had ſecur'd their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
And all theſe things were acted with the
knowledg and conſent of the Governor, who would
ſometimes order more Blows to be given 'em, when
they were beat or whip'd, to compleat their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
                        <p>Fourſcore Towns and Villages at leaſt were burnt
in the Kingdom of <hi>Xaliſco:</hi> Which tragical ſight,
together with all the various Cruelties they ſuffer'd
every day, ſo provok'd the <hi>Indians,</hi> that they arm'd
themſelves and fell upon the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and kill'd
ſome of 'em: after which Expedition they fled up
into the Mountains, but at length were maſſacred in
this place of Refuge by other <hi>Spaniards</hi> who made
Excurſions through theſe Provinces to lay 'em waſte.
They put all of 'em to the Sword who made any
offer to defend themſelves, ſo that this place became
a horrible ſcene of Blood: And there is ſcarce any
Remnant of this once numerous People left. The
<hi>Spaniards</hi> were certainly blinded, harden'd and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
by the Almighty, that they made no Reflection
on the Laws of God or Men, which all forbid the
exerciſe of ſuch Violence as they have been guilty
of in <hi>America.</hi> They had no juſt occaſion given 'em
to drive the Inhabitants of thoſe Provinces from
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57864:35"/>
their Native Country by force of Arms, and to
maſſacre 'em ſo barbarouſly: they did not conſider
how unjuſt and criminal theſe Outrages were, and
how contrary it was to all the Laws of Nations, for
them to treat thoſe who had never injur'd 'em with
ſo much Cruelty. They pretend the Wars they
have made againſt theſe People are juſt and lawful;
that God hath left 'em to their Mercy, and that
they have right to make ſuch Conqueſts as theſe,
and to deſtroy all theſe Nations: So that it ſeems
they would fain make God himſelf Partner with 'em
in their Tyranny and Wickedneſs; and one may
well apply the words of the Prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi> to
'em: <hi>Feed the flock of the ſlaughter; whoſe Poſſeſſors
ſlay them, and hold themſelves not guilty: and they that
ſell them ſay, Bleſſed be the Lord, for I am rich; and
their own Shepherds pity them not.</hi> Chap. 11. 4, 5.</p>

The Kingdom of <hi>Yucatan</hi> contain'd a prodigious

Leagues in compaſs. The Inhabitants of it are more
polite, more civiliz'd, and better diſciplin'd in Morals,
and in what belongs to the good order of Societies,
than the reſt of the <hi>Indians.</hi> There is a remarkable
Prudence and Juſtneſs of Mind in them, which is not
to be found in others. Theſe natural Endowments
without doubt ought to have encouraged Chriſtians
to take the pains to inſtruct 'em in the knowledg of
the true God; and they ſeem'd to have no ſmall

Paradiſe: but their Stupidity, their Avarice, and

have render'd 'em unworthy of theſe Advantages.
They attack'd theſe poor <hi>Indians,</hi> who liv'd in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found

'em for Wine, Oil, Vinegar, ſalt Pork,
Horſes, and all other Neceſſaries. They would give
fifty or a hundred of the handſomeſt young Girls
for a meaſure of Wine, Oil or Vinegar, and would
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57864:36"/>
ſell a hundred or two of luſty well-made young Men
at the ſame rate. They ſwop'd a Prince's Son for
a Cheeſe, and a hundred Perſons of Eminency for a
Horſe. They continued in this Country till they
heard of the Riches of <hi>Peru,</hi> the News of which
made 'em leave it immediately, and thus their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions
ended in the Kingdom of <hi>Yucatan.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
before they went they committed all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
and Diſorders that can be imagin'd againſt
both God and Men: ſo that thoſe three hundred
Leagues of one of the fineſt Countries in the World,
that was very rich and full of People before their
arrival, were in a little time reduc'd to a vaſt
Deſert.</p>
                        <p>'Tis not eaſy to believe the Account of all the
villanous Actions they committed in this Kingdom:
I'll recite but two or three particular Facts. They
had prepar'd fierce Dogs which they kept hungry
to go a hunting after the poor <hi>Indians;</hi> as they were
hunting they lighted on a Woman that was ſick,
who not being in a condition to fly to avoid being
devour'd of the Dogs, hang'd her ſelf, after ſhe had
hang'd a Child ſhe had with her of a year old; the
Dogs preſently camt to her, and began to devour
her: but a certain Frier that was happily there
perceiving the Child not to be yet quite dead, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd it.</p>
                        <p>When they quitted this Kingdom, they invited
the Son of one of the Princes of the Country to
accompany 'em, who ſhew'd a great unwillingneſs to
abandon his Country to follow 'em, on which they
threatned to cut him in quarters if he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to their deſire. The Child ſtill perſiſting in
the ſame mind, one of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> drew his Sword
and cut off both his Ears: This ill Treatment how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
could not make him alter his purpoſe, upon
which this Brute cut off his Noſe and Lips, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57864:36"/>
laugh'd while he was committing this barbarous
Action.</p>
                        <p>Another brag'd that he had got many Indian
Women with Child, that he might ſell 'em for the
more Money. Some of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have been ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human
as to give Infants to their Hounds when they
were hungry: they would take theſe poor Babes by
the two Legs, and violently tear 'em aſunder into
two pieces, and then feed their Dogs with 'em,
They were left of God to ſuch a reprobate mind,
that they made no more account of human Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that were ranſom'd by the Blood of Jeſus
Chriſt, than of Beaſts.</p>
                        <p>I paſs over an infinite number of other unheard
of Cruelties, which ſurpaſs all Imagination. When
theſe covetous and ambitious Tyrants left the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Yucatan</hi> to go in ſearch after the greater
Riches of <hi>Peru,</hi> four Franciſcan Friers came thither
to comfort theſe miſerable People, and to endeavour
by their preaching to bring thoſe that had eſcap'd
the fury of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the knowledg of the true
God. The ſame Friers were very earneſtly ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
by many other <hi>Indians</hi> to come into their
Country likewiſe to teach 'em the Maxims of their
Religion. They aſſembled in great companies to
inform themſelves what ſort of Men theſe Religious.
Perſons were, who call'd one another <hi>Father</hi> and
<hi>Brother,</hi> to inquire into their true deſigns, and to know
wherein they differ'd from other <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who
had exercis'd ſo much Cruelty over all the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>
They were willing to entertain 'em on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
they would come alone to inſtruct 'em, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other <hi>Spaniards</hi> to attend 'em; which the
Friers promis'd very readily, aſſuring 'em they would
not offer 'em the leaſt Injury. The Governor of
<hi>New Spain</hi> likewiſe now order'd 'em to promiſe the
<hi>Indians,</hi> that they ſhould be treated more kindly
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57864:37"/>
for the time to come, and ſhould find no farther oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to complain of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Severity. Thus
theſe Religious Men began to preach the Goſpel of
Chriſt with a great deal of Zeal, and inform'd theſe
People moreover of the good Intentions of the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> towards 'em; ſo that in about forty days
time, they brought all their Idols to throw 'em in
the fire: they as readily brought their Children,
whom they bring up with a great deal of tenderneſs
and fondneſs, to be inſtructed; and built both Houſes
and Churches for theſe Friers with all the Affection
and Forwardneſs imaginable. All the ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
ſtrove with great Emulation for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
their Zeal was ſo great for the new Religion
they preach'd to 'em. So that what the Governors
could never obtain of the <hi>Indians</hi> in many years,
theſe Friers accompliſh'd in a very little time: for
the Princes and Great Men of theſe Provinces, at
the head of their People in a General Aſſembly,
voluntarily ſubmitted to the Government of the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whom they acknowledg'd for their
Soveraign, and put themſelves under his Protection;
as may be ſeen by the account theſe Friers ſent into
<hi>Spain</hi> ſign'd with their own hands.</p>
                        <p>Theſe pious Men were tranſported with Joy to
find a door open'd to 'em to preach the Goſpel in
theſe vaſt Provinces, to thoſe that had eſcap'd the
Barbarity of the ſeveral Governors, who had maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
ſuch prodigious numbers. About this time
there came into theſe parts eighteen Spaniſh Troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
with twelve foot Souldiers, who brought with
them abundance of Indian Idols which they had
taken out of other Provinces; the Commander of
theſe Souldiers ſent for one of the principal Chiefs of
the Nation, and commanded him to take theſe Idols
and diſtribute 'em throughout the Country, and to
bring him Indian Men and Women in exchange for
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57864:37"/>
'em, threatning him with a ſevere War if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
to obey him. This Prince was ſo terrified
with theſe Menaces, that he carried away all theſe
Idols, and diſpos'd 'em in the ſeveral Cities of his
Province, requiring the People in the name of this
Spaniſh Captain to worſhip theſe falſe Gods, and to
render 'em all the Honour and Service they were
formerly wont to do. To recompenſe this Action
they gave him liberty to make as many Slaves as he
pleas'd. The <hi>Indians,</hi> frighted with the threatnings
that were made 'em, deliver'd up their own Children;
he that had two gave one, and he that had three
gave two. This was the Event of this impious
Traffick, the <hi>Cacyque</hi> being forced to obey the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Spaniſh Captain. One of theſe ungodly
Wretches, whoſe name was <hi>John Garcia,</hi> being taken
dangerouſly ſick, and ready to expire, bethought
himſelf that he had a conſiderable number of theſe
Idols under his Bed; and therefore order'd an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Woman that he kept to ſell 'em, telling her ſhe
might make a good market of 'em, the matter of
which being very valuable, he told her every Image
was at leaſt fairly worth an Indian in exchange.
This was the <hi>Spaniards</hi> laſt Will and Teſtament,
and theſe were the marks he gave of the pious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of his Mind, and in the midſt of ſuch Cares
as theſe he gave up the Ghoſt. By this Story it may
eaſily be conjectur'd what good Examples the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
ſet before the <hi>Indians,</hi> and what progreſs the
Catholick Religion is likely to make among theſe
People; who being Eye-witneſſes of ſuch Actions as
theſe, eaſily perceive that the <hi>Europeans</hi> have ſo
little ſentiment of Religion, that they don't much
care whether poor Infidels be reduc'd to pay the true
God that Worſhip and Honour they owe him, or
not. It can hardly be ſaid that <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Crime,
who caus'd two Golden Calves to be caſt, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57864:38"/>
his Subjects to worſhip 'em, is more hainous
than that of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who drive ſuch an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
trade with Idols, and occaſion ſo much
ſcandal by this ſhameful kind of Traffick. This is
the manner of their Conduct and Behaviour in the
new World. They ſacrifice every thing to their
deteſtable Avarice, and ſell Chriſt Jeſus himſelf for
Gold. They are every day renouncing him, and
diſhonouring his Religion by the many infamous
Crimes of which they are guilty.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſtill continue to
ruin their Country, notwithſtanding all the expreſs
Promiſes the Friers had made 'em that they would
abſtain for the future from their wonted Robberies;
and that inſtead of mending their own Lives, they
brought Idols even from other Countries to expoſe
to ſale among them, who had voluntarily reſign'd
their own to the Friers to be committed to the
Flames, being reſolv'd to worſhip but one God in
their Country for time to come: Seeing all this
(I ſay) they were extremely enrag'd at the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
and no leſs provok'd againſt the Friers, whom
they accoſted after this manner. <hi>Why</hi> (ſay they)
<hi>have you deceiv'd us thus by your falſe Promiſes? Did
not you aſſure us the</hi> Spaniards <hi>ſhould no more invade
and oppreſs us? Why have you burnt our Gods, to bring
us ſtrange Gods out of other Countries? Are theſe better
or mightier than our own?</hi> The poor Friers endeavor'd
to appeaſe 'em as well as they could, tho they ſcarce
knew how to anſwer their Complaints, having no
good Reaſons to offer to excuſe the matter. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they applied themſelves to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
'em for having ſo exceedingly ſcandaliz'd
the <hi>Indians,</hi> and conjur'd 'em to leave the Country,
which they abſolutely refus'd to do; and which was
ſtill more vile and unworthy, they perſwaded the
<hi>Indians</hi> that they had not come into their Country
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57864:38"/>
but at the requeſt of theſe Friers: Which pretence
had the ſucceſs they deſired; for the <hi>Indians</hi> giving
credit to theſe Stories, reſolv'd to kill the poor
Friers; but ſome of 'em giving 'em notice of the
Deſign, they made their eſcape in the night. After
they were gone, the <hi>Indians</hi> perceiv'd they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
on, and receiv'd full information of the Malice
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the baſe trick they had play'd
'em, and therefore diſpatch'd a Meſſage to the Friers
to entreat 'em to return, and forgive the fault they
had committed, aſſuring 'em they heartily repented
of their Ingratitude.</p>
                        <p>Theſe pious Men that were devoted to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, and animated with an ardent Zeal for
the Salvation of Souls, confiding in the Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the <hi>Indians,</hi> return'd to 'em according to
their requeſt, and were receiv'd as if they had been
Angels come down from Heaven: they continued
three or four Months among 'em, receiving abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of reſpect and kindneſs from 'em. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
who ſtill refus'd to quit the Country, tho
the Vice-roy had expreſly order'd 'em ſo to do, and
had us'd all his Authority to oblige 'em to it, were
declar'd Rebels and Traitors; however this did not
hinder 'em from continuing their Rapine and Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
And tho the Friers were ſatisfied they would
not always eſcape with Impunity, yet they fear'd it
might be a long time before they receiv'd their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts;
and conſidering moreover that the continual
Inſults they made on the <hi>Indians,</hi> depriv'd them of
the liberty of preaching to 'em, upon the whole
they thought meet to reſolve to leave this Kingdom,
which was depriv'd of the light of the Goſpel by
the Malice of the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> and thus theſe poor
<hi>Indians</hi> who manifeſted ſuch good Inclinations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Chriſtianity, were abandon'd to their former
Darkneſs and Idolatry, in which they continue to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57864:39"/>
this day, while thoſe profligate Wretches ſtill by
the ſame Obſtacles in the way of their Converſion.
When theſe Friers were conſtrain'd to retire out of
the Country, the <hi>Indians</hi> began to imbrace the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Religion with a great deal of Zeal and Fervor;
but being unhappily depriv'd of all means of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
they wither'd like tender Plants, for want
of Water.</p>

                     <div type="part">
                        <head>Of the Province of St. Martha.</head>
                        <p>THE Province of <hi>St. Martha</hi> was famous for the
rich Golden Mines that are near it, and for
the fruitfulneſs of its Soil. The People are nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and very skilful in getting Gold out of the
Mines, which eaſily engag'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that in great numbers; they made conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Excurſions over all this fine Country to ravage
and ſpoil it; they maſſacred vaſt numbers of the
Inhabitants, took away all their Gold, and fill'd their
Ships, which ſerv'd 'em for Magazines, with the Booty.
They ſoon laid waſte this flouriſhing Province by
the Robberies and Villanies they committed: they
did the greateſt miſchief upon the Sea-coaſts, but
they ſoon after pierc'd higher up into the Country,
where they endeavour'd to make a Settlement. The
Country being rich and fertile, divers Spaniſh Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
ſucceſſively invaded it with their Troops, and
the laſt was ſtill more cruel and inhuman than his
Predeceſſor. They ſeem'd ambitious to outvie one
another in the Enormity of their Crimes and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
In the year 1520, a Spaniſh General attended
with a great many Souldiers enter'd into this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
with a reſolution of ruining it entirely. He
continued there for ſeven years together, and carried
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57864:39"/>
away an immenſe Treaſure with him; at laſt he
was condemn'd to be baniſh'd, and dyed in his
Exile without ſhewing the leaſt token of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
Thoſe who ſucceeded him went on to maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre
thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> that he and other Tyrants had
ſpared; they made both the common People, and
the Nobility of this Province ſuffer moſt horrible
Torments, to oblige 'em by the violence of their
pain to diſcover their Gold: they laid this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
waſte for above 40 Leagues, not leaving one
ſoul alive; tho this Province was well ſtock'd with
Inhabitants before their arrival.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>To give a particular Relation of all the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances,
Maſſacres and Deſolations, of all the Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Villanies committed by the</hi> Spaniards <hi>in this
Province againſt God, againſt the King, and againſt
the innocent</hi> Indians, <hi>would require a large Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
I muſt therefore content my ſelf to paſs over
many Circumſtances after a curſory manner. The
Biſhop of this Province, writing to the King of</hi>
Spain <hi>in the year 1541, among other things thus
expreſſes himſelf:</hi> Great Sir, To redreſs the Grievances
of this Province, it ought to be deliver'd from the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of thoſe that ravage it, and committed to the
Care of Perſons of Integrity, who will treat the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
with more kindneſs and humanity; for if it be
left to the mercy of the Governours, who commit all ſorts
of Outrages with impunity, 'twill be deſtroy'd in a very
little time. <hi>The ſame Biſhop farther adds in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>
The ill Conduct of the Governours may well engage
your Majeſty to deprive 'em abſolutely of their Places,
to relieve theſe Provinces; and if this courſe be not
taken, the diſeaſe will be incurable. I am neceſſitated
to let your Majeſty know, that the Spaniards who
come into this New World, live here rather like Devils
than Chriſtians; they neither ſerve God nor the King;
they violate all the Laws of God and Men with Impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57864:40"/>
Nothing can be a greater hindrance to the Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Indians,</hi> than the ill Treatment and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they make 'em ſuffer continually. Theſe People na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
love peace and quietneſs; but the barbarous uſage
they meet with from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> inſpires 'em with horror
and indignation againſt all Chriſtians, whom they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
call in their Language <hi>Yares,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Devils.</hi>
Nor is it without reaſon that they appear ſo odious and
abominable to theſe poor Creatures, ſince the Actions
they ſee 'em commit, are more like thoſe of Devils, than
of reaſonable Creatures, or Chriſtians. For while the
<hi>Indians</hi> ſee the Officers as well as Souldiers commit ſuch
deteſtable Crimes; they believe the Laws of Chriſtianity
authorize theſe inhuman Actions, and that neither our
God nor our King forbids 'em. 'Tis to no purpoſe to
pretend to undeceive 'em, and remove theſe Prejudices,
as the Caſe ſtands; 'tis but only to expoſe the Laws and
Religion of Chriſt the more to the Contempt of theſe Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters.
The <hi>Indians</hi> now begin to defend themſelves from
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by force of Arms; and chooſe rather to
periſh together at once than to ſuffer a thouſand deaths by
the Cruelty of theſe unmerciful Men. Your Majeſty has
more Servants in this New World than you imagine;
for there are none who bear Arms in theſe vaſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and make it their buſineſs to plunder, kill, and
burn, but give out that they are employ'd here in your
Majeſty's buſineſs, and endeavour to perſwade the World
that 'tis by your Majeſty's Order, and for your Interest,
that they do all this Miſchief to the <hi>Indians:</hi> tho the
Truth is, they uſe 'em after this violent manner, only
to enrich themſelves by plundering 'em of all they have.
It ſeems abſolutely neceſſary for your Majeſty to ſtop the
Courſe of theſe Robbers by ſome Exemplary Puniſhment;
and that your Majeſty declare you will have none of
their Services, who ſo highly diſhonour God and Religion.</p>
                        <p>Thus far the Letter which the Biſhop of St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi>
wrote to his Catholick Majeſty: By which it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57864:40"/>
may be conjectur'd how the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have abus'd
the poor <hi>Indians.</hi> They in deriſion and ſcorn call
thoſe the Warlike <hi>Indians,</hi> that fly into the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to ſave their Lives. And when they force
theſe miſerable People, to travel in rough and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
ways, ſweating under the great Burdens
they oblige 'em to carry, not content with having
overloaded 'em, they aggravate their miſery by
beating 'em unmercifully, and bruiſing their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with the pommels of their Swords, till the poor
Wretches driven to deſpair with all this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
often cry out, <hi>I can hold out no longer; kill
me out-right; put an end to my Miſeries by a ſpeedy
Death.</hi> And many deep ſighs accompany theſe
Expreſſions, which ſometimes they are ſcarce able
to utter, their Strength is ſo exhauſted with their
Toil, their Wearineſs, and the unmerciful Blows
which they give 'em, without any regard to their
other Miſeries.</p>

on 'em with abundance of alacrity and joy; they

ſupply Strangers with all the Neceſſaries they

make 'em build a vaſt houſe, that all the <hi>Indians</hi>
might lodg together in the ſame place; they us'd
this Artifice to catch 'em in the ſnare they were

their Throats, if they made any ſtir or diſturbance;
and ſo bound 'em all like ſo many Sheep. If any
one attempted to make his eſcape, they immediately
cut him in pieces; however divers of 'em eſcaped,
ſome whole and others wounded, who joining with
thoſe that had not yet been ſhut up in this fatal
Houſe, and arming themſelves with Bows and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
to the number of 200, retir'd into another
Houſe, where they thought themſelves ſecure, if
they could defend the door againſt the <hi>Spaniards;</hi>
but theſe ſet it on fire on the other ſide, and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſtroy'd theſe poor Creatures. After this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Expedition they retreated into the Iſland of
St. <hi>John</hi> with about 180 Priſoners, who had ſuffer'd
themſelves to be bound; where they ſold half of 'em,
and the reſt in <hi>Hiſpaniola.</hi> When I ſeverely reprov'd

you trouble your ſelf about theſe matters; they that ſent
me gave me Orders to act after this manner, and to
take all thoſe by force that I could not bring away under
the ſhadow and pretence of Peace.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were
guilty of a world of ſuch baſe Actions, in ſeizing
theſe <hi>Indians</hi> contrary to their promiſes that they
would treat 'em like Friends.</p>
                        <p>Let any one now make reflection on the Conduct
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and ſee if they have any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of right to reduce the Inhabitants of <hi>America,</hi>
as they do, to ſuch a miſerable ſtate of bondage. It
was reſolv'd among the Dominican Friers to ſend
ſome of their Order, to diſplay the Light of the
Goſpel among the <hi>Indians</hi> that liv'd in the groſs dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Idolatry, and were out of the way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
They firſt ſent one that was a Licentiate in
Divinity, of great reputation for his Piety and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
who took with him a Lay-brother: they both
went through this Country to ſeek a commodious
place for the building of a Monaſtry; and conferr'd
with ſome of the Inhabitants what meaſures to take
to ſucceed in this deſign. When the other Friers were
arriv'd, the <hi>Indians</hi> receiv'd 'em as if they had been
Meſſengers ſent from Heaven; they manifeſted abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of affection to 'em, heard what they ſaid
with great attention, as far as they were capable of
underſtanding them; for theſe religious Perſons
not being yet ſufficiently acquainted with their
Language, were conſtrain'd to make uſe of ſigns to
expreſs their meaning.</p>
                        <p>No ſooner was the Ship that brought the Friers
gone off, but there came another full of Souldiers,
who made uſe of Treachery and Artifice, according
to their wicked Cuſtom, to ſeize the Prince of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
unknown to the Friers. This Prince's name was
<hi>Alfonſo,</hi> which was given him either by the Friers, or
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57864:43"/>
ſome other <hi>Spaniards;</hi> for theſe <hi>Indians</hi> take upon 'em
Chriſtian Names with a great deal of Joy; and before
they are inſtructed in our Myſteries, very eagerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to be baptized. This Prince <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> together with
his Princeſs, not aware of the Artifices of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
and the deceitful trick they had reſolv'd to play 'em,
were perſwaded to go on board one of their Ships,
and many other <hi>Indians</hi> did the like, being all made
to believe there was a great Feaſt prepar'd for 'em;
and they needed the leſs importunity to entice 'em
into the Ship, becauſe they ſuppos'd the Friers, in
whom they put abundance of Cofidence, had Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
and Authority enough among the Soldiers to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
'em from all manner of danger: otherwiſe
they would not have ſo eaſily truſted themſelves in
the hands of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The very moment they
enter'd the Veſſel, theſe perfidious Men ſet ſail, and
carried 'em to <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> where they ſold 'em for
Slaves. All the Country was alarm'd at the ſad
tidings that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had carried away their
Prince and Princeſs; and came in Crowds to ſeek
the Friers, who narrowly eſcap'd being kill'd by 'em.
Theſe good men were extreamly griev'd at the
treachery us'd with theſe poor People; and would
rather have died than ſuffer'd theſe Outrages to
be on all occaſions committed againſt 'em, if they
could have prevented 'em, becauſe theſe were the
great obſtacles that hinder'd 'em from embracing the
Catholick Religion. However, the <hi>Indians</hi> were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peas'd
by the promiſes the Friers made 'em, that
they would write by the firſt Veſſel that ſhould
go to <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> to procure their Prince and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
to be ſent back. Accordingly a Veſſel being
in a little time prepar'd for this Voyage, they
made uſe of the opportunity to write to <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi>
to engage theſe Robbers to reſtore their Prey, which
they obſtinately refus'd to do, the Governours of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57864:44"/>
that Iſland having had a ſhare in the Booty. Theſe
good Friers who had given their word to the <hi>Indians,</hi>
that their Prince <hi>Alfonſo</hi> and his Princeſs ſhould be
reſtor'd to em in four months, ſeeing twice four
Months elaps'd without any hope of their return,
were oblig'd to prepare for death; there was now
no way to avoid ſhedding their blood for the Glory
of Chriſt, and in his Service, which Sacrifice they
had offer'd in the ready diſpoſition of their Minds
to ſuffer before they came from <hi>Spain:</hi> In ſhort,
they were maſſacred by the <hi>Indians,</hi> who believed
they were Accomplices of the foremention'd Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery;
and thought their ſuſpicion well founded,
becauſe the Friers had promis'd to redreſs their
Grievance in four months time; and yet they ſaw
theſe promiſes produc'd no effect: Beſides, theſe
Barbarians make no great difference between thoſe
religious Men that go to the <hi>Indies</hi> only to inſtruct
and preach to 'em, and the Spaniſh Souldiers who
go thither only to enrich themſelves by robbing 'em.
However, theſe good Fathers were unjuſtly put to
death; and one may without ſcruple place 'em in
the Order of Martyrs, and conclude they are now
enjoying God in the glory of Heaven. They obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently
reſign'd themſelves to go into <hi>America</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the direction of their Superiours, and
had no other intention in their Voyage, but that of
preaching the Chriſtian Faith to theſe Idolaters,
and of putting 'em in the way of Salvation, with a
reſolution to ſuffer any hardſhips, or even death it
ſelf, in the proſecution of ſo pious a Deſign.</p>
                        <p>The cruel Treatment the <hi>Indians</hi> met with from
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> occaſioned 'em likewiſe to kill two
Dominican Friers about the ſame time. There was
in theſe Provinces, near the Gulf of <hi>Codera,</hi> a City,
the Prince of which was nam'd <hi>Higuerote;</hi> who was
naturally of a ſweet and amicable temper, and his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57864:44"/>
Subjects civil and complaiſant: when the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
came firſt aſhore in his Country, the Inhabitants treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
'em with abundance of Kindneſs; they ſupplied
'em with Proviſions and Stores in great plenty;
and omitted nothing they were capable of doing
to refreſh and recruit 'em after the fatigues and
troubles of their Voyage. This Prince had ſav'd
the lives of a great many <hi>Europeans,</hi> who had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd
their Cruelty and Oppreſſion in other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
when they came to his Coaſts half dead with
hunger and wearineſs; and after he had recruited
'em with his good Entertainment, ſent 'em ſafe and
in a good ſtate of health to the Iſle of <hi>Pearls,</hi> which
was the ordinary Reſidence of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> tho
he might have ſecurely kill'd 'em all, without being
ever ſuſpected of the fact. Upon this the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
were ſo well perſwaded of <hi>Higuerote</hi>'s good inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
toward 'em, that they took his houſe for their
home, and were as kindly entertain'd in it as they
could expect to be in their own. While this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
thus enjoy'd a profound Peace, a Spaniſh Captain
coming aſhore there, invited divers of the Inhabitants
to come on board his Veſſel; which they often did,
from the entire confidence they had in the repeated
Promiſes the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made 'em that they would
do 'em no injury: At length when many of 'em
were got into the Ship, the Captain gave a Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
to put out to Sea, and ſail'd directly for the Iſle
of <hi>St. John,</hi> where he ſold all the poor Creatures,
whom he had thus perfidiouſly ſurpriz'd. I ſoon
after arriv'd in the ſame Iſland, where I ſaw this
Robber, and had a particular account given me of
the Circumſtances of this villanous Action; and it
ſeems, to compleat the Crime, he utterly deſtroy'd
this Prince's City. Theſe things were not well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by the reſt of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that us'd to cruiſe
up and down the neighbouring Coaſts to pillage 'em;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57864:45"/>
for they could not but abhor the Action of this Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that he ſhould by ſo infamous a piece of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
abuſe this Indian Chief, who had done 'em ſo
many good Offices from time to time, and was wont
to entertain 'em as if they had been his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> took away above two Millions of
Men from the Coaſts of theſe Provinces, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
'em into the Iſlands of <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> and <hi>St. John,</hi>
where the greateſt part periſh'd in the Mines, or
by other Hardſhips which they made 'em ſuffer. It
would produce Compaſſion in the hardeſt Hearts,
to ſee theſe Coaſts that were once ſo full of People
now abſolutely deſert. It has been obſerv'd by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Trials, that one third part of the Slaves which
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> take on board their Veſſels die by the
way, beſides thoſe they kill when they ſearch their
Houſes to take theſe poor Wretches away. The
end the <hi>Spaniards</hi> propoſe to themſelves, which is
to get Riches at any rate in the world, induces 'em
to commit all this Violence; they carry away great
numbers of Slaves, to produce conſiderable Sums of
Mony, and yet take but a ſmall quantity of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in their Ships to maintain all theſe People, for
fear of being at too great a charge in tranſporting
'em; nay ſometimes they have ſcarce enough for the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> that man the Ship: ſo that many of the
<hi>Indians</hi> periſh miſerably with Hunger and Thirſt;
and ſometimes they caſt the greateſt part of 'em
over board, to preſerve the reſt. A certain Pilot
told me, that in a Voyage he once made from
the <hi>Lucay</hi> Iſlands to <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> which is about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
Leagues, he had no need either of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs,
or the obſervation of the Stars to guide his
Veſſel; for he aſſur'd me the floating Bodies of
the <hi>Indians</hi> that had been thrown into the Sea,
ſerv'd for his Guide throughout this Paſſage, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57864:45"/>
conducted him ſtraight to the port to which he
was bound.</p>
                        <p>To ſee the <hi>Indians</hi> arrive in any Iſland where they
deſign to ſell 'em, can't but excite Compaſſion and
Trouble in every Mind that is not diveſted of all
Sentiments of Humanity: To ſee a great number
of Men. Women and Children ſtark naked, and ſo
worn out with Hunger and Hardſhip, that many of
'em can ſcarce ſtand, and others fall down with Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and to ſee 'em divided into ſeveral Companies
like Sheep, Husbands ſeparated from their Wives,
and Children from their Parents; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
are wont to divide 'em by ten or twenty in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and then to caſt Lots which ſhare each Man
ſhall have. This is the trade of theſe Pirats, who
arm and fit out Veſſels on purpoſe to carry away
theſe poor Wretches from their own Houſes, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
themſelves by ſelling 'em for Slaves. When a
<hi>Spaniard</hi> happens to have an old or ſick Man fall to
his ſhare among the reſt, he'll complain of ſuch a
Lot, and ſay to his Companions, <hi>Why d'ye give me
this old Fellow that's good for nothing? he is not worth his
keeping: What ſhall I do with this ſick Slave, that will
only be a charge to me, and can do me no Service?</hi> 'Tis
eaſy to ſee by all this how little account they make
of theſe People, and what little regard they have
to the Rules of Chriſtian Charity; 'tis too evident
they neither have any love to God, nor to their
Neighbour, tho on theſe two (as our Saviour ſays)
both the Law and the Prophets depend.</p>
                        <p>The deteſtable Cruelty and Tyranny of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
in inſnaring and ſeizing theſe poor <hi>Indians,</hi>
when they go in queſt of 'em to inſlave 'em, and
employ 'em in fiſhing for Pearls, is ſcarce to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd.
The Torments they make theſe unfortunate
People endure, can ſcarce be compar'd to any leſs
than thoſe of Hell. What they ſuffer in the Gold
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57864:46"/>
Mines, tho very terrible, yet is far inferior to that
we are now relating. They make 'em dive in the
Sea five or ſix fathom under water (where they are
forc'd to hold their Breath) to take up Mother of
Pearl; and when they come up to the ſurface of the
Water with Nets full of thoſe Shells, to get a little
Breath, if they keep above water ſomething longer
than ordinary to refreſh themſelves a little, a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs
<hi>Spaniard</hi> who attends with a Boat, beats and
abuſes 'em without meaſure, and often takes 'em by
the hair of the head, to force 'em again under
water, to continue their fiſhing. They feed 'em
with a little Fiſh and a piece of dry hungry Bread,
and don't give 'em a Belly full of that neither; they
have no other Bed than the hard ground on which
they make 'em ſleep in their Chains, for fear they
ſhould run away. They are often drown'd in fiſhing
thus for Pearl, or elſe devour'd by a ſort of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſters,
that will ſwallow a Man whole, ſo that
they hear no more of 'em.</p>
                        <p>'Tis no hard matter to perceive by what has been
ſaid, that the Precept of Chriſtian Charity is ill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
in this kind of fiſhing, ſeeing theſe poor
Slaves are expos'd to imminent danger of periſhing
both in Soul and Body. The Avarice of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
who mind nothing but Gain, is ſuch, that
they ſcarce take any care to inſtruct their Slaves,
and to fortify 'em by communicating the Sacraments
to 'em. They oppreſs 'em with ſo much Labour
and Fatigue, that they die in a little time; and 'tis
impoſſible Men ſhould continue long under water
without Reſpiration, and endure the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
they ſuffer in holding their Breath: The
coldneſs of the Water ſometimes makes 'em vomit
Blood; and they ſoon die, partly by having their
Stomachs ſo violently preſs'd by long holding of
their Breath under water, and partly by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57864:46"/>
Cold they endure, which cauſes that flux of
Blood of which I have juſt now ſpoken. Tho they
have naturally black Hair, the Fatigue they undergo
changes the colour of it; ſo that it becomes like the
Hair of Sea-wolves. The foam of the Sea ſticks ſo
faſt to their Shoulders, and in ſuch a manner, that they
look more like Monſters than Men. By this fiſhing
trade the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have deſtroy'd all the People of
the <hi>Lucay</hi>-Iſlands, which were the moſt skilful and
experienc'd in this Employment; and the reaſon
why one of thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> was ſold for fifty Crowns
or more, and ſometimes for a hundred, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were marvellouſly dextrous at ſwimming
and diving. However, thoſe of other Provinces
were employ'd too in this work when they could
take 'em; ſo that by this means an infinite number
of People have been deſtroy'd.</p>

                        <p>IN the year 1526, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> abus'd by the
Artifices of ſome ill-deſigning People, who made
uſe of a thouſand fetches and excuſes to conceal

Juriſdiction and Power to do what they pleas'd there,
and to diſpoſe of the Country as they thought

be of a meek, tractable and peaceful Diſpoſition, as
indeed the <hi>Indians</hi> generally are when left to their
natural Temper, and not enrag'd by the Abuſes ſo
often offer'd 'em. Theſe were ſtill more brutiſh
and cruel than thoſe <hi>Spaniards</hi> of whom we have
been hitherto ſpeaking: They exceeded Tygers,
Wolves and Lions in Barbarity, when they ſaw
themſelves Maſters of this great Kingdom, in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion

to do there whatever they pleas'd, and that
they might ſatisfy their Covetouſneſs at any rate,
and by all the methods they could imagine, tho
never ſo unjuſt. They took no care but how to heap

they ſeem'd to have utterly forgotten that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
were Men, having put on ſuch an inhuman and
ſavage Fierceneſs; or to come yet nearer to their
true Character, they appear'd like ſo many Devils
in the ſhape of Men.</p>
                        <p>They ran through theſe rich and pleaſant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
and inſtantly laid the Country waſte for forty
Leagues together, wherein were fruitful Vallies of
a prodigious extent, and Towns and Villages ſtor'd
with great quantities of Gold. The deſtruction
they made was ſo general, that ſcarce a Man was
left to carry the News of the Cruelties they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
in this Kingdom to other Provinces: none
but thoſe that hid themſelves in Caves and Holes of
the Earth, could eſcape the Sword of theſe furious
and inhuman Creatures. They invented new kinds
of Puniſhments wherewith to torment 'em, to force
'em to part with their Gold by diſcovering the places
where they had hid it: After this manner they
deſtroy'd three or four Millions of People. The
Inſtances of three or four Facts will ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
how theſe Brutes behav'd themſelves in this
Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>One of the firſt things they did, was to ſeize him,
whom they look'd upon as the Soveraign Prince of
the whole Kingdom; they loaded him with Irons
to get the more Gold out of him: they endeavour'd
by the Tortures to which they put him, to make
him diſcover the places where he had ſecur'd his
Treaſures; but he had the good fortune to eſcape
their hands, and fly into the Mountains: His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ſurrounded him, and hid him in the Woods;
but their number was too great to be long conceal'd:
ſo that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> purſued 'em with Swords in
their hands, and made a dreadful Maſſacre among
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57864:48"/>
'em; others of them they took alive, and ſold for
Slaves.</p>
                        <p>Before the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had took their King Priſoner,
they were receiv'd in all theſe Provinces with ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
dancing, and all the higheſt demonſtrations of
Joy, as if come to bring Peace and Plenty with 'em
into the Country: They frankly and voluntarily
gave 'em immenſe Sums of Gold and Silver; for
which all the Compenſation they had was to be
run through, and cut with Lances and Swords, and
maſſacred without pity. One day when they came
out to meet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to do 'em the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
the <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Commander having order'd a
great number of 'em to aſſemble together in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

ſome of the poor Wretches got upon the Beams to

Commander caus'd the Houſe to be fir'd, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
them in the Flames. The whole Country
was ſoon turn'd into a Deſert; for all that eſcap'd
the Souldiers Rage retir'd into the Mountains.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> after this paſs'd into a vaſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
upon the Confines of that of <hi>St. Martha,</hi>
where they found the Natives following their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
buſineſs in profound Peace. All the while they
continued here they liv'd at the charge of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
who ſerv'd 'em with as much Affection and
Diligence, as if they had ow'd their Lives to 'em:
nay, they bore with their troubleſom Humors, and
continually receiv'd ill Treatment from 'em with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
Patience. The <hi>Indians</hi> moreover to qualify
their ill Temper, brought 'em a prodigious quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Gold, and many other things of great value.
Yet theſe Tyrants, when upon the point of leaving
'em, inſtead of gratefully acknowledging all the
good Offices they had receiv'd of 'em, reſolv'd to
put 'em all to the Sword. The <hi>Flemiſh</hi> General

(who has ſince been ſuppos'd to be a Heretick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he never went to Maſs himſelf, nor ſuffer'd
others to go) commanded his Men to take all the
<hi>Indians</hi> with their Wives and Children, and put 'em
into ſome very large place capable of containing
'em all; and then to declare to 'em that if they had
a mind to redeem their Liberty, with that of their
Wives and Children, they muſt neceſſarily lay down
a certain Sum, which this unjuſt Governor had tax'd
'em according to his own capricious Humour; and
to urge 'em the more to anſwer his Requirement, he
barbarouſly prohibited his Men to give any Victuals
to theſe poor Creatures, till each of 'em had paid
the Sum impos'd on him. Many of 'em ſent to their
Houſes for the Sum demanded, being willing to do
what they could to redeem their Liberty, and to
have leave to go ſeek ſomething to eat: Yet they
were no ſooner got out of the Clutches of this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
Governor, but he inſtantly ſent Soldiers to
take 'em again, and ſubject 'em to the ſame Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from which they had ranſom'd themſelves
with ſo much difficulty: ſo that they dy'd in this
Captivity with Hunger and Thirſt, unleſs they ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
bought their Liberty again, which they forc'd
'em to do by this barbarous uſage. So that many
of 'em were taken and retaken thus three or four
times, and every time oblig'd to ranſom themſelves
with great Sums. Thoſe that were not able to pay
the Tax laid upon 'em, continued in this cruel Priſon
till they pin'd away with Hunger and Miſery. Thus
was this opulent Province that abounded with Gold,
made deſolate in a very little time. There was one
pleaſant and fertile Vale ravag'd by theſe Brutes,
which extended no leſs than forty Leagues; they
burnt a Town in it conſiſting of a thouſand Houſes.
After this reſolving to advance farther into the
Country to diſcover a new way to <hi>Peru,</hi> they made
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57864:49"/>
uſe of a multitude of <hi>Indians</hi> in this Journey, whom
they loaded with Chains, and their Baggage toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
thoſe that fainted under their Burdens with
wearineſs, they kill'd upon the ſpot, cutting of
their heads; and divided the Burdens of them that
died among the Survivors.</p>
                        <p>If one could exactly deſcribe all the Ravage and
Maſſacres the <hi>Spaniards</hi> commited in this Province,
together with all the Towns they fir'd, ſo deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Story would fill every Reader with horror, and
almoſt ſurpaſs belief. Many other Tyrants came
afterward into this Province, who follow'd the ſteps
of the former in ſearching for Gold and other Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
but they found the Country ſo burnt, pillag'd
and deſolate, tho it had heretofore been both very
populous and fertile, that they themſelves could
not but ſtand amaz'd to think what Cruelties the
poor <hi>Indians</hi> had endur'd.</p>
                        <p>All theſe Violences were plainly prov'd by the
Procurator of the Treaſury of the Council of the
<hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> The Acts and Proceedings made in
this Affair are yet preſerv'd upon record; yet not
one of theſe Tyrants was ever put to death for
the Injuries offer'd theſe poor <hi>Indians:</hi> ſo that all
the Proceſs that was made againſt 'em prov'd to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little purpoſe. Thoſe Miniſters of Juſtice that
have been hitherto ſent into the <hi>Indies</hi> have regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nothing but their Intereſt; and ſtudied how to
enrich themſelves without taking the trouble to
examin and puniſh the Crimes of theſe Tyrants,
who did ſo much miſchief, and committed ſo many
Outrages on the poor <hi>Indians.</hi> They content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to ſay in general, that ſuch and ſuch have
committed great Crimes, and abus'd the Inhabitants of
the New World; that they have leſſen'd the King's
Revenues to ſuch a degree. But when they have
made theſe looſe and general Enquiries, they go no
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57864:49"/>
farther: Whereas more effectual Remedies ought
to be uſed to ſtop the Courſe of all theſe Miſchiefs.
There is not ſo much care taken as to evidence and
verify theſe matters; nor do they give their Acts
and Proceedings all the Life and Authority they
ought: for to diſcharge their Duty faithfully to
God and the King, they ſhould make ſuch Tyrants
as theſe reſtore all the Plunder they have ſo unjuſtly
got. And 'twould be no difficult matter to prove
that they carried out of this Kingdom of <hi>Vencuela</hi>
above 3 Millions of Gold, having utterly ruined
the Country for 40 leagues together in the ſpace of
17 years; for ſo long they continued ſpoiling this
noble and fruitful Region. They have cheated
the King of above 2 Millions of his Revenues; nor
can they ever be able to repair the damage they
have done this delicious Country, unleſs the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thouſand People they have cruelly murder'd
could be rais'd again from the dead. What I am
now ſpeaking of, only reſpects the King's tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Intereſt, which they have ſo ill manag'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſaying any thing of their Blaſphemies, their
Impieties and Outrages committed immediately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Divine Majeſty. And who ſhall make
reparation for the loſs of ſo many Souls they have
precipitated into Hell, in not ſuffering the Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
to inſtruct 'em? Theſe are the Fruits of
their deteſtable avarice and profanity. As ſoon as
ever they enter'd this Kingdom, they ſeveral times
loaded divers Ships with great numbers of <hi>Indians,</hi>
whom they carried into the Iſle of <hi>St. Martha,</hi> and
ſold for Slaves. Great multitudes of theſe poor
Creatures were likewiſe carried into <hi>Hiſpaniola,
Jamaica,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>St. John,</hi> to the number at
leaſt of a million of Men. The Royal Council has
been ſufficiently inform'd of all theſe Diſorders and
Cruelties; but they are pleas'd to connive at 'em,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57864:50"/>
and are as willing to ſhut their Eyes, and take no
notice of all the Robberies and Villanies the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
have committed on the Coaſts of the Iſle of
<hi>St. Martha;</hi> tho they might have eaſily hinder'd all
this miſchief if they had applied themſelves to it.
'Twas the infamous Avarice of theſe Tyrants, that
induc'd 'em to take ſo many <hi>Indians</hi> to ſell 'em for
Slaves: and the very ſame covetous humour and
phrenzie has ſeiz'd all the Europeans that have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
ſet foot in <hi>America.</hi> Their Cuſtom has been
to take the poor <hi>Indians</hi> out of their houſes, with
their Wives and Children, to load 'em with Chains,
to mark 'em like Sheep that they might diſtinguiſh
'em one from another, and afterwards to ſell 'em as if
they had been born Slaves.</p>

they immediately began to caſt a Terror through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Country by I know not how many Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres;
ſo that the poor <hi>Indians</hi> who had never
known any thing like it, were put into a mighty
Conſternation. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> us'd 'em inſtead of
Beaſts of burden to carry their Arms, Utenſils and

expreſs'd abundance of Joy at their arrival, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
'em with the beſt they had, and furniſh'd 'em
with plenty of Proviſions as long as they continued
there; they offer'd 'em 600 of their ſtrongeſt men
to carry their Baggage, and look to their Horſes.
Yet the Spaniſh General was ſo little touch'd with
the courteſie of theſe People, that he kill'd their
Prince with a Lance, that ſo he might be in a better
condition to pillage them, who little thought of
ſuch a bloody fact as this, and other Cruelties with
which their barbarous Gueſts requited their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.
They with their Swords and Lances kill'd
all the Inhabitants of another Town, who ſtood
upon their Guard, and endeavour'd to defend
themſelves from the Hoſtilities of theſe Tyrants.
They put Men and Women, great and ſmall, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

reſpect either to Age, Sex or Quality. In another
Village a Spaniſh Captain kill'd above 200 <hi>Indians:</hi>
he cut off the Lips and Noſes of others, and ſent
'em away in this condition to terrify the reſt of the

On the Banks of the <hi>Silver-River</hi> they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
divers great Provinces and Kingdoms; and
cut the Throats of multitude of <hi>Indians,</hi> treating
'em with all the Cruelties they could invent: for

made 'em more barbarouſly cruel in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

their Actions have been reported to the Council of

all the Inhabitants, if they ſhould refuſe to

prompted by this Order, and ſupported by
the Authority of the Governor that ſent 'em, kill'd
5000 of theſe poor Creatures; who looking on
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as their declared Enemies, were not
willing to truſt 'em, or to have any commerce
with 'em; and therefore hid themſelves, not ſo
much to avoid giving 'em what they as'kd, as to
eſcape the points of their Swords. The other <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
were ſo terrified by this ſlaughter, that they
readily offer'd themſelves in great numbers to ſerve
the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Theſe <hi>Indians</hi> when they were one
day call'd by the Governour to receive ſome orders
from him, I know not by what hap, made ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
to preſent themſelves before him; upon which
he commanded 'em to be deliver'd up to another
Nation of <hi>Indians</hi> who were their mortal Enemies.
The poor Wretches as ſoon as they heard this cruel

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57864:52"/>
outright with their Swords and Lances, than to
abandon 'em to the rage of their ſworn Enemies.
Nor could they by any means be got out of the

hew'd 'em in pieces one after another; while the poor

                        <p>A Spaniſh Commander with a great number of
Soldiers enter'd theſe Kingdoms with the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of Governour; and with a Reſolution to heap
up a vaſt Treaſure in a little time. He had already
given ſome proofs of his skill and capacity on the
Continent; and he every day perfected himſelf
more and more in the Art of cutting of throats
and pillaging. He was naturally cruel, without
Faith, Honour or Religion; he knew no other
God than Gold or Silver, and therefore gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
liberty to commit all ſorts of Crimes, to get theſe
Metals any way in the world. He did abundance
of miſchief in the large Provinces of <hi>Peru.</hi> 'Tis
not poſſible to repreſent to the life what Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the Inhabitants of this rich Country underwent;
and what cruel ſorts of death they were made to

                        <p>When this Governour firſt enter'd <hi>Peru,</hi> he rifled
divers Villages, and took away prodigious quantities
of Gold. He then paſs'd into an Iſland (not far
from this Kingdom) which is very pleaſant, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and populous. The Prince of this Iſland, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Inhabitants, came out to meet the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
and received 'em with great joy and civility.
But in the ſpace of ſix months, which time the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
continued here, they conſum'd all the Corn and
other Proviſions they found in the Iſland. After this
they diſcover'd that the <hi>Indians</hi> had hid ſome Corn
under ground, to keep againſt a time of ſcarcity, for
the ſubſiſtence of their Wives and Children; which
they were conſtrain'd to leave to the diſcretion of the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> who took poſſeſſion of it as their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty;
and hereby reduc'd theſe poor People to the
utmoſt neceſſity. Soon after this they left the Iſland,
but firſt kill'd a great many of the People, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away the reſt with 'em for Slaves. Thus by the
many Cruelties they committed, this Iſland is quite
depopulated.</p>
                        <p>From hence they went into the Iſle of <hi>Tumbala,</hi>
which is ſituate near the Continent; here they maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred
all the Inhabitants that fell into their hands.
The reſt frighted at this cruel ſlaughter, fled every
way they could to avoid 'em; and tho they did this
only to ſave their Lives, it was interpreted a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
againſt the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> but was only an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice
of this Tyrant to entrap theſe miſerable Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that he might make 'em ſurrender to him all
the Gold and Silver they had: which they brought
to him in great quantities, while he ſtill demanded
greater, being reſolv'd to leave 'em nothing: And
when he had ſtrip'd 'em of all they had, he told
them he receiv'd 'em into the number of the King of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s Subjects, and pretended a great deal of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57864:53"/>
to 'em, promiſing he would treat 'em as his
friends, and not do 'em the leaſt hurt for the time

<hi>Indians,</hi> and terrifying 'em with menaces of the
King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s diſpleaſure; but had the Policy not
to receive 'em into the number of this Prince's Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals,
till he had robb'd 'em of all they had. And
yet the Title of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Subjects did
not ſecure 'em for the future from his Inſults and
Robberies.</p>
                        <p>The name of the Soveraign Prince and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of all theſe Kingdoms was <hi>Atabalipa,</hi> who
brought with him an innumerable Army of naked
men, who made uſe of a ridiculous ſort of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
not underſtanding the force of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
Swords and Lances, and Horſes, with which theſe
<hi>Indians</hi> had never been acquainted; he advanc'd his
Troops near the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> crying with a great deal
of courage, <hi>Where are theſe</hi> Spaniards? <hi>I'll never leave
'em till they have made me ſatisfaction for all my Subjects
that have been kill'd by them; of all my Towns which
they have burnt, and of all my Riches which they have
carried away.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> came to meet this
Prince in good order and well-arm'd, and made a
horrible ſlaughter among his Souldiers; they took
the King himſelf, who was carried on a ſtately Seat
upon the Shoulders of his Subjects. This Prince
finding himſelf in this miſerable Condition, began
to treat with 'em about his Ranſom, for which
he promiſed to give 'em 4 Millions of Crowns: for
this Sum they engag'd to give him his Liberty; yet
would not ſtand to their own Agreement, but
obliged him to aſſemble all his People, who to obey
their Prince's order came together in Crowds. This
King bore ſuch a ſway in the minds of his Subjects,
that he boaſted that the Leaves of the Trees in the
Woods durſt not move without his order. He told
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57864:53"/>
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> he was their Priſoner, and they had
now power to put him to death if they pleas'd.
Upon this they held a Council of War to deliberate
what to do with him; and reſolv'd to burn him
with a gentle Fire: only there was one Captain not
quite ſo inhuman as the reſt, who told 'em they
ought to content themſelves with ſtrangling him,
and then burning him after he was dead. When
the King was inform'd that he was condemn'd to
die, he thus expreſs'd himſelf; <hi>Why will ye needs put
me to death? What Crime have I committed againſt
you? Did you not promiſe to reſtore me my Liberty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
I would pay that Fine of Gold you impos'd on me?
Have not I given you a greater Sum than you demanded?
However if you are reſolv'd to kill me firſt ſend me at
leaſt to the King of</hi> Spain. But all his Complaints,
all his juſt Reproaches and Proteſtations could not
hinder them from burning him. 'Tis eaſy to ſee
that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had no right to make War with
this Prince and to treat him ſo inhumanly. But
the Captivity of this King, the Sentence of Death
pronounc'd againſt him, and the Cruelty with which
they put it in execution, after they had extorted
ſuch vaſt Treaſures from him, all ſufficiently diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Genius of theſe Tyrants, and of what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
and Violence they have been guilty both

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57864:54"/>
the manner of their treating the People of this new World.
Having been an Eye-witneſs, I have a certain knowledg
of the Diſpoſition and Manners of the Inhabitants of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru;</hi>
they are a meek, good-humour'd and peaceable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and have ſhewn a great deal of Affection and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> I have ſeen 'em give 'em great
Sums of Gold and Silver, and Pearls of a great value
very readily; they render'd 'em all the Services they could
require of 'em with all the diligence that could be reaſonably
deſir'd. They never offer'd to make War with 'em, nor
ſo much as to put themſelves in a poſture of Defence, till
they had receiv'd all imaginable Injuries from 'em, and
were thereby conſtrained to it contrary to their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
They gave the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as many Men and
Women as they needed for their Domeſtick Buſineſs;
and when they had receiv'd 'em into their Towns and
Villages with all the Honours they could think of, they
ſupplied 'em liberally with all the neceſſary Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Life.</p>
                              <p>I farther teſtify, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> without having
receiv'd the leaſt occaſion of Offence from the <hi>Indians,</hi>
ſeiz'd their great <hi>Cacique Atabalipa,</hi> ſoon after they
enter'd his Country, and burnt him after they had receiv'd
four Millions of Gold of him, and after having taken
immenſe Sums out of his Province without any Reſiſtance.
They inflicted the ſame Puniſhment on <hi>Cochilimaca</hi> his
Captain General, when he came to meet them in an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
manner with many other Noblemen of <hi>Peru.</hi> A
few days after another great Lord of the Province of
<hi>Quitonia</hi> ſuffer'd the ſame fate; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> burnt
him without having the leaſt occaſion given 'em for ſo
cruel an Action: With the like Barbarity and Injuſtice
they burnt <hi>Schapera</hi> the Prince of the <hi>Canaries.</hi> They
alſo burnt the feet of <hi>Aluis,</hi> the firſt and greateſt Lord
of the Province of <hi>Quitonia,</hi> and put him to a great
many other Torments to make him reveal K. <hi>Atabalipa</hi>'s
Treaſures, of which he was utterly ignorant, as it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57864:54"/>
appear'd by the ſequel. They condemn'd <hi>Coco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagaganga</hi>
to the ſame Puniſhment, who was Prince of
the Province of <hi>Quitonia:</hi> He ſuffer'd himſelf to be
over perſwaded by the Treaties of <hi>Sebaſtian Banalcaçar</hi>
a Spaniſh Captain, to come in an amicable manner and
ſurrender himſelf to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> this Captain having
given him his word that no Injury ſhould be done him; yet,
contrary to this promiſe, he was burnt alive, with ſeveral
<hi>Caciques</hi> beſides: and I have been inform'd, that the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> deſign'd to ſhew no Mercy to any <hi>Indian</hi> in
the Country.</p>
                              <p>I moreover affirm, that I my ſelf have ſeen the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
in ſeveral places cut off the Noſes, Ears and
Hands of Indian Men and Women, without any Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
in cold Blood (as it ſeem'd) purely for the ſake of
doing Miſchief, which is a moſt inexcuſable ſort of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity.
I have ſeen the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſet their fierce and
hungry Dogs at the <hi>Indians</hi> to tear 'em in pieces and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
'em. And I have ſeen 'em ſet fire to ſo many
Towns and Villages, that 'tis impoſſible I ſhould recollect
the number of 'em. 'Tis certain they have torn Children
from their Mothers Breaſts, and thrown 'em with all their
might as far as they could, to divert themſelves with this
brutiſh Sport. I have often been a Witneſs of many other
Cruelties of this nature, which have fill'd me with Dread
and Horror; but I ſhould be too prolix and tedious to give
the Detail of 'em.</p>
                              <p>I proteſt, that once the <hi>Spaniards</hi> when they had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
the greateſt number of <hi>Indians</hi> they could in three
great Houſes, ſet fire to 'em and burnt 'em all alive,
without any reaſon, having not receiv'd the leaſt affront
from 'em. And a certain Prieſt, whoſe name was <hi>Ocana,</hi>
happening to attempt to take a young Child out of the
Flames, a <hi>Spaniard</hi> that ſaw him, took the Child from
him, and immediately caſt it again into the Fire, where
it was burnt with the reſt. This <hi>Spaniard</hi> the ſame day
be committed this black and curſed Action, died ſuddenly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57864:55"/>
as he was going to the Camp; and I was of opinion that
his Carcaſe ought not to be interred.</p>
                              <p>I have ſeen the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſend Deputies to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciques</hi>
and chief <hi>Indians,</hi> to engage 'em to come and
meet 'em without fear, promiſing 'em to employ their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> on their behalf: but as ſoon
as they were come upon the Credit of the Promiſes that
had been given 'em, they were burnt without Pity or any
formal Proceſs. Two of the moſt illuſtrious and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Indians</hi> were burnt in my ſight, one at <hi>Andonia,</hi> and
the other at <hi>Tumbala.</hi> All the Efforts I made to ſecure
'em from the Flames, and to get 'em out of the hands of
theſe bloody Wretches, were to no purpoſe; my Diſcourſes
and Exhortations made no impreſſion on 'em. I can
ſay with a good Conſcience, and in the preſence of God,
that ſo far as I have been able to learn, by the long time
I have been among 'em, the Inhabitants of <hi>Peru</hi> have
never fomented any Mutiny or Rebellion, or done the leaſt
Injury to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who have treated them ſo inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly;
but whatever Torments they have ſuffer'd, they
ſeem'd to have laid aſide the thoughts of Revenge. And
when they found the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were always deceiving
'em, and breaking the Promiſes they made 'em; when they
found they treated 'em with ſo much Tyranny, contrary to
all Law and Equity; and that they did not ſcruple to
commit all ſorts of Outrages againſt 'em, they rather
choſe to die, than to be continually expos'd to ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries.</p>
                              <p>I have been inform'd by the Accounts the <hi>Indians</hi>
themſelves have given, that there is a great deal more
Gold among 'em undiſcover'd than has been yet found;
the ill <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage and Cruelty of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having made
'em conceal it: and they are reſolv'd never to diſcover it
while they are treated with ſo much Injuſtice and Tyranny,
but will rather die as their Companions have done, who
have been put to death with ſo much Cruelty. The Injuries
offer'd theſe poor <hi>Indians</hi> are very hainous Sins in the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57864:55"/>
ſight of God, and contrary to the Intereſt and Service of
the King, who has been cheated of more Treaſure in <hi>Peru</hi>
than would keep all the People in <hi>Caſtile.</hi>

                        <p>Thus far the Letter of that Monk, which was
confirm'd by the Atteſtation of the Biſhop of <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co:</hi>
He was an Eye-witneſs of what he here relates,
for he went through this Country for the ſpace of
fourſcore or a hundred Leagues, and continued there
nine or ten years, in a time when there were but
few <hi>Spaniards</hi> there. But as ſoon as it was reported
in <hi>Spain</hi> that this new World was ſo full of Gold,
there preſently came four or five thouſand People,
who ſpread themſelves through theſe noble Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
and poſſeſs'd five or ſix hundred Leagues of
the Country, which they entirely ruined, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all thoſe Diſorders and Crimes that have been
mention'd before. They have deſtroy'd a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more People here than this Frier takes notice of
in his Letter: and without having any fear of God
before their Eyes, or any regard to the King, or
the leaſt ſentiment of Compaſſion to their fellow-Creatures,
they have almoſt deſtroy'd one half of
Mankind; for in the Provinces of <hi>Peru</hi> alone they
have kill'd above forty Millions of People.</p>
                        <p>A few days after what I have related above, they
kill'd a great Queen with Arrows made of Reeds;
ſhe was Wife to Prince <hi>Elingue,</hi> who ſtill governs
this Province in quality of King: the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did
what they could to ſeize this Prince's Perſon, and
omitted no Tricks and Artifices to accompliſh it;
this was the occaſion of his Revolt againſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
and he has ever ſince continued their declar'd
Enemy. They took his Queen contrary to the Rules
of Equity and Juſtice; and 'tis ſaid they kill'd her
at a time when ſhe was big with Child, meerly to vex
and grieve the King her Husband, who lov'd her
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57864:56"/>
very tenderly. If all the Maſſacres the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
have committed in <hi>Peru</hi> ſhould be recounted, every
one would be aſtoniſh'd at the recital, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of 'em after an exact Computation would ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
all probability, and appear too great to be
believ'd.</p>

                        <p>A Great number of <hi>Spaniards</hi> went from <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çuela,</hi>
the Iſle of <hi>St. Martha,</hi> and <hi>Carthagena</hi>
in the year 1536, to make a Diſcovery of <hi>Peru:</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
others went up higher, three hundred Leagues
beyond <hi>St. Martha</hi> and <hi>Carthagena,</hi> to diſcover
thoſe excellent Countries that were very fertile, and
full of People of a mild and ſociable Temper;
where is abundance of Gold and precious Stones
found, eſpecially Emeralds: they gave this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
the name of <hi>New Grenada,</hi> becauſe the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that firſt ſet his foot in it was born at <hi>Grenada.</hi>
They that accompanied him were very profligate
Men, and extremely cruel; they ſhed human Blood
without any ſcruple or remorſe, for they had been
long accuſtom'd to all ſorts of Wickedneſs, and
therefore 'tis the leſs to be wonder'd at that they
have committed ſo many Crimes in this <hi>New Grenada,</hi>
where they abandon'd themſelves to all manner of
Abominations. I ſhall only mention ſome Inſtances
of 'em, becauſe an exact recital of their Cruelties
would fill the Minds of all that read this Hiſtory
with too much Horror.</p>
                        <p>A certain Governor that could not get his ſhare
of the Booty another had got before him in ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaging
this new Kingdom of <hi>Grenada</hi> at his pleaſure,
tho he could have ſeconded him with all his heart
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57864:56"/>
in the Cruelties and Robberies he committed here;
yet being enrag'd to ſee ſuch a valuable Prey eſcape
him, thought meet to appeaſe his Trouble after a
ſort, and to revenge himſelf on the other by making
authentick Informations confirm'd by the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Teſtimony of many Witneſſes, which expos'd
to light all the Vexations, Murders and Cruelties
which this Tyrant had been guilty of in <hi>New Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada.</hi>
The ſaid Informations were read in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of the <hi>Indies,</hi> where they have been hitherto pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
and are yet to be ſeen.</p>
                        <p>In theſe Informations the Witneſſes depoſe, that
this new Kingdom enjoy'd a ſettled Peace before the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> came thither; that the People ſhew'd 'em
all the kindneſs imaginable as ſoon as they came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
'em; that they maintain'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with
their Labour, and the Fruit of the Ground which
they manur'd; that they gave 'em prodigious quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of Gold, and abundance of precious Stones,
amongſt others a great many Emeralds; that they
freely brought 'em whatever was moſt valuable in
their Cities, the Government of which the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
divided among themſelves when they had can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton'd
'em into ſeveral parts: for this they counted a
proper method, the better to compaſs their deſign
of heaping together all the Gold they could poſſibly
find.</p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Indians</hi> were firſt ſubjugated to the
Tyranny of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the chief Captain, who
was General of the reſt, took poſſeſſion of the King's
Perſon as well as of the Country, and kept him
Priſoner for five or ſix Months, without any reaſon
in the World, demanding Gold and Emeralds of
him continually. This King, whoſe name was <hi>Bogata,</hi>
in the midſt of his fears, promis'd the Spaniſh Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
to deliver up all the Gold-plate he had, hoping
by this means to get out of the hands of this Tyrant:
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57864:57"/>
he ſent a great many <hi>Indians</hi> to his Houſe to fetch
theſe precious Goods; and at the ſeveral turns they
made he gave the <hi>Spaniard</hi> a great quantity of
Gold and Emeralds; who was not content with all
this, but threaten'd to kill him. Accordingly he
commanded this unfortunate King to be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him to receive his Sentence. This is the Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
theſe Tyrants give the moſt illuſtrious Perſons
of the new World: This haughty General pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
a fatal Sentence againſt this Prince, by
which he was condemn'd to moſt horrible Torments
if he did not immediately ſend for all the Gold he
had: Accordingly this Tyrant's Executioners laid
hold of the King, ſtretch'd him out at length upon
the ground naked, and pour'd boiling Roſin upon his
Belly; beſides this, they put his feet into a Fire, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
faſten'd his Neck to a Stake fix'd in the ground,
while two of theſe Hangmen held him by the Arms.
The cruel General came from time to time to look
upon him while this Torture continued, threatning
to take away his Life if he did not ſpeedily deliver
up his Gold. God ſeem'd by his Providence to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
his Diſpleaſure againſt theſe Cruelties, in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
the City where they were committed to be
conſum'd with Fire in a moment. The reſt of the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> took pattern by their General, and fill'd
up his ſteps: And having no other trade than that
of tormenting the <hi>Indians,</hi> and cutting 'em in pieces,
they practiſed the ſame Villanies in divers parts of
this Kingdom: They inflicted terrible Puniſhments
on ſeveral <hi>Caciques,</hi> and all their Subjects, who too
imprudently depended on the good words and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made 'em: And this after they
had given 'em incredible Sums of Gold, and many
Emeralds. Theſe Preſents, tho ſo valuable, could
not ſoften their obdurate Hearts, and render 'em
civil to their Benefactors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Tortures to which
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57864:57"/>
they put the <hi>Indians</hi> were to make 'em bring yet
more Gold and precious Stones; and the ſame motive
has induc'd 'em to burn all the great Lords of the
Country with a ſlow fire. A great multitude of
<hi>Indians</hi> one day came to meet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with a
great deal of humility and ſimplicity (as their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is) to offer 'em their ſervice, ſuppoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſafe; but while they were ſleeping without any
apprehenſion of danger, being faint and weary,
a Spaniſh Captain commanded his men to maſſacre
'em all, which was accordingly executed. This
was done to ſtrike the whole Country with terror
and conſternation, and to fright the Inhabitants
out of their Gold by the horror of ſo tragical a
Spectacle. The General made his Souldiers ſwear
how many <hi>Caciques</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> each of 'em had
kill'd, and how many they had reſerv'd alive for
their Slaves; theſe he immediately order'd 'em to
bring out into the moſt publick place of their City,
and made 'em there cut off the heads of 4 or 500
of theſe poor Creatures. Divers Witneſſes have
depos'd that this Captain order'd the hands and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of many <hi>Indians</hi> both Men and Women to be cut
off, and exercis'd other unheard of Cruelties among
'em. He ſent into <hi>Bogata</hi>'s Province to enquire who
had ſucceeded that Prince, whom he had ſo inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly
put to death: The Men he ſent to make this
Diſcovery took as many <hi>Indians</hi> as they could; ſuch
of 'em as could not tell the name of their late Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's
Succeſſor, were barbarouſly abus'd, ſome of 'em
had their Arms and Legs cut off; others were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to the fury of greedy Dogs, and ſoon torn in
pieces by 'em.</p>
                        <p>They fell upon a great number of Caciques and
Indian Noblemen by a treacherous ſurprize in the
middle of the Night, after they had aſſur'd 'em they
need not fear any affront or abuſe from them. The
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57864:58"/>
innocent <hi>Indians</hi> confiding in theſe fair promiſes,
were come down out of the Mountains where they
had hid themſelves, to lodg in the Cities, not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
the ill deſign the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had againſt 'em:
However theſe perfidious men ſurpriz'd 'em, and
cut off the Hands and Arms of all they took, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
'em know they were chaſtiz'd after this ſevere
manner for not telling the name of their late King's
Succeſſor. Another time the General ſent a great par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Soldiers into a City to make war with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
becauſe they ſent him not a basket of Gold
which he had demanded: they made theſe poor
people ſuffer a thouſand Outrages, and maſſacred vaſt
numbers of 'em. They inhumanly cut off the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and hands both of Men and Women, and gave
others to be devour'd by their Dogs, which were
wont to be fed with human fleſh.</p>
                        <p>The people of one of theſe Provinces, ſeeing
5 or 6 of their Chiefs burnt to death with a ſlow
fire, were frighted by this horrible ſight into the
mountains to ſhelter themſelves from the <hi>Spaniards;</hi>
they were about 5 or 6000: hereupon the Spaniſh
Commander ſent a Company of Soldiers to purſue
'em, and treat 'em as Rebels. 'Tis hard to imagine
by what right they aſſum'd an Authority to puniſh
people as rebels, that were free-born, and did not
in the leaſt depend on 'em. When the Spaniſh
Soldiers were got into this Mountain, they fell on
the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> who were naked and diſarm'd,
with a fury like that of Wolves and Lions, when they
ſet upon a flock of Sheep to devour 'em; till at
length they were ſo ſpent and fatigu'd meerly with
ſlaughtering theſe poor Creatures, that they were
forc'd to give over a while to take breath; after
which they renew'd this Maſſacre with more vigour.
And to cut ſhort their bloody work, they threw
down the greateſt part of theſe <hi>Indians</hi> headlong
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57864:58"/>
from the top of the Mountain, which was very high.
It has been depos'd by thoſe that were Eye-witneſſes
of this Tragedy, that they forc'd above 700 of theſe
poor <hi>Indians</hi> all together down this Precipice, ſo
that they look'd like a Cloud as they fell; they were
all daſh'd in pieces by this dreadful fall, and died
miſerably.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> puſh'd on this barbarous Expedition
to the utmoſt; for they made a diligent ſearch in
all the remote Corners of the Mountain, and gave
no quarter to any they found; thoſe they could catch
were either cut to pieces, or after many wounds caſt
down from the top of the Mountain. Nor did theſe
Cruelties ſatisfy 'em, but they ſhut up divers <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
both Men and Women, whom they had reſerv'd
for Slaves, in a houſe cover'd with ſtraw, which
they ſet on fire and ſo conſum'd 'em. They likewiſe
went to the City of <hi>Cola,</hi> where they took abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of People, with about 15 or 20 of their
Great Men; they expos'd theſe to the fury of their
Dogs, which devour'd 'em, having firſt cut off the
hands and feet both of Men and Women; and
fix'd theſe ſad Spoils on Poles, that they might be
obvious to the view of all, and that the dreadful
ſight might caſt terror and amazement in the minds
of all that ſurviv'd.</p>
                        <p>The Ravage and Cruelties theſe bloody-minded
Men exerciſed in this new Kingdom of <hi>Grenada</hi> are ſo
great, that if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> dos not apply a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
remedy, and ſet bounds to their exceſſive Avarice
and inſatiable thirſt of Gold, that whole Kingdom
will ſoon be deſtroy'd, and the Land lie unculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
and unimprov'd, for want of Inhabitants.</p>
                        <p>In the ſpace of 2 or 3 years, ſince this Kingdom
has been diſcover'd, they have without the fear of
God or Man put the Inhabitants to death, without
any emotion or pity to ſee ſo much human blood
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57864:59"/>
pour'd out. There are now ſcarce any People to
be found there after all theſe Maſſacres. There are
divers fine large Provinces near <hi>New Grenada;</hi> this
Country is called <hi>Popoyan</hi> and <hi>Cali,</hi> and is above
50 leagues in extent, which they alſo have ruined,
and made as deſolate as the former. Here they
have ſo ſlaughter'd the people, that this once po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
Country is now quite deſtitute of Inhabitants.
Thoſe that come from thence relate ſuch terrible
things of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> proceedings there, that one
can't hear their ſad Stories, without being pierc'd
with trouble and compaſſion in a very ſenſible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
In theſe Provinces they have ruin'd many fine
Cities from one end to t'other; ſo that they now
lie buried in their own Aſhes: there are ſcarce any
of the ruins of thoſe Cities to be ſeen, which once
contain'd above 2000 Houſes. In a word, this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
which was full of Villages, Towns, and Cities
for the ſpace of 50 leagues, is now ſo bare, that
there's ſcarce any token remaining to ſignifie there
ever were any ſuch buildings.</p>
                        <p>Some of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came from <hi>Peru</hi> into <hi>New
Grenada</hi> and <hi>Popoyan</hi> through the Province of <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia;</hi>
others of 'em came to <hi>Cali</hi> by the way of
<hi>Carthagena</hi> and <hi>Vraba,</hi> but all join'd together to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on the ſame deſign, ſpoiling a Country of 600
leagues in extent of all its Riches, and extirpating
all the Inhabitants after they had plunder'd 'em.
When this cruel War was ended, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took
ſome of the <hi>Indians,</hi> whom they had reſerved for
Slaves, into their ſervice, and caus'd the heads of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of their Companions to be cut off in their ſight
to terrify 'em; telling 'em they muſt all expect to
undergo the ſame fate, if they did not ſerve 'em
faithfully. By the recital of ſuch barbarous Actions
as theſe, the Reader may eaſily imagin how the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
behave themſelves towards the <hi>Indians</hi> in the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57864:59"/>
ſeveral parts of <hi>America.</hi> They feed their fierce
Dogs with human fleſh, on purpoſe to accuſtom 'em
to tear Men in pieces, and devour 'em. They car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
theſe Dogs with 'em wherever they go, and
barbarouſly murder the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> to feed theſe
ſavage Curs with their fleſh. They'l ſay one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Give me a quarter of that <hi>Indian</hi> to make my
Dog a feaſt; and when I kill one, I'll pay you again.
They commonly hunt in the morning with theſe
Dogs; and when ask'd by their fellows what luck
they have had, they anſwer according to their ſucceſs.
Sometimes one will ſay, I am content, my Dogs have
kill'd about a ſcore of 'em; ſo that one would think
they were ſpeaking of Wolves or wild Boars. Can
any thing be imagin'd that exceeds ſuch horrible
Cruelty as this? And all theſe Barbarities have been
prov'd and averred by ſtrict Examinations made and
produc'd before the Council of the <hi>Indies.</hi>

information of their other Villanies, which may be

the <hi>Indians</hi> periſh without Baptiſm, or any
other Sacrament; and no one gives himſelf the
trouble to inſtruct 'em; as will farther appear by
an authentick Letter from a Biſhop of this Country,
who expreſſes himſelf in theſe Terms:</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter">
                        <body>
                           <p>I Frier <hi>Bartholomew de Las-Caſas,</hi> Monk of the
Order of <hi>St. Dominique,</hi> having ſignified my deſire to
be recall'd from the <hi>Indies,</hi> had leave to come over to
the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> to give an account of the deplorable
Condition of the <hi>Indians.</hi> To this I have been mov'd
by the Zeal with which God has inſpir'd me for Souls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd
by his Blood. My earneſt deſire is, that they
may know their Creator, and embrace his Word, that
they may be ſav'd. And I cannot chooſe but extremely
pity <hi>Spain,</hi> my native Country, becauſe I am greatly
afraid God will utterly deſtroy it, for the enormous
Crimes committed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (who go into the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies)</hi>
both againſt God, againſt the King, and againſt
their Neighbours. I don't doubt but divers illuſtrious
Perſons of this Court, who are truly zealous for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Souls, are very ſenſibly touch'd with the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and Miſeries thoſe multitudes of poor Creatures
ſuffer in the New World, who are abandon'd to the fury
of the Spaniſh Souldiers. I reſolv'd long ago to draw up
an exact relation of theſe matters, but have been ſtill
hinder'd by the continual urgency of thoſe affairs in which
I have been engag'd till now. However I have at length
accompliſh'd this deſign at <hi>Valence,</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Anno</hi> 1542. This Treatiſe gives a ſhort account
of the Violence, Tyranny, Perſecutions, Robberies, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres
and Devaſtations committed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in
all the parts of <hi>America</hi> where they have diſpers'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57864:60"/>
Theſe Calamities and Diſorders are advanc'd to
a degree that ſurpaſſes all belief, and is the more ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are much leſs furious and cruel
every where elſe. Indeed the People of <hi>Mexico</hi> and of the
places adjacent, are now treated much better than others;
inſomuch that no body there dares offer violence to any
<hi>Indian</hi> openly: 'Tis true they exact immenſe Sums of
'em, but the forms of Juſtice are at leaſt ſo obſerv'd,
that the People are protected from the Inſults and Affronts
of ſuch as have more power than themſelves. I have
great hope our Illuſtrious Lord, <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who begins to take cognizance
of the Tyranny and ill behaviour of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> toward
the <hi>Indians,</hi> will undertake the protection of theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
People, who are perſecuted againſt his will, as well
as againſt the will of God. All the miſeries that have
bin inflicted on theſe newly diſcover'd Nations have bin hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
conceal'd from our Prince with no leſs ſubtilty and
addreſs than malice. Yet now 'tis not to be doubted but
this wiſe Emperor, into whoſe hands God has caſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of thoſe vaſt Regions, and who bears ſo ſincere
an affection to Juſtice, will give effectual Orders to put
a ſtop to theſe Perſecutions. May God preſerve this Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
Emperor in all the Glory and Proſperity that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
him, for the Salvation of his Soul, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the Church. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>A year after the writing of all of theſe matters
above recited, there were publiſhed in the City of
<hi>Madera</hi> certain Laws and Conſtitutions made by his
Majeſty at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> in the month of <hi>December</hi> in the
year 1542. which were calculated according to the
urgent neceſſity of Affairs to rectify the Diſorders
that were then commited with ſo much Inſolence both
againſt God and Man, to the utter deſtruction and
deſolation of the New World. For the conſtituting
of theſe wiſe Laws his Majeſty aſſembled a great
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57864:61"/>
many Perſons, illuſtrious both for their Quality and
Learning, and moreover endued with great Piety,
who deliberated on theſe important Affairs in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Seſſions at <hi>Valladolid.</hi> At length by the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Conſent of the whole Aſſembly, divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
were ratified and publiſh'd; and which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
the more conformable to the Rules of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
in as much as the Perſons who compos'd this
famous Aſſembly had never been any way concern'd
in the Outrages offer'd the <hi>Indians;</hi> they were ſuch
as had neither waſh'd their hands in their Blood,
nor reap'd any advantage by the immenſe Treaſures
that had been taken from 'em with ſo much Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
after the murder of incredible numbers
of innocent People. For the Avarice and Cruelty
of thoſe <hi>Spaniards</hi> who firſt ſet foot in <hi>America</hi> have
been the fatal Cauſes of all the Miſeries that new
World has undergon.</p>
                     <p>After the publication of theſe new Orders for
regulating the Affairs of the <hi>Indies,</hi> the Protectors
of thoſe cruel Tyrants, who had ſtill ſome Credit
at Court, procur'd ſeveral Precepts to conſtitute
Officers to ſend into divers Provinces of the <hi>Indies,</hi>
for they were much concern'd to ſee the courſe of
their Violence likely to be ſtop'd, and their wonted
Robberies and Extortions obſtructed. And thus
they to whom the care of ſuppreſſing theſe Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and preventing the farther Inſults of theſe
Tyrants was committed, made no conſcience of
violating that Equity and Fidelity they ow'd both to
God and their Prince; for they knew very well
what effect the Edicts that were made muſt needs
have, and therefore alarm'd the People before the
arrival of the Judges who were ſent to the <hi>Indies</hi>
to publiſh the Laws of their Prince, and to put 'em
in execution: ſo that as ſoon as theſe Judges came
into <hi>America,</hi> they appear'd to be of the ſame ſtamp
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57864:61"/>
with thoſe that ſent 'em, and neither regarded God
nor Man; they immediately forgot the King's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and laid aſide the Reverence due to ſo great
a Prince; and being willing to take part with thoſe
Tyrants, that they might have a ſhare of the Booty,
behav'd themſelves with a Cruelty beyond imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and juſtified thoſe Villanies which they were
ſent to puniſh.</p>
                     <p>So that ſince the year 1542, ſuch Rapine and
Violence has been committed in <hi>Peru,</hi> that the like
has not been heard of either in the <hi>Indies,</hi> or any
other part of the World: Nor do they exerciſe
their Cruelty only on the <hi>Indians,</hi> whom they have
almoſt exterminated, but are ſuffer'd by the juſt
Judgment of God to turn their Arms one againſt
another with great fury to their mutual deſtruction.
Some of the People of this new World under the
protection of theſe Rebels, were encourag'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
Obedience to the Emperor's Orders; others
pretending they were deſirous to addreſs Petitions
to his Imperial Majeſty, have ſuffer'd themſelves to
be carried down the ſtream with the reſt, and have
revolted too. For the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are not eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to ſurrender thoſe Treaſures they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
uſurped, or to releaſe thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> whom
they have inſlav'd. If they don't ſo often maſſacre
'em, they increaſe the weight of their Irons, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Laws on 'em more and more unjuſt and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
And the King with all his Authority has not
yet been able to ſtop the courſe of theſe Miſchiefs,
becauſe they are generally link'd together in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy,
both ſmall and great; and all uſe the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious
trade of robbing and ſpoiling more or leſs
according to their power, ſome more publickly,
and others after a clandeſtine manner. But that
which yet further diſcovers the Boldneſs and Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of theſe Hypocrites is, that they ſtill make
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57864:62"/>
pretences that they conſult nothing but the King's
Intereſt, and the Glory of God in all they do;
while 'tis moſt apparent, they are continually rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the King, and that with impunity, and are
always diſhonouring God and Religion by their cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
and ſcandalous Practices.</p>
                     <p>That which next follows is a Fragment of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                           <p>—The Captain order'd theſe <hi>Indians</hi> to
be chain'd for Slaves, which was preſently done,
and he carried away with him great numbers of
Men and Women in Chains; ſo that the whole
Country was ſoon turn'd into a Deſert. They
took away all the Crop of Corn theſe poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
had, and whatever elſe they had laid up for
the ſubſiſtence of their Families, by which means
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57864:62"/>
they were ſoon reduc'd to extreme want; ſo that
many were found dead in the High-ways merely
with Famine. There were alſo above ten thouſand
of thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took to carry their
Baggage, that died on the Coaſts: for almoſt all
that went any diſtance from the Sea were kill'd
with the exceſſive Heat they met with on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.
This ſame Captain following the ſteps of
<hi>John Ampudia,</hi> ſent before him two <hi>Indians</hi> whom
he had taken in the Province of <hi>Quitonia,</hi> to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Villages and Towns that were in their way,
and where any Booty was to be got; theſe <hi>Indians</hi>
were either his own Slaves, or thoſe of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
ſome of whom had two or three hundred
Slaves a Man, and others more or leſs, as they had
more or leſs Baggage and Proviſions to carry.
Theſe <hi>Indians</hi> return'd to their Maſter, together
with ſuch others as they could bring away with 'em.
And in theſe Expeditions all ſorts of Cruelties were
committed upon Women and Children. They did
the ſame in the Province of <hi>Quitonia,</hi> they fir'd
their Houſes wherever they came, and burnt all
the Stores of Corn the <hi>Indians</hi> had. And to ſhew
their ſpite the more, as if all this Miſchief had
been too little, they kill'd their Cattel only for
the Suet and Marrow, having no occaſion for the
Fleſh; only the <hi>Indians</hi> who attended the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
in theſe Expeditions ate the Livers, that being one
of their principal Diſhes. 'Tis ſcarce to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
what numbers of Cattel they kill'd here;
they deſtroy'd above a hundred thouſand after this
manner only for the Fat and Livers, and ſo made
the Country deſolate by this needleſs ſlaughter,
which brought ſuch a Famine and Miſery upon the
Inhabitants, that they died for want of Food:
They beſides carried away out of this Province all
the Corn they did not burn; ſo that tho the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57864:63"/>
produces abundance, there was ſo great a Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
that a<note n="*" place="bottom">A Septier is a meaſure of Corn containing about 240 pound weight.</note> Septier of Corn was worth ten
Crowns, and a Lamb was ſold for the ſame Price.</p>
                           <p>The Commander of theſe Troops being return'd
from the Sea-Coaſt, reſolv'd to leave the Province
of <hi>Quitonia,</hi> and to join <hi>John Ampudia.</hi> To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
this Deſign he raiſed above two hundred
Men Horſe and Foot, among which were divers
Citizens of <hi>Quitonia.</hi> He gave 'em leave to bring
with them the <hi>Caciques,</hi> and all the other <hi>Indians</hi>
which had formerly fallen to their ſhare, and to
add as many others to 'em as they pleas'd, which
they did. One <hi>Alphonſo Sanchez</hi> carried with him
his <hi>Cacique,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Nenuyta,</hi> with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
other <hi>Indians</hi> and their Wives. <hi>Peter Cobo</hi>
accompanied him with a hundred and fifty <hi>Indians</hi>
and their Wives, who were forc'd to drag their
Children after 'em, for fear they ſhould periſh with
Hunger. One <hi>Moran,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Popayan</hi> carried
above two hundred People with him; and all the
reſt of the Souldiers did the ſame proportionably
to their Stock and Occaſions. They deſir'd permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to make all the Indian Men and Women that
attended 'em their abſolute Slaves, which was
granted; and this Privilege continued as long as
they liv'd, tho theſe <hi>Indians</hi> were the Subjects and
Vaſſals of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> as well as the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
themſelves.</p>
                           <p>With ſuch an Equipage as this our General left
the City of <hi>Quitonia,</hi> to go take poſſeſſion of that
of <hi>Octaba,</hi> which fell to his lot. He demanded of
the <hi>Cacique</hi> five hundred Men to join his Forces,
which were deliver'd to him, with divers other
Perſons of Note. Part of theſe <hi>Indians</hi> he diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57864:63"/>
among his Souldiers, and took the reſt to
himſelf, ſome of whom were loaded with Chains,
and others with his Baggage and Proviſions. 'Twas
a lamentable ſight to ſee theſe poor Wretches tied
one to another with Cords. When theſe <hi>Spaniards</hi>
parted from the Province of <hi>Quitonia,</hi> they carried
away no leſs than ſix thouſand <hi>Indians,</hi> of which
ſcarce twenty came back to their own Country;
for the extreme Fatigues and ſcorching Heat they
endur'd in thoſe hot Countries ſoon cut 'em off.</p>
                           <p>The General having made <hi>Alphonſo Sanchez</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of a Company, this Brute meeting ſome
Women and Children in his way, loaded with
Proviſions, and waiting for him to preſent him
with what they had brought, maſſacred 'em all
without pity. In this cruel Action, a <hi>Spaniard</hi>
going about to kill an Indian Woman broke his
Sword in two the firſt blow he gave her; at the
ſecond ſtroke he broke it again, ſo that he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Hilt left in his hand: but that which
is more ſurprizing is, that this poor Woman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
no Wound by the blows he gave her. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Souldier ſtriking an Indian Woman with a
large Dagger, had about three Inches of it broken
off at the firſt ſtroke, and the whole Blade quite
to the Hilt at the ſecond.</p>
                           <p>When this General, of whom we have been
ſpeaking, parted from <hi>Quitonia,</hi> he cruelly ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Husbands and Wives one from another,
giving the young Women to the <hi>Indians</hi> that went
with him, and leaving the old Women to thoſe
that remain'd in the City. One of theſe Women
follow'd him with loud Cries when he went away,
and beg'd of him with abundance of Tears, that
he would not take away her Husband from her,
telling him ſhe had the charge of three Children,
and 'twould be impoſſible for her to provide for
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57864:64"/>
'em if ſhe were bereav'd of her Husband; ſo that
they muſt neceſſarily be ſtarv'd. The General re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd
her not without ſome Indignation, upon
which ſhe redoubled her Sighs and Cries, telling
him her Children were ready to die with Hunger:
at length ſeeing her Prayers and Tears made no
Impreſſion on him, ſhe took a Stone and daſh'd out
the Brains of all her Children in his ſight.</p>
                           <p>When this Commander arriv'd in the City of
<hi>Palo,</hi> which is ſituate in the Province of <hi>Lilia,</hi> he
met with Captain <hi>John Ampudia,</hi> who went before
him to make a diſcovery of the Country, and to
ſettle Peace in it: he was now Governor of this
City, which had a Gariſon in the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s
Name, and was under the direction of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<hi>Francis de Piccaro,</hi> who had eſtabliſh'd a
Council there conſiſting of eight Counſellors, that
had the Inſpection of the whole Country, and kept
it in Peace and Union by the good management of
<hi>Peter Solano de Quenon. Ampudia</hi> hearing our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
was arriv'd in the Country, came to give him
a Viſit, accompanied with many of the Inhabitants
and <hi>Indians,</hi> who brought him abundance of Fruit,
and other Proviſions. Many of the neighbouring
<hi>Indians</hi> came afterwards on the ſame Errand, and
after them the Inhabitants of <hi>Xamundia, Palonia, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limania</hi>
and <hi>Bolonia,</hi> did the like. But becauſe they
did not bring ſo great a quantity of Corn as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
the General ſent a Troop of Souldiers
with a great many <hi>Indians</hi> to ſeek ſome elſewhere,
with Orders to take it where ever they found it.
With this Order they went into <hi>Palonia</hi> and <hi>Bolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
where they found the <hi>Indians</hi> dwelling very
peaceably in their Houſes; and without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the Laws of Nations or of Hoſpitality,
took away all the Corn and other Proviſions, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with all the Gold and Silver they had, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57864:64"/>
put many of the poor <hi>Indians</hi> in Chains to make
Slaves of 'em. Theſe unhappy People came to
make their Complaint to the General of the ill
Treatment and Injuſtice they had ſuffer'd, and to
intreat him to cauſe Reſtitution to be made of
what had been ſo violently taken from 'em, but in
vain, for he would do nothing in the matter, only
gave 'em his promiſe that his Men ſhould do 'em no
hurt for the future, and that they ſhould never come
again into their Country: yet four or five days
after they went into another part of the Country
for Corn, and pillag'd the poor <hi>Indians</hi> as they had
done before; who were ſo provok'd to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
deluded by the General, who had broke his
Promiſes almoſt as ſoon as he had made 'em, that
the whole Country betook themſelves to their
Arms in an inſtant; which Tumult afterwards oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd
many Diſorders and great Offences to be
commited both againſt the Majeſty of God and
the Dignity of the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> At length theſe
People fled, and left this whole Country deſolate.
They that retreated into the Mountains came down
from time to time to ſeek Proviſion; the <hi>Indians</hi>
likewiſe engag'd in a cruel War one with another,
wherein the ſtronger party us'd to eat the weaker:
For that Indian Nation that inhabits the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
are a fierce and warlike People, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Enemies to their Neighbours. After this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
the General went to the City of <hi>Ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
where he receiv'd all the Honours due to his
Character; he afterwards march'd with two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Horſe and Foot toward <hi>Lilia</hi> and <hi>Pelinia.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>He ſent his Captains all round the Country to
make a cruel War upon the <hi>Indians;</hi> they fir'd a
great many Houſes, robb'd all that fell into their
hands, and kill'd abundance of 'em. This killing
and pillaging continued many days together. The
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57864:65"/>
Lord of the Country hoped to put a ſtop to theſe
Miſeries, and to allay the bloody Rage of theſe Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
by ſending their Subjects to 'em with all ſorts
of Proviſions and other Preſents. Soon after this
they came to <hi>Lilia</hi> with all the <hi>Indians</hi> they had
taken, for they would not diſcharge one of 'em.
They paſs'd through <hi>Ycea</hi> in their way, and were
no ſooner arriv'd there, but they fell to pillaging
and maſſacring all they met with; they exercis'd
their uſual trade of firing their Houſes, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
above a hundred of 'em in one Village; nor
did other Towns and Cities in the neighbouring
Country, which they call <hi>Tulilicui,</hi> fare any better.
When the <hi>Cacique</hi> at the head of a great company
of <hi>Indians</hi> came to meet 'em, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
demanded Gold of him and his Subjects:
they told him they had no great quantity, but
would readily give him all they had; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
brought him that little they had got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Upon which he deliver'd a kind of Receipt
ſign'd with his own hand to each of 'em, which was
to ſerve for a token by which to diſtinguiſh thoſe
that had given him Gold from the reſt; adding,
that whoever had not this Receipt ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to the Dogs to the devour'd by 'em. The
poor Creatures terrified by theſe Menaces, brought
him all the Gold they had in very great haſte, and
thoſe that had none were fain to retire into the
Mountains, or into other Cities to ſave their Lives;
and thus the Country was depriv'd of the greateſt
part of its Inhabitants. A little after he order'd
the <hi>Cacique</hi> to ſend two <hi>Indians</hi> to the City of
<hi>Agua,</hi> to ſignify that he requir'd the Inhabitants to
meet him, which they might do with ſafety, and
to bring with them all the Gold they could. After
he had diſpatch'd this Order, he went to another
City, and the ſame might ſent a party of <hi>Spaniards</hi>
                              <pb n="111" facs="tcp:57864:65"/>
to ſeize ſome of the People of <hi>Tulilicui,</hi> who
brought him a hundred Men and Women the day
following, of which he reſerv'd the moſt robuſt
and luſty, whom he thought fit to carry great Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
for himſelf and his Souldiers, and put many
of 'em in Chains, giving the young Children to
the <hi>Cacique</hi> of <hi>Tulilicui</hi> to eat, in whoſe Houſe their
Skins fill'd with Aſhes are ſtill to be ſeen. After
this Expedition he went toward the Provinces of
<hi>Calili,</hi> where he join'd Captain <hi>John d' Ampudia,</hi>
who was gone another way to make a further
diſcovery. Theſe two Commanders left great
marks of their Cruelty in all the Provinces through
which they paſs'd. <hi>Ampudia</hi> happen'd to come
to a certain City, the Governor of which, whoſe
name was <hi>Bitacon,</hi> had made deep works under
ground to hinder the approach of an Enemy:
Two of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Horſes, that of one <hi>Antony
Redondon,</hi> and that of <hi>Marc Marqués,</hi> fell into theſe
Traps, and the latter of 'em dy'd with the fall,
but the other eſcap'd the danger. However this
ſmall loſs by the Stratagem of the <hi>Indians</hi> ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
this Captain, that he order'd his Men to
take all of 'em they could light on, which was
about three hundred, and to caſt 'em into theſe
Pits; beſides this they fir'd a hundred Houſes.
From hence they came to a very great and populous
City, here they had no Interpreter by whom to
converſe with theſe <hi>Indians;</hi> however they maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
abundance of 'em with their Swords and
Lances. As ſoon as theſe two Commanders met
one another again after all theſe Expeditions, <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudia</hi>
gave the other a relation of what he did at
<hi>Bitaconia,</hi> and told him how many <hi>Indians</hi> he had
caſt into the Pits that were made at the entrance
of the City, while the other applauded all he had
done, telling him he had reaſon to ſerve 'em after
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57864:66"/>
that manner: And added, that for his part he had
deſtroy'd above two hundred <hi>Indians</hi> near the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Bamba,</hi> which waters the Province of <hi>Quito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
Thus theſe two Tyrants made War upon all
this Country at the ſame time. They both after
this enter'd into the Provinces of <hi>Birumia</hi> and
<hi>Anzerma,</hi> where they left everlaſting tokens of
their Barbarity and Fury. One <hi>Francis Garcia,</hi>
whom they ſent out to pillage the Country, treated
the People with abundance of Inſolence, till he
reduc'd 'em to extreme Indigence and Miſery.
The <hi>Indians</hi> came to him by couples, making
ſigns to deſire Peace for the whole Country, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
to give the <hi>Spaniards</hi> all they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and to deliver up their Gold, and their
Wives too, provided they would give 'em their
Lives; but receiv'd no other Anſwer from this
cruel <hi>Garcia,</hi> but that they muſt be gone, for he
had drank too much, and was now in no condition
to conſider of what they ſaid. He enter'd their
Country full of Fury, and running through the
whole Province, put it all under Military Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
robbing, and ſpoiling, and maſſacring the
Inhabitants without mercy: he carried away
two thouſand of the People with him, who were
put in Chains, and dy'd under the rigor of their
cruel Bondage: And before he left this Country
he put fifty more to a violent Death.</p>
                           <p>After he had fill'd this Province with miſery
and horror, he paſſed into the Province of <hi>Calili.</hi>
When any of the <hi>Indians</hi> that carried his Baggage
fainted with wearineſs, and fell under their Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
in the way, they kill'd 'em on the ſpot, to
terrify the reſt by theſe bloody Actions, that none
of 'em might dare to pretend themſelves ſick to
get rid of their Burdens and Labours. And thus
they were all deſtroy'd by degrees; for partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57864:66"/>
they were not ſufficiently look'd after, and
partly becauſe unreaſonable Labour was exacted of
'em, there was not ſo much as one of all thoſe <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
left alive, which they brought from <hi>Quitonia,
Paſtonia, Quilla, Cangapatra, Popaya, Lilia, Calicia,</hi>
and <hi>Anzerma.</hi> As the <hi>Spaniards</hi> return'd, they
paſt through a great City, where they put moſt
of the Inhabitants to the Sword, and carried away
300 Priſoners, whom they inſlav'd according to
their uſual manner.</p>
                           <p>The General ſent <hi>John Ampudia,</hi> when they
were in the Province of <hi>Lilia,</hi> with a conſiderable
Party of Soldiers into thoſe parts of the Country
moſt inhabited, to take as many <hi>Indians</hi> as he could
to carry the Baggage; becauſe not one of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
they brought from <hi>Anzerma</hi> and <hi>Allia,</hi> which
amounted to about 1000 Men, was able to endure
the Fatigue, but all died in the way. They here
took as many as they had occaſion for to carry their
Baggage, and the reſt were left to the diſcretion
of the Soldiers, who put 'em in Chains, and kept
'em till they were ſtarv'd; ſo that this Country
was quite unpeopled, neither <hi>Spaniards</hi> nor <hi>Indians</hi>
being now to be found in it. After all theſe Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages,
they advanc'd toward <hi>Popaya,</hi> leaving
<hi>Martin d' Aquirra</hi> by the way, he being unable to
follow the reſt. As ſoon as they arriv'd at <hi>Popaya;</hi>
they form'd a Gariſon in the City, and treated the
Inhabitants with the ſame Inſolence and Violence
they had us'd in all other parts of the Country where
they had made their Progreſs. Here they coined
Money with the King's Image and Arms upon it;
they ſtamp'd all the Gold they had, as well as
that which <hi>John d' Ampudia</hi> had got by his Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries,
after this manner. All this Gold was
melted by the General's Order, without keeping
any Account of it, or paying any of the Soldiers,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57864:67"/>
unleſs it were ſuch as had loſt their Horſes; ſo
that he kept almoſt all the Gold for his own private
uſe. He pretended indeed to take the 5<hi>th</hi> part of
it, which is the King's due, and to go to <hi>Cuzco</hi> to
give an Account of it to his Majeſty's Intendent;
but took another way, and return'd into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Quitonia,</hi> taking up many <hi>Indians</hi> as he went,
who all died under the heavy Yoke of their ſlavery.
He afterwards effac'd the King's Image, which he
had ſtamp'd upon this new Money. And 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
concerning this Man, that he could not
but reflect on all the miſchief he had done, and on
the Cruelties he had committed; for he was wont
to ſay of himſelf, Whoever ſhall come into theſe
Provinces 50 years hence, and be told what kind
of life I led here, will ſay, <hi>Such a Tyrant went this
way, and here are everlaſting marks of his Violence
and Cruelty.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It is not to be conceal'd from <hi>Your Highneſs,</hi> that
the reſt of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> who came into the <hi>Indies</hi>
after him, have endeavour'd to tread in his ſteps,
and have exactly follow'd the Example he ſet 'em;
for they have committed the ſame Injuſtice and
Villany and ſo they ſtill continue to do.</p>

                           <p>The moſt proper and beſt Expedient, and which is
of great importance for your Majeſty's Intereſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which all others will be fruitleſs, is, that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
ſend expreſs Orders to all your Courts and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals
in the <hi>Indies,</hi> to receive all the <hi>Indians,</hi> both
thoſe that have been already ſubjugated, and thoſe
that ſhall be conquer'd for time to come, into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of your free Subjects, that all the Provinces they
inhabit be united to the Kingdoms of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and
<hi>Leon,</hi> and that all the Inhabitants be incorporated
as your own People, ſo that they ſhall not be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being inſlaved by any <hi>Spaniard;</hi> and that this
Law and Order be inviolably obſerv'd: that for the
future theſe new Provinces may not be diſmember'd
and alienated from the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> under any
pretext whatſoever, tho never ſo great neceſſity
ſhould be pretended; and never ſo preſſing inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
be made with your Majeſty to obtain the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of a particular Soveraignty for any one: That
all the world may know that the Government
of thoſe Provinces that are ſubdued in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
is inſeparably united to your Majeſty's Crown,
and a part of your Property. That to confirm this
Conſtitution the better, and to render it the more
ſolemn and inviolable, your Majeſty would pleaſe to
take an Oath upon the Holy Goſpel, on your Crown,
and all that is moſt ſacred, in the form and manner
Princes are wont to do on ſuch Occaſions, that you
will never revoke this Edict; and that your Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57864:68"/>
be oblig'd to take the ſame Oath: And that your
Majeſty take care to make it one expreſs Article of
your laſt Will and Teſtament to engage your Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
to obſerve this Law, and to make others ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it, as much as lies in their Power.</p>
                           <p>Divers reaſons are afterwards produc'd to ſhew
that this Policy is of abſolute neceſſity for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of <hi>America,</hi> and to hinder the utter Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of the <hi>Indians.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The inſatiable Covetouſneſs of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who
mind nothing but to amaſs together heaps of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
makes 'em unwilling to ſuffer any Prieſt or
Monk to come into thoſe Cities where they are
Maſters, for fear their worldly Intereſt ſhould receive
conſiderable damage by that ſort of Men; becauſe
(they ſay) it makes the <hi>Indians</hi> idle, to aſſemble 'em
(as they do) to inſtruct 'em in the matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
for all the time they take up to preach to 'em,
they detain 'em from the Work impoſed on 'em.
Sometimes when the poor <hi>Indians</hi> have been aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for their inſtruction in Chriſtianity, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
have inſolently accoſted 'em with Cudgels in
their hands; taking ſuch a number of 'em as they
think fit, to carry their Baggage or any ſuch like Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
and if they are unwilling to obey, they force
'em to it with Blows in the ſight of all the reſt,
and in the preſence of the Monks that inſtruct 'em;
which is a great Scandal to our Religion, and a
mighty Obſtacle to their Converſion, who are
ſtrangely terrified and hinder'd in theſe pious Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
as well as the Monks that preach to 'em, by
this ill uſage.</p>
                           <p>Another Inconvenience the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pretend they
receive from theſe Inſtructions, is, that when the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
are converted and plac'd in the number of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
they grow proud and inſolent, thinking bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of themſelves than they are, and refuſe to work ſo
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57864:68"/>
hard as they did before. For the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are very
ambitious to command the <hi>Indians</hi> as their abſolute
Slaves, and to be obey'd, reſpected, and even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd
by 'em; and therefore omit nothing that may
hinder them from becoming Chriſtians.</p>
                           <p>Sometimes 3 or 4 Towns or Villages are given
up to the diſpoſal of a certain number of <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
and the Inhabitants diſtributed among 'em, to ſome
more, to others fewer; and it often happens that
a Woman falls to one Man's ſhare, whoſe Husband
falls to the Lot of another, and their Children to
a third; ſo that they divide theſe miſerable Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
like Flocks of Sheep. They employ 'em in all
ſorts of ſervice, as to manure the ground, to work
in the Mines, and to carry Burdens in Journeys of
50 or 60 Leagues. And their Maſters ſo conſtantly
exact the hard Tasks of Work they ſet 'em, that the
poor Wretches have not time to attend the Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Divine Word, and to learn the Rules of
Chriſtianity. Theſe People, tho free, have been
made Slaves, and the greateſt part of 'em deſtroy'd.
Parents and Children have been ſlaughter'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
Villages and Cities entirely ruin'd, and not
a Houſe left ſtanding. And the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have no
more regard to their Salvation, than if their Souls
and Bodies died together, and were uncapable of
eternal Rewards or Puniſhments.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> undoubtedly have an Obligation of
Duty upon 'em to inſtruct them in the Doctrine of
Chriſt; but they are ſo ignorant themſelves, that
'tis not much to be wonder'd at, if they take no care
to inform others. I knew one <hi>John Colmenero</hi> in the
Iſle of <hi>St. Martha,</hi> as dull, as ignorant and whimſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
a fellow as one ſhould meet with, to whom the
care of inſtructing the <hi>Indians</hi> in a great City was
committed, tho he ſcarce knew how to make the
ſign of the Croſs; and when he was examined about
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57864:69"/>
the courſe he took to inſtruct the <hi>Indians,</hi> could
make no other anſwer, but that he taught 'em to ſay,
<hi>Per ſignin ſanctin Cruces.</hi> By which one may eaſily
gueſs at the profound Underſtanding of the Man.
And how indeed is it poſſible for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to
teach the <hi>Indians</hi> Chriſtianity, and to inform 'em
what is neceſſary to Salvation, when the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Spaniſh Lords, and ſuch as make the greateſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
in the <hi>Indies,</hi> ſcarce know how many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
there are? For they go into <hi>America</hi>
only to gratify their inſatiable Covetouſneſs. They
are generally given to all ſorts of Vices; and ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt,
voluptuous and effeminate, that if a juſt
Compariſon were made between them and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
theſe latter would be found to have much
more Virtue and Honeſty: For as ignorant and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
as they be, they are content with one Wife
according to the Laws of Nature, as a neceſſary help
to 'em; whereas the <hi>Spaniards</hi> lay aſide all reſpect to
the will of their Maker, and take 14 or 15 Women,
or as many as they pleaſe, to ſatisfy their brutiſh
Paſſions, how oppoſite ſoever this Plurality of Wives
is to the Law of God. The <hi>Indians</hi> ſcarce know what
it is to take away one another's Goods, and live in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently
by their Neighbours, without offering 'em
any Violence or Oppreſſion. And what thoughts
muſt ſuch People as theſe have of thoſe that call
themſelves Chriſtians, when they ſee 'em commit
all manner of Crimes and Villanies; when they
ſee 'em guilty of ſo much Injuſtice and Treachery,
and in a word, of all the Abominations of which
men that are left of God, and have no principle of
honour or conſcience can be capable? This makes
many <hi>Indians</hi> laugh at the God we worſhip, and
perſiſt obſtinately in their Incredulity. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the God of the Chriſtians to be the worſt of
Gods, becauſe his Worſhippers are the worſt of
Men.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="119" facs="tcp:57864:69"/>
As for your Majeſty, they think you are the moſt
cruel and impious Prince in the World, while they
ſee the Cruelty and Impiety your Subjects ſo inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
commit; and they verily believe your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
lives upon nothing but human fleſh and blood.
Probably this account may very much ſurprize your
Majeſty, who perhaps have not yet receiv'd ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
information about theſe matters; but this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is of long ſtanding, and become inveterate
among 'em. I could produce a great many Inſtances,
of which I have been an Eye-witneſs, to convince
you of the Truth of it; but I am afraid of making
your Majeſty too uneaſy, and of filling the Reader's
mind with too much horror, by reciting ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
and unparallel'd Stories, which may give
a juſt occaſion of Wonder, that God has ſo long
defer'd to inflict ſome exemplary and terrible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon <hi>Spain,</hi> to puniſh all the Abominations
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have committed in the <hi>Indies.</hi> The
Pretence of ſubjecting the <hi>Indians</hi> to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Spain,</hi> is only made to carry on the deſign
of ſubjugating 'em to the Dominion of private Men,
who make 'em all their Slaves. One <hi>Spaniards</hi> who
has the Government of a Town or City, does more
miſchief by his vitious and ſcandalous Example,
than a hundred Prieſts and Monks can do good in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to advance Chriſtianity by all their
Piety, and the exemplary Sanctity of their Lives.</p>
                           <p>When the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have the Government of any
place committed to 'em, or have any perſonal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
or ſpecial intereſt in it, they'l be ſure to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
and haraſs the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> and offer 'em all
the Abuſes that can be. And 'tis now become almoſt
impoſſible for your Majeſty or your Miniſters to ſtop
the Courſe of theſe Oppreſſions, and regulate theſe
Diſorders; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> terrify the <hi>Indians</hi> by
their threatnings, and ſometimes kill 'em to prevent
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57864:70"/>
their complaints againſt 'em: and of this kind of
Cruelty we have many Inſtances: So that the poor
<hi>Indians</hi> are continually moleſted and haraſſed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any calm Intervals in which to compoſe their
Minds, and therefore are not capable of applying
their Thoughts to the conſideration of Divine
things. Their whole Life is ſpent in Sorrow and
Anguiſh under their Perſecutions and Torments.
This makes 'em mortally hate your Majeſty, and
abhor the Chriſtian Religion; for they can't but
think you impoſe a ſevere Yoke on 'em with intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Tyranny, that you are the moſt covetous
Prince upon Earth, and that therefore they ought
to leave no ſtone unturn'd to get clear of your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
The deſpair under which they lie, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
'em to belch out a thouſand Curſes againſt our
God, attributing all the Miſeries they ſuffer to him,
whom they accuſe of Blindneſs, Injuſtice, and want
of Compaſſion, for not puniſhing the Outrages com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
againſt 'em under the pretence of obliging
'em to embrace his Religion, and for not chaſtiſing
the Impiety of ſuch as make a boaſt of being his
Servants, while they are guilty of the higheſt Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.
This inflames their Zeal towards their
falſe Gods, which they ſay are much better than
ours, who has brought all manner of Miſeries upon
'em, whereas their own were the Authors of all
kinds of Bleſſings.</p>
                           <p>We ſhall make it evidently appear to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in about eight and thirty or
forty years have unjuſtly put to death above twelve
Millions of your Subjects; and what an incredible
damage muſt your Majeſty have farther ſuſtain'd by
theſe Maſſacres, as they have hinder'd all theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from multiplying, who would have amounted to
an infinite number, the People of this new World
being very fruitful, and the Climat generally ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57864:70"/>
temperate and pleaſant, and conſequently very
proper for Generation? The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
and deſtroy'd all theſe Nations, to poſſeſs
themſelves of their Country, and to uſurp the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of it, ſo as to have it entirely at their
diſpoſal. And how injuſt ſoever thoſe Wars have
been which they have made upon the <hi>Indians,</hi> if the
poor Creatures put themſelves in a poſture of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
they cruelly cut their throats without any
diſtinction of Quality, Sex or Age: Such as eſcape
their Fury they reſerve for Slaves, many of whom
they condemn to the Gold or Silver Mines, others
they yoke together like Beaſts to make 'em carry
vaſt Burdens. They don't much concern themſelves
whether the <hi>Indians</hi> live or die, provided they reap
ſome advantage by their Labour, and heap up Gold
at any rate in the World. I paſs over in ſilence a
great many of the Torments theſe poor People have
been made to endure on all occaſions. If any ſhall
attempt to perſwade your Majeſty of the contrary,
we'l undertake to prove what Violence the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
have us'd among the <hi>Indians</hi> by invincible and
undoubted Evidence: And ſhall not ſcruple to ſay,
that whoever take upon 'em to deny the truth of
theſe matters, have in all appearance partaken of
thoſe Robberies, or at leaſt hope to have a ſhare of
'em one time or other. For what ſhew of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
is there in ſaying the Contagion of the Air
has ſo entirely deſtroy'd the People of a Country of
2500 Leagues extent, that there's ſcarce a Man to
be found?</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who know no other God but their
Intereſt, have ſullied the Reputation of the poor <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
with the moſt odious Stain that can be imagin'd,
in accuſing 'em of being addicted to an infamous
and abominable Sin againſt Nature; a Calumny as
ill contriv'd as 'tis unjuſt. For that Crime has never
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57864:71"/>
been heard of in the Iſlands of <hi>Hiſpaniola, St. John,
Cuba,</hi> and <hi>Jamaica,</hi> which have been very populous.
This I can ſpeak with aſſurance, as knowing it to be
true, becauſe I took care to inform my ſelf of it
as ſoon as I came aſhore in the new World. Nor
is it ſo much as known what this Vice is in all <hi>Peru:</hi>
not one Man has ever been found guilty of it in the
whole Kingdom of <hi>Yucatan;</hi> and the like may be
aſſerted in general of other Countries of <hi>America:</hi>
Only 'tis ſaid, that in ſome very remote parts of
it there are ſome People addicted to this monſtrous
Crime: But is it reaſonable for this to accuſe the
whole new World, and to caſt an everlaſting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
on ſo many different Nations? We muſt ſay
the ſame of another Enormity charg'd upon the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
namely their eating of Human Fleſh. There
are indeed in ſome particular places a ſort of Men
ſo barbarous that they eat their own kind; but 'tis
very injuſt to take occaſion from this to report the
ſame of all <hi>America</hi> in general. Another pretence
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> uſe, by which to juſtify their ill Carriage
towards the <hi>Indians,</hi> is their Idolatry; as if it did
not belong to God rather than to them, to puniſh
thoſe that offend him by ſuch abominable Worſhip
when he ſees meet.</p>
                           <p>Beſides, the Lands and Territories they poſſeſs are
not under the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> nor are
the <hi>Indians</hi> oblig'd to own any other Governors than
their lawful and natural Soveraigns. Our Anceſtors
before they were inſtructed in the Doctrine of
Chriſtianity, were buried in the groſs darkneſs of
Idolatry as well as the <hi>Indians.</hi> And before the
coming of Chriſt, all the Nations of the World in
general were guilty of that Crime. But that which
evidently proves the Minds of the <hi>Indians</hi> to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſuſceptible of our Religion, is the Mildneſs, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and Courteſy they at firſt expreſs'd to the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57864:71"/>
                              <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the patience wherewith they have
ſince undergone their Cruelties.</p>
                           <p>'Tis a moſt inexcuſable piece of Wickedneſs in
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that they have made uſe of all the
Obſtructions they could, and that deliberately, to
hinder the <hi>Indians</hi> from imbracing the Chriſtian
Faith; they have driven away all the Monks that
came into the <hi>Indies</hi> to preach the Goſpel, from thoſe
places where they had power enough to do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they did not care theſe Religious Perſons
ſhould be Witneſſes of the Tyranny and Cruelty
they exercis'd on the poor People. They have even
debauch'd the <hi>Indians</hi> by the ill Example they have
ſet 'em, and taught 'em a great many Vices they
never heard of before they converſed with the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſuch as Oaths and Blaſphemies againſt the
Name of Chriſt, the Practice of Extortion, Lying,
and many other Sins that ſeem'd oppoſite to the
ſweet and peaceable Temper of theſe People: So
that to leave theſe poor <hi>Indians</hi> under their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is viſibly to expoſe 'em to utter Deſtruction,
and to make 'em miſerable both in Soul and Body.</p>
                           <p>King <hi>Ferdinando</hi> was ſo far impos'd on by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices
of ſome ſelf-intereſted Men, as to give 'em
leave to tranſport the Inhabitants of the <hi>Lucay</hi>-Iſlands
into <hi>Hiſpaniola:</hi> theſe People were forc'd out
of their Houſes, and out of their Country, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
of this Grant, which was ſubtily obtain'd,
and occaſion'd the deſtruction of above a hundred
thouſand People; ſo that there now remain but
eleven of 'em in fifty Iſlands, ſome of which are
bigger than the <hi>Canaries,</hi> that were well ſtor'd with
People. And this I can affirm on my own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
if your Majeſty could have ſeen the Ravages
and Maſſacres that have been committed in the <hi>Lucay</hi>
Iſlands, you would have been pierc'd with the moſt
lively ſentiments of Compaſſion; and then I ſhould
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57864:72"/>
have been afraid to incommode your Majeſty by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
the memory of that Tyranny, in giving an
exact Recital of it. We have taken notice above of
the injuſt Wars the <hi>Spaniards</hi> formerly rais'd againſt
the <hi>Indians;</hi> we have ſhewn how they maſſacred 'em
againſt all Law and Equity, how cruelly they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
'em of their Children, their Parents, and
Friends; how they have laid waſte one of the fineſt
Countries in the World, and render'd it in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
deſtitute of Inhabitants. This Barbarity makes
the Earth groan, the Angels lament theſe Miſeries:
And God himſelf has given us to know by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he has inflicted on us, how much theſe injuſt
and violent Actions diſpleaſe him.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have taken from the <hi>Indians</hi> all
they had; they make 'em work till they ſpit Blood,
they expoſe 'em to all ſorts of Hardſhips, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
intolerable Tasks of 'em; and, which is yet more
horrible, after all they load 'em with heavy Blows,
beating, whipping and tormenting 'em with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Cruelty. To give up the <hi>Indians</hi> to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Tyranny of theſe Men, is as great a
madneſs, as to give Children into the hands of Men
that are acted by a raging Phrenzy, and have
Knives and Daggers ready in their hands to cut their
Throats; or to ſacrifice Men to the fury of their
ſworn Enemies, who have long entertain'd the deſire
of Revenge, and form'd a deſign to murder 'em; or
to expoſe a young beautiful Virgin to the Diſcretion
of an impudent Raviſher. Who in ſuch a conjuncture,
without the interpoſition of ſpecial Grace, would
abandon himſelf to the Conduct of his Paſſions?
In a word, it would be the ſame thing as to give 'em
up to ſo many wild Bulls, Wolves, Lions and Tigers,
when inrag'd with preſſing Hunger: for all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions
that ſhould be given theſe wild Beaſts not
to touch ſuch as are expos'd to their fury, would
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57864:72"/>
have juſt the ſame effect to prevent 'em from being
devour'd, as any Charge that can be given the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
to hinder 'em from murdering the <hi>Indians</hi> to
poſſeſs themſelves of their Gold and Silver. We
dare aſſure your Majeſty after the long Obſervation
we have made of theſe matters, that if your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
ſhould order a Gibbet to be ſet up at every
<hi>Spaniard</hi>'s door, and ſhould ſwear upon your Crown,
that you would cauſe every Man to be hang'd that
ſhould kill or offer any conſiderable Injury to the
<hi>Indians</hi> to get their Riches; this would not be an
effectual Remedy to theſe Diſorders, if your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
gave 'em any Authority or Power over
'em either directly or indirectly. The ſame occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of doing miſchief would ſtill preſent, and
defeat all the Prohibitions that could be made, and
all the Puniſhments that could be us'd to terrify
'em.</p>
                           <p>Nor are the poor <hi>Indians</hi> expos'd only to be made
Slaves by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but ſuffer abundance of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
from a cruel Tyrant, that has the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of each Town or City, who has a ſevere Eye
over 'em, to ſee how they acquit themſelves of
their Labors, and perform the Tasks impos'd on 'em.
His buſineſs is to plague and torment 'em ſo many
different ways, that their Sufferings are almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
compariſon; he beats 'em with Cudgels, tears
their Fleſh with Whips, and cauſes burning drops
of Fat to be diſtill'd on their naked Bodies. He is
continually exerciſing his Invention in contriving
new Tortures, he violates their Wives, takes away
their Turkeys, which they count one of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Treaſures; theſe Fowls ſerve him to make Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
to the General, who is ſuperior to all theſe
petty Tyrants. But 'tis impoſſible to give a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
deſcription of all the Puniſhments theſe poor
Wretches endure; and after all to ſtop their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57864:73"/>
they threaten to accuſe 'em of Idolatry.
Thus the poor <hi>Indians</hi> are ſubject to the Authority
of ſeveral different Powers, to your Majeſty, to their
<hi>Cacique,</hi> and to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Governor, beſides twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
other little Tyrants, deſtitute of Reaſon, Honor
and Conſcience, who commit all ſorts of Outrages;
and likewiſe the <hi>Moors</hi> whom the chief Tyrant em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys
to rob and oppreſs the poor <hi>Indians.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>'Tis much to be fear'd that Almighty God will
make <hi>Spain</hi> feel ſome extraordinary marks of his
Diſpleaſure and Indignation for theſe enormous
Crimes: nay, there appear already ſome tokens of
the Divine Anger againſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation, for
the Diſorders and Devaſtations made by ſome in the
new World: for tho God had laid up ſuch quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Treaſure there, that it may be ſaid neither
<hi>Solomon</hi> nor any other Prince ever poſſeſs'd a ſtock
of Gold and Silver comparable to that which the
People of theſe vaſt Regions enjoy'd; yet they have
bin ſo pillag'd, that now there's little remaining
among 'em: But that which is more unaccountable
is, that there's ſcarce any of that Silver now to be
found, that was ſo common in <hi>America</hi> when the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> firſt diſcover'd it. This makes every thing
extraordinary ſcarce there, ſo that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are
reduc'd to extreme Poverty and Indigence.</p>
                           <p>All the while <hi>Larés</hi> govern'd the <hi>Indies,</hi> there was
no more care taken to inſtil the Principles of
Chriſtianity into the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> and to put 'em
in the way of Salvation, than if they had no Souls
to ſave. This General applied himſelf only to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the great Cities, and would give a hundred <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
to one <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and fifty to another, as he
had more or leſs reſpect for 'em. He made no
diſtinction of Age or Condition, but promiſcuouſly
diſtributed old Men, and big bellied Women, as well
as others, Perſons of Eminency and Princes as well
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57864:73"/>
as the common People, to oblige his Favorites; as
if theſe <hi>Indians</hi> were his abſolute Property. Their
new Maſters made 'em work in the Gold Mines, or
employ'd 'em in any other Service they pleas'd;
and without regard to their Rank or Quality, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
'em to bear this ſlaviſh Yoke till they dy'd.</p>
                           <p>This Governor ſuffer'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to confine
eighty thouſand of 'em in the Mines, who were all
married Men, while their deſolate Wives were forc'd
to labor in the Villages, in digging the ground,
making Ditches, and throwing up Banks, a ſort of
work fit only for the ſtrongeſt Men, and the rather
becauſe they had neither Shovels nor other Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
proper for their buſineſs. In other places
they put 'em upon ſpinning and other works of that
kind, which they found would turn to account; and
would ſometimes keep Husbands and Wives from
ſeeing one another a whole year together; and when
they met after this long ſeparation, they were often
ſo fatigued, and conſum'd with Hunger and Labor,
that they were incapable of Multiplication. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Children dy'd for want of Suſtenance,
their Mothers Milk being exhauſted with hard La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
and Hunger; by this means there dy'd ſeven
thouſand Infants in the ſpace of three months in the
Iſle of <hi>Cuba,</hi> of which I was an Eye-witneſs. Some
of the Women tranſported with deſpair ſtrangl'd
their own Children; others that were with Child
took poiſonous Herbs to deſtroy their Fruit. Thus
the Men dy'd with hardſhip in the Mines, and the
Women in the Villages; ſo that the whole Country
became deſert in a little time, becauſe the Women
ceas'd to bring forth Children into the World.</p>
                           <p>This Governor deliver'd up all the <hi>Indians</hi> to the
Diſcretion of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and ſuffer'd 'em to treat
'em with all the Rigor and Severity they pleas'd,
and to oppreſs 'em with the hardeſt Labor they
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57864:74"/>
could. They employ'd Men to chaſtiſe 'em that
were more ſavage and barbarous than Tygers, theſe
ſcourg'd and beat 'em moſt unmercifully, and gave
them all the ill Treatment they could deviſe; they
would never diſcover the leaſt ſign of Kindneſs or
Pity, but always ſhew'd themſelves auſtere and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly
cruel. It would be very inhuman to treat
the <hi>Moors</hi> themſelves after this manner, tho they
are ſo very cruel to the Chriſtians, and do 'em all the
miſchief they can, when they have the Aſcendent
over 'em. But the <hi>Indians</hi> are naturally a good-humour'd,
eaſy, peaceable, ſubmiſſive, and tractable
ſort of People. Some of 'em have by the many
Miſeries they ſuffer'd, been driven to deſpair of any
mitigation of 'em, and therefore fled into the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
where they expected Death every moment.
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> to hinder 'em from flying after this
manner, appointed a bloody Fellow to make it his
whole buſineſs to hunt out theſe <hi>Indian</hi> Refugees up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Mountains. The Governor beſides eſtabliſh'd
a ſort of Officers in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cities of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
and Authority, whom he call'd Viſitors;
to each of theſe he gave a hundred <hi>Indians</hi> to ſerve
him, beſides his ordinary Domeſticks, the better to
ſupport his Dignity. He choſe ſuch to this Office
as had ſignaliz'd themſelves by their Cruelty. When
the <hi>Alquazils</hi> preſented the <hi>Indians</hi> they found on the
Mountains to theſe Viſitors, there were Perſons
ſuborn'd and inſtructed to accuſe 'em after this
manner; <hi>This Indian is a lazy Dog, that fled into the
Mountains to avoid Work, therefore I deſire he may
be chaſtiz'd as he deſerves.</hi> After the giving of
this Evidence, the Viſitor us'd to cauſe the poor
<hi>Indian</hi> to be tied to a Stake, and beat with a tarr'd
Rope, which the Seamen call a Salt-Eel, and indeed
is like a Rod of Iron, till the Blood would ſtart out
in I know not how many parts of his Body, and the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57864:74"/>
poor Creature would lie for dead upon the place.
God is witneſs of all the Cruelties theſe miſerable
Innocents have endur'd: 'Tis not poſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the hundredth part of what I have ſeen with
my own Eyes. A man had need have a Body of
Iron to undergo the Labor they endure in getting
Gold out of the Mines. They muſt delve and ſearch
a thouſand times over in the bowels of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
till they dig 'em down from top to bottom;
they muſt work the very Rocks hollow. After this
the Gold muſt be waſh'd in ſome River, and the
poor Creatures that do this work muſt be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
in the Water, which gradually alters and
ſpoils the Conſtitution of their Bodies; and if the
Mines happen to be full of Water, they are forc'd
to empty 'em. That your Majeſty may the better
judg of the Labor and Toil they ſuffer in the Gold
Mines, your Majeſty may pleaſe to conſider, that the
Pagan Emperors accounted this the worſt and moſt
intolerable Puniſhment to inflict on the Martyrs,
next to Death it ſelf. The <hi>Indians</hi> are ſometimes
kept a whole year in theſe Mines: but ſince the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
have obſerv'd, that it kill'd moſt of 'em to
keep 'em there ſo long together, becauſe their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
were uncapable of ſuſtaining the Fatigues of
ſuch a tedious and continual Labor, they reſolv'd to
make 'em work only for the ſpace of five months
ſucceſſively, and then to give 'em a reſpite of forty
days, wherein they employ'd 'em in melting Gold.
But this pretended Reſt did 'em no great good, for
they were not much leſs incommoded during this
time than before, being employ'd in other very
troubleſom kinds of Work. The <hi>Indians</hi> don't
know what Holy-days are; for they work as hard
and as long on thoſe days as at other times. Nor
have they a ſufficiency of Bread allow'd 'em; and
what they have is a very ordinary ſort, that has
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57864:75"/>
not much ſtrength in it, being made of Roots and
Caſſave; ſo that if they don't eat Fleſh or Fiſh with
it, it yields very little Nouriſhment. They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
give 'em a ſort of Pepper that grows in the
Country, and looks much like a dry'd Grape.
Thoſe <hi>Spaniards</hi> that pretend to keep their Slaves
extraordinary well, diſtribute a Porker every week
among fifty <hi>Indians;</hi> but he that preſides over 'em
at the Mine keeps one half of it for his ſhare, and
gives them the other, which is but every one a bit.
Some of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are ſo wretchedly covetous,
that they ſend their Slaves into the Fields and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to feed upon what Fruit they can find, and
then oblige 'em to work two or three days without
giving 'em any thing to eat. Your Majeſty may
eaſily imagine, that ſuch kind of Food can't poſſibly
ſuſtain their weak and languiſhing Bodies, that are
continually enfeebled and exhauſted with hard La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor;
or that theſe poor Creatures that are mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
with all manner of Hardſhip and Fatigue,
without any reſt, or relaxation of their Miſery, can
live long under the preſſures of ſo cruel a Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                           <p>The abovemention'd Governor at laſt order'd
they ſhould have Wages diſtributed among 'em, <hi>viz.</hi>
that three<note n="*" place="bottom">A Blanc is about the value of a Half-penny.</note> Blancs ſhould be given each of 'em to
ſpend every two days, as the Reward of the hard
Labors they exacted of 'em. This was only to mock
the poor Wretches, for this Mony would ſcarce
buy 'em the leaſt Trifle. But for many years they
had nothing at all given 'em, yet this does not
diſturb 'em ſo much as want of Victuals; for there
is nothing in the world they ſo much deſire as to
eat well, inſomuch that if they could but ſatisfy
themſelves with one good Meal, they would after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57864:75"/>
be content to die. This Governor depriv'd
'em of all the liberty they enjoy'd, and ſuffer'd the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> to inſlave 'em, and treat 'em as ſeverely
as they pleas'd; and indeed the ill uſage they have
met with is beyond what the Mind of man can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
They have not the liberty to diſpoſe of any
thing they have: The condition of Beaſts is prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to theirs, for theſe are at leaſt ſometimes turn'd
looſe to fill their Bellies with Graſs in the fields, and
have a little eaſe and liberty; whereas the poor
<hi>Indians</hi> have ſcarce any time of reſt allow'd 'em,
but are conſtrain'd to do whatever the covetous
<hi>Spaniards</hi> command 'em. They lead 'em to work
like Beaſts of Burden rather than Men. If at any
time they give 'em leave to go home to take a little
Repoſe, they neither find their Wives nor Children
there, nor any thing to eat, and have no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
than to lay themſelves down and die. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
Fatigue they undergo wears 'em out the
ſooner, becauſe they are naturally of a weak and
tender Conſtitution; and when they are ſick and
faint, they are ſtill made to work without any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion:
nay, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are ſo cruel as to beat
and abuſe 'em when they are juſt ready to die, calling
'em lazy Raſcals, as if they refus'd to work, and
feign'd themſelves ſick, merely out of Idleneſs. At
laſt when they ſee their Illneſs increaſe to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that they can expect no more Service of 'em,
they ſend 'em home, giving 'em ſix or ſeven great
Roots, almoſt like Turnips, with a ſmall quantity
of Caſſave, to carry 'em a journey of fifty or ſixty
Leagues; ſo that they often miſerably languiſh and
die before they have proceeded far on their way:
we often found a great many of 'em dead on the
Roads, others we found ready to expire, and others
by their Groans and Sighs gave us to underſtand
their extreme Hunger. When the Governor had
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57864:76"/>
not a ſufficient number of Men for the Works in
the Mines, he ſupplied the places of them that were
releas'd by death, by caſting Lots for others, which
method was obſerv'd once a year.</p>
                           <p>When he enter'd into the Continent, he came
like a ſweeping Judgment of God, or as a Wolf
among Sheep: He committed ſo many Robberies,
Maſſacres and Cruelties, depopulated and deſtroy'd
ſo many Towns and Cities, giving the <hi>Spaniards</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to do what they pleas'd, that no Hiſtory can
parallel his Barbarity: He robb'd both the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> and his Subjects, without being ever call'd to
account for it; he left above forty Leagues of a
very populous and fertil Country to the diſcretion
or rather fury of his Soldiers: All that pleaſant
Tract of Ground from <hi>Daria</hi> where he landed to
<hi>Nicaraqua</hi> was reduc'd to the utmoſt Deſolation;
ſo that five or ſix Millions of Mony will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
the Damage done there. This vile and cruel
Man abandon'd the <hi>Indians</hi> to the Tyranny of the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> which was the ſource and original Cauſe
of all the Perſecutions under which thoſe poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have ſince groan'd, and of all the Devaſtations
that <hi>America</hi> has ſuffer'd wherever the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
have ſet their feet. This Contagion by degrees
ſpread far and near; ſo that this General by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
looſe his Soldiers after this licentious manner,
has occaſion'd the ruin of many millions of Men,
and the deſolation of divers great Kingdoms that
were ſubjected to your Majeſty's Dominion. If we
ſay the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have deſtroy'd ſeven Kingdoms
bigger than that of <hi>Spain,</hi> we can ſpeak it with
confidence, as knowing it to be true, and having
known the time when they were fill'd with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of People, tho now there are ſcarce any to
be found, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having extirpated the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of theſe large Kingdoms, and left the Walls
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57864:76"/>
and Houſes of the Towns and Cities without Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.</p>
                           <p>Your Majeſty has no fix'd and conſtant Revenue
in the <hi>Indies;</hi> your Effects are like Leaves, which
when once they fall from the Trees appear no more
till a year after. That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are poſſeſs'd
of the abſolute Government of the <hi>Indies</hi> is the
true cauſe of this Diſorder; for the number of the
<hi>Indians</hi> every day decreaſing, your Majeſty's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
muſt neceſſarily receive a proportionable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution.</p>
                           <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> is in great danger to be
invaded by Foreign Nations, eſpecially by the <hi>Moors</hi>
and <hi>Turks,</hi> who perhaps may one day be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to deſtroy it: For God is a juſt Judg, and
cannot look upon the Villanies and Oppreſſions, the
Robberies and Murders of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi>
without indignation. All the Nations of this new
World, who were created (as well as his others) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the likeneſs and image of God, and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom'd
by the precious Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, have
been unjuſtly and cruelly tormented and perſecuted
by 'em; they have made horrible ſlaughters among
'em to requite the many Kindneſſes they heap'd on
'em with all imaginable Freedom and Civility. And
that which ſtill aggravates their Crimes the more,
and muſt needs farther provoke the Divine Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
is, that God had made choice of <hi>Spain</hi> to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
his bleſſed Goſpel into the <hi>Indies,</hi> and to bring
many populous Nations to the knowledg of himſelf;
for which if they had fallen in with his Deſigns, he
would, beſides thoſe eternal Rewards reſerv'd for
'em, have given into their hands many good and
fruitful Countries, abounding with Mines of Gold
and Silver, Diamonds and other precious Stones
and Pearls; in a word, with all ſorts of temporal
Bleſſings, beyond what any one can imagine, unleſs
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57864:77"/>
ſuch as have ſeen it with their own eyes. And 'tis
to be remark'd that God uſually obſerves this Rule
in the execution of his Judgments, to proportionate
his Penalties to the Crimes committed againſt him.</p>
                           <p>The Outrages and Cruelties theſe innocent People
have felt are ſo horrid and notorious, that their
Tears and Groans and Blood, the cry of which has
reach'd the Throne of God, will undoubtedly draw
down Vengeance on thoſe that have offer'd all this
violence to their Perſons, and plunder'd 'em of their
Eſtates. The Report of theſe Cruelties is ſpread
through the whole World, and has been carried even
to the moſt barbarous Nations, and has made 'em ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and conceive a mortal hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
'em: A hatred which extends to the Perſon of
our King, as well as Subjects, and is extremely
prejudicial to the whole Nation in general.</p>
                           <p>None can be ſo ignorant as not to foreſee what
Miſchiefs the Deſolations in <hi>America</hi> are like to
bring upon <hi>Spain;</hi> and ſucceeding Generations will
be but too much convinc'd of the truth of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy:
And if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſtill ſuffers the

<hi>Spain</hi> feel the Effects of his Wrath in puniſhing ſuch

                           <p>
                              <hi>Moſt Illuſtrious and Mighty Prince;</hi> The Royal
Council for the <hi>Indies,</hi> animated with a ſincere Zeal
for the Glory of God, and your Majeſty's Honour,
deſir'd me a few days ago to write to your Majeſty
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57864:77"/>
all that I had told you <hi>viva voce</hi> before, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
to you what Right the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have to
thoſe Kingdoms in the <hi>Indies:</hi> and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſome who are uneaſy to ſee the liberty your
Majeſty is pleas'd to give me in converſing with
your Royal Perſon about theſe Affairs, to engage
you to regulate thoſe Diſorders committed in <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
have declar'd againſt my Sentiments with a great
deal of heat and animoſity. They ſay the Zeal
with which I oppoſe the Violence and Injuſtice of
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (and theſe I'm reſolv'd to oppoſe as
long as it pleaſes God to continue my life) prompts
men to call in queſtion the Title the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
pretends to have to the New World. However I
have perform'd what the Council demanded of me,
and drawn up thirty Propoſitions, without giving
my ſelf the trouble of proving them at large, partly
becauſe they are all certain and evident, and partly
becauſe I was much urg'd to diſpatch the buſineſs,
and to ſend them to your Majeſty; which I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd
in the fear of God, and according to
the dictates of my Conſcience, with a ſtrict regard
to Truth.</p>
                           <p>Since the deſire I have of being ſerviceable to God
daily increaſes, I thought my ſelf oblig'd to refute
the Impoſtures and Calumnies of ſome ill-deſigning
Perſons, who wilfully ſhut their eyes againſt the
Truth, becauſe 'tis directly oppoſite to the Deſigns
and Projects they have form'd. They flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that under the falſe pretext of ſerving the
Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> who are ordinarily of a ſweet and
benign temper, and ready to judg of others by the
good Sentiments they find in themſelves; I ſay, they
flatter themſelves that they ſhall ſtill be able to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
on 'em, and bear a ſufficient ſway in their minds
to bring 'em into the ſnares they have laid for 'em.
It was the complaint of <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> in the Hiſtory of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57864:78"/>
                              <hi>Eſther,</hi> that corrupt and vicious Subjects alter'd the
good diſpoſition of Princes, and betray'd 'em into
Exceſſes, that occaſion'd the ruin of whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and their Kings together. 'Tis for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<hi>Great Sir,</hi> I have briefly drawn up theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
to ſet this matter before you in a clear light.
This I have done to diſcharge my own Conſcience,
and that I might the better anſwer the Obligations of
that Miniſtry wherewith God has entruſted me. I
find my ſelf growing old, being advanc'd to the 50<hi>th</hi>
year of my age; and the great acquaintance I have
had with the Affairs of <hi>America,</hi> has furniſh'd me with
a very diſtinct knowledg of 'em; ſo that my circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
render me in ſome reſpects more capable
than others of giving proper Advice to thoſe that
are propos'd for the Government of <hi>America,</hi> that
they may know how to put a period to its Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
for I have no other intention or deſire in this
matter, than that of ſuppreſſing the Injuſtice and
Cruelty that has ſo long haraſs'd the Inhabitants of
the New World.</p>
                           <p>They that endeavour to croſs my good Deſign
with the greateſt warmth, and deck themſelves with
a falſe appearace of zeal and affection to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
tho at the bottom they have no regard either
to truth or juſtice, take care to hide their Deſigns
under the ſpecious colour of promoting your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Service and Intereſt, and of eſtabliſhing your
Majeſtiy's Right and Title to <hi>America,</hi> while indeed
all they do is directly contrary to your Majeſty's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
whether in reſpect of Spirituals or Temporals.
And I believe all intelligent Chriſtians, that have a
true zeal for their Religion, will be of this opinion,
when I have made the Errors and Extravagancies of
thoſe that oppoſe my Sentiments appear; for theſe
Gentlemen hand over head maintain that the Kings
of <hi>Spain</hi> have a Right to found and eſtabliſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57864:78"/>
a Title to the Government of <hi>America</hi> by
force of Arms, after the ſame manner that <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi>
who was the firſt mighty Hunter (as the
Scripture expreſly obſerves) and firſt began to
tyrannize over Men, laid the foundation of his
Dominion; or as <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and the
antient Romans extended the bounds of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
or juſt as the Turks to this day oppreſs the
Chriſtians, and invade their Territories. All the
World may eaſily perceive that they who reaſon thus,
are ignorant of the true Intereſt of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and ſhamefully violate all the Rules of Juſtice. To
prove what they advance, they add new Errors to their
firſt Extravagancies, till they ſhew by the wretched
Maxims they expoſe, that they have neither Honor
nor Chriſtianity. For it often falls out, that while
they who wander from the Tract of Truth and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
go about to excuſe the Errors they have made,
they fall into other Miſtakes that are ſtill more groſs
and dangerous.</p>
                           <p>There are others of 'em who produce Titles that
appear to be ſomewhat better founded, and alledg
Arguments that ſeem more probable and honeſt.
Theſe ſay we may juſtly take poſſeſſion of the <hi>Indies,</hi>
and ſubdue the People, becauſe we have a greater
ſtock of Prudence and Wiſdom than other Nations,
and becauſe our Country is nearer to the <hi>Indies</hi> than
many others. But 'tis eaſy to ſee that none of theſe
Reaſons are concluding, having no ſolid Foundation
to ſupport 'em.</p>
                           <p>That your Majeſty may the better comprehend
the force of the Reaſons that have been produc'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you, and more eaſily diſtinguiſh what is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Rules of Equity from what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to 'em, and diſcern your faithful Servants
from ſuch as mind nothing but their own Intereſt,
I ſhall come my ſelf, and <hi>viva voce</hi> explain to your
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57864:79"/>
Majeſty the principal Points on which my Judgment
is founded. In the mean time I ſend your Majeſty
an Abſtract of my Propoſitions, which your Majeſty
may cauſe to be tranſlated into Latin, if you think
meet, that they may be printed both in the Latin
and Spaniſh Tongues: or if your Majeſty don't ſee
good to make 'em publick, 'twill be no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

They ought moreover to be engag'd by Preſents,

this means they would be eaſily perſwaded, that the

                           <p>DR. <hi>Sepulueda,</hi> at the inſtigation of ſome <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
who had committed great Ravages in
the <hi>Indies,</hi> wrote a very elegant Book in Latin in the
form of Dialogues, which contain'd principally two
Concluſions, namely, that the Wars of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
in the <hi>Indies</hi> were very juſt, and that they might
lawfully ſubjugate the People of this new World;
and that the <hi>Indians</hi> were oblig'd to ſubmit to the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> and acquieſce in their Government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
theſe are more wiſe and prudent than the
others. And in caſe they refuſe to ſubmit, this
Doctor aſſerts, that they may be conſtrain'd to it
by force of Arms. Theſe are the two Points that
have occaſion'd the ruin of incredible numbers of
<hi>Indians;</hi> ſo that the Country is almoſt entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled
for the ſpace of two thouſand Leagues,
where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have left the marks of their
boundleſs Cruelty. This Doctor, to give ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
and ſhew of Truth to his Reaſons, declar'd that
he had no other deſign in writing than that of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Title to the <hi>Indies.</hi> He
preſented his Book to the Royal Council, and was
very importunate to obtain leave to print it, which
was ſeveral times refus'd; after which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
himſelf to ſome of his Friends, who were in
the Emperor's Court, to patronize this Work. The
Biſhop of <hi>Chiapa</hi> being well inform'd of the ſteps
this Doctor made, with all his might oppos'd the
Impreſſion of his Book, plainly demonſtrating what
ill Conſequences the publication of it might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.
The Members of the King's Council per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57864:85"/>
this matter was purely Theological, reſolv'd
to diſmiſs it to the Univerſities of <hi>Salamanca</hi> and
<hi>Alcala,</hi> deſiring them to make a thorow Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Treatiſe, to ſee if it contain'd any thing
that might juſtly obſtruct the printing of it. Theſe
two Univerſities after they had accuratly examin'd
it, declar'd that it was not fit to be printed, as
containing unſound Doctrine. The Doctor now
deſpairing of ſeeing his Book obtain in <hi>Spain,</hi> ſent
it to <hi>Rome,</hi> earneſtly recommending it to the Biſhop
of <hi>Segovia,</hi> who was one of his particular Friends.
When it was printed, it was prohibited by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's
expreſs Order, who caus'd the Copies to be
ſeiz'd, forbidding any of 'em to be ſold in <hi>Spain:</hi>
but becauſe it was impoſſible to prevent divers Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
in the vulgar Language from being ſpread
among the People; the Biſhop of <hi>Chiapa</hi> thought
himſelf oblig'd to refute this Book in defence of
the <hi>Indians,</hi> and to let all the world know how ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Doctrine it contain'd, being accommodated
to open a door to all manner of Diſorders. Dr. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulueda</hi>
was cited to give an account of his thoughts
on this Subject by word of mouth, and the Biſhop of
<hi>Chiapa</hi> was engag'd to anſwer him: The Diſpute

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57864:86"/>
to ſupport the Sentiments of either of 'em. The Point
about which you deſire to be inform'd, is in general
what method ought to be us'd for the publication of
the Catholic Faith in the new World, which has bin
lately diſcover'd by the permiſſion of God, and how
the Emperor may ſubject thoſe Nations to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
without offending his Conſcience, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
himſelf entirely to the Bull of Pope <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi>
'Tis firſt neceſſary to enquire whether the
Emperor may juſtly make War with the <hi>Indians</hi>
before the Faith of the Goſpel be preach'd to 'em;
and whether theſe People will be in any condition to
receive the Light of the Goſpel, after they have
bin ſubdu'd by force of Arms; whether they will
be more tractable and docil, and better diſpos'd to
receive the Impreſſions deſign'd to be given, ſo as to
reject their Errors, and embrace the Doctrine of
the Goſpel. Dr. <hi>Sepulueda</hi> maintains, that this War
is not only allowable and lawful, but neceſſary.
The Biſhop of <hi>Chiapa</hi> is of the contrary Opinion,
and pretends that this War is unjuſt, and an invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
Obſtacle to the propagation of the Faith in the
<hi>Indies.</hi>

                                 <hi>Sepulueda</hi> ſupports his Opinion by four principal
Arguments: The firſt is founded on the enormous
Crimes of which the <hi>Indians</hi> have bin, and are eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day guilty, eſpecially their Idolatry, and their
Sins againſt Nature. His ſecond Reaſon is taken
from their Barbarity and Ignorance, which may be
reform'd under the Government of a People ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
and polite as the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> His third
Reaſon reſpects the facility he ſuppoſes of publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Chriſtian Faith to the <hi>Indians</hi> when they are
once ſubdu'd. His fourth Argument is taken from
the cruel Treatment the <hi>Indians</hi> give one another, in
that they offer human Sacrifices to their falſe Gods.
He confirms his firſt Reaſon three ways: 1<hi>ſt.</hi> By
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57864:86"/>
Examples and Authorities taken out of the holy
Scripture. 2<hi>dly.</hi> By the Suffrage of Doctors and
Canoniſts. 3<hi>dly.</hi> By a particular account of the
groſs Crimes which the <hi>Indians</hi> commit. He cites
a Paſſage out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. to explain after what
manner War ought to be made on the <hi>Indians;</hi> the
words are theſe: <hi>When thou comeſt nigh unto a City
to fight againſt it, then proclaim Peace unto it. And it
ſhall be, if it make thee anſwer of Peace, and open unto
thee, then it ſhall be that all the People that is found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
ſhall be Tributaries unto thee, and they ſhall ſerve
thee. And if it will make no Peace with thee, but will
make War againſt thee, then thou ſhalt beſiege it: And
when the LORD thy God hath deliver'd it into thy
hands, thou ſhalt ſmite every Male thereof with the
Edg of the Sword:</hi> ver. 10, 11, 12, 13. and <hi>ver. 16.
But of the Cities of theſe People which the Lord thy God
doth give thee for an Inheritance, thou ſhalt ſave alive
nothing that breatheth.</hi> The Doctor adds, that this
Paſſage is not to be ſtrictly taken, and enforc'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Indians</hi> with ſo much ſeverity: tho 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſaid, <hi>Thus ſhalt thou do unto all the Cities that are very
far from thee;</hi> by which Paſſage the Gloſs underſtands
thoſe of different Religions. From hence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
that we may lawfully declare War againſt
thoſe Nations that are of a Religion different from
ours.</p>
                              <p>My Lord <hi>Biſhop</hi> anſwers him four ways. Firſt, he
ſays, it was not to puniſh the Sin of Idolatry, that
God commanded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to make War with
the Gentiles and Infidels: That God was pleas'd to
ſingle out preciſely ſeven Nations, the <hi>Canaanites,</hi>
the <hi>Jebuſites,</hi> &amp;c. mentioned in <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. who poſſeſs'd
the Land of Promiſe bequeathed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and
his Poſterity. He allows it to be true, that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
to puniſh the Idolatry of thoſe Heathen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in giving 'em up to the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> but he ſays
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57864:87"/>
if God's intention had bin only to chaſtiſe 'em for
their Idolatry, he would alſo have puniſh'd all the
Nations of the whole World after the ſame manner,
ſeeing they were all polluted with the ſame Sin.
Whereas God ſpecified only theſe Nations to be
abandon'd to the Sword of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to ſhew
that it was rather to accompliſh the Promiſe he had
made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> than to puniſh theſe Idolaters
that he deliver'd 'em into the hands of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
That God himſelf expreſly forbad the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
to offer any Violence to the <hi>Edomites,</hi> or to the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> who had entertain'd 'em when they were
ſtrangers in their Country.</p>
                              <p>Secondly, That the Paſſage of <hi>Luke</hi> 14. where it
is ſaid, <hi>Compel them to come in,</hi> is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of an external Conſtraint by War and Arms,
but ought to be interpreted of internal Inſpiration,
and the Motions which God produces in the Hearts
of Men, either immediatly, or by the Miniſtration
of Angels.</p>
                              <p>In the third place the Biſhop maintains, that Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Emperors have never engag'd in War with
Heathen Nations to oblige 'em to renounce Idolatry,
and to induce 'em to imbrace the Chriſtian Faith;
that the Wars of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> were purely on a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic
account, and that the Paſſage of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Hiſtorian, <hi>lib. 10. cap.</hi> 6. is to be underſtood
in that ſenſe. That this Prince who was ſo ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
with Piety, when he ſubdued by his Arms the
<hi>Goths, Sarmatians,</hi> and other barbarous Nations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
thoſe that ſought his Friendſhip, and deſir'd
Peace. That becauſe he ſubjected himſelf to the
Divine Commands, God was pleas'd to recompenſe
his Virtue in ſubjecting all the People of the World
to his Dominion. Beſides, he ſays, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> made
War with the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Sarmatians,</hi> becauſe they
made incredible Ravage and Spoil wherever they
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57864:87"/>
came. But when theſe barbarous People were at
peace with the Chriſtians, and offer'd 'em no Injury,
they were ſuffer'd to live at quiet.</p>
                              <p>He adds in the 4<hi>th</hi> place, That if we would do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good upon Pagans, it muſt be by the power of
good Examples, and not by Violence. He cites to
this purpoſe a paſſage of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> who ſays it
belongs only to men tranſported with Rage, and to
Aſſaſſins to uſe force againſt thoſe that are inferior to
'em in Power: that this Father alſo condemns ſuch
as were not able to do the Pagans any hurt, and yet
raſhly offer'd themſelves to death, to gain the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Martyrs. He alſo quotes a Paſſage out of
<hi>Deut. 7. When the Lord thy God ſhall bring thee into the
Land whither thou goeſt to poſſeſs it,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 1. <hi>Ye
ſhall deſtroy their Altars, and break down their Images,
and cut down their Groves, and burn their graven Images
with Fire,</hi> ver. 5. Upon which Paſſage he ſays St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi>
expreſſes himſelf after this manner: Many of
the Pagans have Idols in their Fields, muſt we take
upon us to break theſe Idols in pieces? 'Tis much
better to endeavour to get 'em out of their Hearts.
When they have embrac'd Chriſtianity, and exhort
us themſelves to break theſe Idols, we ſhall do it with
pleaſure. We muſt in the mean time pray for their
Converſion, without appearing violent and paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
againſt 'em becauſe of their Idolatry: We are
not ignorant where they hide their Idols, and yet
we let 'em alone, becauſe God has not given us a
Commiſſion to take 'em away without their leave.
When then does God give us leave to take 'em from
them? Not till the owners of theſe Idols are become
Chriſtians.</p>
                              <p>He farther produces the examples of the Apoſtles
and Martyrs, who took no other courſe to overthrow
Idols but by their Doctrine. He grants that indeed
on ſome accounts War may be made with Infidels;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57864:88"/>
for inſtance, if they have violently uſurp'd the Lands
of Chriſtians, as they have the <hi>Holy-Land;</hi> if they
profane our Churches, break down our Images, and
offer any great outrages to Chriſtians, in hatred and
contempt of their Faith: That when the Emperor
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> forbad the Heathens to keep their Idols,
it was for fear the Chriſtians ſhould be ſcandaliz'd
by 'em.</p>
                              <p>He ſays, If God ſeverely puniſh'd the Crimes of
the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> it does not therefore follow that we
may take upon us to puniſh all Infidels for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Pollutions: That we are to admire the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, but not always to imitate every
thing he does. He ſays, we may puniſh Infidels if
they blaſpheme the Holy Name of God, or diſhonour
the Saints and the Church; if they openly hinder
the publication of the Faith, and if they maſſacre
thoſe that preach it: but that it is not lawful to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
War againſt 'em merely on the account of their
Idolatry, their unnatural Sins, or any other Crimes
they commit among themſelves.</p>
                              <p>And whereas Dr. <hi>Sepulueda</hi> ſays, The Indians are
a barbarous People, and born for Slavery: the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Chiapa</hi> anſwers this Objection, in ſaying,
That we ought not to make War upon Infidels to
bring 'em to the true Religion, which is only to be
demonſtrated by genuin Reaſons, that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
may be captivated according to the words
of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> That it muſt be a pious Affection to the
Chriſtian Faith that will diſpoſe men to embrace
it; and that care ought to be taken that they may
have no averſion againſt thoſe that preach it; who
therefore ought by their good Examples to engage
the <hi>Indians</hi> to reliſh the Doctrine they endeavour to
propagate among 'em: That War is viſibly contrary
to this end, becauſe it fills the minds of thoſe Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
with horror and indignation againſt the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57864:88"/>
for bringing ſo many Miſeries upon 'em; and
that they cannot chuſe but think the Law of Chriſt
an execrable Doctrine, ſince it authorizes (as they
imagin) ſuch terrible Diſorders. The Biſhop con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
in ſaying, 'tis a mere deluſion to aſſert, that
the Wars made againſt theſe Infidels are not deſign'd
to introduce Chriſtianity among 'em by open force,
but only to ſubjugate thoſe barbarous Nations the
better to diſpoſe 'em to receive the Faith of Chriſt
voluntarily. He pretends that this is ill reaſoning,
becauſe War ſpreads ſo much terror among thoſe
People, that if they afterwards embrace the true
Faith, 'tis to be ſuppos'd they do it rather out of fear
than love: and that their Neighbours when they hear
what Violence, Spoil, and Maſſacres have attended
this War, may probably, to avoid the like Miſchiefs,
blindly embrace the Faith, without knowing what
they do themſelves.</p>
                              <p>Dr. <hi>Sepulueda</hi> urges for another reaſon of War,
that the <hi>Indians</hi> maſſacre innocent Perſons, either to
ſacrifice, or to eat 'em. To which Argument the
Biſhop returns this anſwer, That if the Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
us to undertake the defence of Innocents, it
ought not in this caſe to be by the way of Arms.
Firſt, becauſe of two Evils we ought to chuſe the
leaſt. If the <hi>Indians</hi> maſſacre ſome innocent Perſons
to eat 'em, 'tis indeed a great Evil; but War would
bring much greater ſlaughters with it: beſides, that
theſe Wars diſhonour our Religion, and render the
Chriſtians odious to the Infidels; who tho they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
men, are not altogether inexcuſable, becauſe
of their great Ignorance, and have reaſon not to
put themſelves into the hands of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who come with their Swords in their hands to
rob and kill 'em, inſtead of inſtructing 'em in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
whereas they have no right to puniſh 'em for
their Errors: That <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays, when the <hi>Romans</hi>
                                 <pb n="158" facs="tcp:57864:89"/>
ſubdued divers barbarous Nations, who were wont
to offer men in Sacrifice, they did not puniſh 'em for
that Crime, but only forbad 'em to do the like for
the future. That it is not to be expected of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
that they ſhould renounce their Errors in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
that the light of Nature which informs 'em
there is a God, teaches 'em to ſhew him reſpect, and
to return him thanks for the Benefits they receive
of him, and likewiſe to endeavour to make atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the Sins they commit againſt his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty;
and that they ought to devote the beſt they
have to him in Sacrifice: Conſequently their evil
Cuſtom of ſacrificing human Creatures to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
Deities they worſhip, is the leſs to be wonder'd
at, ſince they have no knowledg of Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but only the glimmerings of natural Light to
direct 'em; which Light too is obſcur'd with much
thick darkneſs in the minds of Pagans. That theſe
People believe they perform a very acceptable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to God, when they offer him the Lives of Men;
that this may be confirmed in ſome ſort by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of Holy Writ, ſeeing God, when he would
try the faithfulneſs of <hi>Abraham,</hi> commanded him to
ſacrifice his only Son, whom he tenderly lov'd;
which God might do, as he is the abſolute Maſter of
the Lives of Men: that beſides this Inſtance, the
Scripture teſtifies that God requir'd the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to
redeem their own Lives by the ſacrifice of Animals.
That the Word of God remarks, that 'tis impoſſible
to give a greater Teſtimony of Love, than to offer
ones ſelf for the Perſon belov'd: that thoſe Women
in the <hi>Indies</hi> that were moſt dear to their Husbands
while they lived, choſe to be buried alive with 'em,
to give the greater proof of their conjugal Fidelity
and Affection.</p>
                              <p>In anſwer to the other Argument alledg'd by Dr.
<hi>Sepulueda,</hi> namely, that the barbarity of the <hi>Indians</hi>
                                 <pb n="159" facs="tcp:57864:89"/>
which (he ſays) ſhews they were born for Slavery,
is a ſufficient reaſon to declare War againſt 'em, in
order to ſubject 'em to the Government of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans:</hi>
the Biſhop of <hi>Chiapa</hi> ſays, there are three
different ſorts of <hi>Barbarians.</hi> Firſt, that this Term
is taken in general to ſignify any Nation that differs
from others by ſome ſtrange Opinion, or peculiar
Cuſtoms, tho they want not Prudence or Policy to
conduct their Affairs. That the ſecond kind of
<hi>Barbarians</hi> is of thoſe, who have no Language pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
by which to expreſs themſelves to other People;
ſuch as the Engliſh formerly were, when they had
no Letters or Characters whereby to explain their
Thoughts. The third ſort of <hi>Barbarians</hi> are ſuch as
reſemble ſavage Beaſts, by the dulneſs and ſtupidity
of their Minds, by their brutiſh Inclinations, and by
the extravagance of their Cuſtoms; who wander up
and down in the Fields, never dwelling together in
Towns or Cities; who are without Laws or Civil
Government, and take no care to obſerve the Law of
Nations; who rove about to commit Robberies,
and uſe Violence on all that have not power enough
to reſiſt 'em; ſuch as the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Alans</hi> were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
and ſuch as the <hi>Arabs</hi> in <hi>Aſia</hi> are to this day:
That 'tis as lawful to make War with this ſort of
People, as to hunt wild Beaſts, and would be a great
piece of ſervice to the World to reduce 'em to any
tolerable Diſciplin. But as for the <hi>Indians,</hi> that
tho they have ſome extravagant Cuſtoms, but
not any good Policy, yet they ought not to be
look'd upon as properly <hi>Barbarians;</hi> ſeeing they are
of a quite contrary diſpoſition, being meek, civil,
and tractable in their Manners; that they are a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
People, who have Cities and Laws, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
divers Arts; that they have Princes over
'em, and live under a kind of regulated Government;
that they not only puniſh Sins againſt Nature, but
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57864:90"/>
have Laws that award capital Puniſhments for ſome
Crimes of leſſer conſequence: That their Policy has
its particular Rules; that upon all theſe Accounts
their pretended Barbarity is not a ſufficient Reaſon
for any to declare War againſt 'em, but would be a
piece of viſible Tyranny and Injuſtice; and that
this Courſe would be ſo far from promoting the
Goſpel, that 'twould be the very way to cut off all
hope of eſtabliſhing Chriſtianity among them. That
therefore the beſt expedient would be to ſend
Preachers into the <hi>Indies,</hi> to endeavour to convince
ſome of the principal <hi>Indians</hi> of the truth of our
Religion; and to make Treaties of Peace with 'em,
to favour the entrance of the <hi>Europeans</hi> into the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
by ſuch a gentle and peaceable Method as this:
that if any danger ſhould ariſe after this, we might
build ſome Forts upon the Frontiers, and ſo treat
with 'em with the greater Security, and make 'em
gradually reliſh our Religion, by ſetting 'em good
Examples.</p>
                              <p>The Royal Council for the <hi>Indies</hi> having heard this
Diſpute, between the Biſhop of <hi>Chiapa</hi> and Dr. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulueda,</hi>
concerning the manner in which the <hi>Indians</hi>
ought to be treated, order'd the Biſhop to draw up
his Thoughts of this matter in Writing, whereby
they ſhould be the better able to determin this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Whether they might lawfully inſlave the <hi>Indians,</hi>
or were oblig'd to ſet at liberty all they had hitherto
reduc'd to ſlavery. In anſwer to their deſire, the
Biſhop farther explain'd his Sentiments after the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
manner.</p>
                              <p>All the <hi>Indians</hi> taken in the <hi>Indies</hi> ſince the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the New World to this day, have bin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
inſlav'd; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who retain 'em in
bondage againſt their wills, can't do it with a good
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57864:90"/>
Conſcience, becauſe they had no right to declare
War againſt 'em; for it follows by conſequence they
could not lawfully deprive 'em of their Liberty, nor
were they ever authoriz'd by their Prince to make
War upon 'em. Now there are but two Motives
that can render any War juſt, namely, ſome righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Cauſe, or the Authority of one's Prince. And
what juſt motive then could the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
War againſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> who never did 'em
any wrong, nor ever gave 'em any diſturbance? They
were people they had never ſeen; they had never
made any deſcent into any Country that belong'd to
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to ſpoil and ravage it; they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
profeſs'd Chriſtianity as the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Africa</hi> had
done, who were Chriſtian in the time of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin;</hi>
or as the Kingdom of <hi>Grenada,</hi> the Empire
of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did
formerly. Nor can we juſtly reproach the <hi>Indians</hi> as
declar'd enemies to our Religion, or that they ever
attempted to deſtroy it by open Perſecutions, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Perſwaſions, by Preſents, or any other manner
whatſoever, that can be uſed to engage Chriſtians to
renounce their Faith, and turn Idolaters: For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Law of God, nor that of Nations ever
permitted War to be made againſt any People mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to eſtabliſh Chriſtianity among 'em. Unleſs any
one will pretend that the Goſpel of Chriſt, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
with Charity, Meekneſs, and Humanity, ought
to be introduc'd into the World by Force like the
Religion of <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> can't ſay, that they had no other
end than that of protecting the Innocent, ſeeing
they have made it their whole buſineſs to rob, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
and murder the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> taking upon 'em
to uſurp their Goods and Lands. Beſides, if the
War they undertook had bin in defence of thoſe poor
Wretches the <hi>Indians</hi> unjuſtly put to death for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57864:91"/>
it would not have bin carried ſo generally
thro' the <hi>Indies,</hi> but would have bin a ſort of Civil
War kept up only in ſome particular Places: Nor
would the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have had right even in ſuch Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to have made Slaves of thoſe whom they took
in ſuch a War.</p>
                              <p>They can't ſo much as pretend that ever they had
a Command or Order to this day from their Prince,
to declare War againſt the <hi>Indians:</hi> 'Tis eaſy to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
ſuch a Fact as this; for the Governors and
Generals have nothing to do but to ſhow their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
if they have any. There's not one of 'em
who has any fear of God, or reſpect for his Prince,
that will pretend to ſhew any ſuch Commiſſion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Vice-Roy <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> and <hi>Don Sebaſtian
Ramire</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cuenza;</hi> all the reſt that have made
War on the <hi>Indians,</hi> are Thieves, and Robbers, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
and declar'd Enemies of Mankind. Seeing
then the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have had no lawful reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
their Declarations of War againſt the People
of <hi>America,</hi> nor have bin authoriz'd in ſuch Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
by their Prince, it evidently follows that the
War they have made is injuſt, and contrary to the
Laws of God and Men, and conſequently that the
<hi>Indians</hi> ought not to have bin treated as Slaves.</p>
                              <p>All the ways the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have us'd to compaſs
this end of inſlaving theſe People, have bin mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly
wicked, made up of nothing but Fraud and
Treachery, unlawful Tricks and Artifices, and ſuch
unheard of Villanies as can't but fill the Minds of all
that hear 'em with aſtoniſhment and horror. Some
to inſnare the poor <hi>Indians</hi> that liv'd among 'em,
have conſtrain'd 'em to own themſelves their Slaves
in Courts of Juſtice: after which extorted Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
the Governors have order'd the King's Arms
to be fix'd upon their Skin with a hot Iron; tho they
were not ignorant what an unlawful Courſe had been
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57864:91"/>
taken to abuſe the poor Creatures. Others hir'd the
<hi>Indians</hi> with a little Wine, or a Shirt, or by giving
'em ſome other trifle of ſmall value, to bring 'em fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs
and motherleſs Children, whom they put on
Shipboard, and tranſported into other Countries,
where they were ſold for Slaves, eſpecially into <hi>New-Spain,</hi>
the Iſlands of St. <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Cuba,</hi> or other
neighbouring Iſlands. But at firſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
us'd open Violence, attacking the <hi>Indians</hi> that liv'd
peaceably in their Houſes, ſetting their Towns on
fire, maſſacring ſome, and after the exerciſe of all
this Cruelty, carrying away thoſe they could take
alive to ſell 'em for Slaves. They us'd without any
formal proceſs, to brand 'em with the King's Arms;
which was enough to make 'em paſs for Slaves; and
accordingly they were ſold from one hand to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
till they were tranſported into the Iſlands.
Theſe were all the forms of Juſtice the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
in carrying away the <hi>Indians</hi> from the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
into the Iſlands of <hi>New-Spain,</hi> the Iſles of <hi>Cuba</hi>
and St. <hi>John,</hi> the Coaſt of <hi>Pearls, Yucatan</hi> and <hi>Panu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co.</hi>
And by theſe execrable Artifices they have ſince
carried away vaſt multitudes of People of every
Age, Sex, and Condition, from the Kingdoms of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuéla,
Guatimala,</hi> and <hi>Nicaraqua,</hi> to fell 'em in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama,</hi>
and in <hi>Peru.</hi> They once put 4 or 500 of 'em
in one Ship, the greateſt part of whom died in their
paſſage for want of Food, the Allowance given 'em
being ſo very ſmall.</p>
                              <p>At a Town conſiſting of about 200 people, the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> would require the <hi>Cacyque</hi> to ſend 'em
300 <hi>Indians</hi> at ſuch a certain day and hour, to carry
their Proviſions, and work for 'em. The poor
<hi>Cacyque</hi> was mightily concern'd he could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
this Order, not having People enough in the
whole Town; and not knowing what to do in the
caſe, deſired to have a day or two more allow'd him:
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57864:92"/>
But theſe Brutes would interpret this delay as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
breach of their Orders; and immediately ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
leave of the Governor to go and fall upon 'em,
would attaque 'em in their houſes, cutting the
throats of many of 'em in a barbarous manner, and
carrying away the reſt as Priſoners of War, whom
they inſlav'd contrary to all Law and Equity. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they would order a <hi>Cacyque</hi> to ſend 'em half
a hundred men to labour for 'em, and would ſet
'em to what work they thought good, after which
they would embark 'em in Ships and carry 'em away;
and ſometimes would mark 'em with the Letters of
their own Names without fixing the King's Arms
on 'em. When they were angry with 'em, they
would load 'em with Chains, and make 'em carry
heavy Burdens beſide, for 100 or 200 Leagues. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they had us'd 'em in what Drudgery they pleas'd,
they would ſell 'em, tho the <hi>Indians</hi> are as freeborn
as any other Nation. By this means the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
have unpeopled the Province of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> which
is ſituate between <hi>Guatimala</hi> and <hi>Nicaraqua.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>When they formerly advanc'd far into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to make further Diſcoveries of the <hi>Indians</hi> that
liv'd there, theſe good-natur'd People came to meet
'em loaded with Turkeys, and other Proviſions,
which they freely offer'd 'em, but for their kindneſſ
were either hew'd in pieces, or leſe made Slaves,
on pretence they were found in Arms in the Fields.
Nor could the Governors be ignorant of theſe
Violences and Diſorders or the Soldiers, ſince them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
had the beſt ſhare of the Spoil.</p>
                              <p>When they had divided thoſe Countries among
themſelves, which they had ſo unjuſtly uſurp'd, and
render'd themſelves the abſolute Maſters of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
as if they had coquer'd 'em in a juſt and
lawful War, they oblig'd the <hi>Caciques</hi> and natural
Princes of thoſe People to bring 'em ſuch a Sum of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57864:92"/>
Gold as they were pleas'd to command 'em. If they
had not ſuch a quantity, they told the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
they would willingly give 'em all they had to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
'em; but receiv'd a ſevere reply from theſe
cruel Men in ſuch terms as theſe: <hi>If you don't bring
us all the Gold we demand within ſuch a time, we'll ſet fire
to all your houſes.</hi> The poor <hi>Cacyques</hi> would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
make ſuch a return as this in a lamentable
Tone: <hi>Indeed our Country has no great ſtore of Gold in
it; and beſides, we have not bin curious to ſearch for
Mines.</hi> Upon ſuch an Account as this the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
have faſten'd 200 Stakes at a time in the ground,
and tied the poor Wretches to 'em with terrible
Menaces, and then let looſe thoſe ravenous Dogs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
'em, that us'd to be fed with human fleſh. It
may be the <hi>Cacique</hi> would be ſo terrified with ſuch
a horrible Spectacle as this, that he'd go among his
Subjects, and take Children out of every Family,
and give 'em to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for Slaves to pacify
'em. If there were but 2 Children in a houſe, one of
'em was taken away, and that muſt be the ſtrongeſt
and likelieſt to do ſervice. When the <hi>Cacique</hi> had
got together ſuch a number of his People as the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
requir'd, he would come to preſent 'em to them
himſelf. And it was a moſt lamentable thing to
hear the Sighs and Crys of Parents, when their dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Children were raviſh'd from 'em, to be tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into remote Countrys for Slaves. When theſe
Children were brought to the Governor to be brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would order the <hi>Caciques</hi> to engage
the <hi>Indians</hi> to teſtify that they were Slaves, and
the Children of Slaves, and that they were bought
in the Market; and would threaten to burn 'em,
unleſs they would ſtand to ſuch Lies as theſe. And
when the Perſon appointed to examin them, who
was well acquainted with all theſe Tricks, would
ask the Children of what Country they were; they
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57864:93"/>
made 'em anſwer, that they were Slaves, and that
their Parents were ſo, and that they were bought in
ſuch a Market. After this Examination they were
mark'd with the King's Stamp. His Majeſty's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
and Officers are very well acquainted with
all this Roguery of the Soldiers, and have had
too great a hand in the invention of theſe Artifices,
as appears by their having the largeſt ſhare of the
Booty.</p>
                              <p>When the Miſſionary Monks had got a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Indians</hi> together in their Church to inſtruct
'em in the knowledg of the true God, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
would ſuddenly come upon 'em with their
Swords in their hands, and take what number of
'em they thought meet; which could not but much
ſcandalize the reſt, and extremely griev'd the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries,
who were only told by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that
they wanted Men to carry their Baggage and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and ſo were forc'd to take all patiently. When
they had thus ſeiz'd the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> they ſet their
mark upon 'em, and ſold 'em for Slaves.</p>
                              <p>The Governors at firſt ſeldom refus'd any that
ask'd leave to plunder the <hi>Indians,</hi> and ruin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polulate
the Country. This was a kind of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
they gave 'em for the great Services they had
render'd the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> But afterwards they
took a Courſe that did not ſeem ſo diſhoneſt and
cruel, but was equally pernicious to the People of
the New World, which was to buy Slaves of the
<hi>Caciques,</hi> threatning 'em to burn 'em alive if they
did not furniſh 'em with ſuch a number as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
for which they would only give 'em a
Shirt or ſome ſuch Trifle; ſo that the poor <hi>Caciques</hi>
became themſelves the ruin of their own Country
for fear of being burnt, and made it their buſineſs
to go among their Subjects to gather great numbers
of Slaves together, to ſasisfy the Avarice of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi>
                                 <pb n="167" facs="tcp:57864:93"/>
At laſt they would make the <hi>Caciques</hi> pay
'em this tribute with other People; ſo that they
were conſtrain'd to go to ſome of the neighbouring
<hi>Caciques,</hi> and would make their Complaint to 'em
after this manner: <hi>Theſe Tyrant threaten me</hi> (would
one ſay) <hi>to cut my throat if I don't furniſh 'em with
ſuch a number of</hi> Indians <hi>for Slaves, and they won't
ſuffer me to chuſe out ſome of my own Subjects for 'em;
therefore I deſire the liberty to take ſome of yours, and
you ſhall have as many of mine for 'em. I am content</hi>
(would the other ſay) <hi>and the rather becauſe I my
ſelf am oblig'd to pay ſuch a Tribute as you are, and to
ſeek for Slaves out of my own Country to ſatisfy the</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.
The <hi>Caciques</hi> themſelves were wont to bring
theſe poor Slaves to be mark'd, and were made to
ſwear they were none of their Subjects, but that they
had taken 'em among their Neighbors; which was
true, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were never the leſs guilty in
conſtraining 'em ſo to do. The Governors that knew
their injuſtice and roguery, wink'd at it, and would
never accuſe any of 'em of theſe prevarications be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Judges of the Royal Council; for they
made it no part of their care to perform their Duty
to God and the King faithfully; nor did they ſeem
to be touch'd with the leaſt Compaſſion in obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the violence committed againſt thoſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
People.</p>
                              <p>I could produce a multitude of proofs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
what I ſay, but one ſhall ſuffice at preſent.
There came an Order from the King to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of the Province of <hi>Nicaraqua,</hi> to forbid him to
inſlave any <hi>Indians,</hi> or to brand him with the King's
Arms: at the ſame time there was a Ship in the
Road that was deſign'd to be fill'd with Slaves;
which made the Governor forbear to publiſh the
Order he had receiv'd, till the Veſſel was laden
with <hi>Indians,</hi> and ready to ſet ſail; nay he privately
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57864:94"/>
gave notice to thoſe that were concern'd in the Ship,
to make what haſte they could, and carry away as
many Slaves as they needed, becauſe the King had
ſent an expreſs Prohibition to hinder any from being
inſlaved for the future.</p>
                              <p>It was once matter of Aſtoniſhment to ſee the
fruitfulneſs, plenty and multitude of Inhabitants, that
fill'd the Province of <hi>Honduras;</hi> and 'tis now as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
to behold the Miſery, Deſolation, and
want to People there, which reſemble it to a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Wilderneſs. The Governor of this Province
made uſe of a trick not much unlike that of which
we have been ſpeaking. He ow'd a great Sum of
Mony to ſome Merchants for Wine and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
he had bought of 'em; who had their
Veſſels in the Port, and expected this Governor to
pay 'em in Slaves. But the Emperor's Order forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him to make any Slaves in this Province being
very ſtrict, he durſt not take up <hi>Indians</hi> publicly to pay
his debts, for fear of provoking the Emperor by acting
directly againſt his Command: He therefore ſent out
two of his Captains, one to the Sea-Coaſt, and the
other farther up into the Continent, with Orders to
take up ſuch <hi>Indians</hi> as were likely to make the leaſt
noiſe and diſturbance by their Complaints; theſe he
order'd to be embarqued, and to prevent to himſelf
any danger from the Court, he pretended theſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
were ſeditious Perſons and Malefactors, whom
he was oblig'd to baniſh, becauſe it would have been
of ill conſequence to have let 'em remain in their
Country: This was the Pretext under which he ſold
'em for Slaves to pay his Debts. And with this ſort
of Coin the <hi>Spaniards</hi> us'd to buy all ſorts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
that came from <hi>Europe,</hi> and whatever elſe
they thought neceſſary. So that 'tis no wonder
that thoſe fine and rich Provinces are become for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn
Deſerts, ſince this Trade of buying and ſelling
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57864:94"/>
Slaves has been allow'd, which was firſt practis'd in
<hi>Hiſpaniola.</hi> Sometimes the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to deceive the
<hi>Indians</hi> would perſwade 'em they ſhould go with
them into <hi>Spain,</hi> when they deſign'd only to carry
'em to the Iſle of <hi>Cuba,</hi> and ſell 'em there. And
there are many ſtill at <hi>Havana,</hi> that were taken af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner; for when other <hi>Spaniards</hi> heard of
the Stratagems their Countrymen us'd to impoſe on
the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> they would uſe the ſame Tricks,
and brag of 'em inſtead of being aſham'd; ſo that
the World has been ſufficiently inform'd of theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices.
The Miſeries and Deſolations of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Nicaraqua</hi> and <hi>Guatimala,</hi> of the greateſt part of
<hi>Mexico, Tabeſco,</hi> and <hi>Panuco,</hi> are inconteſtible Proofs
of the Cruelties and other Crimes of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
The Archbiſhop of <hi>Mexico</hi> wrote an Account of 'em
by way of complaint to the Royal Council for the
<hi>Indies,</hi> wherein he inform'd 'em that the Governor
had loaded twenty eight Ships with Slaves. The
Governor of the Province of <hi>Xaliſco</hi> took for his
own Share 4560 Slaves, Men, Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
ſome of whom were but one, others two or
three years old; all was fiſh that came to net; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
an infinit number that other <hi>Spaniards</hi> took in
this Province, againſt the King's expreſs Orders,
who was much diſpleas'd that thoſe People ſhould
be inſlav'd, who ought to have bin inſtructed in the
knowledge of the true God, and of the Chriſtian
Religion, in order to their Salvation. Thoſe Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
Merchants that got poſſeſſion of the Kingdom
of <hi>Vençuela,</hi> to pillage and deſtroy it, made horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Spoil there for the ſpace of twenty years. That
all I ſay is the very Truth, may better appear
by conſulting the Archives of the Royal Council,
which are full of complaints againſt the inſidious
Contrivances of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the great Violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they have committed to enſlave the poor <hi>Indians.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="170" facs="tcp:57864:95"/>
Theſe poor Wretches have no body to interceed
for 'em, or to protect 'em; and are always in great
conſternation, becauſe continually expos'd to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
of their Enemies, who oppreſs 'em without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
call'd to account for it. So that they deſpair of
relief, not knowing to whom to addreſs themſelves
for juſtice.</p>
                              <p>Now ſeeing the Artifices that have bin us'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave
theſe poor Creatures, are ſo unjuſt and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
and ſeeing theſe People as well as others are
born free, it follows that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have acted
contrary to the Law of Nations, in inſlaving all thoſe
<hi>Indians</hi> whom they have taken for that end ever
ſince the Diſcovery of the New World, and have
by their Violences evidently tranſgreſs'd the Law of
God and Nature.</p>
                              <p>To prove yet farther that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to reſtore thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> their Liberty, whom
they yet detain in bondage, there's only need of
making one reflection, namely, that the Law of God
obliges us to make reſtitution of every thing we
have taken unjuſtly from our Neighbours, and to
make reparation for the injuries done 'em; and
without doing thus 'tis impoſſible to be ſav'd. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Principle 'tis evident, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
ought to releaſe their <hi>Indians</hi> Slaves, and to do what
in 'em lies to make 'em amends for the wrong they
have done 'em, againſt all Law and Equity; for 'tis
not to be ſuppos'd the ſin will be forgiven, till
what has bin unjuſtly taken away is reſtor'd; and
conſequently the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who have treated the
poor <hi>Indians</hi> after ſo ill a manner, and yet don't go
about to make 'em ſatisfaction, are under the guilt
of a mortal Sin.</p>
                              <p>To make this appear yet more evidently, two
things muſt be ſuppos'd. Firſt, that there were no
Slaves in <hi>New Spain,</hi> on the Borders of which there
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57864:95"/>
dwelt divers Nations, eſpecially the <hi>Mexicans,</hi> that
are more dexterous and politic than other <hi>Indians:</hi>
This every one knows who is acquainted with
the new World. Secondly, That the term <hi>Slave</hi>
does not ſignify the ſame thing among the <hi>Indians</hi> as
among the <hi>Europeans,</hi> but only denotes a Servant
with the former, or one that has ſome particular
obligation to aſſiſt us in our neceſſary Affairs; ſo
that to be the Slave of an <hi>Indian,</hi> is to be but one
degree below his Son; 'tis to dwell in his Houſe, to
take care of his Goods and Silver, to wait on his
Wife and Children, which is conſiſtent with the
enjoyment of his Liberty: He ſets the Houſe in
order, ſows the Land, and does any neceſſary work,
as occaſion requires. And his Maſter on his part
treats him with a great deal of Kindneſs and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
as if he were not oblig'd to render him this
Service. Thoſe Miſſionaries that have learn'd the
<hi>Indian</hi> Language, and know the import of their
words, can teſtify the truth of what I ſay.</p>
                              <p>It is farther to be ſuppos'd, that in <hi>New Spain</hi> and
<hi>Mexico</hi> many unlawful ways have bin us'd by the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> to inſlave the <hi>Indians,</hi> in ſo much that one
would have thought they knew nothing of the true
God, nor had ever heard of the Precepts of the
Goſpel. When there was a Famin there, which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
happens in thoſe rich and fertil Countries,
thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> that had a ſtock of Corn, perſwaded
them that were poor to ſell 'em their Children for
ſome of their Corn: with this propoſal they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
very willingly, becauſe their Servitude is ſo
eaſy, their Slaves not being oblig'd to any very hard
Labor. And the <hi>Indians</hi> are naturally obſequious and
ſubmiſſive to thoſe on whom they depend; they
would give one of their Children for five Buſhels of
Corn, and this was the ordinary Price they gave.
'Tis true, this was an unjuſt method of making
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57864:96"/>
Slaves, becauſe all things ought to be common in a
time of extreme Neceſſity; for the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
obliges us freely to give or lend to thoſe that
are under preſſing want.</p>
                              <p>Another occaſion on which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made
the <hi>Indians</hi> their Slaves was this; when any one had
found an <hi>Indian</hi> with ſome Ears of Corn which he
had ſtolen, he had Authority to make him his Slave.
The Miſſionaries have obſerv'd that ſome of 'em
would maliciouſly ſcatter Ears of Corn in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
that they might ſeize thoſe for Slaves that
had innocently gather'd 'em up. Beſides this, the
Parents and Relations of him that had the Corn
found upon him were made Slaves for this imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Theft, which is a very unjuſt and criminal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice.
They likewiſe had invented a ſort of Play
among 'em, in which he that loſt was made a Slave;
the beſt Players would make as if they knew not
how to play, to inſnare thoſe that were ignorant
into their Service. If any one whom they had thus
caught, preſum'd to run away, his neareſt Relations
were forc'd to ſupply his place. When a Free-man
had lain with a Woman that was a Slave, her Maſter
had power to ſeize him, or his Wife, if he were
married, and to oblige him to ſerve him till ſhe was
brought to bed. Which Cuſtom obtain'd through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Country. He that had a young Maid to
his Slave, would inſlave any one that lay with her,
which was attended with great Inconveniences;
for the Maſters of theſe young She-ſlaves would put
'em upon enticing Men to lie with 'em, on purpoſe
to catch 'em in this Trap. If a Slave took any thing
out of his Maſter's Houſe to give it to his Relations,
they all immediately became his Maſter's Slaves.
When ſeveral Merchants went into other Countries
for Slaves to ſell in <hi>New Spain,</hi> where they had the
beſt trade for 'em, they lent thoſe that were poor
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57864:96"/>
their Goods and Corn upon Uſury; and when they
were not in a condition to pay for what they had
bought, they ſeiz'd 'em for Slaves. If he that ow'd
the Sum, died before the Debt was diſcharg'd, and
his Wife and Children were not capable of paying
the Creditor, they became his Slaves. In time of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,
Parents would ſell one of their Children to ſerve
a Maſter for a certain number of years; but indeed
there was no end of this Servitude, for if the Maſter
dy'd, his Relations would take poſſeſſion of his Slave.
But the Biſhop of <hi>Mexico,</hi> who is a very pious and
virtuous Prelat, has written an account in Latin of
all the Tricks the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have us'd to inſlave the
<hi>Indians;</hi> by which 'tis eaſy to ſee with how much
Injuſtice they have abus'd the Simplicity and Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of theſe poor wretches to reduce 'em to a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ſtate of Bondage.</p>
                              <p>From what I have been relating it appears, that
the <hi>Indians</hi> being Idolaters, and deſtitute of the
knowledg of the true God, and the Rules of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity,
don't regulate their Actions by ſuch Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
as the fear of Hell, and the deſire of Heaven,
and the hope of having their good Works rewarded
hereafter: Therefore they are vicious and corrupt
in many reſpects; for inſtance, they don't obſerve
the Law of Nations in the Wars they make one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another; by which one may well gueſs there are
many other injuſt things done among 'em.</p>
                              <p>But the Faith of Chriſt, and the Precepts of the
Goſpel are for preſerving only good Laws and
Cuſtoms, and for aboliſhing thoſe that are bad, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſuch as are oppoſite to the Law of Nature,
and prejudicial to Human Society. Therefore thoſe
<hi>Indians</hi> that are converted, who have bin guilty of
Polygamy, are oblig'd to put away all their Wives
but one, according to the preſcription of the Law
of God, as well as to reſtore all the Goods they
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57864:97"/>
have gotten by unlawful ways of Robbery or Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If Chriſtians follow the evil Cuſtoms of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,
or tolerate 'em when they can hinder 'em,
they manifeſtly render themſelves Accomplices in
the Crimes of thoſe Idolaters, becauſe we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
by the Divine Law to abſtain from ſuch Actions
as may occaſion Scandal, or any way injure the
temporal or ſpiritual Welfare of our Neighbor.
For this reaſon St. <hi>Paul</hi> commanded Chriſtians not
to eat things offer'd to Idols, leſt it ſhould be
thought they approv'd of thoſe damnable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices;
tho they might eat of thoſe very meats, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
the Pagans did not ſee 'em, and ſo were not
ſcandaliz'd by the Action.</p>
                              <p>All Chriſtians are oblig'd by the Divine Word
to do what in 'em lies for the Abolition of ſinful
Cuſtoms, or at leaſt to abſtain from 'em, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve
'em themſelves. And when a man doubts
whether any Action he is about to do is juſt or injuſt,
he can't do it with a good Conſcience: this is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Rule that admits of no exception, becauſe
Chriſtians are oblig'd by the Doctrin of the Goſpel,
rather to loſe all they have than to commit the leaſt
Sin. Therefore while the Mind heſitates and doubts,
whether the Action on which one thinks be ſin or
no, we ought neceſſarily to abſtain from it. The
very deſire of doing ſuch an Action is contrary to
right Reaſon, and to the Love of God; becauſe it
would be to expoſe one's ſelf to the hazard of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing
the Divine Will, to do that concerning
which one labors under an uncertainty whether it
be lawful or forbidden. And the Doubt, when one
thus ventures to ſin, is no longer a mere Doubt,
but moſt certainly becomes an Offence againſt God,
becauſe we are always oblig'd to take the ſafeſt
courſe. When it falls out that we meet with two
ways, and are uncertain which is the right, we
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57864:97"/>
ought always to chuſe that which is the leaſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
according to that Maxim of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>
in his penitential Book, <hi>Take what is certain, and
leave what is uncertain.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The Rules of the Civil Law, which are confirm'd
by Reaſon, by the Law of Nature, and that of
Chriſtian Charity, admit of a Diſpenſation in ſome
caſes, when there is a proſpect of ſome great Good,
to which a greater ſtrictneſs would probably be
prejudicial. But 'tis a general Rule, that when a
Man deliberates on two doubtful things, he is to
determin his choice on that ſide where he may avoid
Sin, where there are the feweſt Inconveniences,
and where his Neighbour's Intereſt runs the leaſt
hazard. Upon this Principle, Clergy-men ought
not to be oblig'd to retire and live ſeparatly from
their Mothers, Grandmothers or Siſters, or to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
their Father's Houſe; becauſe ſuch a Separation
may be very diſadvantagious to 'em, tho there may
poſſibly be ſome Inconvenience likewiſe in their
dwelling together.</p>
                              <p>That man retains a thing with an evil Conſcience,
about which he is in doubt whether it be lawfully
gotten, or which he has receiv'd of one who had
no right to it, or who had reaſon to doubt whether
it belong'd to him or no. Whatever is poſſeſs'd
under ſuch circumſtances, is kept contrary to the
Rules of Juſtice, and againſt both the Law of God
and Nature. Therefore the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who keep
thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> in ſlavery, concerning whom they are
in doubt whether they have bin bought, or given
to thoſe of whom they had 'em, act contrary to
Juſtice and to the Law of God, in retaining 'em
while under this doubt. Every one knows that a
man is oblig'd to reſtore whatever he does not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
poſſeſs, and whatever he has receiv'd from one
that had no juſt right to it, becauſe a man can't
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57864:98"/>
communicate a right to another which he has not
firſt himſelf. Thus when any one buys or receives
any thing from a Perſon who ſells or gives it, and
yet has no right to it, he is unjuſt if he keeps it,
and is oblig'd to make reſtitution. The Reaſon is
evident, becauſe 'tis no leſs than the commiſſion of
Theft, wilfully to retain any thing againſt the will
of him to whom it appertains. And tho this thing
ſhould have paſt through a thouſand hands before it
came to you, you would have no right to withold
it from the proper Owner, becauſe theſe were all
unlawful Poſſeſſors, and conſequently ought to have
made reſtitution. And tho ſome human Laws give
permiſſion to retain a thing which one has bought
with Mony that is coin'd with the King's ſtamp, and
is current in the Commonwealth, yet this is no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Title to it, becauſe human Laws muſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
contrary to the Law of God and Nature, nor
to good Morals, which forbid Theft, and the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olding
of another man's Goods againſt the conſent of
the rightful Owner. Inferiors, and ſuch are Kings
themſelves in reſpect of the Divine Majeſty, can't
juſtly eſtabliſh any thing in prejudice to the Law of
God, which is ſuperior to all other Laws.</p>
                              <p>He that buys ſtolen Goods knowingly, is an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory
in the Robbery: and if he does but ſuſpect
they are ſtolen, and has not bin ſo diligent as he
might have bin, to inform himſelf whether they
were lawfully gotten, he can't keep 'em with a good
Conſcience; becauſe no man can innocently do that
which expoſes him to Sin. And if we will not take
the pains to inform our ſelves whether that which
is ſold or given to us be lawfully gotten, when we
are in doubt about it, we can't be the lawful Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors,
becauſe this is a culpable and wilful Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
Thoſe who have in ſuch caſes conſulted Men
capable of giving information, are excuſable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57864:98"/>
themſelves be of ſuch a Character as obliges
'em to be acquainted with Law and Equity, as Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians,
Judges, and the like; or when they ask ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
content themſelves with conſulting only one
Perſon, tho they have opportunity of adviſing with
many; or ask counſel of intereſted Perſons, and ſuch
as will not anſwer according to the Dictates of their
Conſcience, inſtead of conſulting Men of Integrity
who will give advice according to the Rules of Law
and Equity; or when they addreſs themſelves to
Perſons whoſe Honeſty is ſuſpected upon good
grounds. A Man is not excuſable under ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
as theſe, tho he ask Counſel of the
Learned in the Law; and after having taken their
Advice, acts contrary to Right and Equity. Theſe
four Circumſtances being regarded, may be of great
uſe to eaſe ſcrupulous perſons of their doubts, and
to give 'em peace of Conſcience.</p>
                              <p>And by theſe Principles it may be eaſily known
that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> unjuſtly retain moſt of their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Slaves againſt the Law of God: and if they
have a right to any of 'em, the number is very ſmall,
and they have reaſon to doubt whether theſe have
been lawfully made Slaves; becauſe thoſe they have
had from the <hi>Indians</hi> have been brought to 'em as
a Tribute extorted from 'em againſt their will, by
Fear, Menaces and Torments; ſo that they have no
juſt Title to 'em: or if they have bought 'em of
<hi>Indians,</hi> they have us'd unfair tricks to procure 'em,
having terrified the <hi>Caciques,</hi> and conſtrain'd 'em
by Tortures to deliver up their Subjects into their
hands, threatning otherwiſe to acuſe 'em to the
Judges for worſhipping and offering Sacrifices to
Idols; ſo that the poor <hi>Caciques</hi> when they could
not give the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as many <hi>Indians</hi> as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
us'd to ſteal 'em where they could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'Tis
true, when theſe Diſorders came to be known to his
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57864:99"/>
Majeſty, he expreſly forbad any ſuch ways of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving
the People for the future.</p>
                              <p>As for thoſe few Slaves which the <hi>Indians</hi> have
voluntarily ſold, tho the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have hitherto
made no queſtion that they had a lawful right to
'em, they have had however reaſon enough to doubt
it, and they ought by no means to have taken
poſſeſſion of 'em, till they had firſt us'd all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
diligence to get information whether they might
do it with a good Conſcience; and if after all their
inquiry the matter remain'd dubious, they ought
not to have bought 'em while under that ſcruple:
So that all the ways they have taken to procure
themſelves great numbers of Slaves are unlawful:
And when the <hi>Indian</hi> Princes ſaw how eagerly the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> purſu'd this trade, they would tyrannize
over their Subjects, and force 'em to become Slaves,
that they might be capable of anſwering the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
demands, and of buying the trifles they ſold 'em.
The Judges of the Royal Council, who have ſounded
this matter to the bottom, have declar'd, that ſcarce
any of the <hi>Indians</hi> have been lawfully inſlav'd, and
on this account have ſet many of 'em at liberty.</p>
                              <p>The Miſſionary Monks who underſtood the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and were acquainted with
their Secrets, have declar'd, that thoſe who have
kept 'em as their Slaves, have done ſo without any
juſt ground: and they had no intereſt to ſpeak after
this manner, being only concern'd about the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Souls.</p>
                              <p>And can it be thought that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of what themſelves had done, who made
themſelves formidable to the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> and forc'd
'em by ſevere Puniſhment to procure 'em what
Slaves they requir'd? And theſe ignorant Infidels,
who have ſo little of the fear or love of God, might
eaſily perſwade themſelves that there was no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57864:99"/>
in doing what they ſaw Chriſtians do before
'em; ſo that their ill Examples might well embolden
'em to ſteal away fatherleſs Children, to trepan the
ignorant, and even to make uſe of force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to get Slaves to ſell to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> For
after this manner have the <hi>Indians</hi> been corrupted
and induc'd to commit all kinds of Injuſtice againſt
their own Country-men to procure Slaves, ſince
they have had Converſation with the Chriſtians,
who incouraged 'em in theſe Tricks, not only by
their Words, but likewiſe by their Example. And
'tis moſt certain, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of theſe unrighteous Proceedings, ſince them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
were the occaſion and inſtruments of all this
Miſchief: and it muſt at leaſt be granted, that they
were oblig'd to ſuſpect whether the Slaves that were
brought 'em were taken as lawful Priſoners of War,
and to inquire whether they might keep 'em with a
good Conſcience or not.</p>
                              <p>They drove this trade with ſuſpicious Perſons,
and therefore might well have preſum'd that they
offended the Rules of Juſtice; and that thoſe that
gave or ſold theſe Slaves to 'em, had no right ſo to
do. Men ought to be very cautious how they deal
with the <hi>Indians,</hi> leſt they approve of the Theft and
other Crimes of theſe Infidels. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> knew
well enough what was commonly reported of the
<hi>Indians</hi> every where, that they us'd many unjuſt and
tyrannical ways to get Slaves on all ſides; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought to have ſcrupled the buying of 'em ſuch
as were naturally free, and who had bin inſlav'd
againſt the Law of Nations: So that they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
excuſe themſelves from poſſeſſing 'em unjuſtly,
and from participating of the Crimes of the <hi>Indians</hi>
in ſtealing and captivating great numbers of People.
Among a hundred thouſand Slaves whom the <hi>Indians</hi>
have ſold to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or paid 'em by way of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57864:100"/>
Tribute, perhaps not one of 'em was properly a
Slave, or taken in a juſt and lawful War. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
ſome of 'em to be ſo, how could they be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd
from the reſt in this vaſt number? Beſides,
that there is a great difference, as we have already
obſerv'd, between the Slaves of the <hi>Indians</hi> and
thoſe of the <hi>Europeans:</hi> The former make Slavery
not very uneaſy or troubleſom, their Slaves being
in a manner free, and not much differing from their
Children; whereas Slavery among the <hi>Spaniards</hi> is a
moſt terrible condition, and thoſe that are ſubjected
to it, enjoy no Favor, Comfort or Reſt, but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
expos'd to Hunger and Thirſt, and other
ſevere Puniſhments: Nor are there any Laws or
Statutes that can ſoften the cruel Temper of the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> and hinder 'em from exacting of their
Slaves ſuch Service as ſurpaſſes human Strength.</p>
                              <p>From all the Principles we have been eſtabliſhing,
it follows, Firſt, that his Majeſty is oblig'd by the
Law of God to ſet all thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> at liberty,
whom the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have made their Slaves, and
unjuſtly retain as ſuch. Firſt, Becauſe his Majeſty
is oblig'd to do Juſtice to all the World, to great
and ſmall, without reſpect of Perſons, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing
the Cauſe of the miſerable and afflicted, who
are not in a condition to defend themſelves, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
their own Grievances. 'Tis the principal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Kings to execute Juſtice, and protect the
weak againſt the oppreſſion of the ſtrong; and
when they fail in this, they ſometimes draw down
the Divine Vengeance on their own Perſons and
Kingdoms; becauſe the Cries of the poor, and ſuch
as labor under Miſery, inceſſantly go up to the
Throne of God. And ſince the <hi>Spaniards</hi> unjuſtly
oppreſs the <hi>Indians,</hi> who have no way to ſecure
themſelves from the Violence and Tyranny of their
Perſecutors; 'tis evident his Majeſty is oblig'd to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57864:100"/>
ſtop the courſe of their Injuſtice, and to reſtore
thoſe poor People their Liberty who groan under
ſo cruel a Bondage. Nor ought this to be one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
deferr'd, ſeeing theſe Vexations are publick
and notorious, and his Majeſty cannot be ignorant
of 'em.</p>
                              <p>Thoſe Kings that are willing to obſerve the ſtrict
Rules of Juſtice, whether Pagans or Chriſtians, ought
to uſe their utmoſt Efforts to keep their Subjects in
peace, tho at the ſame time they ſhould forget no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that may conduce to lead 'em in the way of
Virtue; becauſe the end that every Governor of a
Commonwealth ought to propoſe to himſelf is, to
act ſo as to render all his Subjects virtuous. How
much more are Catholic Princes, who profeſs to
follow the Rules of Chriſt, oblig'd to govern their
Subjects according to his Precepts, and to remove
all the Obſtacles that are likely to turn 'em out of
the way of Truth? In which Enterprize they cannot
ſucceed without giving 'em good and equal Laws,
and obliging 'em to an exact obſervance of 'em.</p>
                              <p>Chriſtian Princes are moreover bound to exhort
their Subjects to ſerve the true God, and to yield
obedience to the Doctrin of Chriſt, as much as
poſſibly they can. And ſeeing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
retaining the <hi>Indians</hi> in ſlavery, are continually
in the habit of a mortal Sin, and conſequently don't
live according to the Laws of Chriſt, our Kings
ought to command 'em to releaſe all the <hi>Indians,</hi>
that they may remove this great Obſtacle which lies
in the way of their Subjects Salvation. The Royal
Character of Princes obliges 'em to make Laws and
Regulations, that Juſtice may be maintain'd, and
the People ſubject to their Government preſerv'd
in the practice of Virtue; and are likewiſe requir'd
by the Divine Law to employ their temporal Power
for the augmentation of the Catholic Church, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57864:101"/>
the maintenance of Eccleſiaſtical Diſciplin, that the
Profeſſors of Chriſtianity may not rebel againſt the
Miniſters of Chriſt. In this they may lawfully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
the terror of their Arms, to keep all People
to their Duty; for otherwiſe Temporal Powers
would not be neceſſary for the adminiſtration of the
Affairs of the Church. From hence it may fairly
be concluded, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ought to uſe
his power to render Juſtice to the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> who
are ſo tyrannically oppreſs'd, and to ſtrengthen the
hands of the Miniſters of the Church in the <hi>Indies</hi>
by his Authority, who are not able to make any
progreſs by their Miniſtry among the Natives, nor
to reclaim the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from their Vices, while they
are ſuffer'd to afflict and perſecute the poor <hi>Indians,</hi>
becauſe theſe continual Violences, and their fix'd
reſolution to perſiſt in 'em, are habitual Sins. At
preſent they regard not at all the Remonſtrances and
Menaces of Prelats, or Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, but
go on adding Sin to Sin, in ſo much that the Church
in the <hi>Indies</hi> is in a forlorn condition, and under
great difficulties: ſo that the <hi>Indians</hi> ought to be ſet
free, that the Obſtructions lying in the way of their
Salvation may be remov'd, and that they may the
better be engag'd to ſubmit to the Doctrin that is
preach'd to 'em: For by this means Chriſtian
Paſtors will have a full liberty to exerciſe their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
and to diſcharge their Apoſtolic Functions.</p>
                              <p>The Biſhops of <hi>America</hi> are oblig'd by the Law
of God continually to ſollicit his Majeſty and his
Royal Council to deliver the <hi>Indians</hi> from the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
under which they groan, and to give 'em
their former Liberty, becauſe theſe Biſhops are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
engag'd by their Character to do the beſt
they can for the diſcharge of their Paſtoral Office,
which conſiſts in governing and teaching the People
under their Conduct, and in providing for all their
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57864:101"/>
ſpiritual neceſſities; as alſo in ſecuring 'em as well as
they can from any temporal Injury, and in reſcuing
'em from the hands of Oppreſſors, eſpecially when
the Vexations they ſuffer are ſo many ſtumbling
blocks in the way of their Salvation. Nor ought
they to be wanting in procuring 'em all the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Advantages they can.</p>
                              <p>The Dominican and Franciſcan Friers are very pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and prudent, and deſerve to be highly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in that they have agreed to refuſe abſolution to
all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of <hi>New Spain,</hi> who keep <hi>Indian</hi>
Slaves, and to oblige 'em to bring this affair under
examination before the Royal Council, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to the Laws newly made; tho they would
have done better not to have had recourſe to this
Tribunal. Theſe Monks know very well by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
what unjuſt and deceitful Methods have been
us'd to inſlave the <hi>Indians,</hi> and can't doubt but God
has been highly offended by theſe Violences, and
that thoſe who have committed 'em are oblig'd to
repair the Injuries of which they have been guilty.
A Confeſſor who undertakes to hear Mens Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
one who officiates in quality of a Biſhop or
Curat as a ſpiritual Judg, ought to underſtand the
Obligations of his Miniſtry, and to have that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
and prudence which is requiſite to perform it
after a becoming manner, that he may paſs a wiſe
and juſt Judgment on all matters propos'd to him,
and rightly diſcern what wrong is offer'd to any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
Party. If his ignorance or negligence is the
cauſe of his Miſtake, ſo that he obliges not his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
to reſtore any ill-gotten goods, he commits a
great Sin, and is himſelf bound to make reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and amends for the Injuſtice done the offended
Party: Juſt as a Phyſician who has through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
done ſome conſiderable Miſchief to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
or occaſion'd his death, ought to make ſome
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57864:102"/>
ſpecial Reparation for his fault. The ſame may
be ſaid of Judges that paſs an unrighteous Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
while they are ignorant of the Law, or take
no care to inform themſelves of the merit of the
Cauſe before 'em, becauſe ſuch neglect and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
are criminal, and they ought to know the
matters on which they are intruſted to paſs a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                              <p>'Tis certain all the Eccleſiaſtical Perſons in <hi>New
Spain</hi> are well aſſur'd that the <hi>Indians</hi> have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlav'd,
and are ſtill kept in bondage, contrary to all
Law and Equity; and therefore are not oblig'd to
refer the Examination of this Affair to the Royal
Council: beſides, there are all ſorts of tricks and
devices uſed to divert the Council from taking cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
of the matter, leſt they ſhould ſuppreſs thoſe
vexatious Practices. His Majeſty ought with all
ſpeed to iſſue out his Orders for the releaſe of theſe
miſerable People, and ſo much the rather, becauſe
the oppreſſion they are under is the occaſion of the
ruin of an infinit number of Souls. And this is the
only way to reclaim the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from the habit of
a mortal Sin, and to put the Prelats in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
freely to acquit themſelves of their Eccleſiaſtical
Functions.</p>
                              <p>Among all the Expedients Frier <hi>Don Bartholomew
de Laſ-Caſas,</hi> Biſhop of the Royal City of <hi>Chiapa,</hi>
propos'd for the reeſtabliſhment of Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
in <hi>America,</hi> the moſt effectual was that of
directly ſubjecting all the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> to the Crown
of <hi>Spain,</hi> that ſo the Spaniſh Lords might be uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of making the <hi>Indians</hi> their own Subjects and
Vaſſals. And he ſupported this Propoſal with many
very cogent Reaſons.</p>
                              <p>Firſt he ſays, the Princes and People of the New
World being Infidels, and their Converſion to our
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57864:102"/>
holy Faith appearing neceſſary, 'tis very proper
they ſhould be under the Protection of a Catholic
and powerful King, who has a true zeal for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and propagation of the Chriſtian Religion, and
might ſend able Miſſionaries into the New World,
to bring thoſe Idolaters to the knowledg of the true
God, and to embrace our Divine Religion, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themſelves to the Holy See. And hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that nothing can be more advantageous to the
<hi>Indians,</hi> than to put themſelves under the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Catholic Princes, that no particular Lords
may be capable of taking poſſeſſion of 'em as their
Property. This is what the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> ought
to regard, without ſharing with any others that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Authority they have acquired over the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians;</hi>
for they ought to preſerve this Juriſdiction
immediately to themſelves, and not divide it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
private Men with it. And this is an Affair of
ſo great conſequence, that no leſs than both the
temporal and eternal Welfare of thoſe Nations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on it; for the Converſion of the New World
would be a very advantageous thing to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
                              <p>'Tis neither juſt nor poſſible to abandon this Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to private Perſons, ſince none but the King
can be inveſted with it; becauſe when the Pope has
once made choice of any Perſon or Power for this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
it ought not to be delegated or entruſted to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
When he has in this matter declar'd himſelf
in favor of any Perſon illuſtrious by his Character
and Merit, who has a perfect knowledg of any Cauſe
he may have to determin, 'tis to be preſum'd he'l
paſs ſuch a Judgment as the Pope himſelf would
have done. Now 'tis manifeſt that in the Caſe in
queſtion we have a Perſon cloth'd with Grandeur and
Dignity, ſeeing he is King of <hi>Spain,</hi> a very good
Chriſtian, and zealous for the Catholic Religion;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57864:103"/>
and the matter is of great importance, becauſe it
concerns the preaching and propagation of the true
Faith and Worſhip of God, the Converſion of nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Nations, and the Government of 'em; which
is to be adminiſtred with Lenity and Prudence,
that Juſtice may be maintain'd among 'em, and the
love of Virtue inſpir'd into 'em: which is an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
too great for any but Soveraign Princes to
perform.</p>
                              <p>'Tis certain the Holy See has choſen the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> to be entruſted with the Government of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi>
which may be prov'd by two conſiderable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.
The firſt of which is the Clauſe added
in the Commiſſion, <hi>We rely upon your Fidelity, Prudence
and Juſtice:</hi> which is inſerted in the Bull of Grant
and Commiſſion of the <hi>Indies</hi> to the moſt ſerene Kings
of <hi>Spain,</hi> wherein the Pope ſays in expreſs Terms;</p>
                              <p>
                                 <q>Knowing you to be Kings truly Catholic, as we
have been aſſur'd by many experiences, and that
your Piety is every where regarded throughout the
Chriſtian World, we doubt not but you will uſe
all the care and diligence you can for the Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Increaſe of the Catholic Faith; as you have
ſpar'd no charge or pains to reſcue the Kingdom
of <hi>Grenada</hi> from the hands of <hi>Sarazens</hi> and Infidels,
which has ſo much conduc'd to the Glory of the
name of God.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>The ſecond Circumſtance is, that when any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Order is added in the Commiſſion, the firſt
Clauſe of it is expreſs'd in theſe Words:</p>
                              <p>
                                 <q>We exhort you by your Holy Baptiſm, which
obliges you to ſubmit to our Apoſtolic Orders;
and we conjure you by the Bowels of Compaſſion
in Jeſus Chriſt, that you would generouſly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
this Expedition, to engage the People of the
New World to embrace the Chriſtian Religion:
nor let any Hardſhips or Perils diſcourage you, but
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57864:103"/>
put your truſt in God, who will make your Work
ſucceed to his Glory.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>The other Clauſe contains a kind of Command,
and is thus expreſs'd;</p>
                              <p>
                                 <q>We command you in virtue of the holy Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
you owe us; and we doubt not but you
will undertake this Affair with a great deal of
zeal and fervor, and ſend into the Iſlands and
Continent Men fearing God, able, experienc'd,
and capable of inſtructing the Inhabitants of the
New World in the Catholic Faith, and of inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
'em with the love of Virtue.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>Theſe Circumſtances make it ſufficiently appear,
that the Pope gave the charge of cauſing the <hi>Indians</hi>
to be inſtructed to the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the ſignal Services render'd the Church by
that Crown; nay, that he has oblig'd them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
this good work by his expreſs Command to
apply themſelves to it, in virtue of the holy Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
they owe him.</p>
                              <p>Purſuant to this theſe Princes ſolemnly engag'd
themſelves to ſecond the Pope's deſigns with all their
Power: Their Promiſe was turn'd into a Covenant,
and became a formal Obligation on 'em; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
'tis the indiſpenſible Duty of the Kings of
<hi>Spain</hi> to be the Miniſters of the Holy See in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word of God into the <hi>Indies,</hi> and contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all their Power to continue the work of convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Indians:</hi> Their care ſhould be extended to
their temporal as well as ſpiritual Concerns; and
they ought to neglect nothing that may be neceſſary
for their preſervation or converſion. Nor is it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for theſe Princes to abdicate this Authority, and
diveſt themſelves of this Juriſdiction.</p>
                              <p>Let your Majeſty therefore pleaſe to conſider ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
how ſtrict and indiſpenſible this Obligation
is; be pleas'd to remember that in the year 1499,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57864:104"/>
when <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus,</hi> the firſt Diſcoverer and
Admiral of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> had permitted each
<hi>Spaniard</hi> that accompanied him to take one <hi>Indians</hi> in
recompence of the great Services done the Crown
of <hi>Spain</hi> in that Voyage, when thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> arriv'd
in <hi>Spain,</hi> your Majeſty ſo much reſented it, that
'twas not eaſy to appeaſe your Anger on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Your Majeſty ask'd if the Admiral had power
to deſtroy your Subjects; and commanded the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
to ſend back to the <hi>Indies</hi> all the <hi>Indians</hi> they
had brought from thence on pain of Death. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
they return'd in the year 1500, when
<hi>Francis Bobadilla</hi> went to take the Government of the
New World.</p>
                              <p>The ſecond reaſon that proves your Majeſty under
an obligation to incorporate the <hi>Indies</hi> into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of your Crown, and not to ſuffer the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
in the leaſt to uſurp any thing in quality of
Lords and Maſters, is, that otherwiſe 'tis impoſſible
the People ſhould ever be brought to eſpouſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.
To comprehend the force of this Reaſon
it muſt be remember'd that the Deſign of your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
Title to poſſeſs theſe newly-diſcover'd Nations,
is no other than the publication of the Goſpel, to
ſpread the knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt among 'em;
and conſequently your Majeſty is oblig'd to remove
all Impediments that oppoſe this end, by eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good Laws and Orders, and uſing all other juſt
ways and means to render this deſign proſperous.
The End is always the great Spring that ſhould give
motion and direction to our Actions; and 'tis this
we ought to have principally in view, that we may
the better foreſee what Obſtructions are likely to
lie in our way, and take the moſt ſutable meaſures
to attain the end propos'd. Now 'tis certain, that
the Power uſurp'd by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> over the <hi>Indians</hi>
is one of the greateſt hindrances to the preaching of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57864:104"/>
the Goſpel among 'em for their Converſion. All
the World knows their exceſſive Avarice makes 'em
unwilling to ſuffer the Miſſionary Monks to preach
the Goſpel to the <hi>Indians,</hi> whom thoſe Tyrants look
upon as their Vaſſals; becauſe the publication of the
Goſpel (they ſay) occaſions a conſiderable damage
to 'em two ways. Firſt, becauſe theſe Monks make
the <hi>Indians</hi> loſe too much time in hearing their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions;
theſe People (ſay they) are naturally
lazy and negligent, ſo that when they are diverted
from their Work, 'tis hard to bring 'em to it again.
It has often happen'd when the Monks had got the
<hi>Indians</hi> together in their Church to inſtruct 'em, the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> have come upon 'em, and taken away a
hundred or two by force, beating 'em cruelly to the
ſcandal of the reſt, in ſpite of what the poor Monks
could ſay or do. And ſuch Violences can't but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
impede the Salvation of the <hi>Indians.</hi> Another
Diſadvantage the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pretend to receive from
the Converſion of the <hi>Indians,</hi> is, that when they are
once inſtructed in the Maxims of Chriſtianity, they
grow proud and untractable, and not ſo capable to
ſerve 'em: and is not this an open Confeſſion that
their private Intereſt is dearer to 'em than the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of theſe Peoples Souls? The frame of their
mind is an habitual mortal Sin againſt Charity, the
Order of which they pervert, not only in not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
their Salvation themſelves, which they ought
every day to do, being oblig'd in Conſcience either
to inſtruct 'em, or procure others to do ſo; but
alſo in that they are ſo far from acquitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of this duty, that with all their might they
hinder others from informing 'em, without being
afraid of the Judgments of that God, who will one
day ſeverely puniſh 'em for want of Charity to their
Neighbours, in witholding light from 'em, tho
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57864:105"/>
they have ſo much need of Information. They
hinder the pious Miſſionaries from coming to preach
to 'em, leſt they ſhould become acquainted with their
Vexations and Cruelties, which are ſo great and
ſtrange, that the Monks are ſeiz'd with horror when
the <hi>Indians</hi> relate 'em. And when they ſee with their
own Eyes how miſerably the <hi>Indians</hi> are treated,
they make it their buſineſs (as they are bound in
duty to God) to oppoſe theſe Diſorders. They
ſometimes advertiſe the Judges of thoſe Tribunals
your Majeſty has eſtabliſhed there of theſe things,
to ſeek to redreſs 'em that way; tho the means hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
uſed have had very little effect; becauſe
the Governors and Judges having a great many <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
themſelves, to whom they are unmerciful and
cruel, abuſe their Power in oppreſſing theſe poor
Creatures, cauſing 'em to be puniſh'd rigorouſly for
the ſlighteſt faults. This is the true reaſon why the
Monks are look'd upon as ſo many troubleſom Spies,
and the Enemies of their temporal Intereſt; ſo
that they can't endure ſo much as to ſee 'em, nor
would they willingly tolerate 'em in the Country,
but often curſe 'em, and invent all ſorts of Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
againſt 'em. The poor <hi>Indians</hi> almoſt deſpair
to ſee any end of their Miſeries; and having nothing
to truſt to but the Zeal and Charity of the Monks,
do love and reverence 'em as their Deliverers and
Protectors, ſtill putting great Confidence in them
under all their troubles; they often come in Bodies
out of their Towns and Cities to meet 'em: But 'tis
a great mortification to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to ſee the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
pay theſe good Men ſo much reſpect; and
they take occaſion from hence to reproach 'em,
pretending the Monks deſign to make themſelves
the Lords and Maſters of theſe poor Wretches. But
God only knows what Labors and Hardſhips theſe
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57864:105"/>
Miſſionaries undergo, and to what Extremity they
are often reduc'd by poverty and hunger; when
they undertake great Journeys with inexpreſſible
fatigue, in rough and troubleſom ways, to aſſiſt the
<hi>Indians,</hi> and ſhew 'em the way of Salvation; and to
admoniſh the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of their enormous Sins, in
tormenting 'em ſo many ways, in robbing and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
'em: all which Violences call for large reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
if they expect to be ſav'd. Covetouſneſs
and Injuſtice reign more in the <hi>Indies,</hi> than in all the
World beſides; tho the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have no juſt right
nor power there, ſince they don't derive it of your
Majeſty. The <hi>Indians</hi> are naturally timorous and
cowardly, or rather the ill Treatments and Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have terrified 'em to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that conſternation and dread are become na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to 'em, inſomuch that they ſcarce remember
they are Men.</p>
                              <p>'Tis impoſſible for Men in their Condition to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
themſelves to hear the preaching of the Goſpel,
that ſo they might become Chriſtians, ſince the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> ſo ſtrenuouſly oppoſe it; who ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to give up the Title they have uſurp'd over
them, ever ſince they made a Conqueſt of 'em, as
they are wont to boaſt. They that have any Intereſt
in a Governor's favor, diſpoſe of the Perſons of
the <hi>Indians</hi> as their proper Goods, and divide 'em
among themſelves, as if they were born abſolute
Vaſſals. Two or three <hi>Spaniards</hi> will ſometimes
appropriate to themſelves a whole Nation of <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
It may be the Maſter of the Family falls to
the Lot of one, his Wife to another, and their
Children to a third. They are ſent to the Mines
loaded like Horſes, and forc'd to carry heavy Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
a hundred or two hundred Leagues; this is
ſeen every day. To obviate theſe Diſorders, it
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57864:106"/>
will not be ſufficient that your Majeſty demand your
Tributes, and threaten thoſe with ſevere Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
who ſhall preſume to torment the <hi>Indians</hi> for
the future, or exact ſuch Tasks of 'em as they are
not juſtly oblig'd to perform; for they'l ſtill perſiſt
in the ſame courſe.</p>
                              <p>As the ſevere Bondage of the <hi>Indians</hi> is a great
obſtacle to their Converſion on the one hand, ſo on
the other is the courſe taken to diſperſe 'em at a
diſtance one from another, whereby 'tis almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to aſſemble a conſiderable number of 'em.
Both theſe ways prevent their being inſtructed in
our Religion, and put in the way of Salvation.
'Tis neceſſary in order to their being fed with the
Divine Word, that they live in Society, and be in
a condition to be eaſily aſſembled; and 'tis as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
they ſhould enjoy an entire Liberty, that
they might voluntarily embrace the Word of God.
The Learned ſay there was no Syſtem of written
Laws given by God in the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe
the Church was his Family, and did not conſiſt of any
whole Nation. Nor did God ſee good to give his
Law to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> while in <hi>Egypt,</hi> tho they were
then a numerous People, and computed to be no leſs
than ſix hundred thouſand Men able to bear Arms,
becauſe they were not a free People, being yet in
Captivity. But the Almighty gave 'em his Law
when theſe two conditions were found in 'em to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
namely, when they were both Numerous and
Free; which was not till he had employ'd his Power
to deliver 'em from the Yoke of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> But of
all Laws, that of the Goſpel eſpecially requires
both theſe Conditions, becauſe it ſuppoſes Perſons
at liberty to ſeek to be inſtructed in it, and to put
the Precepts of it in practiſe. And 'tis very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for thoſe that obſerve the Laws of Chriſt to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57864:106"/>
incorporate themſelves and live in Societies, that
they may perform the ſolemn Acts of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
by the practice of the ſeven Sacraments and
other Ceremonies of the Church. 'Tis neceſſary
for Chriſtians to meet together from time to time
in public to hear the Word of God, and aſſiſt at
other parts of his Worſhip, that ſo new Converts
may be confirm'd in the manner of Life they have
embrac'd; for without theſe helps they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly
decline in their Zeal, and might come even
to loſe their Faith. In ſhort, if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are
permitted to keep the <hi>Indians</hi> ſcatter'd up and down
on the Mountains, and in the Vallies, and to employ
'em perpetually in performing the unreaſonable
Tasks they exact of 'em, it will be impoſſible to
inſtruct 'em in our Religion to any purpoſe.</p>
                              <p>By what has been ſaid, your Majeſty may very well
conceive what Diſorders reign in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and
how neceſſary 'tis to hinder the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Natives under ſo ſevere a Yoke, and
from proceeding to depopulate the Country as they
have hitherto done. And that which is yet more
deplorable, is, that they ſuffer 'em to die without
taking care to have the Sacraments adminiſter'd to
'em, having no more regard for 'em than for Dogs
or Horſes. One would think they believ'd theſe
People to have no immortal Souls, but were uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Rewards or Puniſhments in the other Life.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are no way qualified either to be
Lords and Maſters of the <hi>Indians,</hi> or to teach 'em
the Doctrin of the Goſpel, or to induce 'em to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it by their Examples. A conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Indians</hi> were committed to the care of <hi>John
Colmenero</hi> to be inſtructed in our Religion, tho he
was ſo ignorant that he knew not well how to make
the ſign of the Croſs, or give any tolerable account
of his own Faith; in ſo much that when he was ask'd
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57864:107"/>
what he taught thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> under his Conduct, he
could make no other Anſwer than that he taught
'em to make the ſign of the Croſs, but pronounc'd
the words wrong that are us'd in that Ceremony.
When the <hi>Indians</hi> of one Province had brought all
their Idols to the Miſſionaries, with Proteſtations that
they now deteſted that impious Worſhip, and were
reſolv'd to ſerve the true God for time to come,
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſold theſe very Idols to other <hi>Indians,</hi>
or exchang'd 'em for Slaves. What concern of Mind
can the <hi>Spaniards</hi> be ſuppos'd to have for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of theſe People, when they only deſign to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
themſelves, and thereby to be qualified for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
above their Rank; and when they are
ſo ignorant, that they don't know the Creed, or ten
Commandments? They are ſordidly covetous, and
indeed give themſelves up to all ſorts of Vices; ſo
that their Lives are infamous and abominable. The
<hi>Indians</hi> are comparatively more honeſt and virtuous
than they are: for tho they are Pagans and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
yet are content with one Wife, as Nature
teaches 'em, while they ſee Chriſtians take fourteen
or fifteen Women, how expreſly ſoever the Law
they profeſs forbids it. Many of the <hi>Indians</hi> ſcarce
know what it is to rob one another, to offer Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to any one, or to commit Murder: Whereas
they ſee the Chriſtians guilty of all theſe, againſt
all Reaſons and Juſtice, and that they violate all their
Oaths, ſo that there is no ground to put the leaſt
confidence in 'em. The poor <hi>Indians</hi> that are Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of the Crimes of ſuch as call themſelves
Chriſtians, think the God they worſhip is the vileſt
and moſt unjuſt God in the world, becauſe he does
not immediately inflict ſome ſignal Puniſhment on
thoſe that pretend to ſerve him, for their flagitious
Lives. They alſo think your Majeſty the moſt cruel
of all Princes, becauſe your Subjects are ſo abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57864:107"/>
vicious; they fancy (as I have before ſaid)
that your Majeſty drinks human Blood, and eats
the Fleſh of Men. And tho theſe things may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
ſtrange and ſurprizing to your Majeſty, they
are no news to us who have been accuſtom'd to 'em.
And we can't but wonder, that ſome extraordinary
marks of the Divine Anger and Indignation have
not been inflicted on <hi>Spain</hi> to make her ſmart for
the Crimes committed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Your Majeſty may by this time very well perceive
the Character of thoſe Men to whom the charge and
care of the Souls of the <hi>Indians</hi> is committed. And
'tis no wonder that there's ſo little done either for
their temporal or ſpiritual Advantage, ſince the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the <hi>Indies,</hi> under ſuch Conduct. God is
no more known there now than he was before, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be in the Province of <hi>Mexico.</hi> And that
ſlight Inſtruction the People have had there has coſt
'em very dear: Tho the Son of God commanded
his Diſciples to give that freely which they had
freely receiv'd. The <hi>Indians</hi> were committed to
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> on condition they would undertake to
teach 'em the Chriſtian Religion: therefore ſince
they have acquitted themſelves ſo ill of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
they ought to make reſtitution of all they
have taken from 'em under this pretext. However,
God will not be mocked, who ſees all things, and is
a witneſs of all the wicked Actions of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
who have made it their buſineſs only to torment
and inſlave theſe poor People inſtead of taking
care to inform 'em of the Truth. And indeed
theſe ſecular Men are not very proper to be made
Preachers of the Goſpel. Your Majeſty has been
ill ſerv'd in not having had good Information given
you of the ill deportment of your Subjects. For
'tis not to be doubted but your Majeſty would
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57864:108"/>
have provided a Remedy, if due care had been
taken to give you advice of it: Or if your Majeſty
had not done it, you would have very much wrong'd
your Conſcience in ſending ſuch Men into the new
World to preach the Faith, and give teſtimony to
the Doctrin of Jeſus Chriſt, who are abſolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of ſo honourable a Miniſtry, and even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry
and debaſe it by their ſcandalous Converſation.
'Tis therefore neceſſary that this Employment be
taken away from Secular, and committed to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Perſons, as agreeing better with their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
which may be done without giving theſe
Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters any occaſion to claim a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Juriſdiction over the <hi>Indians;</hi> for if that
ſhould be allow'd, we ſhould fall into the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
we are endeavouring to avoid. The
corrupt Lives and evil Examples of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
do more hurt than the preaching of an infinit
number of Prieſts and Monks can do good. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your Majeſty is oblig'd in Conſcience to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of the power they uſurp over
the <hi>Indians,</hi> and never ſuffer 'em to make 'em their
Vaſſals.</p>
                              <p>One principal Reaſon that proves this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, that People ought to enjoy Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity,
that they may be in a condition to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Worſhip of God, and the good Works
preſcrib'd by the Chriſtian Religion, and not to be
diverted from the Sacraments by being condemn'd
to continual Labor. Which ſtate of Peace and
Reſt can't ſubſiſt without preſerving to every Man
his Property, and guarding him from all the aſſaults
of Injury and Injuſtice. The Governors of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths
are bound by the Law of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
out of the way all Obſtructions to ſo neceſſary
a Peace, and ſpeedily to allay thoſe Diſſenſions and
Troubles that may continue Diſcord among ſuch as
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57864:108"/>
profeſs Chriſtianity, becauſe 'tis directly oppoſit to
the end of God in creating Men; for he ſends 'em
into the World to obſerve his Commands, and to
apply themſelves to the exerciſe of Religion and
good Works, that they may thereby merit eternal
Life. This good order is neceſſary in every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Republic, but there eſpecially where the Chriſtian
Faith has been but lately entertain'd. The <hi>Spaniards</hi>
are too covetous and ſelf-intereſted to have any
Juriſdiction over the <hi>Indians</hi> granted 'em, becauſe
they'l never give 'em any reſpit or repoſe, but go
on to rob and torment 'em all the ways they can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.
There is no kind of Injuſtice but they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it to ſpoil theſe poor People, and therefore
there is no way to ſhelter 'em from their Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
but by annexing the <hi>Indies</hi> to the proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of your Majeſty's Crown. The <hi>Spaniards</hi>
kill the <hi>Indians</hi> with impunity in the Fields, in the
High-ways, and in the Mines, and do it more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
becauſe many times there are no Witneſſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to convict 'em of their Cruelties. So that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more evident, than that the <hi>Indians</hi> are
not in a condition to compoſe their Minds to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the Divine Word, ſo as to be induc'd to
obey the Divine Commands, while the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are
their abſolute Lords, who will continually haraſs
'em with endleſs Trouble and Perſecution, which
will fill their minds with Anguiſh and Vexation, and
all kinds of Miſery, nay with an averſion to your
Majeſty, and a great hatred to our God, and to his
Law, which ſeems to 'em ſo ſevere, ſo heavy and
intolerable a Yoke. They can't but think your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Government is tyrannical, as well as that the
God whom we adore is unjuſt and unmerciful; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
him the Author of all the Violence they ſuffer
from the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> becauſe while they, on pretence
of preaching the Catholic Faith, bring ſo many
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57864:109"/>
terrible Calamities upon 'em, their God ſuffers this
without puniſhing their Injuſtice and Impiety after a
very remarkable manner. Theſe unfortunate Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have no other Relief than what they find in
their Tears, which they pour forth day and night,
proteſting their own Gods were more kind and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
than the God of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> and ſaying
they enjoy'd a ſettl'd Peace, and all the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
of Life while they ſerv'd their own Gods,
whereas ever ſince they had been under the power
of the Chriſtians, they had been expos'd to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Abuſes. This makes 'em abhor the Catholic
Faith, and by conſequence puts thoſe that preach
to 'em out of a condition to attain their end: So
that your Majeſty is beyond all queſtion oblig'd by
the Law of God to reſcue the <hi>Indians</hi> from the Yoke
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to take 'em under your own
Protection.</p>
                              <p>I farther add, that the power your Majeſty has
over the People of the New World, has been
granted you by the Grace of God and the Suffrage
of the Church, both for the temporal and eternal
Advantage of the <hi>Indians,</hi> which Privilege is a kind
of neceſſary means of their Salvation. So that the
Government of 'em belongs of right to none but
your Majeſty, with the excluſion of all other Powers
whatſoever, unleſs they deſire to fruſtrate all the
Advantages both ſpiritual and temporal, which the
<hi>Indians</hi> might hope to reap from the Converſation
of the <hi>Europeans.</hi> Your Majeſty's Character and
Juriſdiction over 'em engages you to remove all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles
that may hinder them from obtaining theſe
Advantages, and being ſav'd through Faith by the
preaching of the Goſpel. Your Majeſty ought not
to ſuffer your Authority to become infamous and
odious, nor your Subjects to uſurp a tyrannical
Power that will infallibly iſſue in the deſtruction of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57864:109"/>
the <hi>Indians,</hi> if they muſt be Vaſſals to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
who treat 'em ſo cruelly and inhumanly. When
we firſt arriv'd in the New World, we ſaw innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
multitudes of People inhabiting the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of <hi>New-Spain, Cuba, Jamaica,</hi> and the Iſle
of <hi>St. John,</hi> which are now all deſolate. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
and Kingdoms of the Continent are in a yet
more deplorable condition, tho once as well peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
as <hi>Toledo</hi> and <hi>Seville.</hi> There's ſcarce any place
in the World where Men and other Animals multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
ſo much as they do in the <hi>Indies,</hi> becauſe the
Air of the Country being temperate, favours Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.
But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have found out the
art of entirely depopulating large Countries fill'd
with infinit numbers of People, for they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
maſſacred ſome to poſſeſs themſelves of their
Gold and Silver, others they have deſtroy'd by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
Labors, or by forcing them to carry unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Burdens in long Journies; in a word, they
have ſacrific'd the poor <hi>Indians</hi> to enrich themſelves.
We advance nothing but the very Truth, and all
that we have ſaid does not expreſs half of what we
have ſeen; nor will it be a difficult task to convince
them of falſhood who dare maintain the contrary
before your Majeſty. None but ſuch as have ſhar'd
in the fruit of this Rapine and Cruelty, will oppoſe
the truth of ſuch Facts as are known to all the
world. And 'twill be in vain to pretend that any
contagious Diſtemper has made a Country of 2500
leagues deſolate, which before was very populous.</p>
                              <p>The manner of governing Kingdoms ought to be
conformable to the Law of God and Man, for the
good and profit of the People, who are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
and preſerv'd from the Violence and Injuſtice
of thoſe that are deſtitute of the fear of God, and
uſe a tyrannical Power, merely obtain'd by Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
for the ruin and deſtruction of thoſe that are
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57864:110"/>
under 'em. Your Majeſty may eaſily be inform'd
how the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have abus'd the Power you grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
'em for the Converſion of the <hi>Indians,</hi> in turning
it to afflict and deſtroy 'em with unexampled Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And that which makes the caſe yet more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
is, that none of thoſe who have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in your Majeſty's ſervice have ever given you
advice of theſe great Diſorders, tho ſo very preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to your Intereſt, beſides the loſs of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
number of Souls who have periſh'd in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Paganiſm, out of which they might have
been eaſily reduc'd if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had in the leaſt
been govern'd by the fear of God.</p>
                              <p>Your Majeſty may pleaſe to remember that one
Article of the Will of the moſt Serene Queen <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
is expreſs'd after this manner:</p>
                              <p>
                                 <q>
                                    <hi>Item,</hi> Since the time wherein the Apoſtolic See
granted us the Iſles and Containent of the Ocean, it
has always been our principal Intention to cauſe
the Light of the Goſpel to ſhine on the People of
the New World, and to ſend Prelats and Monks
thither to convert and inſtruct 'em in the truth of
the Catholic Faith. Therefore I beſeech my Lord
the King, and the Princeſs my Daughter, to labour
with all their might to render this Enterprize
ſucceſsful, and to ſecure the <hi>Indians</hi> from receiving
any damage either in their Eſtates or Perſons, but
on the contrary to take care they be treated with
all ſorts of kindneſs; and that ſtrict and ſpeedy
Juſtice be executed upon any one that ſhall offer
'em the leaſt Injury, and to keep exactly to the
terms of the Apoſtolic Brief diſpatched for this
Grant.</q> Theſe are the expreſs Words of that Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
Princeſs: And yet no ſooner was ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd,
but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> began to abuſe the <hi>Indians,</hi>
and to offer 'em all the Outrages of which we have
been ſpeaking, and could give your Majeſty a more
ample Relation.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="201" facs="tcp:57864:110"/>
To all the foregoing Reaſons it may be added,
that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are declar'd Enemies to the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and deſign nothing but their deſtruction, and
to get poſſeſſion of their Country; which is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
a truth, that 'tis altogether needleſs to
prove it. For he is properly a Man's declar'd Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
who goes about to accuſe him of ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
Crime, that deſerves death; who deprives him
of his Liberty and the greateſt part of his Goods;
who makes a cruel War upon him and inſlaves him;
who ſeeks all Occaſions to kill him, and takes away
his Wife and Children to inſlave 'em; who uſurps
all the Goods of his Relations when they die, and
unjuſtly raviſhes from him all that is dear to him.
Certainly ſuch Violences as theſe are againſt the
Rights both of People and Princes; and 'tis ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to demonſtrate the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to be the declared
Enemies of the <hi>Indians,</hi> that they have done 'em all
the miſchief which we have been relating. For
they have calumniated and accus'd 'em of the moſt
horrible and infamous Crimes that can be imagin'd,
meerly to get poſſeſſion of their Eſtates, and ſtrip
'em of all they had under this pretext; whereas the
practices they charge 'em with are purely imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
and ſuch as have never been ſo much as heard
of in the great Iſlands of <hi>New Spain, Cuba, Jamaica,</hi>
and St. <hi>John,</hi> tho they have been all very populous;
for after the moſt exact Enquiries we were able to
to make, we could never find the leaſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of thoſe abominable Sins, to which ſome few
<hi>Perſians</hi> are addicted. The <hi>Indians</hi> of the Kingdom
of <hi>Yucatan</hi> know not what this unnatural Vice is.
Nor are there any great number of 'em that eat hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Fleſh. They are farther accus'd of Idolatry;
but Men have no right to puniſh 'em for this Crime,
which ought to be left to the Judgment of God.
Our Anceſtors were formerly Idolaters, as the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
                                 <pb n="202" facs="tcp:57864:111"/>
are now; and the whole Univerſe was pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with this Sin before the coming of Chriſt, and
before the Apoſtles had preach'd the Chriſtian Faith.
For God diſpers'd them up and down the World to
diſſipate the darkneſs that was ſpread over the
Earth: and they did not employ violence and force
of Arms to puniſh Idolatry, or other Sins that were
the Conſequences of Infidelity; they made uſe of
nothing but the good Examples of their Virtue and
Holineſs, together with their Doctrin, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the Menaces and Promiſes of the Word of
God; and we ought to do that in the <hi>Indies,</hi> which
they did in other parts of the World. This was the
Courſe which Chriſt himſelf firſt took, and then
oblig'd his Apoſtles to follow his Example. The
Son of God came to ſeek and to ſave that which was
loſt. Which of our Anceſtors could have been ſav'd
if they had been put to death for Crimes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the time of their unbelief? the expreſs Words
of the Goſpel are contrary to this Method; for
Chriſt ſays to his Diſciples, <hi>Thus it is written, and
thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer and to riſe from the dead
the third day; and that repentance and remiſſion of Sins
ſhould be preach'd in his Name among all Nations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
at</hi> Jeruſalem: <hi>And ye are Witneſſes of theſe
things,</hi> Luke 24. 46, 47, 48. which evidently proves
that the Goſpel ought to be at firſt preach'd to Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
by declaring of Peace, and the remiſſion of
Sins that are paſt, ſince Chriſt has given no power
or permiſſion to men to puniſh 'em.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have moreover preſum'd to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that the <hi>Indians</hi> were like brute Beaſts, utterly
uncapable of diſciplin, and unfit to receive the light
of Chriſtianity. Your Majeſty has good reaſon to
puniſh thoſe that declare ſuch notorious Falſhoods:
For under this Colour they have obtain'd of your
Majeſty a power to poſſeſs themſelves of the <hi>Indies</hi>
                                 <pb n="203" facs="tcp:57864:111"/>
as their abſolute Property, and to do the <hi>Indians</hi> what
miſchief they pleaſe. Thus have they impos'd on
the Conſcience of the moſt Catholic King; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
leave to carry away the Inhabitants of the
Iſlands and Countries that lie near <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> and
have accordingly forc'd 'em out of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
againſt all Law and Equity; ſo that an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
multitude both of Men and Women that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
above fifty Iſlands, ſome bigger than the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,</hi>
have been deſtroy'd, inſomuch that there are
but eleven Perſons left. I have been an Eye-witneſs
of this deſolation, as well as <hi>Peter de Liſle,</hi> who is a
man of honor and credit, and now a Monk of the
Order of <hi>St. Francis.</hi> He built a Brigantine, and
man'd it with Sea-men to make a review of thoſe
once populous Iſlands; and they found in all that
vaſt Country but eleven People (as has been ſaid)
tho they ſpent two years in making this Voyage.
'Tis impoſſible for me to expreſs to your Majeſty,
on the one hand, the great meekneſs, goodneſs of
temper, and ſincerity of the People of the New
World, and on the other, what enormous Rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and Cruelties the Chriſtians have exerciſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
'em. Your Bowels would be mov'd with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
and your heart too much affected, if an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
deſcription of all this were made you.</p>
                              <p>Cruel Wars have been rais'd in divers rich Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
without any fair occaſion, but only to gratify
the covetous humour of the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> At the ſame
time they flatter themſelves that they have Authority
from your Majeſty to employ force and violence to
inſlave theſe People. And all the difference they make
between thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> they look upon as their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and thoſe whom they treat as Slaves, is, that
they ſell the latter publicly, but uſe a little more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality
about ſelling the former, by ſeeking pretences
to hide their Injuſtice. In the unjuſt Wars they have
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57864:112"/>
made with 'em, after having kill'd the Maſters of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
they have alſo murder'd their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and poſſeſs'd themſelves of all they had. And
God is now pleas'd every day to ſhew us by his ſevere
Chaſtiſements that he has been grievouſly offended
by theſe Robberies and Cruelties. The Welfare of
the <hi>Indians</hi> both as to Body and Soul is in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
danger; for if they muſt be ſubject to the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Power of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they'l utterly deſtroy
'em, without ſparing any, ſo much as to propagate
their Race. If the Law of Nature forbids us to
commit a Pupil to the charge of one that is a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Enemy to him or his Parents, or has embezel'd
his Eſtate, or ſet him an ill Example; and yet he has
been given up to the care of a Perſon of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter;
the Judges would be oblig'd to rectify the
matter, by taking him from under his Conduct,
whatever ſecurity he offers to give for his fidelity.
'Tis much the ſame caſe with the <hi>Indians</hi> in reſpect of
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for theſe would have it believ'd that
they are the Guardians, Tutors, and Protectors of
the other: tho 'tis only a fraudulent pretence to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare
'em. The <hi>Indians</hi> know well enough how to
govern themſelves, without being beholden to Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians;
and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are no way capable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
'em in the things of Religion, which yet
is the main thing the <hi>Indians</hi> want, and the greateſt
kindneſs that can be done 'em. And 'tis eaſy to ſee
what diſpoſition the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have towards 'em, as
to their temporal advantage. So that 'tis moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
they are their declar'd Enemies; ſince they have
ſtrip'd 'em of all their Goods, offer'd all ſorts of
abuſes to their Perſons, and taken away their Wives
and Children, whom they have condemn'd to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Slavery; which courſe, together with the cruel
Wars made upon 'em, has almoſt quite unpeopled the
New World. How is it poſſible that men that lead
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57864:112"/>
ſuch kind of Lives, ſhould inſpire the <hi>Indians</hi> with
the deſire of embracing the Law of God, and the
love of Virtue, eſpecially ſeeing they many ways
perſecute the very Monks, who are ſo zealous for
the Reformation of theſe Idolaters? On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſpare nothing that may debauch
'em, and expoſe 'em to all ſorts of Vice by the evil
Patterns they ſet 'em: They teach 'em to ſwear and
blaſpheme the holy Name of God, tho in reality the
poor <hi>Indians</hi> don't do it deſignedly, but only becauſe
they hear the <hi>Spaniards</hi> uſe ſuch Expreſſions. 'Tis
therefore plain that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ought not to have
any Juriſdiction over the <hi>Indians,</hi> if their advantage
either as to this Life or that to come be conſider'd,
ſeeing they are the mortal Enemies of this People,
and think of nothing but how to deſtroy 'em. It
would therefore be a piece of great Injuſtice to
abandon 'em to ſuch Men, when their Diſpoſition
toward 'em is ſo well known; it being a mortal Sin
to expoſe one's Neighbor to evident danger of
loſing his Life: And we doubt not but your Majeſty
will be cautious of falling under the guilt of ſuch a
Crime, and not give up the <hi>Indians</hi> to the fury of
the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>All juſt and reaſonable Laws, and thoſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
that have written on Morality are againſt
placing any Government in the hands of neceſſitous
and covetous Men, whoſe greateſt end is to get rid
of their Poverty, and to deliver themſelves from
that mean condition in which they live, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are ready to ſacrifice all the obligations of
Duty to the deſire they have of becoming rich.
And becauſe this greedy Paſſion is continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing,
and their Minds are wholly ſet on the ways
of heaping up Wealth, and filling their Cheſts, they
find no reſt but in ſatisfying their Avarice. They
abhor Poverty as Nature does a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57864:113"/>
have no other thoughts night or day but to
contrive means of amaſſing together as much Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
as they can. Upon this account the Philoſopher
determins that 'tis a dangerous thing to put Nations
or Provinces under the Government of ſuch as are
covetous or needy, who are reſolv'd to be rich at
any rate in the world. We are inform'd in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that the <hi>Romans</hi> being about to ſend two Conſuls
to govern <hi>Spain,</hi> one of whom was poor and the
other covetous; when this Affair was propos'd to
the Senat, <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> gave his opinion that
neither of 'em was proper to make a Governor,
there being reaſon to fear that both would abuſe
their Authority to feather their Neſts out of the
public Stock; becauſe ſuch kind of Perſons are like
Leeches in a Commonwealth, and make it their
principal care to gather ſomething on every ſide,
and to devour the Subſtance of the People, making
themſelves rich at their charge, becauſe their
covetous Deſires can never be ſatiated as long as
they remain in this World: Nay it muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that this Vice moſt commonly proves incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
ſo that if Men greedy of Lucre get Authority
over any People, they will not fail to ſpoil and ruin
'em, becauſe the Paſſion that animates 'em, keeps no
bounds or meaſures. No Laws nor Penalties with
which they can be menaced, will be ſtrong enough
to reſtrain 'em, as long as they are inveſted with
Power; and the more ſucceſsful any covetous Man
finds his Induſtry to be, the more earneſtly does he
deſire and purſue Riches, which he accounts the
ſupreme Good. The deſire of being rich produces
much the ſame effect in the mind of a poor cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Man, as the hope of Celeſtial Happineſs would
in that of a good Man; for as this perfectly fills up
the Capacity of his Mind that ardently wiſhes for
it, ſo the Miſer's Soul can deſire nothing beſides
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57864:113"/>
hoards of Treaſure, wherein his Happineſs conſiſts,
becauſe Money anſwers all things: For this is that
which capacitates Men to undertake the greateſt
Enterprizes, and to obtain whatever they deſire in
this World, the higheſt Employments, Honors and
Dignities, coſtly Habit, and the moſt delicious Dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
this facilitates their commiſſion of all ſorts of
Crimes, gives 'em opportunity to be reveng'd on
their Enemies, to acquaint themſelves with Perſons
of great Quality, and to obtain their Favour and
Eſteem. 'Tis on theſe accounts that the Men of the
world ſeek it with all their might, and expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to ſo many Fatigues and Perils, as well as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate
the greateſt Villanies to procure it.</p>
                              <p>Now the poſſeſſion of Riches can never ſatisfy
the Soul, ſo as to give it perfect content; for 'tis
perpetually craving what it does not yet poſſeſs.
Therefore the Worldling, who has choſen Mony
for his chief Good and laſt End, is indifferent as to
other things, but devotes himſelf entirely to this,
employing all his care and diligence to increaſe his
Bags; and his thirſt of Gold grows more and more
violent, by how much the more his Eſtate ſwells,
according to the Philoſopher's Maxim, that Motion
is by ſo much the more impetuous, by how much
the nearer it approaches its end.</p>
                              <p>Avarice is a more incurable Evil than Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
becauſe its Object, and the things it promiſes
attract the Hearts of Men with greater violence;
and the power of Mony is of a larger extent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it puts a Man in a condition to gratify his
Luſt, whereas this on the other hand can't procure
him Riches. The love of Mony endures longer on
the Mind than the Appetite of ſenſual Pleaſures,
how violent and impetuous ſoever they may be for
a time. Covetouſneſs is always on the advance, and
ſeldom extinguiſh'd but with a Man's Life: For the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57864:114"/>
more a Man's natural Infirmites increaſe, the more
the deſire of heaping up Wealth fortifies it ſelf; as
'tis obſervable in old Men, that the nearer they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
their end, the more covetous they uſually
grow; becauſe as their Health and Strength gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
diminiſh, they think they have the more need
of the aſſiſtance of the things of this World.</p>
                              <p>Theſe Reaſons make it evident, that if any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
or Government be given to covetous Men,
they will not fail to oppreſs and vex thoſe that are
ſubjected to them, that they may make themſelves
rich at their coſts; and that nothing will hinder 'em
from gratifying their Avarice whenever they have
a fair occaſion; for this Vice is the root and ſpring
of all others, 'tis the ſource of Treaſon, Fraud,
Perjury, Violence, Rapine, and barbarous Cruelty.
This Paſſion is ſaid to be blind, becauſe it occaſions
blindneſs in the Mind, and benights the Reaſon with
the groſſeſt Darkneſs, and hinders him that is cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated
with it from perceiving his danger. The
ſight of Gold, tho it cauſes the commiſſion of all
manner of Crimes, and is the ſource of Calumnies,
gives him more Joy than the light of the Sun, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he finds his Account in the ruin of others.
It excludes Fidelity, and baniſhes Union and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
out of the World; it violates Charity, and
produces all manner of Miſchief; it knows no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
but induces Men to diſclaim their very Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and break all the ties of Faith and Amity;
it never ſuffers a Man to ſympathize with his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's
Miſeries, but even makes him diſregard his
Relations as if utterly unacquainted with them.
The covetous Man never forgives himſelf his own
Expences, and leads a miſerable Life in the midſt of
Plenty and Wealth. This greedy humor ſo darkens
the Underſtandings of thoſe that are bewitch'd by it,
that they know not how to make a right Judgment
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:57864:114"/>
of any thing, but inſtead of following the Dictates
of reaſon, are on all occaſions driven down the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous
Current of their beloved Vice, all their
Thoughts and Deſires are directed this way, and
yet they can never quench the inſatiable Thirſt that
preys upon their Souls.</p>
                              <p>But I muſt now apply all theſe Reaſons to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in hand: and I beſeech your Majeſty to give
attention to the Conſequences I draw from 'em.
All the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that leave their own Country to
go into the <hi>Indies</hi> are poor, and 'tis only Avarice
that drives them thither; for they don't only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to raiſe themſelves a little above a condition of
Poverty and Want, but to amaſs vaſt Treaſures to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
without ſetting any Limits to their unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable
Covetouſneſs, that they may be able to buy
honorable Offices and Emploiments, and advance
themſelves far above their degree. We have been
taught by experience that in a few years, many <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
who were in the meaneſt and baſeſt condition,
and always led a miſerable Life, have conſiderably
alter'd their fortune by the Riches they have brought
from the New World, and likewiſe introduc'd
great corruption of Manners throughout all <hi>Spain.</hi>
The love of Mony is now grown to that height,
that Gold and Silver ſeem the only Gods that are
worſhip'd. They that know not how to advance
themſelves by induſtry and labor, do it by plundring
and robbing without any fear of puniſhment. They
take away from the poor <hi>Indians</hi> all they find in their
houſes, and after all make 'em work to get ſtill more
out of their ſweat and labor; ſo that if any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over the <hi>Indians</hi> be allow'd 'em, they'l certainly
abuſe it to enrich themſelves, while this deteſtable
covetouſneſs reigns in their minds. And what can
the poor <hi>Indians</hi> do to ſhake off their tyrannical
Yoke, ſince they are naturally meek, quiet and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57864:115"/>
and dare not complain or murmur; or if they
ſhould, have no body to hearken to 'em or defend
'em? The <hi>Spaniards</hi> who have an abſolute Power,
are always chiding and domineering over 'em wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are, in the Fields, on the Mountains, in
the Mines, in the Deſarts, or in the High-Ways.
They take all the furniture of their Houſes from
'em, which is their greateſt Riches, as well as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
'em to the greateſt dangers, and moſt intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Labours, beating and inflicting on 'em the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt
Puniſhments for the leaſt Trifle, when they
hope to get any thing by it. What a piece of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
then muſt it be to abandon ſuch meek
and ſubmiſſive Creatures to the fury of ſuch men
as theſe, when they are in no capacity to reſiſt the
tyranny of their Perſecutors, but are made their
meer tools?</p>
                              <p>What would one ſay of that Judg, who after
he has received information of the violent paſſion of
a wild Spark in the heat of Youth, to a beautiful
Virgin, ſhould notwithſtanding order 'em to live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the ſame houſe, and give him an abſolute
power over her, but withal threatning to puniſh
him ſeverely if he offer'd her any violence? Could
any one ſafely confide in the Promiſes of ſuch a man
as this, whatever Proteſtations he ſhould make of
moderating his paſſion on ſo critical an occaſion? It
is not to be doubted but ſuch a Judg would commit
a mortal Sin, in thus expoſing his Neighbour to ſo
dangerous a Temptation, tho he ſhould happen to
abſtain from the Sin to which he has ſo great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion.
It almoſt amounts to the ſame thing to
put the <hi>Indians</hi> under the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
who are their mortal Enemies; for if they
don't maſſacre 'em in cold blood meerly out of the
hatred they bear 'em, they do it however to get
their Goods, and rob 'em of their Treaſure. And
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57864:115"/>
as in the former Inſtance it would be next to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
for that amorous Youth not to abandon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the Conduct of his Paſſion, when the Object
of it is committed to his diſpoſal; ſo 'tis not to be
expected that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould abſtain from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
all ſorts of Outrages on the <hi>Indians,</hi> and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing
both their Eſtates and Lives to their own
Intereſt, ſince their Avarice irritates 'em with
greater violence (if poſſible) than Luſt does the
other in the former caſe: ſo that Laws back'd with
Menaces and Puniſhments will make no impreſſions
on the minds of theſe men, but they'l be ſure ſtill to
exerciſe a thouſand Cruelties on the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> if
no other courſe be taken to give check to their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs.</p>
                              <p>I entreat your Majeſty to conſider what befals any
Province to which you ſend a Governor. If he be
covetous, and regardleſs both of his Honor or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
what Diſorders and Miſchiefs does he not bring
with him? Tho he has not ſo abſolute a Power as
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have over the <hi>Indians</hi> whom they keep
in their Houſes; tho the Royal Council of <hi>Spain</hi>
think themſelves concern'd to oppoſe his Prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and tho the King's Preſence one would think
ſhould be a ſtrong Bridle to reſtrain his Exactions:
yet in two years time, ſuch a Governor as we have
bin deſcribing will become rich, by the Rapine and
Extortion he commits in the Province put under his
care. What then is it likely the <hi>Spaniards</hi> will do,
in the remoteſt parts of the <hi>Indies,</hi> when they have
an unlimited Power over the <hi>Indians,</hi> and neither
ſtand in awe of God nor the King; and when theſe
poor People are under ſo great apprehenſion of
ſtill more intolerable Cruelties, that they dare not
complain of the violence they ſuffer? And how
ſhall they report their Grievances? ſhall they go to
the Royal Council, which is it may be three or four
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57864:116"/>
hundred Leagues from 'em; or ſhall they addreſs
themſelves to your Royal Throne, which is diſtant
above three thouſand? What courſe ſhall they take
to prove the Inſults, Vexations and Perſecutions
they endure from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in Countries ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
where they can expect no relief?</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are ſo hardn'd by their exceſſive
Avarice, that they are not in the leaſt touch'd with
the Groans and Complaints of theſe miſerable Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
for nothing makes impreſſion on their minds
but Gold and Silver. The Condition to which they
advance themſelves in the <hi>Indies</hi> is ſo far above their
former ſtate, that it inſpires 'em with intolerable
Pride and Arrogancy. They paſs away their time
in pleaſure and feaſting, and clothe themſelves after
ſo ſumptuous a manner, that nothing in the World
can be more magnificent. And withal it may well be
ſaid that nothing can equal the corruption, licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs
and diſſoluteneſs of their Manners; and to
ſupply all theſe ſuperfluous Expences and Exceſſes,
they ſuck out the very Blood of the poor <hi>Indians.</hi>
Now ſeeing there's no hope of obliging the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
to alter their Conduct, and both the Laws of
God, and right Reaſon, and all the Maxims of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Prudence oppoſe the giving of any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into the hands of covetous and indigent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who are prejudic'd with a violent deſire of
gain: Much leſs ought your Majeſty to ſuffer the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> to uſurp a Title to the <hi>Indians</hi> as their
Free-hold, when they are ſo greedy and inſatiable,
that they'l make no difficulty to ſacrifice all kinds of
duty to the deſire they have of raking ſums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
together any way in the World. For all their
Induſtry will be employ'd in pillaging their Vaſſals;
and which is yet more to be lamented, while they
cruelly deprive 'em of temporal Life, they likewiſe
take a courſe to expoſe 'em to eternal Death.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57864:116"/>
Therefore your Majeſty ought to incorporate the
<hi>Indies</hi> with the Inheritance of your Crown, that you
may be the univerſal Father, Protector, Governor
and Lord of all the <hi>Indians.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>I add to all the foregoing Reaſons, that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
impoſe intolerable Burdens on the <hi>Indians,</hi>
and exact ſuch Services of 'em as reduce 'em to the
extremity of miſery and deſpair. 'Tis their firſt
and principal duty to ſerve and obey their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Princes; becauſe this is founded on the Law of
Nature. In the ſecond place, they owe your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
ſervice and obedience, as being their univerſal
Soveraign; which is an obligation of Divine Right,
founded on the Engagement your Majeſty has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
to ſend 'em the Light of the Goſpel, and
to take care for their Inſtruction in the orthodox
Faith. The third kind of Service is that which the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> oblige 'em to render them whether they
will or no, which is a ſevere and tyrannical Yoke, nay
more intolerable than what the Heathen Tyrants im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
on the primitive Chriſtians; it may be liken'd
to the torment the Devils inflict on the Damned in
Hell. The Violence of it is contrary to all the Laws
of Nature and Reaſons, nor can it be juſtified by any
human Laws. It muſt be remembred that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
are naturally weak, going always naked, and
continually expos'd to the heat of the Sun: 'tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
contrary to all Juſtice that they ſhould be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
with heavy Burdens far above their ſtrength,
as well as contrary to Charity, and the Cuſtom of all
reaſonable Men. All the ſervice theſe poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
do can't ſatisfy the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who therefore ſet
an Officer over 'em ſtrictly to inſpect their Actions,
and render their ſervitude ſtill more terrible. This
Employ is uſually beſtow'd on ſome cruel and inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Monſter, who always ſtands over 'em to make
'em work the harder, and punctually to obey all his
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57864:117"/>
Commands. The Executioners of the divine Wrath
in Hell can't be more wicked and hard-hearted than
this ſort of Men: They brand 'em with hot Irons,
and are continually beating and abuſing 'em; they
are not content to make 'em labor without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
and to ſet 'em unreaſonable Tasks, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
reproach and chide 'em while they undergo
this Toil, and beſides all this, violate their Wives
and Daughters, or make Preſents of many of 'em
together to their Maſters on whom they depend,
and who ſet 'em to work as ſo many principal Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
who alſo make it their buſineſs to invent cruel
and unſufferable Torments. And to hinder the
<hi>Indians</hi> from complaining of their Miſeries, they
threaten to inform againſt 'em, that they have ſeen
'em worſhip their Idols. This is the ſad ſtate to
which theſe People are reduc'd. They depend on
no leſs than four ſeveral Maſters, on your Majeſty,
their <hi>Caciques,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to whom they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlav'd,
and his Deputy, who is the greateſt Plague
to 'em that can be. Nay, 'tis impoſſible to tell how
many Maſters they have, ſeeing all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer
over 'em as ſo many Tyrants, robbing 'em
by turns, and making no ſcruple cruelly to abuſe and
murder 'em.</p>
                              <p>Seeing the preaching of the Orthodox Faith is
the only thing that could warrant the reduction of
the <hi>Indians</hi> to a ſtate of dependance on any foreign
Power, in order to their Converſion; and ſeeing
none can pretend on this account to be their lawful
Soveraign but your Majeſty; it follows that your
Majeſty ought with all your might to oppoſe the
Power which private Men aſſume over 'em, and
which can't be look'd upon as any better than Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.
Your Majeſty is oblig'd for the common
good of all your Subjects to eſtabliſh a regular and
ſtable form of Government among 'em, which may
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57864:117"/>
conduce to their Converſion and Salvation: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſoveraign and ſingle Power you have over
'em is ſufficient for the end propos'd, other Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
are not to be tolerated, becauſe they can
only prove burdenſom and incommodious, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the common Maxims of Government re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in the World, which will not allow a People
to be ſubject to ſeveral different Princes; much
leſs ſhould the <hi>Indians</hi> be thus ſubjected, becauſe of
their Poverty, Meekneſs, Patience, Humility, and
the tenderneſs of their Conſtitution, partly occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd
by their going naked, their unwholſom Food,
and the Labor they undergo to get their living.
After all this 'twould be ſufficiently tedious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy
to 'em if no other Duties were exacted of 'em
than thoſe which your Majeſty and their <hi>Caciques,</hi>
who are their immediat Princes, impoſe. How then
can they be able to endure thoſe exceſſive Tasks,
thoſe heavy Blows, Vexations and Abuſes of which
we have ſpoken above? If your Majeſty has a mind
to preſerve the <hi>Indians</hi> from utter Deſtruction, theſe
new Burdens ought not to be impos'd on 'em, nor
ſhould they be condemn'd to this ſevere Slavery.
This would be to violate the Laws of Juſtice and
Charity: For the Maſters of Policy and Prudence
uſually ſay, that tho a Prince require extraordinary
aſſiſtance of his Subjects in ſome preſſing Exigencies
of the Commonwealth; yet where theſe Subjects are
under other ſubordinate and immediate Lords, to
whom they are oblig'd to pay the ſame Duties, this
cannot be done, becauſe this would be to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
'em with endleſs Taxes: for 'tis contrary to
all Juſtice to oppreſs 'em with a double Burden, and
all good Laws formally condemn it; for the Rules
of Equity forbid all Oppreſſion and Injury. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſince the <hi>Indians</hi> are already bound to ſerve
their natural and immediate Princes, and to pay 'em
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57864:118"/>
all the homage and duty of Subjects, it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
to ſubject 'em to ſuch new Maſters as pretend to
a right of exacting new Services of 'em. The
Taxes that are impos'd on any Eſtate ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
to the Revenue that may be expected
from it; and there ought not to be more Homage
and Service annex'd to it than is reaſonable for
the advantage of him that owns that Eſtate. If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate
things have this privilege, how much more
ought it to be ſo with Men, who deſerve to be
us'd a little better? Since therefore your Majeſty's
Government alone is ſufficient for the welfare and
advantage of the <hi>Indians,</hi> to ſet other Lords over
'em would be to act contrary to Juſtice. For who
can deny it to be contrary to all the Laws of Equity,
to ſubject the <hi>Indians</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who mind no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but to raiſe Eſtates by making a Prey of 'em?
An 'tis as oppoſit to Charity to add new Burdens to
them that can ſcarce bear ſuch as are already im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
upon 'em, and to increaſe the Calamities of
ſuch as are ſufficiently beſet with Affliction, beſides
the pains they take for the ſubſiſtence of their Wives
and Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Charity teaches to do to others as
we would have them do to us, to ſecure 'em from
all the Evil we can, and to relieve 'em in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence
when they addreſs themſelves to us, and
ſhew us their Neceſſities, becauſe we our ſelves are
deſirous of the Aſſiſtance of others, when in diſtreſs.
The Laws of Chriſt are founded on ſuch Maxims as
theſe: <hi>Do to others what you would have others do to
you;</hi> and, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi>
in which one word, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, the whole Law is
contain'd. He farther ſays, <hi>Bear ye one another's
Burdens, and ſo fulfil the Law of Chriſt.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>It is to be conſider'd, that all the Inhabitants of
the New World are born free: Nor do they loſe
this Liberty in recognizing your Majeſty for their
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57864:118"/>
Soveraign, and univerſal Emperor of the <hi>Indies.</hi>
On the contrary, if there be any defects in their
Polity, your Majeſty's Government may ſupply 'em,
by which their Liberty will be render'd the more
compleat. This was the deſign of that moſt Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Princeſs, Queen <hi>Iſabella,</hi> as appears by all the
Writings ſhe left about this Affair. A few days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her Death ſhe commanded General <hi>d' Alcantara,</hi>
then Governor of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> to treat all the <hi>Indians</hi>
as a free People. And in a general Aſſembly of
Divines and Lawyers held at <hi>Burgos,</hi> his Catholic
Majeſty declar'd in Council, that the Inhabitants of
<hi>America</hi> were free, and commanded they ſhould be
treated as ſuch. The ſame was done by your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
after having conſulted the moſt learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
and Canoniſts in the year 1523.</p>
                              <p>Now if it be an inconteſtable Principle that all
the <hi>Indians</hi> are free, and that all of 'em that have
been, or ſhall be diſcover'd in time to come, can't be
ſubjected to any other Juriſdiction but that of your
Majeſty, and that they own to your Majeſty alone
that Homage and Obedience which free Cities and
Nations are oblig'd to pay their lawful Soveraign,
'tis moſt evident that no private Men can pretend
to the ſame. Nay, they are more free in reſpect
of us than other Nations, becauſe the Kings of
<hi>Spain</hi> have no Title to 'em as their Subjects by
right of Inheritance, or that of Purchaſe, or of
Conqueſt, as they might have had, if they had
been conquer'd in a lawful War, that had bin for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
declar'd, for the revenge of ſome great
Offence which the <hi>Indians</hi> might have commited
againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or againſt the univerſal
Church, or ſome very conſiderable Member of it,
for which they had refus'd Satisfaction when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded:
or if they had unjuſtly retain'd any Lands
or Goods of which they were unlawfully poſſeſs'd.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57864:119"/>
But on the contrary, they have frankly and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
ſubmitted themſelves to your Majeſty. And
yet they have bin hitherto not only neglected, but
treated by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as wild Beaſts are by Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
tho they never did any thing to deſerve ſuch
ill uſage. They have yet ſeen nothing to convince
'em of your Majeſty's Grandure, Juſtice, Goodneſs,
and Magnificence, having found nothing but Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
Violence, Injuſtice and Cruelty from the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> your Subjects, whoſe ill Actions and bad
Examples render 'em infamous; ſo that the <hi>Indians</hi>
look upon 'em as the vileſt of Men. And this makes
'em think upon the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> with horror,
who yet never gave 'em occaſion to entertain ſuch
thoughts of 'em. But they fancy your Majeſty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
knows all the ill treatment they endure, and
that 'tis by your Conſent and Approbation; they
believe 'tis all done by your order, and that you
give your Protection and Favour to thoſe that inſult
over 'em.</p>
                              <p>The Title your Majeſty has to the <hi>Indians</hi> is
founded only on the Obligation you have taken
upon your ſelf to have 'em inſtructed into the true
Faith, as appears by the Apoſtolic Briefs granted
on this account: which ought to engage your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to moderate your Government ſo much the
more, and to treat 'em with the greater tenderneſs
and kindneſs. The Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould ſignalize
the Firſt-fruits of their Soveraignty over the <hi>Indies,</hi>
by the tokens of Peace and Love to theſe People,
and by taking care to furniſh 'em with good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples:
In a word, they ought to treat 'em as their
Neighbors and natural Subjects, for fear the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of any Injuſtice or Cruelty among 'em ſhould
prejudice 'em againſt the Chriſtian Faith, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſe
'em to receive the Counſils and Maxims of
our Religion. There ſhould not be the leaſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57864:119"/>
given 'em on any account to blaſpheme the
Name of God, which would be an Obſtacle to the
great end of their Converſion. Nothing ſhould be
left undone, that may make 'em love your Majeſty,
and induce 'em to praiſe God on finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
under a Government ſo eaſy and commodious.
They deſerve in ſome reſpect to be dealt with after
this manner, becauſe of the freedom of their birth,
which makes it unjuſt for any to violate their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
'Tis neceſſary for the Honor of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Religion, that they embrace it voluntarily,
becauſe God himſelf will have men make a free
choice in matters of Religion; nor is any man
whatſoever to be treated with violence in this caſe,
and forc'd to embrace a Religion againſt his Will.
And temporal Princes commit a great piece of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
if they put a force on the minds of their
Subjects in a buſineſs wherein they ought to have an
entire liberty of Conſcience: they ſhould rather
obſerve the Rules which God, the Univerſal Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
of all his Creatures, has conſtituted. There
is no Power or Authority on Earth that has a right
to violate the Liberty of any People, becauſe 'tis
the moſt valuable thing they poſſeſs, and preferable
to all other things in the World. Hence it is there
are ſuch advantageous Conſtitutions in the Civil
Law in favor of Liberty. And the particular Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
of the Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> preſcribe that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be determin'd in prejudice of a Man's Liberty
in doubtful things, nor the leaſt force or conſtraint
put upon men that are free. And when their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to any thing is violently extorted, it ought not
to be imputed to 'em, becauſe 'tis an infringement
of the Law of Nature.</p>
                              <p>If 'tis unlawful to ſeize on the Goods of Men that
are free without cauſe, much more is it to offer
violence to their Perſons, and to inſlave 'em, which
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57864:120"/>
is the greateſt Injury they can receive next to the
loſs of Life it ſelf. If a Father can't chooſe himſelf
another Heir without the conſent of his Son, who
has a natural Title either to the whole, or at leaſt
a 4<hi>th</hi> part of his Father's Eſtate; much leſs may
inferior Lords pretend to a right of appropriating
the Kings Subjects to themſelves, unleſs his Majeſty
conſent by abandoning his own Right, which is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the voluntary Agreement of his Subjects. If
the current Mony of the Kingdom can't be alter'd
without the People's conſent, becauſe the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may be attended with great Inconveniences;
much leſs can the People themſelves be taken from
the Dominion of the King againſt their Will, and
ſubjected to the abſolute Power of private Maſters;
becauſe this forc'd Change is a Violation of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
It muſt be farther added, that ſuch as are
tributary to your Majeſty, can't paſs under the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of another Perſon, which would be more
uneaſy and diſadvantageous to 'em, and under which
they would perhaps be condemn'd to a more ſervile
and laborious Courſe of life. How much more
ought they who enjoy an entire liberty under any
Prince's Government, to be preſerv'd in the poſſeſſion
of their Privileges; and how injurious would it be
to deliver 'em up as Vaſſals to particular Lords,
who would probably abuſe their Authority, and
treat their Perſons with violence, as well as greatly
prejudice 'em in their Eſtates? 'Tis moſt injurious
both to the Lives and Liberties of Men, to depend
on divers Lords and Maſters, becauſe their Service
and Labors multiply according to the number of
thoſe under whoſe juriſdiction they are: And 'tis to
be preſum'd they will not be all alike juſt and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                              <p>'Tis very much the Intereſt of Princes, not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the number of their Subjects to be diminiſh'd,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:57864:120"/>
becauſe it will deprive 'em of much of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and ſervice they may reaſonably expect from
'em. And 'tis as much the Intereſt of Subjects, not
to ſuffer themſelves to be transfer'd from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of the Prince under which they have always
liv'd, to that of an inferior Maſter. Thoſe that
know the difference between the Government of
Kings, and that of particular Lords, which is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hard and ſevere, will do any thing to be ſecure
from the latter; while they are well pleas'd with
the former, and readily diſpoſe themſelves to bear
a Yoke that appears ſo much eaſier and lighter
than the other. And this is the reaſon why the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of Men do all they can to avoid falling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the dominion of private Men to the prejudice
of that Royal Juriſdiction to which they have been
continually accuſtom'd. And this Sentiment is juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
by the ſuffrage of all wiſe Men, and favor'd
by all juſt Laws.</p>
                              <p>'Tis a general Rule, that a Prince can do nothing
that may cauſe any conſiderable damage to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
unleſs they freely give their own conſent:
And this your Majeſty every day obſerves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you follow the ſteps of your Anceſtors, who to
avoid doing any thing contrary to the rules of Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
and Equity, frequently us'd to aſſemble their
Council, and to take their advice who were Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of great Wiſdom and Senſe, and to make a due
improvement of it. In the preſent affair, it would
be injurious to the <hi>Indians</hi> to give 'em up to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
as their Vaſſals, becauſe they uſe 'em ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly,
and reduce 'em to the utmoſt degree of
Servitude. And ſuch a matter as this is not to be
concluded, without propoſing it to the <hi>Indians,</hi> and
obtaining their conſent. For thus to change their
condition without conſulting 'em, were to put a
treacherous trick upon 'em againſt the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57864:121"/>
Juſtice and Charity, becauſe this ſubjection
would be to a ſevere and tyrannical Power; as is
evident by what the <hi>Indians</hi> have hitherto met with
from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Beſide, ſuch an alteration would
be contrary to the Will and Law of God, becauſe
it would hinder the progreſs of the Catholic Faith,
and inſpire the <hi>Indians</hi> with hatred to the Goſpel,
and would tend to the general deſtruction of thoſe
People whom your Majeſty is bound to preſerve and
protect. This you owe 'em from a motive of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Zeal for the good of your Neighbor, as you
are a Chriſtian Prince, and moreover by the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of your Office, as the Vice-gerent of Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
                              <p>From all the Reaſons alledg'd, it may well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that if even the <hi>Indians</hi> themſelves would
voluntarily conſent to be inſlav'd, and utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
their Liberty; yet this conſent of theirs
would be void and null of it ſelf, becauſe a thing
every way ſo miſchievous ought by no means to be
tolerated. Your Majeſty would be oblig'd by the
Law of God to hinder 'em from ruining themſelves
in ſuch a manner; becauſe the Tyranny the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
exerciſe over 'em is ſo great, that many of
the <hi>Indians</hi> have fallen into utter deſpair under their
unſufferable Impoſitions, and choſen rather to ſtab
or poiſon themſelves than to pine away gradually
under their miſerable Bondage: Others have fled
into the Mountains, where they have become a Prey
to Tigers and Lions; others have died merely with
Sorrow and Anguiſh, when they found they were
condemn'd to a Life ſo full of Miſery and Toil,
without any hope of reſpit or mitigation. I knew
a <hi>Spaniards</hi> who was ſo famous for his Cruelty, that
above two hundred People kill'd themſelves, ſome
one way and ſome another, to avoid his Barbarities
in <hi>Hiſpaniola:</hi> A like number underwent the ſame
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57864:121"/>
fate in the Iſle of <hi>Cuba,</hi> where this Tyrant exercis'd
his Violence and Rapine.</p>
                              <p>But tho the common Intereſt of all Nations in
the World ought to prevent their Kings from alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
them from their own Dominion to make 'em
the Vaſſals and Subjects of private Men, and tho this
is founded on natural Reaſon and Juſtice; yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in preſſing Exigencies Princes may alienate a
part of their Territories to extricate themſelves out
of ſome great and perplexing difficulty, from which
they cannot otherwiſe get free. For inſtance, if
they have no other courſe to take for the defence of
the Commonwealth, it ſeems lawful for 'em to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
the Juriſdiction they have over their Subjects,
provided they ſome way indemnify 'em, or repair
any damage this exchange may occaſion. But 'twould
be impoſſible to indemnify the <hi>Indians</hi> if they ſhould
be left to the Dominion of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who bring
upon 'em inexpreſſible Calamities and Miſchiefs, that
can never be repair'd by any advantage they may
allow 'em; for they take a courſe to deſtroy both
their Souls and Bodies. Therefore ſeeing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of the <hi>Indians</hi> depends principally on your
Majeſty's Title and Juriſdiction over 'em, you ought
not to do any thing that may blaſt the hope of this
Deſign, and will infallibly hinder theſe People from
embracing Chriſtianity. And it muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd
they have freely and willingly choſe your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
for their Soveraign, which is a kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
they have made with your Majeſty, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be violated without their Conſent, unleſs it be
to put 'em in a condition more eaſy, advantageous
and ſecure, than what they enjoy under your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Dominion. And your Majeſty is oblig'd to
promiſe and ſwear to 'em, that you will always
preſerve their Privileges, as they are ordinarily kept
in the generality of Kingdoms, when a free People
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57864:122"/>
ſubmit themſelves to the Government of a new
King. This Practice is almoſt as antient as the
World, for ever ſince Men began to ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon the face of the Earth, it has always been
the cuſtom of Princes to promiſe and ſwear to 'em to
employ all their Power in preſerving and defending
'em from Oppreſſion. Which evidently proves that
your Majeſty has not power to give up the <hi>Indians</hi>
to the abſolute Dominion of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who
have had the cruelty to deſtroy ſuch numerous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of 'em, without any legal Proceſs, or leave to
make their Defence. For it would be to act contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Law of God and Nature to expoſe 'em to
ſo many Miſeries, which are as ſo many invincible
Obſtructions to hinder 'em from turning Chriſtians.
Nor is there any Prince on Earth, who can juſtly
pretend to have ſuch a Power: for Soveraign
Princes have no Authority to do any thing that may
provoke the Juſtice of God, who has not ſet 'em
over their People for their ruin and deſtruction, or
for the overthrow of the Church; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
has ſet 'em in the World to defend the Church,
to bring their People to eſpouſe the true Faith, and
edify 'em in it.</p>
                              <p>Reaſon and the Law of Nature direct that thoſe
who have made an ill uſe of the Privileges granted
to 'em, ſhould be depriv'd of 'em. Now the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
allow'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> over the <hi>Indians</hi> was
only on condition they would inſtruct 'em in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and defend 'em from their Enemies; and they
have not only fallen ſhort of this Engagement, but
even barbarouſly abus'd thoſe they were oblig'd to
protect. 'Tis remarkable in the Laws of <hi>Spain,</hi>
that if a Maſter treats any one of his Slaves inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly,
he is oblig'd to ſell him, becauſe 'tis but juſt
that he who tyrannizes over his Subjects ſhould loſe
his Juriſdiction over 'em, which of right devolves
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57864:122"/>
on the Prince. He that abuſes his Title is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to poſſeſs it: and a Man neither owes Homage
nor Obedience to a Tyrant. So that your Majeſty
ought in quality of Soveraign Lord of the People
of the New World, to defend 'em, and do 'em
Juſtice, when they are wrong'd; and conſequently
to reſcue 'em from the power of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that
they may enjoy their Liberty.</p>
                              <p>'Tis moreover a Cuſtom eſtabliſh'd by the Laws
of <hi>Spain,</hi> That if the King grant any Privilege
contrary to the Catholic Faith, 'tis null and void, as
much as if it were contrary to the civil Good and
Welfare of the Kingdom, or to the Rights of any
particular Perſons. And the ſame account is to be
made of any Privilege given contrary to the Law
of Nature: as for example, if a King ſhould take
away any private Man's Eſtate, to beſtow it on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Therefore your Majeſty cannot diveſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Princes of the <hi>Indians</hi> of their Dominion over
'em, to inveſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with it, who not only are
Foreigners to 'em, but alſo treat 'em after a tyrannical
manner. 'Tis therefore neceſſary for your Majeſty
to revoke ſo unjuſt a Privilege, deſtructive to the
People, and directly oppoſit to the Catholic Faith,
as well as to your Majeſty's Service, the advantage
of your Kingdom in general, the good of many
Members of the Commonwealth in particular, and
which is contrary to Reaſon, and the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                              <p>'Tis farther conſtituted by the Cuſtoms of <hi>Spain,</hi>
in conformity to the Imperial Laws of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
as well as thoſe of the Church, that when a
Privilege in proceſs of time proves injurious, and
occaſions more hurt than good, it ought to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
aboliſh'd, without ſo much as conſulting
the Prince that granted it; becauſe from that very
moment wherein this Privilege began to be detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57864:123"/>
it ought to be ſuppos'd the Prince deſign'd
to revoke it: ſo that it can have no more force or
authority, becauſe not according to the Prince's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
who always ought to have Equity and the
Divine Will in view. Now ſince the Privilege
granted the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to ſubject the <hi>Indians</hi> as Vaſſals
is become ſo pernicious, and occaſions an irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
damage to the Chriſtian Religion, and to the
Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and has bin the cauſe of the ruin
of ſuch vaſt numbers of People, and of the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſome of the fineſt Countries in the World;
and ſeeing in all appearance it is the very reaſon of
thoſe Calamities with which God is now afflicting
<hi>Spain,</hi> 'tis neceſſary to apply a ſpeedy Remedy, and
to go to the root of the Diſeaſe, in revoking ſo
pernicious and tyrannical a Grant.</p>
                              <p>Beſides, the Dominion of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> over the
<hi>Indians</hi> has never bin judicially approv'd by the
Kings of <hi>Spain.</hi> He that firſt ſhar'd theſe poor
People among 'em, as if they had been ſo many
Sheep, had no order to make this diſtribution,
which abſolutely deſolated and unpeopled <hi>New Spain,</hi>
but exceeded the limits of his Power; ſo that no juſt
Conſequence can be drawn from what he did. It
was the great General <hi>d'Alcantara</hi> who began this
irregular courſe in <hi>America.</hi> In the year 1502, the
moſt ſerene King <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſent
General <hi>De-Larés</hi> from <hi>Grenada</hi> to govern the new
Conqueſts: At which time there were but three
hundred Chriſtians in the Iſland of <hi>Hiſpaniola.</hi> This
Governor was expreſly charg'd to treat the <hi>Indians</hi>
as free Nations; to be very kind, tender and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
toward 'em, to do 'em exact Juſtice on all
occaſions, and not to impoſe too ſevere a Yoke on
'em, or to inſlave 'em; in a word, to protect 'em
from all Injuries, leſt any Violence ſhould prove a
Stumbling-block to divert 'em from entertaining
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57864:123"/>
the Chriſtian Faith, and inſpire 'em with an averſion
to the Profeſſors of it. General <hi>De-Larés</hi> carried
with him three thouſand <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who landed at
<hi>St. Domingo,</hi> where they ſoon found themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to great ſtraits for want of Food. However,
the ſtrict Orders he had receiv'd would not permit
him to do any Violence to the <hi>Indians,</hi> or to infringe
their Liberty in the leaſt; upon which he writes
many things to the Queen againſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to render 'em odious to her by his Lies and
Slanders, that he might have leave to abuſe the poor
Wretches at his pleaſure. Among other things he
wrote, that it would be impoſſible to preach the
Chriſtian Faith to 'em as long as they were ſuffer'd
to enjoy an entire Freedom, becauſe they induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
avoided all manner of acquaintance with the
Chriſtians; in ſo much that they refus'd to work
for 'em, tho they offer'd 'em Wages for their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,
and choſe rather to wander up and down as
Vagabonds, than to keep company with Chriſtians
to inform themſelves of their Religion. As if he
thought the <hi>Indians</hi> were oblig'd to divine that
there was a new Religion to be preach'd to 'em,
which they ought to embrace; or that they ought,
as poor as they are, to forſake their Houſes, Wives
and Children, and to leave their Lands unmanur'd,
to come to ſeek the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and ſo expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to die with Hunger in a Journey it may be of
two hundred Leagues or more; or as if they were
under any obligation to undergo the fatigue of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Proviſion to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſuch a tedious way as
this.</p>
                              <p>His Majeſty, who was ſincerely zealous for the
Salvation of theſe Idolaters, and publiſhing the
Name of Chriſt in the New World, anſwer'd the
General after this manner: <q>We very ardently
deſire the Converſion of the <hi>Indians</hi> to our holy
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57864:124"/>
Faith, and that they be taught the Myſteries of
the Catholic Religion; and think it neceſſary to
the ſucceſs of this Deſign, that the <hi>Indians</hi> and
<hi>Spaniards</hi> converſe and live together. Therefore
we by theſe Preſents command you to oblige the
<hi>Indians</hi> to deal with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi>
and to have Converſation with 'em, to aſſiſt 'em
in building their Houſes, and in getting Gold and
other Metals out of the Mines, and to pay 'em
their Wages exactly, according to their labor
and deſert. You ſhall likewiſe order every <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cique</hi>
to have a certain number of <hi>Indians</hi> always
in a readineſs to be employ'd in ſuch Work as
ſhall be aſſign'd 'em, provided that care be taken
to preach to 'em, and inſtruct 'em in the Word
of God on all Holy-days, and that they be always
treated as Free-men, and not as Slaves; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
let them meet with no ill uſage, nor have any
occaſion to complain: Yet let ſome diſtinction be
ſtill made in favor of ſuch as embrace the Faith.
But let no Perſon be permitted to wrong 'em, or
give 'em the leaſt diſguſt in any thing whatſoever.</q>
Theſe are the very words of the Letter which the
King ſent to the Governor of the <hi>Indies,</hi> by which
his Majeſty ſufficiently ſignified that his principal
deſign in the <hi>Indies</hi> was the Salvation of thoſe Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
and that for that end they ſhould converſe
with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which plainly proves he had no
other regard to this Commerce betwixt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and theſe Infidels, but only as a neceſſary means
for their Converſion. And it muſt be farther ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
that when the King gives order to oblige
each <hi>Cacique</hi> to ſend the <hi>Spaniards</hi> a certain number
of <hi>Indians</hi> to work for 'em, on condition of being
paid for their Labor, he did not intend that all the
Men in the <hi>Indies</hi> ſhould be bound to perform ſuch
Tasks, much leſs that the Women, Children, old
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57864:124"/>
Men, and Chiefs of each Nation, whom the <hi>Indians</hi>
look upon as their natural Princes, ſhould be thus
treated. The King deſign'd there ſhould be due
conſideration had of their Neceſſities, that they
ſhould have liberty to provide for their Wives and
Children, and go every night home to refreſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with their Families, and ſleep in their own
Houſes. And it may be farther remark'd in the
King's Patent, that he did not in the leaſt deſign
the <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould be made to work every day and
without intermiſſion, ſeeing it provides they ſhould
be paid daily after their Labor; his intention was
that they ſhould be engag'd by fair means to do
what was requir'd of 'em, and not forc'd to it whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they would or no; in ſhort, that they ſhould
be us'd in all reſpects as a free People. Beſides, the
King commanded that all their Labors ſhould be
moderate, and proportionate to their Strength, and
that they ſhould reſt on Holy-days and Sundays, that
their Wages ſhould be ſutable to their Work, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to encourage 'em in taking pains, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their Families in all their domeſtick Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                              <p>If the King had a perfect account of the nature
of the Land in the <hi>Indies,</hi> of the Weakneſs, Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Meekneſs and good humor of the Inhabitants,
of the rigor and ſeverity of their Labors, and the
great difficulty of getting Gold out of the Mines;
if he knew the deſolate ſtate in which they are often
left, and the little care taken to engage 'em to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Sacraments before they die, he would
without doubt employ ſome effectual means to put
an end to theſe Diſorders. The firſt Admiral of
the <hi>Indies,</hi> who made the diſcovery of this New
World, though the acted conformably to the King's
Intereſt in rendering the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>New Spain</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary,
by obliging 'em to dig a certain quantity
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57864:125"/>
of Gold out of the Mines, and condemning others
that were remote from any Mines to other kinds of
Tribute. Some of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> he carried with
him, ſhook off the Obedience they ow'd the King,
and ſet up for ſo many Tyrants, committing Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and Spoil beyond what can be eaſily imagin'd
in the Province of <hi>Xavagua,</hi> one of the fineſt and
moſt populous Countries in the <hi>Indies.</hi> The King
being inform'd of theſe Ravages, wrote his mind
to General <hi>De-Larés,</hi> and order'd him to put a ſtop
to the Cruelty and Violence of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the
<hi>Indians,</hi> and to govern 'em as a free People, which
Orders were not well executed: For the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
ſhut up the <hi>Indians</hi> by force in the Mines, to employ
'em in the toilſom work of digging for Gold, which
requires a very robuſt Conſtitution: And when
they had got this Gold, they were forc'd to be all
day in the Water to waſh it. At firſt the <hi>Indians</hi>
were kept in the Mines for a whole year, till the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> found they were not able to endure ſuch
hard and continual Labor, and therefore gave 'em
ſome time of reſpite, contenting themſelves to
keep 'em only for five Months in digging Gold, after
which they employ'd 'em forty days in melting it.
This they pretended was a time of reſt for theſe
poor Creatures, tho this latter ſort of Work is
more toilſom than that of grubbing up of Roots,
and clearing Ground that is over-run with Wood:
ſo that they don't know what a Holy-day or Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
means throughout the whole year. They are
ſometimes almoſt famiſh'd, having nothing given
'em ſave a few dry Roots that yield but little Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment:
Tho the moſt liberal of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
a Porker once a week among half a hundred
<hi>Indians,</hi> which is little more than every one a taſte.
Nay ſome of 'em have not been willing to give the
<hi>Indians</hi> that ſerv'd 'em any thing at all to eat, but
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57864:125"/>
out of mere Avarice ſent 'em to feed like Beaſts in
the fields, or to gather fruit upon the Mountains,
after which they forc'd 'em to work two or three
days together without eating. One Man frankly
confeſs'd to me that he had got a great Eſtate in a
little time by this kind of frugality. What ſtrength
can Bodies that are naturally of a tender Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be ſuppos'd to have when fed after this manner,
and oppreſs'd beſides with exceſſive Labor? 'Tis
impoſſible they ſhould ſubſiſt long under this cruel
Bondage; which makes 'em lead a ſorrowful, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
and miſerable Life, being deſtitute both of
convenient Food and Reſt.</p>
                              <p>Tho the King order'd each <hi>Indian</hi> to be paid in
proportion to his Work, that they might have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to live on, and be capable of buying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Neceſſaries; this Command has been ill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
for they had nothing at all for many years;
ſo that they were put to the greateſt Extremity,
and ſuffer'd Hunger to that degree that they deſir'd
nothing more than to die, that they might find an
end of their Miſeries. Theſe are the Calamities
the poor <hi>Indians</hi> have ſuffer'd in the Service of
Chriſtians, who have had no regard either to their
Souls or Bodies.</p>
                              <p>As for thoſe Orders that have been given the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> to treat the <hi>Indians</hi> as a free People, not
to over-charge 'em with Labor, not to do 'em any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Injuſtice, and to let 'em mind their own Affairs,
and order their buſineſs as they ſaw good, they have
bin no more heeded than the other. For they have
been made mere Slaves, and certainly have not ſo
much liberty as Beaſts. And the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as good
Chriſtians as they are, are not at all mov'd by all
the Calamities theſe poor Wretches undergo, but look
upon them as the vileſt of Slaves, and not fit to have
the liberty of doing any thing they have a mind to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57864:126"/>
do. They are conſtantly expos'd to the Cruelty of
theſe Tyrants, and not treated like human Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but wild Beaſts, who are kept in Chains by
their Owners, and diſpos'd of at their pleaſure.
If they ſometimes let 'em go to their own Country,
they will not ſuffer 'em to carry their Wives and
Children with 'em, nor hardly any thing to eat; ſo
that they are preſently conſtrain'd to return, while
the Reflection they make on their deplorable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
often makes 'em deſire death to relieve 'em.
If the exceſſive Labors impos'd on 'em make 'em
ſick, as it often happens (becauſe, as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
the natural Temper of their Bodies is none
of the ſtrongeſt) the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do not in the leaſt
pity their Condition, but oppreſs 'em with intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Tasks, reproaching 'em as lazy, and only
feigning themſelves ill to be excus'd from Labor.
And when they ſee their Sickneſs increaſe, ſo that
they become unſerviceable, they ſend 'em to their
own Country, which is ſometimes forty or fifty
Leagues diſtance, giving 'em nothing but a few ſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Roots to eat by the way, ſo that they often die
miſerably, not being able to accompliſh ſuch a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
Sometimes we find ſome of 'em on the Road
juſt ready to expire, others groaning hideouſly in
the Agonies of Death, and others quite dead. Thoſe
of 'em that are able to ſpeak, ſay nothing but <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
Hunger.</hi> Your Majeſty by this account may ſee
that the Governor of the New World had little
regard to the Orders that were given him, to treat
the <hi>Indians</hi> as a free People.</p>
                              <p>That Governor was expreſly charg'd not to do
any thing to the <hi>Indians</hi> that might hinder 'em from
receiving the Principles of the Chriſtian Religion,
or prejudice their Lives or Health, becauſe the King
had no deſign to deſtroy 'em: yet this Man ſaw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit
numbers of 'em periſh that were imploy'd in
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57864:126"/>
melting of Gold. The Labors exacted of 'em were
like a furious Peſtilence, which cuts off multitudes
of People in a little time; and yet this ſad Spectacle
could not engage him to revoke his cruel Orders,
or ſo much as mitigate the ſeverity of 'em. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he knew well enough that he was not able to
excuſe his Proceedings either before God or the
King, being expreſly contrary to the Charge that
had been given him; and therefore us'd ſo much
Subtilty and Artifice in the management of this
Affair, that none of his Cruelties on the <hi>Indians</hi>
were known in <hi>Spain</hi> for thoſe ſeven years in which
he tyranniz'd over the New World. They that
came after him, trod in his ſteps by deſtroying the
<hi>Indians,</hi> tho his Catholic Majeſty recommended it
to 'em to induce the <hi>Indians</hi> to receive the Catholic
Faith, by ſhewing all kindneſs to 'em, and not to
make War upon 'em on the account of Religion, or
to conſtrain 'em to embrace Chriſtianity by force,
but rather to treat 'em as the King's Liege People,
impoſing a certain Tribute on 'em, as on his other
Subjects. All this was expreſs'd in the Inſtructions
given to <hi>Pedrarias,</hi> when he was made Governor of
the <hi>Indies;</hi> notwithſtanding which he enter'd <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi>
juſt as a hungry Wolf falls on a flock of Sheep,
and made horrible ſlaughters on all ſides, uſing ſuch
unheard of Torments, and making ſuch waſte and
ſpoil, that nothing like it is to be found in any
Hiſtory. He might have been look'd upon as a
heavy Plague, ſent by God to execute his Wrath in
extirpating the <hi>Indians.</hi> This Man, and thoſe that
accompanied him, cheated your Majeſty of five or
ſix Millions of Gold, and 'tis impoſſible to compute
the Spoil they made in the <hi>Indies.</hi> They depopulated
a Country of above four hundred Leagues, as rich,
fertil and pleaſant as any in the World. All this
Tyranny was us'd to make the <hi>Indians</hi> deliver up
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57864:127"/>
all their Gold: But by the juſt Judgment of God
they made no great advantage of their Robberies;
and it would have bin more for their intereſt to
have kept the <hi>Indians</hi> alive, and to have made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Profit out of their hard Labors. If a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
account ſhould be given your Majeſty of all
the Diſorders committed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the
noble Province of <hi>Nicaraqua,</hi> your Majeſty would
be aſtoniſh'd; and if they had not ſtill continued
their Tyranny over theſe poor People, every day
killing and deſtroying 'em, I ſhould not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
my ſelf to the fatigue of ſo tedious and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom
a Voyage, to give your Majeſty an account
of it. When your Majeſty is aſſur'd that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
have depopulated ſo many vaſt and noble King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and that they ſtill continue to deſtroy what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
eſcap'd the fury of former Governors; when
you are convinc'd that they have carried Fire and
Sword through ſeven Kingdoms that are larger than
<hi>Spain,</hi> your Majeſty will eaſily be perſwaded that
what I have ſaid is no Exaggeration. I have ſeen
theſe Kingdoms in a manner as full of People as
Hives are of Bees, where now there are none to be
found, having been all murder'd by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi>
ſo that there are only naked Walls and empty
Houſes to be ſeen in many once populous Cities.
The Orders given by the moſt Catholic Queen <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
to General <hi>De-Larés</hi> were very prudent and
uſeful, but he did not think fit to obſerve 'em; and
the Relation he gave the King and Queen of matters
from time to time, were very far from Truth, tho
ſupported by the Teſtimony of divers <hi>Indians.</hi> He
acted quite contrary to the Inſtructions given him,
violating all the Rules of the Law of Nature and
Reaſon; by which 'tis evident he went beyond his
Commiſſion, and prevaricated in thoſe Letters he
directed to the Council of <hi>Spain,</hi> by intermixing

Falſhoods in his account, and diſguiſing what was
true. And 'tis certain if your Majeſty had been
inform'd how tyrannically this Governor treated
the <hi>Indians,</hi> you would never have entruſted your
Authority in his hands; and by conſequence your
Majeſty is oblig'd to declare that you deteſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of this Governor as injuſt and tyrannical,
and to abrogate all he has done, and declare that
the <hi>Indians</hi> ought not to have been ſubjected to the
Dominion of particular Men, and that all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
they have ſuffer'd are contrary to the Law of
God and Nature, as well as to the Imperial and
Canon Laws; ſeeing they have been tormented in
their Perſons, moleſted in their Liberty and Eſtates,
and condemn'd to die. Your Majeſty is oblig'd, as
you are a juſt Prince, and an Enemy to Violence, to
ſuppreſs theſe vexatious Practices, and to deliver the
poor <hi>Indians</hi> from the Tyranny of thoſe that have
oppreſs'd and tormented 'em.</p>
                              <p>If your Majeſty neglect to take this cruel Yoke
from their Necks, they will infallibly periſh. And
that lovely Country which is naturally fruitful and
populous will ſoon become a vaſt Deſert; for the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> that go thither, don't go to people the
Country, but to inrich themſelves by pillaging it.
Thoſe that have lately gon into <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> and
other depopulated places, and carried thither the
Commodities of <hi>Europe,</hi> have not been able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of 'em, there not being People to buy 'em: So
that theſe Diſorders are directly oppoſite to your
Majeſty's Intereſt; for what advantage can you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from the ruin of thoſe People? And what will
the World ſay of ſo juſt a Prince as your Majeſty,
if when you are inform'd of the miſchief don by
your Subjects in thoſe vaſt Kingdoms, and among
ſuch multitudes of People, you ſhould not apply ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Remedies to ſo dangerous a Diſeaſe? It can't
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57864:128"/>
of Gold out of the Mines, and condemning others
that were remote from any Mines to other kinds of
Tribute. Some of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> he carried with
him, ſhook off the Obedience they ow'd the King,
and ſet up for ſo many Tyrants, committing Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and Spoil beyond what can be eaſily imagin'd
in the Province of <hi>Xavagua,</hi> one of the fineſt and
moſt populous Countries in the <hi>Indies.</hi> The King
being inform'd of theſe Ravages, wrote his mind
to General <hi>De-Larés,</hi> and order'd him to put a ſtop
to the Cruelty and Violence of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the
<hi>Indians,</hi> and to govern 'em as a free People, which
Orders were not well executed: For the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
ſhut up the <hi>Indians</hi> by force in the Mines, to employ
'em in the toilſom work of digging for Gold, which
requires a very robuſt Conſtitution: And when
they had got this Gold, they were forc'd to be all
day in the Water to waſh it. At firſt the <hi>Indians</hi>
were kept in the Mines for a whole year, till the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> found they were not able to endure ſuch
hard and continual Labor, and therefore gave 'em
ſome time of reſpite, contenting themſelves to
keep 'em only for five Months in digging Gold, after
which they employ'd 'em forty days in melting it.
This they pretended was a time of reſt for theſe
poor Creatures, tho this latter ſort of Work is
more toilſom than that of grubbing up of Roots,
and clearing Ground that is over-run with Wood:
ſo that they don't know what a Holy-day or Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
means throughout the whole year. They are
ſometimes almoſt famiſh'd, having nothing given
'em ſave a few dry Roots that yield but little Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment:
Tho the moſt liberal of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
a Porker once a week among half a hundred
<hi>Indians,</hi> which is little more than every one a taſte.
Nay ſome of 'em have not been willing to give the
<hi>Indians</hi> that ſerv'd 'em any thing at all to eat, but
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57864:128"/>
out of mere Avarice ſent 'em to feed like Beaſts in
the fields, or to gather fruit upon the Mountains,
after which they forc'd 'em to work two or three
days together without eating. One Man frankly
confeſs'd to me that he had got a great Eſtate in a
little time by this kind of frugality. What ſtrength
can Bodies that are naturally of a tender Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be ſuppos'd to have when fed after this manner,
and oppreſs'd beſides with exceſſive Labor? 'Tis
impoſſible they ſhould ſubſiſt long under this cruel
Bondage; which makes 'em lead a ſorrowful, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
and miſerable Life, being deſtitute both of
convenient Food and Reſt.</p>
                              <p>Tho the King order'd each <hi>Indian</hi> to be paid in
proportion to his Work, that they might have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to live on, and be capable of buying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Neceſſaries; this Command has been ill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
for they had nothing at all for many years;
ſo that they were put to the greateſt Extremity,
and ſuffer'd Hunger to that degree that they deſir'd
nothing more than to die, that they might find an
end of their Miſeries. Theſe are the Calamities
the poor <hi>Indians</hi> have ſuffer'd in the Service of
Chriſtians, who have had no regard either to their
Souls or Bodies.</p>
                              <p>As for thoſe Orders that have been given the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> to treat the <hi>Indians</hi> as a free People, not
to over-charge 'em with Labor, not to do 'em any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Injuſtice, and to let 'em mind their own Affairs,
and order their buſineſs as they ſaw good, they have
bin no more heeded than the other. For they have
been made mere Slaves, and certainly have not ſo
much liberty as Beaſts. And the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as good
Chriſtians as they are, are not at all mov'd by all
the Calamities theſe poor Wretches undergo, but look
upon them as the vileſt of Slaves, and not fit to have
the liberty of doing any thing they have a mind to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57864:129"/>
do. They are conſtantly expos'd to the Cruelty of
theſe Tyrants, and not treated like human Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but wild Beaſts, who are kept in Chains by
their Owners, and diſpos'd of at their pleaſure.
If they ſometimes let 'em go to their own Country,
they will not ſuffer 'em to carry their Wives and
Children with 'em, nor hardly any thing to eat; ſo
that they are preſently conſtrain'd to return, while
the Reflection they make on their deplorable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
often makes 'em deſire death to relieve 'em.
If the exceſſive Labors impos'd on 'em make 'em
ſick, as it often happens (becauſe, as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
the natural Temper of their Bodies is none
of the ſtrongeſt) the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do not in the leaſt
pity their Condition, but oppreſs 'em with intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Tasks, reproaching 'em as lazy, and only
feigning themſelves ill to be excus'd from Labor.
And when they ſee their Sickneſs increaſe, ſo that
they become unſerviceable, they ſend 'em to their
own Country, which is ſometimes forty or fifty
Leagues diſtance, giving 'em nothing but a few ſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Roots to eat by the way, ſo that they often die
miſerably, not being able to accompliſh ſuch a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
Sometimes we find ſome of 'em on the Road
juſt ready to expire, others groaning hideouſly in
the Agonies of Death, and others quite dead. Thoſe
of 'em that are able to ſpeak, ſay nothing but <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
Hunger.</hi> Your Majeſty by this account may ſee
that the Governor of the New World had little
regard to the Orders that were given him, to treat
the <hi>Indians</hi> as a free People.</p>
                              <p>That Governor was expreſly charg'd not to do
any thing to the <hi>Indians</hi> that might hinder 'em from
receiving the Principles of the Chriſtian Religion,
or prejudice their Lives or Health, becauſe the King
had no deſign to deſtroy 'em: yet this Man ſaw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit
numbers of 'em periſh that were imploy'd in
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57864:129"/>
melting of Gold. The Labors exacted of 'em were
like a furious Peſtilence, which cuts off multitudes
of People in a little time; and yet this ſad Spectacle
could not engage him to revoke his cruel Orders,
or ſo much as mitigate the ſeverity of 'em. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he knew well enough that he was not able to
excuſe his Proceedings either before God or the
King, being expreſly contrary to the Charge that
had been given him; and therefore us'd ſo much
Subtilty and Artifice in the management of this
Affair, that none of his Cruelties on the <hi>Indians</hi>
were known in <hi>Spain</hi> for thoſe ſeven years in which
he tyranniz'd over the New World. They that
came after him, trod in his ſteps by deſtroying the
<hi>Indians,</hi> tho his Catholic Majeſty recommended it
to 'em to induce the <hi>Indians</hi> to receive the Catholic
Faith, by ſhewing all kindneſs to 'em, and not to
make War upon 'em on the account of Religion, or
to conſtrain 'em to embrace Chriſtianity by force,
but rather to treat 'em as the Kings's Liege People,
impoſing a certain Tribute on 'em, as on his other
Subjects. All this was expreſs'd in the Inſtructions
given to <hi>Pedrarias,</hi> when he was made Governor of
the <hi>Indies;</hi> notwithſtanding which he enter'd <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi>
juſt as a hungry Wolf falls on a flock of Sheep,
and made horrible ſlaughters on all ſides, uſing ſuch
unheard of Torments, and making ſuch waſte and
ſpoil, that nothing like it is to be found in any
Hiſtory. He might have been look'd upon as a
heavy Plague, ſent by God to execute his Wrath in
extirpating the <hi>Indians.</hi> This Man, and thoſe that
accompanied him, cheated your Majeſty of five or
ſix Millions of Gold, and 'tis impoſſible to compute
the Spoil they made in the <hi>Indies.</hi> They depopulated
a Country of above four hundred Leagues, as rich,
fertil and pleaſant as any in the World. All this
Tyranny was us'd to make the <hi>Indians</hi> deliver up
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57864:130"/>
all their Gold: But by the juſt Judgment of God
they made no great advantage of their Robberies:
and it would have bin more for their intereſt to
have kept the <hi>Indians</hi> alive, and to have made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Profit out of their hard Labors. If a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
account ſhould be given your Majeſty of all
the Diſorders committed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the
noble Province of <hi>Nicaraqua,</hi> your Majeſty would
be aſtoniſh'd; and if they had not ſtill continued
their Tyranny over theſe poor People, every day
killing and deſtroying 'em, I ſhould not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
my ſelf to the fatigue of ſo tedious and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom
a Voyage, to give your Majeſty an account
of it. When your Majeſty is aſſur'd that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
have depopulated ſo many vaſt and noble King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and that they ſtill continue to deſtroy what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
eſcap'd the fury of former Governors; when
you are convinc'd that they have carried Fire and
Sword through ſeven Kingdoms that are larger than
<hi>Spain,</hi> your Majeſty will eaſily be perſwaded that
what I have ſaid is no Exaggeration. I have ſeen
theſe Kingdoms in a manner as full of People as
Hives are of Bees, where now there are none to be
found, having been all murder'd by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi>
ſo that there are only naked Walls and empty
Houſes to be ſeen in many once populous Cities.
The Orders given by the moſt Catholic Queen <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
to General <hi>De-Larés</hi> were very prudent and
uſeful, but he did not think fit to obſerve 'em; and
the Relation he gave the King and Queen of matters
from time to time, were very far from Truth, tho
ſupported by the Teſtimony of divers <hi>Indians.</hi> He
acted quite contrary to the Inſtructions given him,
violating all the Rules of the Law of Nature and
Reaſon; by which 'tis evident he went beyond his
Commiſſion, and prevaricated in thoſe Letters he
directed to the Council of <hi>Spain,</hi> by intermixing
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57864:130"/>
Falſhoods in his account, and diſguiſing what was
true. And 'tis certain if your Majeſty had been
inform'd how tyrannically this Governor treated
the <hi>Indians,</hi> you would never have entruſted your
Authority in his hands; and by conſequence your
Majeſty is oblig'd to declare that you deteſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of this Governor as injuſt and tyrannical,
and to abrogate all he has done, and declare that
the <hi>Indians</hi> ought not to have been ſubjected to the
Dominion of particular Men, and that all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
they have ſuffer'd are contrary to the Law of
God and Nature, as well as to the Imperial and
Canon Laws; ſeeing they have been tormented in
their Perſons, moleſted in their Liberty and Eſtates,
and condemn'd to die. Your Majeſty is oblig'd, as
you are a juſt Prince, and an Enemy to Violence, to
ſuppreſs theſe vexatious Practices, and to deliver the
poor <hi>Indians</hi> from the Tyranny of thoſe that have
oppreſs'd and tormented 'em.</p>
                              <p>If your Majeſty neglect to take this cruel Yoke
from their Necks, they will infallibly periſh. And
that lovely Country which is naturally fruitful and

if when you are inform'd of the miſchief don by

Remedies to ſo dangerous a Diſeaſe? it can't
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57864:131"/>
be thought that your Majeſty, whoſe Mind abounds
with ſo much Goodneſs, and ſo great a Zeal for
Equity and Juſtice, can tolerate ſuch cruel Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as theſe.</p>
                              <p>To what has been ſaid, it may be added, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
that the power the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have over
the <hi>Indians</hi> is prejudicial to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi>
that by this means your Majeſty loſes an infinit
number of Subjects, who are every day cut off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any lawful occaſion; whereas if ſuffer'd to live,
they would chearfully ſubmit to your Majeſty's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
when they ſaw the difference between
your Majeſty's Yoke, and that Slavery in which
they are held by their private Maſters. If your
Majeſty had once receiv'd 'em into the number of
your Subjects, ſo that they might be ſecur'd from
the inhuman Severities they now daily endure, they
would love and ſerve your Majeſty with incredible
Zeal, being naturally inclin'd to be very ſubmiſſive
to their Princes.</p>
                              <p>Your Majeſty may farther conſider, that you loſe
immenſe Riches by the cruel depopulation of the
<hi>Indies,</hi> which otherwiſe you might juſtly acquire;
for 'tis impoſſible for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to ſubſiſt long in
the <hi>Indies,</hi> if the Natives be exterminated. And
thoſe Treaſures ſufficient to enrich all <hi>Spain,</hi> would
be no ſmall advantage to promote your Deſigns, and
enable you to reſiſt your Enemies. If there come
no Mony from the <hi>Indies,</hi> but that Spring of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
be ſuffer'd to dry up, <hi>Spain</hi> muſt neceſſarily
ſuſtain great Inconveniences for want of it. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
already ſhews that the <hi>Indies</hi> don't furniſh
us with ſo great a quantity as in time paſt, and 'tis
likely to diminiſh more and more for time to come.
Beſides, the manner of extorting it from the <hi>Indians</hi>
can't poſſibly laſt long, becauſe 'tis too violent a
courſe. The Iſle of <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> is an unexceptionable
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57864:131"/>
Inſtance of what I ſay; for whereas above three
Millions of very fine Gold were drawn out of it at
firſt, it cannot now afford the tenth part of that
Sum. The leaſt Reflection your Majeſty can make
will eaſily convince you how your Revenues every
day diminiſh. Your Majeſty has nothing certain and
ſtable in the <hi>Indies,</hi> if the Land be not cultivated,
and the Inhabitants preſerv'd for thoſe Labors that
are ſo advantageous. You have now but a ſmall
number of <hi>Indians</hi> in all <hi>New Spain,</hi> from whence
your Majeſty might annually have drawn a Million
of Ducats, if the <hi>Indians</hi> had been preſerv'd, and
your Majeſty's Intereſt at firſt regarded. There
have been yet greater Confuſions and Diſorders in
<hi>Peru,</hi> and the Miſchief daily increaſes; from which
Kingdom your Majeſty might yearly receive two or
three Millions of Gold if the <hi>Indians</hi> were not
treated with ſo much Injuſtice and Inhumanity, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of 'em having been murder'd, togther with their
great King <hi>Atabalipa.</hi> All the Gold the Chriſtians
have taken by force in <hi>Peru</hi> would of right have
belong'd to your Majeſty, becauſe that <hi>Indian</hi> Prince
would have voluntarily preſented himſelf to your
Majeſty with all his Treaſures. The Church has
likewiſe receiv'd great damage by theſe Cruelties;
for as your Majeſty has been fruſtrated of thoſe
immenſe Riches, ſo the Church has loſt an infinit
number of Souls who have periſh'd in their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
when they might have been taught the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of our Faith: ſo that the Loſſes ſuſtain'd both
by Church and State are irreparable.</p>
                              <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> which your Majeſty rules
with ſo much Equity, is ſurrounded with Enemies,
and in danger of being waſted and ruin'd by the
<hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> thoſe declar'd Enemies of the
Catholic Faith: Becauſe God, who is the juſt Judg
and Soveraign Lord of the Univerſe, is grievouſly
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57864:132"/>
offended with the Violence and Maſſacres which the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> have committed in the <hi>Indies,</hi> where they
have oppreſt and ſlaughter'd innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of People. Theſe <hi>Indians</hi> have rational Souls
form'd after the image and likeneſs of God, and
ranſom'd by the Blood of his Son, who keeps an
account of 'em, and will not think 'em of no value,
how ignorant and barbarous ſoever they ſeem to
be. He was pleas'd to chooſe <hi>Spain</hi> to the Service
of carrying the Light of the Goſpel into the New
World, and to engage thoſe Nations to entertain
the Chriſtian Faith. And it ſeem'd as if the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
had diſcover'd all theſe Temporal Riches to
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as a recompenſe for thoſe Spiritual
Pleaſures with which they were to enrich the <hi>Indies.</hi>
But tho he open'd a way for 'em into thoſe vaſt
Regions, ſo wealthy, fertil and pleaſant, ſo full of
Mines of Gold, Silver and precious Stones; inſtead
of being thankful for all theſe Favors, they have
committed the moſt hainous Crimes to provoke him.
Now 'tis uſual for God to diſtribute his Puniſhments
by a rule of proportion, adjuſting them to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Offence. If Men ſin by Pride, he covers
'em with Confuſion and Shame; if they get any
thing unjuſtly through Avarice, he often ſuffers 'em
to loſe their own Goods; and they that have ſtolen,
are in turn rob'd themſelves. Thoſe that oppreſs
and murder others, he permits to fall into the hands
of ſuch as treat 'em with the like Cruelty: They
that take away their Neighbors Wives and violate
'em, have ſometimes the ſame Outrages committed
on their own. And ſuch as uſurp Kingdoms that
don't belong to 'em, by God's Judgment come to
ſee their own Kingdoms invaded by their Enemies;
and thus it is with other Judgments which frequently
anſwer the different kinds of Sin. The Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and other Hiſtories are full of Inſtances to this
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57864:132"/>
purpoſe; and Experience every day furniſhes us
with ſuch marks of the Divine Diſpleaſure as theſe.
The <hi>Moors</hi> once over-run <hi>Spain,</hi> and this was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
as a Judgment from God to puniſh the
Crime of King <hi>Roderick,</hi> who raviſh'd the Daughter
of Count <hi>Don Julian,</hi> tho 'tis more probable it was
to puniſh the Crimes of the People of <hi>Spain,</hi> and
the Injuries they offer'd their Neighbours, and that
the Crime of this King only fill'd up the meaſure of
thoſe Vices.</p>
                              <p>'Tis convenient to inform your Majeſty what is
thought by Perſons of the beſt ſenſe, who are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
by no Prejudice, but only compaſſionate the
Sufferings of the poor <hi>Indians.</hi> I have heard many
ſuch Perſons ſay, I pray God theſe extravagant
Cruelties don't one day fall heavy upon <hi>Spain!</hi> It
may be ſuch words as theſe that drop from many
wiſe Men, are ſo many Advertiſements and Menaces
from God, who has been highly incens'd againſt this
Nation by the Crimes of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> And we
already ſee that <hi>Spain</hi> is reduc'd to great Neceſſities,
and Mony is very ſcarce among us; tho more Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
have bin brought hither than <hi>Solomon</hi> poſſeſs'd
in all his Glory: Moſt of thoſe that have brought
theſe Riches from the <hi>Indies</hi> have made a miſerable
end, and their Children are reduc'd to extreme
Poverty, which juſtifies the old Maxim, <hi>Vix gaudet
tertius Haeres,</hi> the third Heir ſeldom enjoys an ill-gotten
Eſtate; and that Paſſage of holy Scripture,
<hi>He that oppreſſeth the poor to increaſe his Riches—ſhall
ſurely come to want,</hi> Prov. 22. 16. Becauſe, as has
bin ſaid, the Divine Judgments bear ſome propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Crimes that Men commit. If your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
have the curioſity to inform your ſelf of the
detail of all theſe matters, we can ſhew you a Liſt
of the principal Tyrants that have committed the
greateſt Diſorders in the <hi>Indies,</hi> by pillaging and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57864:133"/>
maſſacring thoſe poor People, and have themſelves
all died in a dreadful and deſpairing manner. It
ſeems their Violence and Cruelty, the great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Blood ſhed in the Maſſacres they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
and their other vicious Actions, the effects
of which are yet to be ſeen, cry aloud to Heaven
for Vengeance; while the Tears, and Sighs, and
Entreaties of ſo many poor Innocents have filled
Heaven and Earth, and put all the World into a
Conſternation, to the utter ſhame and reproach of
all the Spaniſh Nation, and of the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi>
too. Since then it depends only on your Majeſty to
lay the Ax to the Root of all theſe Diſorders, and to
do Juſtice to theſe afflicted People, it will be an
Argument of your Prudence and Equity to employ
your Power to deliver the <hi>Indians</hi> from the terrible
Oppreſſions and Calamities under which they yet
groan.</p>
                              <p>Your Majeſty may be pleas'd farther to obſerve,
that if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have an Authority given 'em
over the <hi>Indians,</hi> however it may be qualified, they
will infallibly abuſe it; for being naturally proud,
they'l become ſtill leſs obedient to your Majeſty's
Commands: Nay the immenſe Sums which they'l
get in the <hi>Indies</hi> will enable 'em to confederate
with other Nations, to withdraw their Allegiance
entirely from your Majeſty at long-run, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
one another in their Rebellion. We already
ſee that the richeſt of 'em, that flatter themſelves
with the Title of Conquerors, are ſo intolerably
preſumptuous, as to ſet themſelves above the Rules
of common Juſtice. Your Majeſty's Vice-roy ſaid
not long ſince in one of his Letters, that the <hi>Indians</hi>
ought to acknowlege no other God nor King than
himſelf. Your Majeſty therefore ſhould take it for
granted that it is not conſiſtent with the Security of
your Government, that there ſhould be any great
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57864:133"/>
Lord in the Continent of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> inveſted
with an abſolute Juriſdiction over the <hi>Indians;</hi> this
Power ought to be inſeparable from your Royal
Perſon: 'Tis not convenient for the future to give
any one the Title of Count, Marqueſs, or Duke over
either the <hi>Indians</hi> or <hi>Spaniards</hi> that are ſetled there;
becauſe 'twill prompt 'em to think too highly of
themſelves, and to advance themſelves above their
Condition, which may have very miſchievous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences:
In a word, this may probably open 'em
a way to make themſelves Kings of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and
thereby deveſt your Majeſty of the Right you have
to thoſe Countries.</p>
                              <p>Nor will it be more ſafe to truſt this Power in
the hands of thoſe Gentlemen that compoſe your
Majeſty's Council in the <hi>Indies,</hi> which may alſo be
attended with Inconveniences; for 'tis impoſſible
for the Affairs of <hi>America</hi> to be well adminiſtred if
the Members of that Council be abſolute Lords of
the <hi>Indians:</hi> To be ſure then the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
ſhall never know the truth of what paſſes there;
this would produce nothing but Fraud and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture,
and be an infallible means to compleat the
Ruin of the <hi>Indies.</hi> They that govern in the <hi>Indies,</hi>
induſtriouſly endeavour to prevent the Court of
<hi>Spain</hi> from receiving any true Information how
matters ſtand there, that they may ſecurely pillage
the Country, and live at their own Diſcretion.
They have oppos'd thoſe Friers whoſe Zeal carried
'em to <hi>America</hi> to preach, and have hinder'd 'em from
reaping the fruit they might have expected from
their Labors. The Judges and other Officers were
afraid the Converſion of the <hi>Indians</hi> would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to their Temporal Intereſt; and Avarice
bore ſway in their Minds inſtead of that Zeal they
ought to have had for the Salvation of thoſe Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.
God is witneſs that this is true, and 'tis not
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57864:134"/>
difficult to prove it. They continued to perſecute
the Monks, till one of 'em, pitying them iſerable
caſe of theſe Idolaters, came on purpoſe to inform
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> of the Violence of his Officers,
and of the Obſtructions they rais'd againſt the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of the Goſpel there. Cardinal <hi>Ximenes</hi> at
that time manag'd the Affairs of <hi>Spain,</hi> who being
well inform'd of the Affairs in the <hi>Indies,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
reſolv'd to deveſt the Council there of the
Juriſdiction they pretended to have over the <hi>Indians,</hi>
as being very pernicious. But the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi>
are at ſo vaſt a diſtance from thoſe Countries, that
they have not been able ſpeedily to redreſs all the
preſſing Grievances that inceſſantly afflict thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
People. Their Laws and Orders given at
ſo great a diſtance have no great Efficacy: and 'tis
next to impoſſible for 'em to have a true account
what Perſecutions the <hi>Indians</hi> ſuffer: Or if a true
Information ſhould be had, they can only give ſome
general Orders, without deſcending to make ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
proviſion againſt all thoſe Miſchiefs that can't
be well known unleſs they were upon the place
where they are acted. Beſides, the Perſons to whom
theſe Orders are directed, commonly conceal 'em,
or defer the execution of 'em; ſo that when they go
about to fulfil 'em, 'tis too late, and the Remedies
applied prove unſeaſonable and uſeleſs. Nay, they
are often ſo wicked as to act in direct contradiction
to what is commanded 'em; and flatter themſelves
with hopes of never being call'd to account, becauſe
they are ſo remote from <hi>Spain.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>If your Majeſty would reſerve to your ſelf alone
the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Indies,</hi> without ſharing it
among the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> it would be the greateſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
imaginable to the <hi>Indians,</hi> and nothing could
more rejoice 'em, becauſe then they would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
they ſhould be no more expos'd to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57864:134"/>
and Perſecutions of their Enemies; and would
have ſo great a reſpect for your Majeſty, obey you
ſo univerſally, and love you ſo ſincerely, that they
would be always ready to ſacrifice their Lives for
your Service. You could then require nothing of
'em, but they would do it chearfully, becauſe they
ſeem to have a great propenſion to ſubmit to
your Royal Crown; whereas if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are
their abſolute Maſters, as their Obedience will
be forc'd, ſo it will be of no long continuance,
and they'l do all they can to get free of ſo ſevere
a Yoke.</p>
                              <p>Moreover, when the <hi>Indians</hi> are once perſwaded
they are under your Protection, that they may live
ſafely in their own Houſes, and need fear no injury
either in their Perſons or Goods; all that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
to the Mountains will ſoon come down to dwell
in the Plains, as they were wont heretofore. For
abundance of 'em have retreated to avoid the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties
of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and chuſe rather to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
by wild Beaſts in the Mountains, than to fall
into the hands of their Perſecutors, tho Chriſtians.
The poor Wretches ſuffer a world of Inconveniences
in thoſe places whither they have retir'd, wanting
almoſt all the Neceſſaries of Life: And 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to find 'em out to inſtruct 'em in the Chriſtian
Faith: whereas if they liv'd together in Towns and
Cities, they might eaſily be taught Religion, and a
regular ſort of Government eſtabliſh'd among 'em,
whereby they would be brought to the Service of
the True God, which would become familiar to 'em:
By this means the Ground would be cultivated, the
Roads frequented and render'd more ſafe, and the
Country no longer be deſert and forlorn: The
<hi>Spaniards</hi> would be ſupplied with Proviſions, and
convenient places to lodg in on their Journeys, and
have a thouſand other Advantages of which they
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57864:135"/>
are now depriv'd by the <hi>Indians</hi> deſerting their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations.</p>
                              <p>Your Majeſty may remember that after a mature
examination of this Affair by many learned Men
and able Divines, they unanimouſly declar'd, that
the Dominion of the <hi>Indies</hi> could not be juſtly given
to private Men, nor diſmember'd from your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Crown. This Determination was ſignified
to <hi>Ferdinando Cortez,</hi> with orders to put it in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Your Majeſty was pleas'd on the ſame account
again to call together an Aſſembly of Perſons of
great Learning and Virtue, who after a long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
declar'd that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not lawfully
be made Lords of the <hi>Indies.</hi> After which your
Majeſty gave moſt expreſs Orders to prohibit it,
revoking all Grants to the contrary procur'd on
thoſe falſe Accounts and Miſrepreſentations that
had been given you. Your Majeſty commanded the
Governor of <hi>Florida</hi> to put theſe Edicts in execution,
as may be ſtill ſeen by his Inſtructions. Among the
principal Articles of theſe Conſtitutions, one is,
That the <hi>Indians</hi> ought to be accounted free, and
not obliged to any other Services than the reſt of
your Majeſty's Subjects who enjoy their Liberty
under your Government: That they ought to
pay Tithes to God, unleſs excus'd for ſome time,
and likewiſe ſuch Tribute to your Majeſty as is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
lawfully, and in proportion to the Goods
they poſſeſs, and the quality of their Land, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the reaſonable Eſtimate of thoſe that govern
'em.</p>
                              <p>If it be deſir'd that the <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould be taught
the Catholic Faith, and brought to embrace our
Cuſtoms, while they keep up a ſort of Government
among themſelves, your Majeſty ought not to give
them as Slaves to any one whatſoever, either for
ever, or for a limited time; for this would be to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:57864:135"/>
'em to the ſame Miſeries they have hitherto
endur'd, and perhaps to increaſe them: for after
this there will be no dependence to be had on the
Orders and Prohibitions made in favour of the
<hi>Indians,</hi> whatever Penalties ſhall be annex'd to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate
their Execution; for thoſe that have bin
already made are very wiſe Edicts, and might be
very uſeful if put in practice. And one chief
Reaſon againſt giving the <hi>Indians</hi> for Vaſſals to
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> is the ſmall account theſe latter
make of the Lives of thoſe poor Creatures; for
'tis not to be imagin'd with what Contempt they
look upon 'em, unleſs by thoſe that have ſeen it:
Their exceſſive Covetouſneſs induces 'em to make
'em labor beyond their Strength, not caring what
becomes of 'em ſo they get any thing by 'em.
If any Perſons give your Majeſty a contrary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of theſe matters, you ought to look upon 'em
as Enemies to the State, and diſaffected to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Service.</p>
                              <p>If your Majeſty be convinc'd by the Arguments
produc'd, you will prevent the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
a great many Violences and Murders, of
which they are every day guilty. You will ſecure
<hi>Spain</hi> from this Contagion, in preventing your
People at home from partaking of the Sins of
their fellow-Subjects, and ſharing the Plunder with
them which they have ſo unjuſtly gotten. For all
Men of ſenſe acknowledg that the Crimes of the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America</hi> render all <hi>Spain</hi> obnoxious to
the Curſe of God; that the courſe they take to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
rich is unjuſt; that the Gold and Silver they
bring from the <hi>Indies</hi> is ſtolen, and that they are
oblig'd to reſtore it to the right Owners whom
they have unjuſtly plunder'd: which likewiſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
that thoſe that partake of theſe uſurp'd
Riches have no good Title to 'em; for they ought
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57864:136"/>
to have no Commerce with thoſe publick Robbers,
nor to ſell 'em any Commodities for their ſtolen
Gold; they ſhould not ſo much as receive Preſents
from 'em, or conſent to be their Heirs: And if ſo,
it follows that all <hi>Spain</hi> is become guilty of the
Crimes of thoſe Men; ſo that there are few but
have reaſon to be under trouble of Conſcience, and
are in danger of Damnation, becauſe there are ſcarce
any who have not participated of the Rapine of
thoſe that have come from the New World.</p>
                              <p>It has bin objected by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that if they
have not a Juriſdiction over the <hi>Indians</hi> as their
Vaſſals, it will be impoſſible for 'em to live in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
and conſequently that your Majeſty will not be
able to keep thoſe Kingdoms that have bin conquer'd
in your Name, nor to publiſh the Catholic Faith
there. For they ſay, if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> can't ſubſiſt
there, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> can't preſerve his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over the <hi>Indians,</hi> nor maintain Monks among
'em to preach to 'em, ſo that they muſt be deſtitute
of the Light of the Goſpel; and thoſe of 'em that
have already receiv'd it, will gradually loſe it for
want of freſh Inſtruction, and ſo return to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Idolatry, and other Sins.</p>
                              <p>They that reaſon after this manner, do it not ſo
much from a Principle of true Zeal and Compaſſion,
leſt ſo many Souls ſhould periſh, as from a deſire of
oppreſſing theſe People, and that they may grow
rich by the Spoil they get from 'em. 'Tis only their
privat Intereſt makes 'em talk at this rate; for they
are not at all concern'd about your Majeſty's Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
or the Salvation of the poor <hi>Indians.</hi> 'Tis not
the Good of the Public, or the Glory of God that
moves 'em; for their Conduct ſufficiently ſhews what
little reſpect they have to the Law of God, which
forbids 'em to do the leaſt hurt to any one, how
great an advantage ſoever it might procure 'em.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:57864:136"/>
They ought to know, if they have the true Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Chriſtianity, that tho your Majeſty ſhould
run the risk of loſing all your Conqueſts in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
and be render'd uncapable of cauſing the
Chriſtian Faith to be preach'd among the <hi>Indians;</hi> it
were better to forgo all ſuch great Advantages, than
to obtain 'em by ruining the Inhabitants after the
manner hitherto practis'd. It had bin no great Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to your Majeſty, if your Empire had not
extended ſo far as the <hi>Indies;</hi> and 'tis an ill way of
going to work, to endeavour to eſtabliſh Chriſtianity
there by ſuch criminal Methods. The reaſon of
which is evident, becauſe we are forbidden <hi>to do evil
that good may come,</hi> Rom. 3. 8. God is not pleas'd
with the greateſt Sacrifices if polluted with any Sin,
but abhors all ſuch Offerings. 'Tis a moſt hainous
Sin, and worthy of eternal Damnation, to maſſacre
Infidels on pretence of introducing the Chriſtian
Faith among 'em, and of extirpating a part of 'em
to ſave the reſt. God dos not require Men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his Word on ſuch hard terms, and abſolutely
forbids ſuch a kind of Zeal for the Salvation of Souls
as this. He would not have us pretend to be more
concern'd about the Salvation of Souls than himſelf.
That which he requires of us is to keep within the
compaſs of his Laws, and not to exceed the Limits
he has preſcrib'd. For 'twould be an Argument of
much Stupidity, and a great ſin for any one to throw
a Child into a Well to baptize it, and ſo to drown
it on pretence of ſaving its Soul. And is it not a
greater Crime, and more odious and abominable in
the ſight of God, to ſcandalize, deſtroy and maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre
ſo many thouſand People, under the pretext of
putting the reſt in the way of Salvation? 'Tis our
buſineſs to do all the Good we can in conforming our
ſelves to God's Commandments, and keeping with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the bounds he has ſet us, leaving the reſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57864:137"/>
But this is a falſe Gloſs which the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
uſe to cover their Avarice; for the Salvation of the
<hi>Indians</hi> is no part of their Care; all they mind is
rather to ruin and inſlave 'em, than to make Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
of 'em. Therefore in oppoſition to all their
falſe Pretences, we aſſure your Majeſty, that if you
pleaſe to reſerve to your ſelf alone the Dominion
of the <hi>Indies</hi> without admitting the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to
aſſume the quality of Lords and Maſters over the
<hi>Indians,</hi> it will be an infallible means to eſtabliſh the
Catholic Faith among them. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> will be
able to live commodiouſly among 'em in greater
numbers than they have hitherto done; and all
other Inconveniences will be remov'd, which will
mightly conduce to the Glory of God, the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the <hi>Indians,</hi> the Aggrandizement of your
Empire, and the general Good of all <hi>Spain.</hi>

                  <head>THE
ART
OF
Travelling to Advantage.</head>
                  <p>'TIS commonly thought that the Advantages
of Travelling are always out-balanc'd by
the Inconveniences that attend it; that
tho a Man is at never ſo much Charge in
his Voyages, he muſt ſtill undergo a great deal of
Hardſhip; and when all is done, the Profit he reaps is
not to be compar'd with the Fatigues he endures.
But nothing can be more falſe than this Opinion; for
in truth, the advantage of Travelling infinitely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
the trouble of it: and as the Experiment of
a Chymiſt, whatever it coſts him, is very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
when he makes ſome conſiderable diſcovery
of Nature; ſo that Traveller that knows how to
improve his Mind as he ought by his Voyages, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
well requited for the Inconveniences he has
ſuſtain'd.</p>
                  <p>The Prejudice that ſome entertain, that the want
of that Experience which is to be gain'd in Voyages
and actual Diſcoveries, may be ſupplied by reading
Books that treat of ſuch matters, or by the force of
the Imagination, which gives its own ſhape to all
things it repreſents, and never makes 'em appear as
they are in themſelves, is a mere Illuſion: For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57864:138"/>
ever foreſtals and prepoſſeſſes the Judgment is ſo
little capable of forming the Mind, that 'tis the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing which corrupts it, and deprives it of its
natural reliſh for Truth, and that diſpoſition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, which ſerves as a foundation for Reaſon to
build upon. That which is found in Books is not
always true; for beſides that Decency will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Men to write but within the compaſs of certain
Rules, Flattery, the humor of the Time and Nation
wherein a Man lives, the public Intereſt, or the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of private Affairs, always make ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between what a Man writes, and what may
be thought by thoſe among whom he lives: Which
forms an almoſt invincible Obſtacle in the way of
Truth, and hinders her from ſhewing her ſelf in her
proper ſhape.</p>
                  <p>But in Travelling we find all imaginable help and
aſſiſtance to furniſh our Minds with Experience and
Knowledg; for what is conceal'd in Books is by
this means openly diſcover'd to us; and we judg of
things with more ſafety, becauſe we ſee 'em with
greater perſpicuity when the Curtain is drawn aſide.
When we go to the very Principles of things, and
draw Water at the Fountain, the taſte and quality
of it muſt needs be moſt agreeable. This is the way
to know Men as they really are, and not only as the
Intereſt of ſome Perſons makes 'em appear to be;
and to judg of their Actions, Manners, and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
in themſelves, and not on the Credit of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Relations; ſo that the Mind receiving thence
a pure and vivid light, that ſets it above the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Prejudice, is at the ſame time confirm'd and
improv'd on ſolid grounds, and at length rais'd to
the upper Region of Policy where its great Pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena
appear.</p>
                  <p>We are taught in the Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> that to
become wiſe a Man muſt go into ſtrange Countries,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57864:138"/>
                     <hi>Sapiens in terram alienigenarum Gentium pertranſiet;</hi>
and it follows afterwards, <hi>in abſconditis ſuis concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur,</hi>
by that means he ſhall be acquainted with the
moſt profound Notions of Wiſdom, that is, of
RELIGION; <hi>Occulta Proverbiorum exquiret,</hi> he'll
make a ſcrutiny into their Maxims, Manners and
Cuſtoms, that is, into MORALITY: <hi>bona enim
&amp; mala in hominibus tentabit;</hi> he'll have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by converſing with the Living (which is much
better than to conſult the Dead) to know the ſources
of that Good and Evil which Men do either to
themſelves, or one another, that is, in one word,
POLICY. Theſe are the three fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
by which a wiſe Man ought to regulate his
Conduct, and in theſe he ought to accompliſh himſelf
by Travelling: For a Man is confirm'd in his <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
by the knowledg he acquires of the importance
and certainty of it; he forms a ſolid Scheme of
<hi>Morality</hi> from the different Practices he obſerves in
the World, and informs himſelf in the true Rules
of <hi>Policy</hi> by the uſe he finds other People make
of 'em. From which it follows, that if a Man
would be wiſe, he ought to travel; and 'tis hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be expected that any one who neglects this
method, will prove eminent for Prudence and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks.</p>
                  <p>This Art of Travelling to advantage requires
four Conditions that are all abſolutely neceſſary in
every one that would ſucceed in it. The firſt is,
That his Mind be already form'd and fix'd, and yet
this in ſuch a manner as not to be ſtrictly determin'd.
The ſecond is, That he be not prepoſſeſs'd with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices.
The third is, That his Capacity bear a
proportion to the Science or Buſineſs to which he is
devoted, and in which he deſires to be accompliſh'd.
And the fourth is, That he want no aſſiſtance
neceſſary to bring him into acquaintance with the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57864:139"/>
beſt Maſters, and that he know their Sentiments at
the firſt hand.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, the firſt Condition is to have the Mind form'd,
but not determin'd; that is, it ſhould not be ſo
crude as eagerly to receive all ſorts of Impreſſions,
and yet ſufficiently diſpos'd to give a free admiſſion
to Truth, which will perhaps be underſtood better
by an Example. One that travels too young is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
diſſatisfied in the exerciſ of the Religion
he profeſſes, by the different manners of Worſhip
he diſcovers abroad; therefore the greenneſs of his
Age makes him run a greater risk than is commonly
thought in the diſcuſſion of matters of Religion,
tho it renders him very fit to endure Fatigues, the
difference of Climats, of Food, and of the various
Seaſons of the Year. Nor is a Man any more fit to
improve by Travelling when too much advanc'd in
Years, becauſe his Mind is too much determin'd,
and in no very good diſpoſition to learn what he
thinks he knows well enough already. So that that
part of a Man's Age from twenty five to thirty five
is the moſt proper time for Travelling, becauſe his
Mind is neither wholly crude, nor entirely form'd;
that which he has already learn'd only diſpoſes him
to judg the better, while he ſeeks to be inform'd
after another manner; and thus he makes ſo fair a
deciſion of what he learns, that all the Sophiſms in
the World will never ſhake him. By this 'tis eaſy
to ſee whence it is that ſo few are the better for
Travelling, and can only give an account of ſuch
Circumſtances as Soldiers and Poſtilions might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
relate; 'tis to be attributed either to their too
great Youth or too great Age.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Qualification of a Traveller is, That
he be void of Prejudice in every thing, about which
he deſires to receive Information; becauſe Prejudice
produces ſuch an Effect upon our Reaſon, as a Film
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57864:139"/>
does upon the Eye; it caſts ſuch a Miſt upon it, and
renders it ſo uncapable to make a fair Judgment of
what is propos'd to it, that nothing can be more
oppoſite to the diſcovery of Truth than Prepoſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which if it bear ſway in the Mind, will give little
hope of improvement by Travelling.</p>
                  <p>The third Quality requiſite is, To have a Capacity
of Mind proportionate to the buſineſs to which a man
applies himſelf, and in which he ſeeks to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd:
For ſeeing the Rudiments of Painting and
other Arts are not to be learn'd by Travelling, and
obſerving the fineſt Strokes of the beſt Maſters;
but a Man muſt be cut out for a buſineſs before he
preſumes to ſeek Improvement in it by going abroad:
They that ſuppoſe to turn a Blockhead into a Man of
Parts by ſending him into foreign Countries, will
find themſelves miſtaken. He that has but a ſmall
Natural Capacity will never have a large one, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
courſe be taken to improve it: 'Tis true, he may
learn by Travelling to fill up what Capacity he has,
but he'll never be able to go beyond it; for the
Minds of Men have their ſeveral degrees of height
and ſtrength, as well as their Bodies; and as 'tis
impoſſible by all the Art in the World to add one
inch to a Man's Stature when at his full growth, ſo
'tis utterly impracticable to enlarge the Capacity
of his Mind beyond the Bounds which Nature has
preſcrib'd.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Qualification is, To be furniſh'd with
all neceſſary Aſſiſtance to facilitate his Acceſs to the
Maſters of thoſe Arts and Sciences he has a mind to
learn; in which reſpect every Country has a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Genius; ſo that 'tis often ſeen, that what may
contribute to a man's aſſiſtance in one place, will by
no means do him any good in another. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
In <hi>Germany</hi> a man ſhall never get inward
with Great Men by being profuſe in his Expences,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57864:140"/>
but will by this means be the more likely to fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſuſpicion, and become much leſs welcome than
one of another Character. To gain Eſteem there,
a Man muſt bring with him a good Reputation, a
diſtiguiſh'd Birth, or an extraordinary Merit. In
<hi>Italy</hi> the quite contrary Humor obtains. And in the
<hi>Levant</hi> neither one nor t'other takes place, but an
Air of Simplicity, Sincerity and Honeſty will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
a Man into any Company. An eloquent
and voluble Tongue does well in <hi>Poland,</hi> but very
ill in <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſtill worſe at <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> A great
ſhew of Devotion will naturalize a Man in <hi>Portugal,</hi>
but render him ridiculous in the Northern King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.
A pleaſant and merry Humor will ſpoil a
Man's buſineſs in <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> but give him eaſy
acceſs in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the knowledg of Tongues, beſides that it
is impoſſible to acquire all a Man wants if he travel
any thing far, and that it will not do him all the
Service that is commonly imagin'd, if he has only a
mind to run through <hi>Europe,</hi> it is a great occaſion of
the Corruption of Manners, by eaſily introducing
Men into places of Debauchery; and on the other
hand it has been obſerv'd, that it contributes very
little to the forming of the Mind: for beſides that
it is not the common People that a Man ought to be
curious in conſulting; and among Men of figure the
knowledg of their Language renders a Man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to ſuſpicion, 'tis ſufficient that a Man can
ſpeak any one Language that is know: As the
Italian Tongue is very common in <hi>Greece</hi> and the
Leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> beſides the help one may have from
Interpreters, of whom there are great numbers for
all the living Tongues in <hi>Europe.</hi> And if you ſpeak
a dead Language with any Native of a foreign
Country, he has no advantage above you; and if
you are better vers'd in it than he, he'll be ſure to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57864:140"/>
ſupply what he wants in Expreſſion by the degree
of Knowledg, wherein he excels you in reſpect of
the matter about which you converſe, and will give
you a greater inſight into it in half an hour's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
than you ſhould have obtain'd it may be in
twenty Viſits, if you had made uſe of his Native
Language. 'Tis ſufficient if you have Language
enough to make your ſelf underſtood about your
neceſſary Affairs; and there are always People to
be found, who will make uſe of your Native Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
to diſcourſe with you ſo as not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by others, that they may learn ſomething of
you that others don't know; and that they may
give you occaſion to learn ſomething of them which
you don't yet underſtand. But Curioſity ought to be
kept within the bounds of Patience and Diſcretion,
and that being ſuppos'd, there's ſcarce any thing
but a Man may be capable of it in Travelling; if
one can but add to the Conditions I have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
a lively and yet obſequious Fancy, and eaſy
and faithful Memory, a ſweet and inſinuating Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
a Curioſity that is not impatient, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
way of judging. Theſe are the Qualities that
give a Man an eaſy and agreeable reception into all
Companies, and prepoſſeſs the People of any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with favourable thoughts of a Traveller who is
endow'd with 'em. Theſe cut his Work ſhort, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
all Obſtacles in the way of his acquaintance
with them, and bring them into ſuch a familiarity
with him, as will be ſure to engage their Confidence,
if he be but careful to obſerve himſelf, as well as
ſtudy the Temper of others. Theſe are the Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Policy, which by diſcovering the Humor,
Inclinations and Genius of every Nation, inſenſibly
bring us to the knowledg of their Maxims, their
Reaſons of State, their Deſigns, their Conduct and
various Sentiments. In a word, 'tis by the help of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57864:141"/>
theſe Qualifications, that a Man becomes a <hi>Proteus</hi>
in foreign Countries, and knows how to transform
himſelf into the ſhape of others, and ſo to conceal
his own. And by conſequence muſt needs reap ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
by all the good he ſees or hears, which is
agreeable to his Character, and the Capacity of his
Mind.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, he ſhould have a lively, but obſequious Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
which may paſs for a Paradox among ſuch
as judg haſtily, juſt as they feel their Fancies touch'd;
and ſuppoſing a lively Imagination can never be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequious
without loſing its Vivacity at the ſame time,
will tell me I require an impoſſibility: 'tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
convenient to undeceive 'em by a ſenſible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon.
When one that ſeeks for Game ſees ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
move in a Buſh, his firſt motion is to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in a poſture to ſhoot; but if he diſcharges im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
without any further Obſervation, he may
well be counted raſh, and his precipitancy will ſpoil
his Deſign: whereas if he has prudence and patience,
he'll obſerve what 'tis that ſtirs, and endeavour to
diſcover what Game may be in the Buſh, which way
it came, and whither it goes, which gives him the
greater advantage to direct his Aim, ſo that his ſhot
can hardly miſs. There's no Compariſon can be
more juſt and applicable to the caſe in hand. A
Traveller that has a mind to make ſome Diſcoveries
in the Myſteries of State-Policy, is prying and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
with an Activity like that of one who is
ſeeking after Game; every thing that appears more
than ordinary ought to ſtrike his Mind ſo as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
his Attention: but nothing ought to determine
him but his Reaſon, and a due application of the
Principles of Policy; he ſhould ſee and hear, and
take a meaſure of every thing, without imagining
he has got any thing till he has meaſur'd it with
that profound Diſcuſſion I have been commending.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57864:141"/>
Stateſmen are extremely crafty, and know how to
dodg with a Stranger, eſpecially when they ſee in
him a great Vivacity and Eagerneſs to receive what
they tell him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Artifices are us'd in all Nations more or
leſs according to the degree of their Refinement and
Subtilty: Therefore the intelligent Traveller muſt
imitate the cunning Hunter, who ſometimes makes
as if he did not ſee his Game, merely to ſurprize
it the more eaſily: He muſt make as if he did not
hear ſome things, and as if he underſtood much leſs,
and diſcover'd nothing at all; from whence one of
theſe two things muſt neceſſarily follow, either that
he will be ſuppos'd to be ignorant and ſtupid, which
will render him leſs ſuſpected, and occaſion a new
Explication of the matter diſcourſed of in more
open and intelligible terms; or elſe that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
he converſes with, will immediately give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
turn to the Subject in hand by different Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
and the variety of Terms cannot chooſe
but give ſome light into what he would conceal or
diſguiſe.</p>
                  <p>He may alſo learn ſomewhat from the common
report of a Province or City, to inform him what is
the predominant Genius of a Nation, or of the Court
that governs it, only with this difference, that what
he is told of the Spirit of any Nation, is generally
and almoſt infallibly true; whereas the Idea that is
given of a Court is almoſt always falſe; ſo that
'twould be a kind of Miracle if ever it ſhould
happen to be true. There is in the Voice of the
Publick a certain tract of Truth, Simplicity, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
and Sincerity, which keeps the Multitude
either from being eaſily deceiv'd themſelves, or
from deceiving others; and ſo much the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
(as <hi>Origen</hi> ſays) God, the firſt Cauſe of all
things, has reſerv'd only this way to make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57864:142"/>
of Truth on the Minds of the Populace, who
are not capable of any other diſcuſſion of things,
much leſs of refin'd Politicks; which gave occaſion
to that wiſe ſaying, <hi>The Voice of the People is the
Voice of God.</hi> But the Court is another World,
where all things are compounded, and from whence
Simplicity, Candor, Sincerity, and oftentimes even
Juſtice and Truth are exil'd. And ſeeing the Men
of this World are different from others, 'tis not to
be wonder'd at if one is deceiv'd by their Diſguiſes,
and if the warm Fancy of a young Man is every
day impos'd on by them: For every thing they do
is with deſign, and therefore 'tis no wonder that
there's double dealing in all Affairs, ſo that one
knows not where to have 'em. Hence it is that
thoſe Authors that write Relations of the State of
Princes-Courts, are carried away with ſo many
Illuſions: For the more account they make of that
certain knowledg they pretend to have of 'em, and
the more the Miniſtry ſee they depend upon it, the
more they vary in their diſcourſe with ſuch an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
to deprive him of the ſight of what he aims
at, by embaraſſing his Mind with diverſity of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums.</p>
                  <p>There's no Rock more dangerous to an intelligent
Traveller, than the popular Reports which a Prince's
Council either purpoſely ſpreads abroad, or ſuffers
to be divulg'd: There's no ſtreſs to be laid on ſuch
Stories, and a Man ought to be careful not to ſuffer
himſelf to be ſurpriz'd by 'em. A wiſe Roman on
ſuch an occaſion one day ſaid to me, <hi>Se queſto foſſe
véro, non to ſaprébbe il popolo.</hi> 
                     <q>The Credit the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
give this Report may be enough to convince
you that there's no ſuch matter at the Palace, but
that the buſineſs is either already finiſh'd, or elſe
'tis a ſtroke that is not reſolv'd, and it may be
not thought on, for if it was either the one or the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57864:142"/>
other, you may be ſure the People would have
known nothing of it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>However 'tis true, that common Reports as they
precaution the Fancy inſtead of inſtructing it, do
not fail to furniſh a Traveller with ſuch Notices, as
muſt needs turn to his account. Theſe Reports
<hi>Saluſt</hi> very wiſely calls, <hi>Experimenta Nationum, The
Trials of the People;</hi> for there is at leaſt ſo much
probability in 'em, that they have ſome Principle
that gives riſe to 'em, and that they have given
ſome colour to an End which a Court is willing to
hide by ſome ſpecious means.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs the <hi>Italians</hi> excel all Chriſtian Nations
in this method of Travelling; but the People of
the Eaſt infinitely out-do the <hi>Italians</hi> themſelves:
and 'tis from the long Converſation I have had with
both, that I have receiv'd what Light I have in this
matter, eſpecially the way of abating the heat of
Fancy, and preventing it from being tranſported
beyond due bounds by its Vivacity, in which the
Eaſtern People are inimitable; and 'tis a Quality
one can't behold in 'em without Aſtoniſhment.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing a Fancy that is tractable and obedient
determines nothing, and what it diſcovers may as
well deceive it as inform it; it ought to commit the
diſcuſſion of all to the Judgment that ſo it may come
to a reſult: For this purpoſe the Judgment ought to
be ſublime and clear, tho theſe two Qualities are
not ſo compatible as at the firſt glance they ſeem to
be: for the elevation of the Mind expoſes it to
Miſts and Clouds, tho clearneſs of thought is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to an extenſive Soul. The former is like the
tops of Mountains which reach to the Clouds, and
almoſt always ſeem cover'd with a Miſt to them
that ſtand in the Plain. That is, to explain the
Similitude; That Genius which is naturally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime,
being leſs capable than others of ſtooping
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57864:143"/>
down to the many frivolous Circumſtances which
concur to the diſcovery of the politick Spirit of a
Court, often happens to paſs ſuch a Judgment as is
not free from all Objections, or elſe his way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
is leſs clear and intelligible than that of
others. On the contrary, they that affect clearneſs
of Judgment creep on the ground as it were, ſtill
following the natural extent of their Minds which
ſerves for a Line to direct their ſteps; and as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this they could never go directly to the end they
have in view, ſo by the help of it they do every
thing with a becoming Juſtneſs and Deliberation.</p>
                  <p>Happy are they whoſe Genius is both ſublime and
extenſive, for the elevation of their Minds ſhews
'em what Souls of an inferior Rank could never
have diſcover'd; and their extenſion ſerves to help
to render every thing preſent to 'em without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
becauſe the elevation of their Minds gives
'em a proſpect of every thing; ſo that they ſee both
diſtinctly, and as it were at one view, whatever
is neceſſary to direct 'em to make a right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>To inculcate this matter the better, it may not
be amiſs to make uſe of a Compariſon. Suppoſe
three Men walking in the field together diſcover an
Object at a diſtance: one of 'em having obſerv'd
it, ſays 'tis a Cart going on the top of a Hill; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuppoſes it to be a Buſh wav'd up and down by
the Wind; and the third is confident 'tis a Man on
horſeback riding againſt the Wind. Now it being
naturally impoſſible for the ſame Object to be at
once a Cart, a Buſh, and a Man on horſeback, 'tis
moſt certain that at leaſt two of the three are
miſtaken in their Judgments; and if one of them
judges right, it muſt be he that conſiders with the
greateſt force of thought all poſſible Motions of that
Object about which he has thought fit to make a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57864:143"/>
Judgment. This diſcovery is not to be aſcrib'd
preciſely to the ſenſe of ſeeing, ſince this is ſuppos'd
to be alike in all three; therefore the truth of this
Judgment muſt be attributed to the quality of his
Mind who has the beſt notices of the matter.</p>
                  <p>The application of this Compariſon is eaſy: Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
often think they have diſcover'd every thing
that paſſes in a Court, thoſe Enterprizes that are yet
only to be ſeen at a diſtance, and thoſe Deſigns that
are ſtill more remote; yet 'tis not poſſible that all
that make theſe Obſervations ſhould have the ſame
elevation of Mind, and none but ſuch as have a very
ſublime and clear Judgment are capable of ſpeaking
accuratly of what they have obſerv'd. Hence it is
that we ſee ſo many different accounts of foreign
Countries, and yet all of 'em publiſh'd for truth by
their reſpective Authors; and indeed they may be
ſo, but this in proportion to the Character of the
Minds of thoſe who compos'd 'em in their Travels,
according to the Judgment they made of things.</p>
                  <p>If I had not read in the account of the Voyage to
<hi>Athens</hi> the Hiſtory of one <hi>Hieros Damaskinos</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyero,</hi>
with whom I had juſt ſuch another interview
as the Author of that Relation ſays happen'd to
him, I would here give an account of it at large;
but ſhall now only add ſomething which that Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
ſeems not to have met withal. There were
three Gentlemen of different Countries and my ſelf
one day diſcourſing with this illuſtrious <hi>Caloyer</hi> about
the Policy of the <hi>Turks,</hi> which each of us pretended
to look upon as barbarous and uncultivated, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to give him an occaſion to ſpeak of it after ſuch
a manner as might give us light into it. He told
us he had no skill in Policy either in general, or in
the uſe of it among the <hi>Turks;</hi> and that he made it
his buſineſs only to underſtand and explain the holy
Scripture to his Diſciples of <hi>Athens:</hi> but he ſaid if
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57864:144"/>
we would addreſs our ſelves to the <hi>Turks,</hi> as to the
<hi>Vaivode</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> or any other Perſon of Note,
they would be ſure to give us ſatisfaction in thoſe
matters.</p>
                  <p>I remember I was the only Perſon in the company
that could not be perſwaded that this <hi>Caloyer</hi> was
unacquainted with Politicks. A very ingenious <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>
thought he was too much devoted to the ſtudy
of the Scripture to have any great matter of skill
in other things. A <hi>German</hi> that was of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
took him for a Perſon only vers'd in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the School-men, and capable of criticizing
on the holy Scripture: an <hi>Italian</hi> that was with us
maintain'd that as he was one of that remnant of
Greeks who ſeem to be the Poſterity of the Peaſants
of former times; he had not ſubtilty of mind
enough to penetrate into ſuch Politicks as were as
burdenſom to 'em as they appear'd violent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable.</p>
                  <p>We puſh'd our Curioſity yet further, and by good
luck a <hi>Sangiac</hi> who was upon his return from <hi>Candie</hi>
to the Port, and paſs'd through <hi>Athens,</hi> was ſo kind
as to inform us of many things we had a mind to
know; and among other things told us there was no
Man in the World knew more of thoſe matters
than this Grecian. It may eaſily be imagin'd I hug'd
my ſelf for judging differently of this Man from the
reſt of the company. And at laſt, after many earneſt
Sollicitations, we engag'd this learned <hi>Caloyer</hi> to take
off the Mask, and ſhew us that he was under ſuch a
ſerious diſguiſe of Simplicity as would have deceiv'd
a thouſand People.</p>
                  <p>To return from this Digreſſion; I ſay, to judg
well of all that preſents and ſtrikes the Imagination
of a man in travelling into foreign Parts, whether
it concern Religion, Morals or Politicks, there's
need of both elevation and clearneſs in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57864:144"/>
that is to ſay, ſuch a meaſure of both, as
may diſpoſe things in ſo much order that they don't
perplex and confound the Minds of other Men, nor
produce any thing in 'em but Light. And this
Qualification is not to be acquir'd if a Man is not
born with a ſutable diſpoſition. It can't be well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
but by Practice; however, to give ſome Idea
of it, it ſeems to me to conſiſt in three things:
Firſt, In laying the ſtreſs of one's Judgment on that
which makes the leaſt appearance in an Intrigue or
Negotiation; for Policy being the Academy of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe,
and an exerciſe of Craft and Subtilty, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
that which appears leaſt in a politick Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
may paſs for the moſt real and true part of
it. Secondly, In never counting any thing ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
explain'd to determine one's mind about it,
that ſo the unexpected ſounding of ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
or other, that does not ſeem to be thought
of, may give one a diſcovery of ſomewhat of which
the Miniſtry of a Court perhaps is not aware. And
ſo much the more in as much as ſpeculative Policy
being ſuppos'd impenetrable, and not beginning to
appear till 'tis going to be put in execution, 'tis in
the Circumſtances of the Execution that you are
to ſeek the certain diſcovery of the Deſign. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
In the oppoſition of one thing to another; for
altho the means employ'd in any particular politick
Deſign may be abſolutely alter'd from one day to
another, becauſe there's no Medium always eſſential
to and inſeparable from Policy, yet 'tis certain, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
how Men are made, that 'tis probable the
Council of a Prince don't alter their common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
nor take up Reſolutions as contradictory one
to another as Black to White: and therefore the
Oppoſition an intelligent Traveller diſcovers in the
Affairs on which he is making obſervation, ought to
ſuſpend his Judgment, and to oblige him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57864:145"/>
determining his Opinion, till time give him
further light. The firſt of theſe Rules forms the
Judgment, and renders it ſolid; the ſecond culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates
and refines it; and the third advances it to
Perfection. The firſt is owing more to Nature than
Experience; the ſecond depends as much on Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
as on a Genius: and the third raiſes the
Mind to a conſummate Prudence, which is the higheſt
pitch of politick Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>That Traveller who has not an elevation of Mind
capable of ſuch Inventions as may out-wit another,
may make uſe of the ſecond Character of a prudent
Mind, namely, to enquire much into things, and
determine but little about 'em; but if a Man wants
both the one and the other of theſe Qualities, we'll
venture to propheſy that he'll never become a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician.</p>
                  <p>The Memory in the judgment of many paſſes for
one of the moſt excellent Faculties of the Soul:
But few conſider, that ſeeing it brings out nothing
but what has been committed to it before, when
there is Confuſion in the Mind, there muſt alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
be the like diſorder in the Memory. 'Tis
a great advantage to a Traveller to have a Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
eaſily impreſſible, provided it be faithful; for if
a Man becauſe he has ſeen much, goes about to utter
a great deal without giving an intelligible account of
matters, by reaſon of that Confuſion which the ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
diverſity of Things, Names and Circumſtances
ordinarily occaſions, his Memory appears to be a
mere Labyrinth of Perplexity.</p>
                  <p>I have always look'd upon an eaſy Memory to be
like a handſome Face, which hides a great many
Infirmities in a crazy Body, and ſtrikes the Fancy
more than all theſe Imperfections, tho they really
much out-balance it. For beſides that ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
ſerves for a Rock for the Imagination to ſplit
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57864:145"/>
on, and this becomes as dangerous to the Reaſon
and Judgment, ſuppoſing it not to be incompatible
with the regular exerciſe of either of theſe; yet
'tis moſt certain a great multiplicity of Facts require
either abundance of time to range 'em in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
or a prodigious heat of Fancy to melt 'em
down (as it were) altogether, without making any
alteration in 'em. So that it ſeems an impoſſible
ſuppoſition, that an eaſy Memory can be ſtrong and
true, ſo as not to divert from that ſteady Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which the Judgment requires.</p>
                  <p>And yet both are neceſſary for a Traveller, ſo
that one of theſe Qualities without the other would
be of no uſe to get the knowledg of the State-Reſolutions
of any foreign Politicians: For if what
he learns to day is not ſupported with all thoſe
Circumſtances that may render it more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
to his diſcuſſion, and is not produc'd afreſh in
all its Circumſtances when any Affair that bears a
proportion to it preſents, 'tis eaſy to conceive that
all the Circumſtances that help'd him at firſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
the matter in hand being repreſented to him but
by halves, and in the room of thoſe that are omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
others ſubſtituted which alter the ſtate of the
caſe; 'tis not difficult, I ſay, to conceive that ſuch
an eaſy Memory muſt caſt him into confuſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it does not faithfully revive all thoſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.
This Concluſion may be ſet in a clearer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
by an Example.</p>
                  <p>The Viſier <hi>Kara Muſtapha</hi> who beſieg'd <hi>Vienna</hi>
remember'd the Advice, and a great many of the
Projects Count <hi>Tekely</hi> had given him in his Tent at
their enterview beyond <hi>Buda</hi> before this great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize:
And his Memory reproduc'd that in his
extremity, which his Pride had made him deſpiſe.
The Count perſwaded him to poſſeſs himſelf of the
Bridges of <hi>Vienna</hi> on the North-ſide before he made
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57864:146"/>
a formal Siege, preſuming that by this means he
would either block up the late Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>
with his Troops in <hi>Leopalſtat,</hi> or oblige him to quit
it with the more ſpeed, and a greater number of his
Men, which would make the Circumvallation more
eaſy, and the Gariſon probably leſs numerous, or
elſe the Duke would expoſe himſelf to be firſt routed
in the field<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and never was any Advice more wiſely
given, or more raſhly contemn'd.</p>
                  <p>When this Viſier was mortified by the Reſiſtance
of the Beſieged, and reſolv'd to attempt any thing
to repair the damage he had ſuſtain'd, and the time
he had loſt in this Siege, he was willing to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to Count <hi>Tekely</hi>'s Counſel, and would needs
endeavour to be maſter of thoſe Bridges, without
conſidering the difference of Time and other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances;
he gave his Orders for the execution
of this Deſign, but inſtead of depriving <hi>Vienna</hi> of
good part of its Gariſon, or of weakening thoſe
Succors which the Prince of <hi>Lorrain</hi> manag'd ſo
long, and to ſo good purpoſe againſt him, as he
might certainly have done in the former Juncture,
he diminiſh'd his own Force, and ſent his Troops to
be cut in pieces without being able to execute the
Orders they had receiv'd.</p>
                  <p>By this one may judg that an eaſy Memory is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
dangerous when 'tis unfaithful; tho I confeſs
'tis leſs ſo in the ſpeculation of a Traveller than in
the conduct of a Stateſman, who ought from the
very firſt ſtep he takes to diſtruſt it more than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on it. Memory is a great help at the Bar, and
in the Pulpit, but 'tis the leaſt Qualification of a
Stateſman. 'Tis by reading (which is a kind of
Travelling) and by Travelling (which is a living
ſort of reading) that a Man is to be convinc'd of
this Truth, that an eaſy Memory being uſually
treacherous when 'tis over-charg'd with many things
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57864:146"/>
that have no mutual connexion, nothing is to be
omitted that may render it leſs eaſy and more
faithful.</p>
                  <p>I think I have obſerv'd by Experience three Rules
that contribute much to reduce the Memory to this
ſtate, which is certainly no eaſy matter to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh.
The firſt is, for a Man to learn well the chief
foreign things about which he has a mind to employ
his Memory, without troubling himſelf to retain the
proper Names of Places, Perſons and Times, of
which Gazetteers ſeldom fail to give a very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
account for the information of the Curious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis their province to know things of this
kind. The ſecond is, To join that which one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to know, to what one knows already by ſome
<hi>Epocha</hi> of Facts, Times, or Conjunctures, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
and refer one to another; as, for inſtance,
to join to the raiſing the Siege of <hi>Vienna</hi> the politick
Propoſition made by the King of <hi>Poland</hi> for his
eldeſt Son to be married to the Archdutcheſs as his
Reward for relieving that City. The third is, to
unite and accommodate both the one and the other
to the Circumſtances and actual Conduct of the
Country where a Man is at preſent, or whither he
is to return; becauſe what paſſes there can't eaſily
eſcape the Mind, being often reviv'd by the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and therefore that which has been link'd to it
will alſo be retain'd, and the Memory render'd faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to ſuch a degree, that all things will be eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected.</p>
                  <p>I ſay a Man ought in the firſt place thorowly to
poſſeſs his Mind with the firſt diſcoveries he makes
in his Travels; that is to ſay, after he has made a
deep ſearch into the Precepts of Policy (without
which nothing is to be expected of him) to look on
every ſide upon that which firſt ſtrikes his Mind in a
manner different from the Prejudices he has brought
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57864:147"/>
out of his own Country, that ſo he may object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his own Prepoſſeſſion all thoſe Reaſons that
he imputes to the Prejudices of others, which is fit
to be demonſtrated by an Example.</p>
                  <p>A French Man that goes to <hi>Rome</hi> furniſh'd with
many Advantages and Recommendations that give
him acceſs to Perſons of Quality, is preſently loaded
with Civilities, without being taken into that kind
of Familiarity with them, which is ſo agreeable to
his Humor: This makes him impatient, and it ſeems
no ſmall Puniſhment to him to continue ſix weeks
at <hi>Rome,</hi> to live all the while in an Inn: But at
length the Reaſons of this kind of Treatment are
open'd to him, and he comes to underſtand that the
<hi>Italian</hi> loving Splendor tho he is not rich, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
to be liberal without incommoding himſelf,
waits to regale him after a magnificent manner and
in good company, when he finds a proper time for
it, and then his Splendor, Profuſion and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
will appear at once. He muſt therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
all the Reaſons of this kind of Conduct; and
by oppoſing this liberty the <hi>Italians</hi> reſerve to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
to the ordinary profuſeneſs of that Nation,
he'll be convinc'd that they do well at <hi>Rome</hi> not to
live in that familiarity he ſo much deſir'd. Theſe
Diſcoveries will be ſerviceable to him at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
and he'll appear a knowing Man in other places
in proportion to the faithfulneſs of his Memory in
reviving the Reaſons, and different reſpects that
have determin'd him at <hi>Rome.</hi> This is what I call
a thorow poſſeſſing of the Mind with that which
one deſires to commit to Memory.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond method is, to join things together by
ſome <hi>Epocha</hi> that is remarkable, and not eaſy to be
chang'd. This Connexion is like a Guide always
going before the Judgment with a light in his hand,
ſo that he ſeldom miſtakes his way who is conducted
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57864:147"/>
by it. The <hi>Epocha</hi> contributes much to the fidelity
of the Memory, and the things being allied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by a proper reference and proportion, 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
impoſſible that the revival of 'em in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
ſhould not be exact and true.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon of which is not from the nature of
thoſe Incidents which accidentally happen to be
link'd together, but from the immediate applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Mind, which becauſe it omits nothing
that may give it a deep impreſſion of a thing, can't
ſee two different Circumſtances which concur to the
ſame Fact, without making a certain fix'd Point, as
well for the Time, as other Conjunctures: 'Tis this
that has occaſion'd ſo many Digreſſions in antient
Hiſtorians, who have not been able to reſiſt that
natural Inclination of ſhewing in the ſame Treatiſe,
what they had obſerv'd at the ſame time, and by
the ſame diſcoveries.</p>
                  <p>In fine, the third method of rendering the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
faithful is, to reunite the Notices one receives,
and the Conjunctures that preſent, to what actually
paſſes in one's own Country; becauſe the revival
of what is acted there muſt needs be frequent and
of long duration, and a Man's mind will neceſſarily
be concern'd about it; and ſeeing this obliges a
Man to join to his preſent Obſervations, that which
paſs'd in his own Country when he was there, he
is as it were tied faſt to the Circumſtances of things
ſo that he cannot eaſily miſtake 'em, but is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
oblig'd to revive 'em in his mind. 'Tis true,
there muſt be ſtrength of Thought, Labor and Time
to reunite theſe things after long Voyages, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if our Traveller has not had much correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with his own Country: But Experience every
day ſhews that 'tis no impoſſible thing.</p>
                  <p>This is, in my opinion, the innocent Art of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
an eaſy Memory faithful; let us now paſs
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57864:148"/>
to the other Qualifications of a Traveller.</p>
                  <p>It has been ſaid that he ought to have a ſweet and
inſinuating Humor, not by a ſtudy'd compoſing of
himſelf, which will ſoon betray him when he tarries
long in a place, but by a docility of Mind, which
makes a Man as it were naturally comply with things
that one would think muſt needs ſhock him, to judg
of him by the guſt of his Country. 'Tis this
ſweetneſs of temper which becomes Affability in
thoſe who are in public Poſts, but in Travellers it
ſhould always be Condeſcenſion, without degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
into a ſervile weakneſs of Mind: And they
ought to have the art of uſing this Condeſcenſion
after an advantageous manner, ſo as to engage thoſe
with whom they converſe, either to confide in 'em,
or to inform 'em. Suppoſe, for inſtance, that one
happens to be with an Engliſh-man who boaſts of
his own Nation, in reſpect of its Strength, Courage,
Trade, Plenty and Independence; and ſcarce ever
ſpeaks of a French-man, an Italian, or a German,
without contempt; a Traveller who has docility,
and yet firmness of Mind, will in ſincere terms give
his Suffrage to applaud what is good in the Engliſh
Nation, and in their Polities, without undertaking
to make compariſons between Nation and Nation,
or ſo much as between Man and Man, which ought
to be induſtriouſly avoided; becauſe there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in foreign Countries ſome Perſons that go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a diſguiſe, whoſe Genius, Country, Intereſt and
Deſigns, can ſcarce ever be diſcover'd, but yet by
this means may be won upon. In obſerving this
Conduct, our Traveller would not fail to attract the
Confidence of ſuch an Engliſh-man, and ſo might
get out of him why the Engliſh Nation is ſo fickle
and unſteady in the midſt of all its Proſperity, why
they are ſo eager after Gain amidſt ſo great Riches,
and why they are ſo unfit for long Enterprizes and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57864:148"/>
tedious Conqueſts, tho they have ſuch good Armies
and Fleets. In a word, he'd learn more of this
Engliſh-man in three days, than he could perhaps
in reading all the Hiſtorians that have written of
that Country.</p>
                  <p>But to give the Demonſtration of this, when ever
any thing flatters and pleaſes a Man to ſuch a degree
as to make him deſpiſe what does not ſeem to bear a
proportion to it, either he is a Fool, or under a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe,
or an intelligent Man ſet upon his own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
and over-zealous for it. If the firſt, a wiſe
Traveller will eaſily diſcover him, and contemn
him, without troubling himſelf to talk with him.
If the ſecond, he'll make trial of him by the Rules
I have been laying down; ſo that this Man under a
Mask ſhall not be able to proceed far without being
either reduc'd to ſilence, or elſe betraying himſelf.
If the laſt, he can't be a man of Knowledg but by
the univerſal Principles of Policy, in which he has
no advantage above our Traveller, or elſe by ſuch
particular Deciſions he has made as are proper to
his Country; and in this point he excites all the
Curioſity of our Traveller, who for his own ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
muſt apply himſelf to receive Inſtruction
with all that nice Complaiſance which we have been
already ſuppoſing; he muſt hearken, applaud, and
enquire: for Attention and Applauſe always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Eſteem and Confidence of him that ſpeaks;
and a ſweet, ingenuous and modeſt way of inquiring
always returns with ſome diſcoveries; Experience
ſhews that it never fails to get ſome degrees of
knowledg out of thoſe upon whom 'tis duly tried.
The Information I have receiv'd even from a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
as it were by accident, of a Viſit made by a
certain Perſon to his Maſter, has furniſh'd me
with the firſt occaſion of diving into an Affair, of
which I had not the leaſt thought, and the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57864:149"/>
very of which gave me that ſatisfaction which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to one that travels for his Information.</p>
                  <p>But to re<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap> this Effect the more certain; to this
quality one ought to add a Curioſity that is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient.
Curioſity is needful in travelling, but then
it ought not to be too brisk and lively, that one
may the better diſſemble the Motives of it, and
cover 'em with the uſual pretexts of ſuch a vain
Curioſity as only applies it ſelf to the deſcription
of Churches, Palaces, Gardens, Fortifications, and
the detail of ſuch Counſels and Circumſtances as
the meaneſt Servants of a Court always underſtand,
as well as thoſe that compoſe Hiſtorical Relations.
There muſt be Curioſity to mitigate the uneaſineſs
and difficulty a man muſt be ſure to meet with in
accommodating one's way of Living, Habit and
Manners, to the Cuſtom of Countries ſo unlike one's
own: for ſeeing Self-love hath more preſſing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
when it deprives it ſelf of what is pleaſing to it,
to expoſe it ſelf to that to which it has an averſion;
'tis neceſſary that it be requited for quitting what it
ſo naturally likes, by ſome other ſatisfaction which
the Fancy has the art to repreſent as greater, more
rare, and more durable; without which there's no
probable ground to expect a Man ſhould travel with
delight, and 'twould be an unadviſed thing to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it. For to ſuppoſe that all thoſe advantages
a Man may make uſe of in Travelling will excuſe
him from all kind of uneaſineſs, is to pleaſe one's
ſelf with a mere Deluſion, eſpecially when a Man
goes out of the Chriſtian part of <hi>Europe.</hi> Curioſity
therefore muſt ſerve inſtead of all other Pleaſure to
make amends for the Expence and Uneaſineſs to
which our Traveller is expos'd.</p>
                  <p>This Curioſity deprives it ſelf of what it deſigns
to obtain, when it once appears to be impatient,
and it really is impatient when ever it appears to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57864:149"/>
be ſo. Men of all Countries in the World are
fram'd after ſuch a manner, that no Man is willing
to oblige another to his own diſadvantage; and the
moſt grateful and officious Perſon that can be will
never give an occaſion of getting an advantage over
him by what he diſcovers. All that obſerve a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
have in this reſpect the ſame impreſſion; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
body ſuſpects that Man to have ſome ſpecial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
who leaves his Family and his Country to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
himſelf to Sickneſs and other Dangers and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
which are inevitable. They that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
he has only a ſenſual Curioſity are always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
enough to ſatisfy him in that reſpect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſelf-love obliges a Man to diſcover whatever
is curious in his own Country to a Stranger: but it
being another ſort of Traveller that I have been
ſuppoſing, namely, one who ſeeks to get an inſight
into State-Policy; the chief Advice I would give
him, is not to deveſt himſelf of Curioſity (for that
would be unreaſonable) but not to be impatient in
ſeeking to give it ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Impatience is the daughter of Deſire, and this
if it be reaſonable, muſt be the production of the
Judgment, which will fully convince a Man that
whatever ſets him at a greater diſtance from the
end he has in view, can't be proper to lead him to
it. Now Impatience will infallibly ſet our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
at a greater diſtance from the End he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
and conſequently cannot be fit to promote
the Pleaſure he expects from it. But to make it
the better underſtood how and why Impatience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards
the ſatisfaction of the Curioſity, one need on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerve that it produces ſuch precaution in the
Minds of thoſe with whom a Traveller converſes,
as becomes a kind of Partition-wall, that he muſt
either pierce through or break down before he can
diſcover what is acted on the other ſide of it. The
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57864:150"/>
more importunate a Man of underſtanding perceives
a Stranger to be to get information, the leſs willing
he is to ſatisfy him, and keeps the greater guard
on himſelf not to gratify his deſire till he is as it
were neceſſitated to do it, and has learn'd ſomething
of this Traveller that may oblige him to it. This
Obſtacle is ſo great that one muſt not think either of
ſlighting it, or of overcoming it without a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ſpace of time, and a great deal of manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
If a Man preſumes to do the former, he'll
find every body prejudic'd againſt him, when the
Perſon he has ſlighted comes to explain himſelf after
a manner that is diſadvantageous to him: and if he
depends on the latter courſe, he engages himſelf in
a great Charge with more than a moral uncertainty
of ſucceeding in his Deſign.</p>
                  <p>Would it not therefore be much better for our
Traveller to appear free and eaſy in the preſence of
ſuch Perſons, that they may not become ſo cautious,
but may attribute that only to his Curioſity which
by his Impatience he'll give 'em occaſion to impute
to a deſire of knowing the preſent ſtate of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in which they are concern'd? And on
this head it will not be improper to alledg an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of which I have been a witneſs my ſelf. I
happen'd to be in a certain foreign Court, where
there was a Dutch-man who had a great deal of
Wit, and made too great an appearance not to be
ſuſpected; this Perſon deſir'd Audience of one of
the principal Miniſters of State, who in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
making uſe of that right which his Rank and
Authority gave him, ask'd him, <hi>What was the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of his Travels?</hi> The Dutch-man thinking to
make his Court to him, anſwer'd, that <hi>it was to
learn of him as well as by the Example of other Perſons
of his figure, to underſtand the Government of a State.</hi>
The Miniſter coldly replied, <hi>You had need of a great
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57864:150"/>
deal of time, and a ripeneſs of Age to ſucceed in a buſineſs
of this nature.</hi> To which this Stranger made this
fooliſh return, <hi>My Curioſity</hi> (ſays he) <hi>and impatience
after Knowledg may abridg both the one and the other.</hi>
At this Anſwer the Stateſman roſe up and left him,
with theſe words, <hi>For my part, Sir, I perceive I ſhall
contribute nothing to either.</hi> And the Dutch-man was
driven to deſpair to find himſelf ſuſpected by a
Miniſter of State, who had receiv'd him with affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and now look'd upon him as a Man of no
ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Needs any more to be ſaid to ſhew that Curioſity,
which is ſuppos'd neceſſary to a Traveller, ought
not to be impatient? But for this end there's need
of a great deal of judgment, and a good faculty
of diſcerning the Humor of Nations, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of particular Mens Minds, which is a Talent
that one can't communicate to any Man.</p>
                  <p>After all it is not impoſſible not to be impatient
to learn what one goes ſo far to ſeek: for as our
Traveller has not aſſign'd his Voyages a preciſe
ſpace of time, much leſs does he pretend to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
Laws to foreign Nations; 'tis his buſineſs to
accommodate the extent of his Curioſity to the
meaſure of his Capacity, and to proportion the
effects of it to the good ſucceſs he has had in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Diſcoveries: All Occaſions, Seaſons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctures
are not equally proper for this purpoſe.
There are ſome States in which nothing at all
is to be learn'd during the time of War, and
others wherein one can get no information but in
ſuch a time. In one place Peace is an Obſtacle to
politick Diſcoveries, in another War ſhuts up all
the Avenues to the confidence of particular Perſons.
There are ſome Miniſters under whoſe Conduct Men
dare not ſpeak, and others under whoſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
people ſay any thing. Hence it is that ſome
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57864:151"/>
Travellers learn more than others, tho perhaps they
are Perſons of like Ability and Curioſity. And if
I may be permitted to add my Opinion, I ſhall not
ſcruple to ſay, that a Man ought to travel at ſeveral
times and occaſions to the ſame Court, to be well
aſſur'd of Improvement, and that he has penetrated
into the Maxims and Conduct of it.</p>
                  <p>Let any one judg after this, whether Impatience is
not an invincible Obſtacle to Curioſity, and how
great a diſadvantage they muſt be under, whoſe too
great Vivacity precipitates 'em, and whoſe warm
Temper expoſes 'em rather to the Cenſure than
procures 'em the Confidence of foreign Nations.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſtill much worſe when a Man has not ſuch
a politick undetermin'd poſture of Mind as to act
with impartiality, and not to ſhew any prejudice or
a ſtrong inclination to the Maxims of his own
Country on the one hand, and on the other hand
an indifference for thoſe of others. And this being
the great and indeed the original fault that Men
carry into other Countries, one can't too much ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
againſt it, and ſhew the danger of it.</p>
                  <p>Univerſal Reaſon, which is the foundation of
Policy, directs that a Man of Honor part from his
own Country undetermin'd in his Mind, that is, ſo
diſpos'd to learn of all Men according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
Paſſage of the wiſe Man; <hi>Bona enim &amp;
mala ex hominibus tentabit; He ſhall try what is good
and evil among Men:</hi> That he may appear docile
to every Man, and receive any one courteouſly who
is willing to give him any Information. 'Tis not
only uſeleſs but dangerous to travel without this
diſpoſition; for the diverſity of Minds one meets
with being the only remedy againſt Prejudice, an
inconſiderate and heady Traveller often ruins his
Health, as well as corrupts his Reaſon, by every
thing which might otherwiſe improve the one and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57864:151"/>
reſtore the other. 'Twas this that made the late
Elector Palatine ſay, <hi>That Man is a fool that goes out
of his own Country without hopes of returning with
more Honor, Wiſdom and Knowledg than what he carried
abroad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This diſpoſition being ſuppos'd will be followed
by another, and that is, that a wiſe Traveller will
never return undetermin'd in his Mind, as he was
when he went out: But fully convinc'd what is the
greateſt and moſt ſolid Advantage, with which he
has had the addreſs to form his Mind in proportion
to the Capacity he has had of caſting abundance
of differing matters together, only to extract out
of 'em what might contribute to his improvement in
Knowledg.</p>
                  <p>This temper of Mind is more eaſily ſpoken of
than found; for the Mind muſt be moulded after
an extraordinary manner to be capable of that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility
which places a Man at the feet of others to
learn their Inſtructions; and 'tis next to a Miracle
to find a Genius of this Character, which is fix'd
and ſolid enough to come to a determination in the
midſt of ſuch a prodigious number of Maxims
which all reſult from Reaſon as their Principle, tho
the Effects they produce appear ſo oppoſite one to
another. And again there is danger leſt this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility
with which a Man prepares himſelf in going
abroad, ſhould degenerate into Irreſolution, Eaſineſs,
and ſervile Complaiſance at his return. That which
is to be ſeen in the greateſt part of thoſe who are
willing to make too deep and prying a ſearch into
matters of Religion in prejudice to the eſtabliſh'd
Syſtems, who often by their too curious Enquiries
are brought at laſt to ſit looſe from all Religion, and
die in this irreſolution of Mind, often happens to
thoſe middle-witted Perſons whoſe Minds are tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in appearance, but weak in reality, ſo that by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57864:152"/>
the very proſpect of the many different Maxims of
Government, they become uncapable of governing;
becauſe their Minds are not endow'd with a vigor
and heat ſufficient to melt down all ſuch matters
together, and to extract out of 'em only what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
ſutes with the Government of the Country in
which they live.</p>
                  <p>One may every day ſee not only a great many
Travellers, but even Miniſters of State and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,
whoſe Minds are ſo fram'd, that their
Heads turn round inſtead of becoming firm and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at the appearance of ſo many different Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
and Meaſures. On which account the old
Prince <hi>Lubomirski</hi> was wont to ſay, that <hi>ſuch ſort of
Men are ſent abroad to learn the art of being regular
Fools.</hi> Indeed ſuch Perſons appear ſo little furniſhed
with the general Ideas of Policy, and ſo deeply
prepoſſes'd with the particular Maxims of their
own Country, that their Weakneſs is diſcover'd
almoſt as ſoon as they begin to talk.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak yet more plainly for the good of the
publick, 'tis Ignorance that determines the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of ſome Travellers; even before the Maxims
of foreign Countries are known to 'em, they go from
home ſo full of Prejudice, that they are reſolv'd to
return poſſeſs'd with greater Opiniatrety than when
they went out: whence it comes to paſs either that
they can learn nothing becauſe of their prevention,
or elſe they ſee and obſerve ſo much that they can
come to no deciſive Judgment, like thoſe who have
more Victuals in their Stomachs than they have natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
heat to digeſt. To this purpoſe the late Prince
<hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> us'd to ſay; <hi>If theſe Travellers
would learn with a deſign of improving in Knowledg,
they would act becomingly; but to preſume they know every
thing, before they are capable of learning, is the way to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a diſtinguiſh'd Fop.</hi>
                  </p>

And Ignorance in this matter contains in it three
reſpects, which the greateſt part of the World does
not ſufficiently conſider, at leaſt they ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
unite 'em all together. The firſt regards the
Principles of univerſal Policy; which Perſons of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Parts almoſt perpetually confound with the
actual Determinations of the Government of their
Country. 'Tis true, there are every where ſome
Minds more ſublime and judicious, who go to the
bottom of things, and ſeek out means of repairing
the Defects of the Politicks of their Country: but
it generally ſo happens that Perſons of this Genius
are ſeldom advanc'd into favor, and meet with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little Reſpect in a State; whether it be that they
want Docility to accommodate themſelves to the
Humors of others, or Submiſſion to procure them
Patrons, or Ambition to puſh 'em forward. It was
of this ſort of Men that the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> once
ſaid, <hi>They were of the ſame uſe to States, as Props to
old Houſes to hinder their fall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſort of Ignorance reſpects Perſons of
another Genius, who ſurpaſſing the former as well
in Number as Authority, are in poſſeſſion of the
privilege of ſetting a value upon things, and giving
weight to Deciſions that are made: and hence it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
neceſſarily comes to paſs, that that is ſuppos'd
to be beſt and trueſt, which appears to be moſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd,
and moſt generally receiv'd. And this
Miſtake is almoſt irreparable, if we take the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in general, in as much as the number of juſt and
ſublime Minds being every where very ſmall, and
that of narrow Capacities almoſt immenſe in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the other; there is between both a ſort
of middle-ſiz'd Underſtandings, to whoſe Deciſion
thoſe of a ſubordinate Rank pay a blind deference,
which produces that publick Impreſſion which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
on the generality of People, that ſuch as fill
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57864:153"/>
the firſt places in any Government, are ordinarily
the wiſeſt and ableſt Men. This popular Opinion
is often heard without contradiction, and this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
encreaſes the number of the Suffrages that are
given 'em, by which means People are confirm'd
and rivetted in their Ignorance.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> with ſome appearance of Reaſon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
themſelves upon their ſcrupulous care of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the firſt of theſe Inſtances of National Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
becauſe they indeed apply themſelves more
than any other Nation to dive into the Principles
and ſpecial Uſes of univerſal Policy: And we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
hereafter to ſhew what is their Motive, and how
it is ſupported, in a Treatiſe of the Politic Genius
of the United Provinces. But they have too little
firmneſs to keep 'em from falling into the ſecond
Error, which will always mightily check the Projects
they lay in particular Determinations.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> very ſtupidly fall
into all the faults of the firſt Miſtake by their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and contempt of the Principles of Univerſal
Policy, which they ſeem not to know, but only ſo as
to appropriate them to themſelves without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of Actions, Perſons, Intereſts and Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which foils 'em at every turn, and defeats 'em
in all Treaties. But they preſerve among 'em the
liberty of ſpeaking with firmneſs of Mind about
public Affairs againſt the ſecond Inſtance of Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Ignorance: and therefore the Duke of <hi>Holſtein
Ploen</hi> ſaid one day at <hi>Vienna</hi> with a great deal of ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity;
<hi>By the firſt courſe the</hi> Dutch <hi>will ſupport themſelves
a great while, but never advance very far: Whereas the</hi>
Spaniards <hi>have enough to do to ſuſtain themſelves by
reaſon of the actual weakneſs of their preſent Situation;
but if ever they come to recover themſelves, they can't
fail of making a very great advance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:57864:153"/>
The third reſpect of this National Ignorance
proceeds from the Indiſpoſition Men are in to know
others, by reaſon of the little ſincerity and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
they uſe to get the knowledg of themſelves,
which betrays 'em into frequent Miſtakes, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
'em to take the Faults of a Nation for the
Genius of it, and the Art of augmenting thoſe
Faults (inſtead of mending 'em) for Motives of
governing it. Nay more than this, Men are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to miſunderſtand their own Properties which
might be cultivated, and by that means neglect the
Remedies by which they might continually rectify
them.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps theſe Metaphyſical Abſtractions will not
ſute every body's Palat; but I have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
that I ſpeak in general without making a
particular application of things, and am unwilling
to offend any one. However 'tis certain that every
Nation has its faults, its ſingular qualities, its bright
and dark ſides; and if an Inſtance of this be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd,
the love of Riches will one time or other
ruin the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but the indefatigable Induſtry they
are capable of to acquire Wealth, will be their
ſupport a long time. Ambition is a fault in the
<hi>French,</hi> which may run to dangerous Extremes; but
their Valor and Activity will ſerve a great while
to ſuſtain 'em.</p>
                  <p>To avoid being ignorant of any thing that relates
to this, both theſe are to be throughly conſider'd,
and exactly balanc'd one againſt the other; and a
Man ought to be convinc'd by himſelf which ſide
has the greateſt weight, either to do the moſt
Miſchief, or procure the moſt Good. But in good
earneſt do Men uſually begin their Voyages with
ſuch a preliminary Knowledg as this? And yet leſs
than this will not ſuffice to travel to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
and for want of this Diſcuſſion, Men carry
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57864:154"/>
nothing but Ignorance with them into Foreign
Courts.</p>
                  <p>I could advance a great deal on this Head, but
ſhall produce only two Examples, which may ſerve
to inſtruct others, and 'tis in what I have been a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A certain Gentleman that made a good Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and had very great Recommendations (a
fatal help in a Foreign Court when a Man has not
the art of ſupporting them well by his own Conduct)
was ask'd by a Miniſter of State, What was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of his Travels, becauſe he ſeem'd to be of a
weak Conſtitution, and conſiderably advanc'd in
Years, and therefore probably had ſome particular
deſign in view. The Gentleman ingenuouſly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd:</hi>
Sir, I travel to acquaint my ſelf with <hi>Europe,</hi>
and to take occaſion hereafter to make my own Country
acquainted with it. <hi>The Miniſter replied;</hi> If the
Pencil that is to draw your Picture of <hi>Europe</hi> is like that
with which you deſcribe your own Country, there will be
more Fancy than Truth in your Originals. Sir, I can
ſcarce believe <hi>(return'd the Gentleman)</hi> that there are
any more perfect ones than thoſe I have left in my own
Country. <hi>Upon which the Miniſter roſe up and ſaid,</hi>
Sir, you ſeem to me to be rather ſtruck with one certain
Impreſſion than to have a true knowledg of things; you'll
judg of us by that in which you moſt excel: Have a care
that you be not judg'd of here by that in which you are moſt
deficient.</p>
                  <p>This Stranger was caſt into ſo great a perplexity,
when he compar'd this Anſwer with the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments
of Eſteem for his Country, and for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations
he brought from thence, that he was
quite nonplus'd. And tho he would ſeveral times
fain have recover'd himſelf, and endeavor'd by
great Expence, Induſtry and Converſation with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Men to inform himſelf better than he had
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57864:154"/>
done; all ſignified nothing but to give occaſion to
have it ſaid to him at the end of eighteen Months,
<hi>Sir, you had need to come and conſult us; you ſee a
Man learns much if he knows but little when he leaves his
own Country; and that he has made no ſmall advantage,
who has acquir'd by his Travels the art of Learning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond Inſtance is of one who was ſent with
the Charge of a Negotiation to a Court, where he
had Orders to tarry only ſo long as was neceſſary to
perform his Duty, and to wait for an Anſwer. He
came and lodg'd in a Publick Houſe, where he was
complimented on the part of the Chief Miniſter by
an Abbot, who found him ready to ſit down at
Table, very much diſpleas'd at the way of dreſſing
the Victuals which was prepar'd according to the
guſt of the Country: After the firſt Compliments
were paſt, this Envoy could not help ſaying,</hi> What
ſort of a Country have you here, Sir? Here is not ſo
good eating as in other places where I have been, and
nothing near ſo good as at my own Table. Sir, <hi>(ſaid
the Abbot)</hi> Men reaſon here as they ought to do, but
do not much trouble their heads about the art of Cookery;
that they leave to other Nations to carry to the higheſt
pitch of Perfection they pleaſe. What <hi>(reply'd the
Envoy)</hi> can there be juſt reaſoning in a Country where
every thing ſeems out of order <hi>At which the Abbot
roſe up and ſaid,</hi> You ſhall judg of our Country (if
you pleaſe) by your ſelves; and we'll refer our ſelves
in this matter to your Opinion, provided you don't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to ſubject ours to your pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>By the recital of this fooliſh Diſcourſe of the
Envoy, the Miniſter of State had a ſufficient diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of his Character: the day following he came
to his Audience, where nothing was diſcours'd but
State-Affairs; and as he was going out, ſays the
Miniſter in a tone of Railery: <hi>Be ſure to get a good
Dinner, Sir, and pray order your matters ſo as to dine
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57864:155"/>
with me to morrow.</hi> The Envoy did not fail to
come, and oppoſite to him was plac'd one of thoſe
ſecret Cenſors, who penetrate a Man as ſoon as he
begins to open his Mouth, without regard to his
Office, of which they never ſpeak directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly.
He was magnificently regal'd, and at
the time when the Table allows a liberty of free
Diſcourſe; <hi>Well Sir,</hi> ſays this Cenſor, <hi>how d'ye
like this Country? There's nothing but Magnificence</hi>
(ſays the Envoy) <hi>every where, but yet here's one thing
wanting:</hi> to which the other wittily reply'd; <hi>If it
be nothing but your Approbation, we can do well enough
without it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed this Envoy was not long enough at this
Court to improve himſelf by it: for when he left
it he was ſo entirely diſpleas'd with it, that by
ſignifying his Diſguſt, he gave occaſion to 'em to
let him know a thouſand ways, that they were
every jot as much diſguſted with him. At his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
he made a ridiculous Deſcription of this Court:
but Men had need take care what they ſay, for
there happen'd to be a Stranger in the company
who made this diſdainful Reply: <hi>If your own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
(ſaid he) <hi>could not furniſh you with common
Senſe, how could you expect that a Court which you
did but juſt paſs through ſhould teach you what you had
no diſpoſition to learn?</hi> This Repartee was carried
to that Court of which this Envoy had given ſo
unſutable a Character, and 'tis certain he a long
time paſs'd there for the greateſt Fool that ever was
honour'd with a public Employ: Theſe are the
Effects of Ignorance, and a ſottiſh Prejudice.</p>
                  <p>That is never to be learn'd in Travelling which
'tis ſuppos'd a well-bred Man ought to know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he engages in Travels. For the Principles
of Society and Policy are ſo link'd together, that
he that tranſgreſſes the former, renders himſelf ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57864:155"/>
when he ſpeaks, to ſignify ſome unjuſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
that he makes in it.</p>
                  <p>The confounding of a perſonal Determination
of a Miniſter of State, together with a National
Determination, is a ſecond Stumbling-block, againſt
which the greateſt part of inconſiderate and raw
Travellers break their Shins: Who when they are
ſpoken to about the actual Symptoms of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of their Country, on purpoſe to put 'em
upon diſcourſing, if inſtead of intimating by a wiſe
Reply, that they know how to diſtinguiſh the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
and Deſigns of their Country from the
perſonal Motives of thoſe who govern it, which
on that account determine them otherwiſe, they
confound them both together, they paſs for Fools,
and mere Butterflies, that always flutter about that
which caſts the greateſt Light. And after a Man
has once made ſuch a falſe ſtep, let him try as
long as he pleaſes, he'll find it impoſſible to ſet
himſelf right again in the Eſteem of Men of ſenſe,
Railery will take its turn after ſerious Diſcourſe;
and the greater Expence he ſhall be at to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
himſelf into good Company, the more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
will he appear to 'em. And if you tell
theſe ſtupid Creatures, or (if you pleaſe) theſe
pretended Politicians, that they err in the firſt
Principles of Policy, they'll treat you as a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
and whimſical Perſon; nay ſome of 'em
have been ſo ill-temper'd as to endeavour to render
a Man ſuſpected, for having had reſpect and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
enough for his Country to advertiſe 'em of
their Miſtake.</p>
                  <p>The Faults of every Nation are known in all
foreign Countries: Nay they compoſe divers Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms
of 'em, which are not altogether falſe; for
after all, if they are not all of 'em abſolutely true,
there's ſomething in 'em infallibly ſo. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57864:156"/>
it be Prejudice or Time that has given Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to this ſort of Proverbs, 'tis certain who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſhocks 'em, goes for an extravagant Man.</p>
                  <p>The Art of Travelling teaches a Man to keep
his equal diſtance from the Extremities of wholly
denying, or wholly confeſſing ſuch National Faults.
For 'tis equally dangerous to err on either hand,
which very few Perſons conſider: He that denies a
Fault that is imputed to his Country, pulls an old
Houſe upon his head in irritating the People among
whom he reſides at preſent, which muſt needs be a
great piece of Imprudence. Nor is that Traveller
much wiſer who falls into the other Extreme, that
is, coldly and tamely to grant every Story that is
impos'd on his Country; for tho he ſhould capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
ſome vulgar Minds by this Air of Sincerity,
he'll be ſure to get the Reputation of a Fop among
Perſons of Note. 'Tis ſtill worſe when a Traveller
grants that with which his Country is reproach'd,
only to take his turn immediately to twit that
Nation where he is thus attack'd with that Fault
which is imputed to it in our Traveller's Country;
for this is to inſult over People at their own home,
and therefore can't chooſe but irritate 'em. And
the wiſeſt Men will diſapprove of any man's coming
into a Country to reproach it with a Fault, which
'tis always aſham'd to be thought to have, and
perfectly hates to hear laid to its charge. What
then muſt a Man do in this caſe? Why that which
no body will ever teach you, if you neglect to
learn it before you leave your own Country; And
that is, to ſtudy well the Defects and Virtues
of your Country by ſetting 'em in oppoſition one
to the other, that ſo you may oppoſe 'em when
occaſion requires to what is imputed to you, and
may ſpeak of the one, without ſignifying any thing
for or againſt the others, by entering into a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57864:156"/>
Examination and Confutation of 'em. By
this Conduct you'l paſs in Foreign Nations for a wiſe
Man, by this means your Capacity will be known,
and you'l be conſider'd and eſteem'd in proportion
to the Knowledg you appear to have, and to the
Advantage others may have of learning by you
to become acquainted with a Nation which perhaps
they never deſign to ſee. And ſince one Story
draws out another, that which you give concerning
your Country will infallibly procure you the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the Nation where you are; and by this
Addreſs you'll eaſily get a ſolid underſtanding of
what you came to ſeek, namely, the diſcovery of
the Genius, Policy, and Manners of a whole Nation.
This is the Product of Skill in the Art of Travelling.
I'll give one Inſtance which formerly touch'd me
very ſenſibly. A certain <hi>Italian</hi> being in <hi>Lithuania,</hi>
one of the principal Lords of the Country ſaid to
him in Converſation: <hi>Whence is it, Sir, that the</hi>
Italians <hi>never forgive an Injury? My Lord,</hi> reply'd
the <hi>Italian, 'tis becauſe they are never eaſily offended.</hi>
Now this being the great fault of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuanian</hi>
Nobility, the Repartee was very witty, and
as it ſeem'd to me, the moſt ſubtil and ingenious
Cenſure that a Man could paſs on 'em. The <hi>Lithua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Nobleman receiv'd the Impreſſion of it ſo pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
that he even affected to expoſe the fault
of his Country yet farther, in making this return:
<hi>Sir,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>we ſhould be as eaſily offended as you
have been made to believe of us in your Country, if
we could be capable of being diſpleas'd to hear the Truth
told us with ſo good a Grace.</hi> He afterwards pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
him with a Horſe, and order'd that he
ſhould be conducted at his Charge from his Eſtate,
which lies within two days Journy of <hi>Grodnaw,</hi>
as far as <hi>Dantzick,</hi> whither this <hi>Italian</hi> had a mind
to go.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:57864:157"/>
And now let any one put in the room of what
he has been reading, ſuch a diſpoſition of Mind as
the greateſt part travel with, and he'll eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
what is produc'd by that buſy Preference
which determines on the firſt Prejudices, which
are almoſt always falſe, and may eaſily judg by
this whether it was not neceſſary to give the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
a method of Travelling. I intend hereafter
to treat of the Politic Genius of all the Courts of
<hi>Europe,</hi> and hope the manner in which I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of 'em will ſute the reliſh of the World;
becauſe I am to treat of the Facts and Maxims of
common Uſe and Converſation, without which 'tis
impoſſible to penetrate into the true Spirit of
thoſe Courts: And I ſhall begin with the Port, or
Ottoman Court.</p>
