            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An EIGHTH
LETTER
Concerning the
Sacred Trinity;
Occasioned by some Letters to him on that Subject.</head>
            <byline>By JOHN WALLIS D. D. &amp;c.</byline>
            <p>SInce my publishing Seven Letters, and Three Sermons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Sacred Trinity; I have received, on that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
several Letters from divers Persons, (some known, some
unknown,) concerning that Subject. Mostly by way of
Gratulation and Approbation of what I have done. And where
some Expressions therein are not just the same with mine; they are
much to the same purpose, and not at all contrary to what I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to maintain.</p>
            <p>One of them (from an unknown Person) subscribed A. B. was
written (it seems) by a Countrey Gentleman, not a professed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine:
Who though he do not pretend to be much versed in School-Divinity;
yet is, I find, not a Stranger to it. It was left for me
at my Booksellers, with an Intimation, that the Author was willing
to have it Printed. And I left it again with the Bookseller for that
purpose; though it hath been delayed hitherto. Which (because
the Author did desire it) is as followeth.</p>

                        <head>A Letter to the Reverend Doctor
Wallis occasioned by his several
Letters touching the Doctrine of
the Trinity, &amp;c.</head>
                        <opener>
                           <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>'TIS gratitude and acknowledgement directs these lines to you.
I have been so fortunate to meet with your several Letters
in affirmance of the Doctrine of the Blessed Trinity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And cannot but confess my self not only confirmed, but much
enlarged in my notions about that Doctrine by the so plain and pressing
reason of your Discourses. But lest I should seem fond of my own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and fancy to my self that I do comprehend more touching these
matters than I indeed do, I shall humbly offer to you my method of thoughts,
and submit the same to your Grave Judgment and Allowance.</p>
                        <p>THE Metaphysicians I remember teach us that one way to know the
Deity is by way of Eminency, Is there any good or perfection in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
Then, say they, God that is the great Author and Cause of all
things, must be so in a more eminent and high Degree. The Attributes
of God are Competent to man (whom he made after his own Image) in
some measure, but in God they are in the highest and superlative Degree.</p>
                        <p>NOW besides these Eminences and Perfections in the Deity, there are
three more particular and more transcendent Eminences, wherein and
whereby God hath manifested himself to and for the good of Mankind.</p>
                        <p>GOD Almighty was pleased in his infinite Mercy to determine that
Mankind should be rescued from that state of Sin, which the defection of
our first Father brought us into, and be brought back into a state of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But how he should bring about and effect this great work, is out of
the reach of Humane contemplation, and can no otherwise be known, than
as God himself hath been pleased to reveal and discover the same to us in
the Scriptures.</p>
                        <p>NOW the Scriptures intimate to us three several Manifestations of the
Deity in this great work of our Salvation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="13" facs="tcp:106447:2"/>
THE first is that of a Father. That God the Father of Heaven and
Earth, who created the World by his Power, and preserveth it by his
Providence, so loved this World, that he sent his only begotten Son to be
our Saviour and mighty Redeemer.</p>
                        <p>THE second is that of a Son. That Jesus Christ the only begotten Son
of God, undertook this great work of Man's Redemption, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
came into the World, and became Man, a second <hi>Adam,</hi> who by his
holy life, and absolute and perfect obedience to the Will of God, did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
and make atonement for the disobedience of the first.</p>
                        <p>THE third is that of the Holy Ghost, who by his inward operations and
gracious influences, doth incline and prevail with man to embrace the
Redemption purchased for him upon the terms of the Gospel.</p>
                        <p>Now in respect of these three several manifestations of the Deity, there
is said to be a Trinity of persons in the Vnity of the Godhead, and the
same God in respect of one of these manifestations of himself, is called God
the Father; in respect of another is called God the Son; and in respect
of the third is called God the Holy Ghost.</p>
                        <p>THAT there are these three more eminent manifestations of the Deity,
and under these denominations, of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is most
plain in the Scriptures.</p>
                        <p>But the great doubt is whether these be three Personalities in the Deity.
And this doubt (I take it) ariseth from a misunderstanding and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
the true sense of the word <hi>Persona.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>FOR this word <hi>Persona,</hi> I think the Philosophers are short in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions
of it. <hi>Boethius</hi> defines it to be <hi>Naturae Rationalis individua
substantia.</hi> This other Philosophers dislike as too scanty, because it is
applicable to man only, and doth not include Spiritual Beings. And
therefore They to inlarge it, and make it more comprehensive, call it
<hi>Substantia particularis, intelligens &amp; incommunicabilis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>But for my part I cannot but like <hi>Boethius</hi> his definition best, and
think him so far in the right, in that he makes the word <hi>Persona</hi> only
applicable to Man; for so doubtless it is in its true and proper signification;
and it is applicable to Spirits by a Metalepsis only and Transumption of the
Word.</p>
                        <p>AND herein the Philosophers are too short in their definitions of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sona,</hi>
that while they done so much upon the word <hi>Substance,</hi> they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
that Accidents are a more necessary ingredient in its true definition.</p>
                        <p>The word <hi>Persona</hi> in relation to Man, doth not only signifie Individua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and denote a particular or single man, but it doth imply those Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106447:3"/>
also whereby one Man differeth from another. By the word Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
her I do not mean the single Predicament so called, but all the other
Predicaments except that of Substanee, it being those whereby the <hi>Naturae
Rationalis Substantia</hi> is individuated. 'Tis Quantity that differs the
Person of taller Stature from the lower. 'Tis Quality that differs the
Learned from the Vnlearned Person. 'Tis Relation that differs the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the Son. 'Tis the <hi>Ubi</hi> or Locality that differs <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Noke</hi>
from <hi>John</hi> at <hi>Style.</hi> And so of the other Predicaments.</p>
                        <p>I would therefore propose the adding a few words to <hi>Boethius</hi> his defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
and then I think it will be well enough. Let it then be thus, <hi>viz.
Persona est Naturae rationalis individua substantia taliter qualiter
ab aliis differens.</hi> Thus defined it relates to Man only, and so to one
Man as he differeth from another by accidental Individuation. For
though't be true that every Person is a single substance, yet 'tis as true
that they are accidents that do determine the Personality.</p>
                        <p>And as the Specifick differences do constitute the Species, so Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Accidents do constitute the Individual. Thus Rationality doth
constitute the Species of Man, and differs it from that of the Brute. And
thus Wisdom, Fortitude, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do differ this particular Man from another,
and make him to be this Person and not another. Nor can we have any
certain notion of naked substances, or otherwise conceive of them than as
they are clothed with and variegated by accidents.</p>
                        <p>To this purpose also is the true sense and meaning of the Greek word
<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which strictly Translated is in Latine <hi>Subsistentia.</hi> Now
<hi>Subsistentia</hi> doth not only import the <hi>Esse</hi> of the substance, but the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
Essendi:</hi> And what is that doth modifie substance but qualities and
accidents?</p>
                        <p>The Fundamental mistake therefore in this great point hath been in
making the word substance so more than necessary in the definition of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sona,</hi>
and concluding from thence that there cannot be three Persons but
there must be three several substances. Whereas in truth there may be
in the same one particular Man, diversly qualified and circumstanticated,
diverse Personalities. Thus in the Man <hi>Melchisedeck. Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck
King of Salem</hi> may be said to be one Person, and <hi>Melchisedeck
the Priest of the most high God</hi> another. So in <hi>David,</hi> in respect of
his double qualification of a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Prophet.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus much for what I conceive to be the true Notion of <hi>Persona.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="5" facs="tcp:106447:3"/>
Now to consider this word <hi>Persona</hi> as it hath been applyed to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.
And here I must say again, as I said before, that this word <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sona</hi>
is used only in a borrowed sence, and for want of another word that
might more appositely and fully signifie what is intended by it.</p>
                        <p>God cannot properly be said to be a Person. There are no accidents in
him. All his Attributes are Essential to him. That Wisdom that is Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
in Man and Accidental to him, is Infinite in God and Essential to
him. And so of all the other Attributes and Perfections of the Deity,
that are in an imperfect and low degree competent to Man.</p>
                        <p>In this borrowed sence therefore it is that this word <hi>Persona</hi> is applyed
to the Deity; and in respect of those three Eminent manifestations of the
Deity there are said to be three Persons in it. Not that the word <hi>Person,</hi>
and distinction of Personalities in respect of Men doth bear a full Analogy
to the difference of Personalities in the Deity, for in this as in all other
Contemplations of God, we must expect to fall short and not comprehend.
But that the consideration of the different Personalities amongst Men may
help us in some imperfect measure to conceive of that Trinity that we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
in the Vnity of the Godhead.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> But here I expect an Objection, that if in respect of these three
manifestations of the Deity there are said to be three Persons, why are
there not said to be more Persons in the Godhead than three, even as many
as there are Divine Attributes, for so many are the manifestations of the
Deity to us.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> There is not so much reason to imagine more Personalities in the
Godhead than these three, as that there are these three and no more. For
although it be true that every Attribute doth import the Deity, and can
be Predicated of nothing else but the Deity, yet every single Attribute doth
not (if I may so speak) import the whole Deity. His Infinite Wisdom doth
not necessarily import or administer to us the Notion of his Infinite Power.
And so of the other Attributes. But these three several manifestations of the
Godhead, that are called three Persons, are such wherein the whole Deity (as
I may say) doth exert it self, and appear in all its Attributes, and therefore
I call them three more transcendent Eminences or Manifestations of the Deity.</p>
                        <p>Thus I do conceive this Trinity of Persons in the Godhead in some sort
intelligible, without any necessity of thinking that these three Persons must
be three several substances, and consequently three Gods.</p>
                        <p>And I must confess I cannot but think this great dispute a meer wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
business, and a contest more about words than things. For at the same
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106447:4"/>
time that our Adversaries are so fearful of multiplying the Deity by divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the substance, we tell them that we believe in one God only, and that
these three Persons in the Godhead are but one God. So that all the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
is whether to say there are three Persons in the Deity doth necessarity
imply that there are three Substances, which we declare we do not mean
nor intend by it. And for my part if they will as fairly declare that they
believe these three several manifestations of the Deity, <hi>viz.</hi> of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, as held forth to us in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
I would willingly compound with them for the word Person, and
comply with them in the use of any other word they shall find out that may
better or as well express what we mean by it.</p>
                        <p>I come now to the other great Objection of our Adversaries touching the
Hypostatical Vnion. How the Divine and Humane Nature could be
united in the same Person, and this Person be at the same time both God
and Man, and this without multiplying or dividing the Deity, or without
confining the Omnipresent to the scanty Tenement of an Humane Body.
How this God-Man should be born of a Virgin by the overshadowing of
the Holy Ghost, and Humane Nature Propagated without the Natural
help of a Man. These things seem so utterly impossible to these men of great
reason, that therefore they must not, cannot be; and the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
must rather be mistaken or false, than that can be true which they
think cannot.</p>
                        <p>BVT when they argue thus from Impossibility, I wonder their Curiosity
doth not question the Creation it self, how it was possible for God to make
all things of nothing. And for the Hypostatical Vnion, methinks before
they question that so strictly, they ought to give a better account than yet
can be given of the Vnion of the Soul of Man with his Body. And when
they question the being born of a Virgin, may they not as well question how
the first Woman was made of the Rib of a Man: one as well as the other
being supposed to come to pass by the Divine Power.</p>
                        <p>BVT because I am apt (with you) to suspect how far the Scriptures are
of authority amongst these reasoning men, I will adventure to propose to
them one consideration touching the Hypostatical Vnion to shew that it is
not so inconceivable a thing to Humane Reason as they would have
it.</p>
                        <p>Let them but consider the several degrees of Beings that God hath made
in the World. The Trees and Plants to which he hath given Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Brutes to which besides Vegetation, he hath given Animal
life; Senses and Appetites to discern and endeavour after what is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106447:4"/>
to the preservation of their Beings. Then to step further and consider
Man, to whom, besides all these, God hath given a Rational Mind
and Soul. And to step yet further, let them consider those higher Beings
the Angels, what pure Intellectual Beings they are, and what degrees of
perfection God hath given them, beyond what he hath given to Man.</p>
                        <p>I say when we consider these, what necessity is there of limiting and
confining God Almighty here? May we not as reasonably think, that
if in his infinite Wisdom he so thought fit, he might as well make a Being
yet more perfect? Why is it not as conceiveable, that, (to bring about
his own eternal purposes) he might actuate the Humane Nature by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power, and make a Man in whom even the perfections of the Deity
should reside?</p>
                        <p>Is the principle of Essentiality and Vitality any whit divided in or from
the Deity by giving Life and Being to those Creatures?</p>
                        <p>Is the Eternal Mind any whit multiplied or divided by giving a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Soul or Mind to Man?</p>
                        <p>NOR is the Infinite and Eternal Spirit of the World, multiplied or
divided by creating and giving Being to those Glorious Spirits the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
                        <p>What necessity then to think that the Godhead must be either multiplied
or divided, or in any wise varied by acting the Divinity in the Humane
Nature?</p>
                        <p>Oh rebellious Mankind, that hast offended thy Creator; but more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful,
that wilt not accept his Mercy upon his own terms, and believe
it exhibited in that manner that he himself has revealed it!</p>
                        <p>Is it not that God, whose Justice is infinite, that is offended? Is it
not the same God, who is also Infinite in Goodness and Mercy that
is appeased? What room for his Mercy, without derogation to his
Justice, unless there be satisfaction? And what satisfaction can be
competent to the offended Deity? Were Men or Angels fit to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,
or could they make a satisfaction? Surely not. 'Tis his infinite
mercy only that can appease his Justice. <hi>There is Mercy with
him, that he may be feared, yea Mercy rejoycing over Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>NOW because it is inconceivable to man how the offended Deity should
make a satisfaction to it self, God Almighty is pleased thus far to condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
to the Capacity of Humane Nature as to tell us in what manner he
hath done it. <hi>viz.</hi> That he hath sent his only begotten Son into the
World to be born of a Woman to live a life of righteousness for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106447:5"/>
and example, and to dye the Death of Sinners to satisfie for our
defection. And further, that our Original Taint might not prevail over
and misguide us into actual transgressions, he hath sent his Holy Spirit
amongst us to lead us into the ways of Truth and Righteousness. This
he was pleased to promise after the Fall, by his Prophets in the times of
the Old Testament, and has now performed it to us in the times of the
New.</p>
                        <p>Now, is it fit for us to object against this manifestation of his Mercy
to us, and glorious contrivance of our Redemption, because we cannot
comprehend the mystery of it? That surely was ne're meant to be within
our fathom.</p>
                        <p>In the days of the Old Testament when God was pleased to command
the adoration and duty of his People, he manifested himself to them under
several appellations, whereby he put them in mind of his Mercies to them
and their duty to him. I am (says he) the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God
of <hi>Isaac,</hi> and the God of <hi>Jacob.</hi> And so in the Prologue to the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue—I am the Lord thy God which brought the out of the Land of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> out of the House of Bondage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Intimating thereby to them
the great mercies he had shewn in his Miraculous preservation of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs,
and People of <hi>Isreal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So now in the days of the New Testament God Almighty has been
pleased to manisest himself to us under other denominations and appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>viz.</hi> those of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy
Ghost; intimating thereby to us in what manner be hath made good his
promised Mercy, and brought about the great work of our Redemption,
and that under those appellations and manifestations of himself he will now
be worshipped in the times of the Gospel.</p>
                        <p>But for us to understand the great mysteries of our Salvation in
this manner offered unto us, (<hi>viz.</hi> That the Trinity in the Vnity of
the Godhead, and that of the Incarnation of our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) was certainly never intended by God Almighty. And shall
we doubt what God himself tells us because we cannot comprehend
it?</p>
                        <p>When God said to the People of <hi>Israel;</hi> I am the Lord thy God which
brought thee out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. had it been fit for them to
have enquired how he brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to have ravelled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all the Miracles he wrought for that purpose, and to have brought them
to the touch of their understandings, and to have doubted the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106447:5"/>
or the Power of God that did them, because they could not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
them to their own reason?</p>
                        <p>Yet thus ill certainly do they use God Almighty, who will doubt the
Manner of our Salvation, because they cannot understand the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</p>
                        <p>Alas, vain Men, that will not believe what God himself has Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd,
because it will not bear the Test of their weak reason! Do they
think the Wisdom and Power of the Almighty are to be bounded by
the Scanty Limits of their Vnderstanding? That were for what is Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
to comprehend Infinity. God were not God if that were so. And
these very Men, who value themselves so much upon their Reason,
that they think they ought to understand the very <hi>Arcana</hi> of Heaven,
would, I doubt not, be ready enough by the same strength of Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng,
to disown that Deity that they could comprehend.</p>
                        <p>Thus I have presumed (Reverend Sir) to trouble you with this
Draught of my Rude Notions about this matter, which I hope you

THIS Letter being for substance, much to the same purpose
with what I had undertaken to maintain; and the expressions
not much different, and in nothing contrary to it: I shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Reader with any long discourse upon it; because it speaks
sufficiently for it self.</p>
            <p>It hath been suggested to me by another <hi>Anonymous;</hi> That, we
knowing so little of the Infinite Divine Nature, there may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be greater distinction between the <hi>Three</hi> (which we use to call)
<hi>Hypostases,</hi> or <hi>Persons,</hi> than (what he calls) the <hi>Civil or Relative</hi>
acceptation of the word <hi>Person;</hi> (and we may as well Prejudice
the <hi>Truth,</hi> by affirming <hi>too little,</hi> as by affirming <hi>too much.</hi>) And
it is very true; there may be, for ought we know, (and perhaps
there is) <hi>more</hi> than so, (nor have I any where denyed it:) But,
how <hi>much</hi> that <hi>more</hi> is, we cannot tell. Sure we are, <hi>not</hi> so as to be
<hi>three Gods</hi> (or more Gods than one:) And I choose to say (with
St. <hi>Austin</hi>) That <hi>these Three are One Spirit (as we say, they are
One God,) not Three Spirits.</hi> The true <hi>ancient</hi> import of the
Word <hi>Person</hi> (when first applied to the Trinity) implies no more
than as I explained it: Which was a full Answer to the Anti-tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians
<hi>Popular</hi> Argument (from the <hi>modern</hi> gross acceptation of
the Word <hi>Person,</hi> in <hi>English,</hi>) as if <hi>three Divine Persons,</hi> must needs
be <hi>three Gods,</hi> because <hi>three Persons</hi> amongst <hi>Men</hi> doth sometimes
(not always, nor did it anciently so,) imply <hi>three Men.</hi> And,
when we say, these <hi>three Persons</hi> are but <hi>one God;</hi> 'tis manifest that
we use this <hi>Metaphor</hi> of <hi>Persons</hi> (when applyed to <hi>God,</hi>) as borrowed
from <hi>that</hi> sense of the Word <hi>Person,</hi> wherein the same <hi>Man</hi> may
sustain divers <hi>Persons,</hi> or <hi>divers Persons</hi> be the <hi>same Man.</hi> I have
seen, more than once, an Address From <hi>Edward Earl of Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Chancellor of the Vniversity of Oxford,</hi> To <hi>Edward Earl of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon
Lord High Chancellor of England,</hi> (in a Claim of Privilege,
to remove a Cause from the Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> to that of the <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity.</hi>)
Yet these <hi>two Chancellors</hi> were not <hi>two Men,</hi> nor <hi>two
Earls of Clarendon;</hi> but one and the same, sustaining <hi>two Persons,</hi>
(one addressing to the other.) And if this do sufficiently answer
that <hi>Popular Cavil;</hi> 'tis as much as 'twas brought for. If it do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
appear, that the distinction between these Three Divine
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106447:6"/>
Persons be more than so; (but yet more God's than One;) that
may well enough be, though this <hi>Metaphor</hi> do not necessarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
so much. 'Tis certain, that <hi>three Persons,</hi> neither according to
the true import of the words, nor according to the intent of those
who so speak, doth not imply <hi>three Gods:</hi> But <hi>Three Persons which are
One God,</hi> or <hi>One God in Three Persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have also a Third Letter from <hi>W. I.</hi> much to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
with what he had Written in his two former. (And therefore
I do not think it needful to insert it here; nor do I see that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
it.) <hi>It is,</hi> he tells me, <hi>to take his leave of me,</hi> as not mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>give me any farther trouble in this kind.</hi> 'Tis full of divers
expressions of Respect, Thanks, and Approbation; And he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
(as in his two former he had done) upon these two things;
<hi>Not to be too positive</hi> (in these matters) <hi>beyond what the Scripture
tells us;</hi> And, <hi>Not to lay the like stress upon our Argumentations
from thence, as on what we find thore.</hi> In both which (as before I
did) I do fully agree with him. Because, in matters of pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
we know no more than what is Revealed: And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis very sure, that (even in Natural things) Men do oft
mistake in their Argumentations, from Principles which they think
to be True and Clear; (Else it could not be that divers Men,
from the same Principles, should infer contrary Conclusions:) And
because we find it difficult, sometimes, to reconcile some things,
which yet we cannot well deny to be true. And, if it be so, even
in Natural things: much more may it be so in things of an Infinite
Nature. So that herein (I think) He and I do not disagree.</p>
            <p>Yet would I not infer from hence (nor doth he) that we must
therefore be Scepticks in <hi>All things,</hi> because it is possible that in
<hi>Some things</hi> we may <hi>mis-take.</hi> For it is one thing <hi>to be Infallible;</hi>
another thing <hi>not to Err.</hi> A Man who is not Infallible, may yet
Argue Truly; and where he doth so, his Argument is Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive.
And we may accordingly rest in it, and insist upon it, more
or less, according to the degree of Evidence. For things equally
True, are not always equally Evident; nor equally Necessary to
be known. Where the Evidence is not clear (and the matter not
needful for us to know) we are not to be too Positive in our Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
(but rather be content to be ignorant farther than God
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106447:7"/>
is pleased to reveal:) But where it is, (and the things be of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
we must <hi>hold fast that which is true,</hi> and not suffer our selves
to be easily wheedled out of it.</p>
            <p>Which, I suppose, is his Opinion as well as mine. For he
seems to interpose this Caution (particularly) as to that Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis;
to which (as before he had done) he doth suggest some
new Difficulties: But, wherein I am not concerned. That God is
<hi>Trin-unus,</hi> he doth profess. And the word <hi>Person</hi> he doth not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.
But thinks it safe not to be too Positive in determining pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
how great that Distinction of Persons is. In all which, I
do concur with him.</p>
            <p>Now as to the Word <hi>Person</hi> (though I am not fond of Words,
where the Sense is agreed;) I am not willing to quit it, because I
do not know a better to put in the Room of it: And because, if
we quit the word, which the Church hath with good reason made
use of, for so many Hundred years (without any just exception
made to it:) those <hi>Anti-trinitarians,</hi> who would have us quit the
Word, will pretend, that, in so doing, we quit the Doctrine
too.</p>
            <p>That we do not, by <hi>Person</hi> (when applyed to the Sacred Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
understand <hi>such a</hi> Person, as when applyed to <hi>Men;</hi> and, that
by Three <hi>Divine</hi> Persons, we do not mean Three <hi>Gods:</hi> hath been
so often said, and so fully, by those who believe the <hi>Trinity;</hi> that
those who cavil at it, cannot but know it: But by <hi>Person</hi> in the
Deity, we mean only what bears some Analogy, with what amongst
Men is said of several Persons (even without being so many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Men; which the true sense of the word Person doth not
import, as hath been often shewed:) as do the words, <hi>Beget, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
Sending, Proceeding</hi> or <hi>Going-forth,</hi> and many more; which
all are Metaphorical Expressions, taken from what amongst Men
is wont to be said of Persons, (For, of whom, but Persons, are
such expressions used?) And they who use to cavil at it, may as
well do it when we talk of the <hi>Foot</hi> of a Stool, the <hi>Arm</hi> of a
Chair, or the <hi>Head</hi> of a Staff; And perswade us, that when we
so speak, we do believe a <hi>Stool,</hi> a <hi>Chair,</hi> a <hi>Staff,</hi> to have <hi>Life</hi> and
<hi>Sense,</hi> because a Foot, an Arm, a Head (properly taken) have so
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106447:7"/>
And they may as well cavil at the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> (which is a
Name that we have given to that of Baptism and the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;)
<hi>Attributes,</hi> (which is a term we give to some of the Divine
Perfections:) <hi>Creed,</hi> (by which we mean an Abstract of some Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
things that we Believe:) And a great many such other words
that we find occasion to make use of: Whereof yet there is no danger,
when it is defined and determined what by such word, in such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
we mean; even though, in some Other discourses, such word
may signifie otherwise. 'Tis well known, that a <hi>Cone</hi> in <hi>Euclide</hi> doth
not signifie just the same as in <hi>Apollonius;</hi> nor a <hi>Triangle</hi> in <hi>Euclide,</hi>
just the same as in <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and others, who Write of Sphericks:
But when we meet with these words in <hi>Euclide,</hi> we must there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
them as they are defin'd by <hi>Euclide;</hi> and when in others,
so as they are defin'd by those others. And so when we speak of
Persons in the Deity, we must be so understood as we there define:
that is, for somewhat Analogous, but not just the same, with what
is meant by it, when applyed to Men; and, particularly, <hi>not</hi> so
distinct as to be <hi>three Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, for the same Reasons, I am not willing to part with the
<hi>Athanasian Creed;</hi> lest those who would have us so do, should then
say, We have parted with the Doctrine also. They, upon pretence,
that some expressions in it, though True, are not absolutely Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental;
would fain wheedle us out of all. They might as well
say, that, because some words might be spared in what we call
the <hi>Apostolick</hi> Creed, or <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed; or some other words put
in; therefore those Creeds should be laid aside also. And when
they quarrel with the <hi>Preface</hi> of it, <hi>(Whoever would be saved, ought
to hold the Catholick Faith; and the Catholick Faith is this;)</hi> as if
it were intended thereby, that every Syllable in it were so Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,
as without knowing whereof, a Man could not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
(which no Man can reasonably think to be so meant by the
Penners of it; since that Thousands were saved (even in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion)
before that was Penned; and others since, that never heard
of it;) is mere Cavilling. For no more can reasonably be thought
intended by it, but that this is found Doctrine, which, <hi>for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
of it, ought to be believed by those who would be saved:
Like as if I should say, <hi>Who ever would be saved, ought to believe
the Word of God; and this is the Word of God,</hi> (pointing to our
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106447:8"/>
Bible;) no Man (who is not mad) would think my meaning to
be, That no Man could be saved who did not know that one of
<hi>Iob</hi>'s Daughters was Named <hi>Iemimah;</hi> or that <hi>Zeruiah</hi> was <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
(not <hi>Father</hi>) to those who are called <hi>the Sons of Zeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to that Question (which I meet with in some of the Letters)
<hi>Why just Three Persons, and no more:</hi> The <hi>Answer</hi> is short and easie;
Because the Scripture tells us of <hi>Three,</hi> but of <hi>no more.</hi> (And, had
not the Scripture told it us, we had not known of these Three.)
We are <hi>Baptized</hi> into the Name of (and therefore into the Faith
of) <hi>the Father, Son and Holy Ghost;</hi> (as if this were the <hi>First Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Creed.)</hi> We are told, <hi>There are Three that bear record in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi>
and, <hi>these Three are One:</hi> (not, that there are more such
than Three:) And to <hi>these Three</hi> (somewhats) we give the Name
of <hi>Persons;</hi> meaning, by the Word <hi>Persons,</hi> these <hi>Three.</hi> And if
by <hi>Persons</hi> in the Deity we mean but these <hi>Three;</hi> then there are
but <hi>Three</hi> in the Deity whom we call <hi>Persons;</hi> or, whom we mean
by that Name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is another Ingenious Person (a stranger to me) who
hath Written to me divers Letters on this occasion, (full of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation,
Approbation and Applause:) but in one of them he
moves a Question concerning a passage in one of mine; where I
say,</hi> We have no Notions in our Mind, other than what we derive,
Mediately or Immediately, from Sensible Impressions of Finite Corporeal
Beings: <hi>And tells me,</hi> That it seems to him, that the Notion of
<hi>ONE INFINITE ESSENCE</hi> should be excepted. <hi>And
that he hath formerly</hi> Vindicated <hi>Des Cartes</hi> against Mr. <hi>Hobs,
who had affirmed,</hi> That there is no Conception in a Man's Mind,
which hath not at first totally, or by parts, been begotten upon the
Organs of Sence: <hi>and again,</hi> That a Man can have no Thought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
any thing not subject to Sense.</p>
            <p>But, in a following Letter, he declares himself <hi>fully satisfied,</hi>
(and that <hi>my Sentiments do not really differ from his,</hi>) when I had
sent him this Answer, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>As to what you say of my affirming, that <hi>we have no Notions in
our Mind, other than what we derive, mediately or immediately,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106447:8"/>
from sensible Impressions of Finite Corporeal Beings:</hi> When you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it again, I believe you will be of my Mind. If you can
suppose a Man in such circumstances, as never to have <hi>Seen,</hi> or
<hi>Heard,</hi> or <hi>Felt</hi> any thing: I doubt whether he would have any
Thoughts of God, more than an Embryo yet unborn, (who
hath the <hi>same Soul,</hi> that he will after have; but hath, I doubt,
as yet, no Notions of a God.) Sure I am that we attain it by
other Steps. <hi>The Heavens declare the Glory of God:</hi> But not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being <hi>Seen,</hi> or at least <hi>Heard</hi> of, or some way <hi>made known</hi>
to us by <hi>Sensible Impressions. The Invisible things of him (even his
Eternal Power and Godhead) are clearly seen;</hi> but it is <hi>by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World; being understood by the things that are made.</hi> But
if we neither <hi>See,</hi> nor <hi>Hear of,</hi> nor have any <hi>Notion</hi> of the <hi>things
that are made;</hi> how shall we <hi>thence</hi> derive the <hi>Notion</hi> of a <hi>God?</hi>
and there must be many Notions, <hi>antecedent</hi> to that of <hi>One Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Essence,</hi> (which must be derived from <hi>sensible Impressions</hi> of
<hi>Corporeal</hi> Beings.) We must have the <hi>Notion</hi> or <hi>Conception</hi> of
<hi>Ens, Esse, Finis, Finitum, Non-finitum, Vnum, Non-nullum,
Non-multa;</hi> before we can have the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>One Infinite Essence.</hi>
And those <hi>Antecedent Notions,</hi> I think, we do derive (mediately
or immediately) from what we See, Hear, Feel, or some way
apprehend by the help of our <hi>Sences.</hi> As to <hi>Des Cartes;</hi>
there must be a great many <hi>Notions,</hi> or <hi>simple Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
which he must <hi>presume,</hi> before he can come to the
<hi>Complex Notion</hi> of <hi>Deus Est.</hi> And a great many <hi>Illative Notions</hi>
(from Natural Logick) before he can argue, <hi>Cogito, ergo sum.</hi>
He must at least have a <hi>Notion,</hi> or <hi>simple Apprehension,</hi> of what is
meant by <hi>Cogito,</hi> and of what is meant by <hi>Sum,</hi> and of what by <hi>Ego:</hi>
And then a <hi>Complex Notion,</hi> that <hi>what is not, cannot Think:</hi> And
then this <hi>Illative Notion</hi> (from Natural Logick.) But, <hi>I Think,</hi>
Therefore <hi>I am.</hi> And, I doubt, he cannot come at all this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some use of his <hi>Senses.</hi> And, even after all, it seems to me,
that <hi>to Be</hi> is a Notion more simple (and therefore antecedent)
than <hi>to Think;</hi> and therefore soone to be apprehended by it
self, than by consequence from that. But it is not now my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
to Dispute against <hi>Des Cartes.</hi> Onely to shew, that <hi>Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Notions are subservient to our Notions of a God; and,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106447:9"/>
from These our Understandings do, by steps, ascend to
These.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Answer, he owns <hi>my Sentiments to be the same with
his,</hi> &amp;c. that <hi>(in a Natural way) the Humane Intellect hath no O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
but what is Occasioned, or Suggested by Sensible Objects.</hi>
But he thinks, I perceive, (and so do I,) that from these No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
occasioned or suggested by Sensible Objects, our Intellect, or
Reason improved, may ascend, by steps, to a Discovery of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
concerning God, which, in Corporeal Objects it cannot find;
In which we both agree.</p>
            <p>Now the best means we have for the forming of such Notions
concerning God, is chiefly by one of these two ways; that of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency,</hi>
and that of <hi>Negation.</hi> Whatever of Good, or Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
we find in the Creature, we conclude that in God (who is
the fountain of all Excellency) there is somewhat Analogous
thereunto, but <hi>much more</hi> Eminent. And whatever of Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
we find in the Creature, we conclude, that in God (who
is Infinitely Perfect) there is nothing of this Imperfection. And,
from both, we conceive a Notion of somewhat in God, which is
<hi>more Great</hi> than is possible for us fully to comprehend: But, what
that somewhat is, we cannot fully understand, Now, these being
the Steps, by which we <hi>form</hi> these Notions; we know no better
way to <hi>express</hi> these Conceptions, than by Metaphors taken from
such Objects, from whence these Notions take their Rise, or some
such <hi>Figurative</hi> Expressions. (And it was with this Prospect that
I mention'd that Observation.) And, in the same way, God is
pleased (in Scripture) to express himself to us; by somewhat A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogous
(not just the same) with what we meet with in the
Creature; As when it speaks of God's <hi>Eyes, Ears, Hands, Feet,</hi> &amp;c.
of his <hi>Seeing, Hearing, Striking, Going,</hi> &amp;c. So when the <hi>Father</hi>
is said to <hi>Beget;</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> to be <hi>Begotten;</hi> and both these to <hi>send out,</hi>
and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to <hi>Proceed,</hi> or <hi>Go forth</hi> from them. All which
expressions are such, as we commonly apply to what we call <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
And in what sense those are to be understood concerning
God; in such sense they are fitly called three <hi>Persons.</hi> And those
who in such sense cavil at the word <hi>Person;</hi> would no doubt (if
there were not somewhat else in the Wind) as well cavil at those
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106447:9"/>
other words. But because, so to do, were directly to affront the
Scripture (whose words they are) they do not think fit so to speak
out, whatever they think. When Christ saith, of himself and the
Father, <hi>John 16. 28. I Came forth from the Father, and am Come into
the World; again, I Leave the World, and Go to the Father:</hi> Of Himself
and the Holy Ghost, <hi>ver. 7, 8. If I Go not away, the Comforter will
not Come unto you; but if I Depart, I will Send Him unto you; and when
He is Come, He will Reprove the World,</hi> &amp;c. Of himself and the other
two, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 26. and 15. 26. <hi>The Comforter which is the Holy
Ghost, whom the Father will Send in My Name, He shall Teach you all
things, and Bring all things to your Remembrance whatsoever I have Said
unto you.</hi> And again, <hi>When the Comforter is Come, whom I will Send
you From the Father, even the Spirit of Truth which Proceedeth from the
Father, He shall Testifie of Me:</hi> What could be said, as of Three
<hi>Persons,</hi> more distinctly? And if the Scripture speak of them as
<hi>Three Persons;</hi> why should we scruple to call them so? But these
<hi>Three Persons</hi> are but <hi>One God.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. These <hi>Three</hi> are
<hi>One; Vnum</hi> (not <hi>unus) One Thing, 1 Iohn</hi> 5. 7. And <hi>John 10. 30.
I and the Father are One;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>(unum sumus)</hi> we are One and
the same Thing; and therefore <hi>One God.</hi> And, that there is <hi>no
other God but One,</hi> is known to be so often said that I need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
it.</p>
            <p>But 'tis not so much the word <hi>Person,</hi> is the <hi>Deity of Christ,</hi>
which these Men are offended at; and all their Cavils at the word
<hi>Person,</hi> (and the <hi>Athanasian Creed,</hi>) are but to undermine our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
<hi>Deity.</hi> Of this I have said enough elsewhere, and need not
here repeat it. <hi>The LORD our God is One LORD, Deut.</hi> 6. 4. That
is, The Lord God of <hi>Israel</hi> is One Lord; or <hi>Iehovah</hi> the God of
<hi>Israel</hi> is One <hi>Iehovah.</hi> There are not more <hi>Iehovah</hi>'s than One:
And this One <hi>Iehovah</hi> is <hi>the Lord God of</hi> Israel. And <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 3, 5.
I <hi>the LORD</hi> (Jehovah) <hi>am the God of</hi> Israel: <hi>I am the LORD</hi> (Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah)
<hi>and there is none else. There is no God beside Me:</hi> (No God
beside the Lord God of <hi>Israel.</hi>) So in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 15. and many
other places to the same purpose. Now our <hi>Christ,</hi> is this <hi>Lord
God of</hi> Israel, <hi>Luke 1. 16, 17. Many of the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>shall He
(Iohn</hi> the Baptist) <hi>turn to the Lord THEIR God,</hi> (to the Lord
God of <hi>Israel;) and he (John Baptist) shall go before Him,</hi> (this
Lord God of <hi>Israel) in the Spirit and Power of</hi> Elias. Now no Man
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106447:10"/>
doubts but that it is our Christ, whose <hi>Fore-runner John Baptist</hi>
was; and before whom he was to <hi>go in the Spirit and Power of</hi> Elias.
Therefore our <hi>Christ</hi> is this <hi>Lord God of</hi> Israel: This <hi>One IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true that the Greek <hi>Septuagint</hi>'s Translation of the Old Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament
doth not retain that word, but doth every where wave the
word <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and puts <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> instead of it. And accordingly,
the New Testament (which mostly follows the Language of that,
the only Greek Translation then in use) doth so too. But <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
(which they substitute for <hi>Iehovah</hi>) is so oft applied to Christ
(even in those places cited out of the Old Testament wherein <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi>
is used) that none can be ignorant of it.</p>
            <p>And though we have not there the word <hi>Iehovah,</hi> yet we have
as full a Periphrasis of it as can be desired. 'Tis well known (and
owned by all) that the two Proper Names of God, <hi>Iah</hi> and <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi>
are derivatives from the Verb <hi>Hajah</hi> or <hi>Havah</hi> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
<hi>to Be,</hi> (which whether we take for one and the same Root,
or Two Roots of one and the same signification, is not material;
the Letter <hi>Iod</hi> and <hi>Vau</hi> in Hebrew being so oft used promiscuously,
or one changed for the other:) And therefore the Noun Verbal
must needs import <hi>a Being.</hi> And it hath been further observed
long since by Hebricians, that the Name <hi>Iehovah</hi> hath moreover
the peculiar Characteristicks of the Three <hi>Times,</hi> (past, present,
and future,) <hi>Ie</hi> the Characteristick of the <hi>Future</hi> Tense; <hi>Ho,</hi> of
the Present Tense or Participle; and <hi>Va</hi> of the Preter Tense,
(which I did forbear to mention formerly, lest they should throw
it off as a Criticism; till I had a fresh Voucher for it, so good as
Dr. <hi>Pocock</hi> in his late Commentary on <hi>Ioel.</hi> Chap. 1. 19.) And
we have all this in that Character of God (indefinitely) <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 4.

<hi>I am</hi> Alpha <hi>and</hi> Omega, <hi>saith
the Lord God</hi> (Jehovah Elohim) <hi>which Is, which Was, and which

<hi>Iehovah</hi> (here Translated, as elsewhere, by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) with a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
upon it, importing his <hi>Being,</hi> with the three diversities of <hi>Times,
(past, present, and future,</hi>) and his <hi>Omnipotence</hi> superadded. <hi>That

               </gap> (so <hi>Beza,</hi> and so Dr. <hi>Pocock</hi>
reads it, and so ours Translate it.) And much to the same
purpose is that <hi>Rev. 1. 11, 17, 18. Rev.</hi> 2. 8. (and elsewhere)
<hi>I am</hi> Alpha <hi>and</hi> Omega, <hi>the beginning and the end, the first and the
last; he that liveth and was dead, and behold I live for evermore.</hi>
So <hi>Rev. 4. 9, 11. Rev. 5. 12, 13, 14 Who liveth for ever and ever.</hi>
Which fully answers that Title, <hi>The Living God,</hi> whereby the <hi>True
God</hi> doth so oft distinguish himself from other Gods; as <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. 10.
and elsewhere frequently. But I have said so much formerly to this
point, that I shall now add no more.</p>
            <p>I had almost forgotten one piece, (wherein I find my
self mentioned) Intituled, <hi>A suit for forbearance,</hi> &amp;c. It
aims chiefly at two things. One is against <hi>arging (on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
too strict an Vnion, wherein Christianity, as delivered by our
Lord and his Apostles, hath left a Latitude and Simplicity:</hi> But <hi>herein</hi>
I think, he hath no cause to blame me (nor do I see that he
doth) He doth not find me to trouble him with <hi>cramping Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastick
Terms.</hi> I know not how I could speak more tenderly than
to say <hi>these Three</hi> are three <hi>Somewhats,</hi> (not three <hi>Nothings;</hi>) and
if he please to sport himself with that, he may. And, that 'tis
convenient, to these <hi>Somewhats,</hi> to give a Name; and, that I know
no better Name than <hi>Persons;</hi> And, therefore, that we may still say
(as we were wont to do) <hi>three Persons and one God;</hi> even though
by <hi>Person,</hi> I do not require Men to fancy just <hi>such</hi> a Person, as
what we so call amongst Men. Like as by <hi>Father, Son, Beget,</hi> &amp;c.
I do not understand (in God) <hi>just such</hi> as what these words signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
amongst Men. And I do not know how he could wish me to
speak more tenderly, or more agreeing to the <hi>Christian Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
wherein it is delivered by our Lord and his Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other is; He thinks it not Adviseable in things <hi>sufficiently
setled by just Authority (as is that of the Trinity) to revive a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
long since determined, and draw the Disputatious Saw: Because,
to litigate about a Fundamental, is to turn it into a Controversie.</hi> And
herein, I am so much of his Mind, that I would not have advised
to start the Controversie, about what we have been <hi>in quiet possession
of,</hi> for so long a time. And I am ready to own, That it is an Art
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106447:11"/>
of our Adversaries the <hi>Papists,</hi> to perswade the World that we
have no better ground for the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> than they
have for <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi> (for they care not what they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
if thereby they may advance their own ends:) And, That
<hi>Atheistical and Irreligious Men</hi> will be glad of any opportunity to
Ridicule Religion.</p>
            <p>But if others will make it their business to <hi>run down Religion;</hi>
and profess to the World, there is nothing but <hi>Authority to define
it</hi> (which they despise;) and no <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Scripture</hi> for it, more
than for <hi>Transubstantiation:</hi> I think we are not obliged to stand
(all of us) so silent, as if we had nothing to say for it, or yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up the cause. There is a middle way (for the promoting what
he calls <hi>a Purer and more Scriptural Divinity.</hi>) between a rigorous
imposing all the <hi>Scholastick Cramping Terms;</hi> and, a giving up the
Cause. A modest defence of what the Scripture teacheth us,
(without Excursions into a rigorous pressing of Extravagant Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of our own Inventions) may be of good subserviency, to
shew, that the Doctrines of our <hi>Religion</hi> are not inconsistent with
<hi>right Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What he tells us of some body who had been heretofore</hi> Master
of the Temple, <hi>that did express himself to this purpose,</hi> The Substance
of God, with this Property, To be of none, doth make the Person of the
Father; The very self same Substance in number, with this Property,
To be of the Father, maketh the Person of the Son. The same Substance
having added to it the Property of Proceeding from the other Two, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Person of the Holy Ghost. So that, in every Person, there is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
both the Substance of God, which is One, and also that Property
which causeth the same Person really and truely to differ from the other
Two. <hi>This, I say, would pass with me well enough. And if
he please so to express himself, I should not quarel with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again; If I should express it thus, That God considered as the
Original or Fountain of <hi>Being</hi> (who himself <hi>Is</hi> and gives <hi>Being</hi> to
all things else) may be called <hi>God the Father,</hi> (or <hi>The God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of all:</hi>) And the same God, as the Fountain of <hi>Wisdom</hi> or
<hi>Knowledge;</hi> be called <hi>God the Son,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>Word, Wisdom</hi> or
<hi>Reason; The true Light, that lighteth every Man that cometh into the
World,) Gods Wisdom</hi> resulting from his <hi>Essence</hi> or <hi>Being:</hi> And the
same God, as the Fountain of <hi>Power, Might</hi> or <hi>Action;</hi> be called
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106447:11"/>
               <hi>God the Holy Ghost;</hi> (Gods power of <hi>Acting,</hi> proceeding from his
<hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> also:) And this <hi>Eternal, All-wise,</hi> and <hi>Almighty</hi>
God, is <hi>One God:</hi> Perhaps he would not much mislike this. Or,
if he should; I would not quarel with him on that account; or be
Positive that it must just be so. We know that Christ is called <hi>the
Wisdom of God;</hi> the <hi>Son of God;</hi> the <hi>Son of the Highest:</hi> And the
<hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is called the <hi>Power of the Highest.</hi> And we know that,
amongst our selves, <hi>Knowledge</hi> results from the <hi>Essence</hi> of our Soul;
and <hi>Action</hi> proceeds from <hi>Both.</hi> 'Tis said also, that <hi>in Him we Live,
and Move, and have our Being.</hi> (From God we have our <hi>Being,</hi>
our Rational <hi>Life,</hi> and our <hi>Motion:</hi> In whose <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Likeness</hi>
we are Created.) Yet would I not be positive (much less would
I require every one to be of that Opinion) that the Personalities
in God must needs be These. I am content to rest here, That
These <hi>Three,</hi> Father, Son, and Holy Ghost (whatever Name you
call them by) <hi>differ in somewhat</hi> (more than what we commonly
call the Divine Attributes) <hi>yet not so as to be Three Gods</hi> (or more
Gods than One;) <hi>but are One and the same God.</hi> And so far we be
safe. Nor is there any danger (that I can see) in giving the
Name of <hi>Persons</hi> to these <hi>Three:</hi> Nor know I a fitter Name to give
them.</p>
            <p>And this, I think, is as much as need be said, as to all those Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which, on this Occasion, have come to my Hand, since the
Publishing of those already Printed. There being nothing in all
these which is contrary to what I therein undertook to defend.
(Nor should I have said thus much, if the Author of the Letter
here inserted had not desired to have it Published.) And now I hope
to trouble the Press no more upon this Occasion.</p>
