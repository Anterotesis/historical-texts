            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SInce the Wiſdom of thoſe Beneficent Patriots (who have ſo illuſtriouſly preſerv'd the Liberties and Privileges, and advanced the Trade, and Riches off the People, whom they repreſent) hath choſen you to be their Orator upon the approaching <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

            <p>It is not enough that you deal tenderly with the memory of that great Saint and Hero his Royal Highneſs <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> (who by your own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples was the Lord's Anointed, and ſet over theſe Nations by a Deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from above, by a continued ſeries of mighty victories, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your arguing as truly diſcover'd him to be the Vicegerent of Heaven, as Prophecy did the Kings of <hi>Iſrael)</hi> but you are obliged to ſpeak honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of that eminent Benefactor to this People, who ſet a Pattern to future Ages how to treat Tyrannical Kings. Make a Panegyrick in his praiſe, and raiſe your Voice to a due pitch, that the Audience may admire an Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence adequate to the grandeur of the Subject; and that you may be in all things juſt to your Principles, treat that Man, whom the laſt Age fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made a Martyr, and fome few in this think ſo as he deſerved; the Man, whom the People accuſed of endeavouring to introduce Popery and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power; and who by following as undue courſes, as his Son, brought himſelf to the Block; treat him magiſterially, and with that aſſuming, that is inſeparable from men of your profound parts; treat him, as you have done the <hi>little Writers</hi> amongſt the <hi>Jacobites</hi> (whom inſtead of anſwering you contemn) or as your dear ſpouſe treats you, when you fail of dutiful compliance; exalt your well furniſh'd Forehead, lift up your Voice like a Trumpet, that Voice that hath been all along ſpared for this infamous oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; call upon the Nation to rejoice at the downfall of its Enemies, and exhort them to maintain their Rights againſt the incroachments of inſolent Princes, who ſuck the blood, and prey upon the marrow of thoſe, whom they ſhould gently govern, ſettle the Power of the People over Kings, and prove God an acceſſary to all their proſperous Rebellions and Perjuries. You know the vindication of theſe Opinions was the purchaſe of your <hi>Deanery,</hi> and men uſe to maintain what they have gotten, by ſúch methods as they got it by; I cannot call it Simony, that old Magician was a fairer Merchant, he would have purchaſed the Gifts and Powers of the Holy Spirit (things of great excellency and uſe, while you leave the ſacred aſſiſtances of the Church to ſuch ſilly Chapmen, and purſue the nobler quarry of its more ſacred honors and revenues.</p>
            <p>Advice thoſe grave Senators to make ſolemn ſanctions againſt all your former old obſtinate Friends, counſel them to eſtabliſh a Tax upon every man's head, like the <hi>Haracht Musſlemen</hi> upon the poor <hi>Greeks;</hi> commend the example of thoſe ſage <hi>Ottomans</hi> to the imitation of our no leſs wiſe and merciful <hi>Commons;</hi> who, even when they acknowledge the Bible to be the word of God, make it meritorious to murther all thoſe, who profeſs to live according to its Rules.</p>
