            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER
FROM A
TROOPER
In Flanders, to his Comerade:
SHEWING,
That Luxemburg is a Witch, and deals with
the Devil.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Honest TOM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Know thou dost remember, that while thou wast amongst us,
Things went but untowardly; and that having mighty For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
enough one would have thought to have conquer'd the
World, we made nothing on't, but were still on the losing hand:
And since thy leaving us, Things have gone on after the same Rate.
We are told a Fellow call'd an <hi>Observator</hi> should say, That though
we have a brave Army, yet we want Conduct. But I would have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93091:2"/>
him to know, That we have as good Conduct as any is under the
Copes of Heaven. What the Devil then is the Matter? Or how
come these Things about? I have been often Musing what the
Matter should be; and at last I have found it out. In plain Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
<hi>Tom,</hi> we have been bewitch'd. This damn'd Rogue <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
this crooked urchinly Rogue, and the Devil together, have
bewitch'd us all this while. As for the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> who commanded
the <hi>French</hi> last Summer, or at least had the Name of it, I suspect
him not: For we all know that the <hi>Dauphin</hi> is no Conjurer. But
we have been bewitch'd as sure as I am here; and none but <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburg</hi>
could thus bewitch us.</p>
            <p>Thou knowest, <hi>Tom,</hi> that at the beginning, we talk'd of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
less than Marching into <hi>France,</hi> and Carrying the War into
<hi>France.</hi> And we had Forces sufficient for that purpose, both then,
and many times since; the <hi>French</hi> not daring to fight us. If they
had, we should have beaten them to Clouts. By our carrying the
War thus forward, we should have lived upon the Enemy; and
should have tumbled in Free Quarter, and Contributions, and
Plunder. But instead of this, we have kept still in <hi>Flanders;</hi> lying
heavy upon it, and plainly devouring it. Nor have we ever had
our Foot upon <hi>French</hi> Ground. So that I conclude we have been
bewitch'd; and that a Spell hath been laid before us, which we
had not the Power to pass over.</p>
            <p>I meant, by <hi>French</hi> Ground, not only their own Country of
<hi>France,</hi> but their Conquests also; or generally, the <hi>French</hi> Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
And I say again, That we have not been in the <hi>French</hi>
Quarters ever since this War; that is, not with our main Army.
For I confess Duke <hi>Wirtenburg</hi> with a Detachment, and Count <hi>Thian</hi>
with a Party, have been in those Quarters; though their Stay and
their Reign were very short. Marry your <hi>Gazette</hi> did publish. That
our main Army (upon our late March to <hi>Rouselaer,</hi> where we
encamp'd so long to so little purpose) was in the Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
But that's a damn'd Lye. For the Enemies Country (we
all know) is that which is beyond, and within their Frontier
Garisons: Whereas this Place is on this side their Frontier, and
between their Frontier and ours; and pays Contribution to us, as
well as to them. So, I remember, three Years ago, when our
Army had passed the <hi>Sambre,</hi> and was got as far as <hi>Beaumont,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:93091:2"/>
Fools gave out that we were in the Enemies Quarters. But we
were but Nine or Ten Miles from <hi>Charleroy,</hi> which was then Ours,
and within the Contribution of that Garison. And the like may
be said of <hi>Walcourt,</hi> where we had been before that time.</p>
            <p>Thou seest now, that we can come near the Enemies Country;
though even That doth seldom happen: But we can't get into it,
for the Heart-blood of us. Though we desire it above all Things;
and though we want neither Strength, nor Courage, nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
And therefore thou may'st be satisfied, as well as I, That
the Devil has hinder'd us, and that we have been bewitch'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> run every foot into Our Country, and why should
not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We do the like into Theirs? Are we affraid of an Action of
Trespass? We had once <hi>Namur, Charleroy,</hi> and <hi>Mons,</hi> all abreast;
and it was a noble Frontier. But the <hi>French</hi> made nothing to pass
through this Frontier, and to lie in the heart of our Country, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
those Places and <hi>Brussels;</hi> where they were as safe as a Thief
in a Mill. Not a Quarter ever beaten up, or so much as attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And this they would do, even when they were forced to
avoid fighting, our Army being stronger than theirs. <hi>Tom,</hi> we
have been invaded Year after Year, by an Enemy that durst not
fight us: But whether this could be done without Witchcraft, I
leave Thee to judge. And I know thou art a great Judg in these
Matters: We have many great Officers, that cannot judge half
so well.</p>
            <p>Prethee <hi>Tom</hi> give me leave, for otherwise I must take it, to add
one Word more. I say then, That by these Doings poor <hi>Flanders</hi>
hath been sadly burden'd, being made the perpetual Seat of War:
When in the mean time the <hi>French</hi> Quarters lie fresh and untoucht.
And this hath made them so Rampant as they are. But if we had
lain upon their Country as long as they have done upon ours, they
would have been in a very bare and low Condition.</p>
            <p>Ay but, thou'lt say, We cannot fall into the <hi>French</hi> Quarters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their Lines. Very good. And these Lines shew yet more:
plainly, That there is Witchcraft in the Case: For they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be defended without the help of the Devil. They reach from
<hi>Dunkirk</hi> upon the Sea, to <hi>Pont Espiers</hi> upon the River <hi>Scheld;</hi> which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93091:3"/>
is near Forty English Miles. From whence to <hi>Conde</hi> (along that
River, which here serves for a Line) is near Twenty Miles more.
And from <hi>Conde</hi> to <hi>Namur,</hi> it is almost Fifty Miles. Now I leave
thee to consider, whether Lines of this length could be defended
without Witchery. And herein lies the Witchery, That we have
not the Power to attempt them. For when we did attempt them,
(which we have done but twice, and that was under <hi>Wirtemberg</hi>
and <hi>Thian,</hi>) we broak through them with Ease.</p>
            <p>Thou seest, by what I have written, That I am very fond of
getting into the Enemies Country. Others are rather for besieging
and taking their Frontier Towns. And so am I, when we are
able to do it. But this requires a great Odds in Power: One
Army for the Sieges, and another to confront the Enemy. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
we may march into their Country, when ever we dare fight.
What, go beyond their Frontier Garisons? Ay, beyond them.
Why should not We do it as well as the <hi>French?</hi> And Garisons
signify nothing against a Commanding Army; no more than so
many Crows Nests. An Army that dares Fight, and yet dares not
March into the Enemies Country, are the veriest Buzzards and
Owls that ever were hatch'd. Unless they are bewitch'd, as We
plainly have been. For I would have thee, and all Men to know,
and thou dost know, that We are neither Owls nor Buzzards.</p>
            <p>I will now tell thee in particular of some of <hi>Luxemburg</hi>'s Tricks:
That thou may'st see what a Rogue he is, and that he is the Rogue
that has bewitch'd us. One of his first Pranks, after he came in
play, was at <hi>Fleury:</hi> where I saw plainly, who he dealt with. He
lay with his Army beyond the <hi>Sambre;</hi> and Prince <hi>Waldeck</hi> was
advancing towards him in fair Order. What does <hi>Luxemburg</hi> now,
but get <hi>Boufflers</hi> to him (by the help of the Devil) with his Army
from a far Country: And Prince <hi>Waldeck</hi> knew no more on't than
the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> In the twinkling of an Eye, abundance of
Bridges were thrown over the River, by the same help I warrant:
And they catch'd poor <hi>Waldeck</hi> in <hi>Fleury</hi> Plains, just as the Devil
had contriv'd it. Would'st know what came on't? They gave us
a damnable Ruffle, to say no worse.</p>
            <p>I come now to <hi>Mons;</hi> which Place we had never lost by a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Siege, but that we were bewitch'd there twice over. First, the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93091:3"/>
Devil was in it, that when we saw vast Preparations for a Siege,
and that in all likelihood <hi>Mons</hi> was aim'd at; we did not put into
it one Man the more, though Thousands lay Quartered in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
So that the Place was lost for want of Men. For the Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was not Five thousand strong, when the Place required Ten
thousand. Secondly, the Town being yet in Condition to hold
out several Days, by <hi>Luxemburg</hi>'s means the Devil possessed the
Priests, and set them in a Mutiny; and they forced the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to surrender. When at the same time we were just Marching
to their Relief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mons</hi> being lost, we fell to fortifying of <hi>Hell;</hi> which thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
is within Seven Miles of <hi>Brussels.</hi> And we had laboured several
Weeks upon it. But <hi>Luxemburg</hi> coming across the Country, we
were fain to out run our new Fortress. For, as the Devil would
have it, there were but Two thousand Men in it, and no Cannon.
We thought the Loss not so great, as the Disgrace and the Baffle.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Luxemburg</hi> could have kept this Town, it had been a sharp
Thorn in our Sides, lying so near <hi>Brussels.</hi> But our Army grew
soon so strong, that he durst not do it. And now he declined
Fighting, and mainly fortified his Camp. Whereupon we fairly
left him, and marched away directly for <hi>France;</hi> to the great Joy
of the whole Army, who long'd to be there. And <hi>Luxemburg</hi> soon
followed; Marching along beside us, and Coasting us at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
We, in our March, were joyn'd by several Thousands; so
that our Army was increased to Ninety thousand Men, the <hi>French</hi>
being not near so many. And now we were full of Hopes, and
Resolution, and Courage; and we hugg'd our selves with the
Thoughts of a brave Invasion. But in the Nick, this cursed Rogue
<hi>Luxemburg,</hi> fell to his Charms and Spells, and confounded all. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
I see the Devil sitting upon his Crump Shoulder, and beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to us, and saying; <hi>Come this way, come this way, turn your Noses
this way.</hi> And as sure as thou art alive, <hi>Tom,</hi> we stop'd our March into
<hi>France,</hi> and turned our Noses upon <hi>Luxemburg.</hi> And we Encamp'd
by him with our mighty Army a good part of the Summer; doing
no kind of Thing but eat up our own Country. Didst thou not
read News in the <hi>Gazette,</hi> Week after Week, <hi>From his Majesties Camp
at</hi> Gemblours, <hi>and from the Royal Camp at</hi> Gemblours? There it was
that we Lay, just behind <hi>Charleroy</hi> and <hi>Namur,</hi> which then were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93091:4"/>
ours; while the <hi>French</hi> Army lay advanced before <hi>Mons.</hi> They
said, we staid for our heavy Cannon to come by Water from
<hi>Mastricht;</hi> which were long a coming. For the Devil dryed up
the <hi>Maese</hi> River, and laid Sands in our way, so that the Boats
could not pass; and we were bewitch'd all over. At last our Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
came up, and we did nothing with them. However we after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
marched on, and passed the <hi>Sambre.</hi> But we never got Ten
Miles beyond it, nor out of our own Contribution: Nor could
we ever reach the <hi>French</hi> Quarters; though they lay as open to us,
as <hi>Hartfordshire</hi> does to <hi>Middlesex.</hi> For then they had no Lines
thereabouts. But our stay was not long in these Parts: For within
a while we Marched back into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Luxemburg</hi> after us;
where we passed the rest of the Campaigne.</p>
            <p>All this while our Noble King was with us; who is the bravest
General in Christendom. He spares for no Pains, and he wants no
Brains, and he is Metal to the Back. <hi>Tom,</hi> it would do thee good
to serve under such a General. But, at the end of the Year, his
Majesty left us, and Prince <hi>Waldeck</hi> commanded. And then it
was that <hi>Luxemburg</hi> play'd us another Trick, near a Town called
<hi>Leuze,</hi> in a damn'd thick Fogg, which the Devil had raised for him;
he was with us, and upon us, before we were in the least aware of
him. I tell thee, <hi>Tom,</hi> we dreamed not on him, till he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
within Pistol shot. And if we had not fought like Devils,
<hi>Luxemburg</hi>'s Devil had beaten us to pieces. But fighting as we did,
it proved but a Brush, or a Basting. Here the Devil did as much
for <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> as could be expected at his hands. For he raised
one Mist in the Air, and cast another over Some-body's Brains:
Or else we should have had our Scouts abroad, knowing that the
Enemy was not far from us.</p>
            <p>The Siege of <hi>Namur</hi> follows next in Order: Where we were
bewitch'd most confoundedly. It was a brave Town, and of
mighty Importance; and we brought a brave Army to relieve it;
and our Men were in high Courage, and would have sought Blood
up to the Ears, and were mad to be at it; making no question but
to beat the <hi>French</hi> to dirt. Then, as to Conduct, I say it again,
We have as good as any in the World: But yet we suffered this
Town to be taken before our Faces, without striking a Stroke; or
so much as firing a Musquet. And some think, That we lost more
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93091:4"/>
Men by lying still, and by the Diseases it occasioned, than we
should have done if we had fought every Day. Now can any Man
imagine that these Things could be, if the Devil had not bewitch'd
us? If the Relief was possible, why did we not attempt it? If it
was impossible, why did we not march away, and make a Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?
But We could neither Fall on, nor March off; but were
perfectly inchanted. And who should do it, but that crooked
<hi>Urchin,</hi> whom I have so often mentioned? The <hi>French</hi> King was
here himself; who is likewise much suspected to deal in the Black
Art. But, for my part, I am fully satisfied, That 'twas <hi>Luxemburg,</hi>
and his Devils, that brought these Things about. It must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
that the <hi>French</hi> did something out-number us; but we feared
them not. And their Army lay round a great City; their inner
Line being without Cannon shot, as it must be: So that their
Quarters extended very wide, and took up a mighty Compass:
Nor had they any Circumvallation, as they called it; only their
Quarters were barricadoed, and some Works thrown up here and
there. Also the <hi>Maes</hi> and the <hi>Sambre</hi> meeting at <hi>Namur,</hi> those two
Rivers run through and divided their Quarters. So that part of
their Men lay on one side the <hi>Sambre,</hi> and part on the other, and
part lay beyond the <hi>Maes.</hi> And we having <hi>Huy</hi> upon the <hi>Maes,</hi>
and <hi>Charleroy</hi> upon the <hi>Sambre,</hi> we might have marched upon them
on either side of either River. And it had been hard, if some
where or other we could not beat them up. However we might
have tryed what we could do: but the Devil was in it, we never
made a tryal. Whereas though we had failed in the Attempt, and
been soundly banged with the Loss of Ten or Twenty thousand
Men; no Body would have blamed us, and our very Loss had
been Glorious. But to be Lookers on, was such a Thing; it
makes me mad to think on it. Though an <hi>Observator</hi> says, That
we got more Honour by our mighty Attempts to relieve the Town,
than the <hi>French</hi> did by taking it.</p>
            <p>But after <hi>Namur</hi> was lost, we fell to fighting like mad; though
it would have been better, one would have thought, to have done
so before. Had we ventured half so freely before, as we did after,
<hi>Namur</hi> might have been Ours at this day. But as to the Fight we
had after, (it is called the Battel of <hi>Steenkirk,</hi> and thou hast heard
much of it) I'll tell thee how it was. The <hi>French</hi> King, after he
had taken <hi>Namur,</hi> was gone to <hi>Paris;</hi> and a good part of his Army
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93091:5"/>
was sent towards <hi>Germany;</hi> and our Army was much increased.
So that the <hi>French</hi> Army, left in <hi>Flanders</hi> with <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> was now
clearly the weaker. Yet, for all that, he had the Impudence to
march into our Country, and there continue. But, for fear of the
worst, he encamped in a Ground of great Advantage, which he
also strongly fortified. Whereupon we took a Resolution to fall
upon him in his Camp. And we begun most bravely. Ten Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions
of Ours, who had the Van, beat Thirty <hi>French</hi> Battalions
out of their Ground; and chased them from Hedg to Hedg, and
from one Work to another; and we made them out-run their
Cannon. We shewed what Rogues we could make of the <hi>French,</hi>
if we had them fairly before us. And now was <hi>Luxemburg</hi> hard
put to it: He scarce had time to say a short Prayer to the Devil.
<hi>Good Devil,</hi> quoth he, <hi>help me out at this dead Lift, or I am undone
for ever.</hi> And the Devil did help him to some purpose. For he
so brought it about, that our Men were not seconded: By which
means we were beaten off with great Loss, (still Fighting stoutly)
and <hi>Luxemburg</hi> scaped a Scouring. For had our main Body secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed
our Van, he had certainly been quite Routed. Some said,
That our main Body could not come up, because of the bad
Ground. But why could they not march the same Way, and
upon the same Ground, that the Van had done? And why did
they not follow closer, but lay Lagging some Miles behind? In
short, The Devil was in it, and we were bewitch'd.</p>
            <p>When this bloody Bout was over; and our Army recruited and
reinforced, we marched to attaque the <hi>French</hi> Lines. But <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
by the help of his old Friend the Devil, got thither before
us. For we, on our part, saunter'd a great way about, and out
of our way, as if <hi>Puck</hi> had led us; which I believe he did. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
we then learned, as we had done at <hi>Hall</hi> before, That the
true way to draw the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> is to march into <hi>France,</hi>
or towards it. For they are very tender in this matter: And
though they love to be in an Enemies Country, yet they cannot
endure that an Enemy should be in theirs.</p>
            <p>Being bob'd at the Lines, we went with our Commanding Army
and encampt at at a Place called <hi>Grammen;</hi> which is a good snug
Place, within our own Country, and but Five or Six Miles from
<hi>Gaunt.</hi> And here we were tyed by the Leg (no doubt by Sorcery
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93091:5"/>
and Witchcraft, it could be nothing else) for a great many
Weeks; being not able to move one way or other. But our Army
increased to a Hundred thousand Men, while <hi>Luxemburg</hi> had not
half the Number; a great part of his Army being gon to the <hi>Maes</hi>
under <hi>Boufflers,</hi> to stave off an Invasion there. Nevertheless we
still kept close in our Camp at <hi>Grammen:</hi> Nor did we budg from
it till we went into Winter Quarters. During all which time you
had News in the <hi>Gazette, From the Royal Camp at</hi> Grammen.</p>
            <p>But what could we have done, had we been disposed to be
active? I answer, That in the first Place we might still have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
their Lines. Not their Line between the <hi>Scheld</hi> and the
<hi>Lys,</hi> where <hi>Luxemburg</hi> lay with his Army; but their long Line be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Lys</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> For this had but an ordinary Guard:
And if the <hi>French</hi> should have drawn their main Army to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
it, their new and unfinished Fortifications at <hi>Courtray,</hi> and
likewise their Camp near it, would have been in great danger.
We found afterward, by Experience, that in all likelihood it
would have been no hard Matter to have sorced these Lines. But
if it had prov'd hard, and we had been repulsed, we might have
marched up the <hi>Scheld;</hi> and have endeavoured, by throwing
Bridges over it, to have gotten that way into the <hi>French</hi> Conquests.
<hi>Tom,</hi> I think in my Conscience this River <hi>Scheld</hi> is enchanted. It
is like <hi>Styx,</hi> the River of Hell; which none could pass without the
help of old <hi>Charon.</hi> Thou knowest it is but a paltry River, in
comparison of other Rivers. A Man (I had almost said) may
leap over it with a Pike Staff: I am sure that with Five or Six
Boats, we might lay a Bridge over it any where. And yet we
stand in as much awe of it, as if it were the <hi>Rhine,</hi> or the <hi>Danube;</hi>
we dare not so much as attempt to pass it. Though the <hi>French</hi>
Conquests lie entire and untoucht behind it; at which we might
have our Wills, if we durst pass this River. If we must Encamp,
why might we not have Encampt upon this River (getting like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a Passage over it) any where above their Lines? And then
the <hi>French</hi> must quit their Lines, we being behind them. Or if we
had made a new Garison, methinks there were the Place. A
lusty Garison here, (I would not have it less than Ten thousand
Men) would maintain it self bravely, by Contributions out of the
<hi>French</hi> Conquests. In such a Garison I should desire to be; there
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93091:6"/>
were some Cut in such a Garison. But suppose we could not get
over this River; must we then lie in our own Country with our
Commanding Army? There was no such Necessity. For we might
have gone higher up the <hi>Scheld;</hi> and have forced those Lines, (if
they had then any Lines there) which afterwards Count <hi>Thian</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
so easily, with a Party of Twelve hundred Men. Which being
done, nothing could have hinder'd us from Marching into <hi>France,</hi>
we having such a mighty Power as we had. And if <hi>Luxemburg</hi> had
come in our way, we should have beaten him, with all his Devils.
But let us go on.</p>
            <p>Thou hast heard, I know, That <hi>Dixmude</hi> and <hi>Furnes,</hi> which
we had fortified at the end of the Campagne, were most famously
lost this Winter. We out-run the one, and the other was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
up after a Siege of some Hours. When these Things were
done, <hi>Luxemburg</hi> was at <hi>Paris:</hi> But I warrant he had laid his Spells
before he went; for I am very sure he did bewitch us. Was it not
a bewitched Thing, that we should fortily these Places for the
<hi>French?</hi> When base Things are done, and no body in Fault, I
conclude there is Witchcraft in the Case: And when no body is
Punish'd, I conclude that no body was in Fault. We were much
troubled at the Loss of these Places: But some think, That we were
more bewitch'd in Fortifying them, than we were in Losing them.
<hi>Furnes</hi> is about Five Miles forward from <hi>Newport,</hi> (which is Ours;)
and <hi>Dixmude</hi> about Seven sideward. And must we have a Garison
at every Seven Miles end? Why, a small Country, thus Garison'd,
would drink up a great Army. And thou knowest, <hi>Tom,</hi> (for
thou art a cunning Dog, and hast Guts i'thy Brains,) that when
we fortify Places near our own Garisons, they do us little good if
we keep them, and great Mischief if the Enemy take them. If we
had kept these Two Places, they would not have commanded a
Contribution (more than we had before) to maintain a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Men; when at least Five or Six thousand must be in them.
I'll not give a Pin for a Garison, that has not a good Contribution.
For the great End of Garisons, let them say what they will, is to
command Contributions. Therefore our new Garisons should
have been made Twenty or Thirty Miles forward, towards the
Enemies Country; and then they would have Contribution in
abundance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:93091:6"/>
Now follows the Campagne of 93. in the Beginning of which
the <hi>French</hi> Monarch was soundly baffled. At that Season, it seems,
the Devil was turn'd against him, or at least forsook him. He
came upon us with a greater Force than ever; and we were to be
run down forthwith, and all <hi>Flanders</hi> to be swallowed up. In
good earnest, <hi>Tom,</hi> we were in great danger. But our King En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd
so commodiously, and so strongly, and took such Order
for the Defence of all Places, that the Monarch was quite gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd.
Yet if he had not been an arrant Buzzard, or the Devil
had not owed him a Shame, he might have left us in our Camp,
and have marched up to <hi>Brussels,</hi> and beyond it, and whither he
pleas'd; and have grazed up the Country as he went, and have
put all <hi>Brabant</hi> under Contribution. Which had put us in a bad
Condition to maintain the War: And some Places or other would
have fallen into his hands. But instead of doing this, or any
Thing else, he sneak'd back to <hi>Paris,</hi> (or to <hi>Versailles,</hi> I care not
which) and all his Court Ladies with him: Whom he had brought
to be Spectators of his famous Victories; and by Report they were
no better than they should be. Soon after the <hi>Dauphin</hi> marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Germany,</hi> with part of the <hi>French</hi> Army: <hi>Luxemburg</hi> being
left with the remaining Part, which was still a Force superiour to
Ours. And not long after that, the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd
from our Army to attaque the <hi>French</hi> Lines. Which Design
was carried so secretly, that the Devil himself could not discover it
to <hi>Luxemburg.</hi> The Lines were master'd with little ado, and we
got into brave Quarters, and we raised Contributions amain. But
then came the Battel of <hi>Landen,</hi> (another bloody Bout,) which hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
us back to our main Army that wanted us. 'Till then we had
been free from Witchcraft during that Campaigne: But then <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburg</hi>
bestir'd himself, and conjur'd up all his Devils; and we
were bewitch'd over and over. First, The Devil bewitch'd us to
let <hi>Huy</hi> be so miserably unprovided for defence, the Enemy being
so near it. And if we could not defend it, why did we not blow
it up? But it was yielded in two or three Days. Secondly, We
were bewitch'd to lie in the Enemies reach, who so much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd
us. And thirdly, We were catch'd in a bewitched Ground;
having a River and Morass behind us, which should have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us. The <hi>French</hi> came up with us over Night; and we expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Retreat that Night, which the Gallants thought dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
But some of our Troop have read Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:93091:7"/>
and they tell us that he has a Saying, <hi>That 'tis more honourable to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
by Night, than to be Beaten by Day.</hi> But we fought it stoutly;
and the King did bravely above the rest. However it was a bad
Business: And it would have been much worse, if <hi>Luxemburg</hi> (to
our great good Fortune) had not play'd the Beast, in not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
his Advantage.</p>
            <p>We are come at last to <hi>Ninety four,</hi> or the Campaigne of last
Summer: And thou wilt find by the Story, That the Devil doth
still haunt us, and bewitch us. This Year the <hi>Dauphin</hi> did again
Command the <hi>French</hi> in Chief; and the old Magician (thou
knowest who I mean) Commanded again under him. And they
presently fell to their old Trade: For the first Thing they did,
was to come boring into our Country, where they lay at Rack
and Manger. And we suffered this as tamely as we used to do:
Wherein thou may'st perceive a Spice of the old Witchery. I
confess that the <hi>French</hi> at first were something too strong for us:
But in a short time we were grown stronger than they; and our
Fingers itched to be upon their Jackets. However we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to forbear, till the Arrival of all our Forces: Which Forces
being come, and we being all together, the Sun never shined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a braver Army. And then we out-number'd the Enemy, by
many Thousands, both in Horse and Foot; and we had better
Horses, and better Men, and were every way superiour: So that
we made no more of the <hi>French</hi> Army, than of so many Jack-daws.
We being in this glorious Condition, the <hi>French,</hi> who had lain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
us, then marched in quite beyond us; and were got between
<hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Mastricht.</hi> But we thought them besotted, to give us
such an Advantage; making account that we had them then in
a Bag (if we had but the Grace to shut it,) and that they could
not escape us. For our Army interposing between them and home,
(as we expected we should) and they having with them all their
Baggage and heavy Cannon, they could not get off without fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and then we made no doubt but we should beat them to fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
For my part, I thought the War was near an End; a happy
and glorious End: There being but two Things to do; that is, to
beat the <hi>French</hi> Army, and then to march to <hi>Paris.</hi> Thou knowest,
<hi>Tom,</hi> That <hi>Namur,</hi> and <hi>Huy,</hi> and <hi>Liege,</hi> and <hi>Mastricht,</hi> lie all on a
Row upon the <hi>Maese.</hi> Of which <hi>Mastricht</hi> and <hi>Liege</hi> were ours,
and the <hi>French</hi> had <hi>Huy</hi> and <hi>Namur: Huy</hi> being advanced into our
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93091:7"/>
Quarters, beyond all the rest of their Frontier. These Places
lying thus, and the <hi>French</hi> Army (as I told thee) being between
<hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Mastricht,</hi> we had Orders given us to get ready to March.
And I cannot express, nor thou imagine, how joyfully we received
these Orders. And then our Business was, either to march straight
upon the Enemy, or to cut off their Retreat, by interposing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and home; that is, between them and <hi>Huy:</hi> For if
they got to <hi>Huy,</hi> they got home. But now see and wonder how
we were Enchanted: <hi>Tom,</hi> as I hope to be saved, we turn'd our
Noses the wrong way again. For with mighty diligence we mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
clear fromward the Enemy, and likewise beside and beyond
<hi>Huy:</hi> leaving the <hi>French</hi> a free Passage to it. And they marched
thither the very next day. Never talk now of Bungling, or Fum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
or making Blunders; for we scorn those Words. 'Twas
Witchcraft, dear <hi>Tom,</hi> 'twas Witchcraft, that made us do as we
did; the Devil and <hi>Luxemburg</hi> did bewitch us: And that damn'd
Magician may brag of this, as one of his bravest-Feats. Thou wilt
say, That we were still between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Namur.</hi> Ay, and
so we were. But the <hi>French</hi> had a Bridge at <hi>Huy</hi> over the River,
and they made divers other Bridges: Whereas we had none, nor
did we offer to make any. So that they could march to <hi>Namur</hi> on
the far side the River, when they pleas'd, without the least danger
or disturbance. But they chose rather to lie by it, that they might
give us a Baffle by making us rise first: Wherein they succeeded, as
well they might. For they Commanded the one side of the River
as much as we; and the other side they had wholy to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>Yet here we staid and encamp'd, as long as we could get any
Forage, waiting upon the French-mens Back sides; (when thou
and I are together, we use another Word.) But, for my part, I
did not think we had owed them that Duty; nor did I know why,
or wherefore we staid here so long, in the high Condition we were
in. The <hi>French,</hi> being the weaker, might with reason be willing
that the time should be spent in idle Encampments: But we, who
were the stronger, if we had not been still bewitch'd, methinks
should rather have chosen to be doing. Well, at last we marched
away for <hi>Flanders,</hi> as hard as we could drive, to have another bout
at those Lines. And the <hi>French</hi> durst not follow us the way we
went, (which was the next way,) for fear we should turn back
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93091:8"/>
upon them, and fall upon their Bones; but they were fain to go
round by <hi>Namur,</hi> and beyond the <hi>Sambre.</hi> Yet, by the Devil's
help, (for no power of Man could do it) they got before us to
the Lines: By which means we were prevented and baffled.</p>
            <p>What had we then to do, with our glorious Army, but to march
presently up the <hi>Scheld;</hi> and either force a Passage over that River,
or march on directly for <hi>France</hi> it self? We had then led the <hi>French</hi>
such a Dance, who were damnably jaded by their late long March,
and hardly able to crawl,) that all the Devils in Hell could not
have enabled them to follow us. But the Devil turn'd our Noses
once more the wrong way: For we marched down the River,
and into our own Country; first to <hi>Oudenard,</hi> then almost to
<hi>Gaunt,</hi> and at last to a Place called <hi>Rousselaer,</hi> which now bears the
Name of a Royal Camp. For here was another Encampment,
and Enchantment: And here we lay with our glorious Army all the
rest of the Summer, as it were bound Hand and Foot; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doing any Thing, or any prospect of it. For we were coop'd
up by the Enemies Lines, which we had no Thoughts of Attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
And was not this a bewitched Place, for such an Army to
lie in? We exceeded the Enemy by Thirty or Forty thousand:
And though after a while we sent a Detachment to the Siege of
<hi>Huy,</hi> yet still we far exceeded them. If we had Encamp'd all this
while in the Enemies Country, it would never have anger'd me,
though we had been never so idle: For then, if we had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, we had eaten up the Enemies Country. I have told
thee already, and I tell thee again, that we were not then in the
Enemies Country. In the Country between both, I confess, we
were: But in these parts, the Enemies Country is that within their
Lines; whereas our Camp was without these Lines, and Eight or
Nine Miles short of them.</p>
            <p>I said before, that we had never attempted <hi>Scheld</hi> River, but I
lyed; we attempted it then, that is, we look'd upon it and no
more. First, one great Man view'd the P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ace, and then another
great Man view'd it, and then we came away. It was as we came
down to <hi>Oudenard,</hi> in ou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> way to ou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Camp: And the Attempt
was made by a Detachment of about Six thousand Men. But if we
had <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>een in earnest, we might have made, out of our vast Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
many such Detachments for that Service: And we might
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93091:8"/>
have attempted several Places at once; or tryed one Place, and
then another; both by Day and by Night. How did Prince <hi>Lewis</hi>
of <hi>Baden</hi> pass the <hi>Rhine</hi> this Summer? I am sure I saw it in the
<hi>Paris Gazette,</hi> (for <hi>Tom</hi> I can now read <hi>French</hi> a little,) That he
made a false Attaque or Attempt in one Place, and then passed in
another; the <hi>French</hi> having drawn their Forces to the first Place.
But this Attempt of ours (such as it was) was made in one Place
only; and in a Place more likely to be provided for defence, than
any other on the River. For it was at <hi>Pont Esperies,</hi> where the
<hi>French</hi> Line ends, which is between the <hi>Lys</hi> and the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and
where they always had Forts and Guards.</p>
            <p>Our retaking of <hi>Huy</hi> was a very good Business, as Things go:
But I expected that the Army that took it, would have enter'd the
Dutchy of <hi>Lutzenburg,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> now have, and which
lies hard by; and so have broken that Charm that keeps us hitherto
from Entring the Enemies Country. Thou wilt say, They did
enter that Dutchy, for all the News-books said so. Why then all
the News-books lyed; for we never were in that Dutchy, nor out
of the Diocese of <hi>Liege:</hi> For, by their own Story, we lay all the
while between <hi>Navaigne</hi> and <hi>Franchimont,</hi> both which Places are
in this Diocese. And <hi>Navaigne</hi> is upon the <hi>Maes,</hi> almost as low
as <hi>Mastricht.</hi> And therefore I am the more confirmed that some
Witchcraft lies upon us; so that we cannot find the way into the
Enemies Country.</p>
            <p>In the close of the last Campaigne (for at last I draw to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion)
we new fortified several Places: That is, <hi>Dixmude</hi> again,
(which the <hi>French</hi> had slighted and abandon'd,) <hi>Deynse, Ninove,</hi>
and <hi>Tillemont;</hi> and we talk of <hi>Hall</hi> likewise. Of these, <hi>Dixmude</hi> (as
I said before) is Seven Miles from <hi>Newport; Deynse</hi> is within Five
Miles of <hi>Gaunt; Ninove</hi> lies behind <hi>Oudenard</hi> and <hi>Aeth; Tillemont</hi> is
between <hi>Lovain</hi> and <hi>Leeuwe,</hi> and very near the later; and <hi>Hall</hi> is
within Six or Seven Miles of <hi>Brussels.</hi> And the Places to which
they <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie thus near, were our standing Garisons before. Let us now
examine between thee and me, and according to our Rules, (and
I think we Troopers should understand these Matters as well as
some of them do) whether these new Garisons be good ones, and
will do us any Service. I say then, That if each of these new Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons
can command Contribution to maintain Three or Four
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93091:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thousand, or even Two or Three thousand Men, we must allow
these Garisons to be good ones. But if all these Garisons put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
will not command any Contribution worth the speaking of,
more than we might have without them; then, according to our
Rules, all of them together are not worth a Dog-turd. And we
were bewitch'd, by <hi>Luxemburg</hi> and the Devil, to be at so much
Charge, in fortifying and keeping such useless Things. A little
time will shew what they can do. But if we had made a new
Garison upon the <hi>Scheld,</hi> any where between <hi>Tournay</hi> and <hi>Conde,</hi>
and another upon the <hi>Sambre</hi> near <hi>Charleroy,</hi> either above or below
it; I'd have eaten Hay with a Horse, and been hang'd for a Fool,
if either of these two Garisons would not have maintain'd Ten
thousand Men: If they were made big enough (as they ought) to
contain so many. And all this by Contributions out of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

never so many Millions from <hi>England,</hi> we shall do nothing here in
<hi>Flanders</hi> that is worth one Farthing. And so, dear <hi>Tom,</hi> fare thee
well.</p>
