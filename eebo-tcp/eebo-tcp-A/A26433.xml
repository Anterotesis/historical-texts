         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ADVERTISEMENT
From their MAJESTIES
General POST-OFFICE,
LONDON,</head>
            <p>IT being Notorious, that many ill-minded Perſons, for ſome wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
againſt the Government, have diſperſed in Coffee-Houſes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
publick Places of Meeting, divers moſt infamous Scandals of their
Majeſties <hi>General Poſt-Office;</hi> giving out, that Letters are there ſtopped, broke
open, and deſtroyed at pleaſure: And eſpecially, that great Numbers of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
about Elections of Members for the next Parliament, have been burnt.</p>
            <p>For the Suppreſſing of ſuch malicious Falſhoods and wicked Inſinuations,
which in conſequence reflect on their Majeſties Juſt and Gracious Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and tend to leſſen their Revenue from the ſaid Office: It is hereby
Notified, that every good and honeſt minded Perſon may eaſily be ſatisfied
by the Oaths of near twenty Officers in the ſaid Office, that the aforeſaid
Reports are utterly falſe, and maliciouſly groundleſs; and that no Letters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſaid occaſion of Election, or at any other time have been deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
open'd or ſtay'd in this Office, and it may be alſo made manifeſt to
them, that ſuch opening of Letters as is falſly rumour'd and pretended, is
wholly impracticable in the ſaid Office, if there were ſo vile a mind in the
Maſter of the ſame, in regard the Letters paſs not his hands, and the
time from the Receipt of the ſame to the Poſts going, is not in any kind
ſufficient for ſuch a foul and villanous Practice.</p>
            <p>It is therefore heartily intreated of all that have reſpect to Truth and
Juſtice, that in love to the Honour and Reputation of their Majeſties Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and to Juſtice it ſelf, they would deſire every one whom they
ſhall hear telling and diſperſing the aforeſaid Scandals upon the ſaid Office,
to diſcover the Authors and Inventers of the ſame: And if any can be found
who have the bold Malice to affirm any of the aforeſaid Falſhoods, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Maſter of the ſaid Office, or any other Officers thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing,
he or they reporting the ſame, ſhall be put upon the Juſtification
thereof in the due Courſe of the Law, or otherwiſe to Pay ſuch Damages
as ſhall be judg'd anſwerable to their odious Offence.</p>
