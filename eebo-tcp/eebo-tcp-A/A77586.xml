         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

may elſewhere find gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
enough to exſpatiate
in) but inſtruct the
ignorant. I have
not taken much care in
quoting Authors, (to ſome
of whom I have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding)
intending thou
ſhouldſt rather be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by Reaſon then Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
and this I did,
<hi>ex induſtriâ,</hi> on ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe,
preferring the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
<pb facs="tcp:169920:6"/>
of Truth before the
Honor of Allegation.</p>
            <p>I deſire likewiſe, that
notice may be taken, that
what I have written, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Health; other Rules
there are in Diſeaſes to be
obſerved, particular, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Nature, and
with reference to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
Augmentation,
State, and Declination of
each diſeaſe, in which
each one muſt expect
advice from his Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian.</p>
            <p>This Part of Phyſick
thou mayſt ſimply and
ſafely known: In the reſt,
unleſs thou beeſt skilful in
<pb facs="tcp:169920:6"/>
all, and with ſome exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
'tis better thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
Ignorant which
thou canſt not be, if thou
haſt any other employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
conſidering the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of time neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
required, before 'tis
poſsible to attain thoſe
many particulars that are
hard to be learnt, and yet
of neceſsity to be known,
before thou canſt without
extreameſt hazzard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the practiſe of
Phyſick: With a Smat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
and Imperfect
Knowledge, thou mayſt be
<hi>bold</hi> (as moſt are) but not
<hi>skilful.</hi> To the firſt <hi>gain</hi>
and <hi>Pride</hi> may prompt;
<pb facs="tcp:169920:7"/>
but to a true Phyſician, ſee
by that which follows what
is Neceſſary.</p>
            <p>It is expedient thou
ſhouldſt firſt know where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
man is made: his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Compoſition, his
due Temperament, as he
is, intire, and of every
part: Their deviations
likewiſe and diverſities;
The Nature of Spirits, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Heat, and Radicall
Moiſture. The Conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Situation, and uſe
of all and every part of
the Body, both Similar and
Organical, the ſeveral
Veſſels, Rivulets, and
Conveyances within us;
and this is only attainable
<pb facs="tcp:169920:7"/>
by frequent diſſection and
Inſpection. Thou art alſo
to know the Operations of
the Soul, as it is diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in, and makes uſe of
ſeveral parts of the Body:
whether they be Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
Generative, Vital,
Animal Senſitive, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
            <p>The particulars contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Diaetetical
part, thou haſt in this
Treatiſe: Thou art like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to have exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of all diſeaſes of the
whole Body, and of every
Part: Their Nature,
Cauſes, Differences, Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
or concomitant Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
and Signs, as well
<pb facs="tcp:169920:8"/>
to know them by, as alſo
to fore-know their iſſues
and events; Their uſual
Mutations, Duplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſudden and many
times frightful Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
which will diſtract
the Practitioner, who to
ſave his credit will then
alſo venter, but with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameſt
danger to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.
But above all, and
that which is moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
is right knowledge of
the manner and method
of Curing: which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
all the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Phyſick and Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which are exceeding
numerous, and require a
large Diſcourſe, but to
<pb facs="tcp:169920:8"/>
reckon up and explain.
And as one requiſite here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
thou oughteſt to be
furniſhed with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of all Plants and
Trees, (at leaſt that are in
uſe in Phyſick) Their
Roots, Stems, Barks,
Leaves, Flowers, Berries,
Fruits, Seeds, excreſences;
to know all Forraign
Drugs, Gums, Rozens,
juyces liquid and inſpiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
all medicinal Animals,
their parts and Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
Whatſoever the
Sea affords for Medecine:
or the bowels of the Earth,
as Mettals and Minerals.
All theſe ought well to be
known, both how to chooſe
<pb facs="tcp:169920:9"/>
them, to prepare, mix and
compound them. To make
of them diſtilled Waters,
Simple and Compound:
Conſerves, Syrups, Loches,
Powders, Electuaries,
Pills, Trochisks, Diet
Drinks, Apozems, Potions
of all ſorts, proper to each
body, part, diſeaſe: Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
Iuleps, Ptiſans, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piats,
Epithems, Lotions,
Fomentations, Baths,
Liniments, Oyntments,
Cataplaſmes, Cerats,
Plaiſters, Veſicatories,
Colliries for the Eyes,
Caps for the Head, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gariſmes
for the Mouth
and Throat, Dentifrices
for the Teeth, Errhina for
<pb facs="tcp:169920:9"/>
the Noſe: Sneezing-powders,
Suffiments,
Peſſaries, Suppoſitories,
Clyſters and Injections.
Theſe of diverſe kinds,
with many more, which
for brevity ſake I omit, a
Phyſician ought to be well
ſeen in, and acquainted
with; but principally to
know the proper time, and
ſeaſon of uſing them;
which is not to be done, but
with much ſtudy, educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
therein, great helps
and experience; and yet
without that, all Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
though in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
as the hand of God to
cure diſeaſes, prove like
<pb facs="tcp:169920:10"/>
a ſword in a mad mans
hand, by which inſtead of
doing the Phyſicians work,
Work is made for the
Phyſician.</p>
            <p>I intend not by this
to affright any from the
acquiſition of the Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Art: but rather to
let the World ſee, what
is requiſite thereunto, that
it may underſtand how far
ſhort of being Phyſicians
ſuch men are, who upon
the bare ſtock of a few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts,
and knowing how
churliſhly to Purge and
Vomit, with three or four
more common Operations
in Phyſick, preſently and
with confidence fall to
<pb facs="tcp:169920:10"/>
the practiſe therefore: As
if a man ſhould boaſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a good Painter, becauſe
he knows how to mix
Colours, but knows not
what belongs to Symmetry
and Proportion.</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Sed quo non mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia
pectora cogit,</l>
               <l>Auri Sacra Fames—</l>
            </q>
            <p>It were better their need
or Avarice did prompt
them to venter upon ſome
other ſubject then the
body of man. Thus much
I thought good to inſert in
this place, to ſhew the
difference between what is
requiſite to the preſerving
<pb facs="tcp:169920:11"/>
preſerving thy Health,
and reſtoring it; The
firſt is properly thy own
work, the laſt is the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
unleſs thou giveſt
thy time to make thy ſelf
ſuch.</p>
            <p>But to return from
whence I doubt I have too
long digreſſed; They who
reſolve to continue their
courſe of life without care
or conſideration of their
Health guided by their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
and not their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings,
will receive
little or no benefit by this
Treatiſe: however <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravi
animam meam,</hi> I
have done my duty, and
therein receive ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb facs="tcp:169920:11"/>
Others who are more
careful of themſelves
will, I queſtion not, hence
gain ſome light and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
to whom I offer this,
but not impoſe it; prefer
it in my own underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as beſt, but ſubmit it
to theirs; and wiſh them
to be perſwaded, as the
reaſon thereof proves effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious:
all that I deſire is,
that they would not be
prejudiced by Cuſtom, and
long received opinion w<hi rend="sub">ch</hi>
in ſome places it thwarts:
but preſeinding from that,
give their underſtandings
leave clearly to examine,
and ſo judge and Practiſe.
<pb facs="tcp:169920:12"/>
It is like my attempt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
may ſet others at work;
I ſhall be glad of that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
and of whatſoever elſe
may tend to the Helath
and Commodity of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>

            <head>A Conſervatory of
HEALTH.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is as much
the Duty of a
Phyſitian to
endeavour the
<hi>Preſerving</hi> of <hi>Health,</hi> as
the reſtoring it: and ſo
much the more carefull
he ought to be, by how
much the more neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectfull
People are of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:169920:18"/>
themſelves: This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a charge that we
are not ſo much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to by <hi>Gain,</hi> as by
<hi>Conſcience;</hi> For there
are few or none that
come to the Phyſitian
to keep themſelves wel,
but only when they are
forc't thither by the
importunity of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
It becomes us
therefore who have the
Charge of Bodies, to
ſend our Councell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and though that
may be a means to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
our Practice, yet
will it much quiet our
Minds in the diſcharge
of a neceſſary part of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169920:18"/>
our duty; It is much
eaſier to prevent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
then expell them,
It may be done with
ſmall care, and leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence;
our Diſeaſes coſt
us dear, not only in the
Cure, but in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe,
being for the
moſt part the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprings
of Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
Incontinency,
Diſorder, and other
very coſtly Vices.
Temperance therefore
brings a double Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
with it: the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
of Health, and
the Saving of Expence,
all which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
ſo indulgent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169920:19"/>
is the generality of
Mankind, to their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
and the preſent
enjoyment of their
looſe and inordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
that they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
caſt off the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of events and
conſequences, never du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prizing Health till
they have loſt it: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
a ſickly, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
and momentany
Delight before a full,
perfectly contentfull, &amp;
durable. A cuſtomary
ſaying they have, <hi>That
he lives miſerably, who
lives Phyſically;</hi> and
that they who obſerve
Rules, look paleſt, are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169920:19"/>
moſt frequently ſick,
and in Phyſick, of Lean
and conſumed Bodies:
whereas the good Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that regards not
what he eats, or how
much he drinks, is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
plump and Ruddy,
ſeldome ſick, &amp; though
happily they live not ſo
long, yet are their
lives more pleaſurable,
which makes good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
for the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
For better is a
ſhort life and Happy,
then a long and Dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous:
And therefore let
us, ſay they, give the
Reins to our Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
let us looſe no
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169920:20"/>
time: Let us eat and
drink, and if we die to
morrow, let us have our
penny worths out to
day; For to what end
are all delicious things
given us, if not to enjoy?
Thus pleads the Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate:
As if he were
born for his Belly, and
all the noble Faculties
of his Soul, the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
operations of his
Senſes, and other Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliments
of his Body
ought to be ſubſervient
thereunto, As if he
lived to Eat, and did
not eat to Live: making
that the main end of
his Creation, which is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169920:20"/>
but an unavoidable
Conſequent, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Neceſſity for
Preſervation: Eating
and drinking, and other
ſenſuall pleaſures, are
indeed below the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Soul; In
which Beaſts are our
Equals, and for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to furniſh us
with parts of exacteſt
Senſe, for the incitation
of Deſire and Appetite,
leaſt otherwiſe wee
ſhould neglect thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
needfull for
preſerving the Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall
and Kind, out of a
contempt to the Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169920:21"/>
of the Works
themſleves, or out of a
more earneſt intention,
upon more excellent &amp;
worthy Actions. But
beſides all this, They
conſider not thoſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Headaches, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhes,
Qualms, Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings,
Swimmings in
the Head, Dimneſs in
the Eys, fluſhing Heats,
Dropſies, Gouts, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
and other more
irkſome and ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Diſeaſes, they that
indulge their Appetites
and Deſires are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
withall: beſides
the decay of Memory,
ſlackneſs of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169920:21"/>
loſs of Time,
and Reputation: All
which God Almighty,
both to deterr and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh

inſeparable Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of Intemperance
and Incontinency; that
whom the foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

Recompence, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
Reclaim.</p>
            <p>Others there are, who
avoiding the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of thoſe Vices,
Pride themſelvs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and think they are
carefull enough, and
do in that as much as is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169920:22"/>
needfull for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Health. Theſe
are affrighted with the
variety and multiplicity
of Rules and Cautions,
which they ſay Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
have purpoſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
to make their
very Healths Tributary
unto them; that ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſity
in Diet and

too intent thereupon,
and hinders the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

To theſe I ſhall ſay,

ſwerved, and thereupon
faln into many ſtrange

which except in
Countries of equall Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury
and Intemperance
with our own, are not
to this day ſo much as
heard of. Mine ſhall
not be Rules of Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

no burdens or Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

Rules of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,

in our Lives, by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
whereof Life
may be prolonged, and
Diſeaſes avoided: The
Benefits of this Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
I ſhall not need to

in two excellent

both which are almoſt

            <p>That therefore I may

may we conclude, that
though Sickneſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169920:25"/>
doth not: and that the
Neutrall Conſtitution,

In this ſenſe a

found, every one having

Yet is it oppugned by
many Arguments, As
1. Children &amp; Youths,
of Nature Hot, are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
Wine; and with
old men that are cold
of Temperament do
hot things beſt agree;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:169920:29"/>
Hence ſay we, <hi>Vinum
eſt Lac Senum,</hi> Wine is
the old Mans Milk; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to which is
that of <hi>Hippocrates, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demiôn</hi> 6<hi rend="sup">to</hi>.
They that
are Cholerick muſt uſe
bathing, and much reſt:
they muſt drink Water
for Wine; Muſtard,
Garlick, Leekes, Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and ſpiced Meats
are to ſuch very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
This is confirmed
by every daies experi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence;
Therefore ought
that Traditionall Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
in Phyſick to be
no longer truſted to,
being ſo detrimentall to
our Healths.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:169920:30"/>
For the Deciſion of
the Queſtion, we muſt
Note, 1. That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
to be given,
ought to be in caſes of
Health &amp; Sound Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
and not of
Diſtemper and Sicknes,
for then the other part
of the Maxime takes
place, <hi>That they are to
be helped by Contraries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Note.</hi> That the
Aſſimilation is not to be
underſtood in a large
Senſe, but ſtrictly, with
reference, not to the
Quality in generall, but
to the proper and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall
degree thereof:
As for Inſtance, The
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169920:30"/>
true Temperament of
Man is, when all the
Qualities pertinent to
his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Compoſition are
well mixt and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
only his Heat and
Moiſture are ſomewhat
predominant, it is now
therefore to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by ſuch things as
are of like Temper and
Qualification; Hence
muſt we not infer, that
whatſoever is Hot,
though in never ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe
a degree, is proper
and nutritive, but that
which is ſo in the ſame
degree and conſtitution
with himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thoſe things are
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169920:31"/>
truly ſaid to be alike in
Temperament, which
are of equal diſtance
from the Mean: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
thoſe things
which are hot in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
degree, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by Aliments of
the ſame degree: but
thoſe which have much
departed from the due
Temperament, ought
not to be preſerved in
the State they are in,
but by due Alteratives
and Correctives to be
amended and reſtored.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
I agree with the
Affirmative, That the
Body is beſt preſerved
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169920:31"/>
by Similaries; for how
is Nutrition perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
but by agglu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination
and Aſſimilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by making the food
one and the ſame with
the body: Thoſe things
therefore that have
greateſt Likeneſs and
Reſemblance in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament,
muſt needs
be moſt eaſily and with
leaſt diſturbance to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
aſſimilated, and
made one with her
Self.</p>
                  <p>To the objections I
anſwer, 1. That Wine
is therefore forbidden
children, becauſe its
Heat is in no proportion
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169920:32"/>
analogous to theirs, as
being over-intenſively
hot, and ſo too violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſumptive of that
radicall Moyſture, and
deſtructive to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Heat; which by
meats and drinks of like
Temperament is long
and kindly preſerved.</p>
                  <p>To the 2. I will not
here diſpute how good
Wine is for Old men; I
believe they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
too bold with it:
and my obſervation
tells me that they live
moſt Healthfully, who
both in their youth and
old Age are leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to it: It may
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169920:32"/>
be good Phyſick, but
bad Diet: Help to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
and recompenſe
the Defects of Heat,
and to dry up thoſe
ſuperfluous Moyſtures
with which old men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
but they who
uſe it as their Milk, muſt
expect (in ſtead of Soft
and Firm Fleſh, ſuch as
Milk indeed produces
in Children:) a dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and withering in
theirs, a depraedation of
their ſpirits &amp; ſtrength,
Catarrhes from their
brain, one while upon
their <hi>Lungs,</hi> and then
they become <hi>Phyſical:</hi>
Another while upon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:169920:33"/>
their <hi>Kidnies,</hi> and then
they prove <hi>Nephritical:</hi>
Now the Humors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
and thicken in the
<hi>Brain,</hi> and then they
prove <hi>Lethargicall,</hi> and
<hi>Apoplectical:</hi> in others
they looſen the <hi>Nerves,</hi>
and fall upon the
<hi>Limbs</hi> and <hi>Joynts,</hi> and
then the <hi>Palſy</hi> and <hi>Gout</hi>
ſeizes them. Thus
much as to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>To the objection I ſay,
that the good which
Wine, taken in good
quantity and ſeaſon,
doth to Old Men, it
performs as a Corrector
of the defects, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mender
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:169920:33"/>

and conſumed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
Nature makes no
leaps, but paſſes from
one extream to another
by intervenient Grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
This Rule muſt
carefully be obſerved
by ſuch as having long
accuſtomed themſelves
to that which is hurtful
and prejudicial to their
Healths, have acquired
thereby an Evil Habit
and Conſtitution of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
whether it be by
too much uſe of Wine,

Exerciſe, Meats of

Sleeping after

to Health, muſt not
however either in Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or Health, be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
and all at once
left off, but by degrees,
and ſmall portions, and
the contraries thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
(if need require) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly
introduct, and
inoffenſively to Nature.
Many Inſtances might
be here reckoned up to
ſhew the evils that have
enſued upon ſuch Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
changes, but in a
caſe ſo clear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in
which almoſt every
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169920:36"/>
mans obſervation will
afford him examples,
it will be needleſs:
The inconveniences are
moſt familiarly ſeen in
leaving totally off long
accuſtomed exerciſes,
whereby thoſe Humors
which Motion waſted
by Tranſpiration, being
cloſed in, and heapt up
in the body, become
the Food and Matter of
Diſeaſes. So that here
the Gradation is to be
obſerved, and the Diet
leſſened, that ſo what
by ſtirring before was
uſed to be evaporated,
may now not be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:169920:37"/>
Another Error there
is, of ſuddenly altering
an inveterate Cuſtome
<hi>in Sicknes &amp; Weakneſses,</hi>
although that Cuſtome
hath <hi>no Contrariety with
the Diſeaſe.</hi> By which
means Nature is very
much <hi>diſcomfited and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
her delight being
taken away,</hi> and in that
dejection ſhe yields ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much to the diſeaſe;
ſhe muſt for a time be
indulged, Cuſtome ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
got a great ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and ſympathy
with her ſelf; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
whereof muſt
be left to a time when

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:169920:37"/>
good leaſure, &amp; not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the hands of ſome
violent or obſtinate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.
This caſe is moſt
perſpicuous in thoſe
that drink much Wine,
and take much Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,
which though in
themſelves in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
prejudiciall to
the parties uſing them,
yet by time and long
uſe made familiar with
their Natures, as <hi>Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi>
was to <hi>Galens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian
Woman,</hi> or <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to Mithridates:</hi> they
muſt not when Violent
Diſeaſes come upon
them, be raſhly and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
left off; and the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:169920:38"/>
Cuſtomary longings of
Nature utterly rejected,
conſidering I ſay the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
they have got
with her ſelf, but rather
their quantities fitly
leſſened, and the totall
omiſſion thereof left to
a Time of greater
Strength and Ability.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon hereof
is, becauſe whatſoever
any man is accuſtomed
to, though worſe in its
own Nature, yet is it
leſs hurtfull to him then
its contrary, foraſmuch
as it makes leſs Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and ſo works
leſs diſturbance to the
Stomack and other
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169920:38"/>
parts, becauſe of its A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
in quality

though weak and
Aged better bears <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
then the ſtrongeſt

                  <p>I plead not here for

the beſt way of Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

Inference rather may
be made there-from,
that ſince Evil things

1.<note place="margin">1. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion.</note> In that it ſuffers
not the Stomack to
cloſe, but leaves the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Orifice open; by
which its heat exhales
and ſo languiſhes, &amp; the
inconveniences thence
ariſing are almoſt innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable:

               <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">2. Growth or Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> For <hi>Diſtribution,</hi>
how can that be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

So is Digeſtion perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

that ſince we eat to be

ſure will do, for
why is it that we indulg

Natural</hi> and <hi>unforc't,</hi>
ſuch is the Temperate

2. That Delight is

ſuch is the Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

Whilſt the other, for
his Deliciouſneſs to

diſtracted amidſt his
Pleaſure, by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
of what will
follow: And how can
that be termed delight,
which is intermixt with
an expectation of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
There will bee
Qualms and Surfets, a
neceſſity of frequent
Purgations, Vomitings,
Bleeding, making Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169920:66"/>
And then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Surfets are called
to mind, and repented
of; then we condemn
our ſelves for preferring
a ſickly and momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Pleaſure before a
ſound and laſting: The
Athenians by one of
their Senatours were
told, that they never
Treated of Peace but in

So are we, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs
of a ſober Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
till we are cauteriſed,
and have Cataplaſmes
and Plaiſters about us.
Till then we blame, one

while the Aire, another
while the place we live
in, as unwholſome, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
the fault to our

Country, or ſome ſuch
trifle, but never think of
the true cauſe, our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance.
But I ſhall
not need further to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
this Point, for to
ſuch as have the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of themſelves,
their longings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
here is ſufficient;
Such as have not, will
run their courſe, till
Sickneſs, and an inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

come now to the Thing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:169920:67"/>
it ſelf, The Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Bounds and

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:169920:70"/>
the true cauſe

This, as to the general,

               <p>The particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
for often

ſame, as for much feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<hi>Children</hi> muſt eate

Old men</hi> are to be fed
<hi>like Children,</hi> becauſe
they are not able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
much: But being
not in the extremity of

endure Hunger. The

My Reaſons <hi>for larger

the time after Supper is
fitteſt for Concoction,
as deſtined to Reſt and
Sleep, in which the heat
&amp; Spirits are not diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
or otherwiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
in the Brain or
<hi>limbs,</hi> as in the day time
by Buſineſs or Labor
but are totally retired,
&amp; imployed about Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion.
2. The Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
Space between
Supper and Dinner, is
much larger then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Dinner and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
&amp; the Heat &amp; Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
have thereby the

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:169920:82"/>
to perform

                  <p>The ſtrongeſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
againſt this that
I can find is, in the caſe
of thoſe that are troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

Vertigo, Catarrhs,</hi> or any
other infirmities of a
weak and moiſt Brain.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer,
firſt, that my enquiry
was only of what is
beſt for them that are
in good ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Health, and
that particular Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
require particular
Rules.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſay, as to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
caſe, that the early
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:169920:82"/>
Supping avoids the
inconvenience; for that
a ſufficient ſpace is
allotted before ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

can I but conceive
that Motion and Labor,
which is uſual after
Dinner, doth by Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

inclines to the Elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <p>To the Common Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
of the aſſiſtance
the Stomack finds by
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:169920:83"/>
the additional Heat of
the Sun, for its Help to
Digeſtion. I anſwer,
that all external Heats
are rather a Hinderance
thereunto, then a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance,
for that they
diſſipate, and draw
forth the Natural Heat,
and leave the Inner
parts more Cold and
Helpleſs: This they
ſhall ſoon experiment
that ſit by a great Fire,
or in the Hot Sun after
Meals; and the caſe is
clear by our Stomacks,
greater inability in the
Summer then Winter:
So that my aſſertion to
me remains firm, which

2. <hi>The prevention of the

Phyſician, whoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
it was to take the
profeſſion of a Dying
<hi>Phyſician</hi> in this point.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:169920:118"/>
He was (ſaith he) but
ſimple in manners, and
meanly Learned, but in
his Auguration of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
by Urin, held
moſt excelling, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before the beſt
learned of the Country:
Some ſmall time before
his death, he was for the
behoof of poſterity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned
to leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him that skil in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins,
that had made him
ſo famous; he Replyed,
that it was unworthy
Poſterity, unworthy
the name of Art; That
he had long indeed,
with the felicity of
good opinion, exerciſed
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:169920:119"/>
it, but with tryed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
known it to be
<hi>uncertain and deceit.
Simplicity, he ſaid, was
eaſily ready to betray it
ſelf,</hi> and the ignorant
People; eſpecially to
one uſed to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
will eaſily <hi>diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their hearts in their
Eyes, Geſture and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances,
of themſelves
unobſerved, and unconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered:</hi>
Sometimes I
have predicted right
upon Conceptions, and
that hath ſpread it ſelf,
but I have proved more
often to my own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
falſe, but that
hath ſoon dyed, or
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:169920:119"/>
found excuſe. I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſatisfied my ſelf
in my deceitful cuſtom,
in that I deceived none
but ſuch as either deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
or deſerved it; who
by their <hi>inſidiation</hi> of
the <hi>proof</hi> of my <hi>skill,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
provoked it, or by
<hi>unreaſonable earneſtneſs
extorted it.</hi> Thus, ſome
daies before his death
did this famous Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
unbowel himſelf,
and thereby indeed
made ſomeamends for
his former inpoſtures.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, 'tis moſt <hi>eaſy</hi>
to <hi>deceive the Phyſician</hi>
by other Liquors, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially,
if he <hi>ſmells</hi>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:169920:120"/>
them not: and though
ſome notes of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
are given by <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen</hi>
and others, yet are
they very doubtful, and
not to be truſted to: I
judge it no diſhonor to
be deceived in this
kind, unleſs to ſuch as
arrogate a certainty of
Divination.</p>
               <p>It ſhould be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
alſo, that thou art
ignorantly, &amp; doltiſhly
imploying thy ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
poſing the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
miſpending thy

when in the mean time,
the diſeaſe by delay
gets ſtrength, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
more obſtinate,
Malignant, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture

               <p>I adviſe therefore all
good People, that you
regard not other mens
<hi>fame</hi> fraudulently got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
but your own

you have in the

let the Phyſician then
