            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>OF THE QUALIFICATIONS Required to a Profitable Hearing OF GOD's WORD. A SERMON Preach'd on the Gospel for <hi>Sexagesima</hi>-Sunday, AT GRAYS-INN, 1689.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>LUKE VIII.8.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>He that hath Ears to hear, let him Hear.</p>

            <p>THE Words are a kind of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial</hi> Expression, with which our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> very <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. xi.15 —xiii.9.43. Mat vii.16 Luk. xiv.35, &amp;c.</note> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently concludes his Discourses to his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59924:10"/>
Disciples, the more to engage them to a just Attention to, and Consideration of that holy <hi>Gospel</hi> which he delivered unto them: And the import whereof we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not better learn, than from that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Parable</hi> to which they are here sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> Sower <hi>went out to</hi> sow <hi>his</hi> Seed: <hi>and as he</hi> sowed, <hi>some fell by the</hi> way-side, <hi>and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it: And some fell upon a</hi> Rock, <hi>and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture: And some fell among</hi> Thorns, <hi>and the</hi> Thorns <hi>sprang up with it, and choaked it: And other fell on</hi> good ground, <hi>and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundred-fold: And when he had said these things, he cried,</hi>
               <q>He that hath <hi>Ears</hi> to <hi>hear,</hi> let him <hi>hear.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In which <hi>Parable</hi> our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> sets forth to us the different success which his <hi>Gospel</hi> then did, and would ever after be likely to meet with, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different dispositions of those to whom it was Preach'd.</p>
            <p>It is indeed an uncomfortable Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and, I think I may say one of the greatest discouragements we labour
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59924:10"/>
under, in the discharge of our <hi>Ministry,</hi> to consider how very little benefit, for the most part, all our Endeavours have upon the minds of those to whom we declare the <hi>Gospel of Christ.</hi> That after all we can do,<note place="margin">2 Cor. v.11.</note> either by the <hi>Goodness</hi> or <hi>Terrors of the Lord to perswade men,</hi> yet scarce a <hi>fourth part</hi> brings any <hi>fruit</hi> at all to perfection, and even those too in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry small measure. Some few perhaps there are, who produce a little increase; they <hi>hear</hi> the <hi>word,</hi> and consider their <hi>duty,</hi> and return it <hi>thirty-fold</hi> in Piety and Good works: But for the <hi>sixty,</hi> and the <hi>hundred-fold,</hi> scarce any there are,<note place="margin">Mat. xiii.8.</note> that ever arrive at this pitch, or but give us any great cause to hope, that ever they will come up to it.</p>
            <p>Instead of fruitless Complaints in a matter of so great consequence both to our <hi>Ministry,</hi> and to your <hi>Salvation,</hi> I shall make it my endeavour on this occasion, both for the happier prosecution of my own Duty, and, if it may please God, for the greater benefit of your Souls, plainly to lay before you the cause of this: By resolving it, as both the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Saviour, and the natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the thing its self require I should, into the general indisposition of Men to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59924:11"/>
receive the <hi>Gospel.</hi> We now, as the <hi>Sower</hi> in the <hi>Parable,</hi> scatter the same <hi>Seed</hi> on all the parts of the <hi>Field</hi> indifferently: We desire that every one should yield a suitable increase. What can possibly be the cause of that strange variety we find in the product, that one part should bring forth a plentiful crop of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Good works</hi>; another either none at all, or but a very small one in comparison, but only this, That the <hi>Ground</hi> is in some better prepared to receive the <hi>Seed</hi> than it is in others, and therefore brings forth the <hi>Fruit</hi> accordingly.</p>
            <p>This is the plain design both of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> before mentioned, and of that <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation</hi> with which our Saviour here concludes it in the words of the <hi>Text,</hi>
               <q>He that hath <hi>Ears</hi> to hear, let him <hi>hear.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In my Discourse upon which words, that I may pursue the same <hi>Method</hi> which our <hi>Blessed Lord</hi> did in his Parable, I will</p>
            <p n="1">I. Show you what sort of <hi>Hearers</hi> they are, to whom the <hi>Word</hi> is in vain spoken; who are not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to benefit themselves by our <hi>Preaching.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59924:11"/>II. Will offer some <hi>Rules</hi> for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposing of your <hi>Souls</hi> in such a manner, that by the <hi>Grace</hi> of God you may be fit to receive benefit by it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am to show what kind of <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> they are, to whom the Word is in vain spoken, who are not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to benefit themselves by our <hi>Preaching.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In pursuance of which Point, I should be infinite should I insist particularly on all those indispositions that are apt to render a man an unprofitable <hi>Hearer</hi> of Divine Truth. I will reduce this first sort of <hi>Auditors</hi> to as few <hi>Generals</hi> as I can, and that with all the freedom and plainness, that both the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of such an Undertaking require.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And the first that I shall mention, is, The <hi>Careless Hearer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the misfortune of too many, in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. iii.5.</note> that in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Character, they <hi>have a form of Godliness,</hi> but are little acquainted with the <hi>Power of it.</hi> They come to our Assemblies, and hear our Discourses, and for the time are very much affected with them: But they go away, and presently they forget
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59924:12"/>
what they heard; their Holy Affections are scattered as a morning Cloud, they grow cold and indifferent as they were before; nor much concern themselves with any farther thoughts of Religion, till the next Sunday comes, and another Sermon again puts them in mind of it. As if the end of all our <hi>Preaching</hi> were only to make the Service a little the more solemn; to entertain them an hour extraordinary in the <hi>Church</hi>; and if they did but sit out that, with any tolerable Attention, they had then discharged their duty, they had done all that was required of them.</p>
            <p>To such <hi>Auditors</hi> as these, I would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beg leave to remonstrate how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable such a negligence as this is; and of what a dangerous consequence it will most certainly prove to them in the end. Our Discourses in these Places, all of them I am sure should be, and I believe for the most part are, either <hi>Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of that <hi>Duty</hi> which God requires of us, or <hi>Exhortations</hi> to fulfil it; or else to shew the danger and baseness of those <hi>Temptati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns,</hi> that most usually draw men aside from it. Now all these natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally imply an obligation on the part of those that <hi>hear</hi> us, to do somewhat in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59924:12"/>
pursuance of these instructions: Either to fulfil this <hi>Duty,</hi> or to fly those <hi>sins</hi> that are contrary to it; or to watch and arm themselves against those <hi>Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which they are forewarn'd will other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be apt to seduce them from it. And if they neglect to do this, they will be much more inexcusable, than if they had never been instructed by us: What our Saviour once said of the <hi>Jews</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his <hi>Preaching,</hi> will be found as true now, with respect to ours: <hi>If I had not come and spoken unto them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. xv.22.</note> 
               <hi>they had not had sin; but now they have no cloak for their sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not in discourses of this kind as in other ordinary addresses that are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made to us: which if they do but afford us some agreeable entertainment for the present, we have our desire; and though we afterwards never trouble our selves with any farther thoughts of them, yet we run no great hazard, nor it may be sustain any Loss by our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of them.</p>
            <p>But when we tell you your Duty, and lay before you the Doctrine by which you are to be Saved, the Case is much otherwise. We speak as the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; and as the <hi>Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59924:13"/>
of Christ</hi> we beseech you to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto Him. The words which we deliver unto you, they are not our own, but His that sent us: they are the rules and measures by which you ought to live, and by your neglect or obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance whereof, you must preserve or lose your Souls to all Eternity. The light esteem of what we say, do not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, it reflects not upon us, but on him whose <hi>Ministers</hi> we are; whose <hi>Gospel</hi> we preach, and whose <hi>Goodness</hi> we set forth, and who therefore will one day call you to a severe account for that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regard you now shew of what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver unto you. But</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> A second sort of <hi>Hearers,</hi> who reap but little benefit by all our discourses are, The <hi>Curious Hearers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For such there still are in our days, as well as we read there were heretofore in the <hi>Apostles</hi>; Who hold mens Persons in Admiration, and esteem the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> more according to the <hi>Preachers Eloquence,</hi> than its <hi>own Authority.</hi> One is of <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. i.12.</note> another of <hi>Apollos,</hi> and a third of <hi>Cephas</hi>; As if the business of our Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were to please their Fancies, not to instruct their Minds and to reform their Manners; and that simplicity which was
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59924:13"/>
once the Glory of the <hi>Gospel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">—Ib. ver· 17, 18, 19· and 2 Cor. iv.13.</note> were now to be esteem'd the scandal of its <hi>Ministers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is that so many of our <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> instead of coming to our discourses as they ought, to <hi>hear</hi> their <hi>Duty,</hi> and confirm their <hi>Faith,</hi> and encrease their <hi>Piety,</hi> come rather to <hi>observe,</hi> and <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;</hi> The application they make, is not to enter into their <hi>Closets,</hi> and Meditate upon what they have Heard, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how they may benefit their Souls by it; and then to beg the assistance of <hi>God's Grace</hi> to enable them so to do; But to Applaud or Despise the <hi>Preacher,</hi> according as he has had the Fortune to be liked or disliked by them. There is hardly any defect in the <hi>Preacher</hi> so small, that is not enough to distast them against the very <hi>Doctrine</hi> that is delivered: And be the <hi>Duty</hi> never so clearly and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly established, yet if the <hi>Method</hi> be not exact, the <hi>Style</hi> correct, the <hi>Subject</hi> such as they approve; the <hi>Voice,</hi> the <hi>Action,</hi> nay and sometimes the very <hi>Look</hi> of him that <hi>speaks</hi> to them, agreeable to their Fancies, all is spoiled, and they are not <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas! Who is <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. iv.5.</note> or who is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos,</hi> or who is <hi>Cephas?</hi> Are we not all the Ministers of <hi>Christ, and your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59924:14"/>
for Jesus sake?</hi> Do we not all Preach to you the same common Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Is it not the same <hi>Gospel</hi> that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by every one of us? What if we have not all of us the same accidental ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages? If another speak to you with more Ornament and Eloquence? Must therefore my Weakness, render the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Christ Contemptible?</p>
            <p>I would to God, for your sakes, we were all such as you desire. That we could every one of us not only instruct, but please you too to <hi>Edification</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Cor. ix.22.</note> that so by any means, if it were possible, we might gain some of you. But yet, in the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> give me leave freely to say of this <hi>Curiosity,</hi> That <hi>verily there is a fault among you.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. vi.7.</note> And what wonder if you do not reap that real Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage we could wish from our instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, when alas! it is not That you look after: You come with <hi>curiosity</hi> to <hi>gratify an itching Ear,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. iv.3.</note> not with true <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> to increase your Knowledge, and improve your Piety. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> A third sort of <hi>Hearers</hi> to be considered in this place are, The <hi>Carnal</hi> and <hi>Sensual Hearers</hi>: Men, who in their <hi>wills</hi> and <hi>desires</hi> are utter Enemies to the Practice of <hi>Christianity,</hi> however they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59924:14"/>
sometimes comes to be hearers of it.</p>
            <p>But as the Great <hi>Philosopher</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he opened his <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and began his <hi>Lectures</hi> with the same reflections I am now making, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all vicious and even young men from his <hi>Auditory</hi>;<note place="margin">Aristot. Eth. Nic. lib. 1. c. 1.</note> Esteeming it in vain for him to spend his time in instructing those who were either already engaged in a Course of Sin, or otherwise by the bent and heat of their Age strongly inclined and tempted to it: So may I certainly, with much greater reason, say with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to our <hi>Gospel,</hi> That to such as these, all our <hi>Addresses</hi> will signify but very little. Nor can we reasonably expect men should become such Proficients as we desire, by our exhortations to Piety, till they will begin seriously to dispose their minds to the practice of it.</p>
            <p>To preach to a soft <hi>Voluptuary,</hi> the severe Doctrines of <hi>Mortification,</hi> and <hi>Self-denyal</hi>; to an <hi>Angry</hi> and <hi>Impatient</hi> Spirit, to bear <hi>Injuries,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. xii.17. Mat. v.44. Luke xi.41. — xvi.9.</note> 
               <hi>not to recompence to any Evil for Evil</hi>; to <hi>forgive,</hi> nay, <hi>to love his Enemies:</hi> To the <hi>Covetous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,</hi> to <hi>Give Alms of such things as he has</hi>; and <hi>make himself friends in Heaven,</hi> by the wise distribution of his <hi>unrighteous Mammon</hi> upon <hi>Earth</hi>; what is this but
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59924:15"/>
to <hi>plow the sand:</hi> to <hi>sow</hi> your <hi>seed</hi> upon the <hi>water?</hi> They look upon the Doctrine to be senseless and unreasonable, and the <hi>Gospel of Christ foolishness</hi> indeed,<note place="margin">1 Co. i.18, 21, 23, 25.</note> if it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects they should obey such kind of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts as these.</p>
            <p>What therefore our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> once said with reference to his own <hi>preaching,</hi> I must here beg leave to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to ours: <hi>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John vii.17.</note> 
               <hi>or whether I speak of my self. If any man will do God's will</hi>; if he will sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely resolve to apply himself to the practice of Religion, then <hi>he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether we speak of our selves:</hi> He shall be fit and prepared to judge of what we speak, whether they are our own words, or the <hi>Gospel of Christ,</hi> and the Words of <hi>Eternal Salvation,</hi> that we deliver unto you.<note place="margin">Luke viii.14.</note> But till these <hi>thorns</hi> are first <hi>rooted</hi> out; (<hi>i. e.</hi>) according to the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which our <hi>Saviour</hi> gives us in this very <hi>Parable</hi>; till men have overcome their affections to the <hi>Cares,</hi> the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi> the <hi>Riches</hi> of this World, 'tis in vain to expect that any thing we can say should be able to prevail with them to <hi>bring forth fruit unto perfection,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ib.</note> and such
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59924:15"/>
as may carry them to everlasting Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the next. But,</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> And to <hi>close</hi> this first point; A <hi>fourth</hi> sort of <hi>Hearers</hi> there are, who profit <hi>nothing</hi> by our <hi>preaching,</hi> and those yet worse than any I have hitherto men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Malicious Hearers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A sort of Men, who come to our <hi>Churches</hi> now, as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees</hi> were wont sometimes to do to our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Discourses, not to improve themselves, but, if they can,<note place="margin">Mat. xxii.15.</note> 
               <hi>to intangle us in our Talk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not need to say, that such <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors</hi> as these are not likely to be much benefited by what they Hear. This is not what themselves aim at: their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is only to find faults, to lie in wait for any thing that they may but be able to make an ill use of, and like to some venemous Creatures, to suck poison out of the most wholsome Flowers. If a word, or an expression chance to fall from the <hi>Preacher</hi> which they think for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that is sure to be turn'd and scann'd to the uttermost: And though the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was never so innocent, yet 'tis great odds but by a false conjunction of things with one another, by a convenient alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and an uncharitable representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59924:16"/>
it shall be set forth to the World as some heinous Crime.</p>
            <p>And were they always our Open Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that did this, we should have the less reason to complain of them. We know their <hi>Principles,</hi> and what a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it is their <hi>Religion</hi> gives them, by any means to defame and abuse those whom their <hi>Church</hi> thinks fit to put the greatest abuse of all upon, in calling them <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi> But for men pretending to be our Friends, and our Brethren, to do the same thing; <hi>to bow the knee, and cry, Hail Master, and betray us,</hi> this is a piece of treachery that we cannot chuse but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and heartily beseech God may <hi>never be laid to their charge.</hi>

            <p>I shall not much labour to correct such <hi>Auditors,</hi> by shewing how mean and scandalous such a practice is: How contrary not only to all the <hi>rules</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> but even of common <hi>Honesty</hi> and <hi>Humanity.</hi> No, rather let them come and search us with all their industry; What is their <hi>Sin,</hi> will be our <hi>Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Nor could we desire any thing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were it not in <hi>charity</hi> to their Souls, than by defying even malice it self to find any just cause of Exception against us, to manifest the more clearly to the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59924:16"/>
World the Innocency and Excellency of our Holy Religion.</p>
            <p>There is nothing here done or said, but what we could be glad all the World were conscious of. We have no <hi>mystery of Iniquity</hi> to palliate, or to conceal. Our Religion and our Selves are every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where the same. What we <hi>preach</hi> to you in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> we speak to you in private; and, if occasion be, we <hi>publish</hi> it to all the World. Our <hi>Sermons,</hi> our <hi>Writings,</hi> our <hi>Conversation,</hi> are all of a piece. We have not one <hi>Doctrine</hi> to <hi>whisper</hi> to those that are <hi>initiated,</hi> and another to <hi>seduce</hi> those that are not.</p>
            <p>It is not therefore for our own sakes, that we complain of this fault in any of our <hi>Auditors.</hi> Were that the motive, could we be so wicked as to deliver any thing to you in <hi>God</hi>'s name, and as his <hi>Gospel,</hi> that we fear'd all the World should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come privy to, yet were it sufficient to know what kind of <hi>Hearers</hi> we some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have,<note place="margin">Mat. x.16.</note> to make us at least <hi>Wise as Serpents,</hi> if not <hi>Harmless as Doves.</hi> But though we are therefore sufficiently se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure as to our own <hi>Innocence,</hi> yet we cannot but be concern'd for our <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns</hi> sin. And beseech them, that they will at last be so kind to their own Souls
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59924:17"/>
as to consider how great the danger and sinfulness of such <hi>Hearing</hi> is; what a dishonour it brings to our <hi>Holy Religion,</hi> what a stop it puts to their <hi>Edification</hi> now, and how fatally ruinous it will fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally prove to their everlasting Salvation hereafter.</p>
            <p>But it is time for me to go on to the other part of this Discourse; that so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hitherto discover'd what the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Faults of our <hi>Hearers</hi> are, that so much indispose them to receive that benefit they ought by our <hi>preaching,</hi> I may now shew</p>
            <p>II<hi>dly,</hi> What Qualifications are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in such a One as will profit himself by these kind of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>Many are the <hi>Qualifications</hi> of this kind that might be offer'd; but I think the principal of them may be very well reduced to these <hi>four,</hi> and which I shall therefore particularly consider: <hi>viz.</hi> That he who will dispose Himself to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a profitable <hi>Hearer</hi> of these <hi>Holy Instructions,</hi> must

            <p>This, I have before observed,<note place="margin">Andronic. Rhod. Par. Eth. Nic. l. 1. cap. 4.</note> the very <hi>Philosophers</hi> required in the <hi>Auditors</hi> of their <hi>Morality:</hi> and sure it will be then so much the more necessary in our <hi>Hearers,</hi> by how much the Rules and Precepts of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> are higher, and more repugnant to the <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lusts</hi> and <hi>Interests</hi> of Men, than what they taught.</p>
            <p>Hence we find our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to have resolved the Cause of the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> into the indisposition of their Hearts, for want of probity and goodness to receive his <hi>Gospel.</hi> They were engaged in a Course of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Vain glory</hi>; they courted the praise and applauses of the People, and they could not endure to hearken to a <hi>Religion</hi> that would not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their <hi>vanity,</hi> nor preserve to them the Respect and Honour of the World, which they valued more than the Praise and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59924:18"/>
Glory of God.<note place="margin">Jo. v.44.</note> 
               <hi>How can ye believe</hi> (says he) <hi>that receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from God only?</hi> John v.44. And again, ch. xii<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. the Holy <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Jo. xii.42, 43.</note> 
               <hi>That among the chief rulers also many believed on Christ, but because of the</hi> Pharisees <hi>they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue. For they loved the</hi> Praise <hi>of</hi> Men, <hi>more than the</hi> Praise <hi>of</hi> God. And in general, our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> says,<note place="margin">Jo. viii.47.</note> ch. viii. <hi>He that is of God, heareth God's words; ye</hi> therefore <hi>hear them not, because ye are not of God.</hi> Where we find not only the true <hi>Character</hi> of him who will be a profitable <hi>hearer</hi> of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>word,</hi> viz. that he must <hi>be of God,</hi> as that <hi>Phrase</hi> is opposed to what our <hi>Saviour</hi> had just before said of those men, ver. 44. <hi>That they were of their father the devil, and followed the lusts of him; i. e.</hi> He must be an honest and upright man, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with such a Probity and Sincerity as becomes a Child of <hi>God</hi>; but also the reason why others are not qualified to receive the <hi>Gospel,</hi> viz. That they are of a temper of mind averse from holy things, and therefore not fit to profit themselves by the <hi>hearing</hi> of them: <hi>Ye therefore hear them not, because ye are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59924:18"/>
not of God.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> himself in his 1<hi>st</hi> Epistle,<note place="margin">1 Joh. iv. ver. 6. col. cum vers. 4, 5.</note> iv.6. gives the same for the reason why their Preaching, as well as <hi>Christ</hi>'s, had so little effect upon some Men; <hi>We are of God: He that knoweth God, heareth us; he that is not of God, heareth not us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, how can it possibly be, that a man who is not inclined to <hi>Piety</hi> himself, should be a fit <hi>Auditor</hi> of a <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> whose great end it is to promote it?</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> He is <hi>averse</hi> to it; he has no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish of what is spoken, nor can endure to hear his <hi>Lusts</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Vices,</hi> and darling <hi>Sins</hi> set forth as things that must either be abandoned here, or they will render him for ever miserable. And therefore our Saviour in the same St. <hi>John,</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">John iii.19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> that this shall be one part of the <hi>worlds condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their deeds were evil. For every one that doth evil, hateth the light, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> All the <hi>Arguments</hi> that can be offered for such a one's conviction, stick not at all upon him; they are as unsui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his apprehension, as if you
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59924:19"/>
would feed a <hi>Lion</hi> with <hi>Hay,</hi> or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an <hi>Ass</hi> with a <hi>Theorem.</hi> He has no sense of their force, nor is therefore at all like to be perswaded by them.</p>
            <p>To talk to a viciously inclined man, of the baseness and odiousness of his sins, what is this, but in his opinion to argue against his sense and experience? To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present to him the reasonableness, the pleasure, and comfort of living well, what is it else, but to maintain a <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,</hi> and shew a great deal of Skill, only to demonstrate how much may be said for the most incredible things? <hi>Heaven</hi> is a place which cannot raise his desires, who has not thoughts purified enough to be in love with innocent and spiritual delights. The pleasures of those happy Regions are not suited to the sensual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of such men, as know no attractives, but those of a <hi>Mahumetan Paradise</hi>: And <hi>Hell</hi> it self, tho the most formidable consideration of any, yet such as for that very reason, he will be sure to put as far from him as he can; and either fancy that perhaps there is no such place, or if there be, yet ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the escaping of it.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:59924:19"/>3. And then lastly, for that which is the great end of all religious instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Practice of Piety, and without which, all our knowledg in the <hi>Mystery</hi> of <hi>Godliness</hi> will be in vain; this is what such a one is yet more indisposed to, than all the rest. There are many in the world, who can be content to applaud the reasonableness of Piety and Virtue, and will allow of all that we can say in praise of it, that yet when it comes to the trial, cannot endure to put it in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. Like the <hi>Ground</hi> over-run with <hi>Thorns</hi> in the <hi>Parable,</hi> they receive the Word with gladness, but the <hi>Cares of the world, and the Pleasures of life, choak the seed,</hi> so that they seldom bring forth any Fruit unto perfection.</p>
            <p>It is therefore absolutely necessary, that he who will be a fit Disciple for the <hi>school</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> should first dispose himself by a <hi>Probity</hi> and <hi>Integrity of mind,</hi> to be willing to follow his Instructions. That he labour sincerely to have a <hi>Conscience void of offence, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and towards man.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts xxiv 16.</note> That he come to our Religious Exercises with a <hi>Pious Mind,</hi> not to please his <hi>Fancy,</hi> or gratifie his <hi>Curiosity,</hi> but to learn true <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and that in order to <hi>Practice.</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59924:20"/>
Instead of considering how the Discourse is managed, whether the <hi>Preacher</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms his part as he expected he should, he must employ his Thoughts on more substantial <hi>Meditations</hi>: In what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar especially the Disc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urse came up to his own condition, and how he may best apply it thereunto. If any <hi>Vice</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, whether his own Sin be not concerned in it. If any <hi>Duty</hi> explain'd or encouraged, whether that were not directed by God, to inform his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, or to reprove his remissness. If it set forth any of the great <hi>Mysteries</hi> of our <hi>Redemption,</hi> or the <hi>Glories</hi> of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and what we must do to attain to them; to remember that in all these things, God calls upon us to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg his Power, and to celebrate his Goodness, who has sent so wonderful and gracious a salvation to us.</p>
            <p>This is the true way whereby the <hi>Pious Christian</hi> may profit himself, even by the meanest of our <hi>Discourses</hi>; but without such a disposition to receive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, the best <hi>seed</hi> will in vain be <hi>cast away</hi> upon us.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> The next qualification required in a <hi>Christian Auditor,</hi> as well as in all others, is, That he be <hi>Docile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59924:20"/>By which I do not mean, Endued with quick Parts and Abilities to learn; that is the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and which sometimes may do more harm than good; but I mean, that he be desirous of Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to that end prepared with such a temper and disposition of mind, as to be willing and ready to pursue the means of it. And to this end more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> That he be <hi>Humble,</hi> i. e. neither vainly conceited of himself, as if he had no need of instruction; nor esteeming himself to be too great to receive it, even from the meanest <hi>Preacher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing in the world so great an Enemy to our Proficiency in any thing, as <hi>Pride</hi>: When men look upon themselves as too great to learn, and as such, neglect and despise the means of Instruction. Indeed I am not so vain, as to think that we are not many times called to speak to those who are much fitter to become our <hi>Teachers.</hi> But yet neither can I so far undervalue the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of Christ,</hi> which we deliver unto you, as to believe there is ordinarily any <hi>Sermon</hi> so mean and despicable, but that an <hi>humble</hi> mind might have profited by it, and have found somewhat at least to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59924:21"/>
exercise his <hi>Charity</hi> and his <hi>Patience,</hi> if not to excite his <hi>Zeal,</hi> and improve his <hi>Knowledg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A second thing required to this <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility,</hi> is, That a man be free from <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>This disturbs the mind, and blinds the reason, and hinders many times the best Doctrine from producing any suitable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects upon us.</p>
            <p>Those who are subject to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their own <hi>affections, judg</hi> more according to the <hi>inclinations</hi> of <hi>them,</hi> than to the <hi>dictates</hi> of <hi>right reason.</hi> He that espouses a Party or Interest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that loves an Opinion, and desires it should be true, easily approves of whatsoever does but seem to make for it; and rejects, almost at all adventures, whatsoever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears against it. How does the <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Desire</hi> of Honour, or Favour, or Fortune in the World, carry men away to the vilest things for the prosecution of it? And so all the other <hi>Passions</hi> of the <hi>mind</hi>; whether it be fear or pleasure, or whatever else be the <hi>affection</hi> that rules us, they hinder the <hi>reason</hi> from judging aright, and weighing impartially what is delivered to us; and 'tis great odds, but such an <hi>Auditor</hi> receives or condemns
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59924:21"/>
the Doctrine of Christ, not according as the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Holy Sripture,</hi> and the <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>right reason</hi> require he should, but as his own <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations</hi> prompt him to do.</p>
            <p>3. A Third thing required to <hi>Docili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is; That a man be free from <hi>Prejudice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that will advance any thing in the finding out of <hi>Truth,</hi> must bring to it that <hi>Travellers indifference</hi> which the <hi>Heathen</hi> so long since recommended to the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He must not <hi>desire</hi> it should lie on the one side rather than the other, lest his <hi>desire</hi> that it should, prompt him without just reason to believe that it does.</p>
            <p>And so in <hi>Religion</hi> too: He that will make a right judgment, what to <hi>believe,</hi> or what to <hi>Practice,</hi> must first throw off all <hi>prejudice</hi> in favour of his own <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,</hi> or against any others: And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve never to be so tied up to any <hi>Point</hi> or <hi>Party,</hi> as not to be at all times rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy impartially to examine whatsoever can reasonably be objected against ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>How far the want of this does at this day divide the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> I would to <hi>God,</hi> we had not too great reason on
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59924:22"/>
all sides to complain. There are many among us so strangely engaged by <hi>false principles</hi> to an ill cause, that 'tis in vain to offer them the <hi>clearest Arguments</hi> to convince them.</p>
            <p>If you bring them <hi>Scripture,</hi> 'tis true that must be heard, but then be it never so <hi>plain</hi> they are not competent <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>Meaning</hi> of it: and they durst not trust their own <hi>Interpretation</hi> to tell them that <hi>Abraham begat Isaac,</hi> if the <hi>Church</hi> should think fit to expound it otherwise. For such and so plain are many of those passages that we alledg against them, to shew their corruptions in a great part of those things wherein they differ from us.</p>
            <p>If you offer them Reason, as clear as the plainest Demonstration; why, that were well: But still <hi>Private Reason</hi> may <hi>Err,</hi> and the Church cannot.</p>
            <p>Convince them by their <hi>Senses,</hi> which one would think should convince any body; Desire them to consult the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of their own <hi>Eyes,</hi> and <hi>Mouths,</hi> and <hi>Noses,</hi> and <hi>Feeling:</hi> 'tis no purpose, the <hi>Senses</hi> may deceive them, but the <hi>Church</hi> cannot.</p>
            <p>Thus have they suffer'd themselves to be conjured into a <hi>Circle</hi> out of which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59924:22"/>
'tis impossible ever to Retreive them. <hi>Sense, Reason, Scripture,</hi> All are of no force against this one Prejudice of their <hi>Churches Authority</hi>; though at the same time they know not either what the <hi>Church</hi> is to whom <hi>Christ</hi> Promises are made, nor where to find it, nor what it has decided, nor wherefore they at all Adventures attribute to their <hi>own</hi> the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> of <hi>the only true Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such <hi>Hearers</hi> as these, are Unteach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and Unprofitable: And we ought certainly by their <hi>Example</hi> to beware of such an indisposition as is able to lead men into so strange a Slavery; and make them believe they are never more in the Right, than when they have put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of a Capacity of ever being so upon any Certain grounds, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than by meer Chance.</p>
            <p>4. A <hi>Fourth</hi> and last thing required to <hi>Docility,</hi> is a freedom from <hi>Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a disposition for the most part consequent upon that I the last mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and such as wherever it is found, renders a man utterly incompetent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any benefit by the best instruction, It is called by St. <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59924:23"/>
of judgment.</hi> When men resolve they will not be instructed, but affect igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and either to keep up a faction, or to serve their present Interests, or to indulge themselves the more freely in their sins, flee both the means and the desire of knowledge.</p>
            <p>And this, or somewhat like it, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Case of those of the other <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi> Who not content with the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices</hi> I before mention'd in favour of themselves and their own Opinions: do moreover engage their proselites by a most <hi>Solemn Oath,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tif. R. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do ad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil. Haer.</note> never upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or by <hi>any Argument whatsoever,</hi> to be drawn out of those Errors in which they have engaged them.</p>
            <p>Such then is the <hi>Nature,</hi> and these the Vices that are to be avoided by us, in order to the <hi>second Qualification</hi> required in a <hi>Christian Auditor,</hi> viz. <hi>Docility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The next I mention'd was, That he must be <hi>Diligent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which I mean, not only a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to attend upon all the publick <hi>means</hi> of <hi>instruction</hi> which God is pleased to afford us; but yet much more, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply those means to a right and due End. To be sedulous and diligent in embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Opportunities of <hi>hearing,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59924:23"/>
very commendable, and the duty of every Christian; but yet if his <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> stop here, he may for all that reap but little benefit by all his Care. He that will be truly <hi>sedulous,</hi> as he ought to be, Let him,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> When he comes to these <hi>Holy Exercises,</hi> be very careful that he attend with all his Soul to what is deliver'd; But especially if any thing chance to be spoken in which his <hi>Conscience</hi> tells him that he was either altogether <hi>Ignorant</hi> before, or not sufficiently instructed in it.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:59924:24"/>It was for this that God sent his <hi>Son</hi> to <hi>Preach</hi> his <hi>Gospel</hi> to the World; And 'tis for this that we still are commission'd by him to declare to you your duty, and press you with the strongest Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Hopes and Terrors of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> to be careful and sedulous in the performance of it. The End of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> was not to <hi>puff us up,</hi> but to <hi>Edifie us</hi>: To make us <hi>Better</hi> rather than more <hi>Knowing,</hi> and more <hi>Knowing</hi> only that we may be <hi>Better.</hi> They are not the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> that shall be justified before God, but the <hi>doers</hi> of it. It is but a half <hi>Diligence</hi> that carries men to Learn their <hi>Duty</hi>; He is the truly <hi>Sedulous</hi> Christian indeed who both seeks with all earnestness to know what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of Him, and then as carefully endeavours to put it in practice.</p>
            <p>Now to this end, and to conclude all,</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> He that will <hi>Hear</hi> as he ought to do, must to all these other <hi>Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> add his fervent <hi>Prayers</hi> to <hi>God</hi> for his Assistance.</p>
            <p>It is not an easie matter to become a Perfect <hi>Christian</hi>: So high and excellent are the precepts of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things so contrary to the <hi>Interests</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:59924:24"/>
and <hi>Inclinations</hi> of sensual Men; that without some extraordinary Assistance of the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, we are not able so much as to <hi>comprehend</hi> any thing of these kind of instructions as we ought to do. But to bring a willing and ready disposition of mind to receive the <hi>Word</hi>; to become such an <hi>Auditor,</hi> as not only <hi>speculative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to learn the great <hi>Truths</hi> of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> but to resolve <hi>effectually</hi> to put them in <hi>practice</hi> too; this must certainly be the work of God upon our <hi>Hearts,</hi> and 'tis his <hi>Grace</hi> alone that can both <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten</hi> our <hi>Vnderstandings,</hi> and <hi>incline</hi> our <hi>Wills.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here therefore we may see at once, both the necessity of this last <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi> our <hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>God</hi> for his <hi>Grace</hi>; and in that, the true cause why so many make no better an Advantage by their <hi>Hearing.</hi> They come to the <hi>Church</hi> as if they were going into a <hi>Theatre,</hi> where they had nothing to do but to attend to what is spoken, to render them every way competent <hi>Auditors</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>But alas! The <hi>Divine Truths</hi> that are here deliver'd, are above the discernment of the <hi>Carnal mind:</hi>

as these, like the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> may hear our words as they did our Blessed Saviour's; but they will not be at all the better for them. God <hi>must open their hearts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts. xvi.14.</note> as he did that of <hi>Lydia</hi>; and then our addresses will find a suitable admittance, and not pass with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a due and careful consideration.

               <note place="margin">Luke. xi.13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And now, How shall we wonder, if the <hi>seed,</hi> though never so carefully sown, produce yet but a very mean increase, when God knows for the most part the Ground is so utterly unprepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it? This certainly is a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ought to engage every good <hi>Christian</hi> seriously to search and examine himself, how he is disposed to become a fitting <hi>Hearer</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you have therefore hitherto come to our <hi>Assemblies,</hi> without such a due Preparation as you see is thus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to qualifie your minds to receive that benefit you ought from these <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,</hi> let me now earnestly beseech you no longer to deceive your own Souls, but to prepare them in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that our <hi>Preaching</hi> may not be in

vain to you. Let not any little, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy designs accompany you to these <hi>Holy exercises</hi>; But come as befits Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, with <hi>Charity,</hi> with <hi>Humility,</hi> with an <hi>Honest</hi> and <hi>Vpright</hi> Heart; sincerely desirous of understanding your Duty, how mean soever the person be that is to deliver it unto you.</p>
            <p>But above all come with a firm reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of <hi>Practising</hi> what you <hi>Hear.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that 'tis this <hi>Christianity</hi> designs in all its instructions; And however our <hi>Zeal</hi> in these latter days seems unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily engaged, more in the Pursuit of <hi>Divine Truth,</hi> than in what I could ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wish we did chiefly aim at, the <hi>Practice</hi> of a <hi>Divine Life</hi>; yet let us be careful so to maintain the One, as not to prejudice or overthrow the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And if we thus sincerely direct all our <hi>Hearing</hi> to the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and our own <hi>Everlasting Salvation,</hi> we shall not fail to <hi>Hear</hi> as we ought to do.

            </p>
            <p>In the Verses before the <hi>Text,</hi> we have a sad and terrible declaration of those <hi>Judgments</hi> that should hereafter befal them for their <hi>Impenitence.</hi> And it is not to be question'd, but that this great <hi>Prophet,</hi> from whom God never conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing that concern'd that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; had here by so much a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular prospect of those <hi>Evils,</hi> that were afterwards to come upon them, as he was now the nearer to be taken from them. And that 'tis from these there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that we must derive at once both the <hi>Occasion</hi> and <hi>Importance</hi> of that passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Wish into which the Holy Man here breaks out, in consideration both of their danger and of their insensibility of it,
<q>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:59924:27"/>O that they were wise, that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood this, that they would consider their latter end!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Whether by their <hi>latter end</hi> we are to understand that great and terrible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction which finally befel both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Country, in the loss of <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> Or, Whether with some, we shall interpret it of God's <hi>rejecting</hi> of them from his <hi>Covenant,</hi> from being what they were once, his own peculiar Inheritance: Or, Whether lastly, the more to heighten the <hi>Idea,</hi> we shall join them both together in the <hi>Prophecy,</hi> as they were by God united in the <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi>; certain it is, That a greater and more amazing instance of the Divine Vengeance upon a particular <hi>Nation,</hi> has hardly been known from the beginning of the World, than that of their Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; nor shall there I suppose be any Parallel, to the very end of it.</p>
            <p>But it is not my design to enter on any reflection of their Punishment, but to enquire rather what it was, that <hi>Moses</hi> here so much wishes they would have done, in order to the preventing of it; what that great defect was, which was the <hi>Cause</hi> of all their <hi>Evils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:59924:28"/>Now that in one word was <hi>Inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:</hi> A fault certainly very great in that people, than which none had ever received more clear and sensible Proofs of the Divine Power and Goodness. They had seen the <hi>Miracles</hi> by which God had brought them up out of the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi>; and continued to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them now almost forty years through the <hi>Wilderness.</hi> They had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held his <hi>Majesty,</hi> when himself in that terrible manner that we read in the xix<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and xx<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapters of <hi>Exodus,</hi> vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to give them his own <hi>Law</hi> from <hi>Mount Sinai.</hi> Nay, that nothing might be wanting to awaken a stupid and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible people, they had known his <hi>Judgments</hi> too in the punishment of their Sins. They had seen the Destruction which their Fathers had suffer'd, and they were here expresly foretold what Evils themselves and their posterity should hereafter undergo for their impiety. Yet was not all this sufficient to awaken their <hi>Consideration</hi> to a sense of their danger, and a care to prevent it.</p>
            <p>And now I would to God these <hi>Jews</hi> were the only men we could justly charge with this neglect; and that our own indifferency in the concern of our
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59924:28"/>
duty, did not equally tax us with the same <hi>Inconsideration.</hi> But alas! I fear, were we here to enter on a review, we should find but too just a parallel, both in our <hi>danger,</hi> and in our <hi>incogitancy:</hi> And that a very little reasoning upon the <hi>Methods</hi> of God's <hi>Providence,</hi> without the help of a Prophetick Spirit, might be more than enough, to make any sober, <hi>considering</hi> man tremble to think what shall be the consequence of such a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Insensibility</hi> as we have these many years shown, notwithstanding all his <hi>Mercies</hi> and his <hi>Judgments</hi> in vain made use of to reclaim us. At least, I hope it will be abundantly sufficient to Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize for me, if I beg leave, especially at such a <hi>Season</hi> as this, freely to expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with you in the words of <hi>Moses</hi> in the <hi>Text:</hi>
               <q>O that <hi>ye</hi> were wise, that <hi>ye</hi> understood this, that <hi>you</hi> would consider your latter end!</q>

            <p>In speaking upon a Subject, both in its self so important, and to us so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary; that I may, if possible, not omit any thing that may serve either to excite or to direct the practice of it, I shall endeavour with all the plainness I can, to discourse to you of these Four Things.

            <p>I begin with the <hi>First</hi> of these.</p>
            <p>I. Of the <hi>Danger</hi> and <hi>Mischief</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been the usual <hi>Method</hi> of most <hi>Casuists,</hi> in enquiring into the <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> to expose the Mischief, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate the Danger of those particular <hi>Temptations</hi> that are the immediate <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Hence there is hardly a man so little in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ructed in <hi>Morality,</hi> that has not learnt to run into an invective against the <hi>Interests</hi> and <hi>Pleasures,</hi> the <hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>Riches</hi> of this world; that the good Christian must resolve either to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them as much as is possible, or at
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59924:29"/>
least, to quit all undue Esteem, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Desire of them.</p>
            <p>But the great and Catholic Cause of all our evils, <hi>Inconsideration</hi>; this is either not at all, or but very lightly touch'd upon by them. So far are men from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the <hi>Danger</hi> of it, that I believe there are few who have yet learnt to place it in the number of their <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> or that think themselves at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to provide against it.</p>
            <p>Very necessary therefore it is, before I proceed to those particular Proposals I am hereafter to make for the removal of this evil, that I should first convince you of the necessity there is of setting about it; to show you, that of all the <hi>Artifices</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> this has been the most successful; that whatsoever strength any other <hi>Temptations</hi> may seem to have, 'tis all derived from the influence of this. In a word, That <hi>Riches,</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and <hi>Pleasure,</hi> and <hi>Interest,</hi> seduce some particulars only; triumph over the weakness of some certain dispositions that are more peculiarly apt to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them. But that <hi>Inconsideration</hi> is a general snare, stops not at particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, but carries all before it: The <hi>One, Last, Vniversal Cause</hi> of all our <hi>Sins</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:59924:30"/>
being no other than this, That we do not <hi>consider</hi> as we ought, what our <hi>Duty</hi> is, and what our <hi>Obligations</hi> are to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it.</p>
            <p>And 1<hi>st.</hi> It cannot be denied, but that this <hi>Inconsideration</hi> exposes us to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Temptation</hi> which the <hi>Devil</hi> shall think fit to lay in our way; is very often the <hi>Cause</hi> that we are tempted at all, but always the reason that we are overcome by the <hi>Temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not need to say how many <hi>Sins</hi> men fall into, for want of <hi>considering,</hi> and knowing that they were so. I would to God the frequent <hi>Excuses</hi> that are drawn from this <hi>Topick,</hi> did not too fully shew, how great a <hi>cause</hi> this is of our <hi>offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> There is hardly a more general Plea in the mouth of every <hi>Sinner,</hi> than that he meant no harm in what he did, but either he did not know, or he did not think that it was unlawful. But then I am sure we must resolve to lay aside this excuse altogether, and confess it to be as false, as indeed it is for the most part fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous; or we must be allowed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from it, that this want of Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, exposes men to infinite <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> by keeping them in an unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59924:30"/>
               <hi>Ignorance</hi> of what they might have known, and ought to have <hi>Consider'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they are not only the <hi>Ignorant</hi> that are concern'd in this danger. He who knows his Duty the best, is yet oftentimes no less surprized by his <hi>Inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitancy,</hi> than he who is the most Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it. The <hi>Devil</hi> who knows our weakest times, and constantly watches his advantage, never fails then especially to assault us, when he sees we are least upon our Guard, and by consequence least in a condition to resist him. And if by a diligent care of our selves and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to our Duty, we are not as ready and prepared to resist those <hi>Temptations</hi> which may be apt to sollicite us from it, as we are otherwise well instructed in the duty its self, 'tis evident, that our <hi>Enemy</hi> will have a very great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage against us; and 'tis odds if for want of being prepared to <hi>fight,</hi> we are not for the most part overcome by him.</p>
            <p>For 2<hi>dly,</hi> And which may be alone sufficient to confirm my assertion, that 'tis our <hi>Inconsideration</hi> that is the real, ultimate <hi>Cause</hi> of all our sin; be it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, secondly; That there are in our <hi>Religion,</hi> such <hi>Motives,</hi> such <hi>Engagements</hi> to <hi>Obedience,</hi> that were they but duly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59924:31"/>
weighed, it would be impossible for a man ever to live wickedly.</p>
            <p>And indeed he must be a very great instance of this defect I am now speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, and never have <hi>considered</hi> any thing at all of his Religion as he ought to do, that can reasonably doubt of what I now say.</p>
            <p>Is there any among us that has but once seriously reflected on the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>God Almighty</hi>: How excellent his <hi>Goodness</hi> is, how Terrible his <hi>Justice</hi>? With what an irreconcilable hatred he prosecutes <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Sinners</hi> for its sake? That he is <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> and cannot be <hi>Resisted: Omniscient</hi> and cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: Nay that he is <hi>Present</hi> with us, sees our most retired actions, and will one day bring them all to light in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the whole World, in the <hi>day when He shall judge the world in righteousness.</hi> Is there any one here, that has but serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>consider'd</hi> all this? Let him then say whether it were Possible for the Devil to have been able to draw him into Sin, whilst he had such thoughts as these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to his mind to oppose to his <hi>Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Christianity</hi> carries us yet farther. It shews us a <hi>God Incarnate,</hi> a <hi>God</hi> made
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59924:31"/>
               <hi>man</hi> on purpose for our Salvation; <hi>He gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all Iniquity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Titus ii.11.</note> 
               <hi>and purchase to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a peculiar people zealous of Good works.</hi> It represents to us a <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> Sealed with his own most precious <hi>Blood,</hi> and into which we have every one of us been solemnly initiated, that is, solemnly <hi>Sworn</hi> at our <hi>Baptism</hi>; and the condition wherof on our part we know was this, <hi>that we should forsake the Devil and all his works, the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World, and all the sinful lusts of the flesh</hi>; and instead of serving these, should obediently <hi>keep God's Holy will and Commandments, and walk in the same all the days of our Lives.</hi>

            <p>I shall not now enquire, how often we have, I believe, the most of us renew'd this <hi>Covenant,</hi> whether in the <hi>Church</hi> at the <hi>Holy Table,</hi> or on other <hi>Occasions</hi> that have called us to put up our <hi>Vows</hi> to Heaven. Nor need I add, that 'tis to such a <hi>Practice</hi> alone as that requires, that <hi>God</hi> has promised the <hi>Blessings</hi> of <hi>Eternal Glory.</hi> But sure I am whosoever will but duly <hi>consider</hi> the weight and moment of this one Engagement, will find in it an impregnable fortress against <hi>Sin,</hi> and such as all the <hi>Temptations</hi> in the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59924:32"/>
World should not be able to overcome.</p>
            <p>For to reflect on it only in a Word or two. What is there in all our <hi>sins,</hi> or in all those <hi>Temptations</hi> that lead us to them, whose <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> would not be utterly overcome by this one serious <hi>Consideration</hi>?</p>
            <p>Where is the <hi>Lust</hi> that can offer any sufficient, shall I say, or rather any tollerable inducement to comply with it, that may be worthy to compare with our obligations to <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Obey</hi> so Great, and so Excellent a <hi>Redeemer</hi>? Is there a <hi>Passion</hi> so darling, or an interest so Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, that the most desperate sinner would in his Cool thoughts be willing to <hi>exchange Heaven</hi> for it? Or rather, for indeed that is the true Case, would be content for the prosecution of it to go down, it may be the next Moment, into <hi>Hell,</hi> and there dwell with <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Burnings</hi>?</p>
            <p>No, no: <hi>Sin</hi> may <hi>deceive</hi> us by our own carelessness, but it cannot stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Consideration.</hi> It may surprize our <hi>Passions,</hi> but it can never reconcile its self to our <hi>Reason.</hi> Nor are our <hi>Natures</hi> yet become so degenerate, but that a due reflection on our Engagements to Obedience would by the <hi>Grace</hi> of God
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59924:32"/>
soon resolve into a performance of it: And the <hi>Hopes</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi>; The <hi>Vanity</hi> of this <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Eternity</hi> of the <hi>Next,</hi> once throughly consider'd as they ought to be, so <hi>stop our Ears,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. lviii.5.</note> that all the Arts of the <hi>Charmer, charm he never so wisely,</hi> should not be able to open them to his <hi>Insinuations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for a farther proof of this, and which may be yet another <hi>Argument</hi> to confirm my <hi>Position,</hi> that 'tis the want of <hi>Considering</hi> that is really the great and last <hi>Cause</hi> of all our Sin: Let me</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> Appeal to the common <hi>Practice,</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi>: No sooner does any one begin seriously to <hi>Consider</hi> these things, but he presently becomes a good <hi>Christian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is it else but this, that makes the very worst of Sinners if they come but into any danger or calamity; if any sickness or affliction befals them; any thing that but stops them in their wild Career so long as to give them only time to cool, and to <hi>Consider</hi> their <hi>Duty,</hi> and their great and dangerous deviations from it; what is it I say, but this, that makes these persons presently disclaim their Extravagancies: to confess that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59924:33"/>
they were mistaken in their notions of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> and had therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd the Interests of <hi>the One</hi> because they had either never known, or never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently consider'd the excellency of <hi>the Other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if perhaps these Pious reflections have not been able afterwards to secure their <hi>Obedience,</hi> but they have again return'd to the follies they so lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced; It is not that they are ever the more convinced that they were over-reach'd in the Argument: That <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> have not that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son on their side which we pretend, and which ought to engage them to the troublesome task of <hi>denying themselves,</hi> and forsaking all their <hi>sensual pleasures,</hi> and <hi>worldly interests</hi> for its sake: No, but only that their danger being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, they have also lost their <hi>Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> with it; and their <hi>Incogitancy</hi> now again exposes them to those sins, which no sooner shall some new occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on call them again to reflect on, but they will be no less ready again to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, than they were before.</p>
            <p>And now though I suppose it may by this time be sufficiently evident how great the <hi>Mischief</hi> of <hi>Inconsideration</hi> is;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59924:33"/>
yet for a final demonstration of its danger, I will offer one reflection more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is,</p>
            <p n="4">4. That whatever particular <hi>Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> we may at any time chance to be exposed to, they would all of them have no <hi>force</hi> at all, but for this one General defect.</p>
            <p>For let us not deceive our selves; <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Riches,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Interest,</hi> and if there be any other <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> besides that is yet more powerful than all these, they are not such omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Temptations as our corrupt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections would represent them to us; on the contrary, 'tis certain that they have no force at all but by our own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitancy; to consider them only, were to overcome them.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> For <hi>Pleasure</hi>: Is it imaginable that the base Voluptuary would pursue that, as he does, did he really reflect what shall in a little time be the End of his Debauches? That yet a few years, at the most, it may be a few months, or days, and all his <hi>Enjoyments</hi> shall cease; and his <hi>Pleasures</hi> be exchanged for Pain and Sickness, Impotence and Infirmity, and the rest of those Torments in this Life, that are usually the sad forerunners of his <hi>Eternal Punishment</hi> in the other?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:59924:34"/>2<hi>dly,</hi> For <hi>Riches</hi>; the next instance: Were it possible men should take so much Care and Labour to get them, and when they have got them, neither be satisfied with them themselves, nor do good to others, had they ever been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that <hi>Treasure in Heaven</hi> which the <hi>Gospel</hi> speaks of, so infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly surpassing all the highest acquisitions here; so much surer to be obtain'd, and for the most part so much easier too; and when it is got, for Ever to be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd?</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> For <hi>Honour,</hi> the next <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>: If there can be such a thing as <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> without <hi>Virtue,</hi> and that <hi>High Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and <hi>great Titles,</hi> and the rest of those trifles that have so long usurped the <hi>name,</hi> may indeed be allow'd the <hi>character</hi> of it: What other judgment can any <hi>considering</hi> man pass upon such <hi>Honour</hi> but this; That even <hi>Christianity</hi> apart, it must certainly be a very vain thing to <hi>build</hi> a man's <hi>hopes,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend himself and his life, upon that, which when all is done, depends upon other mens opinions of, and value for us; who too often give this <hi>Honour</hi> to the most undeserving Persons, and with whom the truly brave and worthy
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59924:34"/>
Man sometimes finds the least share of it.</p>
            <p>And then 4<hi>thly,</hi> for the <hi>Interests</hi> of <hi>this World</hi>; Good God! What can they appear to any serious, <hi>considering</hi> man, but meer <hi>Vanity,</hi> who has learnt of his <hi>Saviour</hi> to ask his <hi>Conscience</hi> that great and wise Question:<note place="margin">Mat. xvi.26.</note> 
               <hi>What is a man profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted if he should gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it not Evident, that in all these, and whatever instances besides can be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered of the greatest <hi>Temptations,</hi> 'tis only for want of <hi>Considering</hi> that they prevail upon us; and so, that not they, but our own <hi>Incogitancy</hi> ought to be charged by us as our greatest <hi>Danger</hi> and <hi>Mischief,</hi> The one, last, universal <hi>Cause</hi> of all our <hi>Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now if this be so, then it cannot certainly but be very well worth our while to search a little,</p>
            <p>II<hi>dly,</hi> Into the <hi>Causes</hi> of this <hi>Inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> the next thing I proposed to speak to.</p>
            <p>And the first, and perhaps the most fatal of all others, and which may serve to remove a very dangerous mistake
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59924:35"/>
we are apt to make in this affair is, That <hi>Men</hi> are <hi>wont</hi> to think they do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well <hi>consider</hi> these things, when in truth they do not <hi>consider</hi> them to any purpose at all.</p>
            <p>For indeed, what is that which men now a days to call <hi>Considering</hi>? If they are sometimes a little serious, if they reflect now and then upon the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of <hi>Religion</hi>: If they go to <hi>Church</hi> on <hi>Sundays,</hi> and are not scandalously wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the week after; If they receive the <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> in its seasons, and when they do so, sit down a while and reflect a little, a day or two, it may be the week before, upon their <hi>Sins</hi> and their <hi>Vanities,</hi> and then <hi>Sigh,</hi> and are <hi>Sorry,</hi> and <hi>resolve</hi> to <hi>Sin</hi> no more, this they call <hi>Considering</hi>; and this, I fear, is what makes up the Religion of a very great number amongst us.</p>
            <p>But alas! this is as far distant from that true <hi>Consideration,</hi> I would now recommend to you, as the little imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Effects of it, are for the most part inferior to that excellent Piety that would be the certain consequence of the other. 'Tis not every light reflection upon the business of Religion, that is worthy the name of a true <hi>Consideration.</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:59924:35"/>
He that will do this as he ought to do, must resolve to do it throughly: He must search to the very bottome of his Soul; Not a Sin so secret, not a Lust or Interest so dear or profitable to us, but what, to the best of our power, must be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into. Now all the danger of <hi>Sin</hi> in <hi>General,</hi> all the black <hi>circumstances,</hi> and heightning <hi>Aggravations</hi> of our own Sins in <hi>Particular,</hi> must seriously be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd: The <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Terrors</hi> of <hi>Eternity</hi> be throughly weigh'd; What the <hi>Goodness</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is, if we will yet repent; What his <hi>Judgments</hi> will be, if we shall continue to despise the Riches of his Mercy, and <hi>Treasure</hi> up to our selves <hi>Wrath</hi> against the day of <hi>Wrath.</hi> In a word, whatever may serve either to convince us of our <hi>Sins</hi> and of our <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> or to engage us to forsake the one, that so we may escape the other, must all be laid before us; till finally, by God's <hi>Grace,</hi> we are brought in the bitterness of our Souls, to such a sense of our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as shall engage us to a sincere <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> of our Sins, and <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>God</hi>'s Commands. And so work in us that change of Life, which alone is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to save our <hi>Souls</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p>He that gives off before he has done
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59924:36"/>
this, He may have <hi>thought</hi> of his <hi>Duty,</hi> if you will, but he has not yet <hi>consider'd</hi> as he ought to do: He may have prepared the way, but he is yet to run. In short, He may have <hi>consider'd</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny now a days do, who read the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> run through all the various <hi>Sects</hi> and Parties of <hi>Christians,</hi> who suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not the least <hi>Controversie</hi> to escape them, nor a <hi>Dispute</hi> to arise in which they do not interest themselves; and yet when all is done, have not one jot of <hi>real Piety</hi> in their <hi>Souls</hi>: but after a great deal of pains get only that <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg which puffeth up,</hi> and are yet to learn that <hi>Charity which Edifieth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the first, and perhaps one of the most fatal Cheats men commonly put upon their Souls: They flatter themselves that they do very well <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> these things, when indeed they do not <hi>consider</hi> them to any purpose, nor as they ought to do it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Second <hi>Cause</hi> of mens <hi>Inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and but little inferior to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, either in the danger or the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ality of it, is, That our <hi>Consideration is for the most part totally turned another way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a long time since the generality
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59924:36"/>
of Mankind seem to have fallen under a very dangerous mistake, That <hi>Religion</hi> ought not to be looked upon as their Business, but only as a thing by the by: somewhat to entertain their thoughts with upon solemn times, and in their Melancholly hours, but which 'twere unreasonable to expect amidst so great a plenty of other affairs, as the world now abounds with, should ordinarily be made the subject of their thought, and their Consideration.</p>
            <p>Thus have we utterly reversed the <hi>Maxim</hi> of our Saviour, and made not our Salvation, but the business of this World, our Imployments and our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, nay, Good God! our very Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and our Sins the <hi>Vnum Necessarium,</hi> the great thing to be taken care of by us: and we are so wholly taken up and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with these, that we have no lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to think at all, to be sure not to any purpose, and as we ought to do of <hi>that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, what wonder if when this is the Case, we see such very sad, 'tis true, but yet such very natural Effects of it? Whilst men reckon the concerns of this present life to be the main of their business, we ought not to be surprised
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59924:37"/>
if they <hi>consider</hi> no more of what may make for a better.</p>
            <p>Till this mistake be rectified, we may be troubled indeed to see men so <hi>Inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,</hi> but sure we ought not to admire it. We may with <hi>Moses</hi> wish, <hi>O that they were wise, that they would understand this</hi>! But till that be done, we cannot expect they should very much <hi>Consider their latter End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 3<hi>dly,</hi> Another <hi>Cause,</hi> and which I believe has kept very many from <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering</hi> as they ought to do, is, That 'tis <hi>Vneasie</hi> to them; and therefore they do not care to enter upon it.</p>
            <p>It is a great disadvantage to <hi>Religion,</hi> that tho there be really nothing in the World more pleasing or more agreeable to our Rational Natures, than the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it; yet has it something that is rough and uneasie in the first setting out, and which the <hi>habitual Sinner</hi> cannot without pains and difficulty get over.</p>
            <p>He that thrives by <hi>Sin,</hi> that grows <hi>Rich,</hi> or <hi>Great,</hi> or <hi>Honourable</hi> in the world, by Injury and Oppression, by Fraud and Flattery, will no doubt be very uneasie to embrace a <hi>Religion,</hi> that requires a Justice and Integrity in all our <hi>actions,</hi> that forbids all Violence and Rapine, all
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59924:37"/>
Artifice and Dissimulation; <hi>i. e.</hi> all those <hi>Methods</hi> by which he has been wont to encrease and flourish heretofore.</p>
            <p>Again: If a man has been used freely to indulge himself in all that his heart desired; to gratifie his <hi>Passions</hi> in their wildest irregularities; he will no doubt find it a matter of no small difficulty to <hi>deny himself,</hi> and resist and do violence to those appetites, which he has been so accustomed to comply with hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>So that in effect, whether out of a prevailing interest, or a real fear; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of an unwillingness to forsake sin, or a mistaken apprehension of the impossibility of overcoming it, Many, I believe, content themselves to go on without ever <hi>considering</hi> at all; and hate to reflect on what they are resolved never to reform.</p>
            <p>Or, if perhaps this does not carry them so far, as to make them totally lay aside the thoughts of <hi>Religion,</hi> yet at least, it renders them unwilling to set about it, and so produces a</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>th</hi>; And which is the last <hi>Cause</hi> I shall now mention, of that <hi>Incogitancy</hi> I am here complaining of; <hi>viz.</hi> That men are apt to <hi>Procrastinate</hi> this great
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59924:38"/>
Affair; They resolve they will one time or other <hi>consider,</hi> but never heartily and effectually do so.</p>
            <p>This is certainly a very great, and yet I fear a very general fault; and such as perhaps has ruined more souls than any one thing again in the whole world.</p>
            <p>It is a hard matter totally to silence <hi>Conscience,</hi> and stifle all the thoughts of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> But our unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is, that when we are thus put in mind of our duty, we either content our selves with some very slight and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial <hi>Consideration</hi> of it; or else we put off our Consciences, as <hi>Felix</hi> did St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to a more <hi>convenient Season.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus some refer these kind of thoughts to <hi>Old Age,</hi> and never come to it, but go down into the Grave, before they have made any just provision for it. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it may be, set it a shorter date, but then still some business or hindrance interposes, and then another time is fix'd, and that too is disappointed; and thus our lives run on, but the great work of <hi>Considering</hi> is still to come. It may be at length God's <hi>Grace</hi> is withdrawn, and <hi>Conscience</hi> grows weary of being any longer importunate, when it has been so often denied. And thus when we thought
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59924:38"/>
to have <hi>consider'd,</hi> we find neither will, nor strength, nor opportunity so to do.</p>
            <p>How much the more earnestly may I beg leave to exhort you this day, no longer to defer so great, and to be sure so necessary a work as this; and to that end, that you will pass on with me to the Third <hi>Point</hi> I proposed to speak to.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Of the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Consideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sum whereof in <hi>general</hi> will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from the resolution which I shall give to these Two <hi>Enquiries.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1<hi>st. How,</hi> or after <hi>what manner</hi>:</item>
               <item>2<hi>dly. When,</hi> or at <hi>what times,</hi> this is to be done by us.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> For the <hi>former</hi> of these; <hi>how</hi> we are to <hi>practice</hi> this <hi>Consideration</hi>? I reply, That we must do it by a serious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Enquiry both into <hi>our selves,</hi> and into <hi>our Religion</hi>; by a diligent and strict examination, what our <hi>Duty</hi> towards God is, and what our own <hi>Performances</hi> have been, and ought to be of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the former <hi>part</hi> of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, <hi>Our duty towards God</hi>: I shall not need say any thing to shew how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary this is to be well understood by us. I am persuaded there is no one, how negligent soever he may have been in his
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59924:39"/>
performance of it, but what is sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced of his obligations to it.</p>
            <p>I will rather complain, that in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so necessary, that our <hi>Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> depends upon it, and God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so easie too, to the very meanest capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, there should nevertheless so many continue in as utter an <hi>ignorance</hi> of it, as if we too were some of those who encourage a <hi>blind Obedience</hi>; and esteem an ungrounded <hi>Assent,</hi> to be the best <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> indeed the <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>Devotion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been the fault of many in the practice of this kind of <hi>Consideration,</hi> to fix their thoughts wholly upon some parts of their <hi>Religion,</hi> but to take little or no notice at all of the rest. Thus many run away with the <hi>Promises</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> but never consider what they have to entitle them to those <hi>Promises.</hi> Others, on the contrary, look wholly on the difficulty of its <hi>Commands</hi>: and as if that had given them a final release from all endeavours to fulfil them, they conclude that 'tis impossible for them ever to be able to live as they ought to do, and that therefore 'tis in vain to try whether they can or no.</p>
            <p>Some when they read the great, and no
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59924:39"/>
doubt very just <hi>Elogies</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> stop there, and never trouble themselves either to consider what that <hi>Faith</hi> is, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of, much less to go on to St. <hi>James,</hi> and there see the necessity of <hi>good works</hi> too. They sit down contented that they have a <hi>right faith</hi>: They are members of a <hi>Pure, Reform'd Church</hi> on the one hand; or else of an <hi>unerrable, infallible, Catholick Church</hi> on the other, and so all is secure: As if the espousing such or such an Interest or Party, were an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable <hi>mark</hi> of <hi>Election,</hi> and all that God requires in order to our <hi>Salvation.</hi>

            <p>Many are the mistakes of this kind, which men are apt to fall into, in the Consideration of their <hi>Duty,</hi> and to all which I will only offer this one plain <hi>Rule</hi> for their direction: That whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will <hi>consider</hi> it as he ought, must do it <hi>universally,</hi> he must leave no part of his <hi>Religion</hi> unexamined; being assured of this, That whatsoever <hi>Consideration</hi> does any way contribute to lessen <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> nay rather, does not very much serve to help and promote it, is false and imperfect; and if he stops there, will certainly deceive and ruin him in the end.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:59924:40"/>2. For the other part of our Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>our Selves</hi>; two things there are, on which the <hi>Practice</hi> of it must chiefly terminate; <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What our <hi>State</hi> is, with reference to what is <hi>past?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. How to govern our selves for the time to come?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>It would require some longer time than I may presume to allow to this Discourse, but barely to enumerate the several <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Cautions</hi> to be observed in the doing of this. With what Care and Diligence, with what Exactness and Particularity; in a word, with what Piety and Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we must proceed in all this; and search into the real <hi>Grounds</hi> we have, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hope or fear, and accordingly give God the Glory, whether by a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>continuance</hi> in that Piety which we have hitherto practised, or by our <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> for those sins we have unhappily committed.</p>
            <p>This is a work which I have always thought the proper business of a <hi>Casuist,</hi> or if you will, of a <hi>Confessor,</hi> rather than a <hi>Preacher.</hi> General Rules seldom come up to particular mens conditions. Nor is it possible for the most exact Discourse, to give any satisfaction comparable to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59924:40"/>
those directions which our <hi>Church</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore exhorts us to seek by a free opening of our Condition to some of those who are appointed by God to be our <hi>Guides</hi> in these matters.</p>
            <p>And to them therefore let me beseech all those who are sensible of any want of farther Instruction in this matter, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress themselves for such Advice, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Nature nor Limits of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, permit me to offer to them. As for the other thing proposed in order to the Practice of this Duty,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly, When,</hi> or at <hi>what Times</hi> this is to be done by us? If the question be concerning the last sort of <hi>Consideration</hi> I just now mentioned, that of our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; 'tis evident that this must be perpetual; because it has so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry an influence upon all <hi>Moral Actions.</hi> The same Prudence which directs eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wise man before he acts, to sit down and consider what he is going about, whether it be fit to be done by him, ought certainly yet much more to carry every good Christian to this farther ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Reflection, Whether it may be done by him? And whosoever ventures upon any Action without this, he may by accident not do ill; but 'tis his good
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59924:41"/>
Fortune, not his Praise, that he does not. And were it never so good, yet for want of doing it with that design, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be such, he must not expect that God should ever <hi>impute</hi> that <hi>to him for Righteousness,</hi> which he himself did not design or perform with that intent.</p>
            <p>As to the other sort of <hi>Consideration,</hi> That of our <hi>State,</hi> and of our <hi>Duty</hi>: What God requires of us, and how we have lived according thereunto? Certain it is, that 'tis absolutely necessary that we should some time or other enter upon it; and then, I suppose, I need not say how very prudent it will be for us not to defer it. For since our <hi>Life</hi> is but a puff of breath, every <hi>day</hi> in our <hi>Nostrils,</hi> and which we can at no time say shall be our own the next moment: surely it will very much concern us not to defer <hi>considering</hi> how we are provided for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, seeing we have so very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Hopes or security in this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repentance</hi> is not a Duty that can be discharged in a Moment, and I fear the best among us upon the enquiry will find that we stand in need of a very great one. Now there is no time, no place for <hi>Repentance,</hi> but only in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Life: And should we suffer our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitancy
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59924:41"/>
so far to prevail upon us, as to neglect it here, we shall in vain la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our sin and our folly to all Eternity hereafter.</p>
            <p>If there be therefore any one among us, that has hitherto omitted so great and necessary a <hi>Consideration,</hi> what shall I say to him? Let him no longer defer it: Nay, but rather in the words of holy <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 132.3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>Let him not go back unto his house, nor climb up into his bed; let him not suffer his eyes to sleep, nor his eye-lids to slumber,</hi> till he has begun to set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
            <p>It were, no doubt, very much to be wish'd, that men would not suffer any day to slip, without this <hi>Consideration.</hi> There is, I believe, but seldom a day passes, in which we are not guilty of something that may justly call for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Repentance,</hi> to obtain our forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And who can tell, if he lies down to sleep e're he has done this, whether he shall ever rise up to perform it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards?</p>
            <p>But alas! This is the greatest Instance of all of our <hi>Inconsideration.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of repassing in this manner every day upon our Actions, I fear there are many who go on whole Weeks, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59924:42"/>
Months, and Years, without ever think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all of it; as if it were enough to practice this <hi>duty</hi> by the same proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which some of our modern <hi>Casuists</hi> have prescribed for that other of the <hi>Love of God</hi>; some of which have thought it necessary to be done only upon <hi>Sundays</hi> and <hi>Holy-days</hi>; others not above <hi>once a year</hi>; some once in <hi>Five years</hi>; others at any <hi>one time</hi> in our <hi>whole lives</hi>; and lastly, others <hi>never</hi> at all, either <hi>living</hi> or <hi>dying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thô there be then no <hi>time</hi> so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as the present, for the doing of that which cannot without the greatest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be deferr'd the least moment; yet some <hi>seasons</hi> there are, which seem more especially to invite us to it.</p>
            <p>Thus 1<hi>st.</hi> If <hi>old Age</hi> be crept upon us, or any <hi>Sickness</hi> or <hi>Danger</hi> threaten us with a speedy appearance before <hi>God's Tribunal</hi>; this ought certainly at the same time that it admonishes us of the shortness of our present life, to call us to an immediate providing for the next.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thô the hand of God be not just upon us, yet if we see his Arm lifted up to strike; if we have some just cause to apprehend any evils or afflictions likely to come upon us: much more if our
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59924:42"/>
               <hi>Country</hi> and our <hi>Church</hi> be in danger for the iniquity of her Children and People within her; this also may be another <hi>time</hi> that seems on purpose mark'd out to call us to <hi>Consideration</hi>; to think upon our ways, and how to prevent both our own, and the publick desolation.</p>
            <p>But now, 3<hi>dly.</hi> If these Evils are not merely apprehended, but are actually upon us; so that we already have begun to bear the punishment of our sins, and may have just cause to apprehend yet more dreadful effects of them; this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ought yet more strongly to engage us to such a Consideration.</p>
            <p>In such circumstances as these, the worst of men naturally become Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. God himself could say of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Israelites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. v.15.</note> 
               <hi>That in their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they would seek him early.</hi> And the Prophet observed of all men in general, That <hi>when God's Judgment are in the Earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. xxvi.9.</note> 
               <hi>then the inhabitants of the World will learn Righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will only add, 4<hi>thly,</hi> And with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the approaching season; That as the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>Lent</hi> has in all <hi>Ages</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> been look'd upon as a season proper for the business of <hi>Repentance</hi>; so certainly we cannot better prepare for it,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59924:43"/>
than by the practice of this great Prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary duty of <hi>Consideration,</hi> without which it will be impossible for us ever to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it as we ought to do. And however the <hi>Godly Primitive Discipline</hi> of <hi>Publick Confession</hi> and <hi>Penance,</hi> has for the hardness of our hearts, been of late laid aside among us; yet ought we not therefore to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the less, nay rather we should be the more careful to <hi>examine</hi> our own <hi>souls,</hi> and <hi>call our ways to remembrance</hi>; and by our <hi>Private Diligence</hi> make some supply of what seems to be acknowledged by our Church,<note place="margin">See the <hi>Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> used on <hi>Ash-wednesday.</hi>
               </note> as wanting to our <hi>Publick Discipline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to the end I may the better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force this Practice, which upon all these accounts seems so very proper for us, I will now finally <hi>Close</hi> all,</p>
            <p>IV<hi>thly,</hi> With some <hi>Motives</hi> that may serve to stir us up to the fulfilling of <hi>our duty,</hi> in so great and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a part of it.</p>
            <p>I have already observed in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Discourse, That 'tis the want of <hi>Consideration</hi> that is really the last, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Cause of all our Sins. And I have just now shewn, That till it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, it will be impossible for us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59924:43"/>
of them. And sure then one would think that nothing more need be said, to engage any sober man to the practice of it.</p>
            <p>But I must now go yet farther: For to compleat our Obligation to so necessary a practice, <hi>Inconsideration</hi> is not only to be charged as the cause of all our evils, but the corrupter of our good too: It spoils our very vertues; insomueh, that were it possible for the unthinking man to fulfil every Command, and not deviate in the least degree from the rules of his duty, all would be in vain; his <hi>Inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> alone would ruin him, and his Virtues themselves lose by it not only their Praise, but their very Nature too: Would become at most, but mere indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Actions, neither worthy in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor deserving of any reward for the fulfilling of them.</p>
            <p>God Almighty, who has given us our Understandings and our Wills on purpose for his <hi>Service,</hi> requires the concurrence of them in all our <hi>Actions</hi> that are intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that purpose. His <hi>Service</hi> must be reasonable, or it will not be accepted. He is not to be pleased with what we do by chance; where his Glory is not designed, he looks upon it, that neither
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59924:44"/>
is it advanced. And that good which is done without <hi>Considering,</hi> is but a mere <hi>Natural Action,</hi> deserves as little praise as a <hi>Plant</hi> for <hi>growing,</hi> or a <hi>Stone</hi> for <hi>falling down to its Center</hi>; and we may as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably expect to see one of these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to Heaven for so doing, as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking man be judged worthy of it, for any thing he can do.</p>
            <p>But, 2<hi>dly.</hi> This <hi>Incogitancy</hi> does not only render us thus obnoxious to God, but it exposes us to the censures of men too: It does not only deprive us of all our pretences to <hi>Piety,</hi> but even to common <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Discretion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that never <hi>Considers</hi> in any thing, all the World will say is a <hi>Fool</hi>; and sure I may well add, That he who <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders</hi> only in little things, and never thinks in those that are of the highest importance, is not so wise as he should be. But to pretend to be <hi>Christians,</hi> and to desire <hi>Salvation,</hi> and yet never reflect what it is to be the One, or how we are to live that we may attain the Other; this is certainly such a combination of Folly and Impiety, that were not sin as great an Enemy to <hi>Reason,</hi> as it is to <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> 'twere impossible that any man should ever be guilty of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:59924:44"/>And now when so many engagements concur to recommend this duty, that 'tis impossible for us to approve our selves ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to God or man without it, what shall I say more to stir you up to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it?</p>
            <p>I am, methinks, unwilling so far to comply with the melancholly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of very many, and those not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without just grounds too, as to desire you to think whether our Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances at this time, be not such as may well engage us in the literal import of our <hi>Text, to be wise, and consider our latter end,</hi> for ought I know, the <hi>final end</hi> of our selves and our Religion, if we do not by a speedy <hi>Repentance</hi> reverse that Judgment which God seems ready to pronounce against us for our <hi>Incogitancy.</hi> I will rather <hi>close</hi> all with a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent engagement. Blessed be God, who has made this a <hi>Duty</hi> as pleasing as it is necessary; as apt to incite our practice, as 'tis fit to be practised by us. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to <hi>Consider</hi> these things, after all the frightful <hi>Idea's</hi> men are apt to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of it, is not only one of the most useful, but one of the most pleasing things in the whole world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:59924:45"/>Let me appeal to the experience of those Pious Souls, who by a due per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this Exercise, have their <hi>Conversation</hi> already <hi>in Heaven</hi>; are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated above the little Passions and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests that engage the busie part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in so much labour and vanity. Who live in this World as if they were not of it; free and quiet in the midst of its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances; still the same in every estate; who love nothing but God and their Duty, fear nothing but to sin against him, nor desire any thing but to be <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, and to be with him.</hi> Whose well-grounded <hi>Hopes</hi> already secure them of their future Reward; and a <hi>Good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> so fully justifies them, that neither <hi>Death,</hi> nor <hi>Hell</hi> its self, not any evils of this life, or any terrors of the other, are able to disturb the Peace and Calm that is within them.</p>
            <p>O happy state! The blessed effect of a serious and frequent <hi>Consideration</hi>! Where is the Sinner that can pretend to say, he has ever found in any of his ways of Wickedness, a pleasure compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that Peace and Joy, which such a <hi>Christian</hi> meets with even in the present course of his Life?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:59924:45"/>Let the <hi>Miser</hi> boast his <hi>Riches</hi>; The <hi>Ambitious Man</hi> his <hi>Honours</hi>; let the <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuary</hi> wallow in his sensual and beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfactions: But ô Lord! What <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> are all these when compared with the solid Comfort and Satisfaction of a Good <hi>Conscience</hi>: that can reflect freely upon its Actions; can search into the most secret parts of its Life with Joy and Assurance; and delight to compare its Duty and its Practice, and see how Gloriously the One illustrates and sets forth the Other.</p>
            <p>Who would not pursue the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of such a state, tho' there were no such thing as Heaven and Eternity to follow after? Certainly if <hi>Pleasure</hi> be that which is to govern our pursuits, 'tis the good Christian that, when all is done, is the only Wise Man; and to <hi>Consider,</hi> the most delightful practice of any in the World.</p>
            <p>Only let us <hi>Consider</hi> seriously, and as we ought to do: Let us once in our lives be persuaded heartily to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a Duty, which we have been so often told should be the great Business of them. Let us be willing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced; and do our <hi>Religion</hi> and our <hi>Souls</hi> so much justice, as to give these
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59924:46"/>
things a fair and an Equal hearing.</p>
            <p>So shall all those Blessings I have now been speaking of, descend upon us. We shall exchange only, not lose or les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen our Enjoyments. Whatsoever Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or satisfaction we have heretofore met with in the ways of Sin, we shall find them all infinitely surmounted in the Practice of Religion. Till finally being fit for <hi>Heaven,</hi> ripe for <hi>Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> we shall be Translated from these Excellent, but yet still imperfect Joys here, to those absolute and Eternal <hi>Blessings, which neither Eye has seen, nor Ear heard, nor does it enter into the Heart of Man to conceive.</hi>
            </p>
            <closer>To which God of his Infinite Mercy vouchsafe we may all arrive, through <hi>Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi>

            <p>There are few so ignorant in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but are able at least to trace out his most ordinary <hi>Temptations,</hi> and to discover what it is that the most usually <hi>exposes</hi> them to <hi>Sin.</hi> And though he has his <hi>Crooked</hi> and <hi>by-paths</hi> too, <hi>Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> both more subtily laid, and more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be discern'd; yet a little more vigilancy and care would serve to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver even these also,<note place="margin">1 Cor. iv.5.</note> and to <hi>bring to light the most hidden</hi> Mysteries of Iniquity.</p>

Point 26. of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences. n. 6.</note> It has been the great Endeavour of those of the <hi>Other Communion,</hi> to establish on this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure of St. <hi>Paul</hi> with this <hi>Corinthian,</hi> their new and dangerous Doctrine of <hi>Humane Satisfactions</hi> to be made for <hi>Sin,</hi> and of the power of the <hi>Church</hi> to grant <hi>Indulgences</hi> for the <hi>Remission</hi> of them. But I desire now to have no other <hi>Enemy</hi> but that of my <hi>Text</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter: And the half of whose <hi>Devices</hi> will be more than enough for our present Consideration, without exposing the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices</hi> of any Others, how busie soever
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59924:48"/>
they too may be <hi>to get an Advantage of us.</hi> And therefore it shall suffice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark with reference to the <hi>Subject</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; That all which can reasonably be concluded from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>process</hi> with this <hi>Corinthian,</hi> is no more than what we readily allow of; <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Exercise</hi> of <hi>publick discipline</hi> for the <hi>correction</hi> of <hi>Open</hi> and <hi>Scandalous Offenders</hi>; and whom the <hi>Church</hi> has certainly Power both for their Sins to separate from her Society, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> did this <hi>Incestuous Man</hi>; and upon a sincere Repentance to release the <hi>Censure,</hi> and receive them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into <hi>Communion,</hi> as in this <hi>Chapter</hi> he ordered them to do this <hi>Penitent Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now this is neither the <hi>Doctrine</hi> nor <hi>Practice</hi> of those who pretend to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from this place. Their <hi>Satisfactions</hi> and <hi>Indulgences</hi> are of another kind than what <hi>Canonical Penances</hi> and the <hi>Relaxation</hi> of them will amount to. They suppose that after mens <hi>Sins</hi> by the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Penance</hi> are <hi>Forgiven</hi> to them, so that there is now no more <hi>Guilt</hi> remaining, nor by consequence any more <hi>Obligation</hi> to an <hi>Eternal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> due to it; there continues ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless an <hi>Obligation</hi> to <hi>Temporal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:59924:49"/>
to be undergone as a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>Proper satisfaction for Sin,</hi> either <hi>here,</hi> or in <hi>Purgatory:</hi> and that this the <hi>Pope</hi> has power to <hi>dispence</hi> with, by <hi>Apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to them the <hi>satisfactions</hi> not only of <hi>Christ,</hi> but of all his <hi>Saints</hi>; who having lived severe Lives, and suffered a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Temporal Punishment</hi> than was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to <hi>satisfie</hi> for their <hi>own Sins,</hi> have left a Stock in <hi>Bank</hi> to the <hi>Treasure</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> for the advantage of others; and the <hi>Remission</hi> of these <hi>Temporal Pains,</hi> by such an <hi>Application,</hi> this is that which they properly call an <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now then we may beg leave to ask, In what part of this <hi>History</hi> do they find any grounds for all this? Did St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>former Epistle</hi> command the <hi>Church of Corinth</hi> to <hi>impose</hi> a <hi>Penance</hi> on this <hi>Incestuous Man</hi> to <hi>satisfie</hi> for his <hi>Sin?</hi> No; But he commanded them to <hi>Excommunicate</hi> him for his Offence, to cut him off from the body of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to whom he had given so great a <hi>scandal</hi> by his <hi>uncleanness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or here in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> does he send him any kind <hi>Bull</hi> with a <hi>plenary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence</hi> for what he had done, to set him free of what <hi>Temporal Pain</hi> might yet be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59924:49"/>
due for his Offence; and to acquit him of any further trouble now, and of the danger of <hi>Purgatory</hi> hereafter? Not so neither: But he orders the <hi>Governors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to take off the <hi>Censure</hi> under which he lay; and to receive him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into <hi>Communion</hi> with them; and <hi>to confirm their Love towards him; Lest he should be swallow'd up of over much Grief, and so</hi> Satan <hi>get an advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In short, That there is here a plain account of the <hi>Exercise</hi> of <hi>Publick Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi> both in the <hi>Excommunicating</hi> of this <hi>Incestuous Corinthian,</hi> and in the <hi>Receiving</hi> of him <hi>again</hi> into <hi>Communion,</hi> this we readily confess. But for the new-inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Humane Satisfactions</hi> to be made for <hi>Sin,</hi> and of the Power of the <hi>Pope</hi> to apply one Man's <hi>Merits</hi> to the <hi>Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of another Man's <hi>Offences</hi>; and all this after such a manner, and upon such terms as is now Practised in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> of all this there is not one word either in this, or any other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> but much to the contrary, as might easily be made appear, were I minded to enter on such a Debate.</p>
            <p>But it shall suffice me to have remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59924:50"/>
thus much, for the clearing of the present place from these Abuses. As for those <hi>Devices</hi> which I am now to consider; <hi>viz.</hi> By what means and motives it is that the <hi>Devil</hi> after all our Cautions and Engagements to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, nevertheless still continues to draw us into <hi>Sin</hi>; many there are, and I cannot pretend in this Discourse to comprehend more than a very small proportion of them. I will take up those that seem most useful to be remark'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these two Considerations:
<list>
                  <item>I<hi>st.</hi> Of those <hi>Devices</hi> whereby he makes it his business to <hi>hinder</hi> us in the <hi>Discharge</hi> of our <hi>Duty.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II<hi>dly.</hi> Of those <hi>Devices</hi> whereby he leads us into the <hi>Commission</hi> of Sin.</item>
               </list>
I begin with the <hi>Former</hi> of these, the Consideration,</p>
            <p>I<hi>st.</hi> Of those <hi>Devices</hi> whereby the <hi>Devil</hi> is wont to <hi>hinder</hi> us in the <hi>discharge</hi> of our <hi>Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here, I shall not insist on those common and obvious <hi>Methods</hi> which every one knows, tho' few are so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as they ought to be to prevent them;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59924:50"/>
such as <hi>carelesness</hi> and <hi>indifference</hi> in the <hi>concern</hi> of our <hi>Salvation; The Love of this World</hi>; and of the <hi>Honours,</hi> and <hi>Pleasures,</hi> and <hi>Interests</hi> of it: and which upon this account, St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>the root of all evil:</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi.10. And St. <hi>James</hi> plainly tells us <hi>is Enmity with God. James</hi> iv.4. The <hi>Devices</hi> I shall now consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, are such as have more of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty and Contrivance in them; and which by a shew of somewhat that seems to be Good, seduce men many times into a <hi>neglect</hi> of that <hi>Duty,</hi> which alone really and truly is so. Now four things especially there are by which the <hi>Devil</hi> is wont to discourage, and hinder weaker Minds in the discharge of their <hi>Duty: viz,</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1<hi>st,</hi> By throwing <hi>Prejudices</hi> in their way against it.</item>
                  <item>2<hi>dly,</hi> By instilling into their Minds <hi>False Principles,</hi> whereby to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Practise of it.</item>
                  <item>3<hi>dly,</hi> By filling them with <hi>Doubts</hi> and <hi>Scruples</hi> to discourage them in their Piety.</item>
                  <item>4<hi>thly,</hi> By engaging their Zeal in vain and fruitless <hi>Strifes</hi> and <hi>Disputes</hi> about Religion, which ought
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59924:51"/>
to be imployed on the <hi>Practice</hi> of it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1<hi>st.</hi> It is none of the least of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> to hinder mens Piety, by throwing of false <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices</hi> in their way against the <hi>Practice</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>I need not say what a frightful thing many look upon a Christian course of Life to be, and how <hi>difficult,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even <hi>impossible</hi> they think it, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil that Duty which <hi>God</hi> requires of us.</p>
            <p>They regard him as a hard and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere <hi>Task-Master</hi> that lays intollerable <hi>Burdens</hi> upon his <hi>Servants,</hi> and has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared <hi>Eternal Punishments</hi> for the least defailure under them. All their thoughts are taken up with those Strict <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> of <hi>Mortification</hi> and <hi>Self-denyal,</hi> of <hi>taking up the Cross,</hi> of <hi>forgiving and loving Enemies</hi>; of despising any losses, shame or other difficulties they may at any time be exposed to for the <hi>Sake of Christ</hi> and the <hi>Preservation of a Good Conscience.</hi> Thus they look upon <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> to be a Religion made up of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Melancholy Fears,</hi> and <hi>amazing Dangers</hi>; that allows of no Pleasure, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not the least Appetite to be grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59924:51"/>
but denies even the most Innocent and Reasonable Enjoyments; nor promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses any Happiness in another World, but upon the severe Condition of being De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised and Miserable in this.</p>
            <p>And now when such are Mens Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of <hi>Christianity,</hi> what wonder if we see so few care to enter on the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it? But Blessed be God, who has not thus dealt with us.<note place="margin">Mat. vii.14.</note> 
               <hi>Straight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the gate, and narrow the way</hi> that leads to Heaven, but by the <hi>Grace</hi> of God it is not Impassable. From the very first entring, it dilates its self, and in a little while becomes no less plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, but much more secure, than that <hi>High Road</hi> which so many prefer before it.</p>
            <p>To be plain, I dare affirm, That a State of Religion is so far from being that four disagreeable State men commonly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it to be; that on the contrary 'tis the only State that is attended with a real Pleasure and Satisfaction. <hi>Godliness</hi> is its own reward, even in the present pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it:<note place="margin">1 Tim. iv.8.</note> It <hi>has the promise of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to come.</hi> And whosoever will but seriously apply himself to the discharge of it, will soon be convinced upon how good Grounds
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59924:52"/>
the wise man once pronounced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it;<note place="margin">Prov. iii.17.</note> That <hi>her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for that frightful <hi>Idea</hi> which so many entertain of <hi>Religion,</hi> it is wholly founded on their own mistakes of the true <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> of it. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> It is utterly false that <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> denies us any of those Enjoyments, which a Wise man would even desire to Indulge. It allows whatever is truly fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for us, and restrains only those bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish excesses, which even <hi>Natural Reason</hi> and the Principles of <hi>Common Morality</hi> forbid us to pursue.</p>
            <p>Nor 2<hi>dly,</hi> Do men any more truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present God, than they do his Religion. They look upon him as one who requires great things of us; but they forget that he who requires these things, does also Promise that if we are not wanting in our own Endeavours, he will give us <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> and <hi>Ability</hi> to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil them. They consider him as a most severe, and <hi>Just Judge</hi>: But they do not consider, that his <hi>Mercy</hi> is as Infinite as his <hi>Justice</hi>; and that he is as ready to make allowances for our <hi>Infirmities,</hi> and Pardon those <hi>Sins</hi> we unwillingly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, as to Punish those Offences which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59924:52"/>
our <hi>Malice</hi> and our <hi>Negligence</hi> expose us to. That for this He has <hi>sent his own Son into the World,</hi> to be Himself <hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our Sins</hi>; and to open the way to Heaven by a <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> seeing we could not attain to it by any way of a <hi>Perfect</hi> and <hi>unsinning Obedience.</hi> So that now then, let a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian be but upright and sincere, let him but <hi>love God,</hi> and delight in his Service, and strive and labour as far as he is able to fulfil it; If he <hi>Sins,</hi> let him Repent of it, <hi>let him confess his Wickedness, and be sorry for his Sins,</hi> and humbly Implore God's Mercy to forgive him; and then how Weak and Impotent soever he be, He shall certainly find not only Pardon, but acceptance too with his Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour for ever.</p>
            <p>And then, 3<hi>dly,</hi> For what concerns those severe <hi>Duties</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and upon which the strongest prejudices are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly raised against it: Besides that they are things infinitely excellent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and by a divine assistance far from being burdensome to us; nay, when put in the balance with the reward of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory,</hi> not worthy to be compared with it; 'tis Evident that these <hi>Duties</hi> are not required either of all <hi>Christians,</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:59924:53"/>
or at all times. How few are there, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, now a days, that have any occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to put in practice that severest precept of all which our Religion Requires of us; viz,<note place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. xvi.24.</note> 
               <hi>To deny our selves, and take up our Cross, and follow Christ</hi>? These are the Tryals on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of some <hi>singular Persons,</hi> and at some <hi>certain Seasons.</hi> And whenever God sees fit to call any good men to them, He never fails upon their earnest <hi>Prayers</hi> to Him, to furnish them with <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to bear them.</p>
            <p>So that upon the whole, it appears, that all these <hi>Prejudices</hi> are only the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices</hi> of the <hi>Devil</hi> to discourage Men from their <hi>Duty</hi>; and by the false appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of I know not what imaginary difficulties in the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> now, to precipitate them into <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Eternal</hi> Miseries hereafter. But</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> A <hi>Second</hi> way whereby He hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers men's progress in <hi>Piety</hi> is, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilling such <hi>Principles</hi> into them, as are apt to corrupt the practice of it.</p>
            <p>And here had I the time to insist upon them, I would not doubt to rank in the very first front, those <hi>Atheistical</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which the brisk Disputers of our Age so much abound with; Who not
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59924:53"/>
content with the <hi>Psalmist</hi>'s <hi>Fool,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. xiv.1.</note> to <hi>say in their heart, there is no God,</hi> dare open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispute against his <hi>Being,</hi> and with their mouths deny that God whom yet in their hearts they acknowledg, nay whom their <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>terrors</hi> into which every the least accident throws them, even testifie to the world, that for all their <hi>Gallantry</hi> they cannot disbelieve.</p>
            <p>Or, because this is the presumption on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a few desperate men, I would beg leave rather to argue a little with some of our more refined <hi>Sceptics,</hi> the great Assertors of <hi>Human Reason,</hi> in <hi>opposition</hi> to the <hi>Sacred Authority</hi> of <hi>Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> Who allowing of a God, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless <hi>strengthen themselves in wickedness,</hi> by their ungrounded Notions of his <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi>: Whilst they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it to be inconsistent with either of those <hi>Attributes,</hi> for him to punish a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and transient sin, with <hi>everlasting Torments</hi>; tho committed against an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite God, and against the plain terms of a Covenant of <hi>Eternal Happiness</hi> if we do well, and of <hi>Everlasting Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> if we do ill, entred into by us at our <hi>Baptism,</hi> and at <hi>Confirmation</hi> made our own act, by our own express consent to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:59924:54"/>Or, lastly, because such too there are amongst us, I would reason with those who argue against the malignity even of <hi>Sin</hi> it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> self, and would by their disputes turn the greatest <hi>Vices</hi> into <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>indifferent Actions:</hi> Whilst from the strong inclinations which they find in themselves to <hi>evil,</hi> they conclude, that certainly it ought not to be esteemed so very great a fault to pursue the dictates of that <hi>Nature</hi> which <hi>God</hi> himself has implanted in us: And that doubtless our <hi>Passions</hi> were never designed to be mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a snare and a torment to us, as yet they conclude they must be, unless we will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it to be lawful for them as freely to indulge them, as they unreasonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend they ought to do.</p>
            <p>But all these, and a few others of the like kind, how destructive soever they may be of true Piety, are the <hi>Principles</hi> of Men not yet beginning to be religious; and by consequence, such as I ought to suppose are needless to be obviated in this Assembly. Those I would now remark, are of another nature, <hi>Principles</hi> upon which even good Christians do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times flatter themselves in Wickedness, or at least neglect to live up to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness of Christian Practice, as they ought to do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:59924:54"/>Now such I esteem first of all, that popular mistake by which many persons too easily delude themselves, of a <hi>good mind</hi>; a <hi>desire</hi> and an <hi>intention</hi> to live well, and which they hope shall attone for all their miscarriages, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their good intention, they still continue to commit. This is a <hi>Principle</hi> which I fear deceives very many in the world. They cannot deny but that they are indeed very great sinners; but yet they are sorry for it, and they desire to live better. But alas! What shall they do? They are weak and impotent as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are; exposed to a thousand Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations every day, and who is there that either does or can withstand them all?</p>
            <p>And indeed, where the <hi>Intention</hi> is so good, as to make men careful and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in their duty; if they sin only by surprize or incogitancy, and when they do so, <hi>repent</hi> them truly, and watch themselves more diligently for the time to come; I will not deny, but that here their <hi>good Intention</hi> may find acceptance with God Almighty. But otherwise, to think that a weak desire, and a vain reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and a transient sorrow, the usual Piety of those who rely upon this excuse, shall find favour at the Great Day of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59924:55"/>
This is that <hi>Device</hi> which the <hi>Devil,</hi> I fear, deceives many withal, but for which there is not the least ground or colour in the <hi>Holy Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And from this proceeds another mistake, and that not at all less dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than the foregoing; which is, To reckon all those sins which after such a <hi>good intention</hi> they commit, to be <hi>sins of Infirmity,</hi> and which they perswade themselves may be consistent with a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> now, and with the hopes of <hi>Glory</hi> hereafter.</p>
            <p>Thus if when they commit a sin, their Conscience checks them, and they parly with the Temptation, and strive a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and then yield, and then they are sorry and make some transient, ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual resolutions of doing better for the time to come, but which all vanish at the very next trial; this they call <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> and so God knows it is, but such an <hi>Infirmity</hi> as will by no means excuse the sins which they commit upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sins</hi> of <hi>Infirmity</hi> are of another kind; they are <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>imperfect sins,</hi> when we are either <hi>surprized</hi> into the <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of them, or otherwise hurried on by some <hi>sudden fear,</hi> or other the like
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59924:55"/>
powerful <hi>Passion</hi> or overbearing <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> before we have time to consider what we do, or to arm our selves with firmness and resolution against it. But otherwise, where the sin is known, and the Will free, and there was time for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, and yet we agreed to it, this can by no means be called a <hi>sin</hi> of <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>: And here the frequency of the Commission, or the easiness of falling, may serve to <hi>aggravate</hi> indeed, but sure will by no means <hi>extenuate,</hi> and much less <hi>excuse</hi> the guilt of it.</p>
            <p>I might to these add, 3<hi>dly,</hi> those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which I am persuaded, have not a little contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to mens neglect of true Piety, <hi>viz.</hi> of being <hi>saved</hi> by others Performances; of <hi>Purgatory</hi> and <hi>Indulgences, Masses</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> for the <hi>Dead</hi>; of the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Priest</hi> to <hi>absolve sins</hi>; and of an <hi>imperfect, ineffectual sorrow</hi> for <hi>sin,</hi> suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to <hi>dispose</hi> a man to receive the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Absolution</hi>; of the <hi>efficacy</hi> of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> to obtain their ends, tho the person be not otherwise in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to obtain the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> without them; and in which some of them have gone so far, as to declare <hi>Contrition</hi> to be rather a <hi>hindrance</hi> than a <hi>benefit</hi> to the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59924:56"/>
               <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Penance</hi>; and one adds plainly,<note place="margin">Morin. de Poenir. l. 8. c. 4. n. 26.</note> That the <hi>excellence of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Gospel in general, above those of the Law, consists in this, That they have freed us from the</hi> intolerable yoke <hi>of</hi> loving God, <hi>and being</hi> truly sorry for our sins.</p>
            <p>I need not after this say any thing of the extravagance of their late <hi>private Casuists,</hi> remark'd and censured by many of their own <hi>Communion,</hi> and not long since by the <hi>Pope</hi> himself, yet still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, notwithstanding both, to be but too much applauded by very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers amongst them. But these being <hi>Principles</hi> against which I hope I need not prepare any one of our <hi>Communion</hi>; I will instead of all these, mention only one <hi>Principle</hi> more, 4<hi>thly,</hi> By which men often hinder their progress in Piety, and that is a <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Compliment</hi> and <hi>Good Breeding.</hi> When they neglect their duty, it may be do that which they know to be contrary to it, but yet rather than be thought <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>precise,</hi> rather than they will disturb Company, or be markt out as singular, they will do as others do, and so disobey God, for fear of disobliging men.</p>
            <p>That this is a Case which very often
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59924:56"/>
occurs in the method of our present Conversation in the World, is not to be denied. Now then consider, I beseech you, what the Contest here is, and what the issue most certainly will be. <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> are the Parties concerned, and the question is, Whether your <hi>Duty</hi> towards him, or your <hi>Civility</hi> towards the other, ought to preponderate? Whether you should go to Heaven with a few, singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, out-of-fashion Christians, or for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany sake take the broad road, tho you know that it leads to Eternal Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And now when the choice is so plain, methinks it should be no hard matter to persuade men to despise such a <hi>Principle</hi> as this. To convince them that their <hi>Salvation</hi> is a concern of too great importance to be submitted to these formalities, and that 'tis to push the Compliment a great deal too far, to be <hi>damned</hi> rather than be thought <hi>ill bred.</hi> But</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly.</hi> A Third Device whereby the <hi>Devil</hi> oftentimes endeavours to hinder mens progress in <hi>Religion,</hi> is, by filling their minds with <hi>groundless fears</hi> and <hi>scruples</hi> as to their <hi>Eternal Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a matter of sad Consideration to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59924:57"/>
think what discouragements many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians labour under, in the discharge of their duty; who either wanting a Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to receive a satisfaction, or indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a close and melancholly disposition so long, till they are at last incapable of any, live in doubts and fears, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities of mind, and it may be by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, wholly cast off all thoughts of Religion, since they cannot find any peace or satisfaction in it.</p>
            <p>Now tho such troubles as these may much more easily be prevented before they arrive, than removed after; yet there are ways to encounter even this <hi>Device</hi> too of our Enemy, and to render it of no force to hinder our Piety. To which end,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> If any <hi>fears</hi> or <hi>scruples</hi> of this kind arise in your minds, examine your selves, and see whether there be any real grounds or foundation for them. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your lives have been such as may give you just cause to apprehend your selves in danger of <hi>losing your souls?</hi> If there be nothing of this kind which you can discover to support such fears, then consider with your selves, that the tenor of God's <hi>Threats</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> is very
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59924:57"/>
plain, and easie to be understood. That he will never condemn any man in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, but for living in a disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Commands in This. That our duty is clear and express; and that Conscience, when sincerely examined, will not fail to tell us whether we do truly fulfil it or no. And therefore that, as St. <hi>John</hi> says, <hi>Beloved,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Jo. iii.21.</note> 
               <hi>if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God.</hi> But should the case be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise; should you find your selves in never so dangerous a course of sin, yet still 'tis in your power, by God's Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, to deliver your selves out of it. And then, <hi>There is mercy with God, that he may be feared.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psa. 130.4.</note> So that be your state at the present never so dangerous, yet if you will even now lay hold upon his Mercy, if ye will yet <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>return unto the Lord your God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh 19.</note> 
               <hi>and confess your sins, he is faithful and just to forgive you your sins, and the blood of Christ shall cleanse you from all unrighteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now 2<hi>dly,</hi> If your <hi>Case</hi> be <hi>dubious,</hi> and neither these nor any other reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are able to give you that satisfaction you desire, yet should not this move you to give way to the <hi>Tempter</hi>; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59924:58"/>
should engage you to set your selves the more diligently to this work; to call in some <hi>Spiritual Guide</hi> to your assistance; and if upon a sincere opening of your state to him, neither can he find out any grounds for your <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>scruples,</hi> your <hi>doubts</hi> and your <hi>apprehensions</hi>; you ought then to labour by all means <hi>to possess your Souls in Peace</hi>; and to conclude, That these Terrors are only the <hi>Devices</hi> of the <hi>Devil</hi> to discourage you in your duty, not any real causes for <hi>doubt</hi> or <hi>despair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet 3<hi>dly,</hi> Thô neither by these nor any other means you should ever be able totally to overcome these difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yet ought not this to make you ever the less careful of going on still in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious discharge of your duty. Nay, on the contrary, it ought to make you the more <hi>zealous</hi> and <hi>diligent</hi> in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it. A man that lives here all his life in such perplexities, if yet he fulfils that obedience, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices that repentance which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, may nevertheless be saved at the last. But he that upon any of these grounds neglects this, tho he goes on never so securely and comfortably in his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59924:58"/>
evil way, shall certainly fall into ruin and destruction in the end. And since such <hi>fears</hi> as these, arise from an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension that we do not live so well, nor serve God so sincerely as we ought to do; the best means, when all is done, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them is, if it be possible, to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live even our own apprehensions, and to <hi>serve</hi> God so <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>heartily,</hi> as not to be able to doubt, but that we shall find a reward for it at his hands.</p>
            <p>I shall add but one thing more in this <hi>Case,</hi> (4<hi>thly,</hi>) and it is this. Be not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, nor think your <hi>Faith</hi> imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or your <hi>Religion</hi> vain, because you find your selves still attended with some <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>anxieties</hi> about your <hi>future state.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> not only allows this, but exhorts us, with his <hi>Philipians, To work out our own salvation with fear and trembling.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. ii.12.</note> To be without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in a matter of such moment, were to be stupid and insensible, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than religious. And when we come to appear before <hi>Christ</hi> in <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> we shall be sentenced, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our own <hi>Opinions</hi> or <hi>Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions</hi> of our selves, whether good
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59924:59"/>
or evil, but according to the <hi>Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of our <hi>Lives,</hi> to the <hi>Extent</hi> of our <hi>Charity,</hi> and to the <hi>Truth</hi> of our <hi>Repentance.</hi> And all these supported and made perfect by the <hi>Merits</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of a most Gracious and Merciful <hi>Redeemer,</hi> who will pity and pardon beyond what we are able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press or to conceive. But,</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> And to conclude this <hi>Point,</hi> The last <hi>Device</hi> by which the <hi>Devil,</hi> in these days especially, has endeavoured to hinder our Piety, is, by turning that <hi>Zeal</hi> into <hi>Strifes</hi> and <hi>Disputes</hi> about Religion, which ought to have been employed on the <hi>Practice</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>For indeed, were we now to enquire what the great demonstration of all our <hi>Zeal</hi> is, both in the <hi>Priests</hi> and the <hi>People,</hi> what other account should we be able to bring back than this, That they are all hot and furious for their several <hi>particular Opinions</hi>; as if the whole <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and all the <hi>Hopes</hi> of <hi>Eternity,</hi> depended on them; but for the <hi>Practice</hi> of a <hi>Gospel-life,</hi> for that <hi>Devotion,</hi> that <hi>Charity,</hi> that <hi>Humility,</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> which were once the great Care and Ornament of the <hi>Christian
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59924:59"/>
Church,</hi> these, God knows, are but little regarded by the most of us.</p>
            <p>If, 1<hi>st.</hi> We consider the <hi>Publick Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> of these <hi>Controversies</hi> to a <hi>decay of Piety</hi>: What a desolation shall we find too often occasion'd by them? I need not tell you how many <hi>Countries</hi> have been ruined; what <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> have been <hi>murthered,</hi> and <hi>banished,</hi> and <hi>deposed</hi> by their own people; what <hi>Blood</hi> has been <hi>spilt</hi>; what numbers of <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>innocent</hi> people, <hi>men, women,</hi> and <hi>children,</hi> have been lost and undone by them. And by a strange <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosis,</hi> Cruelty and Oppression, Falseness and Dissimulation, Deceit and Perjury, all the vilest and most scandalous sins, by the Sacred Power of the <hi>Churches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,</hi> consecrated into <hi>Christian and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical Virtues.</hi> And to compleat the astonishment, the Holy <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Confessors</hi> have been damned to Hell, whilst their <hi>Persecutors</hi> have been <hi>Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and placed in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If 2<hi>dly,</hi> We look upon these <hi>Disputes</hi> in themselves only, without regarding any such <hi>desperate effects</hi> of them: I wish I had no occasion to say how preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial they have even thus been, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59924:60"/>
without God's Infinite Mercy, might have been much more to our <hi>common Christianity</hi>: Whilst by the means of these, not only <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Heresies</hi> (and even those too, St. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons among the <hi>works of the flesh,</hi> Gal. v.20. which whoso are guilty of, <hi>cannot inherit the kingdom of God</hi>) have crept into the <hi>Church;</hi> but, Some from these <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests</hi> have concluded all our Religion to be uncertain; and esteem'd it the wisest way not to join with any of us, till we can somewhat better agree to which of us they ought to go. Others, considering the manner how these <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies</hi> have, of late especially, been managed and carried on, have with some colour of reason, been tempted to <hi>believe</hi> all our Pretences to be only <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi> and <hi>Vision</hi>; for that surely did those who stand up in the defence of Religion, believe it themselves, they would never defend their <hi>Faith</hi> in such a manner, as utterly <hi>contradicts</hi> all the <hi>Morality</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Which of the great <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> have not our modern <hi>disputes</hi> call'd in question? It is but a very little while since the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>Sacred Trinity,</hi> and the Glorious <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> have again been struck at, by those
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59924:60"/>
who plainly shew they care not what becomes of <hi>Christianity,</hi> if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make their <hi>Popish Heresie</hi> prevail with it. And that if not in so plain and direct a manner as the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> of our days do; yet in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no less repugnant to the belief of them. For if the <hi>contradictions,</hi> as they say, be indeed as great in these, as 'tis plain they are in that other <hi>Mystery,</hi> or rather as one of their own great <hi>defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> of it truly called it,<note place="margin">Card <hi>Perron.</hi>
               </note> That <hi>MONSTER</hi> of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> to which they are compared; I doubt all considering persons will resolve from the <hi>self-evident false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the <hi>one,</hi> to conclude against the others; rather than from their belief of <hi>those,</hi> to give up their assent to <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we look to the <hi>Morality</hi> of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi>; let the Heat and the Passion, the Bitterness, and the Evil-speaking; shall I add, and even the fraud and dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which have appear'd in these debates, be a sad evidence how destructive such disputes are of true <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> Whilst to lessen an Adversary, or to be thought to get the better in an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, men value not how or what they write; but seem resolved at any rate to maintain their point, thô for the doing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59924:61"/>
of it they are forced to such shifts, as without God's Infinite Mercy, must lose them their own Souls.</p>
            <p>What shall I say to that <hi>Epidemical Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableness</hi> that is from hence diffused into the several <hi>Parties</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi>? Whil'st every one seems to reckon his Enemy no better then a <hi>Heathen</hi> and a <hi>Publican</hi>; and having by their uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble censures cut him off from the hopes of <hi>God's Mercy hereafter,</hi> think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves afterwards disengaged from all obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations even of <hi>common humanity</hi> towards him now.</p>
            <p>I speak not this, as if I meant to accuse those of our <hi>Church</hi> who have so generous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stood in the Gap, and sacrificed their <hi>Peace,</hi> their <hi>Quiet,</hi> and their <hi>Interests</hi> to the defence of an excellent Cause, and a truly <hi>Orthodox, Catholic,</hi> and <hi>Apostolic Church:</hi> And much less would I be thought hereby to discourage you from being as <hi>zealous for the Faith,</hi> and as <hi>constant</hi> in its <hi>defence,</hi> as both your duty requires, and as, I bless God, you all of you are this day, and I hope, and am persuaded, will ever be so.

to the <hi>practice</hi> of Religion. I speak it, earnestly to beseech and exhort you, even by the <hi>Bowels</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> that you will be careful to add to your <hi>Faith Works:</hi> To adorn your holy Profession, by a suitable Conversation: To live to the Honour of your <hi>Church,</hi> as well as to dispute for it: And seeing ye know what danger these <hi>Controversies</hi> are apt to bring to the <hi>decay of Piety,</hi> that you would be careful to prevent them, and not suffer your <hi>Zeal</hi> for your <hi>Faith,</hi> ever to carry you to any unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian or unwarrantable measures in the defence of it.</p>
            <p>And thus have I set before you some of those <hi>devices</hi> whereby the <hi>Devil</hi> is wont to <hi>hinder</hi> our <hi>Piety</hi>; I have but just time to mention a very few of the other kind, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II<hi>dly,</hi> Those by which he is wont to draw us into the <hi>commission of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been an ancient Remark, and the reason whereof is so deeply rooted in our very Natures, as may justly make it a <hi>first principle</hi> in this <hi>Enquiry; That Evil, as such, is not desirable.</hi> No Man ever commits a <hi>sin</hi> for <hi>sinning sake,</hi> but upon the account of some good or other
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59924:62"/>
which he either really does, or at least thinks shall accrue to him thereby.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis upon this, the <hi>Devil</hi> founds all his <hi>devices</hi> to deceive us. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves our <hi>Interests,</hi> our <hi>Tempers,</hi> and <hi>Inclinations</hi>; what it is that either our <hi>Condition,</hi> or <hi>Circumstances,</hi> or <hi>Designs</hi> in the World render us the most apt to be caught with, and accordingly offers his <hi>Temptations</hi> to us in such a manner as may be most like to prevail with us.</p>
            <p>So that then to arm our selves against those <hi>Artifices</hi> by which he is wont to draw us into Sin, we shall need no long search, no laborious enquiry into his particular <hi>Temptations.</hi> Only let us turn our eyes into our own Souls; there let us consider what sins they are we are the most apt to fall into, what passions the most command us, to what irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities our Tempers, or our Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces lay us the most open, and this will presently both shew us our danger, and how we ought to fortify our selves against it.</p>
            <p>But thô to enter therefore upon all the particular <hi>Devices of Satan</hi> whereby he leads Men into <hi>sin,</hi> be a work as needless as it would be infinite; yet some gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral remarks there are, which we may
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59924:62"/>
do well to make in order to our secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>And 1<hi>st.</hi> It is commonly the first step which the <hi>Devil</hi> takes towards the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men into <hi>sin,</hi> to perswade them to a Carelesness and Indifference in their <hi>duty.</hi> Whil'st Men are warm and vigorous in the practice of Piety, zealous of God's Honour, and sincere in the pursuance of what makes for it; 'tis plain the Enemy can get but very little <hi>advantage of us.</hi> But if instead of this, we live only in <hi>a form of Godliness, and regard not the power of it:</hi> If we are negligent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd for Religion, and take but little notice of what it requires of us; We are then ready for the <hi>Tempter</hi> to make his Assault upon us: And 'twill be no hard matter to deceive that Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>commission</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> who is already but very little affected with the sense of his duty, nor takes any great care for the fulfilling of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Another <hi>device</hi> whereby the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> often gets an <hi>advantage of us,</hi> not only to hinder our Piety, but even to lead us into the greatest violations of it, is by the <hi>Customs</hi> and <hi>Opinion</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> I have before observed what Slaves we are, the very best of us, to these things.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59924:63"/>
They <hi>corrupt</hi> our <hi>Practice,</hi> and <hi>debauch</hi> our very <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Vnderstanding.</hi> And we may at this day find many things in the practice of mankind, become the praise and accomplishment of a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> which, were we to examine them by the Rules of the Gospel, would be seen to have no part in the <hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</hi> And then I need not say how fatal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dangerous that must be to lead us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>sin,</hi> which is able so far to deceive our very <hi>Consciences,</hi> as not to be thought to carry any <hi>guilt</hi> or <hi>shame</hi> in the <hi>commission</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>And these are such <hi>Devices</hi> whereby the <hi>Devil</hi> oftentimes draws men into <hi>Sin</hi>; I will add only two more, whereby, when once men are engaged in a <hi>course</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> he is wont to strengthen and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in it: <hi>viz.</hi> 1<hi>st.</hi> An unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Hope</hi> of <hi>God's Mercy</hi>; And 2<hi>dly.</hi> A vain dependance on their own <hi>future Repentance</hi>: That is to say, They sin on now, in prospect of amendment hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and then they make no doubt but that they shall find favour and mercy with God, as well as other sinners in the like circumstances have done before them.</p>

               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:59924:63"/>But, O God! what a desperate reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is this, whereon to venture all the <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Glories</hi> of <hi>Eternity</hi>! For tell me, O Sinner! whoever thou art that thus projectest a future Amendment, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thou hast taken thy fill of Pleasure, and art no longer able to pursue thy <hi>Sins</hi> and thy <hi>Debaucheries</hi>: What security hast thou, that That God whom thou so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spisest shall continue thy life to thee, and give thee any such Time and Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to repent? Canst thou command the <hi>Sun</hi> that it should stand still, and put a stop to thy days, that thou may'st the more freely follow thy Revels and thy Delights? Or canst thou hope, when thou lyest down on thy last Bed, with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> to add a new Series of Years to thy expiring breath, by then lifting up thy profane Heart, and thy deceitful Voice, to That God whom thou hast so long continued to offend?</p>
            <p>Nay, but couldst thou do this, and so arrive to the time thou hast assign'd for this Work; Art thou sure thou shalt then be in a <hi>Capacity</hi> of fulfilling it? There is a time when there shall be no more any opportunity for <hi>Repentance,</hi> tho' we should have otherwise leisure enough for the accomplishing of it. And sure, if any
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59924:64"/>
such is, the most likely to be that <hi>Season,</hi> which <hi>Wicked Men</hi> have lay'd out for their return to their duty, in order to their going on for the present in their evil doings. Nor is there any reason why that man should expect <hi>Grace</hi> to <hi>repent</hi> at the last, who all his life long has neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and despised the Offers of it.</p>
            <p>I will not now say how unfit a time that of <hi>Old Age</hi> and <hi>Sickness</hi> is for so great an undertaking: When the <hi>Soul</hi> as well as <hi>Body</hi> is feeble and impotent; when the <hi>Memory</hi> is decay'd, the <hi>Reason</hi> fails, and our <hi>Affections</hi> are dull, our <hi>Zeal</hi> is cold, and all our thoughts taken up with the <hi>horrors</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> and the <hi>sense</hi> of those <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities</hi> under which the <hi>Body</hi> labours. But sure I am, all these things ought to convince men of the desperate folly, and even madness of such a <hi>procrastina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; and to engage them, whil'st they have yet the time, to lay hold upon that Mercy, which it may be they shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after neither have <hi>Grace</hi> nor <hi>Opportunity</hi> to implore.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>Ye therefore, <hi>Beloved,</hi> seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own <hi>stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>

            <p>THese words are not only the <hi>Close</hi> of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> but also the <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of all that the <hi>Apostle</hi> before had written in it. And for the understanding
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59924:66"/>
of them, we must observe, That the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in this Address to the Christians dispersed abroad among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and now under great temptations either to corrupt or to abandon that <hi>Faith</hi> that had <hi>once</hi> been <hi>delivered</hi> to them,<note place="margin">Jude iii.</note> was to exhort and stir them up to a constant continuance in their Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not to suffer themselves, whether by the cunning Artifice of Some, or by the open Violence of Others, to be either totally frightned out of their <hi>Religion,</hi> or to be misled into any <hi>false Doctrines,</hi> contrary to the Truth and Purity which they had been taught.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the <hi>second Chapter,</hi> he speaks of certain <hi>false Teachers</hi> that were crept in amongst them,<note place="margin">V. 1.</note> and made it their great endeavour by any means to bring in <hi>damnable Heresies.</hi> And he foresaw that their wicked Industry would be likely to prove but too fatally succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for, <hi>Many</hi> (says he) <hi>shall follow their pernicious ways,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 2.</note> 
               <hi>by reason of whom the way of Truth shall be evil spoken of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the next <hi>Chapter,</hi> he goes on to foretel the near approach of those <hi>Judgments</hi> which our Saviour Christ had
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59924:66"/>
so often denounced against the <hi>Jews,</hi> and in which those <hi>complying Christians</hi> were in like manner to be involved. And by both these Considerations, he finally, in the <hi>Close</hi> of all, stirs them up, both to a <hi>Care</hi> of themselves, and to a <hi>Constancy</hi> in their Profession;
<q>
                  <p>Ye therefore, <hi>Beloved,</hi> seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also being led away with the <hi>Error of the Wicked,</hi> fall from your own <hi>sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But grow in <hi>Grace,</hi> and in the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ: to Him be Glory both now and for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Such was the occasion of these words; and the prosecution of them at this time will engage Me to explain the nature, and to exhort you to the practice of two <hi>Duties,</hi> than which I know none more proper for our serious Consideration; <hi>Growth in Grace, and Stedfastness in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>; and from both which there are but too many <hi>Seducers</hi> on every hand to turn us aside. I shall pursue both in this following Order.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:59924:67"/>
               <item>I. I will shew you, what the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that <hi>stedfastness</hi> in <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is, to which our <hi>Text</hi> here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts us.</item>
               <item>II. By what <hi>Motives</hi> especially it was, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> stirr'd up the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> to whom he wrote, and that I would now crave leave to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort</hi> you, to such a <hi>stedfastness.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>III. How highly both necessary in its self it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but especially how advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to this great End, that we should all of us endeavour what in us lies, to <hi>grow in Grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>And first,</p>
            <p>I. What the true nature of that <hi>stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> is, to which our <hi>Text</hi> exhorts us, and which I am from thence to recommend to you.</p>
            <p>For 'tis not every <hi>firmness</hi> that deserves the name of a true and rational <hi>stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>: and a man may as well exceed, by a perverse, unwarrantable resolution not to hearken to any <hi>Motives,</hi> tho' ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so reasonable, to change his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59924:67"/>
as by an unfix'd and irresolute tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per abandon himself to <hi>every wind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> that shall come to turn him aside from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Constancy</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> is a Vertue that, like all others, must be regulated by <hi>Prudence.</hi> It must be firm, but it must be well-grounded too. And he who would go about at all adventures to recommend a <hi>perseverance</hi> in that <hi>Faith,</hi> whatever it be, in which a man has been <hi>born</hi> and <hi>bred,</hi> without allowing a just enquiry to be made into the Grounds of it, and even a liberty to forsake it too, should they prove less solid than they ought to be; He may indeed provide for their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity who chance to be already in the right way, but shall render it utterly impossible for those that are not, ever to come to the knowledge of it.</p>
            <p>It is not therefore such a <hi>blind sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastness</hi> as this, a <hi>constancy</hi> in our <hi>Religion</hi> whether it be good or bad, that either the <hi>Apostle</hi> here means, or that I would now recommend to you. This would be to make a plea for <hi>Obstinacy</hi> rather than <hi>Constancy</hi>; whil'st by such a Rule it would be the duty of a <hi>Jew</hi> to remain a <hi>Jew,</hi> a <hi>Heathen</hi> a <hi>Heathen</hi>; for a <hi>Papist</hi> or <hi>Socinian</hi> to continue all their lives <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:59924:68"/>
or <hi>Socinian,</hi> no less than for One of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to be firm and stedfast to the Faith and Communion of it. That which I understand by a true <hi>stedfastness,</hi> is this: When a man is upon rational and good Grounds evidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of his <hi>Religion,</hi> then to resolve to stick close to it, and not suffer any base, unworthy <hi>Motives,</hi> to draw him aside from it. Our <hi>Religion</hi> must first be <hi>well grounded,</hi> and then it will be true <hi>stedfastness</hi> to adhere to it. And therefore to give such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary directions as may suffice for the practice of this <hi>Duty,</hi> I must distinctly consider it in both its respects, and as it stands in the <hi>Middle</hi> between the two <hi>Extremes</hi> of a <hi>blind Obstinacy</hi> on the <hi>one hand,</hi> and of a <hi>weak Instability</hi> on the <hi>other</hi>; and by either of which, the true nature of it will become equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> then: He that will be truly <hi>sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast</hi> in his <hi>Religion,</hi> must take heed that he does not mistake <hi>Obstinacy</hi> for <hi>Stedfastness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is an <hi>Error</hi> so much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be remarked on this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in that a daily experience sadly
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59924:68"/>
shows us at once, both the danger and easiness of such a mistake. It is a strange perverseness in some men, that they make it no less than a <hi>mortal sin</hi> to have any <hi>doubts,</hi> though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so reasonable, of any the least <hi>Doctrine</hi> they have once been taught to profess. And there is hardly an Immorality so heinous and provoking, so contrary to the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and so destructive of Salvation, which their <hi>Spiritual Guides</hi> will not sooner over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, than such a Scruple. Insomuch, that by the express <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> which I am now speaking of, 'tis made a part of mens solemn recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into their <hi>Communion,</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:59924:69"/>This is, in good truth, to make a <hi>Faction</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi>; 'tis a <hi>Combination</hi> rather than a <hi>Constancy</hi>: And what wretched effects it has upon the minds of those unfortunate, deluded men, that have once suffered themselves to be thus engaged, appears in this; That no rational Motives, no Arguments, though never so clear, are almost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to work upon them. The sad <hi>Vow</hi> they have made, recurs continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon their minds: They have <hi>sworn</hi> to continue where they are gone, at all adventures; and therefore they now as obstinately resolve never to return to the Truth, as they once weakly suffered themselves to be sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from it.</p>
            <p>To avoid such an unhappy <hi>Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy</hi> as this, and be <hi>constant</hi> in our <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> upon such rational Grounds as may justifie us before <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> from the charge of a <hi>pertinacious firmness,</hi> we may please to observe these following di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> Let our <hi>Religion</hi> be founded in <hi>Knowledg</hi>; i. e. Let us be clearly and evidently convinced of the <hi>Truth</hi> of that to which we do adhere, and then
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59924:69"/>
we may be sure we cannot be justly charged with <hi>Obstinacy</hi> for our adhering to it.</p>
            <p>He who takes up his <hi>Religion</hi> upon trust, that receives all the <hi>Articles</hi> of his <hi>Creed</hi> by wholesale; <hi>believes</hi> as his <hi>Church believes,</hi> but it may be knows not either what that is, or wherefore he does so; 'tis evident that such a credulous Disciple as this, may be <hi>blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obstinate,</hi> but he cannot be wisely <hi>stedfast</hi> in the Faith. A good Christian must be able to give some more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable account of his Faith than this, if ever he means to be securely firm in the Profession of it. His <hi>Creed</hi> must be founded on some better <hi>Authority</hi> than a bare <hi>Credulity.</hi> And 'twill be a very useless Plea at the last day, that a man <hi>believed</hi> as his <hi>Church believed,</hi> when he might have had the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a better information, should he chance by so doing, to live and dye in a <hi>damnable Heresie</hi>; unless he can render some tolerable account either wherefore his <hi>Church believed</hi> so, or at least, wherefore it was that he submitted himself so servilely to her <hi>Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:59924:70"/>But he that <hi>believes</hi> with <hi>knowledg,</hi> because he is clearly and evidently perswaded that it is the <hi>Truth,</hi> need never fear either the danger or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of such an Obstinacy, for his firmness in adhering to his Faith. If, for instance, a Member of the <hi>Church of England</hi> reads in his <hi>Bible</hi> those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press words of the <hi>Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Thou shalt not make to thy self any</hi> graven Image, <hi>nor the</hi> likeness <hi>of any thing that is in Heaven above,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou shalt not</hi> Bow down <hi>to it, nor</hi> Worship <hi>it</hi>; If he looks forward to the History of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and there in the Institution of the Blessed <hi>Eucharist</hi> sees those words, <hi>Drink ye ALL of this,</hi> in as plain and legible Characters, as those others, <hi>Take</hi> and <hi>Eat</hi>; and thereupon resolves never to be prevailed upon, either to <hi>Bow down himself before an Image,</hi> or to give up his Right to the <hi>Cup</hi> as well as to the <hi>Bread</hi> in that Holy <hi>Sacrament,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever glosses may be made, or preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be used to induce him to either; 'Tis evident that such a <hi>Firmness</hi> as this, cannot be called <hi>Obstinacy,</hi> unless these <hi>Scriptures</hi> be no longer the <hi>Word of God,</hi> or that no longer a Principle
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59924:70"/>
of Scripture, that <hi>in matters of plain and undoubted Command,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts iv.19.</note> 
               <hi>we are to obey God rather than man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in these and the like instances, where the matter is clear even to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, there is no doubt to be made, but that such <hi>Knowledg</hi> will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly secure us against the charge and danger of <hi>Obstinacy.</hi> But because all points in debate are not thus <hi>Evident,</hi> but on the contrary many are not a little obscure; therefore for the securing our selves from danger in our adherence to these too, we must to our <hi>Knowledg</hi> add,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> A sincere <hi>zeal</hi> to <hi>discover</hi> the <hi>truth,</hi> with an affectionate <hi>Charity</hi> to those that differ from us.</p>
            <p>In such Cases as this, thô we must <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> and <hi>profess</hi> according to what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us at present to be the <hi>Truth</hi>; yet since the Evidence is not such as to exclude all possibility of our being mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, our adherence to it must be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified with this reserve, neither <hi>rashly</hi> to <hi>censure</hi> those who are <hi>otherwise minded,</hi> nor <hi>obstinately</hi> to <hi>resolve</hi> never to <hi>change</hi> our <hi>Opinion,</hi> if we should perhaps be hereafter convinced that we ought to do so.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:59924:71"/>Now in order hereunto, it is not necessary that a Man should either <hi>fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> in his <hi>present Faith,</hi> or not be firmly persuaded that he shall never see any reason to forsake it. It is sufficient to take off the imputation of <hi>obstinacy,</hi> that our <hi>stedfastness</hi> be such as not to exclude either a readiness of being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter informed, if that be possible; or of making, upon all occasions, a strict and impartial <hi>enquiry</hi> into the <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> of our Faith; or even of hearing freely whatever <hi>objections</hi> can fairly be brought against it. And all this with a sincere desire, and stedfast resolution to discover and embrace the <hi>Truth,</hi> wheresoever it lies; Whether it be that which we now suppose to be so, or whether it shall be found to be on the contrary side. He who is thus disposed in his mind at all times to <hi>receive instruction,</hi> and never presumes rashly to <hi>condemn</hi> any one that is thus in like manner disposed, however otherwise <hi>disagreeing</hi> in <hi>Opinion</hi> from Him; need never fear that his <hi>firmness</hi> is any other than that Wise and Christian <hi>stedfastness</hi> which our <hi>Text</hi> requires, not such an <hi>obstinacy</hi> as both that and we most justly detest and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:59924:71"/>But here then we must look to the <hi>other extreme,</hi> and take heed, lest for fear of being <hi>perversly constant</hi> to our <hi>Faith,</hi> we fall into a weak and criminal <hi>Instability.</hi> To prevent this, these three things may be consider'd:
<list>
                  <item>1<hi>st.</hi> That we carefully avoid all <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Motives</hi> of changing our <hi>Religion.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2<hi>dly,</hi> That we be not too apt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain an <hi>ill Opinion</hi> of it.</item>
                  <item>3<hi>dly,</hi> That if any <hi>Arguments</hi> shall at any time be brought against it that may deserve our considering; we then be sure to give Them that due and diligent <hi>Examination,</hi> that we ought to do.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I<hi>st,</hi> He that will be <hi>stedfast</hi> in the <hi>Faith,</hi> must above all things take heed to arm himself against all <hi>unworthy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> of <hi>changing</hi> his <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very sad to consider what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian means are made use of by some persons to <hi>propagate</hi> their <hi>Religion:</hi> And a Man need almost no other assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that it cannot be from <hi>God,</hi> than to see the <hi>Professors</hi> of it pursue such <hi>methods</hi> for the promoting of its Interest,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59924:72"/>
as most certainly never came down from above.</p>
            <p>Thus, if a Man's <hi>fortunes</hi> be <hi>mean,</hi> or his <hi>ambition great</hi>; If Religion has not taken so deep root in his Soul as to enable him to overcome the flatteries and temptations of a present <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Advantage</hi>; then there shall not be wanting a <hi>seducer</hi> presently to shew him, that he must needs be out of the right way, because it is not that which leads to <hi>preferment.</hi> And 'tis great odds but a good Place, or an Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Title, will quickly appear a more <hi>infallible mark</hi> of the <hi>true Church,</hi> than any that <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Antiquity</hi> can fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish to the contrary.</p>
            <p>If this will not do, and <hi>Interest</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevail, then the other <hi>governing passion</hi> of our Minds, mens <hi>fears,</hi> are tried. Instead of these allurements, the <hi>False Teacher</hi> now <hi>thunders</hi> out <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Damnation</hi> against us. Nothing but <hi>Curses</hi> and <hi>Anathema</hi>'s to be expected by us if we continue firm in our Faith. And it shall be none of the <hi>Prophets</hi> nor his <hi>Churches</hi> fault, if all the Horrors and Miseries of this present life be not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd against us, in charity, to prevent our falling into the Everlasting Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the next.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:59924:72"/>The Truth is, I am ashamed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what <hi>unworthy means</hi> some have not been ashamed to make use of to <hi>promote</hi> their <hi>Religion,</hi> and draw us away from our stedfastness. <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy, Hungary</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi>; The <hi>Old World</hi> and the <hi>New,</hi> have all, and that but very lately been witnesses what ways it is that <hi>Popery</hi> has, and does, and if ever it means effectually to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, must take to propagate its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest:
<q>—Animus meminisse horret, luctú<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> refugit.</q>
Now he that shall be so unhappy as to suffer himself by any of these <hi>motives,</hi> which a constant Man might and ought to have overcome, to be seduced from the right Faith; he may deserve indeed to be <hi>pitied</hi> now, but I fear he will hardly be hereafter <hi>excused.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is not sufficient to secure our selves against this <hi>danger.</hi> He that will be <hi>constant</hi> in his <hi>Religion,</hi> as he ought to be, must see,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> That he be not too apt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain an <hi>ill Opinion</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>For if it be <hi>Obstinacy</hi> on the one hand, not to admit of any Conviction thò never so clear and reasonable; it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59924:73"/>
a great <hi>Weakness</hi> on the other, to be affrighted at every shadow of an <hi>Argument,</hi> and to put it in the power of every little Disputer to <hi>prejudice</hi> us against our <hi>Religion,</hi> because one who is its professed Enemy, rails against it, and pretends it is a very ill One.</p>
            <p>He would, I believe, be thought a very credulous person indeed, who should begin to stagger and fall into a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, thô he saw himself upon <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>even Ground,</hi> because a bold and fanciful man is very positive that 'tis a <hi>precipice.</hi> And doubtless that Man is no less to be pitied, that is frighted for fear he should be in the wrong, thô he has the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Authority of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,</hi> nay, and even of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> too on his side, as often as every <hi>Common-place Trifler</hi> shall think fit to run over his division upon the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Antiquity, Succession, Infallibility</hi> of it; and, without either Modesty or Proof, call us <hi>Hereticks.</hi> If Men have <hi>Reason</hi> on their side, if they have <hi>Scripture</hi> for what they say, let them on <hi>God</hi>'s Name produce it: We are always ready to consider and to submit to such convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. But otherwise to think to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us that we are in utter darkness
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59924:73"/>
when we see the Sun shining in our faces; That we must be damned for not believing that what we <hi>see,</hi> and <hi>tast,</hi> and know, to be but a bit of <hi>Bread,</hi> is not the <hi>Body of a Man</hi>; That they are not <hi>Infallible,</hi> who are actually involved in the grossest <hi>Errors</hi>; In a word, That our <hi>Church</hi> had no being before <hi>Luther,</hi> every Article of whose Faith is founded upon the Authority of the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and has been professed in all Ages of the <hi>Church</hi> from the <hi>Apostles</hi> to this day; this is certainly one of the most unreasonable things in the whole World, and what ought not by any means to stagger our <hi>stedfastness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now having secured our selves on both these sides, it only remains to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve our Constancy;</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> That if at any time any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments should be offer'd to us that may deserve our regard, we then be sure to give them that due and wise <hi>Examination</hi> that we ought to do.</p>
            <p>It is a very great <hi>Weakness,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a very great <hi>fault</hi> in many persons, that if at any time they begin to doubt in their <hi>belief</hi> of any part of their <hi>Faith</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:59924:74"/>
which they have been taught to <hi>profess,</hi> they presently abandon their own <hi>Guides,</hi> and run for satisfaction to those who are the professed Enemies of their <hi>Religion.</hi> From henceforth they hear nothing but what is ill of their <hi>Church</hi>; they are taught more and more to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the way that they are in; and then 'tis odds but a very little examination suffices to make them leave it.</p>
            <p>This is certainly a very great fault, and will one day prove of very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous consequence. What such persons may think of <hi>changing</hi> their <hi>Religion,</hi> I cannot tell; but sure I am, our greatest Charity will hardly enable us to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any very comfortable Opinion of them. Nor are they such as those that we either say, or believe may be <hi>saved,</hi> notwithstanding the <hi>errors</hi> and <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> with which they Communicate.</p>
            <p>He that will make a safe change from one <hi>Religion</hi> to another, must not think it enough to enquire into one or two <hi>points,</hi> and having received a satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in them, embrace all the rest at a venture for their sakes; but he must pass distinctly through every <hi>Article</hi> in debate. He must enquire, not only
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59924:74"/>
whether the <hi>Church</hi> of which he is at present a Member, be not mistaken in some points, it may be there is no <hi>Church</hi> in the World that is absolutely free from all kind of Error; But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those mistakes be of such a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that he cannot communicate any longer with it on the account of them. When this is done, the greatest diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty will still remain, to examine with the same diligence every <hi>Article</hi> of that other <hi>Church</hi> to which he is tempted: For else, thô he should have reason to forsake his own <hi>Church,</hi> he will yet be but little advantaged if he goes to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is as bad, or, it may be, worse than that. If there he should find the most part well, yet so that there are but any One or Two things so <hi>Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> as to oblige him to <hi>profess</hi> what he thinks to be <hi>false,</hi> or to <hi>practice</hi> what is <hi>unlawful,</hi> even this will be sufficient to hinder him from <hi>reconciling</hi> himself to it. And in all this, there must be a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and diligent, and impartial search. There must be no prejudice in favour of the One, or against the Other; no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that the Truth should be on this side, rather than on that: In short, nothing must be omitted, whereby he might
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59924:75"/>
reasonably have got a better Information. And to all this Care, there must be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded fervent <hi>Prayer</hi> to God for his assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. He who falls away from his <hi>first Faith</hi> on any lesser convicton than this, can never excuse himself from a crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal lightness in a matter of such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. And for him that sincerely does this, I shall, for my part, be content that he should leave the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whenever he can be thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that any other, but especially that the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is a safer way to Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this may suffice to have been said to the first particular; What that <hi>sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastness</hi> in Religion is, to which our <hi>Text</hi> exhorts us. I go on 2<hi>dly</hi> to shew,</p>
            <p>II. Upon what <hi>Motives</hi> it was that the <hi>Apostle</hi> here stirred up the <hi>Christians</hi> to whom he wrote, and that I am now in like manner to exhort you, to such a <hi>stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now these our <hi>Text</hi> reduces to this One General Consideration; That they both understood their danger, and were expresly forewarn'd by his <hi>Epistle</hi> how careful it would behove them to be, to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59924:75"/>
arm themselves against it: <hi>Ye therefore, Beloved, seeing ye know these things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Beware.</hi> And doubtless it is not only a great security, but ought to be also a great engagement to such a vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, to be thus expresly forewarned of our danger. And he who either neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting or despising the Admonition, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers himself to be seduced from his own <hi>stedfastness,</hi> must certainly be utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable both in the sight of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> for his Inconstancy.</p>
            <p>But that which will aggravate this neglect yet much more, is the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of those <hi>Motives</hi> by which the <hi>Apostle</hi> here cautions them to <hi>Beware,</hi> and which therefore I must lay a little more distinctly before you. Now such were especially these two.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> The <hi>dangerousness</hi> of those <hi>sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> that were crept in amongst them: And this not so much in respect of their <hi>cunning</hi> and <hi>diligence,</hi> thô that too were considerable; as of the <hi>motives</hi> they used to draw them from their <hi>sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastness.</hi> There are, it may be, scarce any two things in the World, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and corruption of Man's Nature consider'd, more apt to seduce, than an
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59924:76"/>
               <hi>easie Practice,</hi> supported with <hi>high Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>; when both the way that is offer'd is extremely agreeable to our loose incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and the <hi>Proponent</hi> wonderfully confident in the tender of it; And both these St. <hi>Peter</hi> here tells us, were to be found in the <hi>Hereticks</hi> against whom he forewarns them: And indeed 'twas upon this account especially, that he seemed to be so apprehensive of their prevailing. <hi>For when</hi> (says he) <hi>they speak great swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling words of vanity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">II. Chap. ver. 18.</note> 
               <hi>they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness.</hi> And therefore, as he said before, ver. 2.<note place="margin">—2.</note> 
               <hi>Many shall follow their pernicious,</hi> or rather, as both the Original <hi>Greek,</hi> and our own <hi>Marginal Note</hi> read it, their <hi>loose,</hi> their <hi>lascivious ways.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Another danger there was, and that no less to be considered than the foregoing. The <hi>Christians</hi> to whom he wrote, were under some trial and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for the Faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> and these <hi>Hereticks</hi> who chiefly provided for the ease and quiet of this present life, had found out a remedy against that danger too. They taught, That it was lawful on these occasions to dissemble, or even to deny their Faith, and not to run any such hazards for it. Now this to weak
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59924:76"/>
minds could not but be a strong tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to comply with them. Men, for the most part, are very easie in believing that, which they very much desire should be true. And therefore no wonder if our <hi>Apostle</hi> thought himself highly concern'd amidst all these dangers, to exhort them to <hi>beware, lest being led away with the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the wicked, they should fall from their own stedfastness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such was the state of these <hi>Christians</hi>; and I shall not need to make any Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. But now, if as we have seen their dangers, so we shall also consider the <hi>Arguments</hi> which the <hi>Apostle</hi> here urges to confirm their Constancy, we shall be forced to acknowledge them to be such, as ought in all reason to have prevailed with them. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> As to the <hi>temptations</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, they are indeed but too apt to seduce, because we are few of us so wise or so good as we ought to be: but to an upright and sincere <hi>Christian,</hi> they will appear exceeding inconsiderable, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven detestable. <hi>Confidence</hi> and <hi>Assurance</hi> stagger weak minds: but if destitute of solid reason, they only argue to wise men the vanity of the Undertaker, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59924:77"/>
render the Man and his Cause the more ridiculous. And for the other <hi>dangers,</hi> the <hi>fear of Persecution,</hi> and the <hi>looseness of their Morals</hi>; he must be a strange sort of Christian indeed, whom such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations can prevail with to <hi>fall from his stedfastness,</hi> and hardly worth the while for any Church to get or to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve. And tho' I should be glad by any honest and Christian means to promote the Interests, and enlarge the Borders of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> yet I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that I am so little concern'd for such <hi>Members</hi> as these, that on the contrary I could almost wish that all those who will not be perswaded to live <hi>Christianly</hi> in our <hi>Communion,</hi> would be so kind to us as to live <hi>Vnchristianly</hi> out of it, rather than in it, The loss of Ten thousand such <hi>Proselytes</hi> would only lessen our <hi>number,</hi> but neither our <hi>Honour</hi> nor our <hi>Interest</hi>; nay, perhaps, would rather help to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote both: For I should then begin to hope, that <hi>God</hi> had indeed a Blessing in store for us, could I once see these <hi>Jonas</hi>'s cast out, for whose sake, perhaps, it is that the present <hi>Storm</hi> is fallen upon us; and whose departure from us, may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for ought I know, be the likeliest means to restore to us the Blessing of Peace and Security again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:59924:77"/>But if there be then nothing in these <hi>temptations</hi> that should draw us aside from our <hi>stedfastness,</hi> I am sure,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> There is more than enough in what St. <hi>Peter</hi> here offers, to engage us to continue firm to it. And because I may not now enlarge my self, I will rather point it out to you, than insist upon it. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> It is with <hi>us</hi> now, as it was with the <hi>Christians</hi> in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s time: Those who would draw us away from our <hi>sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastness</hi> to the true <hi>Catholic Faith,</hi> would bring in dangerous, I am unwilling with the <hi>Apostle</hi> to say <hi>damnable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,</hi> in the stead of it. We do indeed charitably hope, That they who by the Providence of God have been born in a <hi>different Communion</hi> from us, and bred up all their lives not only in an utter <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> of the <hi>right Faith,</hi> but in an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable <hi>hatred</hi> to it; who have been taught to <hi>damn</hi> us as <hi>Heretics</hi> and <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics,</hi> and to value themselves upon the score of their own <hi>pretended Catholicism,</hi> if they are otherwise sincere in that Faith which they profess, and repent them truly of their sins, but especially of their <hi>uncharitableness</hi> to those that differ
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59924:78"/>
from them, may, through the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary mercy of God, be saved, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing such their <hi>Errors.</hi> But for us, who know their delusions; that whil'st they <hi>damn</hi> all others as <hi>Hereticks,</hi> they are indeed themselves the most perverse and obstinate that ever were; should we forsake our <hi>Truth,</hi> and go over to them, that little <hi>Argument</hi> so often used on these occasions, That we <hi>confess</hi> men may be saved in <hi>their Church,</hi> but that they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <hi>deny</hi> they can be so in <hi>Ours,</hi> and therefore that it is better to be on <hi>theirs,</hi> i. e. the safer side, would stand us in small stead; and for all this <hi>Sophistry,</hi> we should certainly run a very great hazard of being <hi>damn'd</hi> for <hi>falling away from our own stedfastness.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> A second <hi>Motive</hi> which our <hi>Apostle</hi> here offers to engage us to such a <hi>constancy,</hi> will arise from the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the exceeding great <hi>punishment</hi> that shall be the consequence of such an Apostacy. Now that in this case was so much the more to be consider'd, in that the punishment which St. <hi>Peter</hi> here speaks of, was to fall upon them even in this present world. The <hi>Prophecies</hi> of Christ for the <hi>Destruction</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now just ready to be accomplish'd,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59924:78"/>
and in which the <hi>Apostatizing Christians</hi> were also to be involved. But however, I neither have, nor would desire to have any such prospect with reference to the <hi>Seducers</hi> and their <hi>Proselytes</hi> in our days, whose <hi>Conversion,</hi> tho' I heartily wish, yet, I thank God, I never did, I hope I never shall desire their <hi>Destruction</hi>: yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Argument ought never the less to be consider'd, because it respects only the <hi>Miseries</hi> of <hi>another life.</hi> There is more than enough in the consideration of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Torments,</hi> to move the most indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent person both to consider, and, if it may be, to prevent the enduring of them. And however men may please to put the <hi>Evil Day</hi> far from them, and hope that it shall not, because it is their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest that it should not, too soon overtake them: yet neither can any of us say how soon it may come upon us; and were it at never so great a distance, yet let us but remember that when it does come, it brings an <hi>Eternity</hi> along with it, and we shall be forced to confess, That no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Considerations, how great soever they may seem to be, are yet fit to stand in competition with it.</p>
            <p>He must be a very foolish, or a very necessitous man indeed, that would part
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59924:79"/>
with the certain reversion of a Thousand Pounds a Year, for the obtaining a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Peny. And yet such, or rather God knows infinitely greater, is the folly of that man, who for any secular advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages whatsoever, sells his Soul; and thereby not only loses his title to all the Joys and Glories of Heaven, but exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them for a dreadful Portion of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Brimstone</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p>Blessed Saviour! What is there in all those little Enjoyments men here pursue with so much greediness, that for the sake of them We should <hi>deny Thee,</hi> and that Faith which must save us when we <hi>appear</hi> before thee in <hi>Judgment</hi>! Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold! yet a little while, and there We must stand to render a strict Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all our actions, and <hi>receive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what we have done in the body, whether it be good or evil.</hi> And what then will all these Interests and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages avail us? <hi>What profit shall we then have,</hi> tho' we could have <hi>gain'd the whole World,</hi> when we <hi>shall have lost our own Souls</hi> for the doing of it? How will it then please us, that we have renounc'd our Faith to preserve those little Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are now no more; but the sad punishment of the soul <hi>Apostacy</hi> to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59924:79"/>
which they have tempted us, will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for ever? Certainly, were the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Hypocrite</hi> but capable of reflecting what shall be the end of his <hi>Apostacy</hi>; could he but once think with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Who can dwell with everlasting bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings?</hi> he would need no other motive to convince him of the folly of such <hi>Courtly compliance,</hi> and to keep him from <hi>falling away from his own stedfastness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> But the <hi>Apostle</hi> adds yet another <hi>Motive,</hi> and which having mention'd, I shall conclude. We have seen the <hi>sad,</hi> the <hi>unspeakable,</hi> and what is yet more, the <hi>eternal misery</hi> of him that falls from his <hi>stedfastness.</hi> Could I now represent to you the as infinite Reward of the <hi>constant Christian</hi>; could I delineate to you but a small part of those <hi>Joys</hi> which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for such an One; what an illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Crown of Glory</hi> shall adorn his trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Head to all <hi>Eternity:</hi> I might then hope to have fully accomplish'd the design of this <hi>Exhortation,</hi> and to have effectually secured you against <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away from your stedfastness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is an <hi>Argument</hi> above my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to illustrate. <hi>Eye hath not seen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. II<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.</note> 
               <hi>nor ear heard, nor does it enter into the heart of man to conceive, what God has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59924:80"/>
for them that love him.</hi> We have neither <hi>thoughts</hi> to imagine any thing comparable to its greatness, much less <hi>words</hi> to express it. And methinks even this should be enough to recommend it to us, that we are not able to express it. That its Excellency so far surpasses whatever experience we can pretend to of any <hi>felicity</hi> in <hi>this life,</hi> that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so much as found upon it any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble apprehensions of the <hi>Joys</hi> and Glories of the other. At least, this I am sure, that it ought to be more than enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you, how incomparably more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy our desires and pursuits such a reward of our <hi>firmness</hi> is, than whatsoever can be offered to draw us aside from it.</p>
            <p>And now having shown you both what it is to be truly <hi>stedfast</hi> in our <hi>Faith,</hi> and how great an <hi>Obligation</hi> there lies upon us so to be; what remains, but that I briefly <hi>close</hi> all with the last parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular I proposed to speak to,</p>
            <p>III. How highly <hi>necessary</hi> in its self, but especially how <hi>advantageous</hi> to this great end it is, that we should all of us endeavour what in us lies, <hi>To grow in Grace, and in the Knowledg of our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jesus Christ</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:59924:80"/>I could wish I had some longer time to improve, as I ought, this great and useful <hi>Exhortation.</hi> But I have insisted too long already, and therefore may not enlarge upon it. The <hi>duty,</hi> in short, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to us is <hi>this</hi>; That we should seriously endeavour according to our several opportunities, to <hi>encrease</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day in our <hi>Knowledg and Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel of Christ, and in a suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble practice and performance of it.</hi> And he who truly makes it his business to do this, need never fear <hi>falling away from his stedfastness.</hi> His <hi>Knowledg</hi> will teach him what is the <hi>right way,</hi> and the <hi>Grace</hi> of God rooted in his heart, will establish him, that no <hi>unworthy Considerations</hi> shall ever be able to draw him aside from it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For what concerns the former of these, <hi>Knowledg,</hi> he must understand but very little of the true <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> that is not able at the first sight to discover the illusion of those <hi>false Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> that are at present the most busie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us.</p>
            <p>* <hi>Christianity</hi> is a <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi>: It commands us to <hi>love</hi> and to <hi>do good to all men even our very enemies. To bless them that curse us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. v.44.</note> 
               <hi>to do good to them that hate us, and to pray for those
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59924:81"/>
that despitefully use us and persecute us.</hi> And can those be its Disciples, who scatter nothing but <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>malice, confusion</hi> and <hi>disorder,</hi> whereever they come; and make it a matter of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> to root out and destroy from off the earth, all those that differ from them? The very <hi>foundation</hi> of whose <hi>Religion</hi> consists in a <hi>Maxim</hi> of the most detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uncharitableness, <hi>That all must be damned that are not of their Persuasion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>* <hi>Christianity</hi> is a <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>reasonable Religion</hi>; a <hi>Religion</hi> becoming a most <hi>wise God</hi> to plant, and <hi>rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> to embrace. But our <hi>new Teachers</hi> are for a <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi> Piety: They are for a <hi>Faith</hi> and a <hi>Worship</hi> full of the <hi>greatest contradictions</hi>: And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem the true <hi>Character</hi> of a thorough-pac'd <hi>Believer</hi> to be, to <hi>believe</hi> not only without any <hi>just grounds,</hi> but even <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the common Sense and Reason of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>* <hi>Christianity</hi> is an <hi>honest,</hi> an <hi>upright,</hi> a <hi>sincere Religion</hi>; a <hi>Religion</hi> that requires the greatest <hi>plainness</hi> and <hi>simplicity</hi> in all our <hi>words</hi> and <hi>actions.</hi> And can those be <hi>Christians</hi> who are wholly made up of <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Dissimulation</hi>; who <hi>palliate</hi> the very <hi>Doctrine</hi> they <hi>profess;</hi> deny the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59924:81"/>
very <hi>Articles</hi> of their <hi>Faith,</hi> when it is requisite thereby to seduce men to their Party; and plainly show that they value not what they do or say, as often as the <hi>mother-interest</hi> of their <hi>Church</hi> requires them to <hi>deceive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>* Christianity teahces us to <hi>worship</hi> but <hi>One God</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. ii.5.</note> and <hi>one only Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, Christ Jesus.</hi> But our New-Masters are not thus content: They set up, if not more <hi>Gods,</hi> yet I am sure more <hi>Objects</hi> of their <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> more <hi>Mediators</hi> than <hi>one</hi>; and teach men to address their <hi>Prayers</hi> more frequently through the <hi>Merits</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession</hi> of their <hi>new Advocates,</hi> to whose <hi>Patronage</hi> they have committed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, than through His who is the true <hi>Christians only Advocate, Christ blessed for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>* <hi>Christianity</hi> forbids us to make any <hi>graven Images,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2<hi>d</hi> Com.</note> 
               <hi>the likeness of any thing in Heaven above, to Bow down before it, and worship it.</hi> These <hi>false Prophets</hi> set up their <hi>Images</hi> in every <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>bow down</hi> to the <hi>work</hi> of their <hi>hands.</hi> For this end they <hi>consecrate</hi> them with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Abominations. And however some think fit to dissemble it, yet others speak it boldly out, as the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of their
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59924:82"/>
               <hi>Church,</hi> That <hi>the very same Religious Worship is to be given to the Cross of Christ,</hi>

               <hi>that is paid to Him that suffered upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>* <hi>Christianity</hi> commands us to <hi>pray</hi> in a <hi>tongue</hi> which the <hi>Church understands,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. xiv.</note> 
               <hi>that so the unlearned may be able to say</hi> Amen <hi>at our giving of thanks.</hi> Our <hi>New Guides</hi> direct men to <hi>pray</hi> in a tongue which to be sure the <hi>people</hi> do not, and which sometimes even the <hi>Priest</hi> too that officiates, <hi>understands</hi> as little as they.</p>
            <p>* <hi>Christianity</hi> is a <hi>Religion</hi> that teaches men to be <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>humble, not to think of themselves above what they ought to think; but when they have done all, to say, they are unprofitable servants.</hi> But our <hi>new Teachers have not so learnt of Christ.</hi> They know a little better how to value their own performances. Instead of saying they are <hi>unprofitable servants,</hi> they teach men to value themselves on the account of their <hi>Merits</hi>; to look upon <hi>Heaven</hi> to be but an equal <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence</hi> of their <hi>Piety;</hi> nay, yet more, that they may live so as to make <hi>God</hi> a <hi>Debtor</hi> to them beyond all the <hi>Glories</hi> of <hi>Eternity,</hi> and to <hi>merit</hi> a <hi>Crown</hi> both for <hi>themselves</hi> and <hi>others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:59924:82"/>* In short, for there is indeed no end of the <hi>contradiction; Christianity</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us <hi>to take bread, to bless it, and break it; To take Wine, bless it and pour it out; and eat and drink</hi> at the <hi>Holy Table</hi> in <hi>remembrance of that Death and Passion,</hi> which our <hi>Blessed Saviour once for all</hi> underwent upon the <hi>Cross</hi> for us. But what now do our <hi>new Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors?</hi> They tell us here is neither <hi>Bread</hi> nor <hi>Wine</hi> to be <hi>eaten</hi> or <hi>drunk</hi>; that they are, I know not how, <hi>converted</hi> into the very Natural Substance of <hi>Christ's Body</hi> and <hi>Blood.</hi> That he was not <hi>offered</hi> up <hi>once for all,</hi> but is here again as <hi>truly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered as ever he was upon the Cross</hi>: That thereby a new <hi>Expiation</hi> is made for the <hi>Sins</hi> both of the <hi>dead</hi> and the <hi>living</hi>; and thô our <hi>Saviour</hi> has as expresly commanded <hi>both kinds</hi> as <hi>either,</hi> yet they <hi>declare</hi> that <hi>one</hi> is sufficient for the <hi>people</hi> to <hi>partake</hi> of, and accordingly they give no more to them.</p>
            <p>Thus you see how very little a <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege</hi> of our <hi>Lord</hi> and his <hi>Religion</hi> will suffice to show that there cannot be any just cause for any one to forsake the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> to plunge himself into such an <hi>abyss</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> as this. And then if he be but equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advanced,</p>

               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:59924:83"/>2<hi>dly,</hi> In <hi>Grace</hi> too; this will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly secure him, that no <hi>base motive,</hi> no <hi>danger</hi> or <hi>Interest</hi> shall be able to prevail with him so to do.</p>
            <p>Let the <hi>Seducer</hi> display all the seeming <hi>advantages</hi> of such a <hi>change.</hi> Let him with his <hi>Master</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> set us up upon the <hi>high mountain</hi> of our own vain ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations. There let him shew us all the <hi>Kingdoms of the Earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. iv.8.</note> and the <hi>glories of them</hi>; and to compleat the <hi>Parallel,</hi> let him, if he can, add too; <hi>All these things are mine, and to whomsoever I will, I can give them; if thou wilt therefore</hi> renounce thy Faith, and fall down and <hi>worship me, all shall be thine.</hi> By <hi>Grace</hi> we shall learn to despise them all: This will convince us, that there can be no <hi>true honour</hi> in <hi>dissembling</hi> a mans <hi>conscience,</hi> and prostituting his Soul, his <hi>Religion,</hi> and his <hi>God,</hi> to a little present advantage. That the <hi>Riches</hi> of this world are but <hi>vanity</hi>; that the <hi>true treasure</hi> is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. In a word, That the favour of the greatest <hi>Monarch</hi> is not worth the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing, if to obtain that, we must lose the <hi>favour</hi> of <hi>God</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p>Let him shift the <hi>Scene</hi>; instead of all these <hi>advantages,</hi> let him set forth all the <hi>dangers</hi> that either the <hi>Devil</hi> can suggest,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59924:83"/>
or his own more furious <hi>Zeal</hi> invent; By <hi>Grace</hi> we shall be able to <hi>despise</hi> even those too. This will teach us, that there is a <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> who shall <hi>laugh them to scorn</hi>; and <hi>whose Counsel</hi> it is, that when all is done, <hi>shall stand.</hi> That if he pleases to <hi>protect</hi> us, 'tis not all their <hi>malice</hi> that can do us the least injury. But that should he either for our <hi>Punishment,</hi> or our <hi>Trial,</hi> expose us to their rage, yet still we ought with <hi>Moses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. xi.25, 26.</note> 
               <hi>to esteem the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Christ beyond all the treasures of Egypt; and chuse rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the brave resolution of the Saints of old; <hi>They were tortured,</hi>

               <hi>that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the

            <p>Here then let us exercise our selves.

            <p>AS the <hi>context</hi> at first sight tells us, that the Person here spoken of, was St. <hi>Paul</hi>; so if we look into the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59924:86"/>
foregoing <hi>Chapter,</hi> we shall find that he had been not long before sent down from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to <hi>Caesarea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts xxiii. v. 23, &amp;c.</note> by the <hi>chief Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Claudius Lysias,</hi> upon a discovery that had been made to him of certain <hi>Jews</hi> who had <hi>bound themselves under a great</hi> Curse,<note place="margin">Ib. v. 12, 14, 16.</note> 
               <hi>not to Eat nor Drink till they had slain Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was none of the least instances of the blind and furious <hi>zeal</hi> of those men for their Religion, that as they thought themselves disengaged even from all the Common Offices of Humanity to those that were not of the same <hi>Country</hi> and <hi>Opinion</hi> with themselves; so here they look'd upon it to be a piece of merit, <hi>a doing of God service,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. xvi.2.</note> by any the most base and treacherous means that could be imagined, to persecute and destroy this Holy Man, meerly for having <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statized</hi> from it.</p>
            <p>They saw the mischief that he did them, and they knew not how, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than by his death, to prevent it. His <hi>Quality,</hi> his Education <hi>at the feet</hi> of one of their most Learned <hi>Rabbins</hi>; the zeal he once had for the <hi>Jewish worship</hi> in opposition to that to which he was now converted; His indefatigable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry in every where drawing others
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59924:86"/>
out of those Errors and Prejudices in which Himself had been engaged; In a word, that Astonishing <hi>Miracle,</hi> by which our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> himself from Heaven wrought his Conversion; All these, as they rendred him a most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and blessed <hi>Instrument</hi> of propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Gospel,</hi> so did they in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mark him out as a peculiar object of their Rage. And accordingly we find that they left no Method, whether of open Violence, or private Treachery; either by false Accusation, or secret As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassination, unattempted to destroy Him.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was not to be overcome by the <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of <hi>Men.</hi> And our Blessed <hi>Lord,</hi> who so wonderfully called him to his work, did not cease as wonderfully to protect and defend him in it: So that after all their endeavours to entrap him, we find him here more safe than ever from their Violence: In the hands of a <hi>Centurion,</hi> to secure Him from their Malice,<note place="margin">Acts xxiv.23.</note> but not to forbid <hi>any of his acquaintance</hi> to come or <hi>minister unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this state was our <hi>Apostle</hi> when <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> sent for Him to hear what he could say concerning the <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Gospel</hi> of<note place="margin">—v.24.</note>

But the sum of it is recorded in the Words of my <hi>Text, viz.</hi> That it was of <hi>Righteousness, Temperance,</hi> and the <hi>Judgment to come:</hi> And those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to him in so plain and powerful a manner, that he was not able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the impression it made upon him,

            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> That to this man St. <hi>Paul</hi> proposes the Doctrine of a <hi>Future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and that dreadful punishment which by consequence should hereafter be pronounced against <hi>sinners,</hi> not by way of <hi>Authority,</hi> or as a <hi>Revelation</hi> which the <hi>Gospel</hi> had made to the World; but as a point which his own <hi>Reason</hi> would tell him was most just, and fit to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believed. <hi>He reason'd,</hi> says my <hi>Text,</hi> before him, of the great obligations that lye upon Men to live <hi>justly</hi> and <hi>soberly,</hi> and of the severe enquiry that shall one day pass upon all of us, whether we have lived or no as we ought to do. And then taking of our <hi>Text</hi> under these <hi>Considerations,</hi> I suppose I shall pursue the most proper design of it, in discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to you on these <hi>four</hi> points:
<list>
                  <item>I<hi>st.</hi> That the Doctrine of a <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come,</hi> is so highly <hi>reasonable,</hi>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:59924:88"/>
that the greatest <hi>Infidel</hi> must be forced to confess the probability of it.</item>
                  <item>II<hi>dly,</hi> That if there be a <hi>Judgment to come,</hi> and a future <hi>state</hi> of <hi>rewards</hi> and <hi>punishments,</hi> it cannot be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but that those who <hi>live wickedly</hi> now, shall then be in a most wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deplorable condition.</item>
                  <item>III<hi>dly,</hi> That however <hi>sinners</hi> may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to dissemble their <hi>belief</hi> of this, and live as if indeed they did believe nothing at all of it; yet the greatest of them cannot chuse but <hi>tremble</hi> sometimes at the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of it.</item>
                  <item>Thô now, IV<hi>thly</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> It too often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to such persons, as we see it did to this unfortunate Man here; That the effect of these <hi>terrors</hi> is not to bring them to repentance of their <hi>sins</hi>; but to engage them by any means to put off the thoughts of their <hi>future state,</hi> which are so troulesome and amazing to them.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But before I enter upon these Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, there is one thing which I cannot
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59924:88"/>
but observe with reference to those other <hi>points</hi> mention'd in the <hi>Text,</hi> as part of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Discourse before <hi>Felix, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> and <hi>Temperance:</hi> And the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication whereof may serve to reproach the Complaisance of too many of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors among us in the <hi>Gospel</hi>; whose ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness in reproving the Vices of Great Men, and sometimes even their conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance at them, do's but very illy agree ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that great Obligation which our <hi>Holy profession</hi> lays upon us, or with that admirable <hi>Example</hi> which the <hi>Apostle</hi> has here set us for our imitation.</p>
            <p>It is the Character which Historians have given us of this <hi>Felix,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Josephus,</hi> Hist. l. 20.</note> That he was a man, who, in his <hi>Government,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged his Power with all the Violence and Injustice that can possibly be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined; and breaking through all the Ties of Justice and Continence, had, by the help of one <hi>Simon</hi> a <hi>Magician,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tacitus,</hi> Hist. l. 5.</note> gain'd the Affections of <hi>Drusilla,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Azis,</hi> King of the <hi>Emisseni</hi> and lived in a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Adultery</hi> with her.</p>
            <p>Now this being the Case of <hi>Felix,</hi> 'tis plain, that the Subject of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Discourse was to remonstrate to him his <hi>Injustice,</hi> and <hi>Intemperance</hi>; and let him freely know, That however he might
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59924:89"/>
carry it out by his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> now, yet there was a time coming, a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Judgment,</hi> when he should be called to a severe Account for all his Wickedness.</p>
            <p>This was indeed an Address becoming the <hi>zeal</hi> of an <hi>Apostle,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And too plainly shews, how little we have left in us of that <hi>Primitive</hi> warmth which inflamed this Holy Man, by our different management on the like Occasions.</p>
            <p>There can hardly be imagined any greater discouragement to such a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, than what our <hi>Apostle</hi> here la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd under. To touch an <hi>Vnjust Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor</hi> in the point of his <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Injustice</hi>; a <hi>lustful Adulterer</hi> in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his <hi>Incontinence,</hi> this one would think should have been a pretty bold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking for any One. But for Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> a <hi>Prisoner,</hi> one that was to appear as a <hi>Criminal</hi> before him; for him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of flattering this great Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as his Adversary <hi>Tertullus</hi> had done: <hi>Verse</hi> 2. Instead of Applauding the <hi>great quietness which the people enjoy'd under his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 2.</note> 
               <hi>and the very worthy deeds that had been done by his providence,</hi> to call him to repent of his <hi>Rapine</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi>; of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59924:89"/>
his <hi>Intemperance</hi> and <hi>Adultery:</hi> and this too in the presence of that very <hi>Woman</hi> whom he much loved,<note place="margin">Verse 24.</note> and for whose sake he had done so many vile things; this was an Honest freedom and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, becoming an <hi>Apostolical Age</hi>; but which, I fear, in these days of ours, would be censur'd as rudeness, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion; any thing rather than a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable <hi>Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Salvation</hi> of <hi>Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas! St. <hi>Paul</hi> had not learnt that tender Application that is now a-days made to Great Persons. He had no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of his own to pursue; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did not address himself after the manner of those who are more afraid of <hi>offending Men,</hi> than of <hi>displeasing God,</hi> and of <hi>disparaging</hi> their <hi>Character.</hi> He knew the Doctrine to be seasonable to <hi>Felix</hi>; and that if he pleased to make a good use of it, it might be profitable too: And he never stood to consider, whether <hi>Felix</hi> would like it, or no; or whether it might not perhaps provoke him to run to any Extremities against him for his freedom. In short, He had an <hi>Vnjust, Adulterous Man</hi> to preach to; and he knew nothing so fit to <hi>reason</hi> of before him, as of <hi>Righteousness, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:59924:90"/>
and the <hi>Judgment to come.</hi> And had we but the same honest Courage and Indifference that he had, we should speak, not only with the same freedom that he did; but, by the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> with the same efficacy too: And <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>despicable</hi> as we are thought by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yet in the power of that Divine Truth which we are sent to preach to the World, make the greatest Sinners <hi>tremble</hi> to think, <hi>That for all these things God will bring them to judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that this is the Case, is the first thing I am to shew:</p>
            <p>I<hi>st,</hi> That the Doctrine of a <hi>Judgment to come,</hi> is so highly reasonable, that the greatest <hi>Infidel</hi> cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the probability of it.</p>
            <p>In pursuance of which Point, it is not my Design to shew what Grounds the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> give us for the belief of a future Judgment, which we all of us every day profess as an <hi>Article</hi> of our <hi>Faith,</hi> and therefore cannot be supposed any of us to doubt of it. What else do we meet with almost throughout the <hi>New Testament,</hi> but Exhortations to live well upon this <hi>Ground, That God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59924:90"/>
a day in which he will</hi> judge <hi>the world in righteousness:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts xvii.31. Rom. xiv.10.</note> Acts xvii.31. <hi>That we must all stand before the</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-seat <hi>of Christ,</hi> Rom. xiv.10. <hi>That we must</hi> All <hi>appear before the</hi> Judgment-seat <hi>of Christ; Every one to receive the things done in his Body, according to what he hath done, whether it be Good or Evil:</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v.10.<note place="margin">2 Cor. v.10.</note> What <hi>Revelation</hi> has there ever been more clearly made, I do not say than this, That there shall be a final <hi>Judgment,</hi> but of the manner and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of it?<note place="margin">1 Thess. iv.15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. xv.</note> How <hi>the Trumpets shall sound, and the dead arise, and those that are alive be changed.</hi> How the <hi>just</hi> shall be <hi>caught up into the air,</hi> and the <hi>sinners</hi> lie groveling below, in vain cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out <hi>to the Mountains to fall upon them, and to the Hills to cover them:</hi> How <hi>the Judgment shall be set, and the Books open'd, and every man judged out of the things contained in those Books, according to his works.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. xxv.31, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Then shall the Son of Man come in his Glory, and sit down upon the Throne of his Glory: And before him shall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered all Nations, and he shall separate them the one from the other, as a Shepherd divideth his</hi> Sheep <hi>from the</hi> Goats: <hi>and he shall set his Sheep on his</hi> right hand, <hi>and the</hi> Goats <hi>on his</hi> left: <hi>And he shall
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59924:91"/>
say to them on his</hi> right hand, <hi>Come ye Blessed of my Father, inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for you from the foundation of the World. But to those on the</hi> left, <hi>Depart from me ye Cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. And</hi> these <hi>shall go away into</hi> Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Punishment; <hi>but the</hi> Righteous <hi>into Life</hi> Eternal.</p>
            <p>In a word; So particular is the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which we here find of all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of this <hi>great Audit,</hi> that I scarce know any thing left unrevealed to us, but only the <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Hour</hi> when this <hi>Judgment</hi> shall be: And which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God has in Mercy kept up from us, that so we might always live in Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of that, which we can never tell how soon it may arrive.</p>
            <p>But this is not that which my <hi>Text</hi> leads me to consider: And indeed, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be useful enough to call upon the most faithful Christians to think sometimes on this <hi>future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; yet it would certainly be a very needless undertaking to <hi>reason</hi> with such Persons concerning it, and use any long Arguments to convince them of the <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity</hi> of it. That which I have now to do, is of a quite different nature; 'Tis
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59924:91"/>
to offer such Reasons for the belief of a <hi>Judgment to come,</hi> as may convince the Greatest <hi>Infidel</hi> of the <hi>probability</hi> of it: And shew them that, whether they will believe us in other things, or no, yet here at least they cannot with any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son doubt of the Truth of our Doctrine; but must resolve to become <hi>Good Men,</hi> if they will not be persuaded to become <hi>Faithful Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed in this <hi>Sceptical Age,</hi> in which we now live, it may not, for ought I know, be altogether unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to argue sometimes with Men upon their <hi>own Principles.</hi> To shew them, that Religion is not a <hi>contrivance</hi> of <hi>State Policy,</hi> nor the <hi>effect</hi> of <hi>Priest-craft.</hi> That when we discourse of <hi>another World</hi> after this, and a <hi>final Inquest</hi> to pass upon all our Actions; and a <hi>Vast Eternity</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> and <hi>Punishments,</hi> according to what they now do, whether <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi>; we do not alarm Mens minds with false Fears, and ungrounded Terros, but speak to them a <hi>Truth</hi> which the very <hi>Gentiles</hi> themselves have universally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; nay, which their own <hi>Consciences</hi> will not suffer them to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, however they may sometimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to stifle their Convictions, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59924:92"/>
have the Impudence to deny, what at the same time, with <hi>Felix,</hi> they trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think of. In short; That whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we look into the frame and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of our own <hi>Souls</hi> within us, or contemplate the <hi>Dispensations</hi> of <hi>God's Providence</hi> in the affairs of the <hi>World</hi> without, they both speak to us this great Truth, That <hi>God will bring us to Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. If first we look back into the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of the <hi>Heathen Theology,</hi> what point shall we find more universally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by them, than this of a <hi>Judgment to come?</hi> This we may see il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated not only in the flights of their <hi>Poets,</hi> in the Harangues of their <hi>Orators,</hi> in the Dictates of their <hi>Philosophers</hi>; and all which have been particularly collected by the Holy <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in their Writings against them, and may be seen at large in the <hi>Works</hi> yet extant of <hi>Justin Martyr, Eusebius, Theodoret</hi> and others: But as <hi>Tertullian</hi> well observes, even in their common Conversation, in which Men usually the most speak according to their <hi>Natural impressions,</hi> they still testified the same belief: And by <hi>calling God</hi> to <hi>witness</hi> and <hi>judge</hi> of their <hi>Actions</hi>; by commending
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59924:92"/>
themselves and their Cause to <hi>God,</hi> when they could find no remedy or relief from Men, they plainly shew'd it to be a <hi>principle</hi> rooted in their very <hi>Natures,</hi> That there is a <hi>God</hi> who sees and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves what passes here below; and will one day set to rights all the present seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing irregular dispensations of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Government of the World, and <hi>render to every man according to his Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not in this place enter so far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this <hi>Argument,</hi> as to shew you in the particular expressions of the Ancient <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> themselves, how clearly and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily they have deliver'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as to this Point of a <hi>Judgment to come.</hi> But thus much I suppose I may take the liberty to conclude from what I have already in <hi>General</hi> observed; That it cannot be deni'd, but that, <hi>Christianity</hi> set apart, the belief of a <hi>future Judgment</hi> must be allow'd, even upon the meer <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> to be very highly probable, which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> themselves, without the help of any Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have so firmly and universally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>And indeed so clear are the Evidences of it, that wheresoever we turn our eyes,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59924:93"/>
whether into the Nature and Constitution of the <hi>little World</hi> within, or into the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Administration of the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> without us, we cannot but acknowledg the reasonableness of this belief. For,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> If we consider the <hi>Nature</hi> of our own <hi>Souls</hi> within us, we shall find a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> even in the most wicked Men, that will plainly bear <hi>witness</hi> to this great <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a certain Principle implanted in every one of us, that not only <hi>directs</hi> and <hi>informs</hi> us what we ought to do, and what to avoid; but does moreover <hi>check,</hi> or <hi>encourage</hi> us, according as what we have done is either Good or Evil. Now upon this Sentence which our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi> here pass upon all our <hi>Actions,</hi> we find either a <hi>pleasure,</hi> and <hi>confidence,</hi> and <hi>satisfaction</hi> if we have done well; or else a <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>terrour,</hi> and <hi>distrust,</hi> if we have done <hi>ill:</hi> And this not with reference to any <hi>Reward</hi> we are like to receive, or any <hi>Punishment</hi> we may be in danger of suffering in this <hi>present World:</hi> The greatest <hi>Monarchs</hi> being no less sensible of these <hi>Motions</hi> within, when their <hi>Consciences</hi> do either <hi>approve</hi> or <hi>condemn</hi> them, than the meanest of their <hi>Subjects</hi>; and both the One and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59924:93"/>
the other, tho' the <hi>Action</hi> were never so secret, no less than if it had been done in the presence of the whole World.</p>
            <p>And what is all this but a plain <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> planted in our very Nature, to keep us in a continual expectation of some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be given of our <hi>Actions</hi> in another <hi>World,</hi> beyond what is done in this. When the long Series of our present Lives shall be reviewed, and our <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> now our <hi>Judges,</hi> then become <hi>Witnesses,</hi> and give Testimony for or against us, according as we have done either <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which will be a yet farther Confirmation of this Argument is, That the nearer we approach to our latter End, still the more Powerful and Vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous are these impressions of our own <hi>Consciences</hi> upon our Souls. How does the <hi>Sinner</hi> then begin with Horror to reflect upon his Life past; and to hate and fear the Consequence of his Evil doings, when he is just ready to die, and by consequence is passed all appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of any farther inquest in this Life, more than he did at the time of his commission of them? Whilst the Good and Vertuous man embraces Death with such a Quiet and Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59924:94"/>
and oftentimes with such a sensible Joy and Satisfaction, as if he were about to receive some great Good by it, to be sure did not Fear any Evil from it.</p>
            <p>This certainly can be nothing else but a still more sensible evidence of the <hi>Belief</hi> of a <hi>Judgment to come,</hi> rooted in our very <hi>Natures,</hi> and that there is to be a <hi>Restitution</hi> of <hi>rewards</hi> and <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> in <hi>another Life,</hi> besides what is made to our <hi>Actions</hi> in this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. To all which if we add, 3<hi>dly,</hi> The farther strength that will be given to this Principle, from the Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>present Irregular Dispensations</hi> of <hi>God's Providence,</hi> as they seem to us, in <hi>this World,</hi> to oblige us to expect some <hi>Judgment</hi> in the <hi>Other;</hi> I do not see what the greatest <hi>Sceptick</hi> can have to oppose against so firm and clear a <hi>Demonstration</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>It is, I presume, agreed among all sorts of Persons that admit the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>God,</hi> that as he is the <hi>Author</hi> of all <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> in all <hi>other things,</hi> so he can have nothing <hi>Defective,</hi> or <hi>Imperfect</hi> in <hi>Himself.</hi> That as this <hi>World</hi> was not at first <hi>made</hi> by <hi>Chance</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> but by a most <hi>Wise,</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Powerful God</hi>; so neither is it now <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:59924:94"/>
by <hi>Chance,</hi> but by the <hi>Providence</hi> of the same <hi>God</hi> who first <hi>made</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Now if God be Infinitely <hi>Perfect,</hi> then he must be <hi>Perfectly Wise,</hi> and <hi>Just,</hi> and <hi>Good</hi>; and we may as well suppose him not to be <hi>God,</hi> as not allow him to be all this. But if he be so, and if this World be indeed subject to the Guidance of his <hi>Providence,</hi> then We must of necessity acknowledg a <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come.</hi> It being plain, that as the Affairs of men are order'd in this <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent World,</hi> they shew but very little sign of an exact <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> in the Administration of them. The best Men now being oftentimes the most Unfortunate; and the most Profligate Miscreants, the most happy, in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of the Good things of this Life.</p>
            <p>Either therefore we must deny that there is a <hi>God,</hi> altogether; or that the <hi>world</hi> is <hi>Govern'd</hi> by Him: Or we must say, that he is not <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore minds not what becomes of those that are so, which is in effect to say he is not <hi>God</hi>: Or else that he is <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> and <hi>Ignorant</hi>; either does not <hi>know</hi> how things pass here below, or tho' he
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59924:95"/>
does <hi>know,</hi> yet is not able to redress them; and this again destroys the very <hi>Notion</hi> of a <hi>God,</hi> which includes an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Perfection</hi> in <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> no less than in <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi>: Or lastly, If there be a <hi>God,</hi> and that <hi>God</hi> does take care of the Affairs of men; and is <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Just</hi>; and has such a <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> as we say he has; then it must remain, that there shall be a <hi>future Judgment,</hi> in which all these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, irregular Dispensations of his Providence, as they appear to us, shall be cleared and set right, and the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad</hi> receive the just recompence of what their Actions here have deserved.</p>
            <p>Seeing then we cannot with any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son doubt either that there is a <hi>God,</hi> or that this <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Just,</hi> or that his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> does indeed <hi>superintend</hi> over the <hi>Affairs</hi> of the <hi>World</hi>; and yet 'tis plain that things now are not order'd with so <hi>exact</hi> a <hi>Justice</hi> as a <hi>Divine Providence</hi> does require: It must remain, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we with any reason doubt, but that there is to be a <hi>Judgment to come,</hi> in which <hi>God</hi> will make a perfect Demonstration of his <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> to every man according to what he has done in the <hi>Body,</hi> and of which our
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59924:95"/>
               <hi>Consciences,</hi> as we have before shown, shall then render a most exact account.</p>
            <p>Which being so; I shall not need say much to shew,</p>
            <p>II<hi>dly.</hi> That then it cannot be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but those who <hi>live Wickedly now,</hi> must expect to be <hi>hereafter</hi> in a most <hi>wretched</hi> and <hi>deplorable condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the plain, indeed the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Consequence of the foregoing <hi>Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi> For if the very End of this <hi>Judgment</hi> be, as we have said, to make a great and Eternal Demonstration of <hi>God's Justice</hi> in his Dispensations towards the Children of men, then in the words of St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> ii.6.<note place="margin">Rom. ii.6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>He must render to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man according to his works. To them who by Patient Continuance in will doing, seek for Glory, and Honour, and Immortality,</hi> Eternal Life: Tribulation <hi>and</hi> Anguish <hi>upon every Soul of man that does Evil, of the</hi> Jew <hi>first, and also of the</hi> Gentile: <hi>For there is no respect of persons with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the present Administration of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in this Life, be not exactly accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the strict rules of Equity and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; <hi>God</hi> permitting the <hi>Righteous man</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:59924:96"/>
to struggle under the <hi>Pressures</hi> of an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Fortune,</hi> and the <hi>Wicked</hi> and <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly</hi> to <hi>Prosper</hi> in their <hi>Wickedness</hi>; yet may this be very well Reconcilable with his <hi>Justice,</hi> both because he may have other excellent Ends, to serve by such an <hi>Irregularity,</hi> and for that he has yet an Opportunity remaining in his hands, abundantly to <hi>recompence</hi> all the <hi>sufferings</hi> of the <hi>One,</hi> and to <hi>Punish</hi> all the <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness</hi> of the <hi>Other.</hi> And instead of concluding from these <hi>Promiscuous events</hi> now, that <hi>God</hi> is not <hi>Just,</hi> or does not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi> the <hi>Affairs</hi> of this <hi>World</hi>; that he <hi>knows</hi> not, neither <hi>understands</hi> how things pass here below, nor has <hi>power</hi> suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to <hi>Govern</hi> them as in Justice he ought to do; I have already shown that we ought rather to infer, That this Life is only a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Tryal,</hi> that the great time of <hi>Retribution</hi> remains in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother World, when all these Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities shall be set right, and the <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> the <hi>Justice,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> be made known in a most severe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act <hi>Sentence</hi> which shall then pass upon every man, <hi>in the day when he shall judge the World in Righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if <hi>God</hi> not only suffers the <hi>Wicked</hi> to <hi>Flourish now,</hi> but shall <hi>hereafter</hi> also
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59924:96"/>
let them go <hi>Vnpunish'd</hi>; if he permits them to <hi>enjoy</hi> the <hi>Fruits</hi> of their <hi>Sins</hi> in this <hi>present World</hi>; and will take no Care to avenge himself upon them in the next;<note place="margin">Gen. xviii.25.</note> How then <hi>shall the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi> Or what is there more remaining whereby to <hi>justify God in his doings,</hi> who thus apparently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nives at <hi>Sinners</hi>; and neither asserts his Cause in their ruine here, nor will call them to any account for all their Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness hereafter?</p>
            <p>It remains therefore, that as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Just,</hi> and therefore must some time or other <hi>render to every man according to his works,</hi> the Sinner shall one day receive a <hi>dreadful Sentence</hi> of Horror and Misery from that <hi>God,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whose <hi>Knowledge</hi> he can escape, nor whose <hi>Power</hi> he is able to withstand: Who sees all his most secret Villanies now, and will hereafter <hi>bring him to Judgment</hi> for them. But now what or how great that <hi>Punishment</hi> is which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for <hi>Sinners</hi> in the other World, this is what we cannot pretend by any <hi>Natural way</hi> of <hi>Reasoning</hi> precisely to define. And yet thus much I think even our own <hi>Reason</hi> may suggest to us.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:59924:97"/>I<hi>st.</hi> That it must be some very great <hi>Punishment</hi> which a <hi>long Life</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Impiety,</hi> and that too heightned with all the Aggravating Circumstances of being committed against <hi>Knowledge,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>checks</hi> of our <hi>Consciences</hi> to the contrary, it may be against <hi>Vows</hi> and <hi>Resolutions</hi> of doing better; nay possibly, against many special means and methods of <hi>God's Providence</hi> to bring us to <hi>Repentance,</hi> must deserve, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all probability shall receive.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> That as there are different <hi>Kinds</hi> and <hi>Degrees</hi> of <hi>Sinners</hi> now; All men do not rise up to an equal pitch of <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,</hi> nor <hi>begin</hi> so <hi>soon,</hi> nor <hi>continue</hi> so <hi>long</hi> in their Evil doings; nor it may be have it in their Power to do so much mischief as other <hi>Sinners</hi> do; so in all reason we may believe that there shall also be different <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Punishment</hi> suitable to all these, and some be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to a much more Severe and intollerable infliction than others.</p>
            <p>To both which remarks I cannot tell, whether I may not add,</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> That seeing the <hi>Soul</hi> is a <hi>Spirit</hi> in its own nature capable of <hi>Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>; having neither any dependance on the <hi>Body,</hi> nor being exposed to any
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59924:97"/>
of those Casualties that are the <hi>Causes</hi> of the <hi>Corruption</hi> of all other things which we see <hi>Decay</hi> and <hi>Perish</hi> here; and there being no Declaration any where made to us, that it is the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God</hi> ever to <hi>extinguish</hi> them after they are gone out of the <hi>Body</hi>; We may, I think, have some cause to fear, whether our <hi>Souls</hi> being capable of an <hi>Eternal existence,</hi> the <hi>Puishment</hi> also which in that <hi>last Judgment</hi> they shall be doom'd to, may not be for all <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all this the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reason,</hi> and the <hi>Dictates</hi> of our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi> direct us to, and the greatest <hi>Infidel</hi> must be forced at least to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the <hi>Probability</hi> of it. And indeed, However Wicked men may endeavour to dissemble their <hi>Belief</hi> of these things, and live so as if they truly did not give the least credit to them, yet are their <hi>Fears</hi> many times too strong for them, and discover their Apprehensions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no. This is the next <hi>Point</hi> I proposed,</p>
            <p>III<hi>dly.</hi> That however <hi>Sinners</hi> may Live as if they <hi>Believed</hi> nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f all this, yet the greatest of them
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59924:98"/>
cannot chuse but <hi>Tremble</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at the Appprehension of it.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Felix</hi> did, and so we have been told of many others that have done likewise. Men may pretend to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brave <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Eternity</hi> at a distance, may laugh at our Discourses concerning <hi>another World,</hi> and the <hi>Judgment</hi> that is to pass on <hi>all</hi> our <hi>Actions</hi> in it; and make it a Piece of <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Gallantry</hi> not to believe any thing of them; But I have seldome heard of that man that could look <hi>Damnation</hi> in the face when he came within prospect of it. There is a certain time when all men begin to acknowledge the Power of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if not to believe a <hi>Heaven,</hi> yet at least to fear a <hi>Hell. Atheism</hi> and <hi>Profaneness</hi> are things that pass well enough while there is no great cause to reflect on the danger of them: Whilst mens <hi>Pulse</hi> beats <hi>strong,</hi> their Years run <hi>briskly</hi> on; their <hi>Condition</hi> is <hi>Easie</hi> and <hi>Prosperous</hi>; they go on in their sins without Controul, and therefore without considering either what they do, or whether they are running.</p>
            <p>But no sooner does any Trouble and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59924:98"/>
Adversity come upon them: If their <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity</hi> fails them, and the <hi>iniquity of their ways</hi> begins <hi>to encompass them round about;</hi> If <hi>age</hi> and <hi>infirmities</hi> call upon them to think what they have done, or where 'tis they must next go; but presently all their <hi>Schemes</hi> and <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses</hi> vanish: They awake as Men out of a deep sleep, and too late begin, if not to convince themselves that there is a <hi>Judgment to come,</hi> yet to <hi>tremble</hi> with <hi>horror,</hi> lest perhaps there should be <hi>One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas! What is for the most part the <hi>consequence</hi> of these <hi>Terrors?</hi> Is it even now at least to fit and prepare themselves for it? No, They are afraid of a <hi>future judgment,</hi> and cannot endure the thoughts of it; yet still they neglect to provide against it. This was the last <hi>point</hi> I proposed to consider, and is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the sad condition of many of these Men: <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV<hi>thly,</hi> That the use they make of these <hi>reasonings</hi> concerning a <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come,</hi> is not to bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thereby to a <hi>repentance</hi> of their <hi>Evil-doings</hi>; but rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by any means to put off
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59924:99"/>
these thoughts of their <hi>future state,</hi> that are so <hi>troublesome</hi> and <hi>uneasy</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>There is not perhaps any one thing in the World that ruins more Souls, than this unhappy <hi>Method</hi> so common with most <hi>sinners,</hi> of still putting off the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of Religion to a more <hi>convenient season.</hi> They cannot endure the thoughts of <hi>another World,</hi> and that <hi>Judgment</hi> which we must every one of us undergo in it; They <hi>tremble</hi> at the reflection of it, and delude themselves with a <hi>future prospect</hi> of resolving in good earnest to prepare themselves for it; but like <hi>Felix</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> they put off this work to <hi>another Time,</hi> without ever fixing when that <hi>Time</hi> is to come; and it happens to them, as it did to him, that for the most part it never comes at all.</p>
            <p>I believe there are but few in the World so wicked as never to have had their <hi>lucid intervals</hi> of Piety and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; nor occasions both to consider of a <hi>Judgment to come,</hi> and how much it would import them to provide for it. On the contrary, I am apt to think the greatest part of <hi>Sinners</hi> go on in their <hi>sins</hi> now, with a confidence and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59924:99"/>
of <hi>repenting</hi> some time or other: But still some thing or other interposes to prevent their doing of it; and <hi>Death</hi> overtakes them before they are aware; and they go out of this World or ever they have made the least provision for another.</p>
            <p>I shall not need to say how unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able such a <hi>procrastination</hi> is, even upon those <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Natural Reason</hi> on which I have hitherto proceeded in the managing of this <hi>great Argument.</hi> For if we have so much <hi>reason</hi> as we have seen, to believe that there is to be a <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come,</hi> in which we must render a strict account of all our Actions; and every days experience convinces us of the shortness and uncertainty of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent life, and the little depend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce we can make upon it for the time to come: If in that <hi>judgment</hi> the state and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>sinners</hi> shall, without controversy, be very grievous; and there be no way to promise our selves either any peace of <hi>Conscience</hi> now, or any hopes of <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> hereafter, but only by acting in such a manner, and putting our selves in such a state, that we need not be either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to live, or afraid to die: It must then certainly be most fit and reasonable
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59924:100"/>
for all of us to begin personally to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and do like Men, and no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in those <hi>sins</hi> which are our torment now, and which, should we chance to die ere we have repented of them, will prove our ruin for ever.</p>
            <p>And all this the very <hi>light of reason,</hi> and the <hi>dictates</hi> of <hi>natural Conscience</hi> speak to us to call us to <hi>repentance,</hi> and to convince us of the <hi>Danger</hi> and <hi>Vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness</hi> of the least delaying of it. And if there should chance to be any here present, whose Wickedness and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity render this discourse as seasonable to them now, as St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s once was to <hi>Felix</hi>; I cannot but hope they may meet with somewhat in this <hi>reasoning</hi> that may have the same Effect upon them, but with a better Consequence than the <hi>Apostles</hi> had upon that wretched Man: may serve not only to awaken their fears of a <hi>judgment to come,</hi> but to stir them up to an immediate <hi>provision</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>But it is time now to remember, that I am speaking all this while to a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Assembly</hi>; and therefore to such, as will admit of yet more lively persuasives of a <hi>future Judgment</hi>; and of the <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Eternal Torments</hi> that await the Wicked after it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:59924:100"/>And I shall not need to say how much our <hi>Religion</hi> has discovered to us, to make the <hi>sinner tremble</hi> at the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of that <hi>dreadful Inquest,</hi> which the best <hi>Christian</hi> cannot think of without amazement.</p>
            <p>For indeed, where is the <hi>Soul</hi> so well established, so secure of its own sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to be able to endure the <hi>Horrors</hi> of that <hi>day,</hi> when the end of all things being come, the <hi>World</hi> its <hi>self</hi> shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to <hi>tremble</hi> and fall into its ancient <hi>Chaos. When the sun, and moon, and stars shall be darkened: the mountains shall quake, and the powers of Heaven be shaken. When the Earth shall be set on fire; the Heavens shall be shrivell'd up as a scroll, the Elements also shall melt with fervent heat.</hi> When the <hi>Trumpet shall sound,</hi> and <hi>the Graves be opened, and the Dead arise</hi>; and our <hi>Consciences</hi> begin to fly in our Faces, and represent to us the <hi>sins</hi> we have <hi>committed</hi>; the means and opportunities of <hi>repentance</hi> which we have <hi>neglected</hi>; and the Everlasting <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> to which we are now just ready to be <hi>condemn'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O! the <hi>terrors</hi> of that <hi>time,</hi> when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing distracted with all these amazements, we shall begin in vain to cry out to the

               <hi>Mountains to fall upon us, and to the Hills to cover us!</hi> When we shall be able no where to see any hope or comfort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to us. If we look up to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> that place which we shall now ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to approach; behold there our <hi>Judge</hi> with all his <hi>Holy Angels</hi> about him, <hi>pronouncing</hi> a bitter <hi>sentence</hi> of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and Wrath, and Eternal mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry against us.

            <p>How shall we then <hi>Curse</hi> our <hi>Sins,</hi> that have brought us into this desperate, lost estate? And too late begin to consider the wisdom of those happy men, who have been persuaded timely to think of, and to provide for <hi>Eternity.</hi>

            <p>IN which <hi>Words</hi> we have the result of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Discourse before <hi>Felix,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>future Judgment,</hi> and the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59924:103"/>
Punishments that should one day be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against sinners in it. He had sent for our <hi>Apostle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">—v.24.</note> who was then a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner at <hi>Caesarea,</hi> to hear what he had to say concerning the <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Gospel of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And as he reason'd of <hi>Righteousness, Temperance,</hi> and <hi>Judgment to come,</hi> Felix trembled, and answer'd, Go thy way for this time, when I have a convenient season I will call for thee.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It was the usual method of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in Preaching the Gospel of Christ, in the first place to awaken mens fears, by declaring to them the <hi>terrors</hi> of a <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture state,</hi> and the strict <hi>account</hi> that we must one day render to God of all our Actions; that so being full of Horror at the apprehension of their danger, they might become the better disposed to hearken to those means he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to propose to them, whereby to secure them against it. And in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> v<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. 11. he gives us an account how effectual a preparation it commonly made for him to prevail; <hi>Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord</hi>; i. e. as appears by the foregoing verse,<note place="margin">2 Cor. v.10.</note> this revelation of the <hi>future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we persuade men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:59924:103"/>He had here in this <hi>Felix,</hi> a most <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate sinner</hi> to deal with. A man in his <note n="‡" place="margin">Tacitus Hist. lib. v. c. 9. <hi>says of him, That</hi> per om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem saevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam ac li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidinem, jus regium servili ingenio exercuit. Et annal. l xii. c. 54. cuncta malefacta sibi impune ratus, tanta potentia subnixo.</note> 
               <hi>Government</hi> violent and unjust: In his <hi>own manners</hi> lewd and debauch'd: He had ravish'd another mans <note n="*" place="margin">Joseph. Antiq. Jud. l. 20. c. 5. pag. 616. Basil. 1544. <hi>The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of which see above,</hi> p. 159.</note> 
               <hi>Wife</hi> out of his bosom, and lived in an open state of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery</hi> with her.</p>
            <p>And now what so proper to awaken his <hi>Conscience,</hi> and make him indeed begin to repent him of his sins, as to <hi>reason</hi> before him of a <hi>Judgment to come?</hi> What <hi>Application</hi> so pertinent, as to show him the particular danger of <hi>unjust</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate</hi> men, that is, such as himself should be exposed to in it. This was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the most proper <hi>address</hi> to such a one; and such was this of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Felix: He reason'd</hi> before him <hi>of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, Temperance, and the</hi> Judgment <hi>to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And behold in my <hi>Text,</hi> the result of his Discourse, such as in all reason we might expect it should have been, <hi>Felix trembled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:59924:104"/>And now who would not hope for some good <hi>effect</hi> from so fair and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a <hi>beginning?</hi> And that the next thing we should have heard of, should have been some such <hi>question</hi> to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> once made on the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the other <hi>Apostles,</hi> Acts ii.37.<note place="margin">Act. ii.37.</note> 
               <hi>Men and Brethren, what shall we do?</hi> This one might reasonably have been expected should have been the result of his <hi>Terror.</hi> But alas! We find a much different effect of it. He was indeed amazed to hear of a <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come</hi>; but he could not for all that, resolve so soon to begin to provide for it. He <hi>trembled</hi> to think what his condition there should be, and very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably he might intend that he would sometime or other very seriously consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how he was prepared against it. But he could not presently determine to part with his sins; and therefore he defers the time; he puts off the <hi>Apostle</hi> to some more <hi>convenient sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>; but we never read that ever that season came, or that he had ever any Admonition given him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, to repent him of his evil doings.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:59924:104"/>
               <hi>Felix</hi> trembled, and answer'd, Go thy way for this time: when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</q>
            <p>Such was the effect of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning</hi> at this time before <hi>Felix</hi>; and I would to God we had no cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that such is too often the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of our <hi>Preaching</hi> to you. That the Knowledg which we have, and the belief which we profess of a <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come,</hi> were so efficacious to our amendment, that we none of us need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be called upon, no longer to defer it, but to begin in good earnest to consider how to make our Peace with God, and to provide for Eternity. But alas! I fear I have here pitch'd upon a subject never like to be out-dated. And tho it be certainly one of the greatest Contradictions in the world, not only to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> but to our own <hi>Interests</hi> too, and to which we are not apt to be so blind, to pretend to believe a <hi>judgment to come,</hi> and yet nevertheless to neglect to provide for it; yet I know not how, such is the power of our lusts, that they stop our ears against all Arguments, though
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59924:105"/>
never so clear and forcible, that would induce us to forsake them; we <hi>trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to think what shall be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of our <hi>sins,</hi> yet still we go on in the commission of them.</p>
            <p>And now what <hi>Argument</hi> can I take up more <hi>seasonable</hi> to the present time, or indeed more fit at all times for our Consideration, than to reason a while of this great and dangerous neglect? To enquire into the <hi>Causes</hi> which move so many thus to delay their <hi>Repentance,</hi> and to offer some effectual Arguments that may convince you of the unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableness of it. In a word, to stir up such an <hi>Auditory</hi> as this, both from the example of this wretched man in the <hi>Text,</hi> and from the just cause we may have to fear, lest if we continue with him to put off still the time of our <hi>Repentance,</hi> we finally perish with him in his <hi>Impenitence</hi>; to hasten with all the speed we can, to return to our duty, that our <hi>Iniquity may not</hi> be our ruin.</p>
            <p>And this is the design of my present Discourse, wherein I shall
<list>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:59924:105"/>
                  <item>First, Enquire into the <hi>Causes</hi> that move so many to <hi>delay</hi> their <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and be still putting off their provision for another World, to some more <hi>convenient season.</hi> And</item>
                  <item>Secondly, shall shew the <hi>Danger</hi> of so doing:</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And by both endeavour, what I can, to engage every one that now hears Me, to a <hi>timely,</hi> a <hi>speedy,</hi> or rather to speak more properly, to a <hi>present Repentance.</hi> And</p>
            <p>I<hi>st.</hi> Of the <hi>Causes</hi> that move so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to delay their <hi>Repentance</hi>; and be still putting off their provision for another World to some more <hi>Convenient Season.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now those, I presume, may well be reduced to these four General Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Either
<list>
                  <item>1<hi>st.</hi> They do not think at all, or not to any purpose, of their <hi>Future State,</hi> and therefore neglect to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for it. Or,</item>
                  <item>2<hi>dly,</hi> They do not believe there is so great a necessity of <hi>Repenting,</hi>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:59924:106"/>
in order thereunto, as we say there is. Or,</item>
                  <item>3<hi>dly,</hi> They suppose they may do this hereafter as well as now. Or,</item>
                  <item>4<hi>thly,</hi> Tho' they are convinced both of the necessity of their <hi>Repenting,</hi> and of the Reasonableness of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting presently about it, yet for all that, they cannot so soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to part with their Sins, and enter on a course of Piety and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>These are some of the Principal <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> that, I presume, may be likely to prompt Men to put off their Concern for another World; and I shall make it my Endeavour with all the plainness that I can, to shew the folly and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness of every one of them. And,</p>
            <p>1<hi>st.</hi> There are many in the World, who do not think at all, or not to any purpose, of their <hi>Future State,</hi> and therefore neglect to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for it.</p>
            <p>It is a matter of sad Consideration, to see how very Careless and Secure
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59924:106"/>
most men seem to be as to the Business of <hi>another World.</hi> They Live, if not as those who believe nothing at all of it, yet in such a manner as if they were not in the least danger of miscarrying in their way to it. They think and contrive how to manage their Affairs in this <hi>present Life</hi>: To <hi>Establish</hi> their <hi>Health,</hi> and to <hi>Improve</hi> their <hi>Fortunes,</hi> and add still new degrees to their <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> and <hi>Dignities.</hi> Only the <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the <hi>other World,</hi> that they seem to look upon as hardly worth their Care<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They leave it as a thing, that it will be time enough to provide for when they begin to come nearer to it; and 'tis no longer worth their while to trouble themselves about the good things of this.</p>
            <p>And now what can be more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable than such an <hi>Incogitancy?</hi> To spend all our thoughts and our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, upon a few Temporal pursuits, that have neither <hi>worth</hi> nor <hi>duration</hi> to recommend them to our desires; and in the mean time never to think at all, or at least not to any purpose, of those <hi>Joys</hi> and <hi>Glories</hi> that shall continue to all <hi>Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:59924:107"/>Indeed, had we either never heard of any such thing as a <hi>Judgment to Come</hi>; or did we not believe that there is such a <hi>State</hi> as our Religion has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us; A <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Everlasting Happiness</hi> if we do <hi>Well,</hi> but of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Punishment</hi> if we continue to do <hi>Ill,</hi> there might then be some Excuse for such a neglect. And yet, even in this Case too, we ought to be very sure there was no such thing as <hi>another World,</hi> before we could reasonably give over the thoughts of it.</p>
            <p>He that lives well, and denies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self some part of that Liberty, he would otherwise indulge himself <hi>now,</hi> out of the fear and apprehension of <hi>another Life that is to come,</hi> does at the most run but the little hazard of living a more Reserved and Innocent sort of Life than he needed to have done, if it shall hereafter appear that he was mistaken. Whereas he that confidently presumes there is no such thing as a <hi>Future State,</hi> and so neglects to provide for it, should it chance to be otherwise, must be for ever Miserable, without all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible means to reform his Error.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:59924:107"/>But for men to know and believe, that <hi>God will bring them to Judgment,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. xi.9.</note> and they cannot tell how soon he may do it: That if they chance to be caught away in the midst of their sins, as they see thousands are every day before their eyes, they shall then be doom'd to the wretched sentence of <hi>Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels</hi>;<note place="margin">Mat. xxv.41.</note> and yet still to continue careless and unconcern'd; and not so much as spend a thought how they are prepared to stand before the <hi>great Tribunal</hi>; This is, doubtless, such a piece of Indiscretion, as may well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve our pity and our wonder, but certainly will not need that I should say any thing to expose the desperate folly and unreasonableness of it.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> Another cause of mens <hi>delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> their <hi>Repentance,</hi> is, That they do not believe there is so great a <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>Repenting,</hi> as we say there is.</p>
            <p>This is a <hi>Cause</hi> which men do not indeed care so openly to profess; but yet such a one as their Actions often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do but too plainly point out
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59924:108"/>
to us. And I wish that even this were all; and that there were not some in the world, whose very <hi>Principles</hi> seem to lead them into such an opinion, so contrary to the very <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and so fatally ruinous to their own Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>For 1<hi>st.</hi> Not to say any thing now to those wise men of the world, who laugh at all our discourse of <hi>another life after this,</hi> and of an <hi>account to be given of all our Actions before a Divine Tribunal</hi>; but to leave them to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of their own <hi>Consciences,</hi> which speak loudly to them this great truth, and make them with <hi>Felix,</hi> still fear what they pretend not to believe: What shall we say to a more refined sort of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants; who acknowledging a <hi>future Judgment,</hi> and an <hi>Eternal Reward</hi> for those that do well, yet <hi>extinguish</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But yet still, methinks, since they confess that there is such a <hi>place</hi> as <hi>Heaven,</hi> and that there shall be an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> there to all <hi>Eternity,</hi> for those who <hi>at that day</hi> shall be found worthy of it; even this should be enough to make them think it worth their while to endeavour to procure themselves a share in so much happiness. And however they suppose that the <hi>Everlasting Punishment</hi> which the Holy Scriptures threaten sinners with, shall be only an <hi>Eternal Annihilation</hi>; yet since 'tis plain that the same Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures speak very dreadful things of it; and it cannot be denied,<note place="margin">

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59924:109"/>
a state of <hi>Misery,</hi> which neither any tongue can express, nor any thought conceive; and 'tis certain there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny passages in the Sacred Writ, that seem very much to favour this apprehension, indeed that cannot without violence be detorted to any other signification; It must certainly be the wisest course, not to be too secure in their own <hi>sense,</hi> but whether they believe the <hi>Torments</hi> of the <hi>Damn'd</hi> to be <hi>Eternal</hi> or no, yet certainly to live so as if they made not the least doubt of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>I need not say how many other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices these Men have found out, to free themselves from the trouble of a <hi>true Repentance.</hi> By <hi>Pardons</hi> and <hi>Indulgences</hi>; by <hi>Masses</hi> and <hi>Prayers for the dead</hi>; by <hi>Consecrated Garments,</hi> and <hi>Priviledg'd Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternities:</hi> and the End of all which, is
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59924:110"/>
what I am now complaing of, to make men careless and negligent in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of that Piety that God requires of them; and of that <hi>Repentance</hi> which alone can obtain an effectual forgiveness of their Sins.</p>
            <p>But these are not yet all, who by their mistaken <hi>Notions</hi> of some of the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> have been but too much encouraged to neglect the <hi>practise</hi> of a <hi>Christian life:</hi> Others there are,</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> And those of a more near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to us than either of the foregoing, whose <hi>Principles</hi> seem, without great care, but too naturally to tend to the same neglect. Such are, The Great As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertors of Salvation by <hi>Faith alone</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Works</hi>; of God's <hi>Eternal Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and in consequence thereof Mens <hi>Absolute Election or Reprobation</hi>; Of the <hi>slavery</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> and its incapacity to do any thing as to the business of our <hi>Future state</hi> without that <hi>special Grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which if men have, then they must needs do <hi>Well</hi>; and without it, cannot but do <hi>Ill</hi>; and which <hi>God</hi> does not afford <hi>indifferently</hi> to <hi>All</hi> those to whom the <hi>Gospel</hi> is <hi>preach'd,</hi> but to such only as he intends thereby to bring
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59924:111"/>
to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> first, and then to <hi>Salvation.</hi> Now not to dispute with any one the <hi>Truth</hi> of all these <hi>Points,</hi> when <hi>wisely</hi> and <hi>soberly</hi> stated according to the Authority of the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi>; that which I say, is this, That all these, and the like <hi>Principles,</hi> are apt to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Wicked Men,</hi> who are not very well instructed in the true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and understanding of them, to a <hi>neglect</hi> of their <hi>duty</hi>; as if the whole work of their <hi>Justification</hi> were either so secure and setled on the one hand, or else so desperate and impossible on the other, that there was no need of their own Care or Concern about it; nor any reason for them to trouble themselves about that, which if they shall ever attain, no negligence of their own can do them any hurt; if they must not, no care or endeavour can do them good.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I shall add but yet one thing more, which, I fear, has led many into a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi>; and that is, An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable presumption upon God's <hi>Mercy</hi>; either that he will afford them time to <hi>repent</hi> at the <hi>last,</hi> though they go on for the present in their <hi>Sins</hi>; or, if he does not, will at least make
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59924:111"/>
a very favourable allowance for their <hi>Impenitence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is an <hi>Opinion</hi> which Wicked Men do as greedily catch at, as their deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable State renders them greatly in need of it. And indeed far be it from me to lessen any reasonable Hopes of God's Favour to Sinners, who my self stand so much in need of it. No doubt, there <hi>is Mercy with God that he may be feared.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. cxxx.4.</note> Many are the ways, and Gracious and Excellent the Methods whereby He calls and invites us to <hi>Repentance.</hi> And if we accept the Invitation, we need not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion but that we shall most certainly receive the pardon of our Sins through the <hi>Blood of Christ.</hi> But then this is not the Question, Whether God will not make very great allowances for our <hi>Infirmities,</hi> and forgive us, though we have never so long and grievously sinn'd against Him, if we <hi>repent</hi> at the last. But whether, if we neglect the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities which he affords us of <hi>repenting</hi>; if with <hi>Felix</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> we still put off our <hi>Consciences</hi> to a <hi>more convenient season,</hi> and at last die in our sins with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever <hi>repenting</hi> of them, God will not then turn his Mercy into Judgment; and whether we ought not therefore to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59924:112"/>
make all the haste we can to <hi>repent,</hi> lest perhaps he should do so. But,</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> A third <hi>cause</hi> of mens <hi>delaying</hi> their <hi>Repentance</hi> is; That though they do believe it necessary for them to <hi>repent</hi> some time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet they think this may be done <hi>hereafter</hi> as well as <hi>now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is what most of us are but too apt to flatter our selves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. <hi>Repentance</hi> is, God knows, a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly <hi>duty:</hi> It calls us to another kind of life than that we have been used to, or indeed for the most part do at all desire to be acquainted with. He that will put it in practise, must expect to meet with no small difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the setting out; and few there are who have Constancy enough to go through them all; and therefore no wonder if we find the generality of Men so little care to set about a work that is so hard and discouraging to the most resolute Undertakers of it. Now 'tis this makes them willing to meet these troubles as late as ever they can: When their years run deep, and their Lusts fail them, and they can no longer pursue the Pleasures of this
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59924:112"/>
World, then they suppose it will be time enough to think of the other. And they see no reason, why they may not hope as well to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then, as others who in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner have come in at the <hi>Eleventh hour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. xx.6,</note> and yet received as great a reward, as those <hi>that had born the heat and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of the day.</hi>
               <note place="margin">— 12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But this is indeed as unreasonable a ground for any one to <hi>delay</hi> his <hi>Repentance,</hi> as either of the foregoing. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> They cannot endure to set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their <hi>duty</hi> immediately, because of the trouble and difficulty which they apprehend in it. I will not now enquire how they are sure it is so troublesome and difficult a thing to fulfil their duty, as they suppose it to be, seeing they have never yet tried it, to be convinced by their own Experience that it is so. This only I would know; Will it become ever the more easie for their deferring of it? Nay, but on the contrary, I shall hereafter shew, that the longer it is deferr'd, the harder it will prove to us. And were it not so, yet since 'tis <hi>necessary</hi> some time or other to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:59924:113"/>
and so <hi>Dangerous</hi> to die ere we have done it; Certainly the more <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult</hi> a thing it is, the sooner we ought to set about it, whilst we may have yet the time, by the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish it. And then,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> For that poor presumption, That others have done this, and yet were saved at the last, and why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may not we be so too? Though I will not say that none who have put off the business of their <hi>Repentance</hi> to the last, have ever gone to Heaven; yet I must needs say, I fear that but few have done so. I do not remember in all the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> more than <hi>One In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of the Salvation of a <hi>dying Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> and that so extraordinary in all its Circumstances, that it cannot with any reason be made a Precedent by us for the likes Hopes; I mean that of the <hi>Thief upon</hi> the <hi>Cross</hi>; And even of Him too it does not appear that ever he <hi>deferr'd</hi> his <hi>Repentance,</hi> or put it off purposely to that, as the most <hi>conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Season.</hi> And for those who came in at the <hi>Eleventh hour,</hi> and yet were received; I shall only say thus much, That they came in as soon as they were
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59924:113"/>
called, and did not refuse to go into the <hi>Vineyard</hi> at the <hi>Third hour,</hi> because they thought it was too soon, and their Laziness prompted them to decline their work, till <hi>the Heat and Burden of the day was past.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In short, He that <hi>delays</hi> his <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> upon this prospect, that he may do it hereafter as well as now, ought first to have very well consider'd these two things. 1<hi>st,</hi> Is he sure that he shall live to that time which he so warily allots to this great work? For if he be not, then I am sure he lives in danger of <hi>Eternal damnation</hi> all the while he neglects to enter on a state of Piety and Religion: and chuses rather to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his <hi>Everlasting Happiness,</hi> than to put himself upon a Work that yet must be done, or he shall remain for ever miserable. 2<hi>dly,</hi> Is he certain, that though he should live to that time, yet that then God will give him <hi>Grace</hi> to <hi>repent?</hi> That his Aversion to his duty shall not be greater then, than it is now; and his Unwillingness encrease the more, the older he grows in his Sins and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:59924:114"/>What the satisfaction of Mens Lusts may be, I cannot tell: but certainly, if they have any thoughts at all of their <hi>Future state,</hi> and do indeed believe a <hi>Judgment to come,</hi> such dangers as these cannot chuse but amaze them; and their disquiets at the Apprehension, that by thus deferring their <hi>Repentance</hi> they may possibly lose their Souls for ever, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely outweigh whatever <hi>Pleasures</hi> they can in the mean time propose to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by going on a little longer in their Wickedness.</p>
            <p>But I must not insist upon these things; and therefore</p>
            <p>4<hi>thly,</hi> And to conclude this Point: The last cause that moves many to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay</hi> their <hi>Repentance,</hi> is, that thô they are convinced both of the <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>repenting</hi> some time or other, and that it is highly reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable for them to set presently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, yet when all is done, their <hi>Lusts</hi> are too <hi>strong</hi> for them, and they cannot so soon resolve to part with their Sins, and enter on a Course of Piety and Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:59924:114"/>There is something in the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> so fatally bewitching to us, that if once we suffer our selves to be overcome with the <hi>Habit</hi> of it, 'tis after that, one of the hardest things in the World to recover our liberty, and prevent our selves from being altogether hardned <hi>by the deceitfulness of it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John viii<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 34.</note> 
               <hi>He that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth sin,</hi> says our Saviour Christ, <hi>is the servant of sin.</hi> Whether it be that the force and power of an Evil Course gains insensibly upon us, till at last we have no more strength remaining to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it; Or, Whether it be that the longer we continue in Sin, the more <hi>God's Grace</hi> is withdrawn, and the less assistance we have of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to extricate our selves out of it. But this is plain, that even the best Men find it a hard matter, with all their Industry, to keep themselves from its <hi>dominion</hi>; and to fulfil their Resolutions, though never so soon taken up, of discharging their duty, and living as becomes the Disciples of Christ.</p>
            <p>I do not in the least question, but that we are all of us sufficiently convinced of the reasonableness of what I have now been inforcing, of <hi>setting immediately about our duty:</hi> and, I believe, there are
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59924:115"/>
but few, if any among us, who, if they do not at this time, yet have at least some time or other resolved to do so. But I fear it would be a melancholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection to most of us, to think how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle we have fulfilled these <hi>Resolutions</hi> hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, and may give us some cause to fear whether we may not be but too likely still to continue in the same care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and impenitent state for the time to come.</p>
            <p>The truth is, in such a degenerate Age as this, wherein <hi>Vice</hi> is become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most reputable; and to be <hi>religious,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd pedantry and preciseness: When the Evil <hi>Customs</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> have prevailed so far above the <hi>Commandments</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that a Man must yield to be a little Wicked, unless he will run counter to the general practice of the World; and not a little negligent of his duty, to maintain the Company and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Times; 'tis not an easie thing for a Man to break through all these diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and resolve to <hi>save</hi> his <hi>Soul</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever censures or troubles he encounters for the so doing. And therefore, though we all of us know well enough what we ought to do, and cannot but be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times apprehensive of the dangers we
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59924:115"/>
run by our not doing of it, yet alas! we still go on in the neglect of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Ever thinking and resolving to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, but never able effectually to set about it.</p>
            <p>And thus have I given you such a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> prospect as the time would permit, of those <hi>Causes</hi> that so much indispose Men to a present <hi>Repentance</hi>: I go on to the other thing I proposed in order to the Cure of it.</p>
            <p>II<hi>dly,</hi> To shew the <hi>Danger</hi> of deferring the performance of it.</p>
            <p>For, if such a delay as this, be not only very <hi>unreasonable</hi> in it self, but shall be also very <hi>fatal</hi> in its Consequence; if there be really nothing in all those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences that usually keep men from a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent discharge of their duty, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Hazard to be run by it; Sure then we ought to begin immediately to do that which can neither be too soon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, nor at all delay'd without a very great danger: Which we must some time or other do, and which will still grow more difficult and uneasie to us, the longer it is that we put off the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:59924:116"/>And, 1<hi>st,</hi> Let me ask him that thus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects his <hi>Repentance,</hi> and thinks it will be time enough to set about it hereafter, when the heat of his Youth is past, and he begins to come to a greater strength of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Discretion,</hi> to govern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and to bring his Passions into sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; It may be gives it yet a longer <hi>delay,</hi> and reserves the business of <hi>Religion</hi> for the <hi>Close</hi> of his Life, and an immediate preparatory to the hour of his Death: Is he sure that he shall ever arrive to that time which he thus warily sets out for this great Work? I need not tell you how uncertain our lives are; What <hi>Diseases,</hi> what <hi>Accidents</hi> lay siege against us every Moment? And if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all this, some do live to a <hi>good Old Age</hi>; yet how many Thousands there are that fall in the strength and vigor of their years? And we cannot say but that this may be our Condition, as we are sure it has been the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many Others, who, it may be, as much flatter'd themselves with these Projects, as We do now, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in vain lamenting their mad Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Concern of their Salvation.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59924:116"/>
But this I must needs say, a greater provocation there cannot be given to <hi>God Almighty</hi> to <hi>cut us off in the midst of our years,</hi> and deprive us of that oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity we so presumptuously set out for to <hi>repent</hi> in, after a long life spent in Sin and Impenitence, than thus to go on in our wickedness, and designedly to live in a <hi>disobedience</hi> to his <hi>Commands,</hi> till we are no longer like to continue in this World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But however, 2<hi>dly,</hi> Let us allow of this, that we had by some means or other an Assurance of our lives, and could be certain we should arrive to that Time we thus lay out for the business of <hi>Religion.</hi> Yet how are we sure that we shall not then be altogether as unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and much more unable to <hi>repent,</hi> than we are now?</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> If we consider our selves only upon the Common <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> without reflecting upon the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> without which yet we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as to the Business of our <hi>Duty</hi>; Even these will tell us, That the more inveterate any <hi>Habit</hi> is, the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult it is to leave it, and the greater
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59924:117"/>
pains it will cost a Man to overcome it. And he who finds it so hard a Matter to conquer his <hi>Lusts</hi> now, what will he do hereafter, when the Indulgence of many years more shall have rooted them in his very Soul, and made his <hi>sins</hi> become even <hi>natural</hi> to him?</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> But then, <hi>secondly:</hi> If we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine this matter according to the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> these will shew a yet greater improbability of our <hi>repenting</hi> hereafter, than at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. It being not to be doubted, but that as upon the Use of <hi>God's Grace,</hi> He bestows a more liberal portion of it; so by <hi>refusing</hi> and <hi>resisting</hi> the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws his hand, and lessens his <hi>Grace,</hi> and it may be at last totally deprives Men of it.</p>
            <p>The truth is, I cannot but think that such Persons as these, who not only <hi>continue</hi> in the Commissions of <hi>sin,</hi> but project and contrive for the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing</hi> in it; and therefore put off the Time of their <hi>Repentance</hi> as a work that may be well enough done hereafter, do in effect <hi>despise the Holy
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59924:117"/>
Spirit of God,</hi> and <hi>trample under foot that Grace</hi> which should have led them to <hi>Repentance.</hi> And it must certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be a most daring Presumption in any Sinner, to think, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing such a provocation, God will yet attend his leisure, and continue to afford him the Assistance of his <hi>Grace</hi> for his Salvation at the last, though he has so often, wilfully, and designedly rejected all the Offers of it.</p>
            <p>I am sufficiently persuaded, that there is none of us, whom <hi>God</hi> does not call most truly and sincerely to <hi>Salvation</hi>; and by consequence, that there is none of us, to whom he has not offer'd such a measure of his <hi>Grace,</hi> as might enable him to fulfil his <hi>Duty,</hi> in order thereunto, and perfect his <hi>Repentance.</hi> But I must confess, I cannot without some concern think, what an unworthy use we have the most of us made of it, and how justly we have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that God should at last leave us to our selves, and no longer in vain attend our Amendment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:59924:118"/>And O! that we would therefore be persuaded seriously to reflect upon all these things, and no longer go on to expose our <hi>immortal souls</hi> to such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate hazards, as 'tis plain from all these Considerations we do, every day that we neglect to provide for <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>! Be it enough that we are not alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made the fatal Monuments of Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Mercy: That we are yet on this side <hi>Hell,</hi> and may if we please, by our <hi>speedy Repentance,</hi> still prevent those <hi>Judgments</hi> which our former <hi>Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> has but too justly deserved.</p>

of <hi>Conscience,</hi> and the motions of God's <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to the contrary, but after many admonitions in vain sent us by his merciful <hi>Providence</hi> to bring us to <hi>Repentance.</hi> There are, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but few, if any, in the World, so lost to all the Hopes of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Eternity,</hi> who have not some time or other, been put in mind of their <hi>Duty,</hi> and invited by God's <hi>Grace,</hi> to <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi> And if notwithstanding all this, men will nevertheless continue still incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and harden themselves against all the means that can be made use of to reclaim them, we ought not to wonder, if they are at last given up to the <hi>Dominion</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> and reserved as monuments of the <hi>just Judgment of God,</hi> at the <hi>day of his glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not now enter on any Enquiry what the cause should be, why we who are all of us sufficiently convinced of the <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>Repenting,</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable State in which we must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be, if we do not some time or other effectually set about it; should yet still for the most part be so very unwilling to <hi>Repent.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:59924:120"/>But because, this is one of the most fatal delusions men are apt to cheat themselves withall, that with <hi>Felix</hi> here in my <hi>Text,</hi> they put off this business to a <hi>more convenient Season,</hi> and by their unseasonable <hi>Procrastina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in an Affair that of all others ought the least to be defer'd, too often die without ever performing it at all; I will make it my endeavour so to lay before you the <hi>Danger</hi> of such a <hi>Delay,</hi> as if it shall please God to convince you not so much of the <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>Repenting</hi> some time or other, which I take it for granted without my speaking you are all of you already resolved to do, as of the great concern we have immediately to set about it; and do that <hi>presently</hi> which we must some time or other do, and can never do so Well as now.</p>

            <p>That the <hi>Shortness</hi> and <hi>Vncertainty</hi> of our <hi>Present State,</hi> ought to convince us how great a <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> we run by <hi>Delaying</hi> our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Proof whereof I shall not think it necessary to entertain you with any <hi>Common-place-Argument</hi> of the <hi>Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of our <hi>Nature,</hi> and the many <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualties</hi> to which our <hi>Lives</hi> here are perpetually exposed, and against which we can never say we are secure for the next moment. How many <hi>Persons</hi> have been struck with <hi>Sudden Death</hi>? What accidents have befallen others to render them wholly unfit for their <hi>Duty</hi>; so that though they have had a longer warning of their Approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing End, yet either by the Intollerable Sharpness of their Pain, or its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon their understanding Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, so as many times to deprive them
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59924:122"/>
of all the use of their <hi>Reason,</hi> and render them utterly uncapable, either to <hi>reflect</hi> upon their <hi>lives,</hi> or to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> them of their <hi>Sins,</hi> have been so far indisposed to all the Offices of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> that their longer respite has proved of no more advantage to them, than if they had not had the least notice of their approaching End. These are things which every Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of <hi>Mortality</hi> for the most part abounds with; and a daily <hi>Experience</hi> renders any long insisting upon them, needless to us.</p>
            <p>We live in the midst of the <hi>Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of <hi>Death.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. cxi.7.</note> 
               <hi>Thousands fall</hi> every day <hi>besides us, and ten thousands at our right hand:</hi> And it is only of the Mercy of God that we are yet <hi>alive,</hi> to consider these things, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to <hi>die.</hi> And sure then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be a very great <hi>danger,</hi> as it is certainly a very great <hi>presumption</hi> in any Man to neglect this, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his <hi>Repentance</hi> to such a Time as he can never be sure he shall live to see.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:59924:122"/>And this is an <hi>Argument</hi> which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man's own reason will at the first view offer to him to convince him of the <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>procrastinating</hi> his <hi>Repentance:</hi> And such as ought never the less to be consider'd, because it lies so obvious to our understandings, as to be the common <hi>Topick</hi> of every one in the managing of this <hi>Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But yet, since such is the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of our Nature, that we are apt to overlook many times what is the nearest to us; and common <hi>Arguments,</hi> like other <hi>ordinary things,</hi> are not usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally so much regarded, as otherwise the true weight and value of them would deserve they should be: I will endeavour to improve this useful <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,</hi> by desiring these two things may be farther considered in it, and which perhaps are not so commonly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> Whether he who <hi>delays</hi> his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> now, out of a prospect that he shall hereafter have time enough to enter upon the practise of it; does not, besides the <hi>danger</hi> which arises from the <hi>common uncertainty</hi> of <hi>life,</hi>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:59924:123"/>
and the <hi>miseries</hi> and <hi>casualties</hi> that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily accompany it, to prevent his <hi>Repenting</hi> at all, expose himself more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over by this very thing to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular hazard of the <hi>Judgment</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to cut him off in the midst of his Sins. What such Persons as these may think of their putting off their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> to some future season, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell; But I must confess, when I consider the full import of it, I cannot but look upon this as one of the most provoking Crimes in the World; Nor do I think it possible for any man to add a higher Aggravation to his Sins, than being <hi>admonish'd</hi> of his <hi>danger,</hi> and so far convinced of the <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>Repenting,</hi> as to resolve some time or other to enter upon it; nevertheless still to go on in his Evil way, and desperately resolve not to begin to be religious, till things are come to the very last Extremity, and it is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary for the <hi>saving</hi> of his <hi>Soul.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> He who neglects to <hi>repent</hi> at the <hi>present,</hi> out of a presumption that he shall <hi>hereafter</hi> have Time enough to do
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59924:123"/>
it, when <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Infirmities</hi> are crept upon him, and he is no longer in a Condition to pursue the pleasures of his Sins; What does he but in effect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that the best of his Time is fit to be consecrated to the service of his <hi>Sins,</hi> and the refuse only to be reserved for <hi>God,</hi> which he knows not well o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise how to dispose of?</p>
            <p>I need not say how reproachful a thing this must be to <hi>Religion,</hi> to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem it a Work fit only for that part of our lives in which we are not good for any thing besides. But sure I am, that Man must have a very mean No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>God Almighty,</hi> who can think him of so <hi>Easie</hi> a Temper, and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent to <hi>Sinners,</hi> as to be willing to receive them at any rate; and after all the <hi>Indignity</hi> and <hi>Scorn</hi> with which they have treated Him all their life-long, to be glad to take them upon their own Terms, and rather than go without them, to accept even of this <hi>slight</hi> and <hi>seeming submission</hi> from them.</p>
            <p>It must be confess'd indeed, that great is the <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>long-suffering</hi> of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59924:124"/>
               <hi>God,</hi> beyond any thing we are able to express or to conceive.<note place="margin">Psal. cxxx.4.</note> But then <hi>there is mercy with him,</hi> that he may be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and <hi>feared,</hi> not <hi>affronted</hi> and <hi>abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> by us. <hi>His Goodness leads to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> but gives no encouragement to our <hi>Impenitence.</hi> And he who thinks that <hi>God</hi> will accept the <hi>Refuse</hi> of his <hi>Time,</hi> after a long life spent in the <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> of <hi>sin</hi>; and the business of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> put off on purpose to this <hi>last pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,</hi> as supposing it would then be soon enough to provide for <hi>Eternity</hi>; will, I fear, instead of an Acceptance, meet with the same reproof those of old in the like case did, who kept the best of their Flocks, and of their Herds for themselves, and offered to him the <hi>Blind,</hi> and the <hi>Lame,</hi> and the <hi>Sick for sacrifice</hi>;<note place="margin">Mal i.8, 10</note> Mal. i.10.14. <hi>I have no pleasure in you, saith the</hi> Lord <hi>of</hi> Hosts, <hi>neither will I accept an</hi> Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>at your hands.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:59924:124"/>But 2dly. He who thus <hi>delays</hi> his <hi>Repentance,</hi> does not only provoke <hi>God</hi> by <hi>continuing</hi> at the <hi>present</hi> in <hi>sin,</hi> and that too out of an unwarrantable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption that he shall be accepted at the last, though in the mean time he continues <hi>Impenitent</hi>; but 'tis plain, has no true <hi>Honour</hi> for <hi>God</hi> at all; nor thinks of <hi>Repenting</hi> even then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he <hi>loves God,</hi> and desires to please him, but merely because he is afraid he shall otherwise be damn'd, and <hi>lose his Soul</hi> to all <hi>Eternity.</hi> For else, had such a one any <hi>real sense</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> or did he even then intend in good earnest to set about the <hi>practice</hi> of it, it is not to be imagined where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that he at present neglects the performance of it. Nor can any other account be given why he does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the next moment to be <hi>religious,</hi> but only this, that he does not truly <hi>love God,</hi> nor <hi>desire</hi> to serve <hi>him,</hi> nor by his good will would ever think of doing of it.</p>
            <p>Now this will yet more aggravate the heinousness of such a <hi>delay,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray a desperate contempt of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59924:125"/>
Goodness</hi> and <hi>Wisdom:</hi> As if <hi>God</hi> either were not able to discover our <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> and distinguish between a real <hi>Penitent,</hi> and a <hi>pretending</hi> Votary; or would otherwise so far connive at it, as to accept of a shadow of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, a form of Godliness</hi> reserved on purpose for the last business of our lives, and then too put on only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it could no longer be deferr'd, not out of any <hi>love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> but merely for fear of his <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Vengeance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when such is the desperate <hi>Provocation</hi> which every <hi>Sinner</hi> by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying</hi> his <hi>Repentance,</hi> adds to all the rest of his Impieties; I cannot but think, we ought seriously to consider, before we venture upon such a <hi>Procrastinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> or rather, to speak more properly, to keep our selves from <hi>deferring</hi> our <hi>Repentance</hi> at all; not only how very little security we have of our lives, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of the general uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of our condition in this world; But whether this very thing of <hi>putting off the business of Religion to such a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> may not be a particular means to call down some <hi>speedy Judgment</hi> upon
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59924:125"/>
us, so that we shall never come to that <hi>time</hi> we designed for this work. But.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Should nothing of this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unto us, yet still it cannot but be very <hi>dangerous</hi> to <hi>defer</hi> our <hi>Repenting,</hi> though never so little, seeing such is the difficulty of performing it, that he who has the longest life, will find it scarce enough to discharge it as he ought to do. And he that puts it off as a work that may be done well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough hereafter, in his declining years, perhaps in his last sickness; may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly do somewhat which he may call <hi>Repenting,</hi> but which 'tis very great odds shall have little in it, more than the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Appearance</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>And this brings me to the <hi>Second General Argument</hi> I proposed, to shew the danger of <hi>Deferring</hi> our <hi>Duty. viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II<hi>dly,</hi> From the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Difficulty</hi> of <hi>Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is an Argument which I the rather chuse to insist upon on this
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59924:126"/>
occasion, because I am apt to believe 'tis the mistake of the true <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi> that chiefly encourages so many to a delay of it. For sure were men heartily persuaded, that 'tis so great a thing to <hi>Repent</hi> as indeed it is; that it requires so much Labour and Pains to accomplish it, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not presently be known even by our own selves whether it be perform'd as it ought or no; insomuch that should we allow him who has put off his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the present, to discharge it tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the last, yet 'twill be impossible for him till he comes to the <hi>Judgment-Seat of Christ,</hi> to be sure that he has done so; they would never venture to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to such a time, in which 'tis next to a Miracle for a man not to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry in it.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Repentance,</hi> if taken in that proper Notion which the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> give us of it, is a <hi>change of Mind,</hi> in the words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. iii.11.</note> 
               <hi>an eschew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Evil, and a doing Good.</hi> It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists not in a bare <hi>sorrow for Sin,</hi> or a <hi>Desire</hi> and <hi>Resolution</hi> to live better for the time to come, but in a <hi>real Conversion.</hi> By consequence, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59924:126"/>
it as we ought to do, we must not only be <hi>sorry</hi> for our <hi>sins,</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> and <hi>resolve</hi> to amend, but we must truly and heartily endeavour so to do. 'Tis a <hi>change</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> in which the true per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this <hi>Duty consists</hi>; and whatsoever comes short of this, when we have opportunity so to do, is not a sincere <hi>Repentance,</hi> nor will ever be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of by God as such.</p>
            <p>And when such is the nature of this <hi>Duty,</hi> I shall not need to say, either how difficult it is to discharge it, or how much <hi>Time</hi> as well as <hi>Labour</hi> it will cost us to accomplish it. It is not a little while that will suffice to overcome those vicious habits, which a long practice has rendred almost na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to us; to conquer our passions, and bring our most extravagant lusts into subjection to the rules of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And we may have just reason to fear by the difficulty we find but of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning this work, how much more pains and trouble it will cost us to bring it to perfection.</p>
            <p>Let us add to this, That every <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi> and that of Sin above all others, the longer it is continued in, the more
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59924:127"/>
it roots it self in our very Natures, and the greater <hi>time</hi> and <hi>pains</hi> it will require to remove it. So that then our Task will increase every day upon our hands; and the longer we <hi>neglect</hi> our <hi>duty,</hi> we shall not only have the less <hi>time</hi> remaining to fulfil it in, but we shall still have the more to do to discharge it as we ought to do.</p>
            <p>If therefore we can with any reason suppose, that we shall be able to do all this at the last: If we can indeed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely presume that such a <hi>change</hi> as this is a work fit for our <hi>declining years:</hi> That when our Memory is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd, and our Thoughts move slow; When our Reason begins to fail us, and the Infirmities of our Age, and our Sins to surround us; We shall then be in a Condition to look back into all the remote Passages of our Lives pass'd, and to call our selves to an account for all our sins, and raise up our resentments to a true and real Contrition for them; and so to change our very Natures, as from old, Habitual Sinners, to become upon the sudden, <hi>New Creatures</hi>; from the Servants of Sin, the Children of God; let us then, if we please, put
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59924:127"/>
off our <hi>Repentance</hi> to the <hi>last Act;</hi> and resolve that it will be time enough for us then to begin to <hi>live,</hi> when we are just now about to <hi>die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we cannot, without the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most unreasonableness, imagine that we shall then be able to do all this: If such a <hi>change</hi> as I have now mention'd, and as the true <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi> does imply, be a work that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire our best strength and labour to accomplish it, and without some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary measure of the <hi>Divine Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> be too much even for that: It must then remain, that tho' we were the Masters of our own time, yet we could not, without a very great danger, put our <hi>Salvation</hi> upon such a Hazard as this, in which if we should allow it possible for a man to attain unto it, yet to be sure that is all, and 'tis a thousand to one but he comes short of it.</p>
            <p>There is yet a <hi>third</hi> Consideration which I proposed, and which will still more shew the <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>delaying</hi> our <hi>Repentance,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:59924:128"/>III<hi>dly,</hi> From the <hi>Method</hi> by which God usually proceeds in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation of his <hi>Grace,</hi> as it is set out to us in the <hi>Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have already observed, from the very nature of all <hi>Habits</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> that the longer any one goes on in an Evil Course, the more unwilling he will be, and the greater difficulty he will find it to get out of it. But in the <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> especially every little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, adds a new strength to our Passions; and those Lusts which at first might more easily have been overcome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing suffer'd by a longer continuance to insinuate themselves into our very <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> get the mastery of us, so that we have neither <hi>desire</hi> nor <hi>ability</hi> to rid our selves of them.</p>
            <p>No one becomes extremely wicked upon a sudden. When first Men begin to enter upon an Evil Course, they find many difficulties arise on every side to reclaim them from it. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> is vigilant, and for the most part very troublesome too. It remonstrates

to them the baseness and unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a Vicious course of life, and it is not without some violence that they break through the restraints of Shame and Modesty to pursue it.

            <p>Now all these, and many other hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances of the like kind, which the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner meets with in the first beginnings of his Evil Course, are not only so many <hi>Barriers</hi> which it has pleased God to set in our way to keep us from ruine, but so many helps too to assist us, if we should at any time be enticed to do
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59924:129"/>
wickedly, to recover our selves again out of it. But by a longer <hi>Continuance</hi> in <hi>Sin,</hi> all these are overcome; and we are not only thereby more deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the ways of wickedness; but having lost all these Assistances, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat is also rendred infinitely more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, than whilst we lay under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints of <hi>Shame,</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> to reclaim us.</p>
            <p>But this is not yet all: for by <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing</hi> in <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>putting off</hi> the time of our <hi>Repentance,</hi> we do not only diminish our own <hi>Natural strength,</hi> and thereby render our selves still less able to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with it; but what is yet more to be consider'd, we deprive our selves of the Assistance of God's <hi>Grace</hi> too, without which it will be impossible for us ever to overcome it.</p>
            <p>It is laid down by <hi>Isaiah</hi> as the reason why God forsook his ancient People the <hi>Jews,</hi> Chap. lxiii. vers. 10. That <hi>they rebelled, and vexed his Holy Spirit, therefore was he turn'd to be their Enemy, and He fought against them.</hi> And our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> in his <hi>Gospel</hi> every-where proceeds upon this measure in the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensations</hi> of his <hi>Grace</hi>; that <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. xiii.12.

who has,</hi> i. e. who makes use of, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves what God has already bestow'd upon him, <hi>shall be given,</hi> and he shall have more abundantly: But <hi>from him that has not,</hi> i. e. that does not make use of, and improve what he has, even <hi>that which he</hi> once <hi>had, shall be taken away.</hi> And however it may sometimes please God in an extraordinary manner to raise up Sinners at the last, and though they continue long in their Wickedness, yet nevertheless still continue his <hi>Divine As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance</hi> to them, to bring them to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:</hi> yet cannot this be any Ground for any one to rely upon in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, seeing it is plain both from the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Common Experience</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> that in the ordinary Methods of <hi>God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> his <hi>Grace</hi> is withdrawn in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Men's neglect of it, till at last they are utterly deprived of it,<note place="margin">2 Tim. ii.26.</note> and <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to be led Captive by the Devil at his Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is that we sometimes read in <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> of Persons deliver'd up to a <hi>Hardness and Impenitence of heart.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. xiii.14. Mark vi.52. John xii.40. Hebr. iii.13. Rom. ii.5.</note> Not that I think God ordains any man to destruction, or denies him such a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59924:130"/>
of his <hi>Grace</hi> as may be sufficient to preserve him from it; But when Men neglect his Offer, and <hi>despise</hi> and <hi>grieve</hi> his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>; and go on in their <hi>Sins,</hi> notwithstanding all the <hi>methods</hi> of his <hi>Providence</hi> to bring them to <hi>repentance</hi>; When the <hi>measure of their Iniquities is now fill'd</hi> up, and they are become ripe for Vengeance; then God is pleased sometimes to <hi>withdraw his Grace from them,</hi> and <hi>seal them up unto destruction</hi>: And tho he may sometimes permit them, for other <hi>ends</hi> of his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> to continue still in this World, yet he no longer continues the Power and Assistance of his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to them, to bring them to <hi>repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I take to have been the Case of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> after the <hi>Sixth Judgment.</hi> Till then,<note place="margin">Exod. vii.14.viii.19, 32.</note> the Scripture tells us, that <hi>He hardned his Heard,</hi> or that <hi>His Heart was hardned:</hi> But when his own <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> confess'd that the <hi>finger of God</hi> plainly shew'd it self in the <hi>Miracles of Moses,</hi> and yet he still continued obstinate; then <hi>God</hi> declares that <hi>He hardned him:</hi> Exod. ix.12. and <hi>caused him to stand,</hi> i. e. kept him alive when he had deserved to be punish'd with a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59924:130"/>
quick destruction; <hi>for this very end, that he might shew in him his power</hi>; Exod. ix.16.</p>
            <p>Many are the Declarations of the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> that confirm this to us. If we look into the state of the <hi>Old World</hi> before the <hi>Flood; God</hi> himself declares, <hi>Gen.</hi> vi.3. <hi>That his</hi> Spirit <hi>should not always strive with Man:</hi> Yet a <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty years,</hi> and if they <hi>repented not</hi> in that time, then He would bring an utter Destruction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
            <p>And in the same manner we find Holy <hi>David</hi> speaking in the person of <hi>God</hi> concerning the Rebellious <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites:</hi> and which I the rather remark, because Saint <hi>Paul</hi> applies it, <hi>Hebr.</hi> iii.12. to the very purpose of what I am now speaking: That because they <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their hearts, and tempted and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God forty years,</hi> therefore he at last <hi>sware to them in his wrath, that they should not enter into his rest.</hi> And the application which the <hi>Apostle</hi> makes, is this plain Conclusion; <hi>Take heed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. iii<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11.</note> Brethren, <hi>lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">—12.</note> 
               <hi>But exhort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:59924:131"/>
daily, <hi>while it is called to</hi> day, <hi>lest any of you be</hi> hardned <hi>through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lastly, to mention no more, The same is the Declaration which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> makes in the Name of <hi>God,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Destruction of hardned and impenitent <hi>Sinners, Prov.</hi> i. where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving first set forth the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> ready to assist them, if they would repent: verses 22, 23. <hi>How long, ye sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ones, will ye love simplicity? And ye scorners delight in their scorning,</hi> and <hi>fools hate knowledge? Turn you at my reproof: Behold, I will pour out my</hi> Spirit <hi>upon you, I will make known my words unto you:</hi> He afterwards declares the just indignation of God against them, if they should still continue obstinate and impenitent; verses 24, 25, 26. <hi>Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded; But ye have set at nought all my Counsel, and would have none of my Reproof: I also will laugh at your Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and mock when your fear cometh.</hi> And again, Verses 28, 29, 30. <hi>Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59924:131"/>
shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: For they hated knowledge, and did not chuse the fear of the</hi> Lord: <hi>They would none of my Counsel; they despised all my Reproof: Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were an easie matter to multiply Passages to the same purpose out of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of the <hi>Holy Scripture.</hi> But I have said enough already to shew the <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>delaying</hi> our <hi>Repentance,</hi> from the apprehension of over-passing the time of it; and to warrant that great Conclusion, which I think is generally received by <hi>most Christians</hi>; viz. That there is to every <hi>wicked man,</hi> a certain <hi>Time,</hi> when the <hi>measure</hi> of his <hi>Iniquities</hi> being accomplish'd, there shall be no more any <hi>space</hi> for <hi>repentance,</hi> nor any farther assistance given them by <hi>God,</hi> to bring them to it.</p>
            <p>Now if this be so, then would I only desire, that these three things might se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously be consider'd by every one of us.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> Whether he, who being invited by the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Motions</hi> of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59924:132"/>
his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>; by the cheeks of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> within, and the importunate calls of the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> without, to <hi>Repentance,</hi> nevertheless neglects all these Admonitions, and with <hi>Felix</hi> still puts off the practice of this duty to some more convenient season; does not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>grieve the Holy Spirit of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. iv.30.</note> and <hi>despise</hi> his <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>affront</hi> his <hi>Goodness,</hi> who thus graciously offers and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to him the <hi>means</hi> and <hi>opportunities</hi> of <hi>Salvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Whether by so doing, he does not provoke <hi>God</hi> in as high a manner as can well be imagined, no longer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his <hi>Grace</hi> to him, nor to expose his <hi>Mercy</hi> to contempt, by suffering his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit</hi> still to <hi>strive</hi> with such obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Offenders? And then by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> and <hi>lastly</hi>; Whether every such Person may not have just cause to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that by <hi>delaying</hi> his <hi>Repentance,</hi> and putting off the business of Religion to a still future opportunity, he shall at last provoke God to withdraw his <hi>Grace</hi> from him? And seeing when he had the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59924:132"/>
opportunity given him, and was invited to <hi>repent,</hi> he despised the offer, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected so to do, <hi>God</hi> may not hereafter deliver him up to a <hi>hardned</hi> and <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent heart</hi>;<note place="margin">Rom. ii.5.</note> and take away that <hi>Grace</hi> from him, which he has so unworthily abused, and thereby deserved to have no longer continu'd to him.</p>
            <p>To conclude:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Matt. xxv.14.28, 30.</note> If in that famous <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of the <hi>Talents,</hi> there be any <hi>application</hi> yet remaining to be made of that part of it, in which we find the <hi>Talent</hi> taken from the <hi>unprofitable Servant,</hi> and a terrible Sentence of Everlasting Misery pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against him for his neglect: Or, in that other of the <hi>Fig-tree,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. xiii.6.</note> which was to be <hi>pruned</hi> and <hi>digg'd,</hi> and then try'd another year; and if still it continued to bring forth no Fruit, then to be <hi>cut down,</hi> and <hi>cast out</hi> of the <hi>Vineyard:</hi> The meaning of both can be no other than this; That he who despising the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the opportunity of Salvation, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues</hi> still in his <hi>Sins,</hi> and improves not those Abilities God has given him to the great ends for which they were bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him, shall at last by a severe, but most just <hi>judgment</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59924:133"/>
of them; and have his neglect punish'd with the loss of God's <hi>Grace</hi> here, and in the consequence of it, with an <hi>Eternal Damnation</hi> hereafter.</p>
            <p>And this then may suffice to shew, how dangerous it is for a man to put off the business of <hi>Repentance</hi> at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, out of an unwarrantable presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that it will be time enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it hereafter. But now if the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> be, What a man who has unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily done this, should do? I reply,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> Let him by all means hasten his <hi>Repentance</hi> all he can; and the longer he has deferr'd it already, the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and resolute let him be not to put it off one moment longer.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Let him be so much the more zealous and diligent in his Religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances; let his <hi>sorrow</hi> be the more pungent, his <hi>Confessions</hi> the more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, his <hi>Prayers</hi> the more fervent; but especially his <hi>Resolutions</hi> and his <hi>Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi> the more hearty and sincere to break off the course of his <hi>Sins,</hi> the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he has continued in them: that so by the extraordinary vigor of his present Endeavours, he may make some kind of <hi>reparation</hi> for the slowness he has been
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59924:133"/>
hitherto guilty of in setting about his duty.</p>
            <p>But this is not all: It will, perhaps, be farther enquired; Whether upon the <hi>Principle</hi> I have now laid down, of the withdrawing <hi>God's Grace</hi> from such as refuse and reject the offers of it, it will not follow, that such persons as these are to be look'd upon as in a <hi>desperate Estate</hi>; and therefore that it is in vain for them now to think of <hi>repenting</hi> at all?</p>
            <p>But this is a <hi>Question</hi> which every man will best be able to satisfy himself about. That he who puts off his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> now, upon a presumption that it will be time enough to fulfil it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, may justly fear the <hi>withdrawing</hi> of <hi>God's Grace</hi> from him, I have fully shewn: But that God does absolutely withdraw his <hi>Grace</hi> from every such Person, I do not say; and whether or no he has <hi>withdrawn</hi> it from any particular Person, he will presently be able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern by the <hi>state</hi> in which he finds his Soul as to the business of <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If his Lusts and his Passions lead him captive at their pleasure; If he has no Affections or Desires remaining after
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59924:134"/>
Piety in his soul; if he cares not for God nor his duty, nor can yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade himself either to think of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, or to provide for it; These indeed are, though I will not say <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain signs</hi> of a <hi>desperate condition,</hi> yet such as may give us just cause to fear whether he be not come into that <hi>state,</hi> from which there is no <hi>Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and in which God will no longer give him any Assistance, to return into the way of Righteousness.</p>
            <p>But if, on the contrary, he even now begins to come again to himself, and wishes and desires, if it be possible, to be reconciled unto God: If being touch'd with a lively sence of his <hi>sins</hi> and his <hi>obstinacy,</hi> he is at last willing to amend, and <hi>return unto God with all his heart</hi>: Then 'tis plain, that though his Condition may be bad, yet it is not desperate. <hi>God</hi> has not yet given him up a <hi>Slave</hi> to the <hi>Devil,</hi> but still continues to him the benefit of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>; so that if he be not again want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to himself, he may yet hope for a sufficient <hi>measure</hi> of <hi>Divine Grace</hi> to bring him by <hi>Repentance</hi> to Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:59924:134"/>But here still there will one difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty more arise, and it is this. How such a Person shall satisfie himself that he is <hi>truly penitent</hi>; and by consequence that he may depend upon the mercy of God for Pardon, notwithstanding his former <hi>Impenitence?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answer, 1<hi>st.</hi> If the person who thus <hi>repents</hi> at the last, be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of continuing yet longer in this world, he may then be sure of the <hi>since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of his <hi>Repentance,</hi> and of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent security of his Condition, by the same experience that all others are, <hi>viz.</hi> by the <hi>fruits</hi> of it in a constant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Piety and Good-Works. But now</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. If the Question be of a <hi>dying Penitent,</hi> then indeed it will be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of more difficulty to answer it. For if on the one hand I may not be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable as to conclude <hi>at all adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> the utter invalidity of such a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> because for ought I know, 'tis possible for a man in the very last <hi>act</hi> of his <hi>life,</hi> to be struck with such a <hi>true contrition</hi> for his <hi>sins,</hi> as might,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59924:135"/>
if he had lived, have produced a <hi>real Amendment,</hi> and then <hi>God</hi> who is able to discern this, will consider him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: Yet neither on the other, can we ever be sure that such a <hi>Repentance</hi> is sincere, nor by consequence may we <hi>at all Adventures</hi> supppose in favour of it.</p>
            <p>The truth is, a <hi>Death-bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> is, in the best prospect we can take of it, <hi>exceeding dangerous,</hi> and in the case before us, I am afraid <hi>despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</hi> Nor have we in all the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> so much as one <hi>Example</hi> of any one that purposely put off his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> to this time, and yet was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon it; and the <hi>Instance</hi> of <hi>Felix</hi> in my <hi>Text,</hi> is a terrible one to the contrary. He was touch'd with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preaching, and feared the <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of which he spake. But he put off the <hi>Apostle</hi> to a more <hi>convenient sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>; and we do not find that ever that more <hi>convenient season</hi> came, or that he had ever any future call to <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not to be question'd, but that if a man be come to this sad pass, he ought by all means to be exhorted to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59924:135"/>
               <hi>repent,</hi> because otherwise to be sure, he must perish, and 'tis possible this may save him. But what that <hi>Repentance</hi> is, which a wicked man then exercises, we cannot tell, and the effect of it must be left to <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Judgment</hi> to declare; and it will be our parts instead of being over-inquisitive into these secrets, to be careful not to expose our selves to a condition so full of <hi>danger</hi>; in which there is much to be <hi>feared,</hi> but little <hi>Hope,</hi> and no Security.</p>
            <p>And now, what more remains to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to a <hi>speedy,</hi> or rather to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Repentance,</hi> but that having thus largely shewn the danger of deferring our duty, I very briefly close all with a more excellent Prospect,</p>
            <p>II<hi>dly,</hi> Of the <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> that will arrive to us from the <hi>Consideration</hi> of having <hi>perfected</hi> this great and necessary Work.</p>
            <p>This is a Point on which it were as easie to speak great things, as I think 'tis needless so to do. If to Live in a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Friendship</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> and to be able to look forward into Eternity
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59924:136"/>
with Comfort; If to be freed from the <hi>stings</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi> and the <hi>Terrors</hi> of <hi>Everlasting Punishment,</hi> and instead thereof to be full of a well-grounded Confidence that <hi>Heaven</hi> and all its <hi>Glories</hi> shall be one day Ours; in short, If there be any such thing as a <hi>Felicity</hi> to be attain'd either in this World or in the Next, such a <hi>Christian</hi> as this pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses it all; For he enjoys the <hi>Love,</hi> the Favour of that <hi>God,</hi> who is the Great dispenser of all Good both in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth.</p>
            <p>O the Peace and the Tranquility! The Pleasure, and the Satisfaction of that Man, who lives in such a State as this! Whose <hi>Conscience</hi> acquits him; whose <hi>Innocence</hi> supports him in the midst of Dangers; whose <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> chear his Soul, and fill it with the most excellent Comforts; whose <hi>Present Condition</hi> is <hi>full</hi> of <hi>Hope,</hi> and whose <hi>Future Prospect</hi> is to be for Ever Happy.</p>
            <p>How will such a <hi>Christian</hi> as this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over all the Miseries, and despise the Blandishments of a vain, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, sinful World? Even <hi>Death</hi> its self the last, and greatest of Terrors, will

            <p>THE Words are part of that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Application, which the <hi>Apostle</hi> here makes of his excellent Discourse concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Exercise of Christian Charity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See ch. xiv.1.</note> in that great Instance of <hi>Condescension</hi> to the <hi>Infirmities</hi> of our <hi>Weaker Brethren,</hi> in the foregoing <hi>Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Occasion</hi> of it was this:</p>
            <p>There were in those first times, many among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who tho' they were converted to the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> yet still continued <hi>zealous for the Law</hi>;<note place="margin">Acts xv.1. —xxi.20.</note> and not only carefully observed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59924:139"/>
all the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of it, but would also by any means impose upon all others also, the observance of them. And how earnest they were upon this account, and how much they hated the <hi>Gentile Converts,</hi> upon whom the <hi>Apostles</hi> did not <hi>think fit to lay any such burden,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts xv.19, 28. Gal. v.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> many Passages both in the <hi>Acts</hi> and in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Epistles,</hi> do sufficiently declare.</p>
            <p>But as in all other differences it sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom happens that the whole heat of the Controversie rests only on one side; so here, tho' the <hi>Jewish Converts</hi> were both the first beginners of this Dispute, and the more zealous pursuers of it, yet neither were the <hi>Gentile</hi> Christians ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly without fault in it; but so <hi>far stood fast in that liberty wherewith Christ had made them free,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. v.1.</note> as not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the weakness and ignorance of the others,<note place="margin">Rom. xi.18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> but to be ready almost even to cut them off from their Communion.</p>
            <p>I need not say how dangerous such a Controversie as this might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, nor what a stop it might have put to the progress of <hi>Christianity,</hi> in those first beginnings of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> Great were the difficulties which the <hi>Apostles</hi> underwent on this occasion; whilst they
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:59924:139"/>
endeavoured so to menage themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two Parties, as not only not to offend either, but, if it were possible, to bring them Both to such a temper with one another, that neither the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Convert</hi> might despise the weakness of his <hi>Judaizing</hi> Brother; nor the <hi>Jewish</hi> Votary judge too severely of the Liberty of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Christian.</p>
            <p>And this was the design of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Chapter</hi> before my <hi>Text.</hi> Where addressing himself, as indeed he seems to have done this whole <hi>Epistle,</hi> to the <hi>Gentile Christians</hi>; and whom, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the truer Notion of their <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> as to this matter, he therefore calls the <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>to bear the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the Weak</hi>; i. e. not to grieve nor despise them for their mistaken Zeal, but by complying a little, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending to their Infirmities, to endeavour, if it should please God, to draw them out of their Error. <hi>Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to Edification.</hi>

               <item>II. That these <hi>differences</hi> ought not to hinder such Persons from agreeing together not only in a <hi>common Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> but if it be possible, in a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Worship</hi> of <hi>God</hi> too.</item>
               <item>III. That to this End it is the Duty of all <hi>Christians,</hi> but especially of those who are the <hi>strong in Faith,</hi> not only to pray for such a <hi>Vnion,</hi> but, as they have opportunity, heartily to labour Themselves, and earnestly to stir up all Others, to endeavour after it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Prop. 1.</note>And, <hi>First; That there may be</hi> Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences <hi>in matters of lesser moment between very good and zealous Christians, without
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59924:141"/>
any just Reflection upon the</hi> Men, <hi>or upon their</hi> Religion.</p>
            <p>For proof of which, I think I need go no farther than the very History of my <hi>Text.</hi> I have already said how great a division there was between the <hi>Jewish</hi> and the <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts, about the <hi>Ritual Observances</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> and with what a Zeal the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting Parties</hi> managed the Dispute, till they had almost lost their <hi>Charity,</hi> and made a deplorable <hi>Schism</hi> in the <hi>Church of Christ.</hi> And yet I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident no Man will say that this was at all derogatory either to the <hi>Truth</hi> of their <hi>Common Christianity,</hi> or to the <hi>Infallible Authority</hi> with which the <hi>Apostles</hi> had deliver'd it unto them.</p>
            <p>And for the <hi>Parties</hi> themselves that thus differ'd with one another, that they had a true <hi>Zeal</hi> on both sides for the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and thought it matter of <hi>Conscience,</hi> the one to <hi>observe</hi> these <hi>Ceremonial Institutions</hi> as what God still required of them; the other to <hi>refuse</hi> any such <hi>Imposition,</hi> as not only a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Burden,<note place="margin">Act. xv.28. Gal. v.2.</note> but even repugnant to the <hi>Grace of Christ</hi> declared to them in his
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59924:142"/>
               <hi>Gospel</hi>; S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the prosecution of this very Argument, does clearly bear witness to them, Ch. xiv.6. Where he makes use of this very thing as one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why they should mutually tolerate one another in their <hi>Dissensions; viz.</hi> That however they <hi>differ'd</hi> in their <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> as to <hi>these particulars,</hi> yet they were both perfectly agreed in the same common <hi>Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and the <hi>Discharge</hi> of their <hi>Duty. He that regardeth the day,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. xiv.6.</note> 
               <hi>regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, either we must say, that all, even the least <hi>Points,</hi> relating to our <hi>Religion,</hi> are so clearly and plainly revealed, that no Honest Man can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be mistaken, if he will but impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially enquire into them; which from the <hi>Differences</hi> of whole <hi>Parties</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these things, 'tis plain they are not: Or else Men's different Capacities, and Opportunities, and Tempers, and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation consider'd, 'tis in vain to expect
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59924:142"/>
that all Good Men should agree in all their <hi>Notions</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> any more than we see they do in any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns whatsoever. And who am I, that I should dare to pronounce a Sentence of <hi>Reprobation</hi> against any one, in whom there appear all the other <hi>Characters</hi> of an humble, upright, sincere Christian, only because he has not perhaps met with the same Instruction, or read the same Books, or do's not argue the same way; In a Word, because he is not so wise, or it may be, is wiser than I am, and sees farther than I do, and therefore is not exactly of my Opinion in every thing.</p>
            <p>Now if this be so, as both the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> conclude it very well may be, and the common <hi>Experience</hi> of Mankind, not only in the particular concern of <hi>Religion,</hi> but in most other things assures us that it is: That Men's Understandings are different, and they will argue different waies, and entertain different Opinions from one another, about the same things, and yet may nevertheless deserve on all sides, to be esteemed very good and wise Men for all that: How vain then must that

            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> It is certain that amidst all our other <hi>Divisions,</hi> we are yet on all sides agreed in whatsoever is <hi>Fundamental</hi> in the <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>necessary</hi> to be <hi>believed</hi> and <hi>professed</hi> by us in order to our <hi>Salvation.</hi>

            <p>There is no good <hi>Protestant,</hi> but what does firmly believe all the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Apostles Creed</hi>; and embraces the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> as the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and <hi>Rule of his Faith,</hi> and readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges

               </note> That they <hi>agree</hi> in <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>differ only in those things that do not belong to it?</hi> Because if they <hi>differ</hi> about any Point, they for that very Reason, conclude it to be <hi>no matter of Faith.</hi> But besides the Impenitence of this Answer, which amounts to no more than this, that they <hi>do agree</hi> in what
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59924:145"/>
they <hi>do agree,</hi> and <hi>differ</hi> only in those things in which they <hi>differ:</hi> This is what we say for our selves concerning our Differences; We agree in all those things that are necessary to a <hi>Sound</hi> and <hi>Saving Faith</hi>; and if we <hi>differ</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of lesser moment, 'tis no more than what all other Christians have ever done, and what those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> it self at this day do.</p>
            <p>So that still it must remain, either that those <hi>Differences</hi> which were among the <hi>Christians</hi> of old, and which are among us now, are no <hi>Prejudice</hi> at all to the <hi>common Truth</hi> which we profess; or if they be, the Consequence will fall upon those of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> no less, that I do not say, and more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, than upon us, and be of the same Force against <hi>Their Religion,</hi> that it can be against <hi>Ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I must carry this <hi>Reflection</hi> a great deal farther; for,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If once this <hi>Principle</hi> be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, That because Men differ in some things, they ought not to be credited in any, what then will become, not only of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> as it now stands in Opposition to <hi>Popery,</hi> but even
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:59924:145"/>
of <hi>Christianity</hi> it self? For might not a <hi>Turk</hi> or a <hi>Jew,</hi> if he were minded to give himself so much trouble to so little purpose as this late <hi>Author</hi> has done, draw out a large <hi>HISTORY</hi> of the <hi>VARIATIONS</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves, from the Controversie of the <hi>Text,</hi> unto this day; and then by the very same <hi>Principle</hi> conclude against us all, That we have none of us any certain Grounds for Our <hi>Religion,</hi> because the <hi>differences</hi> that are among us, plainly shew, that some of us must be deceived? And to go yet one step far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Might not a <hi>Sceptick</hi> by the same <hi>Rule,</hi> argue against all <hi>Religion,</hi> and even against all <hi>Reason</hi> too; That the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement of mankind in these and many other <hi>Points</hi> of the greatest <hi>Importance,</hi> clearly proves that there is no <hi>certainty</hi> in any <hi>thing</hi>; and therefore that we ought not to rely either upon the <hi>one,</hi> or upon the <hi>other?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains therefore, that unless we will overthrow all the measures of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Charity</hi> towards our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and the <hi>common Truth,</hi> I do not say both of <hi>their Faith</hi> and of our own, but even of <hi>Christianity</hi> it self, nay and of all <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> in general; We
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:59924:146"/>
must conclude, That good Christians may <hi>differ</hi> from one another in matters of lesser moment, without any <hi>just Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection</hi> either upon <hi>themselves</hi> or their <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here therefore I must desire not to be misunderstood. For when I say, that Christians may, without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to themselves, or disparagement to the Truth of their Religion, <hi>differ</hi> with one another; I mean only, as the <hi>Terms</hi> of my <hi>Proposition</hi> expresly shew, in <hi>lesser matters</hi>; such as do not concern the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> nor destroy the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; nor are otherwise so <hi>clearly revealed,</hi> but that Wise and Good Men, after all their Enquiries, may still continue to <hi>differ</hi> in their <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> concerning them. For otherwise, if Interest and Prejudice blind men's Eyes, and they <hi>err</hi> because they resolve they will not be convinced; and so by their own Fault continue in Mistakes contrary to the <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and destructive of <hi>Piety</hi>: If, for instance, Men will profess to believe but in <hi>One God,</hi> and yet <hi>worship Thousands</hi>; If they will read over the <hi>second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and nevertheless both <hi>make</hi> and <hi>bow</hi> down before <hi>Graven Images</hi> in
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59924:146"/>
despite of it; If, whilst they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>Christ</hi> to have <hi>instituted</hi> the <hi>Blessed Eucharist</hi> in <hi>both kinds,</hi> they <hi>command</hi> it to be <hi>administred</hi> but in <hi>One</hi>; and <hi>pray</hi> in an <hi>unknown Tongue,</hi> tho' S. <hi>Paul</hi> has spent almost a whole Chapter to shew the Folly and Unreasonableness of it: These are <hi>Errors</hi> in which I am not concerned; and tho I should be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, even here, at all adventures to <hi>pronounce</hi> any <hi>Sentence</hi> against the <hi>Men</hi>; yet I must needs say, <hi>That Religion</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be very sound, which stands <hi>corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted</hi> with so many, and such <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Abuses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this makes the difference between those <hi>Errors</hi> for which we <hi>separate</hi> from the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and those <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies</hi> which sometimes arise among <hi>Protestants</hi> themselves. The former are in matters of the greatest consequence, such as tend directly to overthrow the <hi>Integrity</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Purity</hi> of our <hi>Worship</hi>; and therefore such as are in their own nature <hi>destructive</hi> of the very <hi>Essentials</hi> of <hi>Christianity.</hi> Whereas our Differences do not at all concern the <hi>Foundations</hi> either of <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Worship</hi>; and are therefore such in which Good Men, if they be otherwise <hi>diligent</hi> and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:59924:147"/>
               <hi>sincere</hi> in their <hi>Enquiry,</hi> may <hi>differ,</hi> without any Prejudice to themselves, or any <hi>just Reflection</hi> upon the <hi>Truth</hi> of their <hi>common Profession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which being thus cleared, in <hi>answer</hi> to the little Endeavours of one of the latest of our <hi>Adversaries</hi> against us upon this Account; I go on, <hi>Secondly,</hi> to shew,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Prop. 2.</note>
               <hi>Secondly, That such</hi> differences <hi>as these, ought not to hinder such persons from agreeing together, not only in a</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Charity; <hi>but, if it be possible, in a</hi> common Worship <hi>of</hi> God <hi>too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is what S. <hi>Paul</hi> here expresly <hi>exhorts</hi> these <hi>dissenting Christians</hi> to, and earnestly <hi>praies</hi> to <hi>God</hi> that he might see accomplished in them. That when they came together to the <hi>publick Offices</hi> of the Church, to offer up their <hi>common Prayers</hi> and <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> to Him, they might do it, not only in the <hi>same Form of Words,</hi> but with the <hi>same Affection of Mind</hi> too, both towards <hi>God,</hi> and towards <hi>one another: Now the God of patience and consolation, grant you to be</hi> like-minded <hi>one towards another, according to Christ Jesus; that ye may
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:59924:147"/>
with</hi> one Mind <hi>and</hi> one Mouth <hi>glorifie God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such was their <hi>Duty</hi> to one another then; and we ought certainly no less to esteem the same to be our Duty towards one another now: And</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the business of <hi>Charity</hi>;</p>
            <p>God forbid that any <hi>Differences</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> whatsoever, much less such little ones as those we are now speaking of, should ever make us deny that to our fellow Christians. 'Tis true indeed, our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> once foretold to his <hi>Disciples,</hi> That there should rise up Men from among their <hi>Brethren,</hi> who should upon this account not only <hi>put them out of their Synagogues,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. xvi.2.</note> but even think that it was a matter of Religion to <hi>kill them.</hi> But they were <hi>Jews,</hi> not <hi>Christians,</hi> who were to do this; and He expresly adds, That 'twas their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of Him and his Religion that should carry them on to so furious and intemperate a Zeal; <hi>For these things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">— V. 3.</note> saies he, <hi>shall they do unto you, because they have not known the</hi> Father <hi>nor</hi> Me. And we must confess it, to the scandal of our <hi>Holy Religion,</hi> that there are a
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:59924:148"/>
sort of Men who call themselves <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> now, that still continue to fulfil this <hi>Prophecy</hi> in the very Letter of it; who not only <hi>cast us out of their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, that</hi> we should not much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of; and, as far as in them lies, cut us off from all the Hopes of <hi>Salvation</hi> too; but, to compleat the parallel, openly arm the whole World against us, and teach Men to believe, that 'tis a Work of <hi>Piety</hi> to root us out of it; and therefore, that <hi>whosoever killeth us, does do God service.</hi> But in this, as well as in the rest of their <hi>Errors,</hi> they give us but the more effectually to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how little they have in them of the <hi>true Spirit of Christianity</hi>; for sure such things as these they could never do, but only that, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> in that other <hi>case</hi> before said, <hi>they have not known the Father nor Him.</hi> And I hope I shall need no Argument to perswade you not to be mis-led by that, which we all of us so justly lament, as one of the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Corruptions even of <hi>Popery</hi> it self.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christianity</hi> commands us to <hi>love our Enemies,</hi> and sure then we cannot but think it very highly reasonable not to <hi>hate our Brethren</hi>; but especially on
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:59924:148"/>
such an account, as, if it be once admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, will in this <hi>divided state</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> utterly drive the very name of <hi>brotherly Love</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> out of it: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by whatsoever Arguments we shall go about to justifie our <hi>uncharitableness</hi> to any Others, they will all equally war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant them to with-hold in like manner their <hi>Charity</hi> from us.</p>
            <p>There is no honest, sincere Christian, how <hi>erroneous</hi> soever he may be, but what at least is perswaded that he is in the right; and looks upon Us to be as far from the Truth by differing from him, as We esteem Him for not agreeing with us. Now if upon the sole account of such Differences it be lawful for us to <hi>hate</hi> Another; we must for the very same Reason allow it to be as lawful for Him also to <hi>hate</hi> Us. Thus shall we at once invert the <hi>Characteristick</hi> of our Religion;<note place="margin">Joh. xiii.35.</note> 
               <hi>By this shall all men know that ye are my Disciples, if ye have love one to another</hi>; and turn it into the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>Note</hi>: Whilst we make our <hi>hatred</hi> to our <hi>Brother</hi> the great mark of our <hi>Zeal</hi> for our <hi>Religion</hi>; and conclude him to <hi>love Christ</hi> the <hi>most,</hi> who the <hi>least loves his fellow Christian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:59924:149"/>How much rather ought we to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, with our <hi>Apostle,</hi> the <hi>love</hi> of our dear <hi>Master</hi> to us, even whilst we were yet his <hi>Enemies,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> those whom we ought to hope, notwithstanding all their <hi>Errors,</hi> are yet still his <hi>Friends</hi>; and not think those unworthy of our <hi>Charity,</hi> whom we piously presume <hi>God</hi> will not think unworthy of his <hi>Favour?</hi> We suppose them to be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in those things wherein they differ from us, and perhaps they are so; but yet we must consider, that we our selves also are but Men, and therefore may err; and They as verily think Us in the wrong, as we do Them: And, for ought I know, we must leave it to the Day of Judgment to decide the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, which of us is in the right. In the mean time, if they are mistaken, I am sure our <hi>uncharitableness</hi> is not the way to convince them of their <hi>Error</hi>: but may rather indispose them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the weight of our <hi>Arguments</hi> as they ought, whilst they see so little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard in our <hi>Affections</hi> towards them. In short, if we are indeed, what we esteem our selves to be, <hi>the strong in the Faith,</hi> let us then remember, that tho' <hi>Charity</hi> be <hi>their Duty</hi> too as well as <hi>ours,</hi> yet 'tis
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:59924:149"/>
to such as We are, especially, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> addresses the <hi>Exhortation</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 1.7.</note> 
               <hi>to bear the Infirmities of the Weak</hi>; and <hi>to receive one another, as Christ also hath recived us, to the Glory of God.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such <hi>Differences</hi> as these, ought not only not to lessen our <hi>Charity,</hi> but, if it be possible, not to hinder us from joyning together in the same common <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>God</hi> with one another.</p>
            <p>This was what these <hi>dissenting Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> notwithstanding all their Heats and Contentions, nevertheless still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to do. They did <hi>with one Mouth glorifie God,</hi> even when their Differences would not suffer them to do it with <hi>one Heart.</hi> They united together in a <hi>common Worship</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> tho' they could not unite either in Opinion or Affection with one another.</p>
            <p>Indeed where Mens <hi>Errors</hi> are such as do utterly subvert the very <hi>Essentials</hi> of our <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> it is there in vain to hope for any <hi>Communion</hi> in the <hi>Publick Service</hi> of God with them. We must not destroy the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi> out of a Zeal to enlarge the <hi>Communion</hi> of <hi>Christians.</hi> He would
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59924:150"/>
be a very condescending Votary indeed, who for the sake of <hi>praying</hi> to <hi>God</hi> with the <hi>Papist,</hi> would <hi>pray</hi> to the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> too with him: Who rather than be excluded their <hi>Churches,</hi> would <hi>bow down</hi> before their <hi>Images</hi>; and not only <hi>worship</hi> their <hi>Host,</hi> but even give up his Right to the <hi>Cup</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> only that he might receive that holy Sacrament in their Company. It is, no doubt, a very desirable thing to <hi>lessen</hi> the <hi>differences</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> and enlarge their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> as far as ever we can: And it has never gone well with the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> since Men have been so narrow-spirited as to mix the <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> with their <hi>Publick Forms</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi>; and have made their <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies,</hi> instead of being <hi>Offices</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to God,</hi> become <hi>Tests</hi> and <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> of the <hi>Opinions</hi> of their <hi>Brethren.</hi> But yet when all is done, the <hi>Truths</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> must not be sacrificed to the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi>; nor the <hi>Honour</hi> of God be given up, to keep up a <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> with one another.</p>
            <p>But where Mens <hi>Differences</hi> are in <hi>Points</hi> that do not at all affect their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Service</hi>; or not so much, but
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59924:150"/>
that <hi>God</hi> may be very well <hi>worshipp'd,</hi> and yet <hi>Communion</hi> with our <hi>fellow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> preserved too; in such cases as this, our <hi>dissentions</hi> ought not only not to lessen our <hi>Charity,</hi> but not to break our <hi>Vnity</hi> neither: We may continue to differ, as the <hi>Christians</hi> in my Text did; and yet <hi>with one Mind, and one Mouth, glorifie God,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted them to do.</p>
            <p>And this brings me to the <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Last Point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, That to this End,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prop. 3.</note> 
               <hi>it is the Duty of all of us, but especially of the</hi> stronger Christians, <hi>not only to</hi> Pray <hi>for such a</hi> Union, <hi>but also, as they have opportunity, heartily to labour</hi> themselves, <hi>and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to stir up all</hi> others <hi>to</hi> endeavour <hi>after it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not believe there is any <hi>good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> so little affected with those unhappy Divisions under which the <hi>Church</hi> at this day labours, as not both heartily to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore them, and to think that nothing could be too much, that might inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently be done on all hands, for the redressing of them. But then I am sure the natural Consequence of this must be, what both my <hi>Text,</hi> and this
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59924:151"/>
               <hi>Discourse</hi> are designed to exhort you to; <hi>viz.</hi> That we ought every one of us, not only heartily to <hi>pray</hi> for such a <hi>Vnion</hi>; but also, as we have opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, earnestly to labour for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.</p>
            <p>Indeed for what concerns the whole Body of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> on Earth, so many are the Disputes that have arisen among the several Parties and Communions of it, and some of them in <hi>Points</hi> so near to the Foundations of Christianity, that whilst Men resolve to keep fast to their Conclusions, and will not suffer the plainest Arguments to convince them of their <hi>Errors,</hi> 'tis in vain to hope ever to see things brought to such a <hi>Temper,</hi> as we could wish in that. But especially whilst that part which is the most corrupt, is so far from being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to concur to any such <hi>Vnion,</hi> that on the contrary, she has cut off all possibility of attaining it: And by arrogating an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable <hi>Infallibility</hi> to her self, and <hi>Authority</hi> over all others, will neither <hi>reform</hi> her own <hi>Abuses,</hi> nor admit any into her <hi>Communion,</hi> that will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the same <hi>Errors,</hi> in which she her self stands involved. So that here, all we can even wish for, is, that Men
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59924:151"/>
would at last be so wise, as tho' they differ in <hi>Opinion,</hi> yet to <hi>love</hi> as <hi>Brethren,</hi> and agree together in a <hi>common Charity,</hi> till we shall be so happy as to <hi>unite</hi> in a <hi>common Faith</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for us whom it has pleased <hi>God,</hi> by delivering us from the <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Superstitions</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> to unite together in the common name of <hi>Protestant, Reformed Christians,</hi> would we but as heartily labour after <hi>Peace,</hi> as we are all of us very highly exhorted to it; I cannot see why we who are so happily joyn'd together in a <hi>common profession of the same Faith,</hi> at least, I am sure in all the <hi>necessary Points</hi> of it; and I hope amidst all our <hi>lesser Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,</hi> in a <hi>common love and charity to one another,</hi> should not also be united in the same <hi>common Worship</hi> of God too.</p>
            <p>I will not now enter into any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute, to shew how little reason there is for any one to <hi>separate</hi> from the <hi>Offices</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of those few Exceptions that have sometimes been offer'd to justifie the doing of it. This is a work both too large for such a Discourse; and besides the design of my present Undertaking.

And that one Concession of many of our <hi>Brethren</hi> themselves, who tho' they continue <hi>ordinarily</hi> to <hi>separate</hi> from us, yet nevertheless freely allow of what they call <hi>Occasional Communion</hi> with us, I think sufficiently shews how little real ground there is for those <hi>Scruples,</hi> that have so long detain'd them in an unjust aversion to our Worship. Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be <hi>God,</hi> who has abundantly justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied both the Purity of our <hi>Doctrin,</hi> and the Innocency of our <hi>Worship,</hi> not only by the general Approbation of the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> abroad, who both freely <hi>communicate</hi> with us in our <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Offices,</hi> and have often given Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony in favour of them; but in the happy Conviction of many at Home, who were once <hi>Enemies</hi> to our Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but who now go with us into the same <hi>House of God as Friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed the things for which some forsake us now, are no other than what they were in the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi>; when yet there was no such thing as <hi>Separation</hi> from our <hi>Communion</hi>: But on the contrary, the old <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> themselves, tho' they disliked some things in our <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> yet freely declared they thought
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59924:152"/>
it a Crime to <hi>divide</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> on the account of them. And they who at this day <hi>separate</hi> from us, for the sake of those few <hi>Constitutions</hi> that have been made for the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decency</hi> of our <hi>Publick Worship,</hi> must for the same reason have <hi>separated</hi> from all the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Christian World,</hi> for above 1500 years; in none of which they might not have found as great, that I do not say, and much greater, occasion of <hi>Offence,</hi> than they can in Ours.</p>
            <p>But yet, since Mens <hi>Scruples</hi> are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, and after all that can be said, they will still differ even about <hi>indifferent</hi> things, and be <hi>afraid</hi> many times, where <hi>no Fear is</hi>; and a too long Experience has already shewn us, That if ever we mean to accomplish that <hi>Union</hi> so much recommended to us by our <hi>Apostle,</hi> so advantagious to the Church at all times, but especially at this time so necessary to our Peace and our Establishment, that it seems to be the only way that yet remains to settle and to secure us; and upon all these accounts, so much to be desired by all Good Men, we must seek it by that Rule which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here proposed to

the Dissenting Christians of my <hi>Text, We then that are strong in the faith,</hi>

               <hi>ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please our selves.</hi> I cannot but think it a Reflection becoming every good Christian among us, but in a more especial manner, worthy the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of such an <hi>Auditory</hi> as this, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther somewhat may not yet be done for the sake of Peace, and to bring things to such a <note n="*" place="margin">See the <hi>Petition</hi> of the <hi>Archbishop</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> to King <hi>James</hi>

               <hi>and took upon Him the form of a servant, and being made in the likeness of a sinful man, humbled Himself even to the Death upon the Cross for us?</hi> How He still bears not only with our <hi>Infirmities,</hi> but with our <hi>Sins</hi> too; and by all these wonderful instances of his <hi>Love</hi> to us, teacheth us, says St. <hi>John, How we ought also to love one another?</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:59924:153"/>Or rather, shall I shew you, how far such a Blessed <hi>Vnion</hi> as this, would conduce to the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to the <hi>Security</hi> of <hi>our Religion,</hi> and to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> among us?</p>
            <p>I need not say what a dishonour our <hi>Divisions</hi> have already brought to the <hi>Reformation,</hi> nor what a stop they have put to the <hi>progress</hi> of it Great, to be sure, is the <hi>Advantage</hi> which our <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> either have, or at least hoped to have made, by those Contests which they have taken so much pains both to <hi>bring in,</hi> and to <hi>keep up</hi> among us: And methinks there should need no other Argument to stir up every true Friend to the name of <hi>Protestant,</hi> to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour all he can to compose our <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,</hi> than this one thing, That we are sufficiently convinced who they are that we <hi>please,</hi> and whose <hi>Interests</hi> we serve, by the continuance of them.</p>
            <p>Let us add to this, what great Obligations our Holy Religion lays up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us,<note place="margin">Rom. xiv.19.</note> to <hi>follow after those things that make for peace, and whereby we may edifie one another:</hi> How our Saviour has set it down as the very Badge of our Discipleship;

               <hi>To mark them which cause divisions and offences, contrary to the Doctrine which we have learnt, and avoid them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With what a scrupulous care did St. <hi>Paul</hi> manage himself between the <hi>dissenting parties</hi> in my <hi>Text?</hi> What admirable <hi>Rules</hi> did he lay down for them to walk by? And with what an affectionate <hi>earnestness</hi> did he enforce them?<note place="margin">Phil. ii.1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>If there be any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of Love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any Bowels and Mercies, fulfil ye my joy, that ye be</hi> like-minded, <hi>having the</hi> same Love, <hi>being of</hi> one Accord, <hi>of</hi> one Mind.</p>
            <p>And may I not beg leave, tho' not with the <hi>Authority,</hi> yet with the <hi>Charity</hi> of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to apply all this to those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy <hi>Divisions</hi> that at this day rend in pieces the Church of Christ among us; and beseech you, by all these endearing Considerations, to pursue those things which may make for our <hi>Peace</hi>; and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59924:154"/>
for the closing of those <hi>breaches,</hi> which the malice of our <hi>Enemies</hi> too successfully begun, and our own <hi>weakness</hi> has too fatally kept up among us.</p>
            <p>Never, certainly, was there a time, since the name of <hi>Separation</hi> was first heard of among us, in which we had greater reason to consider of such a <hi>Vnion</hi>; or, I hope, a fairer opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to promise our selves an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of it. Only let us be on all hands as careful to improve it, as I am persuaded we have all of us not only seem'd to desire, but have indeed ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly long'd for it.</p>
            <p>Let us shew the sense we have of that wonderful <hi>Deliverance</hi> God has given us out of the <hi>hand</hi> of our <hi>Enemies,</hi> by <hi>uniting</hi> our selves in the strictest League of <hi>Friendship</hi> with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have defended our <hi>Church</hi> by our <hi>Arguments</hi>; let us now by our <hi>Charity</hi> settle and establish it, against the like <hi>Dangers</hi> for the time to come.</p>
            <p>This will indeed render both our <hi>selves</hi> and our <hi>Religion</hi> Glorious to the World; and may be a Happy <hi>Augury</hi> that the <hi>blessed time</hi> so long wrapped

up in <hi>sacred Prophecy,</hi> is indeed now ready to be revealed: When the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> being purged from those <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions</hi> that have so long defaced its Beauty, shall again appear in its <hi>primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Purity.</hi> When all <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Schism</hi> being every where abolished, and the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> laid fully open, and the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> destroyed; true Religion and sincere Piety shall again reign throughout the World; <hi>God himself shall pitch his Tabernacle among us,</hi>

            <p>O Blessed State of the Church Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant here on Earth! the glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tepast of that Peace and Piety which <hi>God</hi> has prepared for his <hi>Church Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant</hi> in <hi>Heaven!</hi> Who would not wish to see those days, when a general <hi>Reformation,</hi> and a true <hi>Zeal,</hi> and a <hi>perfect Charity,</hi> passing through the World, we should All be united in the same <hi>Faith,</hi> the same <hi>Worship,</hi> the same <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>Fellowship</hi> one with another? When all <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Prejudice,</hi> all <hi>Interests</hi> and <hi>Designs</hi> being submitted to the Honour of God, and the discharge of our Duty, the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> shall again triumph over the vain <hi>Traditions</hi>

of Men; and <hi>Religion</hi> no longer take its denomination from little <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Factions,</hi> but we shall all be content with the same common primitive <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> and live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as becomes our Character, in <hi>Brotherly Love</hi> and <hi>Christian Charity</hi> with one another?</p>
            <p>And who can tell but such a <hi>Change</hi> as this, and which we have otherwise some reason to believe is nigh at hand, may even now break forth from the midst of us, would we but all seriously labour to perfect the Great Work which the Providence of God has so gloriously begun among us, and establish that <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> among our selves, which may afterwards diffuse it self from us into all the other Parts of the <hi>Christian World</hi> besides?</p>
            <p>But however, whether we shall ever see, I do not say, such a Blessed <hi>Effect</hi> as this, but even any good Effect at all of our Endeavours here on <hi>Earth,</hi> or no; yet this we are sure, we shall not lose our Reward in <hi>Heaven.</hi> When to have contributed, tho' in the least degree, to the healing of those <hi>divisions</hi> we so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily labour under, shall be esteemed a greater Honour, than to have <hi>silenced</hi>

all the Cavils of our <hi>Enemies</hi>; and even to have pray'd, and wish'd for it, and, where we could not any otherwise have contributed our selves, but to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted others to it, shall be rewarded with <hi>Blessings, more than all the Stars in the Firmament for number.</hi>

even now at the last, return with a true Zeal, and a sincere Affection to their Duty, they should not fail to meet with a favourable acceptance from him:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore also now saith the</hi> LORD, <hi>Turn ye even to me, with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: and rent your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the</hi> LORD <hi>your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not my intention to seek a a Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel of all this, either in the <hi>sins,</hi> or in the <hi>danger</hi> of our own Country. I would willingly hope, that neither our <hi>Guilt,</hi> nor our <hi>Incorrigibleness</hi> have been so heinous as theirs, nor shall any such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable <hi>Judgment</hi> as this, ever, I trust, be made the punishment of what our Iniquities have indeed but too justly deserved. No, blessed be <hi>God,</hi> who by a wonderful Concurrence of great and singular Mercies, seems rather to call upon us to celebrate his Goodness, than to deprecate his Judgments; to praise his Name in <hi>Hymns</hi> of Triumph and Eucharist, than to <hi>weep between the Porch
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:59924:160"/>
and the Altar,</hi> in melancholy <hi>Litanies</hi> to avert his Anger, and implore his Mercy. But yet since the <hi>Goodness,</hi> as well as <hi>Judgments</hi> of the Lord, are designed to bring us to <hi>repentance,</hi> and that whether we look back into our own particular Actions, or consider those Publick and National Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, whereby we have so long and loudly call'd to Heaven for vengeance; we must with shame and indignation confess our selves some of the greatest of Sinners; I cannot but think, both the Solemn Occasion of <hi>this Day,</hi> and the Design of my <hi>Text,</hi> to be a most proper and seasonable Admonition to us, to <hi>turn unto the Lord our God,</hi> and to implore his Blessing upon our present Enterprises, that those vile <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects,</hi> the <hi>Locusts</hi> and <hi>Caterpillars,</hi> that have so barbarously consumed our Neighbours round about us; our worse than <hi>Assyrian</hi> or <hi>Babylonian</hi> Enemies, may not be able to prevail against us.</p>
               <p>And indeed, however it has pleased God, as at this time, to give us some Encouragement to <hi>trust in his Mercy</hi>; yet we cannot so soon forget, that we have also born the punishment of our <hi>sins.</hi> For not to repass upon the things
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:59924:160"/>
that are at a greater distance from us; let the Instances still fresh in all our Memories, speak to us: What just Apprehensions did we but very lately lye under of our <hi>Lives,</hi> and of what is yet dearer to us than our <hi>Lives,</hi> our <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> and our <hi>Religion?</hi> How did our Enemies not only project our Ruin, but as if it were already accomplished, begin to say in their hearts, nay, they began freely to speak it out to us; <hi>Aha! so would we have it:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. lxxi.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Persecute them, and take them; for there is none to deliver them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if now we are no longer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to those dangers that <hi>so lately</hi> threatned us; if God has begun, upon our late more serious concern for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and more general return to him, to give us some Testimony of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Designations towards us; This certainly ought to be so far from lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our <hi>solemn Humiliation</hi> at this time, that it should rather engage us to be the more forward in perfecting our <hi>Repentance,</hi> the greater Encouragement we have to hope, that it shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted at our hands.

               <p>I begin with the <hi>former</hi> of these, the <hi>Exhortation</hi> of my <hi>Text</hi>:
<q>
                     <hi>I.</hi> To <hi>turn</hi> unto the <hi>LORD</hi> your God with <hi>all</hi> your <hi>heart,</hi> and with <hi>fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and with <hi>weeping,</hi> and with <hi>mourning.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And here I presume I shall not need to tell you, That all this is but a larger Paraphrase of what I may in other <hi>Words</hi> call a <hi>General</hi> and <hi>National Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> of those <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>National Sins</hi> which had provoked <hi>God Almighty</hi> to send down so many Judgments upon them, and to threaten them with yet grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if they continued still in their <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence.</hi> And indeed, what could be more reasonable, than by such a Solemn and Universal Acknowledgment both
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59924:162"/>
of the <hi>Evils</hi> they had committed, and of the Judgments which they deserved, and of the <hi>sorrow</hi> they were now touch'd with for their Offences; to appease <hi>God</hi>'s Anger for that General Incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibleness, by which they had so long exposed both his <hi>Goodness</hi> and his <hi>Justice</hi> to Contempt, among the Heathen round about him?</p>
               <p>For however it be very certain, that all the <hi>outward pomp</hi> and <hi>solemnity</hi> of <hi>Repentance,</hi> the <hi>fasting,</hi> and the <hi>weeping,</hi> and the <hi>mourning,</hi> are at best but a <hi>form of Godliness,</hi> empty and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, unless there be also added to these that <hi>true inward change of Mind,</hi> in which alone consists <hi>the Power of it</hi>; yet there may be such Circumstances and Cases put, wherein this Duty must pass beyond the <hi>Heart</hi> and the <hi>Closet</hi>: and the Humiliation will be imperfect, if it be not as <hi>publickly</hi> set forth to the <hi>Eyes of Men,</hi> as it is <hi>sincerely</hi> perform'd in the <hi>sight of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And such especially must be the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> for <hi>National</hi> Sins. Where Mens <hi>Transgressions</hi> have been <hi>open</hi> and <hi>notorious,</hi> there their <hi>Return</hi> also must be no less <hi>Solemn</hi> and <hi>Evident</hi>; that so the Honour as well as Justice of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59924:162"/>
God may be vindicated in their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness; and some sort of Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made not only for the Guilt which they have contracted, but also for the Scandal which they have given to his Honour and Religion in the World.</p>
               <p>Now 'tis this which at once both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the <hi>Piety,</hi> and commands the <hi>publick Humiliation</hi> of THIS DAY. And for the due discharge whereof, I must intreat you to go along with me in these following Reflections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That though, as I have just now shewn, there must be the <hi>publick marks</hi> of <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Humiliation</hi> in our <hi>publick Repentance,</hi> yet we must by no means stop in these; nor thinks that this is all that God requires of us in order to our Forgiveness.</p>
               <p>This was indeed the Vanity of the <hi>Jews</hi> heretofore, and is too much the folly of some misguided <hi>Christians</hi> now.</p>
               <p>Their Indignation against their Sins, and against themselves for having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them, was spent especially in the outward appearance of Sorrow: <hi>They rent their cloaths,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. iii.31.</note> 
                  <hi>and put on sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth;
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:59924:163"/>
they wept,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. xxi.27.</note> 
                  <hi>and fasted, and went softly</hi>; and then they supposed they had done their business; though it may be their Souls were not yet humbled; nor their Hearts at all <hi>broken</hi> with any true <hi>Contrition</hi> for their <hi>Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so among those of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> at this day. If we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve some of their greatest Casuists, an <hi>external Worship</hi> is sufficient to carry a Man to Heaven, without the trouble of the true <hi>inward Devotion</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi>: He may <hi>repent</hi> without <hi>Contrition</hi>; may <hi>fast</hi> with a full <hi>Meal:</hi> Nay, and if the <hi>Pope</hi> pleases, <note n="(c)" place="margin">This Passage is so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, that I ought to give some Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it.

No, it is not so much as once mentioned among the Reasons of it. It was the <hi>Reformation of their Lives</hi> that tied up his Hand. and sheathed his Sword, ver. 10. <hi>And God saw their Works, that they turn'd from their Evil way; and God repented of the Evil that he said he would do unto them, and he did it not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And this brings me to a second Remark for the farther clearing of this great Duty, <hi>viz.</hi> That not only these <hi>outward marks</hi> of <hi>penitence</hi> are not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59924:165"/>
to the discharge of it, but though we should to these add a <hi>true and real sorrow of heart</hi> for the Sins we have committed, even this would not be sufficient to purchase our Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>Now by <hi>true sorrow,</hi> I do not mean that little <hi>imperfect sorrow,</hi> which looks rather to the danger of our Condition, than to the heinousness of our Offences; and bewails our Transgressions more out of an apprehension of those Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that may be the Consequence of them, than out of any real regret that we have sinned against a most Gracious and Merciful God. For however those of the other <hi>Communion,</hi> out of their great tenderness to Sinners, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared such a <hi>sorrow</hi> as this, if accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with <hi>Confession,</hi> to be sufficient <note n="*" place="margin">Conc.

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59924:165"/>
Sin, but that</hi> Attrition <hi>is sufficient, though a Man knows it to be no more:</hi> Yet I suppose it needless in this place to obviate any such gross <hi>Error,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever otherwise of very great danger, in the Practice of this Duty. Be the <hi>sorrow for sin</hi> never so sincere; and our <hi>Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions</hi> thereupon no more to return to the Commission of it never so firm and well grounded, yet if instead of making good these Resolutions we shall stop here, we are but half Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; seeing we yet want that change of life, which alone is able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the Nature, and render the Practice of our Repentance acceptable unto God, and available to our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In short, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if we will truly discharge that <hi>Repentance,</hi> to which we are here called, we must do it not by being <hi>sorry</hi> for our <hi>Sins,</hi> or by <hi>resolving</hi> against them, but by an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual <hi>forsaking</hi> of them; i. e. as our <hi>Text</hi> speaks, <hi>By turning unto the</hi> Lord <hi>our</hi> God.

                  <hi>Heart</hi>: Words very Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, and which offer to us two great <hi>Conditions,</hi> which are absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to render our <hi>Conversion</hi> every way such as it ought to be. <hi>First,</hi> That it must be <hi>hearty</hi> and <hi>sincere</hi>: There must be nothing of the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> mix'd with it; our Souls must go along with our outward Performances; and these <hi>penitential appearances</hi> be the true Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations of that <hi>real, inward sorrow,</hi> which we feel in our Hearts for our Offences. For <hi>God</hi> is not a <hi>Man,</hi>

<pb n="315" facs="tcp:59924:166"/>
ever committing <hi>any</hi> for the time to come;<note place="margin">Hab. i.13.</note> 
                  <hi>For God is of purer Eyes than to behold the least Iniquity</hi>; and if our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> be sincere, so shall we be too. The same Piety which moves us to hate any Evil, will equally fill us with an Aversion against all. And if we desire to continue but in <hi>one Offence,</hi> it is because that we do truly <hi>repent</hi> of <hi>none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that now then if we will answer the design of <hi>this day</hi>; if we will render our <hi>Fast</hi> such as the <hi>Lord has chosen,</hi> and has promised to reward with the <hi>Blessings</hi> both of <hi>this life,</hi> and of that which is to come, we must not think it enough that we comply with the outward Ceremonies and shew of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> but we must indeed resolve to bring forth the Fruits of it. Whilst we address our selves to God for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, we must take heed to dispose our Souls in such a manner, that we may be fit to receive it.</p>
               <p>And if we thus improve the great Solemnity of <hi>this day,</hi> we shall not fail to meet with a favourable acceptance at <hi>the Throne of Grace. God will be jealous for his land, and pity his People:</hi>

               </q>
               <p>It is not at all needful for me to enter on any particular <hi>Explication</hi> of all these <hi>Attributes,</hi> and shew what <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi> every one of them affords to engage us to <hi>Repentance.</hi> Two things
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:59924:167"/>
in <hi>general</hi> there are, which will at first sight arise from them to excite us to it; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> of God to the greatest <hi>Sinners</hi> upon their <hi>Repentance</hi>:
<q>God is <hi>Gracious</hi> and <hi>Merciful,</hi> and of great <hi>Kindness.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> His <hi>unwillingness</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce any Judgments at all against them, and his readiness to <hi>recal</hi> them, if they <hi>repent</hi>:
<q>He is <hi>slow</hi> to <hi>Anger,</hi> and <hi>repenteth</hi> him of the <hi>Evil.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>First,</hi> Of the <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> of God to the <hi>Greatest</hi> of <hi>Sinners</hi> upon their <hi>Repentance</hi>:
<q>He is <hi>Gracious</hi> and <hi>Merciful,</hi> and of great <hi>Kindness.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>God</hi> proclaimed his own <hi>Name</hi> in the midst of the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> we read <hi>Exod.</hi> xxxiv. that he chose to do it, not so much in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Attributes of his <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> as in the soft <hi>Idea</hi>s of his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Goodness: The</hi> Lord, <hi>the</hi> Lord God,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:59924:168"/>
                  <hi>Merciful and Gracious,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exodus xxxiv.6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>long-suffering, and abundant in Goodness and Truth; keeping Mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin.</hi> And if we look into all the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations which he makes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, whether by his <hi>Holy Prophets</hi> under the <hi>Legal,</hi> but especially by our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> under the <hi>Christian Dispensation,</hi> we shall find there is no <hi>Character</hi> he so much delights in, as this of <hi>being Good and Gracious, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to Repentance,</hi> 2 Pet. iii.8.</p>
               <p>And now what more forcible Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement can any one desire to bring him to <hi>Repentance,</hi> than to be thus assured of the <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> of God to the greatest of Sinners, if they <hi>Repent</hi>? That he will not only forgive him upon his return, but will even assist him with <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> in the doing of it. That he <hi>desires not the death</hi> of the most profligate Offender, <hi>but rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live.</hi> In a word, That he has promised <hi>forgiveness,</hi> without exception, to the most wicked Men upon their <hi>Repentance</hi>; so that if they
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:59924:168"/>
will but <hi>yet break off their evil Course, and keep his Statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, they shall surely live, they shall not die,</hi> Ezek. xviii.21.</p>
               <p>Many are the ways, and excellent the Methods that God has taken to convince us of his Mercy, and the time would fail me to enter on a particular Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he declares not only that he is <hi>ready</hi> to <hi>pardon</hi> us if we <hi>repent,</hi> but that he even desires we should <hi>repent,</hi> that he may <hi>forgive</hi> us. And lest his <hi>Word</hi> should not be sufficient, he confirms that <hi>desire</hi> with an <hi>Oath,</hi> Ezek xxxiii.11. <hi>As I live, saith the</hi> Lord God, <hi>I have no pleasure in the death of the Wicked, but that the Wicked turn from his way and live: Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways, for why will ye die, O House of Israel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes he <hi>Expostulates</hi> with us in the way of <hi>Reasoning,</hi> to see if by that means he may be able to bring us to consider his Love and Affection to us, <hi>Isai.</hi> i.16. <hi>Wash ye, make ye clean,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isai. i.16,</note> 
                  <hi>put away the Evil of your doings from before mine Eyes; cease to do evil, learn to do well. Come now,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">— 17.</note> 
                  <hi>and let us reason together, saith the</hi> Lord: <hi>Though
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:59924:169"/>
your Sins be as Scarlet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isai, i.18.</note> 
                  <hi>they shall be white as Snow; though they be red like Crimson, they shall be as Wool.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he Exhorts us to <hi>Repentance,</hi> he always does it upon this <hi>Promise,</hi> That he will <hi>Pardon</hi> us, if we <hi>repent. If we turn from our Sins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. xviii 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Iniquity shall not be our ruine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he threatens <hi>Judgments,</hi> yet still he keeps a reserve for <hi>Mercy</hi> to triumph over <hi>Judgment</hi>; and will rather be thought inconstant in his most perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory Decrees, than inexorable to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting Sinners.</hi> Thus he commanded <hi>Jonah</hi> to go to <hi>Niniveh,</hi> and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce an utter Destruction against it. He fix'd the very <hi>time</hi> too,<note place="margin">Jonah iii.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Yet forty days, and Niniveh shall be overthrown.</hi> But what now was the issue of all this? Were they utterly destroy'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Prophecy? Nay, but on the contrary, <hi>God</hi> was yet <hi>intreated</hi> for them, and <hi>spar'd</hi> them. So we read, ver. 10. the <hi>City believed, and feared God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">— 10.</note> 
                  <hi>and turn'd from their Evil way: And God repented of the Evil that he said he would do unto them, and he did it not,</hi> Jonah 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:59924:169"/>And what must the Consequence of all these <hi>Reflections</hi> be, but to engage us not to despise the Goodness of God, whereby he thus graciously invites us to <hi>Repentance</hi>; but to conclude with Holy <hi>David,</hi> Psal. cxxx.3. <hi>If thou,</hi> LORD, <hi>shouldst be extream to mark what is done amiss; O</hi> God, <hi>who may abide it? But there is Mercy with thee, therefore shalt thou be feared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what I have now said of <hi>Gods</hi>'s <hi>mercy</hi> in General, will yet more hold in the other Part of this <hi>Character,</hi> wherein is set out to us in Particular,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> His great unwillingness to pronounce any <hi>Judgments</hi> at all against <hi>Sinners,</hi> and his readiness to recall them upon their <hi>Repentance</hi>:
<q>He is <hi>slow</hi> to <hi>Anger,</hi> and <hi>repenteth</hi> him of the <hi>Evil.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And because I would now, were I able, speak not so much to your <hi>Reason,</hi> as to your <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,</hi> to your <hi>Consciences</hi> and <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>; I will for the Proof of this, no more lead you back to the <hi>Israelites</hi> in this <hi>Prophecy</hi>; to <hi>Past-times,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known <hi>Countries</hi>; but will rather desire
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59924:170"/>
you to consider your own <hi>Times,</hi> your own <hi>Country,</hi> and, if you will allow me freely to add it, your own <hi>Souls.</hi> Which of all these will not afford me an <hi>evident Demonstration</hi> of the <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>long-suffering</hi> of God? And speak him in the words of the <hi>Text,</hi> to be a God <hi>slow to Anger, and that repenteth him of the Evil?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That after so many <hi>Sins,</hi> as we have every one, the very best of us, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,</hi> we are yet alive this day; whereas God might, if he had pleased, long since have cut us off in the <hi>midst</hi> of our <hi>Sins</hi>: That after so many calls and invitations as he has sent to bring us to <hi>Repentance,</hi> he is still pleased to call and to invite us to it: That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding we have so far abused his <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>long-suffering,</hi> as to improve that which above all things should have the most engaged us to our Duty, into an encouragement to go on the rather in our <hi>Sins</hi>; he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless still continues to us the Offers of <hi>Pardon and Peace,</hi> if we will even now <hi>in this our day consider the things that make for our Peace</hi>: What is all this but a most Demonstrative, as well as a most Affectionate Proof, that God
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:59924:170"/>
is indeed <hi>slow to anger, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to Repentance?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he has deliver'd us out of so many dangers, in which, but for his <hi>Providence</hi> over us, we must long since have perish'd: That he has smitten us in <hi>Mercy,</hi> and not in Judgment; to correct and admonish, not to ruine and destroy us: That upon our depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating his Anger, he has at any time heard our Prayers, and answer'd our Desires: What is this but a plain Evidence, <hi>that he smites not willingly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lam. iii.33.</note> 
                  <hi>nor loves to afflict the Children of Men</hi>: and so is a God <hi>repenting him of the Evil</hi> that he is at any time forced either to <hi>threaten</hi> us with, or to <hi>bring upon us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if we look into his Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards us in the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of our Country, and our Religion; How <hi>slow</hi> must that God have been <hi>to Anger,</hi> who after so many years Attendance, nevertheless still calls upon us, as at <hi>this day,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. xviii 30.</note> 
                  <hi>to turn from our Evil way, and from the violence that is in our Hands, that our Iniquity may not be our ruine</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:59924:171"/>And for his <hi>repenting him of the Evil,</hi> which we have sometimes forced him by our continual Provocations to send upon us: Let the <hi>Instances</hi> which we our selves have known, suffice to tell us, how unwilling he has shewn himself to bring us to an utter deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>When it pleased God for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,<note place="margin">Lam. ii.6.</note> 
                  <hi>to despise, in his indignation, both the King and the Priest</hi>; and by the deplorable Judgment of <hi>Civil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions,</hi> had proved and exercised us about Twenty Years; with what a Miracle of Mercy did <hi>he turn again the Captivity of our Sion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. cxxvi.1.</note> and restore to us both our <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> as before?</p>
               <p>When this would not do, but our <hi>Sins</hi> and our <hi>Prosperity</hi> return'd together; so that we were again in a very few years become <hi>ripe for Judgment</hi>; He called forth a <hi>destroying Angel</hi>; He put a new Sword into his Hand, and commanded him to slay his <hi>Thousands, and Ten Thousands in our Streets.</hi> The PLAGUE consum'd our Strength; and hardly was that pass'd, when another Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, a <hi>devouring</hi> FIRE, such as scarce any Age or Country has ever
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:59924:171"/>
heard of, burnt down our Dwellings. And had not the Hand of God won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully interposed,<note place="margin">Isai. i.9.</note> 
                  <hi>we must have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet how did he then cover us with his Hand in that day of his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? He neither suffer'd our Enemies to invade us from abroad, nor any Domestick Quarrels to embroil us at home. He preserved us in Peace; he sent again the Blessings of Plenty and Prosperity among us, and our City is risen more Great and Glorious out of its Ashes.</p>
               <p>What shall I say to the <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>jealousies</hi> we have labour'd under since, from a restless Party, Enemies to the Name of <hi>Protestant,</hi> and by <hi>Principle</hi> conjured, if they can, to root it out of the World?</p>
               <p>In how many <hi>dangers</hi> has God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us? And how many Designs, for ought we know, may he have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, which have not yet been brought to light? And when at last, either to awaken us the more effectually to a <hi>Repentance</hi> of <hi>our Sins,</hi> or it may be to accomplish the number of their <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,</hi> he deliver'd us over for a little
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:59924:172"/>
while into the Hands of our Enemies; and to convince the most incredulous among us, what the true <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Popery</hi> is, suffer'd them with such an inconsiderate Fury to pursue our Ruine, That no Ties, either of God or Man, were sufficient to restrain them; but all Obligations, whether of <hi>Justice</hi> or <hi>Conscience,</hi> were equally trampled under their feet: How did it then please our <hi>Almighty Defender</hi> to assert his <hi>Character</hi> of being a God <hi>repenting him of the evil</hi> that he had brought upon us, in a manner that is the <hi>Wonder</hi> and <hi>Astonishment</hi> of the present; and, that I am perswaded, shall be the <hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Triumph</hi> of his <hi>Church</hi> in all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>Generations</hi>?</p>
               <p>He raised us up a <hi>Deliverer</hi> out of the <hi>House of his Servant David.</hi> He touch'd his <hi>Princely</hi> Heart with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sense both of the Evils which we had suffer'd, and of the greater that we apprehended. His <hi>Honour</hi> and his <hi>Zeal</hi> enflamed him to do somewhat worthy Himself; and that might answer the mighty Hopes God had prepared us to conceive of Him. He meditated the great Work of delivering our <hi>Country</hi> from <hi>Oppression,</hi> and our <hi>Religion</hi> from
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:59924:172"/>
                  <hi>Destruction.</hi> And by the Blessing of God, he accomplish'd it, in a manner so extraordinary in all its Circumstances, as, I think, should not suffer us to doubt from whose Providence it was, that this <hi>Redemption</hi> was sent to us. This <hi>was the Lord's doing, and,</hi> whatever it is, I am sure ought to be, <hi>marvellous in our Eyes</hi>: And may, I think, be a <hi>final,</hi> I hope it shall be an <hi>effectual</hi> Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to us of this Great Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our <hi>Text,</hi> to <hi>turn to him with all our hearts; viz.</hi> That he is a God <hi>repenting him of the evil</hi>; and therefore whose <hi>Mercy,</hi> if we now truly do so, we may securely depend upon both for the <hi>forgiveness</hi> of our <hi>sins,</hi> and for our <hi>deliverance</hi> from those <hi>dangers</hi> which our <hi>sins</hi> have so justly exposed us to.</p>
               <p>And now what remains, but that having all these great Encouragements, such <hi>Promises,</hi> or rather, such an <hi>Earnest</hi> of God's Favour to us, we resolve, every of one of us, seriously to comply with the great Design both of this <hi>Day,</hi> and of this <hi>Discourse</hi>; and by our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere <hi>Repentance</hi> for our past Offences, obtain that Blessing we so much desire both for our <hi>Country,</hi> and for our <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>

                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:59924:173"/>Never was there a <hi>time</hi> wherein we had greater Reason to hope for God's Acceptance than at this Day; and such an <hi>Occasion</hi> as this, to implore his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, there may not perhaps again occur in the Course of many Ages.</p>
               <p>For indeed, what is it that we are now assembled to recommend to His Mercy, but in Effect the preservation of our <hi>Selves,</hi> our <hi>Laws,</hi> our <hi>Liberties,</hi> and our <hi>Religion,</hi> against the Violence of those who have long conspired both <hi>Their</hi> and <hi>Our</hi> Destruction.</p>

               <p>And this he will do, if we be not our selves wanting to our own Preservation.

            <head>OF Contending Earnestly for the Faith Which was <hi>once</hi> delivered to The SAINTS. A SERMON Preached at MERCERS-CHAPEL, January 8. 1687/8.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>JUDE iii.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the <hi>Common Salvation,</hi> it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you, that you should <hi>earnestly contend</hi> for the <hi>Faith</hi> which was <hi>once deliver'd</hi> to the <hi>Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is generally agreed by Learned Men, that this <hi>Epistle</hi> was written by St. <hi>Jude</hi> upon the same Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and to the same Persons to whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> had not long before address'd his <hi>Second</hi>; whose Thoughts
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:59924:177"/>
he pursues, and whose very Words he seems in some places to have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. And the Subject and Design of both we have here express'd to us in the words of my <hi>Text; viz.</hi> to exhort the <hi>Christians</hi> dispersed abroad among the <hi>Jews,</hi> neither to sink under those <hi>Persecutions</hi> that were brought upon them for their <hi>Faith</hi>; nor to suffer that holy Doctrine which had been so fully and purely deliver'd to them by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> to be corrupted by the Errors of those pernicious <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> who even already began to creep in among them.</p>
            <p>Great was the danger of these <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> and great the concern of our <hi>Apostle</hi> for them. To persevere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly in the Faith, at a time when the severest Tryals were made use of to affright them from it; and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it in its Purity, when so many subtile <hi>Hereticks</hi> made it their whole business, by any means, to corrupt the Truth of it. And no wonder if St. <hi>Jude</hi> thought it not only becoming that <hi>Character</hi> our Blessed <hi>Lord</hi> had honour'd him with in his <hi>Church, to write unto them,</hi> but even <hi>necessary</hi> for him so to do; and to <hi>exhort them,</hi>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:59924:177"/>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to strive with all their might, and, as our <hi>Translation</hi> has very well rendred it, <hi>To contend earnestly for the Faith which was once deliver'd to the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the due prosecution of which words, as they lye before us in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,</hi> I shall consider these Four things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. What that <hi>Faith</hi> is, which the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> exhorted them to <hi>contend</hi> for?</item>
               <item>II. How they were to <hi>contend</hi> for it?</item>
               <item>III. The great reason they had at that time more especially so to do.</item>
               <item>IV. By what means he advised them to <hi>contend</hi> for it; that so they might secure their <hi>Faith</hi> in those <hi>dangerous times.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I. What that <hi>Faith</hi> is which the <hi>Apostle</hi> here exhorted them to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi> for?</p>
            <p>Now this the <hi>Character</hi> here given of it in our <hi>Text,</hi> will clearly shew. 'Tis the <hi>Faith which was</hi> once <hi>deliver'd to the Saints.</hi> That <hi>Faith</hi> which the Holy <hi>Apostles</hi> had <hi>once for all</hi> instructed them in, and which therefore both they and all succeeding <hi>Ages</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> were both faithfully to retain, and <hi>earnestly to contend for</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:59924:178"/>So that here then we have a plain account, what the true <hi>Christian Faith</hi> we are to profess, is, and where we are to seek it? 'Tis not the <hi>Faith</hi> of this or that <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Party</hi>; 'Tis not the <hi>Faith</hi> of this or that <hi>Country</hi> or <hi>Century.</hi> Let Men and Times make what Changes and Alterations they please in it: <hi>The Faith that was</hi> once <hi>delivered to the Saints,</hi> is what we are to <hi>contend for,</hi> not for any <hi>Inventions</hi> or <hi>Additions</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> that have since been brought into it.</p>
            <p>I shall not need to tell you whither you are to go for this <hi>Faith:</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> by providing us a <hi>rule</hi> of it; and <hi>assisting</hi> and <hi>directing</hi> those holy Men who first <hi>preach'd the Gospel</hi> to the <hi>Saints</hi> that then lived, to send it down in writing to all the other Disciples that were to follow after to the end of the World; has sufficiently directed us both whither we are to go for it, and indeed where it is that we can alone be sure to find it. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Interest has made some of late the better to <hi>defend</hi> their <hi>Errors,</hi> and to maintain an usurped <hi>Authority</hi> over Mens <hi>Consciences</hi> to pretend to some other <hi>Directions</hi>: Yet since it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:59924:178"/>
that the Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> were written for that very purpose, that they might be the <hi>Rule</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi>; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> has expresly told us,<note place="margin">2 Tim. iii.15.</note> 
               <hi>That they are able to make the Man of God wise unto Salvation, and throughly furnished to every good work</hi>; we shall have little reason to seek to any other <hi>Rule,</hi> till some good Account can be given why this is not sufficient; or by what <hi>Authority</hi> it is that they pretend to impose any other of their own invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us; and <hi>who gave them this Authority?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however, be the <hi>Rule</hi> of this <hi>Faith</hi> what it will, that is not my busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness at present to dispute. Let it only be resolved, that the <hi>Faith</hi> it self must be no other than what was <hi>once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Saints,</hi> and then I am sure it will be our duty not only readily to receive it, but <hi>earnestly to contend for</hi> it, be the means of its conveyance what they will.</p>
            <p>This is the next thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered by us;</p>
            <p>II. How we are to <hi>contend</hi> for this <hi>Faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:59924:179"/>And here if the Question be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>Contention,</hi> I have already observed, that the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Expression is very emphatical; and implies a great vigour and <hi>earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in the doing of it. To teach us with what zeal we ought to adhere to the <hi>Truth,</hi> and defend it against all such as would endeavour either to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright, or to seduce us from it.</p>
            <p>Indeed, whosoever shall consider the great value of that <hi>Faith which was once delivered to the Saints</hi>; and what our concern is in the preserving of it; will be forced to confess, that we can never be too <hi>earnest</hi> in our <hi>contending</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Truth</hi> is in all things so worthy and desirable, that a generous Spirit will think he can never prize it enough. We see the greatest Men have made it the whole business of their Lives to pursue it even in the smallest instances; and have thought their labours wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily rewarded, if with the greatest Application, and it may be with some danger and loss too, they have but been able to find it out at the last. Much more certainly ought that <hi>Truth,</hi> which the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> himself came down from Heaven to discover; and which,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:59924:179"/>
had he not revealed it to us, it would have been impossible for us ever to have come to the knowledge of it, to be most dear to us, and not upon any account to be forsaken by us.</p>
            <p>But when to this we shall add, That these <hi>Truths</hi> are not matters of meer <hi>Speculation,</hi> only to employ the Mind, and exercise the Soul in the Contemplation of them: That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern here is not a useless <hi>Theoreme</hi>; which whether we believe or not, we are neither at all the worse now, nor shall be ever the less happy hereafter; but such by our keeping or betraying whereof, we shall finally be Happy or Miserable for ever: That therefore to give up these <hi>Truths,</hi> is to become the vilest <hi>Traditors,</hi> the Betrayers not only of our <hi>Religion,</hi> but of our <hi>Souls</hi> too, and that to all <hi>Eternity</hi>; we cannot certainly but think it to be very much our concern to take the <hi>advice</hi> of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> and <hi>earnestly contend for the Faith that was</hi> once <hi>delivered to the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such is the necessity of this <hi>Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> And two things there were wherein St. <hi>Jude</hi> here exhorted them to the Practice of it, proportionable to the two great dangers to which I have before
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:59924:180"/>
said these <hi>Christians</hi> were then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>First</hi>; The <hi>Christians</hi> to whom he wrote, were at this time actually under a <hi>Persecution</hi> for their <hi>Faith,</hi> and by consequence under great Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to <hi>Apostatize</hi> from it. And this danger was by so much the more to be apprehended, for that a sort of <hi>Hereticks</hi> were crept in among them, who the better to preserve themselves from those Evils which <hi>Christianity</hi> then brought upon all the faithful Professors of it, had among their other <hi>Errors,</hi> set up this for one, That it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in such Tryals to dissemble their <hi>Faith,</hi> and to escape <hi>Persecution</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>Now in Opposition to this base Cowardise of these Men, we must first interpret the <hi>Contention</hi> here spoken of to imply a firmness and resolution of Mind to undergo any Evils, rather than to <hi>deny their Religion</hi>: That they should not, like those vile <hi>Hereticks,</hi> seek by unworthy Compliances to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve themselves from danger, and ruine their Souls in the <hi>other</hi> World, to save their Lives, and to preserve the little Interests of this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:59924:180"/>And the same should be the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of every good Christian now. <hi>Persecution</hi> ought to be so far from affrighting him from his <hi>Faith,</hi> that he ought then most firmly to adhere to it, when he sees others the most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in opposing it. What tho' he should be called to suffer for it? <hi>Death</hi> ought never to amaze that Man, who is able to look forward into <hi>Heaven</hi> beyond it; and there see that <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Glory</hi> which these <hi>light afflictions that are but for a moment</hi> shall place upon his Head for all <hi>Eternity.</hi> A true <hi>Christian</hi> is never greater, than when he is under the <hi>Cross</hi>: Nor can any thing be more glorious to the Faithful Disciple, than to follow his dear <hi>Master,</hi> not only in Well-doing, but, <hi>if the Will of God be so,</hi> in <hi>patient Suffering</hi> too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. viii.35,</note> 
               <hi>or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? (As it is written,</hi>
               <note place="margin">— 36,</note> 
               <hi>For thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter:) Nay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">— 37.</note> 
               <hi>in all these things we are more than Conquerors, through him that loved us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:59924:181"/>But, <hi>Secondly</hi>; This was not the only danger they were then likely to run, nor it may be the greatest. And the hazard of corrupting their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by the Artifices of those <hi>Hereticks</hi> who were unawares crept in among them, was yet more to be apprehended than their total <hi>Apostatizing</hi> from it. And therefore St. <hi>Jude</hi> here exhorts them, <hi>to contend earnestly for the Faith that was once delivered to the Saints</hi>; i. e. to be very wary and circumspect to maintain it in that purity in which they had received it, and not suffer any little Sophistry or Insinuations of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to lead them into any Errors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the truth of it.</p>
            <p>And indeed, whosoever shall look into the <hi>Annals</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> will find this to have ever been the more fatal danger of the two: And that the Devil has in all Ages gain'd more by the secret cunning of his <hi>false Teachers,</hi> than by the open violence of his <hi>Persecutors.</hi> There's many a <hi>Christian</hi> who has carriage enough to Die for his <hi>Faith,</hi> that yet has not Skill enough to <hi>defend</hi> it. And those whose business it is to deceive, never fail to
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:59924:181"/>
set most upon such as they think are the least able to do so. And therefore it cannot certainly but be very advisable in us all, and especially for those who are the most ignorant, to be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of themselves as to this matter: Not to hearken to every little Pretender that will but undertake to lead them; but if any such offers himself to them, to draw them away from the right Faith, either absolutely to reject him, or rather to bring him forth unto the light; to refer him to their <hi>Teachers,</hi> who instruct them in the <hi>Truth,</hi> and who are therefore the fittest to defend the Interests of it. And so maintain that wise indifference which ought to be the resolution of every good Man in the search of all, but especially of <hi>divine Truth</hi>; neither obstinately to refuse a better Instruction whenever it shall indeed be offered to him, much less to be cheated out of his Religion by Noise and Confidence, by high Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and no Arguments; and so by his easiness, betray that Faith which our <hi>Apostle</hi> here calls us so <hi>earnestly to contend for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:59924:182"/>And this is a <hi>Caution</hi> that cannot be unseasonable at any time. But yet some times there are wherein 'tis more especially to be recommended to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. And such was that wherein St. <hi>Jude</hi> wrote this <hi>Epistle</hi>: Which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brings me to my next Point,</p>
            <p>III. Of the reason which the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> at that time had more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thus to <hi>contend for the Faith which was</hi> once <hi>delivered to the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not now say any thing of that general Obligation which lyes upon all <hi>Christians</hi> thus <hi>to contend for the Faith, viz.</hi> the <hi>Eternal Salvation</hi> of their <hi>Souls,</hi> according as they are careful or not in so doing, though this ought certainly to have always its weight too with us, both because I have already said somewhat to this before, and because I am now only to consider the particular Reasons which those to whom St. <hi>Jude</hi> here wrote, had at that time so to do. And those, whethersoever of the two things we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, which I have before shewn they were herein exhorted to, are such as
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:59924:182"/>
ought very much to have engaged their care in this <hi>Contention.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> As to the <hi>renouncing</hi> of their <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were <hi>actually</hi> under a Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for it. Their Interests, their Ease, their Inclinations, all sollicited them so to do. And as if all this were not enough, some who called themselves <hi>Christians</hi> among them, not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them by their <hi>Example,</hi> but even maintain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d it as an <hi>Opinion,</hi> That to avoid Persecution, they might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and warrantably dissemble their Belief. And sure then it was high time for the <hi>Apostle</hi> to interpose his <hi>Exhortation,</hi> to stir them up to <hi>contend</hi> for that <hi>Faith</hi> which both their <hi>Enemies persecuted,</hi> and their <hi>pretended Catholick Brethren</hi> so readily renounced. To press them with such Arguments, as both their present Circumstances, and past Prophecies offer'd to him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in it; and which ought to have been of much greater weight with them to keep them in the right way, than the scandalous <hi>Examples</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of their Adversaries to draw them
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59924:183"/>
out of it. Now two <hi>Considerations</hi> there were, which some suppose the <hi>Apostle</hi> to have here offer'd to them for this purpose.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The nearness of their <hi>Deliverance</hi>; which according to our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi> must now be, as indeed it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards proved, very nigh at hand.</p>
            <p>This is what the learned Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> understood to have been signified by that Phrase of the <hi>Text</hi>; where the <hi>Apostle</hi> says, he thought it necessary to write unto them, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Of the common Salvation</hi>; i. e. (says <note n="*" place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Par. upon this Verse, and Note on Rom. xiii.c.</note> he) of that <hi>special Promise of Christ to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and deliver those who should firmly adhere to him,</hi> from that <hi>Vniversal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi> which was in a little time to <hi>befall the Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many were the Denuntiations of our Blessed <hi>Lord</hi> against the <hi>Jews</hi> in his <hi>Gospel.</hi> The Calamities he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told were great, and the time of their accomplishment nigh at hand. <hi>That Generation,</hi> which then lived, <hi>was not to pass away till all should be fulfilled.</hi> But for those among them who should embrace and keep firm to his Religion,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:59924:183"/>
they were to be secured in the midst of this Desolation. So <hi>Mat.</hi> x.22. where speaking of those very Persecutions which St. <hi>Jude</hi> here refers to, he tells them, <hi>But he that endures to the end,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Hammond, Mat.</hi> x. <hi>h. Rom.</hi> xiii. <hi>c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>shall be saved. Shall be saved,</hi> not only in another World, though that be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain too; but by a remarkable delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance even in this. And accordingly St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who wrote much about the same time that St. <hi>Jude</hi> did, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the very same things, exemplifies this Deliverance in that remarkable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family, when the whole World besides perished in the Deluge, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii.5. Of righteous <hi>Lot</hi> and his Children, who were brought by an <hi>Angel</hi> out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> when the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Sodomites</hi> were destroyed, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. And then makes this remarkable Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>The Lord,</hi> says he, <hi>knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if this be allowed of as the true meaning of this <hi>Phrase,</hi> then certainly it could not but be a great engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them to continue constant in their Profession: To consider, that they had but a little while remaining, and their Deliverance should be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd:
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:59924:184"/>
That,<note place="margin">Rom. xiii.11.</note> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> phrases it, <hi>their Salvation was now nearer than when they believed.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. xiii.12.</note> 
               <hi>The night was far spent, the day was at hand</hi>: And therefore how unworthy, indeed how weak a thing would it be for them, after all they had hitherto suffered for the <hi>Faith,</hi> now finally to <hi>apostatize</hi> from it, when they were just ready to be delivered out of all their Dangers.</p>
            <p>But this is not all the force of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, St. <hi>Jude</hi> presses it yet farther; for that,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such an <hi>Apostasie</hi> would not only not secure them, but would most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly involve them in that very Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which they sought to escape by it.</p>
            <p>And of this the <hi>Examples</hi> which our <hi>Apostle</hi> subjoins, are an evident Proof; and that Destruction which accordingly did involve the Complying <hi>Hereticks</hi> with the Unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> became a terrible Application. Our Blessed <hi>Lord,</hi> who provided for the Security of the Constant <hi>Christians,</hi> leaving the rest, as he had declared he would, <hi>to lose their Souls,</hi> or Lives, that were so politick for the <hi>saving</hi> or preserving of them;
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:59924:184"/>
and to be a standing Caution to all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages, how unworthy, indeed how dangerous a thing it is for Men to purchase their Lives at the price of their <hi>Consciences</hi>; and to betray their <hi>Souls</hi> to Eternl Damnation in <hi>another</hi> World, to secure the little Interests and Advantages of <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such reason therefore had these <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> upon all these Accounts, <hi>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend earnestly for the Faith</hi>; i. e. not to renounce it, but to continue firm and constant in the Profession of it. Nor were their Engagement, <hi>Secondly,</hi> any less,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To <hi>contend for it</hi>; as it implies a Zeal for the preserving the Primitive Purity of it.</p>
            <p>And indeed 'tis this seems to have been the more especial design of St. <hi>Jude</hi> in this <hi>Caution.</hi> For having in our <hi>Text</hi> exhorted them <hi>earnestly to contend for the Faith which was once delivered to the Saints</hi>; he immediately subjoyns this Reason, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>That there were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain men crept in among them, ungodly men, who turn'd the grace of God into lasciviousness,</hi> and would otherwise be likely enough to pervert them from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:59924:185"/>Now this could not but be a very great Obligation upon them to look to themselves, and stand fast in the Truth which they had received, to be thus expresly forewarn'd of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and admonish'd by the <hi>Apostle</hi> what Men there were crept in among them, that would make it their whole endeavour to corrupt their Purity. But especially if we consider the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter which the Holy <hi>Apostles</hi> every where given of them; and which will yet more evidently shew how likely they would be, without very great care, to deceive them. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> As our <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. They were great <hi>Pretenders</hi>; they spoke mighty things in their own Commendation, as if they alone had not only all Truth, but all Knowledge too on their sides; and the rest of Mankind were but as Beasts in comparison of them. Now this often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time makes a huge impression upon weak Minds, who do not sufficiently consider how suspitious a thing it is for Men to be too forward in their own Commendation; and that the best and wisest Men are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:59924:185"/>
those, who make the least noise of their Goodness, and their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> They were very subtile and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in propagating their <hi>Heresie.</hi> They durst not attack those whom they knew to be very firm, or well instructed in the Faith. But they crept slily and secretly into Mens Houses, and, as the <hi>Devil</hi> their Master before them, they set commonly upon the weaker Sex;<note place="margin">2 Tim. iii.6.</note> 
               <hi>leading captive silly Women,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>those too,</hi> for the most part, <hi>laden with divers lusts.</hi> Such for whom <hi>Christianity</hi> was too severe and rigid an Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they could not find any great hopes of living up to, or consequently of being saved by the Rules of that; and they were therefore glad to hear of some more easie, and more agreeable way to Happiness.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> And such, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> these <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> fail'd not to propose to them. Their <hi>Religion</hi> consisted chiefly in a sett of incomprehensible <hi>Phrases</hi> and <hi>Notions</hi>; and if they were but Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of <hi>Simon</hi> and his <hi>Helena,</hi> it was
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:59924:186"/>
for the rest no great matter how little <hi>Morality</hi> they observed. If it were dangerous to profess <hi>Christianity,</hi> they might freely deny it; and <hi>judaïze,</hi> rather than suffer Persecution. If their Lusts disturb'd them, it was natural, and therefore lawful to gratifie them: and it was a great mistake to think that they ought not to do so. The truth is, I am ashamed to repeat in this place, what <hi>Ecclesiastical Writers</hi> have delivered down to us concerning them: And I shall content my self to refer you only to this short <hi>Epistle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 4, 8, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, 16, 18, 19.</note> for the <hi>Character</hi> both of them and their <hi>Religion.</hi> For I am much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken if this alone will not suffice to shew what just cause our <hi>Apostle</hi> had to fear their prevailing: and that such an easie Practice, supported by such high Pretences, might be but too apt to gain over <hi>Proselytes</hi> to its Party.</p>
            <p>Let us see therefore in the last place,</p>
            <p>4<hi>thly,</hi> By what means it was that St. <hi>Jude</hi> here exhorted the yet <hi>Orthodox Christians</hi> to contend for their Faith, and secure themselves in those dangerous Times.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:59924:186"/>And those are principally these five:
<list>
                  <item>1. By a close <hi>Adherence</hi> to that <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> which had been delivered to them.</item>
                  <item>2. By taking heed of those that would seduce them from it.</item>
                  <item>3. By <hi>building themselves on their holy Faith</hi>; i. e. by adding Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of Life to the Purity of their Faith.</item>
                  <item>4. By fervent <hi>Prayer</hi> to God for his Assistance. And,</item>
                  <item>5. By a serious consideration of their future state.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>These are the <hi>means</hi> which St. <hi>Jude</hi> here exhorts them to make use of to secure their Faith; and they are indeed such as if duly observed, will not fail to have a prosperous <hi>Effect</hi> to the end for which they are proposed.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> The <hi>First</hi> way <hi>to contend earnestly for the Faith,</hi> is, To keep close to that <hi>holy Doctrine</hi> which we have received.</p>
            <p>This was what the <hi>Apostle</hi> in our <hi>Text</hi> advised them to do; or rather, not barely to keep close to it, but, as
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:59924:187"/>
the Phrase here is, <hi>to contend earnestly for it.</hi> And that was then a most undoubted Security, when the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves taught them their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and so their <hi>Faith</hi> came to them without all dispute, <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>uncorrupted.</hi> And however we do not now pretend that Men should give up themselves so intirely to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, as to stop their Ears to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can be said against us: yet since we profess no other <hi>Faith</hi> than that which <hi>was once delivered unto the Saints</hi>; since the <hi>Rule</hi> by which we go, cannot be denied to contain that <hi>Faith,</hi> and we desire not to be believed by you, any farther than what we teach is found to be agreeable to that <hi>Rule:</hi> I think we may very reasonably thus far at least make the Application even now, That you ought not lightly to forsake a <hi>Faith</hi> which is built upon such a <hi>Foundation,</hi> I am sure not for such a one as is built upon any other. And though we are so far from encouraging a blind Obstinacy in any one, that, on the contrary, we had rather all Men would search and see, whether what we profess, be not indeed that <hi>Faith which was once delivered to the Saints:</hi>
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:59924:187"/>
yet this deference we think every one ought to pay to that <hi>Church</hi> which first made him <hi>Christian,</hi> and to those <hi>Guides</hi> whom God's Providence has set over him to build him up in the <hi>Faith</hi>; as not lightly to forsake either them or their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but to presume for the <hi>Truth</hi> of what they already profess, till they can be very clearly and evidently convinced of the contrary. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> The next <hi>means</hi> proposed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were <hi>to contend for the Faith,</hi> was, By <hi>taking heed</hi> of those who would have <hi>seduced</hi> them from it.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>general</hi> design of this whole <hi>Epistle,</hi> and I have before shewn what great need there was of such a Caution. Now by <hi>taking heed</hi> of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers,</hi> I do not mean to imply, that Men should be so obstinately wary, as not to hearken to any thing that one of a contrary Persuasion is able to say either for his own Opinions, or against ours: For that were to lead Men by <hi>Faction,</hi> not <hi>Reason.</hi> But I mean these Two things: First, That we should not have our Ears so open, as to hearken to every thing that any one shall think fit
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:59924:188"/>
to offer to disquiet our Minds, and disturb our Consciences, without any just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion for it: Nay, it may be, upon the account of such things, wherein we are certainly and evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that we are in the right. Much less, that we should seek occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Disputes,</hi> and love to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually raising Difficulties against our <hi>Religion,</hi> lest we should at last pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to give us over to Delusion, and punish our needless exposing our selves to <hi>Temptation,</hi> by suffering us to be overcome by it. Nor, Secondly, So far comply with such Persons, as to give our selves up to their <hi>Seduction,</hi> and become easie and willing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them.</p>
            <p>It is certainly a great weakness in any Man to go to his <hi>Enemy</hi> for the <hi>Character</hi> of his <hi>Religion.</hi> To enquire concerning the <hi>Truth,</hi> of those who are the profess'd Opposers of it. If Men have <hi>Doubts,</hi> or if their <hi>Curiosity</hi> must be gratified in starting of needless <hi>Scruples,</hi> and one part only be consulted, both Charity and Duty, and I had almost said even common Civility too, might satisfie them, that they ought to be their
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:59924:188"/>
Instructors, whom God has set over them to be their <hi>Guides</hi> in Holy things, rather than any others.</p>
            <p>But if this be thought too great a <hi>Partiality,</hi> to hear one side only, and not enquire at all of the other; yet, at least if our <hi>Enemies</hi> may be admitted, our own <hi>Guides</hi> sure ought not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, but to be allowed at least to be as worthy our regard, as their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries. Nor can I think any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, than that he is minded to be <hi>seduced,</hi> who instead of taking heed of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> seeks only to them; instead of avoiding them, avoids those from whom, if not alone, yet I am sure prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, he ought to fortifie himself against them.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> The next <hi>means</hi> proposed for their <hi>contending for the Faith,</hi> was, By Innocence and Holiness of Life.</p>
            <p>This St. <hi>Jude</hi> calls, a <hi>Building up our selves upon our most holy Faith,</hi> ver. 20. And again, a <hi>keeping of our selves in the love of God,</hi> ver. 21. And an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>means</hi> no doubt it is, to preserve the Purity of our <hi>Faith,</hi> and to keep
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:59924:189"/>
our selves from being seduced from it.</p>
            <p>I shall not need to tell you how powerful a <hi>motive</hi> the want of <hi>Piety</hi> has been to most of those Errors that have infested the <hi>Church</hi> Whilst Men, to gratifie their Passions, have corrupted their <hi>Faith</hi>; and Pride and Discontent, Interest and Ambition, Looseness and Indulgence, more than want of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, have made Men <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And were we now to enquire, what the true cause is that keeps up these <hi>Divisions</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> at this day; why Men should be so obstinate in <hi>Errors</hi> so plainly contrary to the very <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and, I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most said, to the common <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> of Mankind, that it even poses our <hi>Charity</hi> to think they do not themselves know them to be so: I fear the best Account we should be able to give of this matter, would be, That <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Prejudice</hi> blind their Eyes; and that their Errors are as Useful and Beneficial, as they are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Gross and Unreasonable.</p>
            <p>But would Men indeed lay aside all Humane Considerations, as in things wherein <hi>Eternity</hi> is at stake, they ought
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:59924:189"/>
to do: Would they with <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> seek the <hi>Truth,</hi> and be as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to discover their own, as they are but too forward to censure other Mens faults: In plain terms, would they be <hi>Christians</hi> indeed, seek nothing but the Glory of God, the Peace and Unity of his Church, and the Salvation of their own Souls; I cannot but think that most of our <hi>Controversies</hi> would presently vanish, and we should yet recover that <hi>Truth</hi> which, I fear, some Men have too long detain'd in Unrighteousness, and been deprived of by their own fault.</p>
            <p>But especially would they to this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty and Integrity, add,</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi>'s next Direction, Of fervent <hi>Prayer</hi> to God for his Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
            <p>For certainly the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> is so great a Good, and so pleasing and acceptable to <hi>God Almighty</hi> to be implored of him, that a pious and upright Man, earnestly praying, and heartily seeking after it, shall hardly be deny'd the Happiness of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to the <hi>Faith,</hi> if he be already
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:59924:190"/>
in the right way; or of being brought to it, if he is not.</p>
            <p>He who has promised the true <hi>Votary,</hi> not to refuse him in any thing that is necessary or but expedient for him, if he asks as he ought to do; will never fail to answer him in a matter of such moment. And if he does not neglect himself while he <hi>prays</hi> to God, but uses such Care and Caution as St. <hi>Jude</hi> here directs us to do for our Security, he need not be afraid, though he were encompassed with <hi>Seducers</hi> on every side; but be confident, that he shall either still go on in the right way, or obtain God's Pardon, if after all this he should chance to be mistaken in it.</p>
            <p>There is yet one <hi>means</hi> more whereby St. <hi>Jude</hi> exhorts the <hi>Christians, earnestly to contend for their Faith.</hi> And that is,</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> By a serious Consideration of their <hi>future state.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Keep your selves</hi> (says he) <hi>in the love of God, looking for the Mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, unto Eternal Life,</hi> ver. 21. And indeed it cannot be doubted but that this great Consideration, which so
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:59924:190"/>
highly influences all the other parts of a Christian Life, must here also prove of a singular advantage to keep us firm and stedfast in our <hi>Faith.</hi> This will make us diligent in all the rest; will awaken our Care, will perfect our Piety, and enflame our Devotion. By this we shall be secure, that no worldly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations shall be able to prevail upon us, to forsake our Religion. We shall neither be moved for any Terrors to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it, nor be cajolled by any Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests or Persuasions to give it up. But we shall resolve, as we ought, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire diligently into the Grounds of our Profession, to judge impartially, and stedfastly follow what we are persuaded to be the right Faith; that so we may be able to give a comfortable Account of our selves to God, when we shall appear at his Tribunal. No matter how severely we may be censured by Men for our so doing. We know that <hi>Truth</hi> very often meets with, and makes Enemies to the best Men. Christianity it self was once every where spoken against, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> arraign'd as a <hi>Heretick.</hi> But whilst with that <hi>Apostle</hi> we know wherefore we believe, we shall be so far from
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:59924:191"/>
being afraid of their Censures, or ashamed of our Profession, that should we for the sake of Christ, as he was, be brought even before the <hi>Tribunals</hi> of our Enemies, we shall be able with assurance to answer for our selves as he did; <hi>That after the way which they call</hi> Heresie,<note place="margin">Act. xxiv.14.</note> 
               <hi>so worship we the God of our Fathers, believing all things that are written in the Law and the Prophets.</hi> Such a power will this great Consideration of <hi>Eternal Life</hi> have over us, to secure us in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that it will actuate all the other <hi>means</hi> that have before been offer'd to establish our Faith, and it self become a new defence, and such as all the <hi>Sophistry</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> of our Enemies shall not be able ever to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
            <p>And thus have I given you as full an Account as the time would permit of the several things I proposed to consider: And however I have not so closely confined my Reflections to the particular concern of those <hi>Christians</hi> to whom St. <hi>Jude</hi> wrote, as not to have observed somewhat in general the use that all others ought to make of this Caution; yet I will now in the <hi>close</hi>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:59924:191"/>
crave leave to offer two or three <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections</hi> more, which may serve to shew our own more immediate concern in it.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>First</hi>; Let us from hence learn with what <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Constancy</hi> we ought to <hi>contend for our Religion</hi>; which I will be bold to say, does, if any in the whole World, the best deserve the <hi>Character</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi> of being <hi>the Faith that was once delivered to the Saints,</hi> and that without mixture of any thing corruptive of, or contrary thereunto.</p>
            <p>We pretend not to impose any thing either upon your <hi>Belief</hi> or <hi>Practice,</hi> but what the <hi>Rule</hi> of this <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> themselves prescribe, or at least <hi>allow</hi> us to do. We give no other <hi>Interpretation</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> than what is either so apparently the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, that no impartial Person can doubt of it; or else has been so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally received by the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>purest An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,</hi> and is otherwise so agreeable with the rest of our <hi>Faith,</hi> that there can be no just cause to suspect it. The <hi>Articles</hi> of our <hi>Creed,</hi> are the same now, which the <hi>Church</hi> has received and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd from the beginning; and so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:59924:192"/>
founded on the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>God's Word,</hi> that they neither can nor do admit of any <hi>Dispute</hi> among <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi> Those who the most pretend us to be <hi>defective</hi> in our <hi>Faith,</hi> yet dare not say we are <hi>erroneous</hi> in what we do <hi>profess</hi>: They acknowledge that what we <hi>believe</hi> is right, only they think we do not <hi>believe</hi> all that we ought, because not all that they would have us, to do.</p>
            <p>And certainly then such a <hi>Faith</hi> as this cannot but deserve to be <hi>earnestly contended for,</hi> as being without all Controversie, truly that <hi>Faith which was once delivered to the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that so much the rather, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> At this time, when so many <hi>Seducers,</hi> for I shall spare the rest of St. <hi>Jude</hi>'s Character, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. are crept in among us; and make it their great Endeavour, by any means, to draw us away from it. I shall not repeat either the manner how I have shewn we ought to <hi>contend for our Faith</hi> against them, or the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which from the <hi>Apostle</hi> I have before offered for the doing of it. Let us only resolve on that one
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:59924:192"/>
most just and reasonable <hi>Method,</hi> never to leave our own <hi>Faith,</hi> till we can be clearly and evidently convinced, that we have a better offer'd to us in the stead of it; and then we shall either free our selves altogether from the Attacks of our <hi>Adversaries,</hi> who seldom care to meddle with honest and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men; or I am sure we shall not run any great Hazzard by their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</p>
            <p>But above all, <hi>Thirdly</hi>; Whilst we thus <hi>contend for the Faith that was once delivered to the Saints,</hi> let us be Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of their <hi>Lives,</hi> as well as of their <hi>Doctrine.</hi> This is that which must save us, when all our Disputes will otherwise stand us in no stead. To <hi>believe</hi> aright, will do us but small service, if we do not <hi>live</hi> so too. And I am persuaded, would we but be prevailed with to do this as we ought, it would not only most effectually se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us in the Truth, but be the most likely means in the World to draw over others to it.</p>
            <p>And indeed what pity is it, that a <hi>Chureh,</hi> which has in all other respects
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:59924:193"/>
so many admirable Advantages above its <hi>Adversaries,</hi> that it is defective in no other <hi>mark</hi> of being truly <hi>Primitive,</hi> and even in this is less defective than others, should not be blessed with this too? Consider, I beseech you, that we rely upon none of those <hi>broken Reeds</hi> which others lay so much stress upon, to make you <hi>happy</hi> in <hi>another Life,</hi> though you are not <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> in <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there be then any concern for your <hi>own</hi> or your <hi>Church</hi>'s <hi>honour</hi>; if any <hi>value</hi> for your <hi>Immortal Souls</hi>; if you <hi>desire</hi> the Blessing of <hi>God</hi> now, and the benefit of his <hi>Promises</hi> in the World to come; if these <hi>Motives,</hi> which one would think should be of all others the most considerable, may be allowed to have any influence at all upon you; think then upon these things, and fulfil ye our Joy in the <hi>practice</hi> of that <hi>Piety</hi> whereunto ye are called. Be as Good, as ye are Orthodox; as free from all Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in your Manners, as God be thanked you are from Error in your Belief: Accomplish that great Work, which Heaven seems at last to have begun among us; And as we are now appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:59924:193"/>
more concern'd for our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, than we have perhaps any of us heretofore been; so let us go on in well-doing more and more. Let us <hi>grow in Grace,</hi> and then we shall also <hi>grow in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. iii.18. Eph. iv.13.</note> 
               <hi>till finally we all come in the Vnity of the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect Man, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.</hi>

            <p>THese Words are part of that Solemn <hi>Form</hi> in which our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> first cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> of his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi>; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

as a sacred <hi>Institution,</hi> to be continued for ever in his <hi>Church,</hi> in remembrance of that <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> which he was just then about to undergo for it.</p>
            <p>Whether our <hi>Apostle</hi> recounted the History of this great <hi>Institution,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what some of those who were present at the first Celebration of it, had delivered it unto him; or whether, as seems most probable, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the manner of it by some <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Revelation</hi> from our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> himself: This is plain,<note rend="inter">
                  <hi>Non est meum quod vobis tradidi, sed à Domino illud accepi: sicut ipse alibi dicit, Non ab hominibus sed à Deo omnia didicisse.</hi> Hieron. in ver. 23. — See Gal. i.1, 12.</note> that what he here reports to them of this matter, was no idle Story, no vain Account of his own Invention, but a true and exact Relation of what the Blessed <hi>Jesus</hi> then did, when <hi>in the same night in which he was betray'd, he took</hi> Bread, <hi>and when he had given thanks, brake it, and gave it to his Disciples, saying, Take, Eat, this is my Body which is broken for you,</hi>
               <q>This do in Remembrance of Me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So that our <hi>Text</hi> then you see contains a positive <hi>Command</hi> of our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> himself, of something which he
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:59924:195"/>
ordered his <hi>Apostles</hi> to do with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to this <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi>: And my business at this time shall be to consider what that was, and how far we at this day are to look upon our selves to be concerned in it. I shall reduce what I have to offer upon this occasion, to these two general Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations:</p>
            <p>I. Of the <hi>false Construction</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> which those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> make of these words.</p>
            <p>Which having done, so far as may be necessary to the following Discourse, I will then,</p>
            <p>II. Shew what indeed it was that our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> here commanded his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and in <hi>them, All</hi> of <hi>us</hi> to <hi>Do, in Remembrance of Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by that time I have clearly examin'd these Two <hi>Points,</hi> I presume I shall in some measure have laid open the whole <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> of this <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi>; and in that have answer'd the <hi>End</hi> of these <hi>Solemn</hi> and <hi>Extraordinary Assemblies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:59924:196"/>And first I am to consider,</p>
            <p>I. That <hi>false Construction</hi> and <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> which those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> make of these words.</p>
            <p>It is the Opinion of those of the other <hi>Communion,</hi> That our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> here spoke to his <hi>Apostles,</hi> not as the <hi>Representatives</hi> of the <hi>whole Body</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>

            <p>The truth is, both the Opinion of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s making his <hi>Apostles Priests</hi> by these words, and the <hi>Paraphrase</hi> which they now give of them in order thereunto, are a meer <hi>Invention</hi> of these <hi>later Ages,</hi> sought out to support that other great <hi>Corruption</hi> of this <hi>Holy Institution,</hi> the <hi>Communicating</hi> of the <hi>Laity</hi> only in <hi>One Kind.</hi> When being pressed both with the <hi>Example</hi> of our <hi>Blessed Lord</hi> in his Institution of this <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> who gave the <hi>Cup</hi> as well as <hi>Bread</hi> to his Disciples; and with his <hi>positive Command,</hi> to <hi>do</hi> that to <hi>Others</hi> which <hi>Himself</hi> had done to <hi>Them.</hi> The nice <hi>Masters</hi> of the <hi>Schools,</hi> Men who never wanted a subtilty to elude what they could not otherwise fairly answer, first found out this admirable <hi>Secret,</hi> unknown to the <hi>Church</hi> for above a <hi>Thousand</hi> Years before; <hi>viz.</hi> That our Saviour here <hi>Consecrating</hi> the <hi>Holy Eucharist,</hi> and giving a <hi>Command</hi> to his
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:59924:199"/>
               <hi>Apostles</hi> to <hi>Do likewise,</hi> did invest them thereby in their <hi>Priestly Office,</hi> and so intitule them to a Right of <hi>Receiving</hi> the <hi>Cup</hi> from him, which neither they therefore had any Right to <hi>before,</hi> nor have the People by consequence any more Right to at this very <hi>day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however, such an Evasion as this might well enough become the <hi>School-Errantry,</hi> and serve to amuze a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Age wherein it was first invented; yet was it certainly too great a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> in such inquisitive Times as these, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it upon Mens Consciences as an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>; and to think, by the vain Terror of an ungrounded <hi>Anathema,</hi> to secure it against all Opposition. For not to insist,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> On the many <hi>gross Absurdities,</hi> and even <hi>blasphemous Consequences</hi> of the very Doctrine of the <hi>Mass</hi> it self, That there should be a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>proper Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> and yet nothing <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly sacrificed</hi>: A <hi>Propitiatory Offering,</hi> and yet no <hi>Propitiation</hi> made by it: That <hi>Christ</hi> was but <hi>once offered</hi> for our <hi>Sins,</hi> and yet that he should be <hi>offered</hi> again <hi>ten thousand times every day:</hi>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:59924:200"/>
That by that <hi>One offering of Himself, he should have perfected for Ever them that are sanctified</hi>; and yet that those that are <hi>sanctified</hi> should not be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected</hi> without many of these <hi>New-Mass-Offerings</hi> made for them. To say nothing,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of the inconsistency there is in the very Supposition, That our Saviour Christ should <hi>ordain Priests</hi> of the <hi>New-Covenant</hi> in his <hi>Church,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had yet so much as <hi>sealed</hi> that <hi>Covenant</hi> by his Death, or establish'd his <hi>Church.</hi> To pass by,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That we have another plain and evident Account, both when, and after what manner, and with what words our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> did ordain his <hi>Apostles</hi> to the <hi>Ministry</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> namely, in the <hi>Twentieth Chapter</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi>; where we are told how, <hi>after his Resurrection,</hi> he thus gave them their Mission, <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22, 23. <hi>Peace be unto you; as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you:</hi> And then he <hi>breathed upon them,</hi> and said, <hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghost; whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained:</hi>

            <p>I say, not to <hi>insist</hi> on any of these things, either we must look upon these words to relate to the whole <hi>Church,</hi> to the <hi>People</hi> as well as to the <hi>Priests</hi>; and then to be sure they cannot have either the <hi>Effect</hi> or <hi>Signification</hi> that they herein attribute unto them; or else it will remain, that there is no <hi>Divine Command</hi> at all entituling the <hi>People</hi> to any Right to this <hi>Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
               <pb n="384" facs="tcp:59924:201"/>
For if our Saviour spoke to his <hi>Apostles</hi> as <hi>Priests,</hi> if he not only took the <hi>Bread</hi> and the <hi>Cup</hi> and <hi>consecrated</hi> them as a <hi>Priest</hi> himself, but also <hi>distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted</hi> them to the <hi>Apostles</hi> as <hi>Priests,</hi> and bad them, <hi>Take, Eat</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> as <hi>Priests</hi>; then are not the <hi>People,</hi> no not by Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, at all concerned in any part of this <hi>Institution,</hi> which the <hi>Priests</hi> only, by virtue of this <hi>Command,</hi> are obliged to continue, and <hi>consecrate, offer, give, receive,</hi> all by themselves, and to one another, as <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> here are supposed, without the rest of the <hi>Disciples,</hi> and as <hi>Priests,</hi> to have done.</p>
            <p>To pass by therefore this <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> both so lately invented, and so weakly established; set up to support that bold attempt of <hi>depriving the People of one half of the Communion,</hi> and that upon such <hi>Principles</hi> as in the natural consequence of them rob them of <hi>both</hi>; I go on to the other Point I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and shall now take leave some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more largely to insist upon; <hi>Viz.</hi>

               <pb n="385" facs="tcp:59924:201"/>II. To shew, what indeed it was that our <hi>Saviour</hi> here commanded his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and in them all of us, to <hi>do in Remembrance of Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to this end it will be necessary that we distinctly to consider these Two things:
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>First,</hi> What we are to understand by the Phrase, <hi>Do this?</hi>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> What it is to <hi>Do this in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Christ?</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I answer; That if we take these words as they lye before us in the first and most obvious Form of a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> they will then imply a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission hereby given to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and in them to the <hi>whole Church,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue this <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> by an <hi>Ordinance</hi> for ever, as a Solemn Memorial of that <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> which he was now about to undergo for us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="386" facs="tcp:59924:202"/>When God was pleased, by a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Deliverance, to bring up the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> we read in the <hi>Twelfth Chapter</hi> of <hi>Exodus,</hi> That the same Night in which he did it, he commanded them to <hi>kill a Lamb,</hi> and <hi>eat it after a solemn manner,</hi> with bitter herbs, <hi>and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened-bread</hi>; and to continue every Year, by a constant repetition of that <hi>Sacred Ceremony,</hi> the Memory of that Deliverance which he had wrought for them.</p>
            <p>In like manner our Saviour Christ, being now to fulfil that <hi>Redemption,</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ereof the other was but a <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Representation,</hi> takes care for a <hi>Solemn Memorial</hi> to be continued of it in all Ages of his <hi>Church</hi> to the End of the World. He institutes another and better <hi>Supper</hi>; and the Observation whereof should not only be the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration</hi> of his Delivering us, but to the worthy Partaker of it, the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation also of all the Benefits of it. He takes <hi>Bread, blesses</hi> it, and <hi>breaks</hi> it; He takes the <hi>Cup,</hi> and <hi>blesses</hi> it, and distributes <hi>both</hi> to his <hi>Disciples</hi>; and then in the words of the <hi>Text,</hi> bids them also <hi>do the same in Remembrance of
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:59924:202"/>
Him:</hi> That as the <hi>Jewish Church</hi> had by their <hi>Paschal Feast</hi> hitherto kept up the Memory of God's once <hi>delivering</hi> their <hi>Fathers</hi> from the <hi>destroying Angel</hi> in the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi>; so should we from henceforth by this <hi>Feast</hi> of <hi>Eucharist</hi> continue the <hi>remembrance</hi> of that infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>better Redemption</hi> which he was just now about to purchase by his <hi>own Death</hi> upon the <hi>Cross</hi> for us.</p>
            <p>And this is no doubt the first and most proper design of these words. But now, <hi>Secondly,</hi> If we consider them not only as a <hi>Command,</hi> but as they are, a <hi>Direction,</hi> to inform his <hi>Apostles</hi> first, and then <hi>us,</hi> how we should celebrate this <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi>; they will then add thus much to our former Account, namely, that we have here not only in general a <hi>Command</hi> to continue the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in this <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> but moreover an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction</hi> also, <hi>after what manner</hi> we are to do it.</p>
            <p>That as our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> here <hi>took</hi> the <hi>Bread, blessed</hi> it, and <hi>brake</hi> it, and <hi>gave it to his Disciples, saying, Take, Eat, this is my Body which was given for you</hi>: As he <hi>took</hi> the <hi>Cup, blessed it,</hi> and <hi>gave it to them, saying, Drink ye All
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:59924:203"/>
of this</hi>; so should those who now mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister in <hi>Holy Things,</hi> when they stand at the <hi>Altar,</hi> and set forth the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in this <hi>Sacred Memorial</hi> of it, after his <hi>Example,</hi> and in <hi>Obedience</hi> to his <hi>Command,</hi> in like manner <hi>take,</hi> and <hi>bless,</hi> and <hi>distribute</hi> these Sacred <hi>Elements</hi> to all those who <hi>partake</hi> with them in this <hi>Sacrament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>* As the <hi>Apostles</hi> received first the <hi>Bread,</hi> then the <hi>Cup</hi> too at his Hands; so should all they who supply the place of the <hi>Apostles</hi> at our <hi>Tables,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive both the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> of these after their <hi>Example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>* And whosoever he be that celebrates this <hi>Holy Feast</hi> in any other manner than the <hi>Blessed Jesus</hi> did, and has given us a Command to do it, he therein both departs from the <hi>Example</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and violates the design of his <hi>Precept,</hi> who not only in that particular manner, as so many of the <hi>Holy Pen-men</hi> have set forth to us, establish'd this <hi>Sacrament</hi> Himself, but in the words of my <hi>Text,</hi> has expresly commanded us to continue it for ever in the same manner in which he established it, <hi>Do this in Remembrance of Me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="389" facs="tcp:59924:203"/>But here therefore let me not be mis-understood: For when I say that our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> in my <hi>Text</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his <hi>Apostles</hi> to <hi>do this in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him,</hi> did not only in general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to perpetuate the Memory of his Death by this <hi>Holy Ordinance</hi> for ever, but did moreover direct them <hi>after what Manner</hi> they should do it: I do not mean to signifie thereby, that we ought to look upon our selves to be so tied up to the <hi>Example</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> as not to be at liberty to depart in any the least Circumstances from that first <hi>Celebration</hi> of it: For then we must never administer nor receive this <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> but <hi>after Supper,</hi> in a private Chamber, or upper Room, to Men only, and not to Women, and those just <hi>twelve,</hi> neither more nor less, and <hi>lying along with our Heads in one anothers Bosoms,</hi> as the <hi>Apostles</hi> now did, and which I suppose no <hi>Christian,</hi> of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Persuasion</hi> he be, does at all think himself obliged to do.</p>
            <p>But my meaning herein is this; That in those things wherein the <hi>Nature</hi> of this <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> consists, and which the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> have recounted to us on purpose to direct us in the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of it; in those we are not to depart from our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Institution,</hi> nor to presume to set up our own Innovations, as the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> has most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously done in opposition to, and even in defiance of our <hi>Blessed Lord</hi>'s Appointment.</p>
            <p>To receive the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> in this or that <hi>posture,</hi> with such or such particular <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> these are things wholly foreign to the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi> of this Blessed <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such as may in different places and Ages be different. And every Christian ought to comply with what is used and prescribed in that <hi>Church</hi> with which he communicates.</p>
            <p>But for those things in which the very Nature of this <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> is concern'd; for such <hi>parts</hi> as constitute the <hi>integrity</hi> of it, and serve the more lively to set it off as a memorial of the Death and Passion of <hi>Christ,</hi> and which therefore we must look upon our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour</hi> to have sealed with his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Command, <hi>Do this</hi>; In these, I say, we are to keep close both to the <hi>Example</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and to the <hi>Command</hi> of the <hi>Text</hi>; and when he has distinctly instituted this <hi>Holy Supper</hi>
               <pb n="391" facs="tcp:59924:204"/>
in <hi>Two Kinds,</hi> not dare to command Men, under the pain of an <hi>Anathema,</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> that <hi>One alone</hi> is <hi>sufficient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this may suffice for the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former part of my <hi>Text,</hi> What it is we are to understand by that Phrase of my <hi>Text, Do this.</hi> I go on, <hi>Secondly,</hi> to enquire,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What it is to <hi>do this in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is, I think, agreed on all hands, That the <hi>Design</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> in this <hi>Command,</hi> was to set forth the great End of his Instituting this <hi>Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; viz.</hi> That it was to <hi>keep up</hi> in our <hi>own Minds,</hi> and <hi>set forth</hi> to others, a solemn and lively Remembrance of his dying for us, and of the great Benefits and Advantages that accrue to us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. And however it be pretty hard to reconcile this plain Design of this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi> with what those of the <hi>other Communion</hi> now make to be the main business of it; namely, <hi>to be a true and proper Propitiatory Sacrifice for the Sins of the Living, and of the Dead; in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing differing from that upon the Cross, but only in the manner of the Oblation:</hi>
               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:59924:205"/>
A <hi>remembrance</hi> being ever of things ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from, not present with us; and the same <hi>Sacrifice</hi> very improperly said to be a <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Memorial</hi> of it self; yet so clearly is this design of this <hi>Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> here declared to be for the <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Passion,</hi> that they have chosen rather to encounter all these Absurdities, than to adventure to deny what our <hi>Savior</hi> has so very plainly delivered as the <hi>End</hi> of this <hi>Institution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though it is not therefore to be doubted, but that the Intention of our Blessed <hi>Lord</hi> in this Command, was to oblige us, by such a Solemn <hi>Ceremony</hi> as this, to continue the <hi>Memory</hi> of his <hi>Death</hi>; yet we are not therefore to think, that all we have to do when we come to the <hi>Holy Table,</hi> and attend on this <hi>Great Memorial,</hi> is simply to <hi>remember</hi> or call to mind the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of our <hi>Saviour.</hi> No, this is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to answer either the meaning of this <hi>Command,</hi> or the design of this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</hi> The word in the Original, which we here render <hi>Remembrance,</hi> is very <hi>emphatical,</hi> and imports not a bare calling to <hi>mind,</hi> but a renew'd <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration.</hi> It regards the Affections of the Heart, as well as the Action of
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:59924:205"/>
the Mind. In a word, it denotes not so much a <hi>private Remembrance,</hi> as a <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>solemn Commemoration</hi>; when in our <hi>Apostle</hi>'s Phrase, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. we do <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>annunciate</hi> and <hi>shew forth</hi> to others, at the same time, that we thus <hi>call to mind</hi> our selves, <hi>the Lord's Death</hi>; and that with all those pious motions and resentments that befit so excellent and so advantageous a <hi>Remembrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To know therefore what it is that our Saviour here requires of us, when he bids us to <hi>do this in Remembrance of Him,</hi> two things will be necessary to be considered by us:
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>First,</hi> What it is that we are to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> or <hi>shew forth,</hi> when we come to this <hi>Holy Sacrament?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> In <hi>what manner,</hi> and with <hi>what Motions</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> we are to do it?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And, <hi>First,</hi> let us examine,</p>
            <p>What it is that we are to <hi>remember</hi> or <hi>shew forth,</hi> when we come to this <hi>Holy Sacrament?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="394" facs="tcp:59924:206"/>Now this in general St. <hi>Paul</hi> here tells us is his <hi>Death, ver.</hi> 26. that is, that bitter <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> which he was just then about to undergo for our sakes, when he established this Solemn <hi>Memorial</hi> of it. <hi>For</hi> (says he) <hi>as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do shew forth the</hi> LORD<hi>'s</hi> Death <hi>till his coming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because a bare <hi>Remembrance</hi> of the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Consideration either of the <hi>cause</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of it, or of those infinite <hi>Advantages</hi> which accrue to us thereby, will afford but a very imperfest <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> to us. We must therefore, for a full discharge of this duty, and to raise up in our Souls those suitable resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we ought to bring to this Holy Administration, take a farther and more particular prospect of it: And consider,
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>First,</hi> What our <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Condition</hi> was that obliged our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> thus to <hi>die</hi> for us?</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> What that <hi>Death</hi> &amp; <hi>Passion</hi> was which he underwent for our sakes, and has therefore commanded us to <hi>remember</hi> in this <hi>Holy Sacrament?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="395" facs="tcp:59924:206"/>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What the Benefits are that accrue to us thereby?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And, <hi>First, To do this in</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance <hi>of Christ,</hi> will engage us to call to mind, what our State and condition was, that obliged our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> thus to <hi>die</hi> for us.</p>
            <p>For however we were by <hi>Baptism</hi> wash'd from all the <hi>Guilt,</hi> and delivered from the <hi>Punishment</hi> of our <hi>Original Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,</hi> and admitted into the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and made Heirs of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> of <hi>Eternal Glory</hi>; yet we are not therefore to think our selves ever the less concerned when we come to this <hi>Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> and shew forth that <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> by which our very <hi>Baptism</hi> it self was consecrated into a <hi>laver</hi> of <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> there to call to mind that wretched State in which we once were, and must for ever have lain, had not the <hi>Blessed Jesus given himself up unto Death for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I should indulge too much your Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity in an Argument of this moment, should I enter on that vain Speculation which the <hi>School-men</hi> first started, and has
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:59924:207"/>
since been made the Sport and Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our Modern <hi>Scepticks</hi> in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; Whether <hi>God</hi> could not otherwise have provided for the Pardon and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind, than by the <hi>Death</hi> of his <hi>Son?</hi> For since it was the Pleasure of <hi>God</hi> to pitch upon this way of doing it, to what purpose is it for us vainly to enquire whether he might not have made use of some other? This we ought at least to believe, That <hi>God</hi> had his Reasons for preferring this; and that however we ought not so far to tye up the Power and Liberty of our <hi>Creator,</hi> as to presume to say he could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise have <hi>redeem'd</hi> us, than by the Death of <hi>Christ</hi>; yet thus much we may, and 'tis our duty to conclude, That none could have better, or so well have answer'd the great Ends both of his <hi>Justice</hi> and of his <hi>Mercy</hi>; or more illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously have set forth the Riches of his Love and Favour to Mankind; or more powerfully have engaged us to a suitable return of Love to him; or more clearly have convinced us of the hatred of God to Sin; or more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually have stir'd us up to our utmost endeavours to live as we ought to do, and as becomes those who had been
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:59924:207"/>
so wonderfully <hi>redeem'd</hi> by the <hi>precious Blood</hi> of the <hi>Son of God</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>But though this then be a <hi>Question</hi> otherwise of more <hi>Curiosity</hi> than <hi>Vse</hi>; and raised for the most part rather to <hi>cavil</hi> at <hi>Religion,</hi> than to magnifie the Power of it; yet may it here perhaps be of some benefit to us, to fill our Souls with the highest resentments of Love and Gratitude to our Great <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi> to consider not only from what <hi>Miseries</hi> he has delivered us, but with what a <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>readiness,</hi> and <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will</hi> to us he did it. No, <hi>God</hi> was not <hi>constrain'd,</hi> nor any <hi>necessity</hi> put upon our <hi>Saviour Christ,</hi> as if either the one <hi>must</hi> have <hi>died,</hi> or that the other could not by any other means have reconciled Mankind unto himself. It was the free Choice of both, by this means, the better to magnifie their <hi>Love</hi> to us, and to secure our <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> to them again; that so, as St. <hi>John</hi> says, 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> iv.19. <hi>We may love God, because he first loved us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is that the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> every where set out to us the whole business of our Salvation, as the effect of the <hi>free Choice</hi> and <hi>Pleasure of God.</hi> So says St. <hi>John, cap.</hi> iii.16. <hi>God so
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:59924:208"/>
loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life.</hi> So says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> i.9. where he makes the business of our <hi>Redemption</hi> to have been the <hi>eternal purpose</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> before <hi>Adam</hi> had yet sinned, or by consequence before there could be any necessity of <hi>Christ</hi>'s dying for us; <hi>who hath saved us,</hi> says he, <hi>and called us with an Holy Calling, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our works, but according to his own purpose, and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the World began.</hi> And of our Blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> the same <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, not only that <hi>He gave Himself for us,</hi> Tit. ii.14. but that he did it with all imaginable readiness, and with the same good-will with which God designed it, <hi>Lo I come</hi> (says he) <hi>to fulfil thy Will, O God,</hi> Heb. x.7, 9. And again in St. <hi>John,</hi> speaking of <hi>laying down his life for us,</hi> he declares,<note place="margin">Joh. x.18.</note> 
               <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my self; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such therefore was the <hi>love</hi> of our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> to us, in freely giving up himself to the <hi>Death</hi> for us. And
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:59924:208"/>
for the reason that induced him to it, and the benefits which thereby accrue to us, I shall not need to say either what or how great they were. Indeed, the time would fail me, should I go about particularly to lay them all before you. Miserable was the State, and deplorable the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind, beyond any thing that we are able almost to conceive. <hi>We</hi> were <hi>all dead in Trespasses and Sins,</hi> and must for ever have lain both under the <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Punishment</hi> of our <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,</hi> had not the Blessed <hi>Jesus</hi> opened to us the Gates of Heaven, and sealed a <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi> with <hi>his own Blood,</hi> for the <hi>Remission</hi> of our <hi>Sins.</hi> Our <hi>Nature</hi> was <hi>decayed,</hi> and that he has restored; so that whereas before we had <hi>no sufficiency</hi> of our selves, we have now <hi>a sufficiency of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. iii.5. Phil. iv.13.</note> 
               <hi>and can do all things through Christ that strengthens us.</hi> Our <hi>Sins</hi> had got the <hi>dominion</hi> over us; and these he has not only very much prevented by his <hi>Grace,</hi> but will also utterly wipe away by his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for us. We were under a miserable Sentence of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi>: But Christ has now took away the <hi>sting</hi> of the one,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:59924:209"/>
and the <hi>danger</hi> of the other; so that our <hi>Temporal Death</hi> is no longer a <hi>Punishment,</hi> but rather a Blessing to us; and the <hi>Eternal Judgment</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> shall, instead of being our <hi>Condemnation,</hi> prove to us <hi>perfect Absolution,</hi> and <hi>a glorious Reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the blessed Change which has been made in our Condition, and which certainly ought to render the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> of our <hi>Text</hi> most dear and precious to us.</p>
            <p>But I must not insist any longer upon this Point; I am persuaded there is no one that now hears me, so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the <hi>great Mystery of Godliness,</hi> as not to be fully acquainted with this <hi>first</hi> and <hi>chiefest Foundation</hi> of all our Faith. Nor have I mentioned that little which I have now remark'd of it, so much to instruct you in what you ought to make a great part of your <hi>Memorial</hi> when you come to this <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi>; as rather if it shall please God to stir up some Affections both in my self and you, that may be suitable to a serious Reflection on all these things: There being nothing, it may be, in the World, more apt to fill our Souls with that due resentment
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:59924:209"/>
we then especially ought to have of the <hi>Death of Christ</hi> when we come to this Sacred <hi>Memorial</hi> of it, than to consider the wretched condition from which we were delivered by it; nor more apt to engage us to <hi>live</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes those who have been freed from such unspeakable Miseries, and are now put into a capacity of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Glory; and without which our <hi>remembrance</hi> of him in this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> will be a Reproach, and a Scandal, not an Honour and a Service to him; we shall forfeit all the benefits of that <hi>Death</hi> we are call'd to commemorate; and as our <hi>Apostle</hi> phrases it, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. of this <hi>Chapter, Eat and drink our own Damnation, not discerning the Lord's Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the first thing we are to do in pursuance of the Command of the <hi>Text, This do in Remembrance of Me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This <hi>remembring</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in this <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> will oblige us to consider what that <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> was which he underwent for our sakes, and commanded us in this place to continue the <hi>Memory</hi> of in this <hi>Institution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="402" facs="tcp:59924:210"/>And this to be sure must be the proper business of every one when he comes to this <hi>Holy Table.</hi> But now, what, or how great those <hi>Sufferings</hi> were which the Blessed <hi>Jesus</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went for us, it is not for me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to declare unto you. Great and terrible are the Accounts which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> every where give us of them. How doth <hi>Isaiah</hi> set forth to us in his <hi>Prophecy,</hi> the <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Shadow</hi> of them? He tells us, That he should be <hi>a Man of sorrow,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. liii.3,</note> 
               <hi>and acquainted with grief; without form, or comeliness, or beauty, that we should desire him.</hi> He represents him as labouring under all the Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Afflictions that were due to the Sins of a wicked and incorrigible world.<note place="margin">— 4,</note> 
               <hi>Surely</hi> (says he) <hi>he hath born our griefs, and carried our sorrows: We esteemed him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted</hi>;<note place="margin">— 5,</note> But <hi>he was wounded for</hi> our <hi>transgressions, he was bruised for</hi> our <hi>iniquities; the chastisement of</hi> our <hi>peace was upon him, and by his stripes</hi> we <hi>are healed.</hi>
               <note place="margin">— 6.</note> 
               <hi>All we like Sheep have gone astray, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of us all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="403" facs="tcp:59924:210"/>Thus did <hi>Isaiah</hi> speak of the <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> when he <hi>foresaw</hi> his <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>prophesied</hi> of his <hi>Passion</hi>: And if we look into the Accounts which the <hi>Holy Evangelists</hi> give us of the Accomplishment of it, we shall find those exceeding whatever we are able to comprehend of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we consider the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of his Suffering, it was accompanied with all the bitter Aggravations of Misery that can well be imagined. For indeed, what else can we say of the Mockeries and the Insults, of the Scorns and Reproaches that appeared in all the parts of his <hi>Passion?</hi> Of the Baseness and Treachery of his <hi>Disciples,</hi> and of the barbarous Malice and Cruelty of his <hi>Enemies?</hi> How was he <hi>betray'd</hi> by one of his own <hi>Apostles, deny'd</hi> by another, <hi>forsaken</hi> by all, <hi>condemn'd</hi> at one of those Feasts that brought together all the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>Jerusalem</hi>? And that for two of the most grievous Crimes that could be laid to the Charge of an <hi>innocent</hi> Soul; <hi>Blasphemy</hi> against <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Sedition</hi> among the <hi>People; Set at nought</hi> by the <hi>Soldiers; Execrated</hi> and <hi>Abjured</hi> by his <hi>own Countrymen;
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:59924:211"/>
Adorn'd</hi> as a <hi>mock King,</hi> that he might be the more derided by them; and then finally, to compleat the Tragedy, <hi>Executed</hi> by a Death not only the most <hi>scandalous,</hi> but the most <hi>painful</hi> of any in the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Which therefore brings us to a Second Consideration of his <hi>Passion</hi>; namely, of the <hi>Pains</hi> and <hi>Torments</hi> of it. And here I shall not enter upon any long Account of the <hi>Cruelty</hi> of that Death, which has been thought suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient by those whose kind of <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> it was to give a <hi>general Name</hi> to the <hi>greatest Torments,</hi> by derivation from this one, as the highest and chiefest of all. The <hi>Wounds</hi> of the <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Feet,</hi> which the Nails made when he was fastned to the <hi>Cross</hi>; the <hi>Agonies</hi> and <hi>Convulsions</hi> of his <hi>whole Body,</hi> when he <hi>hung</hi> upon it; the <hi>slowness</hi> of <hi>dying,</hi> not to say any thing of those <hi>Furrows,</hi> which, in the <hi>Psalmist</hi>'s Speech, they had before made with their <hi>Scourges</hi> upon his Back.<note place="margin">Psal. cxxix.3.</note> All these sufficiently declare to us an extraordinary Suffering, and may warrant us to cry out with the <hi>Prophet,</hi> in the Reflection on it, <hi>Is it nothing to you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. i.12.</note> 
               <hi>all ye that pass by,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:59924:211"/>
behold and see if there be any sorrow like unto this sorrow wherewith the</hi> Lord <hi>afflicted</hi> his own Son <hi>in that day of his fierce anger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And yet still all this was but the least part of his <hi>Passion</hi>; and the <hi>anguish</hi> of his Soul, those <hi>unknown Sufferings</hi> he underwent within, far exceed whatever <hi>Torments</hi> his <hi>Enemies</hi> were able to put him to. They were these that made him <hi>sweat great drops of blood</hi> in the <hi>Garden,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. xxii.44.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever the Officers had seiz'd him, or begun to inflict the least Punishment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. They were these that made him not only declare to his <hi>Disciples,</hi> That <hi>his Soul was exceeding sorrowful,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. xxvi.37, 38.</note> 
               <hi>even unto death</hi>; but carried him farther, in the bitterness of his Grief, to <hi>pray</hi> three several times to his <hi>Father</hi> with the <hi>greatest importunity;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. xxii.44.</note> 
               <hi>That if it were possible this Cup might pass from him.</hi> And when at last it could not be, but that he must drink off the very dregs of it, forced that vehement Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulation from him, <hi>My God, My God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. xxvii.46.</note> 
               <hi>why hast thou forsaken me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been the rashness of some, from all these Expressions of his <hi>Grief,</hi> but especially from the last, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:59924:212"/>
That our <hi>Saviour</hi> in his <hi>Passion</hi> underwent all the <hi>Punishment</hi> that all the <hi>Elect</hi> of <hi>God</hi> should have suffered for all their Sins; and, in short, That he bore in his mind the very <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>torments</hi> of the <hi>Damn'd.</hi> But it is not necessary, nor indeed agreeable to a right Belief, to run to any such Extremity. His <hi>Sufferings</hi> were indeed <hi>great,</hi> but they were not such as either excluded him from the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> of God in the midst of them; nor accompanied with any <hi>despair,</hi> which is always one, and that not the least part of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's <hi>torment</hi> in another World. He <hi>died,</hi> and went <hi>down</hi> into the <hi>Grave</hi>; but his <hi>Soul</hi> was <hi>not left in the regions of the dead,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. ii.27.</note> 
               <hi>nor did his flesh see corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> His <hi>Punishment</hi> was short in the duration, and the intenseness of it, though very <hi>grievous,</hi> yet no more than was agreeable to the <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Man to bear:</hi> And we must not so speak of the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> as to forget, that though he was <hi>God</hi> when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went them, yet that he <hi>died,</hi> and <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered</hi> as he was Man.</p>
            <p>Thus therefore must we call to mind the <hi>Passion</hi> of our Blessed <hi>Lord</hi>: We must go through all the stages of it
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:59924:212"/>
with care and exactness; and neither <hi>diminish</hi> the <hi>Horrour</hi> of what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by an <hi>imperfect Memorial</hi> of it, nor do violence at once both to the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Innocence</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> by straining it up to a greater heighth than either the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> or the <hi>Honour</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> or his <hi>Humane Nature</hi> in which he suffered, will permit us to do.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Second</hi> thing we are to <hi>remember</hi> when we come to the <hi>Holy Table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> The <hi>Third</hi> and last thing here required of us, is, Having called to mind the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Evils</hi> from whence we are <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered</hi> by them, to consider finally, what the <hi>Benefits</hi> are that accrue to us thereby.</p>
            <p>It is not to be doubted, but that there must be somewhat very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary for which the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> should Himself come down from Heaven, and not only <hi>humble himself</hi> so far as to <hi>take upon him the form of a Servant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. ii.7.</note> but <hi>being made in the similitude of a Man,</hi> expose himself to all those vile and
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:59924:213"/>
cruel <hi>Sufferings</hi> I but just now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted. And indeed the <hi>Benefits</hi> which he purchased for us by his <hi>Death,</hi> were not at all inferior to the Punishment he underwent for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of them: And to speak them all in one <hi>general Conclusion,</hi> he purchased the <hi>Redemption</hi> of a <hi>lost, miserable, sinful World</hi>; we were all before <hi>dead</hi> in <hi>Trespasses</hi> and <hi>Sins</hi>; we are now raised to the <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Assurance</hi> of <hi>Everlasting Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here therefore I will be a little more particular. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> By these <hi>Sufferings</hi> our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> delivered us from the <hi>Curse</hi> which descended to us by our first Parents <hi>Transgression,</hi> and from that Eternal Punishment which must otherwise have been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of it.</p>
            <p>For not to enter now into any scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Enquiry concerning the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> or the Grounds upon which God is supposed to <hi>impute</hi> it to us: Or how far we should have been either condemn'd or not for the <hi>Actual Sin</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Eating</hi> of the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:59924:213"/>
               <hi>forbidden Fruit:</hi> This at least cannot be doubted of by any, That our <hi>Nature</hi> is now much degenerated from that <hi>primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Purity</hi> in which <hi>Man</hi> was at <hi>first created</hi>; that we have all, the very best of us, a strange <hi>Propensity</hi> to <hi>Evil,</hi> and are <hi>born</hi> with an <hi>Impotency,</hi> if not <hi>Adverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> to that Virtue and Piety, which the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>natural Religion,</hi> as well as of <hi>revealed</hi> require of us. So that if we should allow the contentious <hi>Disputers</hi> of our Days, that <hi>God</hi> will not <hi>impute Adam</hi>'s Transgression to us for <hi>Sin,</hi> nor condemn us for a <hi>Defect</hi> which we are not our selves consenting to, but bring into the World with us; yet would this have stood us but in very little stead: Whilst we should every one of us have been <hi>Guilty</hi> of so many <hi>Actual Sins,</hi> as had not <hi>Christ</hi> purchased a <hi>Redemption</hi> for us, must for ever have sunk us down into Ruine and Destruction. And certainly we ought then to esteem it no small Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of our <hi>Saviour's Passion,</hi> that he has now <hi>delivered</hi> us from this <hi>Danger</hi>; and removed the <hi>fatal Necessity</hi> we must otherwise have lain under, of being for <hi>ever miserable,</hi> without all possibility of preventing of it.</p>
            <p>But this is only one Part, and that the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:59924:214"/>
               <hi>first</hi> and least of those Blessings which his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> has obtained for us. For,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> has not only delivered us from those Dangers to which we were before exposed; but he has put us in a new and better way of attaining to that, nay perhaps to a greater Happiness than what we should have had, if <hi>Adam</hi> had <hi>never sinned,</hi> nor by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> ever given himself an <hi>Offering</hi> for our <hi>Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is indeed the great Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Saviour's Love to us, that not content to deliver us from those Dangers that before threatned us,<note place="margin">Heb. vii.25</note> 
               <hi>He saves to the uttermost,</hi> those that come to him. And here to unfold the Greatness of this <hi>Benefit,</hi> as I ought to do, I must run through all the excellent <hi>Advantages</hi> of that <hi>New-Covenant</hi> God entred into with us by the <hi>Blood</hi> of his <hi>Son.</hi> But this would carry me into an <hi>Argument,</hi> great indeed, and worthy your Attention, but beyond the Bounds of my present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. In general,</p>
            <p>* If to have a <hi>Systeme</hi> of the noblest and most admirable <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Living</hi> that were ever communicated to the World;
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:59924:214"/>
such, as by their <hi>own Excellence,</hi> no less than by <hi>God's Command,</hi> recommend themselves not only to our <hi>Practice,</hi> but to our <hi>Love</hi> too.</p>
            <p>* If to be endued with a <hi>supernatural,</hi> Divine Assistance, to enable us to fulfil them, and overcome all those <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> that may at any time seek to draw us from them.</p>
            <p>* If to be assured, That upon our hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Endeavours and earnest Prayers to <hi>God,</hi> this <hi>Grace</hi> of his shall still increase in us, according as we sincerely apply our selves to make use of it, or as other <hi>Circumstances</hi> shall happen to put us in need of it.</p>
            <p>* If besides this Help to keep us from sinning, to live under a <hi>Gracious Promise</hi> of <hi>Pardon</hi> for those <hi>Sins,</hi> which many times we shall commit, notwithstanding all our Labour to the contrary, upon our humble <hi>Confession</hi> and hearty <hi>Repentance</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>* If to know that for all these Ends, we have a <hi>Redeemer</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> who <hi>stands continually in</hi> the <hi>Presence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to make <hi>Intercession</hi> for us, and <hi>represent</hi> to his <hi>Father</hi> that <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> which he underwent on purpose, that he might obtain this Forgiveness for us; In a Word,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="412" facs="tcp:59924:215"/>* If to be undoubtedly secured, That whatever becomes of us now, yet let us but sincerely labour, what in us lies, to fulfil our Duty, and we shall be in a little Time <hi>eternally happy</hi> in the Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all these Blessings in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our Saviour; That yet a few Years and our <hi>High-Priest</hi> shall again return in Glory, and pronounce the great and final <hi>Blessing</hi> upon us, which shall instate us in <hi>Joys</hi> never to be forfeited:</p>
            <p>If I say, to live under the Conduct of such a <hi>Saviour</hi> and such a <hi>Religion</hi>; to have the Comfort of so great <hi>Promises now,</hi> and the blessed Assurance of such <hi>Glory</hi> hereafter, may be esteemed a <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi> as indeed what can we think of it, but to be the greatest <hi>Blessing</hi> that a <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God</hi> could bestow upon his <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> or a <hi>Divine Saviour</hi> purchase for his Servants: All this, and many other <hi>Benefits,</hi> which I cannot now so much as mention to you, Christ purchased for us by his <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and calls upon us in this <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> to remember with the <hi>highest Joy</hi> and the most <hi>grateful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which brings me to the other thing proposed, for the full <hi>Explication</hi> of the <hi>Duty</hi> here required of us: <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="413" facs="tcp:59924:215"/>Secondly, * After <hi>what Manner,</hi> and * With <hi>what Affections</hi> it is, that we are to <hi>Do this in Remembrance of Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the former of these,</p>
            <p>I. The <hi>manner,</hi> How we are here to <hi>remember</hi> Him;</p>
            <p>I have already observed, That the original Word, which we here render <hi>Remembrance,</hi> is very <hi>emphatical,</hi> and implies not any calling to Mind all these things, but a <hi>frequent renewed Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration</hi> of them: And that especially such, by which we may not only <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> our selves, but also set forth to others the <hi>Memorial</hi> of them. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets it, v.26. <hi>As often as ye eat this bread and drink this Cup, [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] annunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, shew forth, make a solemn Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Lord's Death until his coming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so indeed the very Design of this <hi>Institution</hi> will oblige us to understand it.</p>
            <p>When our <hi>Saviour</hi> first celebrated this Holy <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and commanded his <hi>Disciples,</hi> by the like Sacred <hi>Ceremony,</hi> to continue the <hi>Memory</hi> of his Death,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:59924:216"/>
until the End of the World: We are told by the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> That he had just finished the <hi>Feast</hi> of the <hi>Passover</hi>; into the Place whereof he substituted this <hi>Christian Feast,</hi> and as all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of it plainly shew, designed this to have the same Place in the <hi>Christian,</hi> that the <hi>other</hi> had till then had in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>Now concerning that solemn <hi>Feast,</hi> we read in the Book of <hi>Exodus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. xii.17. xiii.3, 8, 9.</note> cap. xii.17. That God appointed it [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] <hi>for a Memorial,</hi> that is, for a solemn Recognition which the People was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make every Year, of that great Deliverance by which they were brought up out of the <hi>Land of Egypt.</hi> And in the thirteenth Chapter they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>Remember the Day in which they came out of Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. xiii.3.</note> 
               <hi>and to keep the feast of unleavened bread seven daies:</hi> And then and there solemnly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to their <hi>Children</hi> the <hi>Cause</hi> of it: namely,<note place="margin">— 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>That they did this because of that which the</hi> Lord <hi>their God had done for them when they came forth out of Egypt.</hi> To which end it was the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the <hi>Jews</hi> at this Solemnity, to have their <hi>Children</hi> propose to them the <hi>Question,</hi> What the <hi>meaning</hi> of this <hi>Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
               <pb n="415" facs="tcp:59924:216"/>
was? And thereupon the <hi>Master</hi> of the <hi>House</hi> gave a full Account to them of the <hi>History</hi> of their <hi>Deliverance</hi>; and which from thence they called the <hi>Haggadah,</hi> the <hi>Annunciation</hi> or <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi>: Because of their using it at this Time to <hi>commemorate</hi> or <hi>shew forth</hi> that wonderful <hi>Deliverance,</hi> which God had wrought for them.</p>
            <p>Such was the Nature of that <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> which <hi>God</hi> commanded the <hi>Jews</hi> to continue in their <hi>Paschal Supper</hi> of His bringing them out of <hi>Egypt</hi>: And the same is the <hi>Remembrance</hi> which our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> here commands us by this <hi>new Feast,</hi> to continue in his <hi>Church,</hi> of his <hi>dying</hi> for us: We are to celebrate it, as a <hi>solemn</hi> and <hi>Publick Memorial</hi> of that great Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance which our <hi>Blessed Lord</hi> has wrought for us; and to declare to all the <hi>World</hi> thereby what a Sense we have of his infinite Love and Mercy to us.</p>
            <p>Nay, but this is not yet all we are to do, if we will answer the full extent of the <hi>Duty</hi> here required of us. We must not only make, in this <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> our Publick and solemn Recognition of <hi>Christ's Death</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi>; but we must do it with that <hi>Affection,</hi> that <hi>Joy,</hi> those <hi>Resentments</hi> that become so great and
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:59924:217"/>
excellent a <hi>Memorial.</hi> So these kind of Expressions in <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> are for the most part to be understood; and so it is plain we must take the <hi>Word</hi> in this Place. And this is the other thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to be considered for the full un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the <hi>Text.</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>II. With what Affections we ought to come to this <hi>Holy Table,</hi> and <hi>Do this in Remembrance of Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were too much for me here, in the <hi>close</hi> of my Discourse, to resume the whole Consideration of this great <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and enter again upon a particular View of it, and shew what kind of Affections we ought to raise in our Souls, proportionable to the several Parts and Respects of it. If we are indeed so sensible as we ought to be of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>'s Love to us, in thus <hi>giving himself to the Death for us:</hi> If we have so seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously weighed, as becomes those who are called to this <hi>Feast,</hi> the mighty Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Advantages which are derived to us thereby; what Miseries we have escaped, to what Blessings we are enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled by his <hi>Sufferings</hi>; the <hi>Sense</hi> of all this will soon teach us what <hi>Motions</hi> and
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:59924:217"/>
               <hi>Affections</hi> ought to fill our Souls, that may be suitable to so great and blessed a <hi>Memorial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For indeed, who can be so ignorant as not to know, without my Remark, when he comes to the <hi>Holy Table,</hi> and there beholds the <hi>Minister</hi> of <hi>God</hi> setting forth, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, evidently before <hi>his eyes Christ crucified for Him</hi>;<note place="margin">Gal. iii.1.</note> when both his <hi>Words</hi> and his <hi>Actions</hi> call upon Him to consider,<note place="margin">Phil. ii.8.</note> How the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God humbled himself even to the death</hi> for our <hi>Redemption</hi>; and submitted his <hi>Body</hi> to be <hi>broken,</hi> his <hi>Blood</hi> to be <hi>spilt,</hi> as He there sees the <hi>Bread broken,</hi> the <hi>Wine poured</hi> out in this Celebration; that here certainly he ought with the greatest Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie of <hi>Love</hi> to contemplate this <hi>Love</hi> of his <hi>Saviour</hi> to <hi>Him</hi>; and break forth into the highest Expressions of a <hi>grateful Thanksgiving,</hi> for this mighty <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration</hi> of his <hi>Favour</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> to Him.</p>
            <p>When from this He begins to reflect, on that wretched Condition in which we all of us must have been, had not the <hi>blessed Jesus</hi> thus graciously under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the great Work of our <hi>Redemption</hi>; and by <hi>dying</hi> for us, <hi>delivered</hi> us from
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:59924:218"/>
that <hi>Death,</hi> to which we were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and raised us up to the <hi>Hopes</hi> of <hi>Eternal Glory:</hi> Where is the <hi>Soul,</hi> so dull, so un-affected with the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of such a glorious Change, as to be able to keep in his joyful Resentments of so wonderful a Deliverance; and not rather burst forth into <hi>new Songs</hi> of <hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Gladness</hi> for all the <hi>Benefits</hi> which <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Redeemer</hi> have been so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully pleased to do unto Him.</p>
            <p>But above all, who can think on that <hi>Value</hi> which the <hi>Blessed Jesus</hi> has put upon our Souls; that he thought the <hi>Salvation</hi> of them to be a Price wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy his own <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> to <hi>redeem</hi> them; and then consider, That even these very <hi>Souls</hi> for which <hi>Christ died,</hi> will yet be exposed to the hazard of a <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>worser Damnation</hi> than that from which they have been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, if we shall still go on impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in our <hi>Sins:</hi> And not presently resolve here to <hi>sacrifice</hi> all his <hi>Passions</hi> at this <hi>Altar</hi>; to lay down all his <hi>Lusts</hi> at the <hi>Pedestal</hi> of the <hi>Cross,</hi> and <hi>vow</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self entirely to the Obedience of that Saviour;<note place="margin">Tit. ii.14.</note> who, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, for this very End <hi>gave himself for us, that
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:59924:218"/>
He might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purchase to himself a peculiar people, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of good Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such Resentments as these will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally arise in every pious <hi>Soul,</hi> when he comes to this <hi>Sacred Feast,</hi> and therefore I shall not need to give any particular Directions concerning them. Only I would take occasion from this last Import of the <hi>Remembrance</hi> to which our <hi>Text</hi> calls us, To exhort you when you come to this <hi>Holy Institution,</hi> that you would take Care to raise up all these <hi>Affections</hi> and <hi>Resentments</hi> to as great a <hi>Heighth</hi> as you are able; and having done this, that you would then <hi>cherish</hi> and <hi>improve</hi> them, that being not only <hi>warm</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> upon your <hi>Souls</hi> at the present, but also rooted and engrafted into them, they may not easily cool again, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come operative upon your Lives, may <hi>encrease</hi> your <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>confirm</hi> your <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>enflame</hi> your <hi>Devotion,</hi> and keep you firm and steady to your Duty, till some new Occasion shall again call you to a new exciting of them.</p>
            <p>This will be indeed to render your <hi>Remembrance</hi> such as your Saviour here requires of you: And the frequent <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns</hi> which by the <hi>Blessing</hi> of <hi>God</hi> you
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:59924:219"/>
here enjoy of this <hi>Memorial</hi> beyond most <hi>Christians</hi> in the <hi>World</hi>; shall not only put you in a Capacity of coming still with better and more affectionate Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to this <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> but shall, by the Blessing of God, prove a most useful and excellent Assistance, to the promoting of all the other Parts of your Duty; you shall live as becomes those who know what mighty Engagements their <hi>Saviour</hi> has laid upon them; to what <hi>Hopes</hi> they are called, and by what means their <hi>Redemption</hi> was purchased for them.</p>
            <p>And as this <hi>Exercise</hi> will be the best means to <hi>prepare</hi> you to come worthily to this <hi>Remembrance,</hi> so will it be also the most powerful Motive to engage you to come <hi>frequently</hi> too. When you shall begin effectually to perceive the <hi>Benefit</hi> of your <hi>Communicating,</hi> in the still new <hi>encrease</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> in all your <hi>Actions:</hi> When being full with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Sense of the <hi>Love</hi> of the Blessed <hi>Jesus,</hi> here set forth to us, you shall find it to be the Desire and Longing of your Souls, to come often to this <hi>grateful</hi> and pleasing Declaration of it. When, in a Word, being accustomed to consider the Blessings and <hi>Advantages</hi> of that <hi>New
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:59924:219"/>
Covenant</hi> our <hi>Blessed Master</hi> has <hi>sealed</hi> to us in his <hi>Blood,</hi> and here offers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new with us in this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> you shall wish, if it might be, every Day to repeat it, and think you can never enough declare your Desires of being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the <hi>Conditions</hi> and <hi>Advantages</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>And thus have I offered to you what I suppose may suffice for the full Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Words</hi> before us. And from the Account, of which we may now easily see, What is the true <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> of this <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi>? Namely, that it was instituted by our <hi>Saviour</hi> to be a Sacred and Solemn <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial</hi> of that <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> which he underwent for us, and of the great <hi>Benefits</hi> and <hi>Advantages</hi> which accrue to us thereby. That as by the <hi>Paschal Feast</hi> among the <hi>Jews, God</hi> perpetuated the <hi>Remembrance</hi> of his preserving them from the <hi>destroying Angel</hi> first, and then delivering them from their <hi>Egyptian Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage</hi>; and engaged them to a constant, annual Return of <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> to Him for so great a <hi>Blessing:</hi> So by this better <hi>Passover,</hi> should we in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner keep up for ever in the <hi>Church</hi> a lively and affectionate <hi>Commemoration</hi> of
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:59924:220"/>
that better and more glorious Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which our <hi>paschal Lamb,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. v.6, 7.</note> the <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> has by his own Blood obtained for us; and set forth to the whole World that <hi>grateful</hi> and <hi>vigorous Sense</hi> which we have of so wonderful and blessed a <hi>Deliverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this being the true meaning and Design of this <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> we may from hence see, How great and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the Mistakes are which some have run into concerning it, with reference both to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice?</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shewn, was instituted as a <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> of the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ</hi>; It is then plain, That it is not our very <hi>Saviour Christ Himself,</hi> neither in the <hi>State</hi> of his <hi>death,</hi> nor in any other, that is here presented to us.</p>
            <p>There have been in the <hi>Church,</hi> since the time of <hi>Paschasius Radbertus,</hi> one of the first considerable <hi>Innovators</hi> that we meet with in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of this <hi>Holy Eucharist,</hi> among others two different Opinions concerning the <hi>Real</hi> or <hi>Corporal Presence of Christ</hi> in this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and both maintained
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:59924:220"/>
with no small contention at this day. One, That the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi> into the <hi>very Natural Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> so that nothing of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> themselves at all remain, but only in <hi>shew</hi> and <hi>appearance</hi>; which is what they called <hi>Transubstantiation</hi>; the <hi>other,</hi> That the true <hi>Substances</hi> of the outward <hi>Elements,</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> and the <hi>Wine</hi> do indeed remain; but that the very <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> are in an <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>supernatural manner</hi> joyned to them; so that in the Communion of them, we do together with the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> receive the true <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood of Christ</hi> into our <hi>Mouths,</hi> truly and really present, which they call <hi>Consubstantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now however the latter of these be much the more pardonable <hi>Error</hi> of the two; as neither doing any Violence to our <hi>Senses,</hi> which evidently tell us, That what we <hi>see</hi> and <hi>receive</hi> in this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> is certainly <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi>; nor contradicting the many Passages of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which declare to us the same thing; yet are they both very great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes. The <hi>natural Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not capable of <hi>existing</hi> in <hi>more Places than</hi> one at the same Time; nor to be
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:59924:221"/>
divested of the <hi>inseparable Properties</hi> of a <hi>Body</hi>; such as <hi>Extension of Parts, Space, Figure,</hi> and the like, in which the very <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Body,</hi> as it is distinguished from a <hi>Spirit</hi> does consist.</p>
            <p>But these <hi>Opinions</hi> do not only involve a plain <hi>Impossibility</hi> in the very <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Thing</hi> it self; but moreover do carry a manifest <hi>Incongruity</hi> to the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> of this <hi>Institution.</hi> For if the End of this <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> were, as our <hi>Text</hi> shews, to be a <hi>Remembrance</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; a <hi>Sign</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> of his <hi>Body</hi> broken, and of his <hi>Blood</hi> shed for us; then certainly, as in all other Cases, the <hi>Sign</hi> must be different from the <hi>thing signified</hi>: so here, the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Christ's Body,</hi> is not his <hi>Body,</hi> but the <hi>Memorial</hi> of it; the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of his <hi>Blood</hi> is not his <hi>very Blood,</hi> but the <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation</hi> of it. And thus these latter Words, <hi>Do this in</hi> Remembrance <hi>of Me,</hi> become the best and clearest Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former, <hi>This is my Body which is given for you</hi>; and shew that we are to interpret it after the same manner, as when we read in the like kind of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the <hi>Old Testament, This is the</hi> Lord<hi>'s Passover; i. e.</hi> the <hi>Memorial</hi> of that <hi>Action,</hi> when the <hi>Angel</hi> passed over
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:59924:221"/>
the Houses of the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> and destroyed them not, when at the same Time he <hi>slew</hi> the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here it may be asked; Do we then exclude <hi>Christ</hi> altogether from this <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> and leave only an empty <hi>Sign,</hi> a meer <hi>ceremonial Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> of him and no more? <hi>God</hi> forbid! Nay, but I dare say, We esteem <hi>Christ</hi> to be no <hi>less present,</hi> tho' in another <hi>manner</hi> than they: Inasmuch as in this Sacred Ordinance, he <hi>communicates</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the Benefits of His <hi>Passion</hi> in a more especial manner to every <hi>faithful Receiver</hi> of this Blessed <hi>Sacrament</hi>; and makes the <hi>Bread</hi> which he <hi>eats,</hi> and the <hi>Wine</hi> which he <hi>drinks</hi> become, not indeed by any such needless and absurd <hi>Change,</hi> as we before mentioned, but by <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Blessing</hi>; by his <hi>divine Power,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Communication,</hi> his <hi>Body broken</hi> and his <hi>Blood shed for us,</hi> to all the <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Justification.</hi> The <hi>Elements</hi> are not altered, they continue not only after the <hi>Consecration,</hi> but in the very <hi>receiving</hi> of them, the same they were before; <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> without any <hi>bodily Substance</hi> besides either veiled under those <hi>Appearances,</hi> or received together with them. But by <hi>Faith,</hi> at the same
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:59924:222"/>
Time that we take these into our <hi>Mouths,</hi> we take Him also, whom they represent, into our <hi>Souls:</hi> Not as bringing <hi>Christ</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> but raising up our <hi>Minds</hi> and our <hi>Hearts</hi> to that <hi>Holy Place</hi> where he is, we unite our selves to Him; and have all the Benefits of his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> communicated to us for the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness</hi> of our <hi>Sins,</hi> for the increase of his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> to us here, and to be at once both the surest <hi>Earnest</hi> and the most <hi>effectual Means</hi> to bring us to <hi>everlasting Happiness</hi> hereafter.</p>
            <p>This is that <hi>real</hi> but <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Presence</hi> of our Saviour in this <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which we firmly <hi>believe,</hi> and which secures to us all the <hi>Blessings</hi> and <hi>Advantages</hi> which the others can hope for, from their ungrounded and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Opinion of a <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> participation of Him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From this Account of the <hi>Design</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of this Institution it follows in the next Place; What an <hi>Abuse</hi> they have <hi>made</hi> of it, who from a <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> of a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> turn it into a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> it self; and instead of esteeming this <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> a <hi>Memorial</hi> of that <hi>offering Christ</hi> once for all made for us, suppose Him
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:59924:222"/>
to be again as <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>properly offered</hi> in it as ever he was, tho' not in the same <hi>manner</hi> that he was <hi>once</hi> upon the <hi>Cross.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not now insist so long upon this Point, as to shew not only how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary such an Opinion is to the express <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, That <hi>Christ</hi> was to be <hi>offered once for all</hi>; that <hi>by his once offering himself for us, he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified</hi>; and much more to the same purpose, in the ixth and xth Chapters to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>; but how dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to the Honour of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> whether we consider his <hi>former Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi> or his <hi>present Glory.</hi> This is plain, that if the Design of this blessed <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> were as our <hi>Text</hi> declares it, to be a <hi>Remembrance</hi> of our <hi>Saviour's dying</hi> for us, then it is not a <hi>new offering</hi> of Him; there being nothing more absurd than to say of the same <hi>thing,</hi> that it is both the <hi>Memorial</hi> of what was done many <hi>Ages</hi> ago, and the very <hi>same thing again done</hi> in <hi>Memorial of its self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. From the same Principles it will follow, That if this <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> be no more than a <hi>Remembrance</hi> of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:59924:223"/>
Christ,</hi> that then certainly those must have very desperately abused it, who pay to it that <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> that they would do, to our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself, were his true and natural <hi>Body</hi> there present.</p>
            <p>I need not say any thing to prove what the <hi>Superstition</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is as to <hi>this Matter:</hi> They here freely own it themselves, and censure us for not joyning with them in the same Service. They <hi>elevate</hi> their <hi>Host</hi> in the <hi>Mass,</hi> for the People to <hi>adore</hi> it: They have insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a <hi>solemn Feast,</hi> every Year, to be observed in <hi>Honour</hi> of it: They <hi>dedicate religious</hi> Societies thereunto; they set it forth upon their <hi>Altars</hi> to <hi>bless</hi> the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> there assembled to its <hi>Worship</hi>: If they carry it abroad, whether to the <hi>Sick,</hi> or upon the occasion of any <hi>solemn Processions,</hi> they put it under a <hi>Canopy,</hi> born all the while over it; <hi>Candles</hi> and <hi>Tapers</hi> are carried before it; and a <hi>Bell</hi> is rung all the Way that it passes, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish all that are in sight of it to <hi>fall down</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> it: And by all these and many other of their Actions, they oblige all Persons to pay the <hi>supreme Honour</hi> that they give to <hi>God,</hi> to this <hi>Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="429" facs="tcp:59924:223"/>It were easie to shew how dangerous this <hi>Adoration</hi> is, even upon their own <hi>Principles</hi>; whether we consider the Impossibility of their being ever sure that their <hi>Host</hi> is indeed <hi>consecrated</hi> as it ought to be; or that if it were, yet at least the <hi>Accidents</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> which are <hi>Creatures,</hi> and yet make up a Part of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> are by consequence joynt partakers of all their Worship. But alas! what I have now been speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shews a great deal more: Not only that the <hi>Accidents</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> have their Part in being <hi>Objects</hi> of this <hi>Worship</hi>; but that our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> indeed is not at all concerned in it. They pay their <hi>Adoration</hi> to the inanimate <hi>Creatures</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an <hi>Idolatry</hi> not much less gross, in the Opinion of some of their own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, if we are indeed in the Right, than those who fall down before a Piece of <hi>red Cloth,</hi> and pay their <hi>Adoration</hi> to a <hi>Tile</hi> or a <hi>Potsherd.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="4">4. If our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> in our <hi>Text</hi> plainly commanded his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and in them all of us, To do that in <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> of Him, which he had there done before their <hi>Eyes</hi>: if what he
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:59924:224"/>
required in order to this <hi>Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> was, That we should <hi>take Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and <hi>bless,</hi> and <hi>give,</hi> and <hi>receive</hi> these, in Memory of his <hi>Body</hi> which was <hi>given,</hi> and of his <hi>Blood</hi> which was <hi>shed</hi> for us; it will then follow in the Fourth place, That those who do not do this, have plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Institution,</hi> and do not <hi>remember</hi> him as they are commanded to do.</p>
            <p>And this alone is sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute that great Corruption of the same <hi>Church,</hi> in <hi>Communicating</hi> the People only in <hi>One Kind.</hi> And whatever Pretences they may offer for their so doing, had they as just reason otherwise for alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the order of this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as God knows 'tis plain they have not any at all; yet this would still remain a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Exception against it, That our Saviour here expresly <hi>commands</hi> them to <hi>Do this,</hi> i. e. that which himself then did <hi>in Remembrance of Him</hi>; Who gave the <hi>Wine</hi> as well as <hi>Bread</hi> to his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and repeated the <hi>Command</hi> after the one, as well as the other; and not what they should at any time after think fitting to do.</p>
            <p>And these are such consequences as
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:59924:224"/>
concern <hi>others</hi> rather than <hi>our selves</hi>; who, God be thanked, are again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from all these Corruptions, and have no otherwise any cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them, than as they serve to confirm us in our Pure and Holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practice in this matter, and ought to raise up our Souls to a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgment of God's Mercy to us, who has freed us from such great and dangerous Errors, and in which he still permits so many others to continue. But there are yet some other Conclusions to be drawn from the foregoing Reflections, and in which we may perhaps find somewhat that will be of a more near and direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to us. For,</p>
            <p n="5">5. If our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> has here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us, to <hi>Do this in Remembrance of Him</hi>; that is, to come to the <hi>Holy Table,</hi> and receive this blessed <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and make our publick and solemn Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments to him for his great Mercy in <hi>dying</hi> for us; What then shall we say of those who despising this sacred Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, do either totally absent themselves from this <hi>Memorial,</hi> or come but very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and negligently to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="432" facs="tcp:59924:225"/>This certainly must needs be a great fault, as it is evidently contrary to the express Command of our <hi>Saviour</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> before us. And if we may make any Judgment of Christ's resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, either from the Nature of the thing it self, or from the severe Punishment God threatned unto those in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> who should neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the like <hi>Memorial</hi> of the <hi>Paschal Feast,</hi> one of the greatest Provocations any Christian can almost be guilty of.</p>
            <p>If we consider the thing it self, what does he who despises this <hi>Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> and neglects to partake of it, but in effect despise <hi>Christ</hi> himself, and <hi>tread under foot the Blood of the Covenant</hi> by which we must be saved?<note place="margin">Heb. x.29.</note> And how can that Soul expect any benefit of his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Sufferings,</hi> for his <hi>forgiveness</hi> hereafter, who now will not vouchsafe so much as to make that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Acknowledgment which every Christian ought of his <hi>remembrance</hi> of it, or shew any sense of his Obligation, though we have here so plain and peremptory a Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>d to do it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="433" facs="tcp:59924:225"/>And if we look to the Denuntiations of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> against those who should thus neglect to joyn in the <hi>Jewish Passover,</hi> and shew forth this <hi>remembrance</hi> of the deliverance which that <hi>Feast</hi> referr'd to, we may, I think, have some cause to fear, how much greater shall be our Punishment, whose neglect is certainly, upon many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, much more inexcusable than theirs. <hi>If any man</hi> (says <hi>Moses) Deut.</hi> xii.15. <hi>shall eat leavened-bread</hi> in that time, <hi>that Soul shall be cut off from Israel</hi>: But more expresly, <hi>Numb.</hi> ix.3. <hi>He that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to keep the Passover, even the same Soul shall be cut off from his People.</hi> Whatever the meaning of that <hi>Excision</hi> be which God here threatned that People with; whether it be, that <hi>such a one should have no part in the World to come,</hi> as some interpret it; or, that <hi>God would cut him off by an untimely temporal death,</hi> as others: Or lastly, which was esteemed by them no small <hi>Curse,</hi> that <hi>he should die childless, and have his name put out in Israel.</hi> This is certain that the Denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation is very severe; and, if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark of a very learned <note n="*" place="margin">Aben-Ezra. vid. Fag. in Exod. xii.15.</note> 
               <hi>Rabbin</hi> be
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:59924:226"/>
true, almost <hi>particular</hi> to the thing in hand; there being but <hi>two</hi> of all the <hi>affirmative Precepts</hi> to which God made this Denuntiation, <hi>viz.</hi> to him that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the first <hi>Sacrament,</hi> of <hi>Circumcision</hi>; and this second, of the <hi>Passover.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps it will here be said, That this Commination was to those that were <hi>clean,</hi> and <hi>near at hand,</hi> and yet neglected this <hi>Holy Institution</hi>: And therefore ought not to be applied to them, with reference to the <hi>Blessed Sacrament</hi> which we are speaking of, who would gladly <hi>receive</hi> it, and have a very honourable <hi>remembrance</hi> in their hearts of the Death of <hi>Christ</hi>; but alas! either they <hi>are not clean,</hi> or <hi>are in a journey</hi>; either they are not <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,</hi> or have not the <hi>leisure</hi> to come to this <hi>Table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, God did here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain the Judgment I have mention'd, to such as were <hi>clean,</hi> and at or near to <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; but the rest were not therefore by any means excused, and permitted to neglect the partaking of it. They had time given them till the next <hi>Month,</hi> to <hi>cleanse</hi> themselves, and to come up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; and if they neglected in the <hi>second Month</hi> to keep
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:59924:226"/>
the <hi>Feast,</hi> after having omitted it in the <hi>first,</hi> there was then no farther Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for them, but they fell under the <hi>Curse</hi> of those who neglected altogether to eat of it.</p>
            <p>And this therefore may serve for a useful Admonition, as well as full Answer to the Excuses of those, who are still pretending they are not <hi>worthy</hi> to come to this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> or else have not <hi>time</hi> and <hi>leisure</hi> to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for it. If indeed this should chance by any accident to hinder them at this <hi>time,</hi> or on this <hi>occasion,</hi> from receiving of it; they ought not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to disquiet themselves, but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that in such a case our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> will make the same allowance for this <hi>Feast,</hi> that God did for that other; and permit them yet another Month to remove the Obstacle, and prepare themselves to come to his <hi>Table.</hi> But if instead of doing this, they shall still go on to insist upon these vain Pretences, and live so as not to be <hi>worthy</hi> to <hi>receive</hi> the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> and continue to <hi>live so</hi> still, without taking any care to put themselves into a better <hi>state</hi>; this will prove an <hi>aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of their <hi>Sin,</hi> not a <hi>lessening</hi> of it;
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:59924:227"/>
and their neglect will be but the more <hi>inexcusable,</hi> for being grounded on a reason so contrary not only to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of this <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> but of the whole <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> And to close all: The <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> in these words we have been so long considering, will not only oblige us in the general, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to <hi>remember</hi> his <hi>Death,</hi> by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi> this <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> but <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi> and <hi>oftentimes</hi> so to do.</p>
            <p>I have before observed, that the word which we here render <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi> does not imply a bare <hi>Memorial,</hi> but a renew'd <hi>Commemoration</hi>; to teach us, that we are often to <hi>refresh</hi> the <hi>Memory</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Death</hi> in our minds by this Sacred <hi>Solemnity,</hi> and to <hi>repeat</hi> again and again the <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> of it. And though it be pretty hard to say, how often a Man ought to receive the <hi>Sacrament</hi>; yet 'tis plain, he is not so zealous a Christian as he should be, that very seldom or never does it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="437" facs="tcp:59924:227"/>We know that in the first <hi>Ages</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> when Devotion was <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>vigorous,</hi> and Men had the most sensible impressions upon their minds of the <hi>love</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> in giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>die</hi> for us, that then they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it ordinarily <hi>every day</hi>: Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that some of those <hi>Fathers</hi> who then lived, have interpreted this <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristical Bread,</hi> to be that <hi>daily Bread</hi> which our <hi>Lord</hi> has taught us to <hi>pray</hi> for. Afterwards, as Mens <hi>Zeal cool'd,</hi> so did their <hi>frequent Communicating</hi> decay in proportion with it. At first it fell in some <hi>Churches</hi> to <hi>four,</hi> in others to <hi>three</hi> times in the Week; and in a little while it came to be the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Devotion of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>days</hi>: And at last, the necessary, least <hi>proportion</hi> established was, the three great <hi>Feasts</hi> of the Year, in which our <hi>Church</hi> still obliges all her Members to partake of it.</p>
            <p>But as he who is in a pure and holy <hi>state,</hi> can never <hi>receive</hi> it too <hi>often</hi>; so certainly it is a thing than which none would more advance our <hi>Piety,</hi> to labour as frequently as we can, to fit our selves for it. And since it has pleased God, to revive something of
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:59924:228"/>
the <hi>Primitive Zeal</hi> among us as to this particular, in bringing our Solemn <hi>Communions</hi> to a <hi>monthly</hi> course, besides other extraordinary occasions of it; I do not see what better Exhortation I can leave with you as to this Matter, than seriously to advise, and earnestly beseech every one of you, to <hi>examine</hi> and <hi>prepare</hi> your selves, then at least, to joyn with your <hi>Brethren</hi> in these <hi>Holy returns</hi>; and not deprive your Souls of the Benefits which are thus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously offered to you in this great and most useful <hi>Remembrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This will indeed both best answer the <hi>design</hi> of our Blessed <hi>Lord</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> and be the best Application, I could even wish you would make of my Discourse upon it. But then I must observe, that I speak now by way of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> not as necessarily requiring this in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the <hi>Command</hi> before us, but as the improvement I desire, if it were possible, you might all make of those Opportunities God is pleased here to reach out to you in order to this End; and which I do not see how any good Christian can with a good Conscience so frequently neglect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="439" facs="tcp:59924:228"/>In the mean time, this is the <hi>summ</hi> of all; He that despises this <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> does not only shew a light esteem of the Death of <hi>Christ,</hi> and do violence to the <hi>Command</hi> of his <hi>Saviour</hi>; but does moreover deprive his Soul of the most excellent assistance God has given us in this World, in order to our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in the next: Whereas he who comes <hi>frequently,</hi> and with that due <hi>Preparation</hi> he ought to it, will not only put himself out of all danger from the <hi>Precept</hi> before us, but will in a little while secure himself of such a measure of the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> of his <hi>Redeemer,</hi> whose <hi>Memory</hi> he here honours, as shall carry him through all the <hi>Temptations,</hi> the <hi>Sorrows,</hi> the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions</hi> of this <hi>Life,</hi> to an <hi>Eternal</hi> Enjoyment of <hi>Glory, Honour,</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality</hi> in the next:</p>

esteeming her worthy to become the <hi>Mother</hi> of our <hi>Lord.</hi> And they contain in them a kind of <hi>Prophecy</hi> of that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> which the <hi>Christian Church</hi> should in all <hi>Ages</hi> to come pay to her Memory upon the account of it.</p>
            <p>It is the Observation of our <hi>English Rhemists</hi> in their <hi>Annotations</hi> upon this Place;
<q>
                  <hi>That this Prophecy</hi> is <hi>fulfilled</hi> in their keeping her <hi>Festival Days,</hi> and saying the <hi>Ave Marie,</hi> and other <hi>Holy Anthems</hi> of our <hi>Lady.</hi> And that the <hi>Calvinists</hi> therefore (so they are pleased to stile us) for not doing of this, are not among these <hi>Generations</hi> which call our <hi>Lady Blessed.</hi>
               </q>
And in their <hi>Marginal Note</hi> on the same Passage, they very briskly ask this <hi>Question</hi>;
<q>Have the <hi>Protestants</hi> had always <hi>Generations</hi> to <hi>fulfil</hi> this <hi>Prophecy</hi>? Or do they <hi>call her blessed</hi> that derogate what they can from her <hi>Graces, Blessing,</hi> and all her <hi>Honour?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In answer to so ignorant or so malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a <hi>Calumny,</hi> and to shew that We, tho' we neither say any <hi>Ave-Maries</hi> to her <hi>Honour,</hi> nor are engaged in any other part of that unwarrantable <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition</hi> whereby they have so long disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured <hi>God,</hi> abused the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi>
               <pb n="443" facs="tcp:59924:230"/>
and scandalized the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> have yet as just an <hi>Esteem</hi> for the Holy <hi>Mother</hi> of our <hi>Lord,</hi> and proclaim her <hi>Blessedness</hi> as much as either this <hi>Prophecy</hi> requires, or any sober Orthodox Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian may be allowed to do it; I shall crave leave to make use of that <hi>Occasion,</hi> the Solemnity of this Day offers to me, to enter on the Comparison between our selves and them. And could I be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That the <hi>Blest above</hi> have this <hi>Honour</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> to be made acquainted with these solemn Exercises of their <hi>Brethren</hi> here below; I would not doubt to appeal to the Holy <hi>Virgin</hi> her self to <hi>judge</hi> betwixt us; Who they are that do the most truly <hi>honour</hi> her, We who freely pay her all that <hi>Love,</hi> that <hi>Respect,</hi> that <hi>Glory,</hi> that any <hi>Creature</hi> in her <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi> can possibly be thought <hi>capable of:</hi> Or they who by giving her more, raise her up to a <hi>State</hi> above the <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of her <hi>Nature</hi>; and so instead of <hi>honouring</hi> her, dishonour that <hi>Son</hi> whom she was so happy as to bring into the World; and that <hi>God,</hi> who thought her worthy of so great an Exaltation.</p>
            <p>Now in order to this End, I shall observe this following Method:

                  <item>I. I will shew what that <hi>Honour</hi> is which the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> is now ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Receiving, and which accordingly we our selves this <hi>Day</hi> pay to her <hi>Memory?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. I will lay before you some Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that <hi>Additional Worship,</hi> which those of the other <hi>Church</hi> pretend is due to her.</item>
                  <item>III. I will offer some of those <hi>Reasons</hi> for which we think such a <hi>Worship</hi> to be <hi>unlawful,</hi> and therefore refuse to give it to her.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>I.</head>
               <p>I begin with the <hi>first</hi> of these,</p>
               <p>I. What that <hi>Honour</hi> is which the <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Virgin</hi> is now capable of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and which accordingly we our selves pay to her <hi>Memory?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For answer to which Enquiry, I shall lay down this <hi>plain,</hi> and I suppose, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable <hi>Foundation; viz.</hi> That how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever some have been pleased to exalt the
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:59924:231"/>
                  <hi>Glories</hi> and <hi>Prerogatives</hi> of the <hi>Holy MARY</hi> to a very <hi>great,</hi> indeed to an <hi>extravagant</hi> Degree, so as hardly to leave any Comparison between her and any other <hi>Creature,</hi> whether in <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Earth</hi>; yet since they still confess her to be but a <hi>meer Creature,</hi> the Measure we must take whereby to judge, What <hi>Honour</hi> may warrantably be paid to her, must be, to consider, What <hi>Honour</hi> any <hi>meer Creature,</hi> in her <hi>Circumstances,</hi> is capable of receiving: And then, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume it cannot be justly said, That we are not of the number of those who call the <hi>Holy Virgin Blessed</hi>; who upon this Foundation do freely profess, That pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding only for that just Distance that ought to be observed between the <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> that we owe to <hi>God,</hi> and that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> which we may be allowed to give to a <hi>Creature</hi>; there is no Respect that we think too great to be given to her: Nor will we scruple to pay her any <hi>Honour</hi> that does not entrench upon our Piety, and confound the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Creatures together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Were the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> yet present upon <hi>Earth</hi> with us, we would soon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince those our <hi>Accusers</hi> that we thought no <hi>Respect</hi> too much for her, which either
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:59924:232"/>
they or we are wont to give to the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Saints</hi> yet on <hi>Earth.</hi> Now that she is departed from us, all we can do is to follow her with our <hi>Esteem,</hi> our <hi>Praise,</hi> and our <hi>Imitation</hi>: That is, To give her <hi>all</hi> that <hi>Honour</hi> which any <hi>Creature</hi> in the same <hi>Circumstances</hi> is fit to receive, or which it may be either <hi>Lawful</hi> or <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi> for us to offer to such a one.</p>

               <p>We <hi>intreat</hi> her not to <hi>pray for us,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we cannot tell how to convey our <hi>Requests</hi> to her: And tho' for ought we
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:59924:232"/>
know <hi>God</hi> might reveal them unto her; yet since he has no where promised that he will do this, nor encouraged us to call upon her to this End; we think we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in this manner <hi>pray</hi> to her without either <hi>great Folly,</hi> or <hi>great Impiety</hi>: Without <hi>great Folly</hi>; if not <hi>believing</hi> that she do's <hi>certainly</hi> some way or other <hi>understand</hi> our <hi>Requests,</hi> we yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less address to her: Without <hi>great Impiety</hi>; if in confidence that she has such an Ability, we ascribe the most peculiar <hi>Prerogatives</hi> of God to her, <hi>viz.

               </p>
               <p>But were she now upon <hi>Earth,</hi> where we could either speak to her our selves, or otherwise entertain any certain <hi>Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence</hi> with her; we should be far from discouraging any to beg the <hi>Benefit</hi> of her <hi>Prayers,</hi> or thinking them worthy of <hi>Censure</hi> for so doing.</p>
               <p>When we stand at our Altars and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the blessed <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. xi.26.</note> and <hi>set forth the Lord's death until his coming:</hi> We cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed allow our selves to do this to the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Veneration</hi> of any other, than of him only whose <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> we commemorate. But even here also
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:59924:233"/>
we do the utmost that we can to <hi>Honour</hi> her. We <hi>name</hi> her at the <hi>Holy Table,</hi> we recite there the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>God</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to her, and <hi>magnifie</hi> him with her upon the account of it.</p>
               <p>In a Word; when we <hi>confess</hi> our <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>absolve</hi> our <hi>Penitents</hi>; if we <hi>commend</hi> either our <hi>selves</hi> or <hi>others</hi> to <hi>God's Mercy</hi>: In these and the like Cases, we think it an Impiety to joyn the <hi>Daughter</hi> of <hi>Anna,</hi> with the <hi>great God,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we <hi>give Thanks</hi> for any <hi>Blessings</hi> we have receved; we chuse rather to follow her <hi>Example,</hi> and cry out with her, <hi>My Soul doth magnifie the</hi> Lord, <hi>and my spirit rejoyceth in</hi> God <hi>my Saviour</hi>; than with others to divide the <hi>Glory</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>God</hi> and her, and say, <hi>Glory be to JESVS and MARY.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we <hi>vow a Vow unto the</hi> Lord, or swear <hi>by his Name</hi>; we neither think it fitting nor lawful to joyn <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> together; lest we should thereby seem to make <hi>her</hi> the <hi>Searcher of Hearts</hi> as well as <hi>him</hi>; and a powerful <hi>Avenger</hi> of such <hi>secret Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we <hi>speak</hi> of <hi>Her</hi>; we readily give her any <hi>Attribute</hi> that either the <hi>holy Scripture</hi> warrants, or her <hi>Nature</hi> allows
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:59924:233"/>
of. But to call <hi>her</hi> a <hi>Goddess,</hi> and <hi>our selves</hi> her <hi>Suppliants</hi>; to style her <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>Divine Grace</hi>; the <hi>Refuge</hi> of <hi>Sinners,</hi> and the <hi>Ark</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi>; the <hi>Sovereign Lady</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But let these and the like <hi>Superstitions</hi> be laid aside, and which a <hi>Virgin</hi> so <hi>humble</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> cannot sure be supposed to be so much altered for the worse, as to aspire after in <hi>Heaven</hi>; let <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Worship</hi> of that be exempted, as the peculiar Due of that <hi>God</hi> who made both <hi>her</hi> and <hi>us,</hi> and whom alone both <hi>she</hi> and all of us therefore ought to <hi>adore,</hi> and then what farther remains to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim her <hi>Blessed,</hi> shall as freely be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and paid her by us, as it can be justly claimed of us.</p>

We believe her to have been a most <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>vertuous</hi> Creature: That her <hi>virgin Mind</hi> was clean and spotless, as her Body <hi>Chast</hi> and <hi>immaculate</hi>; and that she was upon the Account of both the most fit of any of all her Race or Sex for the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to overshadow, and for the <hi>Son of the most Highest to inhabit.</hi> When we consider the <hi>firmness</hi> of her <hi>Faith</hi>; the <hi>fervour</hi> of her <hi>Devotion</hi>; the excellency of her <hi>Humility</hi>; we cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a <hi>Grace</hi> extraordinary in her, working all those <hi>eminent</hi> and <hi>Divine Qualities.</hi> And tho' we are not so cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as to enter on those <hi>nicer Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in which so many have in vain

exercised themselves,<note place="margin">

                  </note> Whether she was <hi>Conceived</hi> in <hi>Sin?</hi> And if she was, How far it was <hi>restrained in her</hi> at first; and at <hi>what instant</hi> totally extinct in her <hi>afterwards</hi>? Whether she was <hi>Sanctified</hi> in the <hi>Womb</hi> of her <hi>Mother</hi>? And to what <hi>degree</hi>? And at what <hi>time</hi>?

Yet as the common condition of Mankind does not permit us without all warrant from <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> which they confess is here wanting to them, to <hi>exempt</hi> her from <hi>all Sin</hi>; so neither do we pretend to <hi>accuse</hi> her of <hi>any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for her <hi>present state,</hi> we do not at all question, but that God who shewed her such favour on Earth, hath also very highly exalted her in Heaven: So that among all the Race of <hi>Adam,</hi> next unto him who was <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>Man,</hi> we think it very probable that she has obtain'd the chiefest place in <hi>God's Kingdom,</hi> who brought forth the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> into the World.</p>
               <p>And here then let these our <hi>Accusers,</hi> who say that <hi>we are not of the number of those</hi> of whom the Blessed <hi>Virgin</hi>
                  <pb n="452" facs="tcp:59924:235"/>
in my <hi>Text</hi> prophesied, That, <hi>Behold, from thenceforth all Generations should call her Blessed,</hi> tell us, if they can: Wherein is it that we are <hi>defective</hi> in our <hi>Opinion</hi> concerning the <hi>Mother</hi> of our <hi>Lord</hi>?</p>
               <p>Is it that we deny her <hi>Immaculate Conception,</hi> and suppose her to have in this been submitted to the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>all others</hi> since the Fall of our <hi>first Parents, Christ</hi> only excepted? But then they must not forget, that this is no more than what their own Brethren of their own Infallible Church deny as stifly as we do. And if there have been <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Popes,</hi> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> and <hi>Miracles</hi> for it; yet we know there have been also <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Popes,</hi> and <hi>Visions,</hi> and <hi>Miracles</hi> against it too: And at this day there is <hi>Order</hi> against <hi>Order, School</hi> against <hi>School,</hi> about it: And as if the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Infallibility</hi> had in this Matter forsaken their <hi>Church,</hi> it could never yet be finally determined either by <hi>Council</hi> or <hi>Pope,</hi> which Side is in the right.</p>
               <p>Is it that we suspend our selves as to the Point of her <hi>Actual Sins</hi>? And see no cause to conclude, why the Blessed <hi>Virgin,</hi> though a most <hi>pure</hi>
                  <pb n="453" facs="tcp:59924:235"/>
and <hi>holy Creature,</hi> yet should not have been as capable of <hi>committing</hi> Sins, as well as all others, <hi>Christ</hi> only excepted here also, we think must be allowed to be?

deliver'd, nor will either <hi>Piety</hi> or <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sense</hi> suffer us to receive.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now for this I must observe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my <hi>Foundation</hi> before laid down, That the <hi>Holy Virgin,</hi> however <hi>highly exalted by God,</hi> being yet still but a meer <hi>Creature,</hi> our <hi>Actions</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her must be no other than what a <hi>Creature</hi> that is at such a vast distance from us, and out of all compass of <hi>Civil Communication,</hi> is capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving. And so the <hi>summ</hi> of what may warrantably be paid to her, will fall under these Three <hi>Generals</hi>:
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>First,</hi> To celebrate the <hi>Memory</hi> of those <hi>Blessings</hi> and <hi>Favours</hi> which it has pleased God to bestow upon her.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> To return <hi>Praises</hi> to <hi>God</hi> on the account of them. And,</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To endeavour what in us lies to <hi>imitate</hi> her <hi>Excellencies.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>

               <p>
                  <pb n="457" facs="tcp:59924:237"/>This is all the <hi>Honour</hi> she is capable of receiving from us; and it cannot be doubted, but that we are as careful as any to fulfil the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of our <hi>Text</hi> in every one of these <hi>Particulars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> We celebrate the <hi>Memory</hi> of those <hi>Blessings</hi> and <hi>Favours</hi> which it has pleased God to bestow upon her.</p>
               <p>Let this <hi>day,</hi> and the other Solemn <hi>Festivals</hi> we observe to the same End, be our Witness, how careful we are as to this particular. We mark it out in our <hi>Rituals,</hi> as a Day <hi>Holy</hi> unto the <hi>Lord</hi>: We assemble in our <hi>Sacred</hi> places, solemnly to recount what the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> have recorded of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Mercies</hi> to Her: And <hi>annually,</hi> as at this <hi>time,</hi> we encourage one another to <hi>bless</hi> and <hi>praise Him</hi> upon the account of them.</p>
               <p>But here the <hi>Objection</hi> made in the beginning, will rise against us. 'Tis true indeed, we do observe some of her <hi>Festivals</hi>; but yet we pass by the greater part of them: And for the main thing of all, we quite omit it, in that we say not AVE MARIA so often, and so impertinently as they do; nor
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:59924:238"/>
other <hi>Anthems</hi> of our <hi>Lady,</hi> as they call her by a new and phantastical <hi>Title,</hi> never given her either in <hi>Scripture,</hi> or by any of the ancient <hi>Fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This we confess is in some measure true: We say no AVE MARIE'S, <hi>i. e.</hi> after the manner that they do; nor can we imagin what <hi>Honour</hi> is done to the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> by the <hi>nauseous tautologie</hi> of a <hi>Salutation,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent in its season, when the <hi>Angel</hi> spoke to her upon her <hi>Conception</hi>; but now as <hi>unseasonable</hi> in the <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> as it is <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>absurd</hi> in the <hi>Repetition.</hi> But yet when we recite the History, and celebrate the Memory of that surprising <hi>Salutation,</hi> then we <hi>read</hi> it in our <hi>Assemblies</hi>; that is, we do say <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> as often as 'tis either pious or to the purpose to do it. And if for not doing it as they do, we are to be excluded out of the Number of those of whom our <hi>Text</hi> speaks; yet God be thanked we shall run but the same Fortune that the <hi>Apostles</hi> and the <hi>primitive Ages</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> did, before it was first, as they tell us, revealed to St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> and by him to the <hi>Church,</hi> how they were to <hi>recite</hi> the <hi>Rosary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="459" facs="tcp:59924:238"/>But now for the other Instances objected against us, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Feasts,</hi> and <hi>Anthems</hi> of our <hi>Lady</hi>; in these we may venture to justifie our selves: We cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Memory of all the great Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars that we know of her <hi>Life</hi>: And if upon the meer <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Fables,</hi> confess'd to be <hi>uncertain,</hi> and <hi>disputed</hi> by many among themselves, as not fit to be <hi>credited,</hi> we cannot be induced to observe more; yet in this we hope all sober <hi>Christians</hi> will acquit us, and esteem us to be very excusable in what we do: It being certainly to <hi>mock,</hi> not <hi>honour,</hi> both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Her,</hi> solemnly to <hi>commemorate,</hi> and seriously to <hi>thank</hi> God for such Blessings as at the same time we are sure <hi>He</hi> never <hi>bestowed</hi> upon <hi>Her,</hi> nor <hi>She</hi> ever <hi>receiv'd</hi> from <hi>Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the last Instance, our not <hi>reciting</hi> the <hi>Anthems</hi> of our <hi>Lady,</hi> I shall only say thus much, That we know but of one <hi>Anthem</hi> that ever she made; <hi>viz.</hi> that from whence our <hi>Text</hi> is taken; and that we are so far from not <hi>reciting,</hi> that we make it a Solemn <hi>Hymn</hi> in our daily <hi>Service.</hi> Let them who <hi>recite</hi> more, tell us, if they can, whence they had them, and by what
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:59924:239"/>
                  <hi>Authority</hi> they make use of <hi>Anthems</hi> in many places hardly to be heard without <hi>horror</hi>; and such as, to say no worse of them, do by no means befit either the <hi>Humility</hi> of MARY, to <hi>receive</hi>; or the <hi>Piety</hi> of a <hi>good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> to <hi>offer</hi> to her.</p>
               <p>And this may suffice to shew that we are not wanting in the first <hi>point</hi> of our <hi>Honour,</hi> to <hi>celebrate</hi> the <hi>Memory</hi> of God's <hi>Mercies</hi> to her. The next proposed, was,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To return <hi>Praises</hi> to <hi>God</hi> upon the account of them.</p>
               <p>And here I am sure no one can say that we are defective: The <hi>Foundation</hi> of all God's <hi>particular Favours</hi> to her being this, That our <hi>Blessed Lord</hi> was to be born of <hi>Her.</hi> And this is the Subject of all our <hi>Praises</hi> to him: Every <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> we put up to Heaven, is <hi>begun, carried on,</hi> and <hi>ended</hi> with it: So that in effect, all that part of our <hi>Religious Service</hi> which consists in <hi>giving Thanks to God</hi> for the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Mankind,</hi> is but a continued Acknowledgment of the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> done to the <hi>Holy</hi> MARY:
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:59924:239"/>
And if this be not enough, I must then again remember what I just now observed, not only that we are very careful to <hi>praise God</hi> for his <hi>Mercies</hi> to the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> and to <hi>our selves</hi> by <hi>her</hi>; but every day make use of <hi>her own words</hi> to express our grateful Acknowledgment of them, by estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing <hi>her Song</hi> of <hi>Eucharist</hi> to be the <hi>Form</hi> wherein we our selves should <hi>give Thanks</hi> to <hi>God</hi> in our <hi>Assemblies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For what is the last Instance of all, of that <hi>Honour</hi> we owe to her, the <hi>Imitation</hi> of her <hi>Vertues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may presume to say, that in this we do not come behind her highest <hi>Votaries.</hi> Not an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in <hi>her Life,</hi> but our <hi>Church</hi> exhorts us to transcribe it into <hi>ours.</hi> We may, and God knows we do, come very much short of her in our <hi>practice:</hi> But 'tis our own Infirmity, not any <hi>defect</hi> in our <hi>Churches Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Directions</hi> that we do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="462" facs="tcp:59924:240"/>Such then is the <hi>Honour</hi> which we now suppose due to the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> and which accordingly we pay to Her. Let us go on, and see in the next place,</p>

hath carried them as to this particular.

                  <hi>First,</hi> It is the very <hi>foundation</hi> of all that <hi>Superstitious Service</hi> which is now-a-days paid to her in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> to suppose the <hi>Excellency</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> to be <hi>incomparably above</hi> that of any other <hi>Saint what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever</hi>: So that whereas all other <hi>Saints</hi> are to be <hi>worshipped</hi> only with that <hi>inferior Religious Worship</hi> which they call <hi>Dulia</hi>; the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> alone is to be served with a <hi>Hyperdulia,</hi> or a Super-eminent sort of <hi>Religious Service.</hi> And that upon these three accounts, which therefore one of their own <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> has set down for us: (1.) In that
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:59924:241"/>
when
<q>God dignified her with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of being the <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>JESUS,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Contempl. on the Life and Glory of</hi> H. M. <hi>p. 4.</hi>
                     </note> he therewith created her the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Angels, Patroness</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Advocate</hi> of <hi>Sinners;</hi>
                  </q>
And that therefore as such she ought to be <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured above</hi> them.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 5.</note> (2.)
<q>Because the <hi>Veneration</hi> we give to <hi>MARY,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to <hi>JESUS;</hi> all <hi>Honour</hi> given to the <hi>Mother,</hi> tending to the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Son. And, (3.)</hi> For that <hi>Holy MARY,</hi> as the <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> is accomplished with all <hi>Natural, Moral,</hi> and <hi>Supernatural Perfections,</hi> which are and possibly may be dispersed among all pure Creatures, <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels;</hi> and therefore as she is more <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Perfect</hi> than <hi>All,</hi> so is she <hi>acceptable</hi> to <hi>God</hi> above <hi>All;</hi> and therefore ought she to be <hi>reverenced</hi> by us above them <hi>All.</hi>
                  </q>
From hence it is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That they look upon her as a Person most worthy to be <hi>called upon</hi> in all their <hi>Devotions</hi>: Insomuch that the <hi>Author</hi> I but now mentioned, recommending to his <hi>Votary</hi> the <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> towards her, lays down, among others,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 13.</note> these Two <hi>Rules</hi>: (1.) That he should have a <hi>private Oratory</hi> dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:59924:241"/>
to the <hi>Veneration</hi> of Holy <hi>MARY</hi>:
<q>
                     <hi>And (2.)</hi> That he should not enter on any Business, of what ever Nature,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Contempl. pag. 15.</hi>
                     </note> without first consulting <hi>MARY</hi> by <hi>humble Prayer;</hi> recommending its whole Progress to her <hi>Protection,</hi> and assuming <hi>her</hi> as a <hi>Guide</hi> in the pursuance thereof.</q>
And indeed tho' they do as they have occasion, <hi>pray</hi> to other <hi>Saints</hi> too as well as to the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> yet such a peculiar <hi>Confidence</hi> have they in <hi>her,</hi> that in all their <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>private Addresses,</hi> the beginning and ending, and in a Word, the whole Performance, for the most part, is divided betwixt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>her.</hi> Thus in the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Mass</hi>; in all their <hi>Liturgies,</hi> in the most solemn Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of <hi>Confession, Absolution, Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi>; in their <hi>Litanies</hi> and <hi>salves,</hi> still <hi>Holy MARY</hi> is set up as no small part of their <hi>Worship</hi>: And the reason whereof their <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Basil</hi> tells us is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Crasset de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vot. envers la V.M. par.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 20, 21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> for that she, as she is the most <hi>exalted,</hi> so she is the most ready to regard us too: And <hi>Suarez</hi> stating this very Point, Whether we ought to <hi>pray</hi> to the <hi>Blessed VIRGIN</hi>? tells us it is a <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> that we ought so to do; that the <hi>Church</hi> is sensible how much the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> of the <hi>Blessed VIRGIN above
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:59924:242"/>
any others</hi> is the most useful to us; and therefore that she, <hi>above all others,</hi> ought to be <hi>invoked</hi> by us.</p>
               <p>Now this being without Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, both the constant <hi>Opinion</hi> and <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> That the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> is to be called upon in <hi>all Places,</hi> and <hi>upon</hi> all <hi>Occasions,</hi> and by all <hi>Persons</hi>; they must by consequence suppose,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That by whatsoever means it is, some way or other she do's <hi>know,</hi> and can <hi>attend</hi> to <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Prayers</hi> that are every where made to her; and is capable of affording them such Assistance as they encourage their <hi>Votaries</hi> to ask of <hi>Her:</hi> And by consequence, that she do's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the <hi>Immensity</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; and is <hi>Omniscient, Omnipresent</hi> and <hi>Omnipotent</hi> as well as he. For else, if either she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>distinctly attend</hi> to all the Requests that are every where made to <hi>her,</hi> or be not <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>knowing</hi> them; or tho' she do's understand what is demanded of her, yet should chance not to have it in her Power to grant it to them: It must follow, That they pray at all <hi>Adventures</hi>; and to no more purpose than if one of us here, should ask a <hi>Favour</hi> of, or
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:59924:242"/>
make a <hi>Request</hi> to one of our <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Acquaintance</hi> in the <hi>Indies.</hi> And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever <hi>Piety</hi> there might be in so doing, yet I am perswaded the <hi>number</hi> of her <hi>Votaries</hi> would soon decrease, did they not hope for such an <hi>Effect</hi> of their <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses</hi> to her, as must imply her to be all that which I before inferred, as the <hi>Consequence</hi> of their calling upon her.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But this is not yet all: For in <hi>calling</hi> thus upon her, they do not only suppose her to be a fit <hi>Object</hi> of their <hi>Adoration,</hi> but by committing themselves to her <hi>Intercession</hi> for them, they do particularly set her up as an <hi>Advocate</hi> or <hi>Mediatrix</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and accordingly have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to her as such.</p>
               <p>'Tis true this is no more than what they do to the other <hi>Saints</hi> as well as the <hi>Blessed VIRGIN:</hi> They <hi>pray</hi> to <hi>God</hi> through their <hi>Merits</hi> and <hi>Intercession,</hi> and by their <hi>Mediation,</hi> as well as that of our <hi>Saviour Christ,</hi> both desire and hope the better to implore his Mercy. But then, as I before observed, That in the Business of their <hi>Prayers</hi> they look upon the <hi>Holy MARY</hi> to have a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Right to them above any other <hi>Saints</hi> whatsoever; so much more in
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:59924:243"/>
this Case, they esteem her not only to be a more effectual <hi>Mediatrix</hi> than any of the rest of the <hi>Saints,</hi> but to have a more peculiar Right to that <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi>: And which from one of their own <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Authors,</hi> I will therefore here crave leave to explain to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To be a</hi> Mediator, says he, <hi>and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the</hi> Office <hi>of such a one,</hi>

                  <hi>it is requisite that he who asks any thing in that respect, should have</hi> * merited <hi>that which he desires to obtain; that he should have</hi> * offered <hi>his</hi> Merits <hi>to that end, and that</hi> God <hi>should have</hi> * accepted <hi>of them. It is this which renders</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>our only and true</hi> Mediator. <hi>But the</hi> Saints <hi>have not</hi> * merited <hi>any Good for us during this Life, they have not</hi> * offered <hi>to</hi> God <hi>their</hi> Merits <hi>in favour of us, nor has God</hi> * accepted <hi>them to any such End. 'Tis the</hi> Blessed Virgin alone <hi>that has any</hi> part <hi>in this</hi> Glory <hi>with her</hi> Son: * <hi>For</hi> she <hi>obtains nothing for us but what she</hi> merited <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her Life:</hi> — * She <hi>has also</hi> offered <hi>all her</hi> Actions <hi>and</hi> Sufferings <hi>joyntly with those of</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>for the</hi> Salvation <hi>of all</hi> Men; * <hi>And</hi> God <hi>has</hi> accepted <hi>this</hi> Offering, <hi>as S.</hi> Bonaventure <hi>and other Divines teach.</hi> And again—<hi>She is</hi> therefore <hi>our</hi> Mediatrix,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>inasmuch as</hi>
                  <pb n="469" facs="tcp:59924:243"/>
she offered <hi>her</hi> Son <hi>freely and voluntarily to the</hi> Death, <hi>for the</hi> Salvation <hi>of</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>Such is the <hi>Title</hi> which they suppose the <hi>Holy</hi> MARY has to be our <hi>Advocate,</hi> not only <hi>above</hi> all other <hi>Saints,</hi> but in the <hi>same manner</hi> that our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> himself is: and the consequence of it appears in these two <hi>Advantages</hi> which they imagine to be in her <hi>Mediation</hi> above that of any other <hi>Saint: viz.</hi> first, "That it is <hi>more extensive</hi>:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>and the</hi> Virgin Mary <hi>alone oppose it; or should she demand any Favour, and all the</hi> Saints <hi>be set against it, her Interest alone would carry it against them all, upon the account of that Prerogative which is due to her Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as</hi> Mother, <hi>to the excellence of her</hi> Grace, <hi>and to the Perfection of her</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>And thus one would think they had given her a sufficient <hi>Authority</hi> in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi>; and yet we must go one step farther: For,</p>
               <p n="5">5. If we may conclude any thing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the <hi>Tenour</hi> of those <hi>Addresses</hi> that even by publick <hi>Authority</hi> are made to her in that <hi>Church</hi>; or from the open <hi>Declarations</hi> of some of the chiefest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that have been in the <hi>Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> She has even her self Power to <hi>Remit Sins,</hi> and to <hi>Confer Grace,</hi> and to <hi>Save</hi> those who <hi>call upon her,</hi> and trust to her for their <hi>Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the former of these their <hi>publick Addresses</hi> to Her: What else can we make of them, but that they are plain Suppositions of such an Authority in her, as I have now observed. If they <hi>confess</hi> their <hi>Sins</hi>; they do it not only to
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:59924:244"/>
                  <hi>God,</hi> but to the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> too: If they <hi>absolve</hi> their <hi>Penitents,</hi> the <hi>Merits</hi> of the <hi>Mother</hi> are joyned to the <hi>Passion</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> for their Forgiveness. If they pray, it is that <hi>Mary</hi> and her <hi>Son</hi> would bless them: If they salute her, the <hi>Complement</hi> is, <hi>Hail Queen,</hi>

to <hi>her,</hi> that by the <hi>Right which she had over her Son, she would</hi> command <hi>him</hi>?

               <p>But I shall pursue these <hi>Extravagancies</hi> no farther; from what I have said we may see what their <hi>Opinions</hi> are of the <hi>Holy MARY</hi> in that wherein they differ from us; <hi>viz.</hi> That she is to be <hi>honoured</hi> with a <hi>Religious Worship</hi> above any other <hi>Saint</hi>: That she is to be <hi>prayed</hi> to as an <hi>Advocate</hi> and <hi>Mediatrix</hi> in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>; that she has <hi>Authority</hi> to do what ever she <hi>pleases</hi> there, and in effect do's partake of the most <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>peculiar Attributes</hi> and <hi>Prerogatives</hi> of the <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> Let us enquire in the next place,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="474" facs="tcp:59924:246"/>2. What their <hi>Practices</hi> are towards her, in <hi>conformity</hi> to these <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall need say the less as to this Point, having already in great measure <hi>exhausted</hi> it in the Account I have given of the foregoing. There is so near a <hi>connexion</hi> between the <hi>Opinions</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and their <hi>Practices,</hi> founded upon them, with reference to the <hi>Blessed VIRGIN,</hi> that 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to mention the one without infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the other as <hi>consequent</hi> upon it. He that saies that the <hi>Blessed VIRGIN</hi> ought to be <hi>prayed</hi> to, do's imply, That if he believes himself in what he affirms, he must then <hi>pray</hi> to <hi>her</hi>: And so of all the other Instances I before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. But yet because this will still the more clearly shew the true state of the Difference between us, I will make a few <hi>Reflections</hi> upon the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> which is found in the other <hi>Church</hi> towards the <hi>Holy MARY,</hi> in two Considerations;
<list>
                     <item>1. Of the <hi>publick Worship</hi> that is <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered</hi> to <hi>her.</hi>

                        <pb n="475" facs="tcp:59924:246"/>2. Of the <hi>private Devotion</hi> which is usually <hi>practised</hi> and <hi>recommended</hi> by them towards the <hi>Blessed VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIN.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>For the former of these,</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>publick Worship</hi> that is given to <hi>her</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It runs through all the Parts of their <hi>Offices</hi>; and scarce any <hi>holy Exercise</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed among them that is not infected with this Superstition.</p>

               <p>Such is the publick and private Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taught by them to the <hi>Blessed</hi> VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIN.

               <p>And first let us enquire,</p>
               <p>1. Whether we may warrantably ascribe to the <hi>Blessed</hi> VIRGIN, a <hi>Capacity</hi> to understand all the <hi>Prayers</hi> that are <hi>every where</hi> made to her.</p>
               <p>It is a Subject that has long enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Minds and exercised the Pens of the <hi>Votaries</hi> of the <hi>Virgin</hi> MARY and the <hi>Saints,</hi> How or by what means it is that they understand all the <hi>Prayers</hi> that are any where made to them by any of their <hi>Suppliants</hi> on <hi>Earth.</hi> And I do not find that either they yet are,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:59924:251"/>
or seem at all likely ever to be agreed on this Point. But thus far they appear to be all of them well assured, That by whatever <hi>means</hi> it is, their <hi>Prayers</hi> are some way or other most certainly <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed</hi> to them, because that otherwise it would be a most senseless and absurd Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to <hi>call upon</hi> them.</p>

Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 20.</note> at any <hi>time,</hi> or in any <hi>place,</hi> a wise and rational Service, 'tis plain they must suppose that the <hi>Saints</hi> above, and in particular that the <hi>Blessed</hi> VIRGIN has a certain and distinct <hi>knowledge</hi> of all the <hi>Actions, Words,</hi> and even of the most <hi>secret Thoughts</hi> (forasmuch as they allow of <hi>Mental,</hi> as well as <hi>Vocal Prayer</hi> to her) of all Men here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth. But to ascribe such a Power to her, is to raise Her above the state of a <hi>meer Creature,</hi> to invest her with some of the most proper and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable <hi>Attributes</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and in effect to make, what some of them stick not freely to style her, a <hi>Goddess</hi> of her; which certainly cannot be done without a very great Impiety.</p>
               <p>It is one of the great Reasons why God requires the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> from us, because the very Exercise of it keeps up in our minds the most lively <hi>Idea</hi>'s of His <hi>infinite Nature,</hi> his <hi>unbounded Providence,</hi> and his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible Perfections.</hi> Whilst by <hi>calling every where</hi> upon him, we do in effect acknowledge the <hi>Immensity</hi> of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> which is <hi>every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>: By lifting up the Aspirations of
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:59924:252"/>
our Hearts towards him, we profess the <hi>Belief</hi> of his <hi>Omniscience,</hi> That <hi>he searcheth the Heart, and knoweth the secrets of all the Children of Men:</hi> By <hi>asking</hi> all sorts of Blessings of him, whether to deliver us from any Evil, or to grant us any Good, we confess the <hi>Sovereign Authority</hi> of his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> over us, and declare his <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> who can do whatever he pleases, and manifest our trust and dependance upon him. In a word, By all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doing this, in all places, and at the same time; we set forth the vast <hi>capacity</hi> of his <hi>immense Nature,</hi> that is able to attend, without distraction, at once, to all the Affairs of the World; and can, without confusion, both <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>answer</hi> whatever Requests are made to him.</p>
               <p>But now to suppose that any <hi>meer Creature</hi> can do this, what is it but to confound that <hi>infinite distance</hi> that above all things ought the most care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be kept up in the Minds of Men, between God and Us: And leave no Perfection in the one so proper to him, as not to be communicable to the other? And yet however they may think fit to palliate this matter, 'tis
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:59924:252"/>
plain, he that will <hi>pray</hi> with any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>reason</hi> or <hi>confidence</hi> to the <hi>Blessed</hi> VIRGIN, must suppose all this: He must in effect esteem her, what the very <hi>act</hi> of his <hi>calling</hi> upon her supposes her to be, <hi>Omniscient, Immense, Omnipresent,</hi> and even <hi>Omnipotent</hi> too. It being otherwise a most stupid thing for <hi>millions of Men</hi> every <hi>hour</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> to one who has no <hi>power</hi> to <hi>hear</hi> their <hi>Prayers</hi>; to offer up the <hi>motions</hi> of their <hi>Souls</hi> to one that cannot <hi>search</hi> or <hi>know</hi> their <hi>Hearts</hi>; and ask all manner of <hi>Blessings</hi> of her, who has neither <hi>Ability</hi> nor <hi>Authority</hi> to confer <hi>any</hi> upon them.</p>
               <p>Now 'tis upon this ground then, that, without considering of what kind the <hi>Requests</hi> are that are made to the <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> VIRGIN, we look upon the very <hi>Act</hi> it self of <hi>Invocation,</hi> to be an <hi>Act,</hi> indeed one of the most <hi>proper Acts,</hi> of <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> and by consequence such as ought to be paid to <hi>God</hi> only. And though they may pretend, that 'tis no more to <hi>pray</hi> to the <hi>Holy</hi> MARY in <hi>Heaven,</hi> than it would be to desire the <hi>Prayers</hi> or <hi>Assistance</hi> of some <hi>Friend</hi> on Earth; yet it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from what I have now been speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:59924:253"/>
that there is a very <hi>vast difference</hi> between these two; the one supposing no <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Perfection</hi> in our <hi>Friend,</hi> but what may without danger be ascribed to a <hi>Creature</hi>; the other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily implying such as are <hi>peculiar</hi> to <hi>God</hi> only. For to consider this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in a Reflection or two:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Does any Man that is <hi>well</hi> in his <hi>Wits</hi> discourse with his <hi>Friend</hi> at a <hi>thousand Miles</hi> distance from him, with that seriousness that those who worship the <hi>Blessed</hi> VIRGIN <hi>pray</hi> to Her? And yet why is the one esteemed a piece of <hi>Piety,</hi> while the other would be thought meer madness, but only that they suppose the <hi>Blessed</hi> VIRGIN, though absent from them, nevertheless to be capable of knowing what they do, while they think the other is not in a capacity of so doing? For as for <hi>God</hi>s communicating it to her, I presume he is as well able to do it in the <hi>one instance</hi> as in the <hi>other</hi>; and I think I may say, he has as much promised he will do the <hi>first</hi> as the <hi>last</hi>; that is indeed, there is no grounds that he will do it to either.</p>

                  <pb n="489" facs="tcp:59924:253"/>Or, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Were this a rational thing, would yet they themselves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that a <hi>Man</hi> should, in the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and in the midst of his solemn Devotions to him, not only <hi>desire,</hi> but in the same <hi>breath</hi> with which he <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> invoke the Assistance of a pious Christian yet <hi>living</hi> upon <hi>Earth?</hi> Would they think this no more than an <hi>act</hi> of <hi>Brotherly Charity,</hi> and which one <hi>Christian</hi> might warrantably use towards another?</p>
               <p>Much less, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Would they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the <hi>Images</hi> of a <hi>living Christian</hi> to be set up in their <hi>Churches; Candles</hi> to be <hi>burnt</hi> before them; and <hi>Incense offered</hi> to them; his Name to be put in the <hi>Liturgies</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and all the Faithful upon <hi>Earth</hi> be directed and encouraged every where to <hi>pray</hi> to Him, as a most <hi>useful</hi> and <hi>innocent</hi> piece of <hi>Piety</hi>: And with the same <hi>opinion</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> of his <hi>hearing</hi> their <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>answering</hi> their <hi>desires,</hi> as they now call upon the <hi>Blessed</hi> VIRGIN? Would they say that this were no more than to ask a <hi>private Friend,</hi> as we have opportunity, to <hi>pray</hi> for us; or
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:59924:254"/>
to desire by Letter, the Supplications of our <hi>absent Brethren</hi> in our behalf?</p>
               <p>And yet much less, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Would they permit this <hi>living Christian,</hi> not only to be thus called upon to <hi>pray</hi> for his <hi>Votaries,</hi> but to <hi>bless</hi> them too, to keep them in their <hi>Lives,</hi> and to receive them at the <hi>hour</hi> of <hi>Death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If indeed these are Instances of <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Charity,</hi> I shall for my part be content to allow, that their Devotion to the <hi>Holy</hi> MARY is no more. But if the very <hi>Supposition</hi> of such a <hi>Power</hi> as this be something beyond the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Abilities</hi> of any <hi>Creature</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> with what Conscience can it be said, that when they consecrate the <hi>Images</hi> of the <hi>Blessed</hi> VIRGIN, burn <hi>Tapers</hi> and <hi>Incense</hi> before them, list themselves under her <hi>Protection,</hi> commit all the care of their <hi>Salvation</hi> to her, call her the <hi>Queen of Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Sovereign Lady of Angels and Men</hi>; put her <hi>Name</hi> into their <hi>Liturgies,</hi> erect <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to her <hi>Honour,</hi> set apart <hi>Festivals</hi> and <hi>Days</hi> for her <hi>particular Service,</hi> and then call upon her at the <hi>same time</hi> in all <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:59924:254"/>
this as expecting no small benefit from their <hi>Prayers</hi>; and therefore certainly in a confidence that she, though Ten thousand times farther off from us, than one <hi>Christian</hi> on Earth can be from another, does nevertheless know what they <hi>call upon her</hi> for, and can and will <hi>grant</hi> their <hi>desires</hi>; I say, with what <hi>Conscience</hi> can it be preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that in all this they do but enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a <hi>Brotherly Communion</hi> with her; and in effect do no more than when a <hi>Christian</hi> here below <hi>desires</hi> a <hi>Fellow-Christian</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> for Him.</p>
               <p>It remains therefore, that to ascribe to the <hi>Holy MARY</hi> such a Power as is necessary to receive our <hi>Prayers,</hi> and to <hi>attend</hi> to our <hi>Petitions,</hi> and to <hi>search</hi> our <hi>Hearts,</hi> and <hi>know</hi> the <hi>motions</hi> of our <hi>Souls</hi> towards her, and answer us accordingly; is to raise her above the <hi>state</hi> of a <hi>Creature,</hi> and therefore unlawful for us so to do. And it is observable, that when the Ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> first began to make some kind of <hi>Addresses</hi> to the <hi>Holy Martyrs,</hi> not only the <hi>Subject</hi> of them was <hi>innocent,</hi> but the <hi>Supposition</hi> on which they went, as to this <hi>Point</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Martyrs</hi> hearing
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:59924:255"/>
them, however <hi>fanciful,</hi> yet was such as did not ascribe any undue <hi>Perfections</hi> to them. They call'd upon them, not in <hi>all places,</hi> and at all <hi>times</hi> indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, but only at their <hi>Monuments,</hi> at the <hi>places</hi> of their <hi>Suffering,</hi> where their <hi>Bodies</hi> or <hi>Reliques</hi> were interr'd, and about which they had a conceit that their <hi>Souls</hi> hovered for some time; and therefore being present with them, were capable of <hi>knowing</hi> their <hi>desires.</hi> In process of time they began to <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply</hi> the <hi>places</hi> of <hi>calling upon</hi> them; and then there grew a <hi>Question</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="494" facs="tcp:59924:256"/>But let those who presume to allow this to any <hi>Saint</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> consider a little who it is that hath said, I am the <hi>Lord,</hi> that is my <hi>Name, and my Glory will I not give unto another</hi>: And certainly then they will see some <hi>cause,</hi> if not to correct their own ungrounded <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> in this Matter, yet at least to think a little more favourably of us, that we dare not presume to joyn with them in it. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Second <hi>Point</hi> wherein we suppose them to have <hi>erred</hi> in their <hi>Opinions</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> is, That they ascribe to her the <hi>Right</hi> of a <hi>Mediatrix</hi> to <hi>intercede</hi> for us.</p>
               <p>Now by a <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Interceding</hi> for us, I do not mean such an <hi>Intercession</hi> as the Faithful here upon Earth many times make for one another; when they put up their <hi>Prayers</hi> to <hi>God</hi> to <hi>forgive</hi> their <hi>Sins,</hi> or to grant them any <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings</hi> which they stand in need of. Whether the <hi>Saints</hi> above do in <hi>general pray</hi> for us or no, is a <hi>Point</hi> which none of us can certainly resolve, and therefore is not fit to be disputed by
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:59924:256"/>
any. That they have a great deal of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> for us, is not to be doubted; but how they express it, God has no where thought fit to declare to us, nor is it therefore either fit or needful for us to enquire into it. The <hi>Intercession</hi> which I here mean, is of another nature; and implies such a <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> as is founded on the <hi>Merits</hi> of the Person that <hi>intercedes</hi>; whereby he is able to plead a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>God</hi>s <hi>Mercy</hi>: So that we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat <hi>God</hi> for his <hi>Merits</hi> to grant us his <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Forgiveness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, that this is the true Notion which those of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> have both in <hi>general</hi> of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> and in <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> of the <hi>Blessed VIRGIN,</hi> when they address to her as their <hi>Advocate</hi>; is not only clear from the very <hi>Addresses</hi> themselves which they make to her, but is moreover acknowledged by themselves in the accounts they give us of this Power which they ascribe to her. I have before observed from one of their own <hi>Authors,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Crasset,</hi> par. 1. p. 14.</note> That to be a <hi>Mediator,</hi> and to discharge the <hi>Office</hi> of such a one, Three things are required: <hi>viz. First,</hi> That he who <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes</hi> should have <hi>Merited</hi> that for which he <hi>asks: Secondly,</hi> That he should have
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:59924:257"/>
                  <hi>offered</hi> his <hi>Merits</hi> to that End: And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That God should have <hi>accepted</hi> of them: And all this, they say, is true of the <hi>Virgin MARY.</hi> She has <hi>merited</hi> all that she <hi>asks</hi> for us; She <hi>offered</hi> her <hi>Merits</hi> to be joyn'd with those of <hi>her Son</hi> for our <hi>Salvation,</hi> and God has <hi>accepted</hi> and <hi>ratified</hi> the <hi>Offering,</hi> in order to that End. Now that in this they attribute that to the <hi>Virgin MARY,</hi> which the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> have every where reserved as the peculiar <hi>Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi> of our <hi>Saviour Christ,</hi> not only St. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly declares, but the whole <hi>Analogy</hi> of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament</hi> assures us of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If first we consider the express Words of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> what can be more plain than that Declaration of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Epist. ii.5. That to us <hi>Christians</hi> there is as but one <hi>God,</hi> so but <hi>one</hi> Mediator <hi>between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransome for all.</hi> For if there be but <hi>one Mediator,</hi> and that the <hi>Man Christ Jesus,</hi> how then is the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> too our <hi>Advocate</hi> in <hi>Heaven?</hi> If the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of Christ's <hi>Intercession</hi> for us be built upon his <hi>Death,</hi> as this <hi>Text</hi> plainly
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:59924:257"/>
declares, so that he is therefore our <hi>Mediator</hi> to intercede for us in <hi>Heaven,</hi> because he was our <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, i. e.</hi> our <hi>Mediator</hi> of <hi>Redemption</hi> on <hi>Earth:</hi> If the Intercession which he makes for us be this, That God having covenanted with him to forgive us, if he would lay down his <hi>Life</hi> for us, our <hi>Saviour</hi> Christ having done this, do's therefore now, in Right of this <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> represent his Death and Passion to his <hi>Father</hi> for our <hi>Forgiveness</hi>; then it must follow, That as the <hi>Blessed</hi> VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIN has neither any <hi>Merits</hi> of this kind to plead, nor did <hi>God</hi> ever enter into any <hi>Covenant</hi> with her to accept of any thing she did in order to our <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> so neither has she any <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>intercede</hi> for us in <hi>Heaven,</hi> nor ought we therefore to <hi>pray</hi> to her so to do.</p>
               <p>It is I know a <hi>Distinction</hi> which some here make use of, when forced by the evidence of Truth to confess <hi>Christ</hi> to be our only <hi>Mediator,</hi> That there are two sorts of <hi>Mediators,</hi> one of <hi>Redemption,</hi> the other of <hi>Intercession:</hi> That <hi>Christ</hi> only is our <hi>Mediator</hi> of <hi>Redemption,</hi> and alone can plead a <hi>Right</hi> to our <hi>Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>; but that others, and especially the <hi>Virgin</hi> MARY is a <hi>Mediator</hi> of <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,</hi>
                  <pb n="498" facs="tcp:59924:258"/>
to implore <hi>God's Favour</hi> by humble <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Supplication</hi> for us. But besides that it is evident from what I have before observed, That this is not indeed all the Opinion they have of the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> as our Mediatrix, whom they allow to have <hi>Merits</hi> to plead as well as her Son, and to intercede by a proper Right and Title for us; this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction is wholly frivolous: Since as I have now shewn the very Foundation of Christ's interceding for us in <hi>Heaven,</hi> is founded on his <hi>Suffering</hi> for us upon <hi>Earth</hi>; and no one can <hi>appear in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God</hi> to ask our Pardon there, but he only who <hi>died</hi> and <hi>gave himself a Ransome</hi> for us here.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But secondly, this will appear more clearly, if we consider the Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy which the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> makes between the two <hi>Covenants,</hi> and compare the <hi>High-Priests interceding for the People under the Law, with our Saviour Christ's interceding for us in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> under the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Dispensation, that upon the <hi>great Day</hi> of <hi>Expiation</hi> the <hi>High-Priest</hi> should offer a <hi>propitiatory Sacrifice</hi>
                  <pb n="499" facs="tcp:59924:258"/>
for the Sins of the whole People: And then carry the Blood of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> into the most Holy Place, and present it before <hi>God,</hi> and so make an expiation for them. Now <hi>the Law having a shadow of good things to come,</hi> we are hereby taught to make this plain Application; That <hi>Christ,</hi> our <hi>High-Priest,</hi> having offered up himself as an <hi>Expiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> for the <hi>Sins</hi> of the whole World, is now <hi>ascended</hi> into <hi>Heaven,</hi> the most <hi>Holy Place,</hi> there to appear in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of <hi>God</hi> for us; and by presenting his <hi>Blood</hi> before the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> to make an <hi>Attonement</hi> for the Sins of all the true <hi>Israelites,</hi> who trust in it for their <hi>Forgiveness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as under the <hi>Law,</hi> no one was to appear in the Presence of God, but the <hi>High-Priest</hi> only, under Pain of Death, and he only once a Year, having first <hi>offered</hi> up the <hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi>; so now under the <hi>Gospel, Christ</hi> only <hi>appears</hi> in the <hi>Presence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> with his own <hi>Blood,</hi> to <hi>intercede</hi> for us; and 'tis through his <hi>Merits</hi> and <hi>Mediation alone,</hi> not through that of any other whatsoever in <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Earth,</hi> that we ought therefore to apply our selves to God for <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="500" facs="tcp:59924:259"/>But still the Distinction before made will recur upon us: For be it that <hi>Christ only</hi> has a Power to plead the <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of his <hi>Death</hi> for our <hi>Forgiveness</hi>; yet may not the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> and the <hi>Saints</hi> too pray for the same thing, and in this Respect be called our <hi>Advocates</hi> and <hi>Mediators?</hi> To this I answer, first; That what the <hi>Blessed VIRGIN</hi> and the other <hi>Saints</hi> may do, as to this Matter, is unknown to us: In general they may possibly <hi>pray</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> to endue us with his <hi>Grace,</hi> whereby we may <hi>repent</hi> and be <hi>saved</hi>; But then neither have we any Assurance that they do this, much less that they do it in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar for every single Person that calls upon them; neither if they did, would this entitule them to the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi> of <hi>Mediators,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so called, nor warrant us to <hi>pray</hi> to them as such. Secondly, much less would this be sufficient to engage us to put them in an <hi>equal Rank</hi> of <hi>Mediation</hi> with <hi>Christ himself:</hi> to joyn his <hi>Merits</hi> and theirs together; and <hi>pray</hi> to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that for our <hi>Saviour</hi> and the <hi>Virgin</hi>'s sake he would forgive us; which yet the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> most notoriously does. And besides, for
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:59924:259"/>
what concerns our present purpose, Thirdly, This is not all they allow to the <hi>Holy MARY,</hi> when they call upon her as their <hi>Advocate</hi>: No, they tell us plainly, as you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seen, that she obtains nothing of God but what she has <hi>merited</hi> for us, she having joyned her <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi> to those of <hi>Christ</hi> for the <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> and God having <hi>accepted</hi> of them for that End. And this I suppose I have sufficiently shewn to be utterly repugnant to the whole tenor of the <hi>New-Covenant,</hi> and to the <hi>Analogy</hi> which the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> it self has made between <hi>that</hi> and the <hi>Old.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us therefore go on, and enquire in the last place,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether there be any reason why we should give her those <hi>Titles,</hi> and ascribe to her such an <hi>Authority</hi> as in all their Solemn <hi>Addresses</hi> they allow to Her.</p>
               <p>And, <hi>First,</hi> For what concerns those <hi>Titles</hi> which they give her, we shall need no long search after them: The
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:59924:260"/>
                  <hi>Litany</hi> of the <hi>Blessed VIRGIN</hi> alone contains above <hi>forty</hi> of them, and scarce one of which can without a very <hi>favourable Construction</hi> be allowed to her. But indeed having form'd all their <hi>Devotion</hi> upon this <hi>Foundation,</hi> of turning the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> into an <hi>Earthly Court</hi>; having set up the <hi>Saints</hi> as <hi>Masters</hi> of <hi>Requests,</hi> to receive <hi>Addresses,</hi> and present them to <hi>God</hi> as <hi>King</hi>; it was but fit afterwards to keep up the <hi>Decorum,</hi> by raising the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> to the <hi>Dignity</hi> of <hi>QVEEN</hi> there; and then they ought not to address to her, without all the <hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> that became the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> to which they had raised her.</p>
               <p>Now 'tis to this <hi>Vanity</hi> we may ascribe the Eight last Compellations we meet with in her <hi>Litany</hi>; and by which she is set forth to us as <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, Confessors, Virgins,</hi> and all <hi>Saints</hi>: And in all which, if there be not some Excess, yet doubtless there is a great deal of Presumption, and of the vain leaven of <hi>Humane Folly</hi> and <hi>Ambition.</hi> To call upon <hi>God</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in a multiplicity of <hi>Attributes,</hi> which are neither pertinent to our

purpose, nor otherwise apt to raise those <hi>Affections</hi> in our <hi>Souls</hi> that are proper to the <hi>Holy Exercise</hi> we are about, is an argument of our Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Vanity, rather than an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a <hi>reasonable</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect. But to set up a <hi>poor, humble Woman</hi> in such a formal Pageantry of <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi>: To address to <hi>Saints</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> as if they valued the little <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Titles</hi> to which Men on Earth aspire, this is at best to shew a mind too much affected with the <hi>Vanities</hi> of this World; but to do it without all warrant from <hi>God,</hi> or so much as the least signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of his Pleasure in it, is, I think, too near a presumptuous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.</p>
               <p>But these are not the <hi>Titles</hi> that the most offend us: Others there are which we esteem by so much the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, by how much the more they encroach on the peculiar Attributes of <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Blessed Saviour.</hi> For indeed, to whom else can it belong to be esteemed the <hi>Help of Christians,</hi> the <hi>Comforter of the Afflicted,</hi> the <hi>Refuge of Sinners,</hi> the <hi>Gate of Heaven,</hi> the

               </p>
               <p>I will not deny but that it may be possible for those who have found out a way to reduce all the <hi>Prayers</hi> that are made to the <hi>Blessed VIRGIN</hi> to that one sense, <hi>Pray for us</hi>; to find out some convenient meaning for all these dangerous <hi>Titles</hi> too. But in the mean time, to what a desperate state, O God! must that <hi>Church</hi> be arrived; That those things should be a part of their Solemn Service, which cannot be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered without Impiety, nor be excused but by this shameful Pretence; that in their Publick Devotions, when one would think, if ever, they should take the Advice of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. v.2.</note> not <hi>to be rash with their mouths, nor hasty to utter any thing before God,</hi> even there they speak one thing and mean another; they speak little less than <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> but still with
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:59924:261"/>
a very pious and innocent meaning, and such as no body would suspect to be intended by their words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As for the other thing here to be considered, the <hi>Attributes</hi> which they ascribe to the <hi>Blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi> these are yet more dangerous than the worst of all their Compellations of her. Such are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their ascribing to her a Power not only of <hi>hearing</hi> their <hi>Prayers,</hi> but of <hi>dispensing</hi> also <hi>Blessings</hi> unto them:
<q>Let <hi>MARY</hi> and her <hi>SON bless</hi> us: Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, our Life, our Sweetness, and our Hope: To thee do we cry, poor ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd Sons of <hi>Eve</hi>: To thee do we send up our Sighs, mourning and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Valley of Tears. Turn then, most Gracious <hi>Advocate,</hi> thy merciful Eyes towards us; and after this our Exile ended, shew us the Blessed Fruit of thy Womb.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Of <hi>delivering</hi> them from <hi>danger.</hi> So in her Office;
<q>We fly to your <hi>Protection,</hi> O Holy <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> despise not our <hi>Prayers</hi> which we make

               <p>And if this be the case as to the <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>all</hi> that <hi>Service</hi> which these <hi>Votaries</hi> of the <hi>Blessed VIRGIN</hi> give her beyond us, it must then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follow, that their <hi>practice</hi> built upon it, can have no very good Establishment.

               <p>
                  <pb n="508" facs="tcp:59924:263"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In our <hi>Actions</hi> built upon these <hi>Opinions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now these may be reduced to Three <hi>general Points,</hi> correspondent to the Three <hi>Instances</hi> I before laid down, and upon which these <hi>Actions</hi> are founded; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>I. Of our not Praying to her.</item>
                     <item>II. Our not flying to her <hi>Merits</hi> and <hi>Intercession.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>III. Our not paying her those other <hi>Expressions</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> which those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> allow so profusely to her.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>For the first of these;</p>
               <p>Our not <hi>praying</hi> to the <hi>Blessed Virgin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have already said, That we look upon this to be a <hi>proper Act</hi> of <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> and such as does necessarily imply a Supposition of such <hi>Excellencies</hi> in her, as cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in any <hi>Created Being,</hi> how <hi>great</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> soever it may otherwise be.
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:59924:263"/>
And therefore that it ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served as solely due to that <hi>God</hi> who alone is <hi>infinite</hi> in <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>; and who alone, by being <hi>present every where,</hi> is every where fit to be called upon.</p>
               <p>And this I say, with reference to the very thing it self, without consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what kind of <hi>Prayers</hi> they are that are made to her. But now, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> Not only to <hi>call upon</hi> the <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed VIRGIN</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> for us, but that she would <hi>her self aid</hi> and <hi>assist us</hi>; and which 'tis evident, that in many, if not all the <hi>Prayers</hi> of her <hi>Office</hi> they do; this does yet more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the danger of such a <hi>Service,</hi> and yet more justifie our <hi>refusal</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>When therefore it shall be proved to us, either that we can with <hi>Faith call upon</hi> the <hi>Blessed VIRGIN,</hi> and yet not suppose that she is able either to <hi>hear</hi> our <hi>Prayers,</hi> or to <hi>answer</hi> our <hi>Desires</hi>; or that we can without Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety suppose that she can do either: When it can be shewed, that there is any manner of <hi>warrant</hi> in <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or so much as <hi>Encouragement</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> to Her; or that 'tis possible for any <hi>Benefit</hi> to accrue to us by so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:59924:264"/>
which we might not as certainly and readily <hi>obtain</hi> by going immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> through our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> In a word, when it can be made appear to us, either that <hi>Prayer</hi> is not a <hi>proper Act</hi> of <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> or that all such <hi>Acts</hi> are not reserved by our <hi>Holy Religion,</hi> as due to <hi>God only</hi>: Then will we be content that our <hi>Adversaries</hi> should accuse us as <hi>Enemies</hi> to the <hi>Holy MARY,</hi> for not joining with them in this <hi>Service.</hi> But till then this one Consideration shall be of more moment with us, than <hi>Ten thousand</hi> of their <hi>Anathema</hi>'s, That seeing to <hi>pray</hi> to any one, does imply the <hi>Person</hi> so called upon, to have such a <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Presence,</hi> as no <hi>finite, created Being,</hi> is, or can be capable of, we ought to give this <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> to that <hi>God only</hi> who <hi>alone</hi> is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi> in <hi>all these Perfections</hi>: Whom <hi>alone</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> sets forth to us as a <hi>God hearing Prayers,</hi> and <hi>searching</hi> the <hi>Heart</hi>; and therefore to whom alone, in all such <hi>Addresses, all Flesh</hi> must come.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="511" facs="tcp:59924:264"/>For the next thing proposed,</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>that we may obtain Mercy, and find Grace to help in time of need.</hi> And whilst this <hi>Saviour</hi> liveth continually to make <hi>Intercession</hi> for us, we cannot imagine either what <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Piety</hi> there can be in seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="512" facs="tcp:59924:265"/>If indeed these <hi>Votaries</hi> of the <hi>Blessed VIRGIN</hi> can prove to us, either that the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to joyn the <hi>Merits</hi> and <hi>Intercession</hi> of the <hi>Mother,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>For the last thing to be considered;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Those other Expressions of <hi>Worship</hi> which they allow to the <hi>Blessed VIRGIN.</hi>

               <p>They are both too <hi>many</hi> in <hi>number,</hi> and too <hi>considerable</hi> in their <hi>weight,</hi> to be particularly examined in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse; and the same <hi>Answer</hi> will serve for them all, That they are <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> either in <hi>themselves unlawful,</hi> or not fit to be paid to any but to <hi>God</hi> only.

                  </note> It is no small part of their respect to the <hi>Blessed VIRGIN,</hi>
                  <pb n="514" facs="tcp:59924:266"/>
to <hi>consecrate</hi> her <hi>Images,</hi> and set them up in their <hi>publick Places</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi>; to <hi>light</hi> up <hi>Candles,</hi> and <hi>burn Incense</hi> before them; to <hi>carry</hi> them forth in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,</hi> and go on <hi>Pilgrimages</hi> to them; and report strange <hi>Miracles</hi> that have been wrought by them. Now all these are <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> which the Word of <hi>God</hi> has expresly and utterly forbid, and which therefore we think it to be absolutely <hi>unlawful</hi> for any <hi>Christian</hi> to joyn in. <hi>God</hi> having plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he will not suffer any <hi>Image</hi> to be <hi>set up</hi> and <hi>honoured by us</hi>; nor hold them by any means innocent, that shall upon any account whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever presume so to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They <hi>burn Incense to her</hi>; They <hi>build Chappels,</hi> and <hi>Altars,</hi> and <hi>Oratories</hi> to her <hi>Service</hi>; they <hi>offer up</hi> the <hi>Mass,</hi> i. e. if they are in the right, the <hi>Body, Soul</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to her <hi>Veneration</hi>; They <hi>put themselves</hi> under her <hi>Protection</hi>; En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Congregations</hi> for her more <hi>particular Worship</hi>; They <hi>Vow</hi> themselves, and all they have, or hope to have, to her; They <hi>Swear</hi> by her
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:59924:266"/>
Name; They <hi>Pray, Confess, Absolve,</hi> in short, apply all the most solemn parts of their <hi>Devotion</hi> to her: And by all these, and many other Instances too long to be here particularly enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated, they give that <hi>Worship,</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> to the <hi>Holy VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIN,</hi> which the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> teaches us, and the <hi>Practice</hi> of the best and purest <hi>Ages</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> directs us to give to <hi>God only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if these things be indeed so as we suppose, and as I think I may presume to say I have in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure proved them to be; then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it cannot be wondered, if we refuse to give that <hi>Service</hi> to the <hi>Virgin MARY,</hi> which we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded belongs to <hi>God alone.</hi> But if we are mistaken in our <hi>Opinions,</hi> and that all this which I have here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, these <hi>Doctrines</hi> and these <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,</hi> be no more than what may be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to a <hi>meer Creature</hi>; let this be once evidently made out to us, and then they may with some <hi>colour</hi> of <hi>Justice</hi> pass that Censure upon us, which till then will be nothing but
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:59924:267"/>
an ungrounded Calumny; that for not doing such things as these, we are none of those of whom that <hi>Blessed VIRGIN</hi> prophesied in the <hi>Text,</hi>
                  <q>That behold from thenceforth all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations should call her Blessed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have now done with the several <hi>Points</hi> I proposed to speak to; and shall perhaps be thought by some to have insisted more than was necessary upon the discovery of these kind of <hi>Superstitions.</hi> But from this Suspicion I doubt not but you will soon clear me, if you will please only to go along with me in a few <hi>Reflections</hi> arising from what has been offered, and with which I shall <hi>close</hi> up this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>First</hi> is, of the great <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance</hi> of this Subject, upon many accounts to us.

had rather thus describe, than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> by its <hi>proper Name</hi> to you. And what the sad Consequence of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>as been, appears in this; That while they have thus laboured to set up the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> of the <hi>Blessed VIRGIN,</hi> they have but too much debased the <hi>Honour</hi> of our <hi>LORD</hi>; and lessened His <hi>Glory,</hi> to raise Hers.</p>
               <p>I need not say how much more <hi>Piety</hi> is shewn by many of that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> especially among the <hi>vulgar sort,</hi> to <hi>MARY,</hi> than to <hi>CHRIST</hi> himself. How many more particular <hi>Votaries</hi> she has, and how much more <hi>trust</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> is put in her <hi>Intercession,</hi> than in that of the <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed JESVS.</hi> I do not charge the whole <hi>Church of Rome</hi> as guilty of all this; but I must needs say I could heartily wish they were not all too much accessory to it. Whilst by such <hi>Principles</hi> and such <hi>Practices</hi> as these, they not only give occasion to the <hi>common sort</hi> to run into undue <hi>Excesses</hi>; but permit their more learned <hi>Guides</hi> even to encourage them in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="518" facs="tcp:59924:268"/>It is well known, how far Father <hi>Craesset</hi> abroad, and one of our own <hi>Countrymen</hi> nearer home, has but very lately revived the almost forgotten Excesses of former Ages. And when one of their own <hi>Communion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Widenfelt</hi>'s Advices of the <hi>Bl. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</hi>
                  </note> afraid, and indeed ashamed of these Abuses, put forth some <hi>Advices</hi> for the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of them, instead of encouraging the Admonition, all the Powers of the <hi>Church</hi> were thought too little to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm him, as if he had <hi>preach'd</hi> some <hi>new Gospel,</hi> or denied the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to be come in the Flesh.</p>
               <p>And now when this is the Case, I do not well see how they will be able to clear themselves altogether of those <hi>Follies,</hi> which they so readily encourage; and not only neglect to correct themselves, but will not suffer those who would, to do it.</p>
               <p>Nay, but we must not stop here: They have given a yet greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the dishonour of our <hi>Saviour</hi> than this. If we look into their <hi>Churches,</hi> and there view their <hi>Pictures,</hi> and their <hi>Images,</hi> those
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:59924:268"/>
                  <hi>Books of the Ignorant,</hi> as they are pleased to call them; what can be either more wretched in it self, or more apt to seduce unthinking <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,</hi> than every where to see <hi>Holy MARY</hi> with our <hi>Saviour</hi> still an <hi>Infant</hi> in her <hi>Arms</hi>; as if he were never to get out of the state of his Pupillage.</p>
               <p>And this were yet tolerable, if they thereby took care to call back their Minds to the condition of his <hi>Infancy</hi> once when on Earth. But alas! I must add, what exceeds all Extravagances besides, that they set him out still as a <hi>Child</hi> in <hi>Heaven.</hi> Nor is there any thing more common in the <hi>Lives</hi> of their <hi>Saints,</hi> in the Records of the <hi>Miracles</hi> of the <hi>VIRGIN,</hi> and even in their <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Devotion,</hi> than to hear of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> brought down in the <hi>Arms</hi> of his <hi>Mother,</hi> and still behaving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as a little <hi>Child</hi> towards her <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries.</hi> And what mean and low <hi>Opinions</hi> such things as these must needs <hi>create</hi> in <hi>Superstitious</hi> and <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant</hi> Minds of the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:59924:269"/>
                  <hi>World,</hi> is very natural to conceive; and the Devotion of the <hi>People</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Blessed VIRGIN,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with their <hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> towards the <hi>Holy JESVS,</hi> does but too <hi>fatally demonstrate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Consideration is not only thus <hi>important</hi> in it self, but of a more <hi>especial concern</hi> with regard to us.</p>
               <p>Were the <hi>Votaries</hi> of the <hi>Blessed VIRGIN</hi> content with a <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Opinion</hi> of her <hi>Excellencies</hi>; or would they be satisfied to pay her what <hi>Homage</hi> they thought fit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, without forcing others to joyn in it; this Matter, though very <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous</hi> to our <hi>Religion,</hi> yet would not so much concern our <hi>Practice.</hi> But now that the very <hi>Publick Devotion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is wholly over-run with this Abuse; so that 'tis impossible to <hi>pray</hi> to <hi>God</hi> with them, unless you will be content to <hi>pray</hi> to <hi>Holy MARY</hi> too: it was certainly very necessary for us to understand the danger of such an <hi>Error,</hi> which is
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:59924:269"/>
thus combined with the most <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>solemn Piety</hi> of a whole Body of <hi>Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This is a <hi>Point</hi> not only of very great moment in it self, and of a particular concern to us; but very plain too, and easie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</p>
               <p>In other things, though our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are strong to those that comprehend the force of them; yet many times the Subject is obscure, and the <hi>Disputation</hi> past the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the <hi>ordinary Christian.</hi> Thus in their <hi>Doctrines</hi> about the <hi>Church</hi>; the <hi>Authority, Vnity, Infallibility,</hi> and other either real or preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Privileges of it: The <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is <hi>nice,</hi> and easily perplexes an uninstructed Capacity. But here the Advice is evident, and the whole Subject easie: The only hardship is to bring them to own their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but afterwards the most <hi>Vulgar Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> is able to discern the falseness of it. Those first <hi>Rudiments</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, Thou shalt worship the Lord
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:59924:270"/>
thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve: How shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? There is one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus,</hi> and the like, being abundantly sufficient to shew how <hi>impossible</hi> it is that those should not have departed from their <hi>first Faith,</hi> who give <hi>Religious Honour</hi> to the <hi>Virgin MARY,</hi> and set her up as a <hi>Mediatrix</hi> in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this being once proved, it will from hence presently follow,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That all the <hi>Pretences</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> against us, are vain; and that we not only had sufficient Reason, but that it was our <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>reform,</hi> as we did from them.</p>
               <p>For to consider this <hi>Argument</hi> in one word. If the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> be <hi>actually</hi> and undoubtedly <hi>Erroneous</hi> in this <hi>Point,</hi> then let her fancy what she please, 'tis plain she can <hi>Err,</hi> and is not what she says, <hi>Infallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If she be not <hi>Infallible,</hi> then there
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:59924:270"/>
can be no Obligation to believe and follow her at all Adventures; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examining what she teaches, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we may examine her <hi>Doctrine,</hi> then the End of all <hi>Examination</hi> being to find out the <hi>Truth,</hi> and to cleave unto it; it must follow, that when upon the Enquiry, we had discovered her to be involved in grievous <hi>Errors,</hi> it was our Duty to <hi>abandon</hi> her <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and to <hi>declare</hi> against them.</p>
               <p>And thus this one <hi>Point</hi> alone being well cleared, does in the <hi>Consequence</hi> of it, plainly prove a <hi>Vindication</hi> of the whole Work of the <hi>Reformation</hi>; and is alone sufficient to satisfie any unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Mind, what just Cause we had for it.</p>
               <p>And let us then <hi>Bless God,</hi> who has opened our Eyes to discover such <hi>Abuses</hi> as these, and which had almost subverted the very chief <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Christianity.</hi> And let us as we ought, value nothing so much as that <hi>Purity</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> in which we have the happiness to exceed most <hi>Christians</hi> in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="524" facs="tcp:59924:271"/>Let our <hi>Adversaries,</hi> if they please, revile us; let them call us <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks, Despisers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Haters</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi>; let them fill <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> with their <hi>Anathema</hi>'s against us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we will not joyn with them in these and the like Abominations. But let us stand fast in the <hi>Lord,</hi> and in the <hi>Religion</hi> which we have <hi>received,</hi> knowing from whom we have <hi>received</hi> it, and what is the rule and measure of it: And that though, I do not say They or We, or any other <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Society</hi> of Men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; but though <hi>an Angel from Heaven,</hi> though St. <hi>Peter himself</hi> should come to us and <hi>preach</hi> any other <hi>Gospel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Galat. i.9.</note> 
                  <hi>he is to be accursed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall conclude all with those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent words of an Ancient <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> against some who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in his time to <hi>Honour</hi> the <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed VIRGIN,</hi> though not with any part of that excess that these Men now do; yet more than he supposed was fitting for them:
<q>
                     <hi>'Tis true</hi> (says he) <hi>MARY</hi> was <hi>Holy,</hi> but
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:59924:271"/>
she was not therefore <hi>God</hi>: She was a <hi>Virgin,</hi> and <hi>highly honoured,</hi> but she was not set forth to us to be <hi>worshipp'd:</hi> And therefore the <hi>Holy Gospel</hi> has herein arm'd us before hand; our <hi>Lord</hi> himself say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Woman, what have I to do with thee?</hi> Wherefore does he say this? But only left some should think of the <hi>Blessed VIRGIN</hi> more highly than they ought. He called her <hi>Woman,</hi> as it were foretelling those <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Heresies</hi> that should arise upon <hi>her account.</hi> But God permits us not to <hi>worship Angels</hi>; how much less the Daughter of <hi>Anna?</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Let <hi>MARY</hi> be held in <hi>Honour,</hi> but let the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> be <hi>Worshipped.</hi> Let no one <hi>Worship MARY</hi>; for though she were most <hi>fair,</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>honourable,</hi> yet she is not therefore to be <hi>adored.</hi> To conclude; Let <hi>MARY</hi> be held in <hi>Honour,</hi> but let <hi>God</hi> be <hi>Adored.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="526" facs="tcp:59924:272"/>Now to this <hi>God</hi> who alone has <hi>infinite Perfections,</hi> and is a <hi>God hearing Prayer</hi>; let us ascribe, as is most due, <hi>Salvation,</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Praise,</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> for <hi>ever</hi> and <hi>ever,</hi> Amen.</p>
