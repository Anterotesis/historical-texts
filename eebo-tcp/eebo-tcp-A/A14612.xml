            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE HONORABLE AND MOST RELIGIOVS KNIGHT SYR VVILLIAM STANLEY, One of the Maisters of his Catholique Maiestyes Army, and of his Counsell of Warre in the Low Countreys &amp;c. All Health and Happynes present, and in Eternity.</head>

            <p>IF I be accused of indiscretion for publishing this Treatise, which may seeme needles: yet I hope to be accounted either happy or prudent in finding so worthy a <hi>Patron</hi> to so simple an <hi>Orphan,</hi> which I destinated vnto your HONOVR, when you
<pb facs="tcp:28012:3"/>
were lately heere in this Courte of SPAINE, from whence I now send it to follow his good fortunes vnder the protection &amp; acceptance which then it pleased you to promise him. Also it comes vnto your HONOVR in a double duty, acknowledging both those Titles, for which commonly all Authors doo seeke <hi>Patrons</hi> vnto their Bookes: to wit, either for the manifest excellent <hi>Dignities</hi> of the Protectors, whose fauour is sufficient to giue them courage against malice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or els for certayn pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate <hi>Duties</hi> &amp; <hi>Respectes</hi> wherin the writer is obliged vnto his <hi>Patron</hi> to shew some thankfullnes.</p>
            <p>In both these <hi>Rightes</hi> I do heerin send nothing but your owne iust <hi>Due,</hi> and my humble <hi>Duty</hi>; intreating you by acceptance to giue life &amp; comforte both to this Booke, &amp; to the Author, who relyeth on your accustomed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, and among diuers others doth beare himselfe bold vpon your former Curtesyes. And surely he were extremely fearfull whosoeuer shoulde shew himselfe a Coward vnder the assurance &amp; protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of so <hi>Honorable,</hi> so <hi>Noble,</hi> so <hi>Valorous,</hi> so <hi>Ancient,</hi> so <hi>Religious,</hi> and so <hi>Expert</hi> a <hi>Comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der,</hi> as <hi>Syr William Stanley,</hi> whose name hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent renowne in all Christendome, and his memory will be famous to all posterity. All his vertues are so bright that I knowe no malice which dare barke against them: or if any slaunderers do reproache him, yet for him that saying of <hi>A. Gellius</hi> may be a sufficient defence: <hi>Numquam vir bonus veriùs laudatur, quàm cùm à malis vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuperatur.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:28012:3"/>
A good man is neuer more truly praysed, then when by euill men he is reproached; for indeed such mens wordes are no slaunders, and it is an euident signe of vertue to be maligned by the vicious.</p>
            <p>In Religion he is a <hi>Catholique,</hi> as his Ancestors haue bene: and herein so zealous, strict, and deuout, that some do well resemble him to the good <hi>Centurion</hi> (whose seruant our Sauiour healed) for his <hi>Humility, Faith, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi> and <hi>Gouernement.</hi> Others do accounte him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Cornelius,</hi> for his feruorous <hi>Prayers,</hi> many <hi>Almes-deedes,</hi> and continuall <hi>Hospitality.</hi> And besides all these, I do esteeme him a second <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathia,</hi> principally for his notable <hi>Deuotion</hi> vnto the most holy Sacrament of the <hi>Altar,</hi> which is the same Body of our Sauiour Christ taken downe from the Crosse, embalmed and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in the new sepulcher of our garden, when with a cleane, new, sweet conscience we receiue the blessed Communion, applying to our soules therby the merits of our Sauiours Passion, and embalming his most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious body with the odours of our good workes perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in his grace.</p>
            <p>Neither is he vnlike the same <hi>Ioseph</hi> in Honorable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or in Nobility of birth, being regarded for both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a principall man, not only amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his owne Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but euen among Strangers. As for the one, I call to witnesse the Ancyent and Present Noble Earles of <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> of which renowned Family he is a true <hi>Stanley,</hi> an
<pb facs="tcp:28012:4"/>
Honour to his Name, and the glory of his House. Next for the other, I appeale vnto the testimonyes of <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes, French, Dutch, Italians, Germans, Scottish, Irish</hi>; and euen to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> his Enemyes, who haue often seene or heard for certain the vndoubted tryal of his Prowesse: in so much that all sortes do no lesse acknowledge him <hi>Honourable</hi> for his Desertes, then for his Dignityes, as a man worthy of high place in Commaund and Counsell. <hi>Noble</hi> in his Nature, besides his birth: <hi>Valourous</hi> in the Feild, or at a Fort: in defending like a stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Sheild, &amp; like a sharp Sword in assaulting; and so in both like <hi>Fabius</hi> &amp; <hi>Marcellus</hi> conjoyned, wherof the one was called the <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> and the other the <hi>Sword</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> against <hi>Hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And furthermore in all these so happy, that he hath liued to be <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>Ancyent</hi> in yeares, hauing passed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perills; and so blessed of Allmighty God, whom he hath serued with such Deuotion, that he neuer yet tooke any foyle, or suffred disgrace whersoeuer he had any Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde: and Time was, when if his Counsell had bene followed, the Enemy had bene more fully defeated, or vtterly ruyned.</p>
            <p>Wherfore lastly I may conclude, that he is an <hi>Experte Warriour,</hi> because he is so Ancyent in his art, and so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in his successe, wherin although fortune many times for our sinnes do fayle the <hi>Valiant</hi>; yet neuer did any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheiue a lucky enterprise who was not also Prudent. And
<pb facs="tcp:28012:4"/>
so I affirme his <hi>Merites</hi> and his <hi>Memory</hi> to be so notable, and so durable, that as of <hi>Cato</hi> it was sayd, <hi>He shall need no Statua, nor any Graue-stone, wherin to continue or engraue his Heroycall Name</hi>; but rather if he should want any such Monument or other rewarde, as of the same <hi>Cato,</hi> so of him it will better be said. <hi>Why hath Memorable Stanley so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, when others haue so much?</hi> For it is a more glorious fame to haue had excellent great merites with a small monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; then to haue exceeding rich Tropheys for some poore desertes.</p>
            <p>And these thinges, HONOVRABLE SYR, I haue spoken in a third person of you, rather then vnto you; as in your absence, not before your face: because I knowe you loue not to heare your owne prayses, how <hi>True, Iust,</hi> or <hi>Due</hi> soeuer they be: &amp; yet because they are your <hi>Due, Iust, &amp; True</hi> Ensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes of Honour, according to the custome of most E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles Dedicatory, I am bound to display them in the forefront of this Bookes array: for the encouragement of freindes, for the terror of foes, because the Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Vertues</hi> of the <hi>Patron</hi> are the comfort &amp; safegarde of the <hi>Suppliant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherfore I humbly beseech you to haue patience for these intentes to endure the rude rehearsall of your prayses, wherso you may take these deformed lineamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, rather for a mortification then any commendation, by viewing your glorious colours blotted by my pen,
<pb facs="tcp:28012:5"/>
which otherwise are sufficient to frame a most comely picture by the hand of skill. But I intreate you to pardon my playne boldnes; to accept my willing seruice; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayn these paper leaues into your Patronage; to fauour them your selfe; to further them with others; and if by them any good redound to any soules, my desire is that God may haue the glory, &amp; you the thankes, and that I may sometime be remembred in your deuout prayers: assuring your <hi>Honour</hi> (as I am bound) neuer to omit you in my poore supplications. And so I beseech our Lord Iesus to keep you, and all yours, for his owne precious merites, and by the intercession of our blessed Lady, and of all holy Sayntes, and in particuler of <hi>S.

Penitentialls, and to publish them all at once: but hauing bene hitherto only able to finish the firste 4. of them, partly for wante of firme health, partly by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of more necessary busynes, and furthermore perceuing the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume would be greater then I supposed, and laste of all because I am now called away to another kinde of treatise: therfore I thought it good in the meane while to publish what I had finished vpon the psalme Miserere: as one desirous first to wash away the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my particuler sinne, before I would come to handle the pure mysteryes of our Catholique doctrine.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And so our worthy Countryman Cardinall Poole vsed to say, that one cause of so much heresy in these latter times was in too bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy disputing about our faith, before we tooke any care to reforme our life: wherfore he wished all them who were ready to read S. Pauls Epistles, to beginne firste to read, &amp; to practise their latter chapters, which are euer morally teaching vertues before they enter into disputes about their former Chapters, which for the most part
<pb facs="tcp:28012:6"/>
are doctrinall about matters of knowledge: for it is vnlike they will be freed from peruerse errors, who do continue their liues in obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate vices: such men may talke of opinions in religion; but seldome shall you see any fruites of their religion, more then opinion and table-talke.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Some desire to know only because they would be able to talke or discourse: &amp; this is vanity. Some delight in knowing how to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course or talke, because they desire to be knowne: and this is vayne glory. Some labour to knowe much, because knowledge hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighte, not intending therby any other fruite of their labour: and this is curiosity. Only their knowledge sauours of christian piety whose intention is therby to serue God, and to profit men, first sauing their owne soules, and next to helpe others according to their ability.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And surely, as our knowledge wanteth wisdome when we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect others to euerlasting happynes, suffering our selues to be lead vnto eternall misery, for especially in regard of our soules, <hi>ist hoc est sapere, sibi sapere,</hi> this is wisdome, to be wise for our selues; so yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was any thus wise in his knowledge, who firste did not learne humility with his wisdome: For as naturally knowledge doth puffe vp in pride, so spiritually we must endeuour to keep it vnder and in good order by humility. Or indeed it is but humane wisdome, &amp; knowledge of thinges without vs which maketh vs swell in our opinion of knowledge; wheras if we woulde by the light of diuine wisdome view the defectes and faultes of our owne inward bosome and looke vpward with reuerence to the high Majesty of God himselfe, <hi>then</hi> would our wisdome be profitable to our selues as well as to others; and <hi>then</hi> will our knowledge increase our humility.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Wherfore S. Thomas of Aquine speaking of Humility, saith,<note place="margin">2.2. <hi>q.</hi> 161.</note> it is a vertue which maketh a man willing to submitte himselfe vnto God for God, and vnto man for the same God; and that this humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is founded vpon the knowledge of God, and of our selues, viz: of our nothing, and his infinite incomprehensibility; of our basenes
<pb facs="tcp:28012:7"/>
and his majesty; of our pouerty and his Riches; of our weakenes &amp; his omnipotency; of our ignorance and his wisdome. And therfore an humble man doth renounce himselfe acknowledging his owne faultes and imperfections, and with reuerent confidence trusteth in our Lordes Goodnes. And thus if we empty our owne vessells of windy pride and putrifyed sinne, doubtles our Lord will fill them as the widowes vessell with his oyle of grace; for if Achab was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned who was but feignedly humbled,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 27. <hi>Luc.</hi> 7.</note> how much shall we haue forgiuenes with S. Mary Magdalen, if with syncere humility we lye weeping and prostrate at our Sauiours feet?</p>
            <p n="8">8. Such must be our humility: and then will our knowledge be practicall as well as speculatiue, and benefiting our selues as much as others; wheras betwene speculation and practise there is as much difference as betwene studying the nature of gold, and possessing the substance of gold. It is true, both are good; yet shoulde they not be separated; no more then our vnderstanding from our will. For practicall knowledge doth mooue and order the <hi>will:</hi> but spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation only doth informe the <hi>vnderstanding.</hi>

Paul by practicall instructions euen after he had seene a great light in the waye; for still he remayned blind in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Ananias practicall experience. For speculatiue knowledge alone is but as the lighte of the moone which shyneth feebly; but this knowledge made practicall is glorious as the sunne, which hath both heate and brightnes; by heate to giue vs motion, &amp; with his brightnes to shew vs light how to walke, and to lead a good christian life: and vnto both these together, we may referre that of Dauid,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:28012:7"/>
thus: <hi>I haue wandred, O God, seeking thee without, who wert within.</hi> And so doo all men wander out of themselues, when euery one particulerly doth not consider his owne inwarde estate of soule what and who he is? by whom created? and to what end? for want of which serious considerations not marking our sinnes nor our misery, we seeke not our remedy: but as S. Gregory said, like foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish trauellers passing through a short pleasing meddowe, we doo so much fasten our eyes vpon some fayre seeming flowres, that we fall into some ditch, or take some wrong way leading to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p n="10">10. For as the cause of all the prodigall childes misery came by departing out of his Fathers house (and then out of himselfe) into a farre country; so his remedy beganne, as the gospell saith, <hi>In se au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem reuersus,</hi> when he returned into himselfe, and to the knowledge of his miserable estate, and of his vile courses; wherfore meditating on the End wherto he was like to come by sinne, he said, <hi>Ego autem hic fame pereo: reuertar in domum patris mei:</hi> here I doo perish by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: I will returne into the house of my Father. And so must we all reflecte vpon our selues, learning to knowe who God is? and what we are? pondering the abhomination of our sinnes passed, the dread and feare of our conscience present, and the horrible terror of iudgement and punishment to come. O thus let vs often imitate Dauid saying, <hi>Meditatus sum nocte cum corde meo, exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar, &amp; scopebam spiritum meum.</hi> I haue meditated in the night with mine owne harte, I was exercised, and I did sweepe my spirite. O thus let vs sweepe and clense our soules by meditation and practicall knowledge of our owne hartes! in examining our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; trying our faith; &amp; heedfull looking to our workes! then shall we see our Errors and our faultes; then will we chuse a better course for our saluation; then shall we exercise our selues in deedes of penance, in Actes of contrition; in syncere confessions; in due satisfactions; and in diuerse kinds of voluntary and deuout morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.</p>

In our inward senses and appetites irascible, concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, imagination, and selfe will. In our reasonable vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, memory, and free will. In all these we haue rendred our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues as slaues into the Diuells bondage, whiles we suffer sinne to reigne and haue dominion in vs, so that our vnderstanding is obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, our will is depraued, and our memory is blotted with much euill: we haue our irascible power full of impatience and anger, and the concupiscible inflamed with brutish affections and carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes; our Imagination is turmoyled with worldly desires and vayne suspitions; our selfewill is crookened &amp; hardened by obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: all the partes and outward senses of our bodyes are become the members and instrumentes of sinne: and so we passe from vice to vice, and euery day we intangle our selues in new iniquityes, and in more chaynes, by which the Diuell leades vs along to his eternall prison of tormentes, whiles we yeild our selues to committe or to continue any mortall sinne, without contrition and true care of amendment.</p>
            <p n="12">12. It is true: we are not able by our selues alone to get out of the Diuells slauery, to forsake sinne, nor to alter and amend entirely the course of our liues: for hauing once yeilded and liued in the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome and subiection of sinne and Satan, we haue need of Allmigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Gods helpe and grace to deliuer vs; first preuenting and stirring vs vp to haue a good will,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Tho.</hi> 1.2. <hi>q.</hi> 109. <hi>a.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. <hi>Concil. Trid.

creatures; &amp; <hi>freely</hi> consenting or dissenting to all good motions; yet as allmighty God doth first inspire them, so further without his grace we are no way able to effect them; for in religious spirituall good thinges without him we can do nothing.</p>
            <p n="13">13. But on the other side we haue greater and assured comfortes: First because our Lorde doth offer grace vnto all men at one time or other by giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good desires of a better life; by which he would haue all men to be saued. If they euer refuse these good morio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, then are they iustly forsaken &amp; left in a reprobate sense. If we doo at any time admitte these good desires, &amp; so do but as much as lyes in our power, then most infallibly our Lord doth giue vs further grace &amp; meanes wherby to come to the knowledge of his truth. Of the first preuenting inspirations, Gods wisdome saith, <hi>Beholde I stande at the dore &amp; knocke:</hi> if we open not, but keepe him out it is our fault: if on our partes we yeild him entrance, then alltogeather with the Father and the Sonne they will come vnto vs by operating grace effecting our full resolution; and by further grace still cooperating they will dwell with vs in practise &amp; continuance of a vertuous holy life, till the accomplishment of our saluation, if we of our selues doo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer driue him from vs agayne, by committing some mortall sinne.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Our second comforte is, that as if we let him into vs when he knocketh by preuenting grace admonishing our hartes; so by his operating &amp; following grace, when we are resolued, if we do but knocke by prayer at his doore of mercy, he doth euer most vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly receiue vs into fauour. O most gracious God full of mercy who doth call vnto vs by grace, that we should call vnto him for mercy? can any creature wish for greater clemency then to haue forgiuenes for the asking? And is he not worthy to perish in his wickednes, who will neither admit good desires, nor be mooued vnto harty prayers? O what will mooue vs, if consideration of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall perdition cannot stirre vs? Or if we doo not pray for mercy, because we doo not consider our misery? Agayne, and agayne, I beseech you to examine your Religion, to try your faithe, and to
<pb facs="tcp:28012:9"/>
take an vnpartiall view of your whole life, that seing your danger, you may seeke for fauour; for as in the Spanish Prouerb it is truly said of our corporall eyes, <hi>Quienbien vee, bien llora</hi>: He that sees clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, weepes easily; so in the eye sight of our soule, he that clearely beholdes his faultes, will more easily shed teares for his pardon.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Let vs examine our selues by the 10. Commandements of God, by the 5. Preceptes of his Church: by the 7. workes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy corporall, and 7. spirituall: by the 7. deadly sinnes: or by some, or by all of these, according to our abilitye, particuler obligations, or other degrees, which doo bind vs often not to omit that which is Good, and doo forbid vs neuer to commit that which is ill. Let vs consider by what meanes our Lord hath sought to bring vs to the knowledge of his truth, and to become members of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church; infusing good illuminations into our vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or good desires into our will, inuiting vs to vertue or truthe, disswading vs from vice or error, eyther by good examples, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous bookes, by holy preistes, or by our friendes, yea sometime by our enemyes whom we hate, or by them whom we doo persecute; for either all, or some of these shalbe witnesses against vs, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecte their meanes, or doo willfully loose the time of fauour. Or if we doo admit these good beginninges, yet we must proceed with care and cherfullnes to imploy our time meritoriously, andto reape benefite by the exercise of our Religion, by the sacramentes of the Catholique Churche, and by all the Goodnes of God directed to his greater glory and our saluation, eyther in his giftes of grace, arte, or nature; whether it be in diuine contemplation, or in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Action; spirituall meditating of his diuine mysteryes, or vsing of his creatures orderly for his seruice, and for our necessitye. O ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable happynes of religious or discreet holy men, who doo thus order theyr liues! O lamentable wilfullnes of obstinate or proud people, who doo refuse to saue their soules! O detestable vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes of wicked or careles creatures, who doo neglecte or abuse so many helpes! The tractable, diligent, and humble seruant shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be

exalted vnto eternall glory, when the peruerse, carelesse, and high-minded Despiser shall be throwne downe into euerlasting torment.</p>
            <p n="16">16. And therfore to auoyde the one, and obtayne the other, let vs betake our selues to penitent Prayer; with humility on our partes, considering our vncertaine faith, and our certayn faultes; and yet in regard of our most gracious God, with comfort and confidence, respecting his great mercy and infinite kindnes; to hope &amp; trust in him as a pittifull louing Father, and yet to be humble and reuerent towardes him, as a King of high Majesty: For so our Sauiour taught vs to prepare our thoughtes to the petitions of his prayer, by saying for an introduction, <hi>Our father which art in heauen:</hi> that because he is <hi>Our father,</hi> therfore we should be assured to find fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour; and yet not to be presumptuous, or heedles, because he sittes on a high throne of justice <hi>in heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. Thus let vs pray with Dauid in repeating or perusing this psalme of <hi>Miserere,</hi> not alone, because the exercise of prayer is both meritorious as a good worke, and allso impetratorious as a deuout petition: but furthermore because it is an Acte of Gods worship expressely commaunded in those wordes, <hi>Petite &amp; accipietis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>quaerite &amp;c</hi>: Aske and you shall receiue: Seeke and you shall finde: knock and it shall be opened vnto you. Which wordes S. Thomas and other Doctors do affirme to haue the nature of Preceptes, binding vs to pray, and annexeth promises assuring vs to preuayle; for we shall receiue, finde, and haue it opened; if we aske in hart and thought; seeke with our mouth and wordes; and knocke with our hands and workes: eyther by all these, or at least by the first, when we cannot performe the rest.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Or if Prayer were not absolutely commaunded, yet our necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes &amp; danger do require it, as S. Gregory said, <hi>The euills which do heere oppresse vs, do compell vs to flye vnto God</hi>: as the prodigall sonne feeling famine, he desired to satisfye his hunger, <hi>Et nemo illi dabat,</hi> and no body gaue him where withall; For nothing in this worlde

And lastly he flyeh to this submission of prayer, as to his cheife refuge, <hi>Dicam Patri,</hi> I will say vnto my Father, I will make my moane vnto him: he is my Father, and therfore I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my want and supplication vnto him: <hi>Quid enim nisi vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta supersunt?</hi> For a sinfull wretch hath no better meanes left, then by prayer to beginne his conuersion, and to begge his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, according to that of Iob: <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if with syncere contrition of our hart we be greiued for our sinnes, because for them we haue lost the loue of God; and if we pray humbly for their remission, with purpose to confesse them as well as we can; and do intend neuer agayne willfully to commit them; vndoubtedly this purpose and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conuersion on earth, shall obteyne most certayn and ioyfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation in heauen: for our Lord IESVS hath said vnto his Preistes (and he is most true of all his wordes) Whose sinnes on earth you remitte, in heauen they shalbe remitted; why then should we not seeke to disburden our heauy consciences vnto some Ghostly Father, that we may through his Authority (granted by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour) so receiue his heauenly Absolution, his ghostly comfort, &amp; his spirituall direction; in all these submitting our selues vnto our Confessor, not as to a Man, but as to the Deputy of our Lord IESVS, and to the Pastour of our soules: and then in all true amendment, endeauouring as we can, to performe our penance or other satisfaction. Beleeue me, o Sinners (amongst whom I haue bene a Ring-leader) by experience I say, beleeue me, it is a most comfortable and wonderfull experience; For your selues shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently feele comfort in your soules; and with continuance of time others allso will perceiue amendment in your liues.</p>
            <p n="21">21. To conclude therfore, as in generall I would perswade you to practise the examination of your consciences, and the exercise of deuout prayer, directing vs all vnto Contrition, Confession, and Satisfaction; so I do commend as helpes for these purposes, a serious accompt how we spend our liues; an indifferent obseruation why &amp; vpon what occasions these new-found sclanderous opinions did banish the Catholique religion of our Auncestors, wherin full ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a hundred yeares togeather they serued God so deuoutly, and so hartily loued their neighbours; and for the same purpose I intreat a view and a detestation of our former sinnes; and auoydance of their occasions; an endeauour to practise their contrary vertues;
<pb facs="tcp:28012:11"/>
sometime by reading of good bookes; sometime by deuout medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or prayers; sometime by almes deedes, or fasting, abstinence, or other bodily chastisement; sometime by humbling our though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes; alwayes by mortifying our passions, and vnlawfull affections; and alwayes being carefull to keep the commandements of God our Father, and of our Mother the Church. And to bringe these good purposes and cogitations into our mindes the oftener, and to mooue and imprint them the better, it is good for vs sometime to giue an edge, and to whet on ech other, by vertuous or spirituall talke and conference; not contending in disputes, but by modest teaching, or by freindly encouragements, and aboue all by frequenting the most holy sacrifice and sacrament of our deare Sauiours most precious Body and Bloud: by often calling to memory some exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his life; and more in particuler his bitter passages vnto death; both for our meditation, and for our imitation; so to giue good example one vnto another, whiles all are labouring to follow Christ our cheife Maister. And to this end it is allso good to reuiue our deuotion by reading or hearing of Sayntes liues; or by the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent beholding of their deuout Images or paynted storyes, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the passion of our sweet Sauiour IESVS; by marking his sufferinges, to be mooued for our owne sinnes: and so by viewing the memory of other Saintes, to be stirred vp to follow their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as they were followers of Christ: for we may learne, and are mooued by our eye sometime as much or more then by our eare; and in these thinges which are so good, and wherein we are so dull, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily euen common sense doth teach vs, that it is profitable and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to stirre vp our memory &amp; deuotion by any sense; and by how much the more, by so much the better.</p>
            <p n="22">22. And yet further vnto them that be sufficiently able, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the reading and meditation of Dauids Psalter, which holy Church vseth so much in all her diuine Offices; and particulerly of the seauen Penitentiall Psalmes; and according to the practise of Catholiques, especially of this psalme <hi>Miserere</hi>: as admonished

As for his soule who aduentureth to committe such thinges as these, because Dauid so offended, he is much more wicked, and sinneth more abominably then Dauid: he sinned of concupiscence, &amp; thou of malice.</hi> Let vs rather, imitate his holynes, not followe his wickednes: shoulde we fall with him, O my soule, and not ryse with him; shoulde we loue that in Dauid which he hated in himselfe? Doost thou looke vpon the booke of God to embolden thy selfe to sinne against God? Doost thou note one error in an excellent picture, and learne to paynte that blemish rather then all his other comely portraiture? wilte thou learne sophistry, to forsake logique? wilt thou read <hi>Index expurgatorius,</hi> to professe all the doubtes &amp; falsehoods which it mentions to be amended, &amp; not to be mainteyned? then feed as well vpon the garbage of fowles, &amp; vpon the gall of beastes, &amp; cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their carkasses.</p>

Dauid after a full dinner and an easie sleep, fittes idle in his prospecte, and takes delighte to feed his eye with gazing about: there his ranging idle lookes were as a quicke spye to marke a beautifull woman: his harte streighte desired to enioye what he sawe; &amp; his will procured to obteyne what he affected. While Saul persecuted him,

and he lurked in caues, he neither minded such matters, nor admitted such occasions; but now he becomes remisse &amp; wanton in the prosperity of his kingdome: now he is at leysure to espye Bersabee a farre off (so quick-sighted is concupisc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ierom said; <hi>A Full belly doth easely froathe vnto luste</hi>; so especially if you adde vnnecessary sleepe vnto intemperat dyet, it makes a double payre of bellowes to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the fyre of incontinence: the one is the flynte stone; and the other is the steele; &amp; both together strike out sparkes of carnall desyres, which yet may be extinguished, if you adde not a ranging eye as the tynder; vnwary curious lookes will sodenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traye our vnsetled harte; for if by this gazing view, so stayed a man as Dauid lost him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, we haue much more need like Iob to make a couenant with our eyes, not to looke vpon a woman. Wherfore let vs be no gazers at dores, windowes, or galleryes; no gapers in the streetes, no gadders vp and downe markets, in fayres no giggelets, no puritan rolling eyes in churches, nor vse a wanton looke in any place, least as from a basiliske we receiue poison by the eye, which will infecte the harte.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Dauid by looking on Bersabee in her bathe, was more inflamed by the beauty of the woman, then he was cooled by the water of the founteyn: and they that pretend only to obserue the diuersityes of features, &amp; the excellencyes of complexions, shall sooner be drawen to fleshly imaginations, then to philosophicall or spiritual consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.

Spartianus related how one coming out of a dangerous bathe, and harde by seing a number of painted tables hanged on the wall of a temple after the Roman custome, and supposing they had bene all in memorye of their perills escaped in that bathe, he said, <hi>I wonder there be no more tables,</hi> for he dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that euery man was bound to haue offred a table, who bathing there had escaped such a danger; so in truthe, whosoeuer vseth to gaze on women or to conuerse with them and is not intangled, surely he is obliged to hang vp a table of a memorable es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape. And therfore as in all sinnes, so perticulerly in this our english prouerbe hath good place, <hi>he that will no euill doo, must avoyde all thinges which long thertoo</hi>: Let vs beware of all amourous wordes, wanton lookes, lighte gestures, lasciuious behauior, immodest attyre, and aboue all flye familiar opportunity and occasion; for as occasion (we say) makes a theefe, so it often makes a harlotte. And S. Bernard affirmed, that <hi>to liue among women familiarly, and no way to be defiled by women, is a miracle aboue the power of men: it is more easy to rayse the dead, then in continuall occasions, so to mortifye the liuing</hi>: If thou canst not doo the lesser, how darest thou hazarde the greater? especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally seing among all sinnes, this is perticulerly called, the sinne of Frayltye, to note herein our greatest weakenes.

Also Iudges many times condemne small faultes in others that stande at the barre, and will not obserue much iniustice &amp; great crimes in themselues, in their followers, and in some that sitte on the benche: euen as Dauid here woulde haue him dye that tooke the lambe; but he marked not his owne crime, who had defiled a matrone, and slayne a man. As a certain Pirate answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Alexander: <hi>that is called in a king, honorable &amp; lawfull victory, which is condemned in me for vnlawfull &amp; base piracy.</hi> With such partiality we easily abhorre wickednes in others; and yet by such our owne censures (if we amend not) allmighty God will make vs condemne our selues by our owne mouthes, according to that of our blessed Lady: <hi>He hath dispersed the proud, in the minde of his owne harte:</hi> and so doubtles he will iudge many offendors by the sentence of their owne wordes.

               <p n="5">5. Otherwise matrimony being an office of nature, and a Sacrament of the churche, the due accomplishment therof is not a sinne: for as it is <hi>naturall,</hi> it intendeth <hi>prolem</hi> to haue children: and it keepeth <hi>fidem</hi> obseruing the faithfull title and promise giuen of eche to others body: Beside which, among Catholique Christians this Sacrament giueth grace; and betokens the loue and vnion betwene Christe and his churche.</p>

in obseruing true loue &amp; loyalty, and in yeilding mutuall dutyes &amp; assistance ech to other: and so for performance of all these perteyning both to progeny and fidelity is required vsuall cohabitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, excepte when some vrgent or greater cause doo neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily enforce any absence. The third, which is the sacrament (if the partyes hinder it not by indisposition) giueth grace of vnion, when the contracte is lawfully made by expresse wordes of the present, or by apparent signes of consent; by which grace their mindes are extraordinarily knit &amp; vnited in honest and discrete loue. And as our Sauiour Christes loue to his churche is inseparable, so the sacramentality of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage grounded herevpon, causeth this bond of mariage <hi>Among Christians</hi> to be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuisible, that thoughe in some cases they may be separated from bed and boarde, or from cohabitation; yet the mariage <hi>at the firste,</hi> or afterwardes hauing bene <hi>once law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> they can neuer be so disioyned, that either parte may mary agayne whiles the other doth liue.</p>

Because, they say, Adam alone as a <hi>publique person</hi> and <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall father</hi> of all mankind, did represent the persons of all his successors; and for them as well as for himselfe did receiue originall iustice, by the losse wherof he broughte vs all (as being partes of him as our natural head) into this detriment of originall sinne. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the same respecte allso, thoughe Cayn or any other sinner had first sinned, Adam being still vprighte, yet their sinne should only haue deformed themselues, and not haue perteyned to vs: because we are comprehended in none as our generall father saue only in Adam.</p>

Sinne, say they hath his seate in the soule, not in the flesh: But the soule is created, &amp; not deriued from Adam, nor our parents; therfore neither is this originall sinne deriued from the one, or from the other by generation, but foloweth by imitation.</p>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Next,</hi> about the proposition. As all deuines agree that the soule is the seate of sinne; so yet if the soule may herin be depraued by the flesh, as some thinke, then may originall sinne be transfused into the soule by generation of the body. These men say the flesh must needes be the meanes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueying this sinne vnto the soule as vnto his seate: for if the soule should be created alone, and not be ioyned to the body, it should in that case be free from this infection. And it seemes iuste, that as Adams flesh was firste corrupted by his soule which firste admitted sinne; so now the soule shoulde be firste corrupted by the flesh still deriuing sinne: and so originall sinne, is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:28012:31"/>
both a corruption of penality subiecting vs to all misery: and a corruption of vicio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity inclyning vs to all sinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. by rebellion against the spirite, 2. by drawing the soule downeward. 3. because the soule of it selfe is not able to gouerne all our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites without diuine grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thus therfore, say they, that the flesh doth depraue the soule, <hi>being vnited vnto it,</hi> as a wounde in the body maketh the soule grieue; but if you cutte the flesh wanting life, it feeles no payne: So the flesh hath not sinne in it selfe as in his seate, no more then wyne hath in it selfe dronkennes, and yet maketh others dronke: and so the body is able to infecte, &amp; to worke vpon the soule. 1. not by predominance, as one eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or mixte body vpon another. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor by influence, as the heauens vpon these inferior bodyes. 3. nor by deuine power, as the fyre vpon dammed spirites but. 4. by Sympathy of vnited correspondence, as in a phrensy, or lunacy, such a distemper or quality of the body makes the minde to be madde or foolish. And so the corrupte distemper of our flesh doth disorder our soule whit sinfullnes: which sinfull diste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is not actually but dispositiuely in the seede of the parent, or flesh of the infante: nor is it in the flesh vntill it come to be ioyned to the soule, which is only the full &amp; finall seate of sinne.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And note that all this may be true, in respecte of that radicall concupiscence, which is as it were the positiue materiall parte of originall sinne:<note place="margin">

               <p n="7">7. And so lastly, it is answered to the Pelagians assumption, and inference<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Vidz</hi>: The soule is not deriued from Adam; nor therfore originall sinne which is in the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le. That originall sinne in the soule, is not considered to belong thervnto; whither we falsely suppose the soule to be traduced from Adam, or whither we beleeue it truly to be created of God; but only in respecte that the soule being ioyned to the body, <hi>then</hi> makes a complete creature, who is a parte or member of Adam, and so only capable &amp; subiect to this originall sinne. Allso furthermore consider: that to the end that sinne should be deriued from Adam, it is not necessary that the soule allso be deriued from him: but it is enoughe if the complete reasonable creature (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the soule is a parte) be in descent a member of Adam. And obserue: that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is not finished in the production of the forme or soule alone, nor of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or body alone, but in the complete coniunction &amp; vnion of both together: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he may be said to be the next cause of generation, who is the next cause of this coniunction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But our parentes doo so dispose &amp; affoarde the materiall parte, which is the seede or body, that the soule which is the forme, must in order of nature ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily followe &amp; come to be conioyned thervnto: in which sense, a man is said to beget a man, and so thoughe he be not Author of the soule, yet he is called father of the whole creature, because he is in nature the next cause of this vnion &amp; coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the soule with the body. Thus therfore I conclude, that we deriue origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sinne from Adam only, as being our generarll father alone; for thoughe our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther auncestors &amp; parents be the instrumentall causes or as conduytes the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. BVT the principall difference is, that Moyses lawe did not iustifye <hi>ex opere o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perato</hi> nor did the sacrifices &amp; ceremonyes therof conteyne grace in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:<note place="margin">S. <hi>Tho.</hi> 1.2. <hi>q.</hi> 103. <hi>art.</hi> 2. <hi>Et</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 62. <hi>art.</hi> 4.5.6. <hi>Et Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jet. ibid.</hi>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, they could not really conteyne vertue of that which yet was not: only <hi>ex o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere operantis</hi> if the partyes offering were in state of grace, &amp; had faith in the expected Messias, then did those sacrifices iustifye; not as conferring grace of themselues cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally, but only as signes accidentally. It is true; the sacramentes of our lawe in like sorte require faith &amp; deuotion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but moreouer in themselues they are more then sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and doo conteyne &amp; confer grace: not corporally abiding in them, for so can nothing meerely spirituall be conteyned in a bodily substance: But instrumentally &amp; really remayning in them, and so virtually intended to passe &amp; be conueyed by them. For our sacraments effect grace cheifly as instrumentall causes, and that, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentes mediate &amp; separate, such as is a staffe, not as an instrument coniuncte &amp; immediate, such as a hande. And so the principall efficient cause of grace is God himselfe: the humanity of our Sauiour Christe as an instrument coniuncte: and as separate instrumentes and causes of grace, are our sacramentes; both satisfactions for sinne, and meritorious of fauour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wherfore thoughe the sacrifices of the olde lawe iustifyed as signes testifying the faith &amp; obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the offerer, yet this was only <hi>ex opere oper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. And thus is the lawe of Christe more perfect &amp; more abundant in grace, then was the law of Moyses: for what the Leuiticall law did but promise &amp; signifye, our Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelicall law doth exhite &amp; performe: &amp; as S.

               <p n="4">4. If you consider them both by the bare outward letter; yet as S.

                  </note> he exacteth them: and yet refuseth them: they were commanded; therby to shew the faith &amp; obedience of the Offerers: and yet he refused them in regarde of any value in the sacrifice it selfe: they were exacted, because of that which they did signifye: but he did not regarde them for any worthe or vertue in themselues. As when the Poste or other messenger bringes vs a letter, whose cariage must coste vs deare: Sir, here is a letter for you; pay me for the portage. If we desire firste to read it; he will say no, if he suspecte we will returne it him vnpayde: for he knowes we care not for the bulke of the letter, but for the meaning of the wordes: and that the paper of it selfe is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing nere worthe the price which he demandes: so the sacrifices of the olde lawe were required for signification of the Messias, and were accepted according to the faith of the offerers: not for any value which of it selfe was in the bloud of beastes, or in the swetenes of fruites.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Thus S. Ierome, and others note of Abel,<note place="margin">

                  </note> that our Lorde more respected the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son offering, then the sacrifice offered. And so S. Augustin obserueth in Abel 3. primarye vertues, vidz. he was the firste preist, the firste virgin, and first martyr: wherfore our lorde firste respected him, and then his sacrifice. And peraduenture Dauid here considering his owne vnworthynes by his sinnes so fowly committed, durste not presume to offer any sacrifice, because it may be, doubting he had not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently repented, he feared his person yet to be lothsome, &amp; therfore his sacrifices woulde not be accepted. So let vs take heede vnto our selues, O my soule, that we approache not to the Altar of God, whiles we haue a lothsome conscience, vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from sinne, for vnto such Esay threatneth, he that offereth an oxe, is as one who killeth a man; and he that sacrificeth a beast,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esay.</hi> 66.</note> is as one who beateth out the braynes of a dogge. For when a wicked wretche without repentance, whiles his person is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy yet dare meddle with holy thinges, he doth not pacifye but prouoke the wrathe of God against him, because he doth prophane and abuse diuine mysteryes, which if we vse them well are heauenly remedyes. So he that celebrateth or heareth masse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in mortall sinne without remorse, he is as Iudas, who boughte &amp; solde our Sauiour Christe, &amp; yet supped with him: And like the Iewes he crucifyeth agayne our lorde of life, who remayning in deadly sinne, doth receiue vnworthily the moste blessed body of our Sauiour; or in like sorte prophaneth any other holy sacrament. O let vs not as Iewes so kill such a man: nor so make our selues like vnto Iudas that dogge, who as he was hanged deserued allso to haue his braynes beaten out, as well as he had his belly burste, so that his bowells gushed out.</p>

But as it were too little, thoughe we shoulde giue all our Gods in almes, or suffer our bodyes to be burnte, not hauing in vs the true loue of God: so neither doth he require that voluntarily we shoulde too much hurte our selues with pretence of his loue, or in desire of dooing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; for this were to hinder, and not to further his seruice. And in this sense Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, and Socrates ordeyned that the people should offer small sacrifices vnto their Gods: the one said, because they shoulde so offer to daye and this yeare, that still they mighte haue somewhat to offer the nexte yeare and to morowe: the other said, because God hauing no neede of our giftes, he did rather regarde the harte of the giuer, then the greatnes of the gifte.</p>

deare, or too good for his seruice, or to testifye our obedience and loue vnto him. And then it doth appeare that he doth require them, when either he takes such thinges from vs by his prouidence, or by his holy inspirations he doth mooue vs to leaue all the worlde to enter into religion. And in these cases, he that giues the whole orcharde or Gardeyn all at once, doubtles his gifte is much more and farre better, then if he should continue euery day to giue some flowers of that Gardeyn, or some fruites of that orcharde. And althoughe the Goates hayre giuen by poore people to the building of Moyses tabernacle, and the poore widdowes mite in the Gospell, were no lesse acceptable to God,<note place="margin">

This is the description of perfecte Contrition, formed with complete charity: But Attrition which is imperfecte and somewhat vnformed, <hi>Is a sorowe of minde detesting sinne committed (though not alone and aboue all for the loue of God) and hath a purpose (with hope of pardon) euer to absteyne as least from mortall sinne, and to confesse, and to satisfye, as shalbe requisite.</hi> This Attrition of it selfe alone, is not sufficient to obteyne pardon, vntill there be added and adioined some sacrament vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, by which it obteyneth effectuall remission.</p>

Allso for the auoyding and preuenting of them, and to be absolued from them in guilte and in all punishment, we are much holpen and benefited by the vse of knocking our breastes, by holy water, holy bread, agnus dei, medalls, graynes &amp;c. hallowed by the prayers of the churche, in vertue of the bloud and merites of our Sauiour Christe.

As for as the sinnes, for which Contrition is required, it neede not be of euery particuler sinne in number to haue a seuerall Acte of contrition, but of all which we can remember, according to their number, or according to their kinde, we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test them all &amp; be sorye for them, either in one Acte of contrition, or in more, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And therfore in case of speedy or sodeyn death, one generall &amp; true Acte of contrition is sufficient for all our sinnes at once, considered in grosse as offences of God. And so it is in case we cannot well call to minde their seuerall numbers, nor their distincte kindes.</p>
               <p n="8">8. As for the times when euery one must be contrite, vnder payne of a new particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler sinne, they are set downe to be these. 1. whensoeuer we find our selues in euident danger of corporall death. 2. whensoeuer by occasion of sinne not repented, we see our selues in euident danger of spirituall death; that is to say; like to fall further into more damnable sinne. 3. In any publique &amp; greuous Calamity of the people or Common welthe which doth require our particuler prayers and humiliation vnto God allmighty for his mercy. In all these cases we are bound to be contrite, I say, vnder payne of a new &amp; particuler sinne of omission, vidz: against the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of repentance. Not that it is lawfull for any to remayne in mortall sinne vntill some of these times doo happen; no not a minute of an howre: for by the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against which the sinne is committed, we are euer presently bounde to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: althoughe, I say, not vnder payne of a particuler new sinne of vnrepentance beside the former, vntill we come to some of these times. And then, if we omitte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, it is a new particuler sinne beside the offence wherof before we remayned guilty.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Lastly our purpose of amendement must be sincere; and the performance must be effected according to our power: for if I seeme to be contrite, or doo confesse, and yet deteyne another mans goods, being able to restore them: or if I reserue any sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of hatred or malice against my neighbor, not striuing nor desiring to driue it or put it out from me: or if I doo not auoyde as much as I can all such dangerous occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as I haue found or may euidently preceiue doo vsually put me in great hazard of consenting or committing some mortall sinne: In all these cases, if I be not carefull to remedye or preuent them, surely my purpose is not sufficient, &amp; therfore I am not in such cases truly penitent.</p>
               <p n="20">20. But now when I haue once entirely vndergone the sacrament of penance, I am no more bound of necessity to iterate or repeate my repentance for the same sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And wise men doo giue it for good counsell, not to recall to our minde such passed sinnes as perteyning to delightes of our flesh, or to the honors or Riches of the worlde were so pleasing vnto vs, that their remembrance thoughe with pretence of remorse may mooue vs in thoughte agayne to delighte somewhat in them, as soone as in deede to be contrite for them. Except it be at such times, when either we feele

our selues in feruent deuotion, or finde in our selues such abundant mortification, that we neede not feare their enticement. Other wise, that which is delectable to our nature without speciall grace, will easily drawe vs to encline to his desire.</p>
               <p n="11">11. I said we are not bound of necessity to repeate our Contrition for the same sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: yet when without the said danger we haue opportunity, doubtles it is very conuenient somtimes to renew &amp; to repeate our contrition; and so to endeauour to make it sure &amp; good, least peraduenture before times it haue bene insufficient. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at the time of our death we haue neede to repeate it, and as much as we can to make all sure: yea, S.

               <p n="1">1. IT is good to knowe what be the qualityes of contrition: but the practise of them is much better. It is true; the greife &amp; sorowe of a contrite harte is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing &amp; bitter in the taste; but it will be afterwarde holsome &amp; comfortable as wormewood is to the stomacke: for sweete meates doo sooner cause corruption &amp; obstructions, when medicines which are bitter doo open &amp; purge the body.

consumed by sorowe for sinne, and against the punishment of wickednes, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of penance is a soueraigne remedye.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Only hereof we must haue a care, that our sorowe for sinne be sincere. If thou tell me thy body is wounded, shew me thy flesh bleeding or bruised: if thou tell me thy harte is contrite; let me see thy teares; or thoughe men preceiue it not, yet at least God allmighty must see thy sorowe. In proyning of the vine, if it distill any droppes, it is a signe it will be fruitfull; but if thy repentance be without teares, at least of contrition, surely thy amendement will be very barren.</p>

This thy virgin bessed in a double sorte, whiles she endeuours to mortifie the frayle sexe of her body, she ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the cruel worlde together with her body: wherfore neither fearing deathe nor any sauage kindes of tortures which are the freindes of death &amp;c.</hi> Beholde here twoo causes why she is blessed. 1. for mortification of her flesh. 2. for conquering of the worlde. And so in these wordes are compared <hi>penance</hi> with <hi>martyrdome,</hi> and <hi>conquering the worlde</hi> with <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of the fleshe.</hi> And hereupon is inferred, that whosoeuer labours to mortifie himselfe in contrition, doth therewithall prepare himselfe for martyrdome: for, they that afflicte their hartes with penance for the loue of God, the same will despise the worlde and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any tormentes of Tyrantes for the same loue of God. And so, if martyrdome be an acceptable sacrifice vnto God, mortification allso &amp; such an afflicted spirite may well be termed a sacrifice, because it is a continuall liuing martyrdome.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Nay, in one respect, a true contrite harte daily continued, is eyther equall, or may be preferred before an ordinary martyrdome: for as Seneca said, <hi>melius est femel scindi quam semper premi</hi>: it is better to haue the head strooke of all at one sharpe blowe then to haue it hackled or harshly cutte of with a handsawe. And so S. Martin Bishop of Turyn estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the prolonging of his life a greater labour then suffring of death, saying vnto God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty in a prayer made on his death bed, <hi>Domine si adhuc populo tuo sum necessarius, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uso laborem: O lord if yet I be necessary for thy people, I doo not refuse the labour.</hi> In res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecte of which wordes the churche saith in his following Anthymne, that he was a man <hi>Nec labore victum, nec morte vincendum: neither ouercome by labour, nor by death to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:28012:62"/>
In the Breuiary the reason is added. For he neither feared to dye, nor refused to liue. In which wordes we see that what S. Martin called <hi>labour</hi> these wordes doo name <hi>life</hi>: &amp; therfore doo inferre, that he would not be conquered by the paynes of death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was so constant in the labours of life. For thoughe death be fearfull to nature, yet in truthe, it is an end of sinne and of misery: wheras the prolonging of a penitent and contrite life, is the continuance of a lingring martyrdome, which out of doubte hath a wonderfull great merite. For as in our excessiue vse of phisicke for feare of sicknes or death, well said Martial, <hi>Hic rogo, non furor est, ne moriare, mori</hi>? Is it not a folly to dye, for feare of death? according as we say, he liues miserably who liues medicinally, that is, not in regarde of temperate dyet, or discrete physicke, but in respecte of vntimely or immoderate medicines, or of too nice a care to kepe vs from euery winde that blowes. Or as indeede a crazed weake sickely body had better be dead at once, then linger in payne, and to be in hazarde and feare of euery ayre, and of euery meate, for euery small matter may soone distemper him; so it is easyer for our frayle dispositions by death to be quitte from our inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rmityes and sinnes, then for a contrite harte to liue in danger of so many tentations, euer striuing against disordinate delightes? auoyding the pleasures which other men seeke; brideling his appetites; measuring and weighing all his desires, marking and composing the very motions and gestures of his feete, handes, and eyes; &amp; neuer putting in effecte, nor consenting to any thoughte, which firste is not examined by the rule of a good conscience. Such a contribulated spirite is a sacrifice to God, as well as martyrdome: not troubled with superfluous scrupulosity but contribulated with reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious vigilancy: This liuing contribulation is a liuely sacrifice of great merite.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And as Seneca said, he is worthy of prayse, <hi>quem non piget mori, cum lubet viuere,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom it is not yrkesome to dye,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epist.</hi> 55.</note> when he may haue ioye in his life (for it is small commendacion to desire to dye only because we are vexed with our life) so it is a matter of merite, to be content to liue in labour, danger, &amp; contrition, when by our death we mighte haue ease, ioye, and content. So S. Paul desired <hi>to be dissolued, &amp; to be with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste,</hi> in regarde of the gayne which cometh by death; and yet was content to liue in labour for the profite and seruice of Gods Churche.

In like sorte many other places out of the Ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Doctors mighte be alledged, &amp; thoughe some of them in some places doo referre those wordes vnto spirituall sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, yet doo they not therfore exclude that which themselues or others haue direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly construed allso for a materiall sacrifice. For reall sacrifices must be allso spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally offered: and as the lawe &amp; religion of nature &amp; Moyses, had their materiall out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sacrifices, so must our lawe of grace &amp; the gospell planted by Iesus Christe. And this appeareth by the succession which Malachy maketh of his prophecyed sacrifice vnto the sacrifices of Moyses lawe: for if vnder Christe we haue true preists and a preisthood of Melchisedec, it is necessary allso we haue reall proper sacrifices which only these preistes may offer vp, which therfore must be somewhat else beside prayers and meere spirituall sacrifices: for the offering of these perteyneth vnto others, as well as vnto preistes, &amp; therfore are no proper reall sacrifices.</p>
               <p n="17">17. As for those places of S. Paul to the Hebrewes: that Christe was offered once for all and needeth no more to be offered: It is most true, in the maner of a bloudye sacrifice: but the masse is called by the olde Doctors (as you see aboue) a sacrifice vnbloudye. And allso he speaketh of the sacrifice of the crosse, as primary &amp; inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, and therfore most sufficient neuer to be iterated: but this sacrifice of the masse is depending thereon &amp; secondary; wherfore as representing that former sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, &amp; deriuing vertue from thence, it is but a continuance &amp; application of the same.<note place="margin">

                  </note> And so S. Ambrose answereth in effecte, saying. What doo we? doo we not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer euery day? verily we doo offer: but dooing it for remembrance of his death. And this sacrifice is but one, not many: for that was once offered <hi>in sancto sanctorum,</hi> but this sacrifice is a representation of that: we doo alwayes offer the same sacrifice not now verily one lambe, to morowe another, but awayes the same sacrifice: Therfore the sacrifice is one: otherwise, because it is offered in many places, there shoulde be many Christes. Not so: but Christe is one euery where our Highpreist: he offered a sacrifice cleansing vs; we doo now allso offer the same. But that which now we sacrifice it is done in commemoration of that which was sacrificed; not another sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, as the highe preist, but we doo alwayes sacrifice the same. Thus farre S. Ambrose, teaching that we now doo not offer a sacrifice alltogether different from the firste, but the selfe same in respecte of the thing offered thoughe diuerse in regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of the maner; which in the <hi>Masse</hi> is done vnbloudily, and was bloudily done vpon the crosse: Neither is the <hi>Masse</hi> altogether of the same efficacye with that of the cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se: for now we doo not sacrifice to reconcile mankinde vnto God anewe &amp; agayne, as by another new &amp; firste Acte of reconciliation; but only to deriue &amp; to applye vnto our selues the fruite of that primary, principall, firste, &amp; infinite sacrifice on the crosse.</p>
               <p n="18">18. The sacrifice of the crosse firste merited: and the sacrifice of the Altar deriues that merite. By that firste, the remedye is sufficient; &amp; by this second it is effectuall. That had merite of infinite measures; but the measure of merite in this is finite &amp; proportionable vnto vs. according as we in our deuotion doo applye it: and therfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re that sacrifice being infinite was but once offered, wheras this is offered euery daye, being proportionate &amp; finite, to the end that we may daily haue more merite hereby applyed.
