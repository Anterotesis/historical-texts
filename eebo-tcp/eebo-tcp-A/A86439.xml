            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <!-- PDF PAGE 75 -->plot which was intended to reſcue that old Prieſt <hi>William Waler,</hi> is the Theame which I am to treat on, which thus begins.</p>
            <p>Upon Saturday, being the foure and twentieth of <hi>July,</hi> was this Prieſt condemned, which being divulged amongſt his fellow Recuſants, upon Sunday they a great number gathered together to the ſumme of threeſcore, neer <hi>Curſitors</hi> Ally in <hi>Chancery</hi> Lane, a place, where the now dead Prieſt lodged, to finde out ſome way to deliver him out of the hands of his enemies, the bloudy Heretikes; they long did hold counſell, one ſaid hee would goe as to viſit him in Newgate, and change apparell with him, and ſo let him eſcape, and take his puniſhment himſelfe, for hee ſaid it was piety to redeem a Prieſt, though with the loſſe of his own life, they all condiſcended to his propoſition, and after Maſſe being ſung, and a company of papiſticall prayers ſaid over him, they bid him goe and be reſolute, not fearing the malice of Heretikes, which could never be able to do him any harm, in ſo much as he was innocent of thoſe crimes which the Prieſt was condemned for, and by ſo dying he ſhould be quitted of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and go preſently to Heaven, and enjoy the preſence of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which words being ſaid, they gathered money amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and gave it unto him, charging him to be charitable to his brother priſoners; having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the money, away goes this fellow whoſe name was <hi>Ward,</hi> one of <hi>Wallers</hi> by-names, by which ſometimes he was called: this <hi>Ward</hi> being
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156994:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 76 -->come nigh Newgate, hee began to queſtion with himſelfe, why hee ſhould run reſolutely unto death before hee had deſerved it, the Prieſt ſaid hee is fourſcore yeers of age, and I ſcarce forty, long hee cannot live, as for my part I may doe <hi>Rome</hi> much ſervice yet: poore I was, which my brethren have remedied, by furniſhing mee with this money, they bid me be charitable to my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low priſoners, ſo I will, when I go to priſon, in the mean-while, Charity begins firſt at home: thus meditating with himſelf, he goes to a friends houſe and writes a Letter to his brethren what thoughts came unto him, and ſure hee was that they were ſent from above, for an Angell hee ſaid ſtood by him, and bade him flie ſpeedily to <hi>Rome,</hi> and make the brethren acquainted with the Martyrdome of their brother <hi>Waller,</hi> who in time ſhould ſufficiently revenge his death; the Letter being writ, hee met with one <hi>John Hodgskins</hi> 2 Porter, whom hee knew very well, and gave him ſixe pence to carrie the Letter to ſuch a place, the Porter told him hee would; away went the Papiſt, and away went the Porter, the porter had not gone far but hee forgot the place, no ſuperſcription being wrote, for feare of the diſcovery of their meeting, upon the Letter. And the porter being greedy to get ſomewhat of him to whom the letter was to be delivered, very cunningly broke up the Letter, to ſeeke for his name if it were there, which to find he read the whole letter, which being done hee cloſed it up again, and makes directly towards the place of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156994:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 76 -->their meeting, thinking to reveal them all, or elſe receive a good reward for the concealement of them. But when hee came to the place his hopes were fruſtrated, for they were all gone before he came, their walking place was empty, wherefore he went home and to a gentleman ſhewed the letter, from whoſe mouth upon Tueſday being the 27 of <hi>July,</hi> I had the relation, which I thought fit gentle reader to commit to the preſſe, that all might know with what policy the Devill deludes ſuch ſimple men, by croſſing their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations. It was a very likely matter, was it not? that any one ſhould, being a ſtranger, have admittance to the preſence of a Traytor having ſcarce a day to live; and then was it not an honeſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly for <hi>Ward</hi> to write to them that an Angell had commanded him to fly to <hi>Rome,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Letter conſiſted of that which all their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion doth, falſehood, for were I but intended to write more then a pamphlet, <hi>I</hi> would declare ſuch damned fictions which are holden as a truth amongſt them, would ſtrike the Reader in aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which to doe at this time I ſhall not, Farewell.</p>
