            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Here preſent you Mounſieur <hi>Balzac's</hi> Letters, which may well be termed new ones, even after the eighth Edition; for though they have long ſince been in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of publick favour, yet I may juſtly ſay, this is the firſt time their Authour hath avouched them. The advantagious Judgement you have delivered of him, and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor wherewith all <hi>France</hi> hath followed your approbation, well deſerveth his beſt endeavours toward the perfectionating ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things: I have been ſolicitous to draw him to this labour, to the end the world might know, that if I be not worthy the ſhare I have in his reſpects, yet that I have at leaſt been wiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make right uſe of my good fortune, and to cauſe it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſerviceable to the glory of my Countrey. But truly, were he maſter of his body, or did his maladies afford him liberty of ſpirit, he would not ſuffer any but himſelf to ſpeak in this cauſe; and his pen performing no ſlight acts, would have conſecrated his own labours, and the wonders they have produced. But ſince evils have no prefixed time of durance, and in that all the good interims which hereafter may befall him, are wholly to be, imployed in his Book, <hi>The Prince;</hi> I eſteemed it to ſmall purpoſe to attend his health in this buſineſſe, and that it was now no longer any time to deferre the purging of theſe curious Letters from ſuch blemiſhes as ill impreſſions had left upon them. They ſhall therefore non appear in the parity wherein they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and with all their naturall ornaments: Beſides, I have added divers letters of his, not as yet come to light, which may ſerve as a ſubject of greater ſatisfaction to all men, and be as a recompenſe of the honour wherewith he hath collected the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And truly (my Lord) had it been poſſible to place in the
<pb facs="tcp:120345:5"/>
Frontiſpiece of this Book, a more illuſtrous name then yours, or ſhould Mounſieur de <hi>Balzac's</hi> inclination and mine have been farre from any ſuch intention, yet would not the order of things, or the law of decency have permitted any other refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, then what I now make: I ſpeak not at this preſent, of that dazeling greatneſſe whereunto you are elevated, nor of that ſo rare and neceſſary vertue, which rightly to recognize, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt King on earth hath eſteemed himſelf not to be over able. I will only ſay, I had reaſon to ſubmit an eloquence produced in the ſhade, and formed in ſolitarineſſe, to this other eloquence quickned both with voice and action, cauſing you to reign in ſovereignity at all aſſemblies. Certainly, my Lord, you are more powerfull by this incomparable quality, then by the authority wherein the King hath placed you: The only accent of your voice hath a hidden property, to charm all ſuch as hearken unto you; none can be poſſeſſed with any ſo wilfull paſſions, who will not be appeaſed by the reaſons you propound; and after you have ſpoken, you will at all times remain maſter of that part of man, no way ſubject to the worlds order, and which hath not any dependency upon lawfull power, or tyrannicall uſurpation. This is a truth, my Lord, as well known as your name, and which you ſo ſolidly confirmed at the laſt aſſembly of the Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; as that in the great diverſity of humours and judgements, whereof it was compoſed, there was peradventure this only point well reſolved on, <hi>That you are the moſt eloquent man living.</hi> This being true, I can no way doubt, but the peruſall of this Book I offer unto you, will extraordinarily content you, and that you will be pleaſed to retire thither, ſometimes to recreate your ſpirits after agitation, and to ſuſpend thoſe great thoughts, who have for their object the good of all <hi>Europe.</hi> It is a book, my Lord, wherein you ſhall find no common thing but the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; (where entertaining ſome particular perſon) Mounſieur de <hi>Balzac</hi> reades Leſſons to all men; and where amidſt the beauty of Complements and dexterity of Jeaſting, he often teacheth of the moſt ſublime point of Philoſophy: I mean not that wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling part thereof which rejecteth neceſſary verities, to ſeek after unprofitable ones, which cannot exerciſe the underſtanding without provoking paſſions, nor ſpeak of moderation without diſtemper, and putting the ſoul into diſorder: But of that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:120345:5"/>
                     <hi>Pericles</hi> heretofore made himſelf maſter of <hi>Athens,</hi> and wherewith <hi>Epaminondas</hi> raiſed himſelf to the prime place of <hi>Greece:</hi> which tempereth the manners of particulars, regulateth the obligation of Princes, and neceſſarily bringeth with it the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of all States where they command. This book will make it apparent even to your enemies, that your life hath been at all times equally admirable, though not alwayes alike glorious: How you have conſerved the opinion of your vertue, even in the time of your hardeſt fortunes, and how in the greateſt fury of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and in the moſt extreme violence of your affairs, the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of your actions hath never been reduced to the only teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of your conſcience. To conclude, It is in this Book, my Lord, where I ſuppoſe you will be pleaſed to read the preſages of your preſent greatneſſe, and what hath been foretold; not by Aſtrologicall Rules, or the aſpect of ſome Conſtellation, but by a true diſcourſe founded upon the maximes of Reaſon, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of things paſt; cauſing him to preſume, that God hath not conferred ſuch extraordinary endowments upon you, to be for ever encloiſtered within your ſelf: And that he hath loved <hi>France</hi> better, then to deprive her of the good you ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her. But all theſe verities ſhall one day be compriſed in that work the King, by your mouth, my Lord, hath commanded Mounſieur de <hi>Balzac</hi> to undertake, and which one year of lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure will effect. There ſhall it be, where he will cauſe all men to confeſſe, that to have the pourtract of a perfect Prince, the reign of ſo great a Monarch as ours, is to be attended; that the Divine Providence never ſhewed it ſelf more apparantly, then in the conduct of his deſignes, and in the event of his enterpriſes; and how Heaven hath ſo farre declared it ſelf in his favour, that were his ſtate aſſaulted on all ſides, and all ordinary meanes of defence ſhould fail him; he hath vertue ſufficient to ſave himſelf, and perform miracles. Now as you are the prime intelligence of his Councell, and your cogitations the firſt cauſes of the good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions therein taken, you are not to doubt, my Lord, but you likewiſe poſſeſſe the principall place therein, after his Majeſty; and that you participate more then any other of his triumphs. There ſhall you be revenged of all thoſe wretched writings you have formerly ſleighted: There the ſpirits of all men ſhall be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the juſtice of your deportments, and calumny it ſelf will
<pb facs="tcp:120345:6"/>
there be ſo powerfully convinced, that to cry down ſo legall a government as yours, ill affected <hi>French-men,</hi> and thoſe ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers enemies to this Crown, will find no further pretext in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, nor credulity among men. And truly, when I (on the one ſide) conſider how fatall it is to thoſe who govern, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the envy of great ones, and complaints of meaner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and how Publick affairs have this fatality, as how pure ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the adminiſtration of the reſt be, they ſtill afford ſufficient co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to calumny, to diſguiſe them and cauſe them to appear unjuſt. And on the otherſide: when I conſider that to guide this State is no leſſe then to manage a body having no one ſound part; and how there is no ſick perſon who doth not ſometimes murmure againſt his Phyſician; I dare be confident (my Lord) that ſuch a man as Monſieur de <hi>Balzac</hi> will not prove unuſefull unto you, and that the luſter of your actions, and glory of your life ſhall receive no diminution in his hands. I would ſay more, did I not fear to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige him in commending him, or if I believed him to be ſo great a ſelf admirer as his enemies figure him unto us. But I who have ſufficiently ſtudied him to know him, and who am acquainted with his moſt ſecret Inclinations, and the moſt particular conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions he hath in his ſoul, and of a far different opinion to theirs. I will therefore reſt there (my Lord) and not to cauſe you to looſe more time, and to the end you may the ſooner enjoy the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, this excellent Book prepareth for you: I will ſatisfie my ſelf in letting you know, that I eſteem not my ſelf ſo unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as formerly I did, ſince I have happened upon ſo fair an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to let you know that I am,</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Doubt not but amongſt thoſe who ſhall ſee theſe Works ſome there are who will eſteem them worthy a more advantagious Title then that of <hi>Letters,</hi> as well in regard of the greatneſſe of thoſe things therein frequently handled, as in reſpect of the exactneſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they ſeem to have been compoſed: But as I willingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe thoſe, who with unapt complements imagine they have compoſed a good Letter; nor do any more blame ſuch as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in never digreſſe from their particular affairs; ſo muſt I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe acknowledge, that ſuch writings as theſe, having not been made with any intention to be put in Print, the World might well have paſſed without them: And that it is onely allowed to the <hi>Germanes</hi> to give account to the age they live in, and to poſterity forſooth, concerning the affairs and fortunes of their
<pb facs="tcp:120345:7"/>
particular families, and of the ſilly acts of their Colleagues Truly it is an errour to believe, that grave and ſolemn ſubjects are to be baniſhed out of all Letters, or that even elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ought but ſlackly therein to appear; and that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of both theſe is onely reſerved for Pulpits and Panegyrick Orations; as though valour never appeared ſave only in pitch'd Battels; and that in ſingle Combates it were lawfull to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or that virtue therein were utterly unuſefull, becauſe it hath fewer witneſſes, neither is ſo fully regarded: But beſides that, we are no longer in thoſe times wherein the State government was publickly queſtioned, where the Oratours forced the Lieutenants generall of armies to render account of their ſeverall charges; and that conſequently, there is no more any means remaining to become eloquent in that kind: Yet are there reaſons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may underſtand the merit of Letters to be of no leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard then that of Orations. Howbeit, if there be any neceſſity to find ſome difference between theſe; this at leaſt can neither be in regard of the dignity of the Subjects the force of Reaſons, the gracefulneſs of Diſcourſes, nor in the ſublimity of Conceits. To ſpeak truth, when I conſider the Orations yet remaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ruines of former ages, ſome whereof were publickly pronounced, others onely penned; I am ſo farre from admiring any advantage they have over thoſe Letters now extant among us both of the ſame Authours and Ages, as I do not ſo much as wonder at all, how the firſt having been armed with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and voice, together with the geſture and motion of the body, have produced ſuch prodigious effects as we all know and have ſo often, as it were by main force, extorted the conſents of all hearers; yet the ſecond, though they had not the like armes and allurements have notwithſtanding not been any way deficient. Thoſe ſmooth Exordiums whereby they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, and put themſelves by eaſie acceſſes, as it were into poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Readers, thoſe ſtraites and paſſages whereby they conduct the ſpirits of men from pleaſant to painfull, and from grievous, to gracious objects, to the end that having in a manner
<pb facs="tcp:120345:7"/>
ſhaken and caſt them out of their former ſtations, they may afterwards force them to fall on what ſide they pleaſe. Surely all theſe advantages are ſo peculiar to Orations, as I ingeniouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſe, Letters do not ſo much as know what they mean. In theſe, we enter at the firſt daſh upon the matter, nor do we ſcarce at any time, quit the ſame; the reaſons go altogether alone without aſſiſtance, and all the ornament allowed them, is onely freedome of conceptions, the fecundity of language, and that they paſſe not promiſcuouſly. But as concerning the Subjects, they are common to both kinds of writings, and it is an errour to imagine, there are ſome particular to the one, that the other cannot touch upon the ſame without injury thereunto. Upon the matter, Panegyrick diſcourſes, Apologies, Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Judgements upon Morall actions, whether good or bad opinions and cenſures upon occurrents of thoſe which pleaſe, and thoſe we ought to deteſt, yea even indifferent accidents; briefly whatſoever may fall into diſcourſe, and under reaſon, are the objects of Letters: So we ſee, the greateſt and moſt important myſteries of our religion have been left unto us in Letters. All the wiſdome of the <hi>Pagans</hi> is contained in thoſe of <hi>Seneca,</hi> and we owe to thoſe <hi>Cicero</hi> wrote to his friends, the knowledge of the ſecrets, and certain inducements which cauſed the greateſt revolutions the world hath ever known, to wit the ſhaking and ſubverſion of the <hi>Roman Reipublicke,</hi> we are therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Oratorical Treatiſes to have no other ſubject then Letters: and that if there be any difference, it is none other then what is obſerved between our ancient Seas, and thoſe not diſcovered unto us till in our fathers times. The latter are no leſſe deep then the other; they are capable of the like ſhipping; their ebbes, and floods are neither more juſt, nor leſſe uncertain; and all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference diſcovered between them is onely this, that the winds toſſe not thoſe in like ſort as it doth ours, and in that they are ſeldome or never ſubject either to ſtormes, or tempeſts. In like manner it being within the power and capacity of Letters to treat of the ſame things, how much more eminent and excellent
<pb facs="tcp:120345:8"/>
ſoever one may conceive them to be then any other kind of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, yet do they not indeed receive thoſe extraordinary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which appear in Orations, ſince neither the like height of exceſſe, nor the ſame Enthuſiaſmes or raptures are herein found; In a word, it is a more middle beauty, and a more calm elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. And ſurely, if the ſubject we make uſe of be as illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious as the perſon before whom we are to handle it, were it not as much as to abuſe both the one and the other, to come ſhort in our expreſſions: Since the action ought neither to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, nor generall, if you intend to performe it negligently, and not to allow it all the ornaments whereof it is capable. And who can doubt that <hi>Cicero</hi> being to make an Oration before <hi>Ceſar,</hi> after the change of the Common-wealth, had not a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter apprehenſion, and prepared not himſelf with more ſtudious care, then if he had onely ſpoken to that beaſt with an hundred heads, he had ſo often led after his own Phantaſie, and whereof he was in ſo full poſſeſſion ſo long before, as to cauſe them to take the part beſt pleaſing unto him. In theſe laſt occaſions, and in the preſence of this man alone, he knew with whom he had to do: Now had he been timerous, or fearfull to fail before his Maſter, yet impute not this apprehenſion of his to proceed either out of conſideration he had of his greatneſſe, nor from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon thoſe things he came to accompliſh: But it was in that he conſidered him as a man no leſſe verſed in the art of well-ſpeaking then himſelf, and who had heretofore contributed to the ſtudy of this ſcience, ſo many rare gifts of ſpirit, and ſo many faire endowments of nature, that had he not afterward eſteemed it more noble to conquer men by armes, then to convince them by arguments, and if of the two moſt excellent exerciſes this of his life, fortune, and the famouſneſſe of his courage, had not cauſed him to make choiſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, he might eaſily have diſputed for the glory of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with him. Or were it ſo that this excellent Oratour might at this day return into the world, and were perſonally, or by his Pen to diſcourſe with thoſe two great Cardinalls to whom the
<pb facs="tcp:120345:8"/>
moſt part of theſe Letters are addreſt, it is not probable, coming to know them as we do, that he would imploy, and contribute a more exact ſtudy and ſolicitude, then when he was onely to pleaſe a multitude of ignorant <hi>Plebeians,</hi> and to ſpeak to all that rabble of ancient <hi>Rome,</hi> we ſhall yet again be amazed at the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of theſe Letters, ſome whereof are written to the King, and appointed to be read (as in truth they were) with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in full counſell, and a great part of the reſt addreſſed to the moſt eminent perſons of our age. To ſpeak truth we may juſtly ſay, this is the firſt time any thing of perfection hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in our language; ſo that if of all our ancient eloquence there be ought worthy of eſteem in any equality with this, it may be that with much labour you ſhall produce ſome one Letter: For of all ſuch who have hitherto written, we may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the moſt fortunate among them, when they made choiſe of ſubjects able to ſubſiſt of themſelves, have not been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely condemnable, and that amidſt their writings, the ſolidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of learning, and the ſavageneſſe of language (to wit) the good and evill did equally appear. But when at any time they fell upon ſubjects where eloquence onely ſwayed the Scepter, there truly it was where fortune forſook them, and where the feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their proper forces was manifeſtly perceived, if they were not ſome way aſſiſted by ſtrange tongues. Some of them (to ſay the truth) have doubted what way they were to take, and have ſtriven to ſhew it to others, though themſelves were not in it. In a word, the greateſt glory thoſe gained who have written with moſt perfection and purity, is onely that which nature hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for women, to which ſex eminent actions being denied, it ſeemeth they perform ſufficient if they abſtain from evil doing. But to ſay that any hath joyned Art to abundance, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled mildneſſe with Majeſty, or hath raiſed his ſtile without either looſing himſelf, or ſtraying from his ſubject, that is it which in truth we could not ſee till this preſent. And queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe theſe brave and generous formes of diſcourſe, and thoſe great and ſtrange conceptions wherewith theſe Letters were ſo
<pb facs="tcp:120345:9"/>
curiouſly limed, and ſo plentifully graced, have been very ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly known in proceeding ages: This very order, and this number, whereof every tongue is not capable, and wherein ours owes nothing to the Latine, and which appeares in all his words, though diverſly, and as their gender requires, do right haply appear in this place, though the moſt part of writers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him have eſteemed theſe perfections of ſmall importance; yet notwithſtanding, without the helpe of theſe two great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, nether ornaments of Art, nor graces of Nature, can be but in part pleaſing; nor can all the reaſons the World can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge perſwad a Very woman reſoluing to reſiſt: And to ſpeake ſeriouſly, they are no leſſe neceſſary among excellent diſcourſes, and conceits, then diſcipline amongſt Souldiers, without which, courage is of no effect, and valour moſt commonly proveth unprofitable. As for me who have known the Authour from both our infancies, and who better then all others, can depoſe in what faſhion he effecteth his labours; beſides, knowing the great advantage he hath over all thoſe who write at this day: I haue ever thought that if any were able to raiſe our Language to the merit and reputation of ſuch Eloquence, werewith the Ancients were adorned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it ſhould be to him alone to whom our age oweth this glory. Nor do I doubt, but the compariſon co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in queſtion at this preſent, between theſe his writings, and thoſe of others; the difference will be eaſily diſcovered, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my ſelf, that all ſpirits will diſpoſe themſelves to be ranged herein to mine opinion and voluntarily to give way thereunto. As for my ſelf, who read the Ancients with all reſpect due unto them, and the Moderns without any prejudicate opinion, do notwithſtanding confeſſe, that all I can conceive in others is ſo far ſhort of the merit of theſe Letters, that abſtracting from the paſſion I am poſſeſſed with, both for them, and their Authour, hardly could I diſpoſe my ſelf to frame this Preface for them. And who is there will make any difficulty to give them their due? Since he whoſe very faults have been eſteemed ſo fair, that they cauſed a Sect during his life, which yet continues
<pb facs="tcp:120345:9"/>
after his death; having (at Meats) ſeen certain diſcourſes this Authour compoſed in thoſe miſerable times, and which ſtood in need of another age to be gratefully regarded, was aſtoniſhed at his beginnings, confeſſing it was with unwillingneſſe, that the onely thing he ſuppoſed to poſſeſſe by the generall conſent of all, was raviſhed from him by one who as yet had lived but twenty yeares. But ſurely, it was in this ſtrain of writing which in that it is not reſtrained within ſo ſtrict limits as that of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is capable of all the motions, and ornaments of Art; and of the ſame ſort as was the other diſcourſe he addreſſeth to the Pope who now is, upon the like ſubject, as that of Saint <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards</hi> to <hi>Eugenius:</hi> And as God never choſe among men any ſo accompliſhed with all perfections, as this perſon to command all others, ſo can I not conceive any thing either more great, or extraordinary, then what appeareth in this work, nor more ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the excellency of the ſubject, and to the Majeſty of him to whom he dedicated his diſcourſe: But if (to return to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of theſe letters) it were neceſſary for the delivering an unpartiall judgement, to conſider thoſe of the Antients, I ſhould ſeem more reſpectfull then were requiſite, if (puting them all together) I ſhould undertake to make them ſo much as enter into compariſon with theſe; excepting onely thoſe of <hi>Seneca,</hi> yea even in thoſe (which in truth come not near theſe) there is ſo infinite abundance of matter, as can hardly be imagined, and ſince all things therein appear ſo confuſedly, that it ſeems they were therein couched without choice, and to ſay truth, as it were at adventure, ſome who will yet further tax his ſtile will happily ſay, they are rather matters then Works. But for my part, if there be any defects therein, I hold they ought well to be borne with, in regard of ſo many rarities therein concurring; and when we have ſaid all, what appearance is there to undervalue any thing we receive from a man who was worth ſeven Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gold? and who once in his life had the heart and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to aſpire to the Empire of the whole world? Let us therefore eſteem all we receive from him, and from thoſe times, yet ſuffer
<pb facs="tcp:120345:10"/>
us to commend our own, wherein this ſcience which meddleth with the commanding of ſpirits, and which was but formerly in it's infancy, is now found to be in his full maturity, and as it were of ripe years. If therefore you acknowledge any obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion due (as in truth there is) to theſe excellent Letters, you ſhall in ſhort time ſee ſo ſolid, and juſt a judgement proceed from this Authour, that the Parliament it ſelf produced not any more able; and his ſolitarineſſe will be ſo ſatisfactory unto you, that you will make no more difference then I do, to prefer the ſame before the magnificence of Princely Courts, and the Pomp of moſt ſtatelieſt Cities.</p>

by all <hi>France</hi> to preſent her Petitions to the King, and by the King him ſelf to convey his Commands into Cities and Armies: My Lord, I muſt humbly then acknowledge you have already payed me before hand for all the ſervices I can ever poſſibly perform unto you: and I ſhould ſhew my ſelf very ungratefull, if I ſhould hereafter complain of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes: ſince upon the matter, the goods and honours of this World are moſt ordinarily none other, than the inheritance of <hi>Sots,</hi> or rewards of Vice, Eſtimation, and Commendation, being onely reſerved for Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.

But truely (my Lord) that is a thing which will always be wanting to your glorie; for when by your onely preſence you have appeaſed the ſpirits of an incenſed multitude; when by your powerfull reaſons you have induced Chriſtian Princes to ſet the Native Countrey of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> at liberty, &amp; to undertake the <hi>Holy War,</hi> when you have gained whole Nations to the Church, as well by the force of your <hi>Example,</hi> as by that of your <hi>Doctrine,</hi> who is of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to pay you the reputation which you in all right deſerve? and where ſhall you finde ſo excellent a witneſs for all the marvellous Acts of your life, as I have of my watchings and ſtudies? I cannot chuſe but reiterate this, and my joy is over-juſt to be concealed. Is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this great wit and high ſpirit, which hath been imployed even from his firſt youth in perſwading Princes, in giving inſtructions to Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, and hath been liſtned unto by old men, who have ſeen four Reigns? Is it poſſible, I ſay, this man ſhould value me; on whoſe appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation all enemies agree? nor is there among all men a contrary party, or diverſity of belief in this point. If I had a purpoſe to diſquiet the repoſe of this Kingdom, I would ſeek for the conſent of ſlack ſpirits; and I ſhould ſtand in need in my favour of all ſorts of men, were I to ſtudy for reputation in a popular State: but truely I never affected con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, or diſorder, and my deſigns have ever aimed at the pleaſing of a few. For ſince you have declared your ſelf in favour, as he likewiſe hath done, for whom <hi>France</hi> at this day envieth <hi>Italy:</hi> and ſince you carry after you the moſt ſolid part of the Court, I am content to let the reſt run aſtray with <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> who make the greater number of mankinde. Yet (my Lord) I cannot think, that any hereafter will be ſo far in love with himſelf, or ſo obſtinate in his own opinion, as not to be a Convertite by the onely reading the Letter you honoured me with, and who in concluſion will not ſubſcribe to your great judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And, if it be certain that truth it ſelf could not be ſtrong enough againſt you, there is no queſtion, but that ſide whereon you two ſhall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:120345:15"/>
agree, ought to be univerſally followed. For my part (my Lord) let all men ſay what they will, I fix my ſelf with cloſed eys there; and what enemies ſoever the reputation you have allowed me procure me, yet knowing your abilities, and what you are, I will be no farther ſolicitous for mine own intereſt, or future benefit, ſince it is become your cauſe.</p>

But happen what can, I am moſt aſſured, you will remain conſtant even amidſt publick ruins, and that <hi>Fortune</hi> cannot bereave you of thoſe advantages ſhe never gave you.

If <hi>Virtue</hi> required any recompence out of her ſelf, ſhe would not receive it from other mouth than yours: and your reputation is at this day ſo <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>General,</hi> as it is become a <hi>Verity,</hi> wherein the Wiſe agree with the Vulgar.

Yet (my Lord) you have ſo great power over me, that I will ſtrain my ſelf to ſhew my obedience, and to give you an account of my leaſure, ſince you pleaſe to think I ought not to deprive the World thereof. It is better to utter glorious dreams, than to labour in groſs deſigns, and there are certain Acts of the ſpirit ſo excellent, that Princes are too poor, and their power too ſlender to afford them their full merit. But, my Lord, you have often given ſo great teſtimonies of me, that if I ſhould not have ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, it were fit I loſt my memory; wherefore out of the aſſurance you give me that my Stile doth not ſtray from that perfection, which men imagine, but never ſaw, nor have attained unto; I will enter upon a deſign which ſhall amaze our vulgar wits, and cauſe thoſe, who have hitherto ſuppoſed they ſurmount others, to ſee I have found what they ſeek for.

But this is not the place where I intend to ſpeak, it being of too ſmall extent to receive ſo illimitable a ſubject: It ſhall therefore ſuffice in concluſion of this my <hi>Letter</hi> to tell you, that ſince upon your advice all poſterity dependeth, and the whole <hi>Court</hi> expecteth from you what they are, or are not to believe; I cannot chuſe (my Lord) but to eſteem my ſelf right happy, even amidſt my greateſt miſeries, if you ſtill continue unto me your equal <hi>Judgement</hi> with the honour of your favours.</p>

Yet ſince herein the publick good meeteth with your particular intereſt, and that for your ſake the Church rejoyceth, even in all the moſt irkſome Priſons of <hi>Europe,</hi> it is not reaſonable you ſhould deprive your ſelf of a contentment no leſs chaſt, than thoſe <hi>heaven</hi> it ſelf affordeth us? and which proceedeth from the ſame cauſe. All good men (my Lord) ought in theſe times to deſire great Dignities, as neceſſary means to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake great matters. If they do otherwiſe, beſides that God will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a ſtrict account from them of thoſe his graces, whereof they have made no good uſe; the World hath likewiſe juſt ſubject of complaint, ſeeing them abandon it as a prey to the wicked, and that their deſire of eaſe cauſeth them to forſake the publick good. This (my Lord) is to let you know, you are to reſerve your <hi>humility</hi> for thoſe actions, paſſing between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>your ſelf:</hi> But that in other caſes you can neither have too much Wealth, nor over great power; ſince <hi>obedience</hi> is due to <hi>wiſdom;</hi> there being certain virtues not practiſeable by the poor. I do therefore infinitely rejoyce, to ſee you at this preſent raiſed to that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent dignity, wherein you fill the Univerſe with Splendor, and where your ſole example will (I hope) carry ſo great weight, as to cauſe the Church to return to the Purity of its firſt <hi>Infancy.</hi> Truely, if there be any hope to expect this happineſs, and to ſee rebellious ſpirits per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, as we behold their Cities forced; you doubtleſs are the man, from whom we are to expect this felicity; and who is onely able to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the victories of Kings by the ſubverſion of misbelievers: To this effect doth all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> exact theſe atchievements at your hands, as a laſt inſtruction, and the general peace of conſciences: and my ſelf, who have thus long been in ſearch after the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Eloquence,</hi> without finding among us any, which is not either counterfeit, or imperfect, am very confident you will bring it to light in the ſame excellency as it was, when at <hi>Rome</hi> the Tyrants were condemned, and when it defended the oppreſſed Provinces. Though Purple be very refulgent, yet will it receive a farther luſter by this your dignity, carrying command where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it cometh; and which is particularly ſo proper for the conduct of

So as (my Lord) thoſe who tearmed us <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and by their treaties commonly took revenge of our victories, have in the end found <hi>wiſdom</hi> on this ſide the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and have well perceived there is a man, who hath abilities to hinder them from deceiving others. They ſtood amazed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſee a Servant, who would not ſuffer there ſhould be any Maſter greater than his Sovereign. Who was as ſenſible of the leaſt evils of his Countrey, as of his proper ſorrows, ſuppoſing himſelf to be wounded upon the leaſt apprehenſion, when any made ſhew of trenching upon the dignity of this Crown. But when they found you applied preſent remedies to all ſuch inconveniences as they objected; that you prevented the difficulties they offered to propoſe, that you dived into their Souls, drawing thence their cloſeſt intentions, and how at the firſt conference you made anſwer to what they reſerved for a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: Then it was indeed, when their <hi>Flegm</hi> was turned into <hi>Choler,</hi> and when you put their humane wiſdoms and politick Maxims to a ſtand. So as we ſee it is ſufficient onely to let <hi>Good</hi> appear, to cauſe it to be beloved: and truly if <hi>Reaſon</hi> had the like power over the <hi>Will,</hi> as it hath over the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> all thoſe <hi>Italians</hi> doubtleſs, who heard you ſpeak, had returned good <hi>French men,</hi> and the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> together with the ſecurity of her Princes, had been but one days work. Forreign Wars had been ended in your Chamber; nor ſhould we now have any more than one buſineſs upon us, and the Kings Forces had at this preſent been imployed onely in ſuppreſſing the Rebels of his own Kingdom. My Lord, I hope you are perſwaded (though I could not probably expect any ſlight occurrents from the place where you are) yet that I received theſe with much emotion and tranſport, it not being in my power to diſſemble my joy, when I underſtood how their Majeſties are not weary of your ſervice, and how after having tried divers Councels, it was in concluſion thought fit to follow yours, &amp; that you precede in the affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> by being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductour of the Fortune of <hi>France.</hi> Truely, of all exteriour content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there is not any whereof I am ſo ſenſible as of that. But on the other ſide, when I underſtand that your health is dayly aſſaulted, or threatned by ſome accident, that the Tranquility, your conſcience af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords you, hinders you not from having ill nights: And how amidſt the happy ſucceſſes befalling you, life it ſelf is notwithſtanding ſometimes tedious unto you; then indeed I muſt confeſs they touch me in the tendereſt part of my <hi>Soul.</hi> And whileſt the <hi>Court</hi> makes thouſands of feigned <hi>Proteſtations</hi> unto you; there is an <hi>Hermite</hi> ſome hundred leagues from you, who mourns for your maladies with unfeigned tears. I know not whether or no I may preſume to ſay, <hi>I love you:</hi> yet is it not probable you will take offence at a word, wherewith you know <hi>God

himſelf</hi> is well pleaſed. <hi>My Lord;</hi> I do in ſuch manner love you, as I am either ſick upon the relation of your indiſpoſition; or if the news be current that you are recovered, yet have I ſtill an apprehenſion of what alteration each <hi>hour</hi> may bring upon you. Ought it then to be in the fits of your <hi>Feaver,</hi> and in your inquietude for want of ſleep, that you underſtand theſe publick <hi>acclamations,</hi> and the due <hi>praiſes</hi> you have purchaſed: Shall the <hi>Senſes</hi> ſuffer, and the <hi>Spirits</hi> rejoyce, or they continue tortured amidſt theſe Triumphs, or that you (at once) perform two contrary actions, and at the ſame time have need, as well of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as patience: If <hi>Virtue</hi> could be miſerable, or if that Sect, which acknowledgeth no other evil, but pain; nor any greater good than plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, had not been generally condemned, the Divine providence had received complaints from all parts of this Kingdom; nor had there been an honeſt man known, who for your ſake had not found ſomething farther to be deſired in the conduct of this World. But (my Lord) you underſtand much better than I do, that it is onely touching the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of beaſts, we are to believe the body, and not concerning ours, reſiding onely in the ſupreme part of our ſelves, and which is as ſmally ſenſible of thoſe diſorders committed below her, as thoſe in <hi>Heaven</hi> can be offended by the tempeſts of the <hi>Air,</hi> or vapours of the <hi>Earth.</hi> This being true: God forbid, that by the eſtate of your preſent conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, I ſhould judge of that of your condition; or that I ſhould not eſteem him perfectly happy, who is ſuperlatively wiſe. You may pleaſe to conſider, that howbeit you have ſhared with other men the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of humane nature, yet the advantage reſteth ſoly on your ſide: ſince (upon the matter) there is onely ſome ſmall pain remaining with you, inſtead of an infinity of errours, paſſions, and faults falling to our lots. Beſides, I am confident that the term of your ſufferings is well nigh expired, &amp; that the times hereafter prepares right ſolide and pure contentments for you, and a youth after its ſeaſon, as you are become old before your time. The King, who hath uſe of your long living, makes no unprofitable wiſhes: <hi>Heaven</hi> hears not the prayers that the Enemies of this State offer. We know no ſucceſſour that is able to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect what you have not yet finiſhed: and it being true, that our Forces are but the Arms of your head, and that your Counſels have been choſen by <hi>God</hi> to re-eſtabliſh the affairs of this age: we ought not to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of a loſs, which ſhould not happen but to our ſucceſſours. It ſhall then be in your time (my Lord, I hope) that oppreſſed Nations will come from the Worlds end to implore the protection of this Crown: that by your means our Allies will repair their loſſes, and that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſhall not be the ſole Conquerour, but that we ſhall prove the Infranchizers of the whole earth. In your time (I truſt) the <hi>Holy Sea</hi> ſhall have her opinions free, nor ſhall the inſpirations of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> be oppugned by the artifice of our Enemies, reſolutions will
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:120345:19"/>
be raiſed worthy the ancient <hi>Italy</hi> for defence of the common cauſe. To conclude, it will be through your <hi>Prudence</hi> (my Lord) that there ſhall no longer be any Rebellion among us, or Tyranny among men: that all the Cities of this Kingdom ſhall be ſeats of aſſurance for honeſt men; that novelties ſhall be no farther in requeſt; ſave onely for colours and faſhions of Attire: that the people will reſign Liberty, Religion, and the Common-wealth, into the hands of ſuperiours, and that out of law-full government, and loyall obedience, there will ariſe that felicity <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians</hi> ſearch after, as being the end of civile life. My hope is (my Lord) that all this will happen under your ſage conduct, and that after you have ſetled our repoſe, and procured the ſame for our Allies, you ſhall enjoy your good deeds in great tranquility, and ſee the eſtate of thoſe things endure, whereof your ſelf have been a principal Authour. All good men are confident theſe bleſſed events will happen in your age, and by your advice. As for me, who am the meaneſt among thoſe, who juſtly admire your <hi>Virtues,</hi> I ſhall not (I hope) prove the ſlackeſt in the expreſſion of your <hi>Merits:</hi> Since therefore they (of right) exact a general acknowledgement; if I ſhould fail in my particular contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I were for ever unworthy the <hi>Honour</hi> I ſo ambitiouſly aſpire unto; the heighth whereof is to be eſteemed,</p>

What can there be ſo pleaſing in the place where you are, that ſhould deſerve to ſtay you there? In fair weather the Sun is dangerous: half the year they breath nothing but <hi>ſmoak,</hi> and in the reſt, it raineth ſo frequently, that it ſeemeth ſome Sea hangeth over the Citie of <hi>Rome.</hi> But it may be you take pleaſure in ſeeing the <hi>Pope,</hi> a body over ſhaken, and trembling with <hi>age</hi> and <hi>infirmities,</hi> who hath no other thing than <hi>Ice</hi> in his <hi>veins,</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> in his <hi>Viſage.</hi> I cannot imagine how this object can afford you any great contentment; or that you are much taken with the ſociety and Company of the great multitude of my Lords his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, partaking of the one and the other ſignature: Nor can it be <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riofile</hi> whom you ſo often over-rule, who ſhould intreat you to ſtay there for the furtherance of his affairs.

acknowledgement. I am here at the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> where there is not any thing but <hi>Air,</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> and a <hi>River;</hi> One had here need make above ten days journeys to finde a man: wherefore having in this place no other communication but with the dead, I can relate no other news unto you, but of the other <hi>World.</hi> Is it not true, that he, who would have burnt his ſhirt, had it known his ſecrets, would hardly have been drawn to make his general confeſſion? and that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great would with much difficulty have been induced to purchaſe <hi>Paradiſe</hi> by <hi>humility?</hi> What ſay you of poor <hi>Brutus?</hi> who killed his Father, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to confound a Tyrant, and no leſs to repent himſelf at his death, in having loved <hi>Virtue,</hi> than if he had followed an unfaithfull Miſtreſs. Do you not yet remember the firſt Conſels, whoſe words ſmelt of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and green roaſted meat? think you not they made uſe of their hands inſtead of feet, being rough and durty as they were, and wore <hi>Shooes</hi> inſtead of <hi>Gloves?</hi> Theſe men were not acquainted either with <hi>Sugar, Musk,</hi> or <hi>Amber-greice.</hi> They had not (as then) any <hi>gods</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> or <hi>Goblets</hi> of <hi>Silver.</hi> They were ignorant in all ſorts of <hi>ſciences,</hi> ſave onely to make <hi>War,</hi> and to have domination over men. I lately read how in <hi>Venice</hi> (in former times) men of greateſt quality, uſually married with common women, and that either the good Husbandry, or the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual correſpondency was ſuch among the Citizens, that one Wife ſerved three brothers.

                     <p>THeſe times are fatal, for abating thoſe heads appearing above others, and for changing the face of things: and queſtionleſs, if this courſe ſtill continue, the King will either be forced to ſeek out a new people, or to reſolve himſelf for a ſolitary Reign: All the <hi>Court</hi> is black with mournings: there is not a <hi>French-man</hi> who doth not either weep, or is bewailed; and <hi>War</hi> cauſeth onely ſlight ſorrows; yet even among thoſe, whoſe loſs we lament, there are always ſome we willingly leave, and whoſe <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> may ſerve us as a conſolation for the reſt. Without further ambiguity, the man is ſeized on, who grew lean by the well-fare of others, and who was one of thoſe pale and ſober perſons, born for the <hi>Ruine</hi> of <hi>States;</hi> there is ſome appearance he died as well of the Purples of <hi>M.

Howſoever it be, we are herein to acknowledge the <hi>finger of God,</hi> and to confeſs, he doth ſometimes puniſh Malefactours, without obſerving the forms of <hi>Juſtice;</hi> at leaſt it cannot be denied, but <hi>God</hi> loveth the <hi>Queen</hi> extraordinarily, ſince he reſerveth to himſelf the revenge of all her injuries, nor will let any thing remain in the World, which may prove diſtaſtefull unto her.

                     <p>I Am infinitely glad to underſtand by your <hi>Letters,</hi> of your ſafe return into <hi>France,</hi> and that you have now no further uſe of <hi>Cyphers,</hi> for the expreſſion of your minde to my Lord, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Richelieu.</hi> I ſhall at your pleaſure (I hope) underſtand the particulars of your <hi>Voyage,</hi> and what you have ſeen at <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> worthy your content. This is not out of any great curioſity I have for theſe things, or that I admire dumbe Marble, or Pictures being no way ſo beautifull as the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</hi> Theſe trifles are to be left for the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> with whom the ſame Objects limit their imagination and ſight: and who (of all times) reflect, meerly upon the preſent, and (of all things) onely upon the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: but for my part I am of a contrary opinion. There are not in the whole World any Palaces ſo ſumptuous, or of ſo high a ſtructure, which are not far under my thoughts, and I conceive in my ſpirit a poor her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage, to the foundation whereof many more materials are projected, than were requiſite for eſtabliſhing a <hi>Republick.</hi> You ſee here, my Lord, how in ſome ſort I play the Prince amidſt my <hi>poverty,</hi> and with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency I ſcorn, what the <hi>World</hi> ſo much admireth; I am as haughty, as though I were a Miniſter of State, or as if this laſt change in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had been made for me alone: yet you know well, that I call not my ſelf <hi>L.M.D.L.V.</hi> and how if there had been none but my ſelf to aſſault,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:120345:22"/>
my Lord the Comte of <hi>Schambergs</hi> Virtue, it ſtill had continued in the ſame place where it hath been reverenced of all men. Each man hath his ſeveral cenſure concerning this great news, but whatſoever they can ſay, I aſſure my ſelf there can nothing befall that Lord, whereto he is not at all times prepared, and that he hath lived too long, not to know that <hi>Fortune,</hi> taketh ſpecial delight in dallying with the affairs of <hi>France,</hi> and hath from all Ages made choice of our <hi>Court,</hi> as the <hi>Theater</hi> of her follies. If he had not been provided of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this Citie, and what time the King commanded him to come thence, his fall had been more fearfull then it was, but it is Gods will that <hi>Augoleſme</hi> ſhould be the fatal retreat of the afflicted, and truely all things well conſidered, it is no great down-come to light upon a Mountain: Now truely if there be any thing amiſs in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Kings monies, he cannot be taxed for introducing this errour; for he found it there: and beſides, the neceſſity of the times have ever reſiſted his good intentions, and have hindred the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of what he had in his heart, for the reformation of diſorders; It is now neceſſary the King undertake ſo glorious a deſign, and ſet his hand to that part of the State, which hath more need of redreſs than all the reſt. But, he is firſt to begin by the moderation of his Spirit, and he ſhall after gain their loyalty, who ſerve him. If thoſe Princes our Elders have ſeen, had conſidered, that the Coyn coming into their <hi>Exchecquers,</hi> was no leſs than the bloud, and tears of their poor Subjects, whom they have often forced to fly into Forreſts, and paſs the Seas to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Taxes and impoſitions: they would have been more ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and cautelous how they had touched upon ſo dreadfull underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings: at leaſt, they would not have been at once both indigent and unjuſt, nor have amazed all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> who could never conceive why they borrowed their own moneys of their <hi>Treaſurers,</hi> who receive their revenews, as they purchaſe their own ſtrong places from their <hi>Governours,</hi> who command therein. Truely, it is very ſtrange the <hi>Great Turk</hi> can intruſt his <hi>Wives</hi> to the vigilancy of others, and aſſure themſelves their Chaſtity ſhall thereby be conſerved; yet, that Kings know not to whom they may ſafely encharge their Treaſures. But the true reaſon is, for that an honeſt man is by ſo much more difficultly found, then an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> by how much Miracles are more rare than Monſters. Great Fortitude is requiſite for the attaining of honeſty, but the will onely ſufficeth to become covetous, and the moſt harmleſs have hands, and may happen to have temptations. Were it my part to play the reformer, and to preach before the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, I would enlarge my ſelf upon this <hi>Subject,</hi> but in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein I ſtand, it is ſufficient I approve not the ill, and have a good opinion of the preſent State: provided, the report be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:120345:22"/>
that there is now no obſtacle between the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Queen</hi> his <hi>Mother,</hi> likely to hinder them from meeting; and that things are reduced to thoſe terms, wherein <hi>Nature</hi> hath placed them: Then will the face of the State ſhortly reſume the ſame beauty the late <hi>King</hi> beſtowed thereon, and God will with a full hand pour his <hi>Graces</hi> upon ſo juſt a Government. Though my Lord the Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu</hi> were onely near publick affairs, without touching them, there is no queſtion but he would bring a bleſſing to all <hi>France,</hi> and though he intimated nothing to the <hi>King,</hi> yet that he would at leaſt inſpire whatſoever were neceſſary for the good of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and Dignity of his Crown. I will reſerve to ſpeak as I ought of this rare <hi>Virtue,</hi> till my great <hi>Work</hi> come to light. Where I will render every man his right, and condemn even thoſe as culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whom the Parliaments crouch unto; There ſhall it be where I will canvaſs the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> (which I always ſeparate from the <hi>Church</hi>) with as much force, and freedom as he uſed, from whoſe mouth we have ſeen <hi>lightning</hi> to iſſue, and <hi>Thunder</hi> to be thrown out. There is not any thing of ſo fair aſſemblance, whoſe <hi>deformities</hi> I unmaſk not. There is nothing of <hi>eminencie</hi> from one end of the <hi>World</hi> to the other, I over-turn not. I will diſcover the <hi>defects</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States.</hi> I will expugne <hi>Vice</hi> whereſoever it is hidden, and with what <hi>Protection</hi> ſoever it is palliated. To conclude, I will paſs as ſevere a <hi>Judgement</hi> as was that of the <hi>Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagites</hi> in times paſt, or of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> at this preſent. Yet, my Lord, in this my common cenſure, I will take a particular care of the <hi>Queen Mothers</hi> reputation, and will let all the <hi>World</hi> ſee, that what heretofore others have called <hi>Virtue,</hi> is the natural habitude of this great <hi>Princeſs.</hi> In the place for others appointed for <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions</hi> and <hi>Calamities, She</hi> ſhall together with the King, receive onely <hi>Flowers</hi> and <hi>Crowns;</hi> and as <hi>her innocencie</hi> had ſaved her from the <hi>general deluge,</hi> had <hi>ſhe</hi> then lived; ſo will it cauſe her to Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in my <hi>Story</hi> amidſt the ruins of others. I have not the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of <hi>Flattering,</hi> but the <hi>Art</hi> onely to ſpeak the <hi>Truth</hi> in good terms; and the <hi>Actions</hi> you ſee, had need be more eminent than thoſe you have read of, if I equal them not by my <hi>Words.</hi> This being thus (my Lord, as I hope, you doubt not;) imagine in what terms I will Juſtifie the <hi>R. D. L. R.</hi> and in what ſort I will intreat <hi>her</hi> Enemies: if I have a minde to it, I will make it one day appear that <hi>C. C.</hi> hath been as cruel a <hi>Monſter</hi> as thoſe who devour whole <hi>Cities,</hi> and denounce <hi>War</hi> againſt all <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> things. One will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine by the marks I give him, that <hi>R.</hi> was a <hi>Magician,</hi> which dayly pricked ſome <hi>Image</hi> of Wax with needles, and who diſturbed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all <hi>Princes</hi> Courts of his time by the force of his Charms.

The truth is, I will do great matters, provided my <hi>courage</hi> quail not on his part, whence I expect it ſhould come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to whom, by a kinde of ſtrict Obligation, I am excited to undertake this <hi>Judgement,</hi> which will be no leſs famous than that of <hi>Michael Angelo.</hi> At our next meeting I will more particularly acquaint you with the whole deſign of my <hi>work,</hi> with its <hi>order, ornaments,</hi> and <hi>artifice;</hi> you ſhall there ſee whether or no I make good uſe of thoſe hours I ſometimes obtain from the Tyranny of my <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> and lingring Maladies.

                     <p>YOu cannot looſe me, how little care ſoever you take to keep me; The <hi>Heavens</hi> muſt neceſſarily infuſe new affections in me, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly alter my inclinations, if they intend to inhibite me to be your ſervant. Yet doth it not a little grieve me, you do not teſtifie what I know you believe; and that having the power to make me happy by the leaſt of your <hi>Letters,</hi> I have more trouble to impetrate this favour, than I ſhould finde in the obtaining of three Declarations from the <hi>King,</hi> and as many Briefs from his Holineſs. But all this notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I cannot be perſwaded you place me among matters of meer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, or that you no longer remember what you have promiſed with ſo large proteſtations, which I hold to be moſt Authentical. I rather, for the ſatisfaction of my thoughts, will be confident you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to love me in ſecret, thereby to avoid all jealouſie; and will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is more cunning, than coldneſs in your ſilence; were it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, had I really loſt your Favours, certainly I would not ſurvive ſo deep a diſcomfort, ſince there is not any baniſhment, ſhipwrack, or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter fortune, I could not rather require at <hi>Gods</hi> hands, than ſuch a loſs: But theſe diſcourſes are as much as to ſuppoſe impoſſibilities, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent dreams: I will therefore leave them, to let you underſtand ſome news from me.

Yet (my Lord) even in this bad ſtate wherein I now ſtand, do I expect a Miracle from my <hi>Maker,</hi> who is onely able to raiſe Children out of the hardeſt Quarries; nor will I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his mercie hath finiſhed what he intendeth to effect for the good of Mortals: For ſince he hath placed Ports upon the ſhoars of moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Seas, and given ſome kinde of dawning, even to the darkeſt nights; it may be there is yet ſomething reſerved for me in the ſecrets of his <hi>Providence;</hi> and that if hitherto I have ranged out of the right way, he will not any longer ſuffer me to ſtray, or tire my ſelf in the track of <hi>vice.</hi> And truely, I muſt here, though much to my ſhame, acknowledge the truth unto you, with thoſe few drops of corrupt bloud (which is all I have left) I am plunged in all thoſe paſſions, wherewith the ſoundeſt bodies are preſſed: yea, Tyrants, who burn whole Cities upon the firſt motion of rage, and choller, and who allow themſelves to act what unlawfull thing ſoever, do nothing more than my ſelf, ſave onely to enjoy thoſe things I deſire, and to execute thoſe deſigns re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining onely in my will, I wanting their power to perpetrate the like: Nor can the <hi>Feaver,</hi> the <hi>Stone,</hi> nor the <hi>Scytica,</hi> as yet tame my rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious ſpirit, or cauſe it to become capable of Diſcipline; and if time had added years to the reſt of my infirmities, I verily think I ſhould deſire to behold unclean ſights with ſpectacles, ſuch I mean as you ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly avoid, and cauſe my ſelf to be carried to thoſe lewd places, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone I were unable to go: Inſomuch that as there are divers paintings which are neceſſarily to be clean defaced, to take away the defects; So I much fear, nothing but <hi>Death</hi> can ſtay the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of my crimes, unleſs by your means I enter into a ſecond life, more fruithfull than the former. I therefore ſpeak in good ſadneſs, ſet your whole Clergie to prayer, and command a publick Faſt in the

ſame ſtrictneſs, as though you were to impetrate at the hands of <hi>God,</hi> the converſion of the great <hi>Turk,</hi> or of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Emperour. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to your ſelf Monſters in my will to be maſtred, and an infinity of Enemies to overcome in my paſſions, and after all this you will bear me witneſs, I have not made matters greater then they are, and ſave onely a certain imperfect deſire I have to repent, and a kinde of ſmall reſiſtance, I ſometimes make againſt the beginnings and buddings of <hi>vice,</hi> there is not any difference at all between my ſelf and the greateſt ſinnet living: But take not (I beſeech you) this I write, as a mark of my humility, for you never read a truer relation: and what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake in the perſon of <hi>Mankinde,</hi> accuſing himſelf of other mens offences, is my own ſimple diſpoſition, which I deliver into the hands of the <hi>Divine Juſtice.</hi> I hate my ſelf; yet true it is, I finde ſo great coldneſs in the performance of pious actions, that my minde ſeemeth to be impriſoned when at any time my duty draweth me to <hi>Church,</hi> and when I am there, I rather ſeek diverſions and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then inſtruction or edification: Even mental prayer being an Oblation for all hours, and which may be performed without either burnt <hi>Incenſe,</hi> or <hi>bloudy Sacrifices,</hi> and the finiſhing whereof is ſo near the firſt motion; is to me as laborious, as the Pilgrimage of Mount <hi>Serrat,</hi> or of our Lady of <hi>Loretta,</hi> would be to another. I am always ſad, but never penitent; I love ſolitarineſs, but hate auſterity; I ſide with honeſt men, but reſide with the wicked: if at any time ſome ſmall rays of Devotion reflect upon my crazy conſcience, they are of ſo ſhort continuance, and ſo weak, as they neither afford me light nor heat, ſo as all this being but accident, and meer change, doth not any way merit the name of <hi>good,</hi> and it were great wrong to <hi>Virtue,</hi> to rank it in the number of caſual occurrents. You are therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to labour for my converſion, which I am unable to effect of my ſelf, and that for my part, I onely affoord matter whereon to make an honeſt man. If there be certain Saints whom we owe to the tears and interceſſion of others, and if ſome Martyrs have made their very Executioners Companions of their <hi>Glorie,</hi> I may well hope you will be a powerfull means to ſave me with your ſelf; and that one day (happily) I may be mentioned among the reſt of your Miracles. Sir, I know your life to be ſo ſpotleſs, as though you were incorporeal, or never loved any other than that Supream beauty, from whence all others are derived: Wherefore there is no queſtion but ſo rare a <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> may eaſily impetrate at <hi>Gods</hi> hands any ſupplication you ſhall exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, nor is there any doubt he hath (for you allotted) other limits to his bounty, ſave his onely omnipotency.

So far as I can learn, or if the report which paſſeth be current, he had a conceit he might one day prove to be that falſe Prophet, wherewith the declining age of the <hi>Church</hi> is threatned: and though he be but of mean extraction, and poor fortunes, he was notwithſtanding ſo preſumptuous, as to imagine himſelf to be the man, who is to come with armed forces to diſturb the quiet of conſciences, and for whom the infernal Miniſters keep all the Treaſures yet hidden in the earths entrails. So long as he contented himſelf in committing onely humane faults, writing as yet with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted <hi>Pen,</hi> I often told him, his <hi>Verſes</hi> were not paſſable; and that he was in the wrong to eſteem himſelf an underſtanding man.

                     <p>YEſterday was one of thoſe Sunleſs days (as you tearm them) which reſemble that beautifull blinde <hi>Maid,</hi> wherewith <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond fell in Love. Truely, I never took more pleaſure in ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate a ſolitarineſs; and though I walked in a large and open plain, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of man could make no other uſe, but for two Armies to fight in: yet the ſhade the <hi>Heavens</hi> caſt on all ſides, cauſed me little to regard the ſhelter of Caves, or Forreſts. There was a general and quiet calm from the higheſt Region of the <hi>Air,</hi> even to the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the <hi>Earth:</hi> the waters of Rivers ſeemed as even and ſmooth as thoſe of Lakes; and ſurely; if at Sea ſuch a calm ſhould for ever ſurpriſe ſhips, they could never be either ſafe, or ſunk. This I ſay, on purpoſe to make you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent the loſs of ſo a pleaſant a day, for not coming abroad out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as alſo to draw you ſometimes out of your <hi>Angouleſme,</hi> where you tread levil with our Towers and Steeples, to come and take part of thoſe pleaſures wherein the ancient Princes of the <hi>World</hi> took delight: who uſually refreſhed themſelves in Fountains, and lived on thoſe fruits which Forreſts affoord. Your friends are here in a ſmall circle environed with Mountains, and where is yet remaining ſome few grains of that fair Gold whereof the <hi>first Age</hi> was compoſed. In truth, when the fire of War is flaming in the four corners of <hi>France,</hi> and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a hundred paces hence, the whole Earth is covered with adverſe Troups and Armies; they with mutual conſent do always ſpare our Village. The Spring-time in other places producing the beſiegings of Forts and Cities, with other enterpriſes of War, and which for this dozen years hath been leſs looked for, in reſpect of the change of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, then for any alteration of Affairs, ſuffers us to ſee no other thing but <hi>Violets</hi> and <hi>Roſes.</hi> Our people are not contained in their primative innocencie, either by fear of Laws, or Study of Sciences: They
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:120345:26"/>
(to live uprightly) do ſimply follow their natural <hi>Bounty,</hi> and draw more advantage from their ignorance of <hi>Vice,</hi> then moſt of us do out of the knowledge of <hi>Virtue:</hi> ſo as in this Territorie of two miles, they know not how to coſen any, ſave <hi>Birds</hi> and <hi>Beaſts,</hi> and the pleading Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is as unknown here, as that of <hi>America,</hi> or of other parts of the World, which have eſcaped the avarice of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Iſabella.</hi> Thoſe things which hurt the health of man, or offend their eys, are generally baniſhed hence; <hi>Snakes</hi> nor <hi>Lizards</hi> are never ſeen here, and of creeping creatures we know no other but <hi>Mellons</hi> and <hi>Strawberries.</hi> I intend not here to draw you the portrait of a palace, the workmanſhip whereof hath not been ordered according to the rules of architecture, nor the matter ſo precious as Marble and Purphire. I will onely tell you that at the Gates there is a Grove, wherein at full noon there enters no more day than needs muſt not to make it night, and to cauſe all colours not to look black: ſo that between the Sun and the ſhade, there is a kinde of third temper compoſed, which may well be endured by the weakeſt eys, and hide the deformities of painted faces. The Trees here, are green to the very ground, as well with their own leaves, as with Juy which invirons them: and as for the fruites where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are deficient, their branches are all beſet with Turtle-Doves and Pheſants, and this at all times in the year. From thence I march into a Meddow, where I tread upon Tulipans and Anemons, having cauſed them to be mingled among other Flowers, to confirm my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I brought from my Travails, that <hi>French</hi> flowers are not ſo fair, as thoſe of Forreign Countreys. I (ſometimes walk down into that Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, being the ſecret part of my Deſert, and which till now) was not known to any man: It is a Countrey to be wiſhed for and painted. I have made choice thereof for my moſt precious occupations, there to paſs the moſt pleaſing hours of my life: The Trees and water ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer this place to want couldneſs and verdure. The Swans which covered the whole River, are retired to this place of ſecurity: living in a Channel, which cauſeth the greateſt talkers to take a nap, ſo ſoon as they come near; and on whoſe Banks I am always happy; be I merry, or melancholly: How ſhort a time ſoever I ſtay there, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I enter into my firſt innocency: my deſires, my fears and hopes ſtop in a trice: all the motions of my Soul ſlacken, nor have I any paſſions remaining, or if I have any, I govern them as tame beaſts. The Sun conveys its light thither, but never its heat. The place is ſo low, as it can onely receive the laſt points of its beams: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore the more beautifull, in that they are leſs burning, and the light thereof altogether pure. But as it is my ſelf who have diſcovered this new found Land; ſo do I poſſeſs it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any partner, nor would I ſhare it with my own Brother.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:120345:27"/>
But in all other quarters under my command, there is not a man who Courts not his Miſtreſs without controul, nor ſervant of mine who is not Maſter; each one ſatisfying himſelf of what he loves, and ſpending the time at pleaſure. And on the other ſide, when I ſee the Graſs trodden down; and on the other the Corn full of Layers: I am well aſſured, it is neither Winde nor Hail, hath made this work, but onely a Shepheard and his ſweet-heart. At which door ſoever I go out of my houſe, or on what ſide ſoever I turn mine eys, in this pleaſant <hi>Pathmos,</hi> I finde the River of <hi>Charanton</hi> well meriting as much fame, as that of <hi>Tagus,</hi> and wherein, when the Beaſts go to drink, they ſee the Heavens as clear as we do, and enjoy the ſame advantage, which elſewhere men have over them. Beſides, this pure water is ſo in love with this petty Province, that it divides it ſelf into a thouſand branches, and makes an infinite of windings and turnings, as loath to leave and deprive it ſelf of ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a lodging; and when at any time it over-floweth, it is onely to make the year more fertile, and to affoord us means to catch Trouts and Pikes, leaving them upon the levil; and which are ſo great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as they equal the Sea-Monſters; the Crocadiles of <hi>Nile,</hi> and all the ſuppoſed Gold rowling in thoſe feigned Rivers, ſo much ſpoken of by <hi>Poets.</hi> The great Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> comes hether ſometimes for change of felicity, and to lay aſide that auſtere virtue and ſplendour, which dazeleth the eys of all men, to aſſume milder qualities, and a more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtable Majeſty. This Cardinal likewiſe, by whom Heaven intends to act ſo high deſigns, and of whom you hear me dayly ſpeak, after the loſs of his brother, who was ſuch a one, as if he might have choſen him among all men, he would not have taken any other: after (as I ſay) having indured that loſs, well deſerving to draw tears from the Queen, he made choice of this place, here to exerciſe his patience, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from Gods hands, who loveth ſilence, and who is found in ſolitary retirements, what Phyloſophy affoordeth not, nor is to be practiſed among the throng of people. I would enlarge my ſelf upon other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, to ſhew you how my Village hath at all times been frequented by Heroical <hi>Hermits,</hi> and how the ſteps of Princes and great Siegniours, art (as yet) newly trodden in my ordinary paths. But the more to envite you to come hither; I ſuppoſe it ſufficient to ſay, that <hi>Virgil</hi> and my ſelf do here attend you: if therefore you be accompanied in this Voyage with your <hi>Muſes;</hi> and other <hi>Manuſcripts,</hi> we ſhall not need to intertain the time with Court news, nor with the <hi>Germain</hi> troubles. Let me not live, if ever I ſaw any thing comparable to your <hi>Spiritual Meditations,</hi> and if the leaſt part of the work you ſhewed me, be not of more worth than all <hi>Frankford Mart,</hi> and all thoſe great Books which come to us from the North, bringing cold weather and Froſts along with them. I aſſure you the Preſident of <hi>THOU,</hi> who was as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:120345:27"/>
a Judge of <hi>Latine Eloquence,</hi> as of the life and Fortunes of men; and who had left an exact Hiſtory behinde him, had he pleaſed to retract ſome things; made no ſmall eſteem of theſe my Countrey-men: But I cannot as yet conceive what cauſed him to affect certain wits ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his own, and who never were acquainted, nor did ſo much as dream of that <hi>Roman</hi> purity, you purſue with ſo great ſcrupuloſity and exact diligence. You will let theſe men ſee I aſſure my ſelf; yea, and thoſe wiſe <hi>Tranſalpines</hi> themſelves likewiſe, who think all ſuch to be <hi>Scythians</hi> who are not <hi>Italians,</hi> even in what faſhion they ſpake in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> his age; yea, and in a time more clear from the corruption of good cuſtoms. In a word, beſides the propriety of terms, and chaſtity of ſtile, which lendeth a luſter to your elaborate writings, your conceits are ſo ſublime, and ſo full of courage, that it is very probable the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Republick of <hi>Rome</hi> was adorned with the like, at what time it was victorious over the world, and when the <hi>Senate</hi> conceived inſemblable terms, the Commandments they preſcribed to greateſt Princes, and the anſwers it addreſſed to all Nations on earth: I will ſpeak further, when you appear where I expect you; and where inſtead of <hi>Flowers, Fruits,</hi> and <hi>Shades,</hi> which I prepare for you, I hope to receive from you all the riches of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Nature.</hi> In the interim (to uſe my Lord the <hi>Cardinal d'Oſſats</hi> term) I bid you good night, and let you know, that if you ſeek excuſes not to come, I am no longer</p>

                     <p>I Was upon the point not to have written any more unto you, and to have contented my ſelf in ſending you ſingle commendations, ſince I ſee my Letters procure you Enemies: and for that you are in dayly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation for defending them; if therefore you deſire continuance of our conference in this kinde, live hence-forward repoſedly, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile your ſelf to choice wits, from whom I ſhould be ſorry you ſhould ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate your ſelf for my ſake; it is far better to conceal a ſmall truth, than to diſturb a general peace; and I ſhould hold my Eloquence as pernicious as the perfections of <hi>Helena,</hi> ſhould it prove any cauſe of your quarrels. Since there have been found men who have carped at
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:120345:28"/>
the Worlds compoſure, and ſpied ſpots in the Sun, it is very likely inferiour things cannot be more perfect; and that there is nothing ſo abſolutely approved, againſt which there hath not been ſome thing diſputed, and certain weak reaſons alleadged. I confeſs I write as men build Temples and Pallaces, and that I ſometimes fetch my Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials a far off, as we are to make a voyage of two thouſand Leagues, to tranſport the Treaſures of <hi>America</hi> into <hi>Spain.</hi> But if Pearls be not precious becauſe they grow not in the ſands of <hi>Seine;</hi> or if in what I do, ſome condemn me, it ſufficeth that I am not of their minde; if the worſt come, I appeal to my Lord the Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> of whoſe approbation I eſteem more, than of popular favour, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of Theaters. It is long ſince I underſtood from him that I exceeded others, not excepting even thoſe who ſtrive to aſpire to a kinde of Tyranny, and to uſurp a more abſolute Authority over wits, than is either lawfull, or reaſonable. This being ſo, I ſhould much wrong that great perſon, on whoſe books God hath placed the Truth we ſeek after, as well as the Eloquence all of us imagine we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſhould I digreſs from his opinion, to regard what four or five of thoſe compoſers of <hi>Romand</hi> of the Roſe ſay, who have no other Language but <hi>Legends:</hi> if I would content my ſelf with my <hi>Infant</hi> conceptions, or determined to write as an honeſt Woman ſhould ſpeak, they would happily finde their own facility in my <hi>Works:</hi> though truely, if I take any pains therein, I aſſure my ſelf they will ſooner gueſs at, then gain my conceptions. But truely, he who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth to himſelf the <hi>Idea</hi> of perfection, and who labours for <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> ought not to let any thing eſcape his <hi>Pen,</hi> till after long and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſultation with himſelf. Yet will I tell you, and all the World may eaſily underſtand, that my writings ſmell more of <hi>Musk</hi> and <hi>Amber,</hi> than of <hi>Oyl,</hi> or <hi>ſweat;</hi> whereas out of that great labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs they ſo much frame to themſelves, there will infallibly ariſe obſcurity, which none but the <hi>Blinde</hi> can tax me with. But as for thoſe fellows, it is always night with them, and they are rather to accuſe their Mothers of their defects, and not colours, or the light: I indeavour (in what I <hi>may</hi>) to make all my conceptions popular, and to be intelligible among Women and Children, even when I ſpeak of things beyond their Capacity: but if your friends ſuppoſe certain of my conceits to be over-far fetcht, let them throughly obſerve, whether they tranſcend my ſubject, or their conceptions; or whither I go aſtray, or they looſe ſight of me: There are divers things above reaſon, which yet are not contrary thereto. An Heroical virtue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of exceſſes and heighth of paſſions, goeth as far beyond vulgar <hi>Virtue,</hi> as it ſurmounteth <hi>Vice:</hi> we are not therefore to ſhut up all <hi>Wits</hi> within the ſame limits, nor preſently to cenſure that as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:120345:28"/>
which is onely extraordinary: Otherwiſe we ſhould reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that poor <hi>Norvegian,</hi> who the firſt time he ſaw <hi>Roſes,</hi> durſt not touch them for fear of burning his fingers, and was much amazed to ſee (as he ſuppoſed,) Trees to bear <hi>fire:</hi> Surely as Novelty is not of force to make Monſters well featured, ſo ought it not to hinder our affections to excellent things, though unknown unto us. If for the underſtanding my language, it were neceſſary to learn two, or that <hi>Anxietie, Decrepitude,</hi> and the <hi>Irritaments</hi> of <hi>Despair,</hi> were familiar phraſes with me; if I made uſe of <hi>Waves</hi> inſtead of <hi>Water,</hi> and evil <hi>Fates</hi> for ill <hi>fortune,</hi> or the <hi>Flower-de-luce</hi> for <hi>France;</hi> to the end to play the <hi>Poet</hi> in <hi>Proſe;</hi> ſhould I immolate my ſelf to publick ſcorn, and ſail upon the <hi>Ocean</hi> in the ſtormical ſeaſons of the year, if I ſhould ſay, the <hi>Miſericordious Juſtice</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and his juſt <hi>Miſericord;</hi> or pluck compariſons from <hi>Plinie;</hi> and could I not commend a <hi>King</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and <hi>Plutarcks Worthies;</hi> if inſtead of well-ſpeaking, I ſhould tranſlate <hi>Tacitus</hi> ill, and if in ſpite of him I ſhould force him to deliver his opinion concerning all the affairs of this age, you then might rightly blame me from bringing follies ſo far off, and for taking ſo much pains to make my ſelf ridiculous. But ſurely I ſhould be the moſt innocent of all others, had I onely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended therein; and I may ſafely ſay without vanity, that even the follies of my <hi>Infancie,</hi> were more ſerious than thoſe ſweet <hi>Rhetorical flowers:</hi> when all is ſaid, ſince there is nothing but <hi>Religion</hi> can force us to believe what ſhe pleaſeth, and that <hi>Kings</hi> themſelves have no power over Souls, I am well ſatisfied with the affection of my friends, and do willingly leave their judgements free to themſelves. One <hi>Good-night</hi> is more worth than all our <hi>Eloquence,</hi> and not to know the miſeries of this life, is to be more learned than the <hi>Scorbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> For my part, (deſpiſing the World as I do) I cannot much eſteem my ſelf, who make up one of the ſicklieſt parts thereof; and I have ſo poor an opinion of my own ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as I little eſteem the <hi>Talents</hi> of others. Think not then, I adore the workmanſhip of my hands, though I take as much pains therein, as did the ancient Carvers in counterfeiting their <hi>gods.</hi> But contrariwiſe, it is the reaſon why I diſlike them, and had I been a man of ten thouſand Crowns rent, I would have given the half of it to a Secretary, onely to hire him not to indite thoſe <hi>Letters</hi> you have ſo much admired.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hilſt you imploy your hours in gaining hearts and Votes, and happily lay the foundation of ſome eminent enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize: I here enjoy a repoſedneſs not unlike that of the dead, and which is never rouzed but by <hi>Clorinda's</hi> kiſſes. If the Duke of <hi>Oſſuna</hi> be choſen King of <hi>Naples,</hi> (as you write the report runneth) I finde no ſtrangeneſs in it. The World is ſo old, and hath ſeen ſo much, it can hardly ſpie any new matter; nor is there at this day any lawfull Authority, whoſe Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin (for the moſt part) hath not been unjuſt. And on the other ſide the ill ſucceſs of revolts are far more frequent than are the changes of States: and the ſame action, which hath no leſs than a Diademe for the aim, hath often an ignominious death for its end. Howſoever this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, it ſhall not much trouble me, ſince the iſſue cannot be other than advantagious to this State. For God herein will either make it appear, that he is protector of Kings: or it falling out otherwiſe, yet at leaſt it will weaken the Enemies to this Crown. But I hope you will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe me to beat my brains upon thoſe politick conſiderations; for ſhould
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:120345:29"/>
I do ſo, it were no leſs than to retract the reſolution I had taken to look upon things paſſing among us and our neighbours, as I do on the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory <hi>Japon,</hi> or the affairs of another World. I ought to ſurrender this humour to vulgar ſpirits, who intereſt themſelves in all the quarrels of States and Princes, and who will always be parties, on purpoſe to put themſelves into choler, and be miſerable in the misfortunes of others. Truely we ſhall never have done, if we will needs take all the affairs of the World to heart, and be paſſionate for the publick; whereof we make but a ſmall part. It may be at this very inſtant wherein I write, the great <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet ſuffereth ſhipwrack within two leagues of Land: happily the great <hi>Turk</hi> hath ſurpriſed ſome Province from the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> and taken thence ſome twenty thouſand Souls, to convey them to their Cittie of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> It may be the Sea hath exceeded its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, and drowned ſome Cittie in <hi>Zealand.</hi> If we ſend for miſchiefs ſo far off, there will not an hour paſs, wherein ſome diſconſolation, or other will not come upon us. If we hold all the men in the World to be of our affinity, let us make account to wear Mournings all our life. As mine experience is not great, ſo are my years not many: yet ſince I came into the World, I have ſeen ſo many ſtrange accidents, and have underſtood from my Father ſuch ſtore of incredible occurrents, as I ſuppoſe there can nothing now happen, able to cauſe admiration in me. The Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth his Grand-child, born to the hopes of ſo many Kingdoms, was condemned to death, for having over-ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them. The natural ſubjects of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> do at this day diſpute with him for the Empire of the Sea; nor will they reſt ſatisfied with their uſurped liberty. Surely, we ſhould hardly be drawn to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve theſe things upon the credit of others, and thoſe in ſucceeding ages will with much difficulty be perſwaded to receive them for truths; yet are theſe the ordinary recreations of <hi>Fortune,</hi> taking pleaſure in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving <hi>Mankinde,</hi> by events far oppoſite to all appearance; yea, and contrary to their <hi>judgements.</hi> Hath ſhe not delivered over to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples fury, the man whom ſhe had formerly raiſed above the reſt, to the end, we ſhould not preſume in greateſt <hi>proſperities?</hi> And hath ſhe not at the ſame time taken out of the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> a Priſoner, to make him <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> of a Royal Army, thereby to oblige us not at any time to <hi>deſpair?</hi> I do here conſider all this with a repoſed <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and as <hi>Fables</hi> preſented on the <hi>Stage;</hi> or Pictures in a <hi>Gallery.</hi> Now ſince the late <hi>Comet</hi> had like to have been as fatal unto me, as to the Emperour <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> in that my curioſity to ſee it, cauſed me to riſe in my ſhirt, which gave me a cold all the <hi>Winter</hi> after, I am hereafter reſolved not to meddle with any thing above my reach; but to refer all to GOD and <hi>Nature.</hi> So as <hi>Clarinda</hi> ſuffer me to ſerve her, and that I underſtand from her own mouth that ſhe loves me, I will hearken to no other news, nor ſearch a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:120345:30"/>
ſecond Fortune. I therefore moſt humbly beſeech your Lordſhip to excuſe me, if upon theſe occaſions lately preſented, I cannot affoord you my perſonal attendance, or refuſe to follow you whither your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution leads you; my Miſtreſs having commanded me, to render her an account how I ſhed my bloud, and enjoyning me never to go the <hi>Wars,</hi> but when Muſkets are charged with <hi>Cypres powder;</hi> I am rather contented you ſhould accuſe me of Cowardize, than ſhe juſtly to charge me with diſobedience. And after all this, tell me whether, or no, you think me to be in my right wits, and that I have not loſt my reaſon, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the reſpect I owe you. I herein do as a Delinquent; who fearing he ſhould not be ſoon enough puniſhed, puts himſelf into the hands of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> not ſtaying either for the rack, or examination of <hi>Judges,</hi> for the diſcovery of a crime whereof he was never accuſed. I am well aſſured, that of all paſſions you have onely thoſe of Honour and Glory, &amp; that your Spirits are ſo repleniſhed therewith, as there is no place left either for love, hate, or fear. Yet do I withall conſider, that it is a part of a wiſe mans felicity to reflect upon other mens follies: howſoever, if any word hath eſcaped me, which may offend your eys, take it, I beſeech you, as a means ſent you from GOD for your farther mortification, in cauſing you to read things ſo diſtaſtefull unto you. You are neceſſarily to endure far greater croſſes amidſt the corruption of this Age: if you cannot live among the wicked, you muſt ſeek for another kinde of World than this, and for more perfect creatures than Mortals. There will ever be poyſnings beyond the <hi>Alps,</hi> Treaſons at <hi>Court,</hi> and revolts in this <hi>Realm.</hi> Howſoever (my Lord) there will be love even in ſpite of you, ſo long as there are eys and beauties in the World; yea, the Wiſe themſelves will love, if they finde <hi>Clorindaes, Dianaes,</hi> and <hi>Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra's</hi> to be beloved. Fire ſeizeth ſometimes on Churches and Palaces. <hi>God</hi> hath framed Fools and Phyloſophers of one and the ſame matter: And that cruel Sect which ſeeks to bereave us of the one half of our ſelves, in ſeeking to free us from our paſſions and affections, inſtead of making a wiſe man, have onely raiſed a Statue. I muſt therefore once again tell you that I love, ſince <hi>Nature</hi> will have it ſo; and that I am of the progeny of our firſt Parents: but I muſt withall inform you, that all my affections ſpring not from the diſtempers and diſeaſes of my Soul; my inclination to ſerve you, having immortal reaſon, not momentary pleaſure for its foundation, one day happily I ſhall no more be amorous, but will always remain</p>

                     <p>AT length they have done you right, and you now enjoy what you deſerved from the firſt day of your Nativity: if there could be any thing added to man, who reckoneth Kings among his Predeceſſors, and whoſe inclinations happily are over-great to live under the power of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; I ſhould adviſe you to rejoyce at this news; but being extracted as you are, from one of the moſt illuſtrious Origins on earth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by a Father, whoſe life is loaden with miracles; it ſufficeth that you pardon Fortune, ſince it hath ſo happened that preſent neceſſity hath gained of her what ſhe in right owed to your name. I know well that ſome will tell you, you are created Prince of ſuch an Eſtate, as is bounded neither by Seas nor Mountains, and how the extent of your Juriſdiction is ſo illimitable, as were there many Worlds, they ought all of them to depend thereon as well as this. But I, who ſuffer not mine eys to be dazeled by any other luſter than that of Virtue, and who do not ſo much as beſtow the looking on, what moſt men admire; if I ſhould eſteem you either more great, or happy than you were, I ſhould not have ſufficiently profited under you, in the true underſtanding of you. Doubtleſs in the opinion of the Vulgar, it is an extraordinary Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be a prime perſon in a Ceremony, and to wear a Hat of equal eſteem to Crowns and Diadems. Yet I preſume you will pardon me, if I make bold to tell you, it is an honour can never oblige a wiſe man to envy you. For had you this point onely above me, I ſhould ſtill be my own Maſter: Nor had I for your ſake renounced that liberty, which was as dear to me as the Common-wealth of <hi>Venice.</hi> Upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to have none other Judge on Earth ſave onely your reputation and conſcience, and to have a great train of followers, ſome whereof are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the procuring your ſpiritual pleaſures, others in the conduct of your temporal affairs, all this ſhall be ſtill the ſame with you, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others whom you ſlight; but to perform good and virtuous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when you are aſſured they ſhall never come to the Worlds eye; to fear nothing but diſhoneſt things; to believe death to be neither good nor bad in it ſelf; but that if the occaſion to imbrace it be honourable, it is always more valuable than a long life: to have the reputation of integrity in your promiſes, in a time, when the moſt credulous have enough to do to confide on publick Faith: This is it which I admire in you my Lord; and not your red Hat, and your fifty thouſand Crowns rent; yet I will ſay, that for the honour of <hi>Rome,</hi> you ought to eſteem of what ſhe ſends you. The time hath been when ſhe would have erected
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:120345:31"/>
Statues for you, and afforded you ſufficient ſubject to have merited Tryumphs: but thoſe days being paſt, and ſince that Empire is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger maintained by ſuch means, yet ought you to reſt ſatisfied with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Peace, and accept (as a high favour) a Dignity the King of <hi>Spaine's</hi> Son hath made ſuite for. If there were nothing elſe in it, but that it cauſeth you to quit your Mourning-robes, to reveſt your ſelf with the colour of Roſes, you can do no leſs than rejoyce at ſuch a change. Howſoever the neareſt objects to your eys, will not be ſo dolefull as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they were, ſince there will be nothing upon you, which ſhall not be reſplendent and glorious. I would willingly dilate this diſcourſe, but the ſpeedy departure of the Poſt will not ſuffer me; and beſides, I being well aſſured, that if you eſteem any thing in my Letters, it is not the multitude of words; I ought to be contented to end this, after my humble ſuite unto you, to love me always, ſince I am paſſionately</p>

                     <p>I Suppoſe you have underſtood of the <hi>Election</hi> of the Pope, ſome two days journies from <hi>Paris;</hi> and that you will make no great haſte to add your <hi>approbation</hi> to a thing already diſpatched: I had ſent a <hi>Poſt</hi> on purpoſe to advertiſe you thereof; but my Lord Embaſſadour thought it not fit, but hath encharged his own <hi>Meſſenger</hi> to advertiſe you of all things in your Voyage this way, and to give you account of all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. This makes me think that the ſubject of your voyage ceaſing, and the time of year being as yet ſomewhat troubleſome, for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking thereof, you will rather reſerve it for a fitter ſeaſon, when you may perform it with leſs diſorder, and more advantagiouſly for the Kings ſervice. My meaning is, that I would have you ſet forward about
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:120345:31"/>
the end of <hi>Autumne,</hi> that you may ſpend here with us, one of theſe warm and ſpringing Winters, laden with Roſes, wholy reſerved for our admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Italic.</hi> And my Lord, though herein the conſideration of my private intereſt may ſeem to make me ſpeak thus, rather than my <hi>affection</hi> to your ſervice; yet would I willingly tell you, that all kinde of contentments attend you here, and if your great <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> aſpire to glorious things for the keeping it in <hi>action,</hi> it ſhall infallibly finde them at <hi>Rome.</hi> In the interim, how ſhort a while ſoever you ſtay here, you ſhall have the contentment to ſee <hi>France</hi> change ſome five, or ſix times. At your return you will hardly finde any thing anſwerable to what you left there; they ſhall not be the ſame men you formerly ſaw, and all things will appear unto you, as the affairs of another Kingdom. But before the matter be grown to that head, it is fitting you reign here in <hi>Sovereigntie,</hi> and become the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Judge</hi> of three, or four <hi>Conclaves:</hi> And truly, it might ſo happen (my Lord) that I ſhould do you ſome acceptable ſervice in thoſe great occaſions, if I had my health; but to my great grief it is a happineſs, for which I envy my Grand-mother, and howſoever I have heretofore been little, or much eſtimable: I confeſs, that at this preſent, I am but the half of what I was. It is therefore in vain to expect works of any great value from me, or that you importune me to take pains for the <hi>Publick;</hi> for in <hi>Conſcience</hi> what high <hi>deſigns</hi> can a man have, between the affliction of <hi>diſeaſes,</hi> and the apprehenſion of <hi>Death?</hi> The one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doth never forſake me, and the other dayly <hi>affrights</hi> me; or how can you imagine I ſhould conceive eminent matters, who am ready to die at every <hi>instant.</hi> True it is, that the neceſſity to obey you, which I have always before mine eys, is an extraordinary ſtrong motive: but (not to diſſemble) the impoſſibility of my performance is yet more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible; and ſo long as I continue in the ſtate I now am, I cannot promiſe you ſo much as the Hiſtory of the Kingdom of <note n="*" place="margin">A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality in <hi>France.</hi>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:120345:32"/>
for this high favour: but beſides that your benefits are bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and that you are ſo gracious an obliger, that it doth even augment the value of your bounty, I ſhould ſeem over-preſumptuous to think any words of mine valuable to the leaſt of your actions. It ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuffice me to proteſt unto you, that the bounty, wherewith the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I received from you, is ſo ſtored, (being of force to infuſe Love and Fidelity in the hearts of very Barbarians,) ſhall work no leſs effect in the ſpirit of a perſon, who hath learned both by Nature and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy not to be ingratefull. Since I finde my intereſt within my duty, I muſt neceſſarily love you (if I hate not my ſelf) and be an honeſt man by the very Maxim of the wicked. Yet is not this laſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the cauſe chiefly obliging me to your ſervice: For though I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge divers defects in my ſelf, yet may I without vanity affirm, I was never beſotted with ſo baſe an attraction as that of gain. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reflect upon your favours in their naked purity, and the eſteem you make of me, is to me by ſo much a more ſtrong obligation, than all others, in that it regardeth my merit, and not my inſtant poverty, and proceedeth from your judgement, which is far more excellent, then your fortunes are eminent. Herein (my Lord,) it is manifeſt, that all your inclinations are magnificent: for you knowing me neither to be fit to make the Father of a Family, nor to ſolicite cauſes at the Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, nor well to ride poſt: you make it appear, you are of the right bloud of Kings, who are onely rich in ſuperfluous things. Truely, it were a hard matter to gueſs what in this World is the true uſe of Pearls and Diamonds; or why a Picture ſhould coſt more than a Palace; but onely pleaſure, which to ſatisfie the inventions of Art, are dayly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and nature to that end produceth whatſoever is rare, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a thing more noble than neceſſiy, ſhe being contented with ſmall matters, ever preferring profit before pleaſure. And I will here ſtop, leſt I ſpeak too much to my own advantage: And if I have already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred that crime, I beſeech you to believe it hath not been with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to praiſe my ſelf, but onely to extoll your liberality: Yet will I make bold to acquaint you, how I imploy your money, and yield you a more particular account of the affairs I diſpatch for you here at <hi>Rome:</hi> Firſt, in this hot Moneth I ſeek all poſſible remedies againſt the violence of the Sun. I have a Fan which wearieth the hands of four Grooms, and raiſeth a winde in my Chamber, which would cauſe ſhipwrack in the main Sea; I never die but I die Snow in the Wine of <hi>Naples,</hi> and make it melt under Mellons. I ſpend half my time under water, and the reſt on Land: I riſe twice a day, and when I ſtep out of my bed, it is onely to enter into a Grove of Orange-trees, where I ſlumber with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant purling of ſome twelve Fountains: but if occaſion be offered to go further once in a week, I croſs not the ſtreet but in a Carroach, paſſing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:120345:32"/>
ſtill in the ſhade between Heaven and Earth: I leave the ſmell of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt flowers unto the Vulgar, as having found the invention to eat and drink them. The Spring time never parts with me all the year, either in variety of diſtilled waters, or in Conſerves. I change perfumes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diverſity of ſeaſons; ſome I have ſweeter, others ſtronger: And though the Air be a thing Nature beſtows for nothing, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the pooreſt have plenty, yet that, I breath in my Chamber, is as coſtly unto me as my houſe-rent. Beſides all this, I in quality of my Lord your Agent, am almoſt dayly feaſted: and there whileſt others fill themſelves with ſubſtantial and moſt ponderous cates; I, who have no great appetite, make choice of ſuch Birds as are crammed with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and nouriſh my ſelf with the ſpirit of Fruits, and with a meat cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led jelly. My Lord, theſe are all the ſervices I yield you in this place, and all the functions of my reſidence near his holineſs; and I hold my ſelf particularly obliged now the ſecond time to thank you for this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: for by your means I injoy two things ſeldom ſuiting together; a Maſter and Liberty; and the great reſt you allow me, is not the leaſt preſent you pleaſe out of your Nobleneſs to affoord me.</p>

This is the advantage I draw from my bad legs, and the remedies ariſing in my bed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I indeavour to comfort my ſelf without the help of <hi>Phyſicks.</hi> You will (I fear) ſay, I might well have forborn to entertain you with theſe impertinencies; nor am I ignorant that perfect felicities, ſuch as yours, deſire not to be diſquieted, either by the complaints of the diſtreſſed, or by the conſideration of diſtaſtefull things: But it is likewiſe true, that the firſt loſs we indure in pain falls upon our judgement, and the body hath ſuch a proximity with the Soul, that the miſeries of the one, do eaſily ſlide into the other. But what reaſon ſoever I have to defend my evil humour, yet muſt it neceſſarily give way to your contentment; and of the two paſſions wherewith I am aſſaulted, obey the ſtronger. I will therefore be no longer ſad, but for others, and will hold it fit I make you laugh upon the ſubject of <hi>XXXXX.</hi> to whom you lately addreſſed your Letters. You may pleaſe to remember one of their names to be <hi>A.</hi> the other <hi>B;</hi> yet it is not ſufficient onely to know ſo much, but I muſt likewiſe inform you ſomewhat of their ſhape and ſtature. The firſt I ſpeak of, is ſo groſs, as I verily think he will inſtantly die of an <hi>Apople<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xie;</hi> and the other ſo little, as I would ſwear that ſince he came into the World he never grew, but at the hairs end: afore any indifferent Judges, an Ape would ſooner paſs for a man than this Pigmy; nor will I believe he was made after the image of God, left therein I ſhould wrong ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Nature. Beſides, it were an eaſier taſk to raiſe the dead, than to make this mans teeth white; he hath a Noſe at enmity with all others: and againſt which there is no poſſible defence but <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gloves. What can I ſay more, there is no part of his body that is not ſhamefull, or wherein Nature hath not been defective. Yet notwithſtanding one of the faireſt Princeſſes of <hi>Italie,</hi> is by a ſolemn contract condemned to lodge night by night with this Monſter. When you chance to ſee this man together with the other great bellied beaſt, who ſtuffs a whole Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roach, you will preſently ſuppoſe God never made them to be Princes; and that it is not onely as much as to abuſe the obedience of free per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:120345:33"/>
but even to wrong the meaneſt Grooms, to give them Maſters of this ſtamp. Now though the party you wot of, do in ſome ſort repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the latter perſon, yet is there ſtill ſome ſmall difference between his actions and the others. The great <hi>VVV.</hi> is newly parted from this Court, where he hath not received from his Holineſs his expected contentment. His deſign was to break the Marriage his Brother hath contracted, upon ſome ſlight appearance of Sorcery, wherewith he deemed to dazle the Worlds eye, and ground the nullity of an action, which was by ſo much the more free, in that the parties, who perform'd it, ſought not the conſent of any to approve it. In concluſion, after the loſs of much time, and many words, he is gone without obtaining any thing, ſave onely the <hi>Popes</hi> benediction; and as for me, I remain much ſatisfied to ſee Juſtice ſo exact at <hi>Rome,</hi> that they will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Devil himſelf wrongfully. I have heard how in ſome places half hour Marriages are made, the conditions whereof are neither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted into writing, nor any memorie thereof reſerved; but of theſe ſecret myſteries, there are no other witneſſes, ſave onely the Night and Silence: And though the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> approveth them not, yet doth ſhe ſhut her eys, fearing to ſee them. I am reſolved not to be long in the deſcription of <hi>K.K.K.</hi> whom you know much better than my ſelf: Yet thus much I will ſay, that ſince <hi>Neroes</hi> death, there never appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Italie</hi> a Comedian of more honourable extraction: And ſurely to make the Company at this preſent in <hi>France</hi> compleat, his perſonage were ſufficient: He makes Verſes, he hath read <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands Muſick, and in a word he hath all the excellent qualities unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in a Prince. I know here a <hi>German,</hi> called S. to whom he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth an annual penſion of a thouſand Crowns, aſſigned unto him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Abbey during life; this he hath done, not that he intendeth to uſe his ſervice in his counſel, or with purpoſe to imploy him in any important negotiation for the good of his affairs: his onely ambition is to have him make a book, whereby it might appear how thoſe of <hi>M M M.</hi> are lineally deſcended from <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> I ſhould be glad he would yet aim at ſome higher, or more eminent race, and that he would purchaſe a ſecond fable at the like rate he payed for the firſt. I would willingly give him his choice of the <hi>Medes, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, Greeks,</hi> or <hi>Troians,</hi> which of theſe he would have of his Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and without the relying upon the Authority of tradition, or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of Stories: I would draw his deſcent from <hi>Hector,</hi> or <hi>Achilles,</hi> which he beſt liked. There are certain Princes who are neceſſarily to be deceived, if you mean to do them acceptable ſervice, being far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſed to be entertained with a plauſible lie, than to be advertiſed of an important truth. I hold my ſelf right happy you are not of this humour: for whatſoever I ſay, I ſuppoſe it would be very hard for me to

be of a fools minde, though he were a Monarch. I intend not to ſteal your favours, but to purchaſe them legally: and having ever believed flattery to be as miſchievous a means to gain affection as charms, and ſorcery: I cannot ſpeak againſt my conſcience, and were not this true I tell you, I would not aſſure you, that I am</p>

                     <p>HOw great ſoever the ſubject of my ſorrows be, yet do I finde in your <hi>Letters</hi> ſufficient to make me happy in my hard fortune. The laſt I received hath ſo much obliged me, that, but for the diſpleaſing news coming unto me, which tempered my joy, my reaſon had not been of ſufficient force to moderate it. But at this time the death of my poor Brother being inceſſantly before mine eys, taketh from me the taſte of all good tidings: and the proſperity even of the Kings affairs ſeem diſpleaſing unto me, finding my ſelf to bear upon me the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Victorie. Yet ſince in this fatal agitation of <hi>Europe</hi> it is not I alone who bewail ſome loſs, and ſince your ſelf have not been able to preſerve all that was dear unto you; I ſhould ſeem very unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, if I preſumed to prefer my private intereſt before yours, or reflect upon my particular affliction, having one common with yours. It is long ſince I have not meaſured either the felicities, or fatalities of this World, but by your contentments, or diſcomforts; and that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold you as the whole workmanſhip God hath made. Wherefore my Lord, I willl lay aſide whatſoever concerns my ſelf, to enter into your reſentments, and to tell you, ſince you cannot make unworthy electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it muſt needs be that in death of your Friends you can ſuffer no ſmall loſſes. Notwithſtanding as you tranſcend ſublunary things, and in that all men draw examples out of the meaneſt actions of your life: I aſſure my ſelf they have acknowledged upon this occaſion, that there is not any accident to ſurmount, againſt which you have uſe of all your virtue. Afflictions are the gifts of God, though they be not of thoſe we deſire in our prayers; and ſuppoſing you ſhould not approve this propoſition, yet have you at all times ſo little regarded death, as I

But in truth all the World doth there finde both habitations and affairs: and for you my Lord, ſince in that Countrey our Kings both enter into their firſt infancy, and grow old, as being the ſeat of their Empire; no man can juſtly blame you for making over-long abode there, without accuſing you of over-much love to your Maſter, and for deſiring to be near his perſon. At <hi>Rome</hi> you ſhall tread upon ſtones, formerly the gods of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> and ſhall contemplate the ruins of thoſe rare workmanſhips, the antiquity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is yet amiable, and ſhall dayly walk among Hiſtories and Fables: But theſe are the paſtimes of weak ſpirits, which are pleaſed with trifles, and not the imployments of a Prince, who delighted in ſayling on rough Seas, and who is not come into the World to let it reſt idle: When you have ſeen the <hi>Tyber,</hi> on whoſe banks the <hi>Romans</hi> have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Apprentiſhips of their rare victories, and begun that high deſign, which they ended not, but at the extream limits of the Earth.

I make no doubt but after you have ſeen thoſe and divers other things, you will grow weary of the repoſe and tranquility of <hi>Rome:</hi> and will ſay they are two things more proper for the Night and Church-yards, than for the Court and the Worlds eye.

as you have obtained over ours; or that their policies will not be as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent in your <hi>Preſence,</hi> as the <hi>Charmes</hi> of <hi>Magicians</hi> are frivolous, being confronted with <hi>Divine</hi> matters. You have ſufficient of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to put off affairs when occaſion is offered: but you have a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage they come ſhort of, to carry matters by ſtrong hand, if neceſſity require. Therefore my Lord, to what part ſoever your opinion ſhall incline, you will carry that with you which gaineth victories, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the greater party to ſide with the founder; yea, if matters ſhould paſs without conteſtation, yet ſhould you at leaſt take notice, that you are intreated to that action, wherein God permits you to ſupply his place, and intruſteth to your care the moſt important matter of all his works. To ſpeak ſeriouſly, his providence is never in ſo high imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as when he is to chooſe the man who hath power to uſe well, or abuſe all the Riches of Heaven, and who is to exerciſe a power neareſt approaching to Divinity. Heretofore God made uſe of Thunder and Tempeſts, when he purpoſed to denounce any thing to men, declaring his Will by other than ordinary means. But ſince he hath cauſed Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to ceaſe, and ſuffereth the Thunder to work onely natural effects: It is onely by the voyce of Cardinals he cauſeth his deſires to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, and ordaineth concerning the Worlds Conduct. When you pleaſe (my good Lord) I ſhall have ſome notice of theſe inſpirations he hath ſent you, and of the election you have made: For to force me (ſo ſoon) to inform my ſelf thereof in the place where it was performed, this Kingdom had need be over hot for me, and that I were not ſo well acquainted as I am with the Sun at <hi>Rome.</hi> That which blacks the Moors, and burns <hi>Lybia,</hi> is not ſo dangerous at this Seaſon; and were you not ſtored with treaſures of Snow, and provided of Halls of Marble, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend you from the ſcorching Air, I ſhould as ſoon chuſe to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the fire, as to be forced to reſide where you are at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. But your Grace I know can not be affrighted with all theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of heat; you are none of thoſe who will finde fault with the Air, which all that ancient Republick breathed, or with the Sun, which hath holpen to make ſo many Conquerours, and given light to ſo many glorious Triumphs. Yet for my part, I who have none of theſe conſiderations, and who have wholy put my ſelf into the power of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, it is requiſite I avoid the very ſhadow of danger, and live with as great apprehenſion of fear in this World, as though I were in an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Countrey, or in a Forreſt of wilde beaſts. It is therefore out of pure neceſſity I attend your commands in this place, and a more ſeaſonable time, to teſtifie unto you, without running the hazard of my life, that I am with all my Soul</p>

                     <p>I Verily believed I could never have been ſo unfortunate, as to be forced to ſearch in the <hi>Gazettes</hi> for what you do, and to hear no other news from you, then what common brute beſtoweth in all parts of the World, and which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> may as well know as I. This puniſhment is by ſo much the more wounding, in that I have heretofore been enriched with thoſe benefits, whereof you now ſeem to bereave me; and in that the time was, when you pleaſed ſo far to diſcend from the rank whence you are derived, as to lay aſide all thoſe luſters which incompaſs you, to converſe freely with me: But (my Lord) ſince one word of your mouth hath often cured my decayed ſpirits, &amp; hath many times made me happy without the help of <hi>Fortune:</hi> I freely confeſs unto you, I cannot reſolve to change condition, as knowing the loſs of the leaſt of your favours cannot be little; Yet being ſo innocent that I can no way imagine my offence, and not acknowledging among men, other more aſſured verity then your word, I have a great reluctation to be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of a thing, upon the certainty whereof half the Court is ingaged for War, and the beſieged would make ſmall difficulty to ſurrender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. My Lord, you have pleaſed to promiſe you would love me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; therefore I beſeech you not to be offended, if I put you in minde, that as the ancient <hi>Gods</hi> of the Countrey where now you are, ſubmitted themſelves to <hi>Destinies,</hi> after they had once aſſigned them: So you, though above all other <hi>Laws,</hi> are yet ſubject to your word. I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it cannot be revoked ſo long as the order of ſublunary things change not, and the <hi>Decrees</hi> of Gods providence remain immoveable: and if you repent any one action in your whole life, you therein do more then your very <hi>Enemies,</hi> who never as yet called the leaſt of them in queſtion. For my part, I am far from thinking I have totally loſt your favours, left I ſhould wrong your <hi>judgement,</hi> which conferred them upon me, and blame the beſt eys in the World, for having heretofore been blinde. I will rather ſuppoſe, if you ſend me no news, it is becauſe you think I know what will be done ſome ten years hence, and that I am brimfull of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, and of the <hi>Italian</hi> affairs. Truely I know the preſent <hi>Pope,</hi> and I have ever believed, there is not any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wit more capable to carry ſo ponderous a felicity, or to let us again behold the primitive beauty of religion, and the golden age of Gods Church, I know how at <hi>Rome</hi> idleneſs is day and night in action and that the complements and ceremonies there, put you to more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then you ſhould finde in governing the whole World, if God had leſs
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:120345:38"/>
it to your conduct. Me thinks I yet ſee this great Tyrant with ſo many heads, (I mean the Signoury of <hi>Venice</hi>) together with all thoſe petty Soveraigns, who would hazard more men in hanging one ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then the <hi>King</hi> would venture: in two battails, or at the taking in of four Cities. But my Lord all this with the reſt doth but ſlightly touch my ſpirit, and as you are the ſole worldly cauſe, which affoordeth me either joy, or diſcomfort, ſo it is from you onely I expect good, or ill news: I have made your affection in ſuch ſort neceſſary for my lifes contentment, that without it I ſhould finde defects even in felicity it ſelf, and ſhould have an imperfect feeling of the moſt happy ſucceſſes could befall me. Reſtore therefore, if ſo you pleaſe, or continue this your ancient favour towards me, which I cannot poſſibly forbear. And ſince you are part of that body to which God hath given infalibility, and ſnce it is forbidden to call the certainty of your wiſdom into the leaſt queſtion: condemn not I beſeech you, what you have formerly made as though your <hi>Italian</hi> favours were ſome other things then your <hi>French</hi> ones.</p>

It is therefore fitting (if ſo he pleaſe) that he undertake this voyage, and put of State buſineſs, and the War to others, to live here in the midſt of <hi>Glorie</hi> and <hi>Triumphs.</hi> In the mean time, I may (ſo near as I can) inform my ſelf both of men and affairs, thereby to give you the better inſtructions at your coming. Now to the end to affoord you a taſte of what I know, obſerve what I ſay, for I will tell you ſtrange things. There is a certain great man here, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaineth ſix Aſtrologers in Penſion, to let him underſtand from time to time who ſhall be <hi>Pope:</hi> Another takes large fees on both ſides, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it the onely way to bring his Clients to compoſition: A third hath the moſt extravagant virtue you ever heard of, he leads a far more

pleſant life then the Duke of <hi>Oſſuna;</hi> and having read in holy Writ, how the wiſdom of the World is folly in Gods ſight, he imagines he ſhould offend his conſcience, if he were over wiſe.

I will not ſo far rely upon my own opinion, as to anſwer for the future: Yet when I conſider the actions of your life, which are ſo <hi>eminent,</hi> that we finde difficulty to believe them, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have been performed; and thoſe in ſuch, number, that <hi>ſtranger</hi> may well imagine you have lived from the very beginning of our <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy:</hi> I ſuppoſe I might boldly affirm, that, if there be yet any great matter remaining to be atchieved in the World, there is none but your ſelf muſt attempt it. You have poſſeſſed the favour of <hi>Kings,</hi> as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes which might fail you, and have not feared that their paſſions could out-laſt your <hi>innocencie.</hi> This virtue we ſo much admire, hath ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the ſame authority, our Fathers have adored. You have made no uſe of your power in State, which you have not ever ſince conſerved by the force of your <hi>courage.</hi> You have at all times preſerved the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>France</hi> amidſt the miſeries of times, and the uſurpation upon law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full power. Who is there can ſay this of himſelf? where are they that have ſtood firm between rebellion and ſervitude? where was there ever known an old age ſo neceſſary for the World, or ſo much good and bad Fortune equally glorious? My Lord, you know your ſelf too well, to ſuſpect me of flattery; and my humour is ſo aliene from any ſervile actions, as the Court hath not ſufficient hopes to cauſe me to do any thing againſt my conſcience. I then ſpeak as I do now; for the onely intereſt of virtue; and if that were not on your ſide, I would ſeek for it among our enemies to do it right: None will ſuſpect I have any preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at <hi>Madrill;</hi> or that I intend to make a Furtune in <hi>Holland;</hi> yet to hear me ſpeak of the Prince of <hi>Orenge,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>Spinola,</hi> one would ſay that I did at once expect Abbies from the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and were a penſioner to <hi>Spain,</hi> In ſum, I hold, my ſelf obliged to thoſe, who affoord me matter and means to reconcile the two rareſt things in this world, to wit; virtue and eloquence. And as their reputation hath need of my Pen, to make it immortal; ſo are their lives and actions right uſefull unto me, when I imploy my pains on excellent ſubjects. You have ever done me the honour to wiſh me well, and I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived innumerable favours from my Lord the Cardinal your Son; but howſoever, I humbly beſeech you to be confident that my affections are abſolutely pure, and that my particular intereſts have not any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance therewith. I am ſo happy as to have ſerved you in a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome

Herein my Lord, you make it appear that the meaneſt matters change their nature into more noble ſubjects, ſo ſoon as they become yours: and how of all men, you have conquered part, and acquired the reſt. I am verily perſwaded it were no leſs then to offend God, to deny obedience to a perſon ſo high in his favour as you are, and that his meaning is, this commanding ſpirit he hath conferred upon you, ſhould be maſter of all others. The honour therefore to you appertaining, being little inferiour to what we owe to ſacred things; and that beſides the ordinary providence which governeth the World, there being a particular one in Heaven, deſigned meerly for the conduct of your life, to make it admired in all after ages: it is necceſſary as well in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of this common conſideration, as for others particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning myſelf, I ſhould perpetually remain,</p>

                     <p>IN this general calm of the State, (wherein the affairs of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſeem to be aſleep, and the Worlds occurrents to be at a ſtand) all <hi>France</hi> expects your preſence at Court, to be the Authour of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired news, and to draw from the <hi>Kings</hi> breaſt the good intentions wherewith it is ſo richly ſtored. The reduction of <hi>Beam</hi> not ſtained with any drop of bloud: the truth wherein you have inſtructed all men, concerning the poſſibility of taking <hi>Rochel,</hi> and the order you have now lately left in <hi>Guiene,</hi> where you have reduced the Factions to ſuch a point, as their onely power conſiſteth in their perverſe humours; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth us in hope, that if God ſhould defer the ſafety of our State till an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other age, it could be no man (your ſelf excepted) for whom he hath reſerved ſo glorious enterpriſe. My Lord, it is certain he never ſhewed more miracles in thoſe places himſelf hath conſecrated to his glory and publick piety, and which he hath choſen on purpoſe there to manifeſt his power, then he hath done in your perſon. And when I conſider how often he hath protected you, contrary to all humane appearance; and the oppoſition you have encountred, in arriving to this height by ſo many rocks and precipices; I cannot but conſtantly believe you have over-paſſed the time of dying; and that for the Worlds general good, it is fitting you indure as long as the Sun, or Stars. To ſtop here, were to praiſe you imperfectly, and onely to make it appear you are able to affoard long ſervices. I will therefore ſay more: on which ſide ſoever I turn mine eys, be it that I convey them beyond the Seas, or make them paſs thoſe mountains which ſeparate us from our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, I finde not that perſon in any place, who can juſtly diſpute for glorie with you; or whoſe life is ſo illuſtrious as yours. I have ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered all whatſoever might give value, or reputation to the Courts of ſtranger Princes, and there truely I finde men who are well ſeen in Military affairs, and who have gained to themſelves no ſmall experience by means of an infinity of rules and maximes: But the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between thoſe men and your ſelf, is, that they cannot ſtir, nor make themſelves awfull without the <hi>Indies,</hi> Armies, and Cannons; whereas you are redoubtable all alone, and unarmed; yea, your very ſtilneſs terrifieth the greateſt enemies of <hi>France.</hi> This being abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true (as no man can doubt) it is high time the <hi>King</hi> do really make uſe of a man whom the neceſſity of his ſtate requireth of him, and that he no longer imploy thoſe improſperous perſons, under whoſe hands opportunities wax old, and his good fortune will fail him. It is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:120345:41"/>
that the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Alpes</hi> have formerly been <hi>French,</hi> and that our language is ſpoken in neighbouring Provinces, without ſuffering a ſtrange kinde of people ſtill to remain in the very bowels of our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who will not allow of our ancient Laws. There is now no longer means to cover this ſkar which diſhonoreth the face of State, or to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that Rebellion &amp; Loyalty live together. To ſpeak truth, what kinde correſpondency can be expected between the Miſtreſs of the houſe, and the Concubine? what a monſtrous production would that prove between a Monarchy and a popular government? and what kinde of Soveraign ſhould he be, who were dependent on his ſubjects, and his Councel ſubordinate to the Town-houſe? Truly, if Catholicks ſhould demand Cities of the <hi>King,</hi> proportionable to their number, as others do, he ſhould be forced hence-forward to remain all his life time at <hi>Fountain-bleau</hi> and S. <hi>Germins:</hi> nor would there remain unto him any more then the bare title of a <hi>King,</hi> and the common fields of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. But it ſhall not always be ſo if predictions prove true: And rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as well as nature requireth that things ſhould be reduced to their ancient form. It were no leſs then to injure him, who hath promiſed to <hi>France</hi> a longer continuance then to all her diſeaſes, to think that he having given remedies againſt the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> he will ſuffer it to die at this day by the hands of a ſmall pack of Rebels: Provided, that face which I rather call immortal, then ancient, do ſtill aſſure us of the great ſource of life you retain in your couragious heart, and that heaven pleaſe to preſerve for the Worlds benefit, the bleſſing it conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us at your Nativity; we require not a more certain preſage of the end of our evils; nor is there any ſo ſick, or far ſtrucken in years, who hopeth not to ſurvive theſe inteſtine troubles: But we are not to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that victory and peace are two oppoſite things, though they be different; for is the one which aſſureth the other, and ſetleth it in ſtate not to be any further either troubled, or threatned by any. When all is done, I finde it were much to oblige theſe malecontents, to give a ſure repoſe to their diſtruſtfull ſpirits, and at once to rid them of all their hopes and fears: when they ſhall no longer need to trouble themſelves with making aſſemblies, and that their lives ſhall be free from the fear of puniſhments. When I ſay, both they and we ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy common ſecurity, it is not to be doubted but their condition will be much bettered, it being a much fairer fortune to be caſt on ſhore by a ſtorm in a craiſed Veſſel, then to be ſtill in the power of windes and Sea-wracks. The word of <hi>Kings</hi> ought not to contradict the functions of Regality, nor can they oblige themſelves to leave their Subjects in miſerable eſtate, or to do contrary to what they ought. And in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſince the ruine of Rebellion is written in <hi>Heaven,</hi> in the ſame ſort as is the day of <hi>Judgement,</hi> and the Worlds diſſolution; were it
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:120345:42"/>
not as much as to reſiſt Gods will, and to oppugne his providence, ſhould we ſo ſoon grow weary of well-doing, or refuſe to finiſh a work, the event whereof is infallible? There is nothing ſo eaſie for a great <hi>Prince,</hi> as either to finde or conceive faults, nor doth any man doubt that diſſimulation is juſt, when it tends to the advantage and avail of the deceived. If a mad man were capable of remedies, were it not lawfull to cure him without aſking his conſent? were it fit a Father ſhould ſuffer his Son to be drowned for fear of pulling him out by the hair? Are we to ſuffer the State to periſh, for that we cannot preſerve it by ordinary ways? No, (my Lord) we ought not; there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration can cauſe that thing to change its nature, which of it ſelf it juſt; and the Laws of neceſſity do diſpence with us for thoſe of forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Now to return to my firſt diſcourſe, and to what particularly regardeth your Lordſhip; ſeeing your abſence from Court hath at all times threatned more miſeries unto us, then the apparition of Comets and other irregularities in Nature, and ſince to be miſerable, it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to be at odds with you. There is not any of your enemies can eſcape the <hi>Divine juſtice,</hi> nor is there any doubt, but you will gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally finde all thoſe ſpirits favourable unto you, whom you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly convinced; or that your propoſitions ſhall not be received as aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured Conqueſts. The beſt is, there are now no more any uſurpers near the <hi>King,</hi> who ſeek to ingroſs his favours to their own advantages, and bereave men of thoſe benefits which ought to be as common to them as the fire, or aire. His Majeſties heart is open to all his ſubjects, he receives truth at what hand ſoever it comes unto him. This being ſo (my Lord) may we not reſt confident you ſhall not loſe one word, and that your virtue whereof the World is uncapable, ſhall at length be found the onely means the <hi>King</hi> hath to redreſs and re-eſtabliſh his affairs. Neither time, travail, nor coſt, ought divert him from this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: It is a work will be nothing ſo coſtly as to raiſe a Favorite, and it being a thing all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> exacteth of him, as an Hereditary debt the <hi>King</hi> his Father hath left to be diſcharged. And truely, it is moſt certain that the face of States hath been changed, and whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces conquered, with leſs coſt then divers <hi>Pagan Princes</hi> have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in erecting of <hi>Idols,</hi> and cauſing them to be adored by their people. But to leave this <hi>Italian</hi> ſeverity you formerly reproved in me, and leſt you ſhould accuſe me for warring againſt the dead, I will for your ſake pardon their memorie; nor will I farther dilate my ſelf upon ſo odious a Subject. Yet is this but half of what I intended to ſpeak unto you at <hi>Coignac;</hi> if in that ſhort abode you made there, and the continual preſs hindring the freedom of my <hi>Speech</hi> unto you, it had been permitted me to have had a longer audience.

Whereunto <hi>Sir,</hi> I can give your Majeſty no other anſwer, but that having at all times gathered out of your commands, what my duty obliged me unto, and having never propoſed other end to my actions, then the good of your ſtate, I ſhould be carefull of ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that deſign in an occaſion wherein I might imagine your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice depended on my obedience. But at this preſent <hi>(Sir)</hi> the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of <hi>France</hi> groweth to be ſo general, your affairs ſo powerfully eſtabliſhed, and the honour of your <hi>Amity</hi> ſo precious among all your neighbouring Princes; that as there is nothing in this Kingdom which doth not bend under your Authority; ſo is there not any <hi>Prince</hi> abroad, who doth not reſpect your power, or who conſerveth not himſelf by your Juſtice. And as concerning the troubles of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> beſides, that time hath evaporated the firſt heat of ſpirits, and that they begin to retire from thoſe extremities wherein formerly they involved themſelves: the imagined danger is ſo far removed hence, as we cannot conceive the leaſt apprehenſion, even for thoſe who are not our next neighbours that way. It is certain <hi>(Sir)</hi> that on this ſide the <hi>Rhine</hi> all things ſeem to be at reſt under the ſhade of your State, and the ancient Allies of this Crown who are neareſt any danger, expect the end of War without fearing it ſhould come any further towards them, or that out of all this noiſe, there will ariſe any more then one War. Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations then do no way oblige me to ſtay in theſe parts, where things are in ſo good eſtate, as they may well nigh ſubſiſt of themſelves: beſides the reſidence my Son of <hi>Valette</hi> ſhall make there in my abſence,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:120345:43"/>
being ſufficient to give order to all occurrents concerning the good of your affairs. I aſſure my ſelf your Majeſty will be ſo impartial as to be pleaſed to reflect upon the neceſſity of my particular occaſions, and that ſuffering me to retire my ſelf to my own houſe, you will at leaſt permit me to enjoy a favour, uſually inflicted on others as a puniſhment. I doubt not <hi>(Sir)</hi> but you will condiſcend to the deſire I have to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this voyage, and I preſume you will be pleaſed to conſider, that I being ingaged in two hundred thouſand Crowns for your ſervice; after the ſight of your royal bounty in all ſorts of hands, it were ſmall reaſon (I receiving nothing) ſhould ſtill in this place ſtand as a meer cypher for the honour of <hi>France;</hi> or that I ruine my ſelf with a rich ſhew, onely to continue <hi>ſtrangers</hi> in the opinion they have of the magnificent great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Crown. Yet <hi>(Sir)</hi> having never believed I could ſuſtain any great detriment by the loſs of a thing I ſo ſlightly eſteem, as I do worldly ſubſtance, I intend not in this place to complain of my pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But (to ſpeak truth) ſince all my words and actions are by many miſ-interpreted; and that having affoarded my dutifull attendance to the ſervice of three great <hi>Kings,</hi> I yet finde much difficulty to defend my ſo long a loyalty againſt Calumny: I am with much ſorrow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſay, that if I ſtood firm in my duty, even when diſobedience was crowned with rewards; and have maintained your Authority, when by ſome it was abuſed, by others contemned: It is no ſmall injury to me, to imagine I will now begin to fail in my loyalty at this age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I am, or ſuffer my ſelf to be reproached by poſterity, whereto I ſtudy to annex the laſt actions of my life. But I ſee well <hi>(Sir)</hi> it is long ſince the hatred of diſhoneſt <hi>French-men</hi> hath been fatal unto me, and that it hath been born with me inſeparably. From the firſt hour I appeared in the World, there was never either peace or truce unvio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to my prejudice; and as though I were excepted out of all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, though War be ended, yet that made againſt me endureth. At this preſent <hi>(Sir)</hi> it ſufficeth not I perform my charge without omitting or forgetting any thing due to your ſervice; or that the innocencie of my actions be generally acknowledged; but I am driven to thoſe ſtreights, as to be forced to give account of my very thoughts, there being not any (my ſelf excepted) from whom ſatisfaction is required for the fault he hath not as yet committed. If we lived in a Countrey where virtue were avoided, as not concurrent with the times, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to the State, and where a great reputation were more dangerous then an inglorious one, I ſhould not need to make much ſearch for the cauſe of my misfortunes: but I well know the conduct you uſe, hath more honourable and honeſt grounds, and that your Majeſty hath no pretention to reign with more aſſurance then the <hi>King</hi> your Father did before you. It is from him <hi>(Sir)</hi> you may learn how you are to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:120345:43"/>
wounded innocencie from wicked impudencie: and to know it is ordinary to draw honeſt men into ſuſpicion, thereby to make them unſerviceable. In following his example, you ſhall finde out the truth, though never ſo cloſely hidden, or what ſhadow ſoever they caſt over the ſame to diſguiſe it. And truely <hi>(Sir)</hi> ſince this great Prince in beſtowing your Origin upon you, hath together there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with conferred his moſt Royal inclinations, I will never believe, that to follow a ſtranger paſſion, you will loſe thoſe perfections ſo proper, and natural unto you; or that for me alone your Majeſty hath any other ſpirit then for the reſt of men. Truely, if when you were not yet at your own liberty, ſuch hath been the natural goodneſs of your gracious diſpoſition, as you have at all times reſiſted violent counſels, nor have ever permitted your Authority ſhould be imployed to the ruine of your ſubjects: there is ſmall appearance, that having now by publick and ſolemne act obliged your ſelf to reign alone, and your bounty finding not any obſtacle to hinder the ſame, you would diſturb the old age of one of your beſt ſervants, or deny to his gray hairs that reſt nature requires at your hands, I ought to hope (at leaſt) for this recompence for my long and faithfull ſervices, ſince your Majeſtie may beſtow it without incommodateing your affairs, and beſides, I having never expected other reward of worthy actions, then the onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to have performed them, I ſhall hold my ſelf ſufficiently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, to receive from my conſcience the teſtimonies, which whileſt I live it will affoard me, that I have been, really am, and ever will to the end remain,</p>

Nevertheleſs, <hi>(Sir)</hi> your Majeſties will, doth ſo regulate mine, that I had not removed, had not the cauſe of my ſtay there ceaſed, and the difficulties of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> War been utterly removed. But have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had perfect intelligence by the relations the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> hath received from thoſe parts, that the affairs there begin to be well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the overture thereof beginning with the ſuſpenſion of War on both ſides; I could not imagine the good of your ſervice did any way oblige me to remain longer in a place out of all danger in time of peace, and which will make good uſe of the Empires weakneſs if the War continue: conſidering likewiſe that if there be any part of your State leſs ſound then the reſt, and where your Authority had need with more then ordinary care to be conſerved, it is queſtionleſs in the Province whither I am going, which bordering upon ſuch neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as all honeſt men may juſtly ſuſpect; and being a people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of divers parts, have at all times been either troubled, or threatned with changes: yea, at this preſent <hi>(Sir)</hi> the moſt common opinion is, that the aſſembly now holden at <hi>Rochel,</hi> is no way plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto you, and that if you have been drawn to give any aſſcent thereto, it hath rather been a connivency to the neceſſity of time, then conformable to your will. Whereupon <hi>(Sir)</hi> if your Majeſty pleaſe to reflect upon the miſeries of your State, where out at leaſt you have drawn this advantage, that even in the very ſpring of your age, you have attained great experience: You ſhall plainly ſee that all the miſeries which befell your Majeſty in your minority, have been begun upon the like occaſions. I therefore uſing my beſt indeavours, if the intentions of thoſe of <hi>Rochel</hi> be good; to hinder that the events be not evil; therein I hope I ſhall no way diſobey you Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties commands; but do rather explain them according to the true ſenſe, allowing them the beſt interpretation, ſince it is moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for your ſervice. Truely <hi>(Sir)</hi> no man is ignorant, that as the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of your Authority is the principle Law of your State: ſo likewiſe that the moſt expreſs and important part of your commands, is the good of your affairs. This being undoubtedly true, what appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is there, it being in my power to preſerve the affections of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Province in due obedience to your Majeſty, and to pacifie by my preſence thoſe affections eaſily drawn to revolt, if none did confirm them in their loyalty: I ſhould (for the interrupting ſo neceſſary a voyage,) propound to my ſelf ſo frivolous conſiderations, and thoſe ſo far fetcht as the Wars of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> I live not in an age <hi>(Sir)</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I am permitted to feed my ſelf with vanity; but I do not withall ſuppoſe your Majeſty doth ſo ſlightly eſteem of my ſervice, as not to make any farther uſe of me, ſave onely to ſee the packets from <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> ſafely conveyed; nor do I finde my ſelf ſo un-uſefull, as to be

forced inſtead of better imployments; onely to let you know what news is ſtirring, and to give you an account of ordinarie rumours.

Howſoever it happen, <hi>(Sir)</hi> or how badly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I be intreated, I am determined to continue reſolute in well-doing.

Truely, I may juſtly ſay, that the Conduct I have uſed, hath been ſuch: the <hi>Queen</hi> your Mother, having done me the honour to make uſe of my ſervice in a buſineſs, ſhe deemed much to import the good of your State; as not making uſe of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which might ariſe by cauſing miſchief to continue, or by giving way to ſuch deſigns, the event whereof would have ſufficiently commended the reſolution, had they not been diſadvantagious unto you: I have contented my ſelf to teſtifie to all <hi>France,</hi> that I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to your Authority even in the hands of mine enemies: whereby <hi>(Sir)</hi> I truſt I have cauſed my actions to appear ſo pure and unſpotted before your Majeſtie, that you remain fully ſatisfied; nor will you I hope judge I have erred, in following a cauſe I might probably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe could not be well ſeparated from yours. Now therefore ſince it hath pleaſed your Majeſtie to ſupply what ſeemed deficient in the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of your Reign, and to ſettle peace in your State: All your true

To be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the concluſion will not correſpond to theſe fair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings: were either to make doubt of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or to diſtruſt his grace; but it hath pleaſed his <hi>Divine Majesty</hi> at all times to take ſo particular care for the conſervation of your Familie, that he will as ſoon permit his Altars and images to be irreverently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, as perſons, who are ſo high in his favour as all of you are.

All <hi>France</hi> attends his reſolution to be rightly informed in the truth of the <hi>Kings</hi> affairs, and all men know he is of ſuch conſideration in this State, as his leaſt diſcontentments are to be reckoned among publick miſeries. I will perſwade my ſelf they will not proceed to any extreamity, and that there is not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency enough in our Enemies to tranſport them to ſo dangerous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:120345:46"/>
If the worſt come, yet muſt this voyage neceſſarily produce the one of two things, equally neceſſary in a troubleſome time, War, or Liberty. I am not ſo clear ſighted in future events, as to anſwer for what ſhall happen; yet ſince the order of ſeaſons are framed to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate our paſſage, and that all things have changed more ſuccesfully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us then we preſumed to deſire; there is ſmall appearance that <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> will declare it ſelf in favour of the leſs ſupportable cauſe. But that which doth the rather fortifie my confidence, is the vigorous eſtate wherein I finde my Lord your Father, he hath no ſhew of old age, ſave onely experience and Authority. The late <hi>Ligue,</hi> the Rebels, the Sword, nor poyſon have not been of power to kill him, nor was there ever man ſo awfull in his adverſe fortune. As for you (my Lord) who are the object of his hopes and fears; and who are to perform one of the principal parts in his deſigned action:<note place="margin">The City of <hi>Mets.</hi>
                        </note> remember you have the command of a place which hath been the diſhonour of <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, and which affoardeth <hi>France</hi> a revenge for all the affronts he offered thereto. He who defended it againſt him had no more then two arms as you have, and one ſingle life, nor was he made of any other matter then other men are. It is true, he fought by the <hi>Kings</hi> ſuccours, but it ſufficeth you fight for his ſervice, and that all men know you are reſolved not to ſurvive your fortunes. Were you born to perform ordinarie actions, I ſhould hold it fit to ſpeak unto you in another ſtrain; but ſince you purpoſe not to exerciſe any idle dignity in this World, nor are at this preſent in caſe to make uſe of the hands of a great Army, or expect reputation in your bed; ſpeak as high as you pleaſe, provided you act accordingly; and that out of your particular forces (ſince thoſe of the State fail you) you make good unto the <hi>King,</hi> the laſt conqueſt of his Anceſtors. One onely worthy man hath heretofore been the whole Republick of <hi>Rome,</hi> and hath reſiſted the fury of a victorious Army. So though there were no more true <hi>French-men,</hi> but my Lord your Father, your ſelf, and my Lords your brothers, I could no way diſpair of publick affairs, nor of the furtune of this Kingdom. My Lord, I am ſo weary, that I am forced to defer the continuation of this diſcourſe till another time, and to reſt a while to make a more ample relation.

                     <p>SInce it appears you have a will to loſe every hour what you can in truth ſpend but once, and that you ſo ſlightly eſteem your life, as though it were another mans; me thinks the War hath dealt very kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with you, in being contented to leave you half a face, and that you may well account what is left, as gotten goods. The Duke <hi>de Mayne,</hi> and the reſt were not quit at ſo eaſie a rate: and it hath pleaſed God to ſhew examples in this kinde, to make it appear that he approveth not vanity; nor that he heedeth the adviſe of men for the defence of his own and his Churches cauſe. Truely, if theſe men had practiſed with the enemy, they could not have been more confident; nor have gone more naked to War, had they fought againſt women: And in truth I am ſo far from praiſing their deſperate courſes, as I do not ſo much as pardon them their deaths; and if my opinion had paſſed, I ſhould have thought it fit to have accuſed them as culpable of their own deaths, and as ſuch who had committed the greateſt Parricides. It becomes me ill in this place to preſcribe rules to my Maſter; for ſhould I attempt to teach your courage how far it ſhould extend it ſelf, I might ſeem to do no leſs then preſcribe Laws to what is illimitable. Yet be pleaſed (I pray you) to be informed, that valour is ſo tender and delicate a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that if it be not ſometimes well ſhielded and concerved by ſome others, it becometh more hurtfull to him who hath it, then healthfull for the State, often endamaged by it, or to the Prince who maketh uſe thereof. And ſurely without the aſſiſtance of reaſon, which ought to be its Governneſs, and Prudence as a guide unto it: there is not any paſſion more blinde, nor which doth leſs differ from the fury of beaſts, and the bruitiſh ferocity of Barbarians: The latter of theſe think it cowardiſe to quit the place, though the breach of a River rowl upon them; or not to ſtand firm though they ſee a houſe falling on their heads. But theſe wretches, and we, have not the ſame pretentions; for as they propound to themſelves, onely to kill, and to die, ſo ſhould we onely aim at victory, and neglect the reſt; otherwiſe to what end is the knowledge of virtue unto us, and of the limits which boundeth it, or to be born under a more happy Climate, then that of <hi>Polonia</hi> and <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovia:</hi> if we draw no advantage either from the excellency of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, or extractions; I do not at all wonder, why there are men who prefer death before indigence, and who not finding any content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their own Countries, are well pleaſed to paſs beyond the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:120345:47"/>
Ice of their natural air, as willing to forgo the infelicity of their fortunes. But a man of worth, who at all hours injoyeth both perfect and pure contents, and who hath a great ſhare of this ages virtue to loſe, is a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour to the Publick, and a Tyrant to himſelf, if he forſake all this for a meer fancy, and deprive the World thereof, onely for a flaſh of Fame and vain Glory. You know this better then I can tell it you, and if you ſuppoſe the Phyloſophy you have heretofore ſo highly eſteemed, be yet wiſe enough to inſtruct you, ſhe will tell you that Life is the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of all other good that can here befall us; ſince by means thereof one may recover Kingdoms, though utterly loſt, and remain Victor, after having been defeated in four battails. There is no queſtion but a dead Lion is leſs worth than a living Dog, or that the moſt part of thoſe Princes of whom there hath been ſo much ſpeech, &amp; thoſe valiant Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains with whoſe Heroick acts ſo many Hiſtories are ſtored, would not willingly change their Laurels for our lives. Rejoyce therefore (good Sir) together with Nature: in that you are as yet in the number of men; and comfort your ſelf with <hi>Hanibal,</hi> and the Father of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, for the loſs you have received: whatſoever you can ſay, you have yet ſight enough to cauſe you to turn love-ſick, and to contemplate the beauties of Heaven and Earth. But ſuppoſe you were wholy blinde, yet is it true, that the Night hath its pleaſures as well as the Day; yea, and ſuch as you beſt love.</p>

                     <p>MY dear <hi>Hidaſp,</hi> thou canſt not imagine the content I take in thy Letter, and in the good news it brings me, it is the onely way to cauſe me to contradict my ſelf, when I account my eſtate miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, ſince I hear thou art in health, and loveſt me.

Thou art (then) as neceſſary for my living as life it ſelf; ſo as if thou deſireſt my eſtate, thou needeſt not for that any other means, than to deprive me of thy good opinion: But truely I never had the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of ſuch a loſs, and I aſſure my ſelf if I were dead, thou ſhouldeſt be double as rich as thou deſireſt to be.

But herein you are to make election of place, and perſons, and not wilfully to deprived the ſelf of the moſt pleaſing fruit of mans life, there being not any, in whoſe breaſt we may ſecurely depoſite either our griefs, or joys.

confeſs that moſt things are involved in uncertainties, and that humane ſciences have very ſlender and uncertain foundations; yet are there ſome truths ſo perſpicuous, and ſo abſolutely received into the Worlds approbation, as it were no leſs then to lack common ſenſe, to call them into queſtion; for he who ſhould ſay, my Lord the Conſtable <hi>d' Eſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiers</hi> were not valiant, or my Lord the Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> were not a man of able parts: doubtleſs all men would wonder at him, as at one who ſought to introduce ſome new Sect, or indeavour to overthrow the fundamental <hi>Laws</hi> of the Kingdom. Nay, I tell you yet more; you are pyouſly to believe divers ſots to be ſufficient men, ſince the World will have it ſo; and that <hi>Kings</hi> are not the onely men who deſire com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſencie; ſince if we mean to live among others, we muſt ſometimes neceſſarily flatter, and frame our ſelves to their opinions. Let us then follow the judgement of the wiſe, and the cuſtomes of the vulgar; let us keep our thoughts to our ſelves, and allow them our actions and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. As I have adviſed thee not to be over ſilent, ſo would I not have thee over talkative, nor to weary any one with thy diſcourſe of <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban,</hi> or the exploits thou haſt there ſeen performed. I aſſure thee to avoid the company of theſe boaſting companions; I would take poſt, go to Sea, or fly to the Worlds end. They ſeem to me to have gotten a patent for prateing, and that it were no leſs then to take their purſe, if one ſhould offer to ſpeak a word in their preſence: But above all, it is very death to me, when theſe fellows come freſh out of <hi>Holland,</hi> or when they begin to ſtudy the <hi>Mathematicks.</hi> From <hi>Millan</hi> to <hi>Sienna</hi> I was haunted with one of theſe Chapmen; whoſe company I ſhall ſo long as I have life, reckon among my greateſt misfortunes. He would needs reform all the fortifications of thoſe ſtrong places we paſſed by; he trode on no earth at which he carped not, nor travailed over any Mountain, on which he had not ſome deſign; he ſet upon all the Citties in the Dukedom of <hi>Florence;</hi> he deſired onely a certain ſhort prefixed time, to take in all the States of <hi>Medena, Parma,</hi> and <hi>Urbin:</hi> yea, I had much ado to draw him from caſting his deſigns upon the lands of the Church, and S. <hi>Peters</hi> Patrimony. Theſe be diſeaſes the roots whereof are not to be cut up, without taking away the tongue withall: Nay, I fear when all this is done, there will be yet need to paſs further into the cure, and to uſe means to bereave them of voyce, for the general good of ſuch as can hear. There is yet another ſort of importunate people, whoſe number doth ſo multiply in <hi>France,</hi> it is almoſt arrived to an infinity: Theſe have not one half hours intertainment for thee, without telling thee the <hi>King</hi> is raiſing puiſſant forces; how ſuch a one is out of credit with his faction; another is a great ſearcher into, and medler in State-matters, and how a third diveth into all the intricacies of Court-buſineſſes.

                        </gap>e are as well ſerious follies, as ſlight ones, I would admoniſh thee in this place: Now though a men at twenty can have no great experience of the World, yet have you a ſufficient clear judgement to keep your ſelf from being deluded, by the appearance of good, or by the outward luſter of evil. I had need of more time then the bearer allows me, and of more words then a Letter is capeable of, ſufficiently to inſtruct thee what thou oughteſt to do, and what to avoid; or to learn thee a Science wherein my ſelf do ſtudy in teaching thee. I will therefore onely ſay, ſince I am haſtned to make an end, that before all other things thou art to offer thy whole will to God, if thou beeſt not able to give the reſt; and to have (at leaſt) good deſigns, if it be not as yet in thy power to do any good deeds. I well know it is no ſlender taſk, to undertake to guard our ſelves from evil, where inticements are extraordinary, and the danger extream, and where (thou wilt tell me) that if God will hinder thee from loving beauty, he had need make thee blinde. I having no pleaſing anſwer to make thee hereto my dear <hi>Hydaſpe,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thee to thy Confeſſor: intreating thee to conſider, how if the <hi>King</hi> in the flower of his age wherein we ſee him, and in the midſt of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of objects offering themſelves to give him content, is yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſo firm in the reſolution to virtue, that he as eaſily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth all voluptuous irregularities, as he doth his moſt violent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and is not any way acquainted with forbidden pleaſures, nor doth glut himſelf even with lawfull ones: If as I ſay, this truth be generally avowed, I beſeech thee tell me why continency may not be placed among things poſſible? But I much fear, there is no means to gain this for granted at thy hands; ſince thou believeſt as others do, that to be chaſte, were no leſs then to uſurp upon the poſſeſſion of married wives. Yet at the leaſt <hi>Hydaſpe,</hi> if this body of thine, being of ſufficient ability to ſend Collonies into each corner of the World, and to people the moſt deſart places, will needs be imployed; I intreat thee to ſtay there, without being tranſported with the debauches of the mouth, which have no other limits then the loſs of reaſon, and ruine of health.

ſhould be in utter deſpair were it told me, that my brother drinks as much as though he were in a continual <hi>Feaver,</hi> and were as great a purveyer for his panch, as if he were to enter into a beſieged Citty. I confeſs thy inclination doth of it ſelf ſufficiently divert thee from theſe <hi>Germain</hi> virtues, and that thou art not much leſs ſober than my felf, who have paſſed over three years without ſuppers, and who would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly feed onely upon Fennill and pick-tooths, if I thought I could thereby recover health. Yet truely this doth not hinder me from have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome apprehenſion, when I conſider how the examples of great ones doth often give Authority to vice: and that to keep our ſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in the midſt of corruption, is not an effect of the ordinary force of men: Conſider then once again <hi>(Hydaſp)</hi> that we are powerfully to reſiſt temptations.

the moſt vigilant Prince living, nor ſhould I need either Guards, or Sentinels about my perſon. Surely there is not any (my ſelf excepted) for whom night was not made, ſince when the windes are calm, and all nature quiet, I alone watch with the Stars. But I much fear leſt God will not be ſatisfied herewith, ſince I fore-ſee ſo many miſeries ready to rowl upon me, as I have no ſmall apprehenſion to become more wretched to morrow, than I am at this preſent. The onely counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of <hi>Hydaſp</hi> would refreſh me, and cauſe my pain to be in ſome ſort pleaſing. But ſince there are now at leaſt a dozen great Cities, and a hundred leagues of Snow between us, I have much ado to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear dying, and to ſupport my ſelf upon my weakeſt part. Yet my meaning is not to have thee return hither; for (were it poſſible for me) I had much rather come to thee, and continually to gaze on that face whereof I have drawn ſo many fair poutraicts. It is true, there are few men living, whoſe love we ſhould prefer before liberty. But aſſure thy ſelf thy Maſter is of thoſe; be not therefore more proud then <hi>Henry</hi> the third, who firſt obeyed him. For my part, though I be natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refractory, yet have I ever had a ſpecial inclination to his ſervice; yea, when all things went croſs with him, and that his beſt friends for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook him, I took pleaſure in periſhing, on purpoſe to affoard him ſome conſolation in his calamities. Many deſire a dependency on him out of their particular ends, but me thinks we ſhould have more noble deſigns, ſince his onely virtue deſerveth to be followed, and to cauſe a preſs whereſoever it paſſeth. In truth, the ſervice we yield to ſo great a perſon, ought to hold the rank of the chief recompences we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; yet after this, there followeth another ſeldom failing any of good parts; yea, or thoſe who have but patience. If thou heeſt of the one, or other ſort of ſuch men, remember this maxime; and do not as thoſe honeſt perſons, who think they do good ſervice to the State, when they betray their Maſters. Beaſts themſelves are capeable of acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that <hi>Italian</hi> had ſome ſmall ſhew of reaſon, who called thoſe Devils, who cured Agues, good Angels. Yet truely it is no leſs than to be over mannerly to go ſo far, nor would I thank Gods enemies for thoſe gracious favours I indeed receive from him onely. But as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt of worldly affairs, there is no queſtion, but we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the neareſt occaſions Fortune affoardeth us; and thoſe who ſeek after more remote means, ſhall in concluſion finde from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to another, that it is to <hi>Hugh Capete</hi> to whom they are obliged.

Though the <hi>Queens</hi> Court be ſo chaſte, as it were eaſier to drink drunk of a fountain, then to take any diſhoneſt pleaſures there, and that to gain admittance, it is requiſite to be firſt purified at the Porters lodge; yet are you allowed even there to have pleaſing tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, and going elſewhere, to ſeek out more ſolide contentments. But as for me in the caſe I am, I make no difference at all between lovely creatures, and well limmed pictures: and the miſery I endure, having bereaved me of action, my wretched virtue is as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, as the ſobriety of the poor is neceſſary. In all this I add not one word to the bare truth; and if the Count of <hi>Pountgibaut</hi> had his pardon to let you know how it is with me, he would tell you that I am more withered then the laſt years Roſes, and how all the Ingeniers in an Army, were no more then ſufficient to remove me. But my diſcourſe will be more pleaſing, if I ſpeak of that head which deſerveth to fill a Diadem, then in continuing this wretched complaint. When at the firſt I ſaw concurrent in him ſo much valour, and ſo great beauty, I neither took him for man nor woman; but after having recollected my ſelf, I ſuppoſed him to be the <hi>Amazonian</hi> Queen: and doubtleſs in the

Worlds infancy, it was to ſuch faces onely, whereto all people yielded willing obedience, none quitting their ſervice, every mans duty being conformable to his inclination; ſo as the onely means then to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, was to be blinde. When this young Lord came to <hi>Rome</hi> at his return from te battail of <hi>Prague,</hi> I can well witneſs the jealouſie he a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This (to ſpeak truth) is a thing God ſuffereth as rarely to be ſeen as deluges, and other great effects of his power, or juſtice, in a long proceſs of time the meereſt Cowards may become Maſters; were it by no other means, but that by ſeeing all men die before them, they may inherit the whole World. Divers likewiſe have performed great exploits, who have begun their actions either with groſs errours, of mean adventures. But as there are very few Rivers navigable even from their firſt fountains, nor Countries where the Sun ſendeth forth his full heat from the very day-ſpring: ſo are ſuch men (doubtleſs) very rare and ſingular, who have not any need either of growth, or years; nor are ſubject either to the order of times, or rules of nature. But I have no purpoſe to fold up a book in a Letter: for though my grief do ſometimes permit me to ſpend ſome ſmall time upon pleaſing ſubjects, yet will it not allow me to make thereon any long ſtay. I muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leave off, during my ſhort good day, leſt I fall ſick again in your preſence, and once more clogg you with my complaints, inſtead of thanking you for your kinde remembrance, and aſſuring you of the great deſire I have to remain ſo long as I live,</p>

                     <p>THough I receive no news from you, and howbeit thoſe from <hi>Paris</hi> are generally naught: yet am I ſo confident of your excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, as I cannot imagine it can be endamaged by that contagious

aire; Surely if it be not in ſuch ſort infected, that birds fall down dead, and that the Springs be not corrupted, you have ſmall cauſe to fear; and I have heretofore ſeen you of ſo perfect a compoſition, and ſo ſtrong a ſubſtance, that an ordinary infection (I ſuppoſe) is unable to ſeize upon you: And rather than I will have any apprehenſion of your being carried away with the current of thoſe who die of this great mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality; I ſhall ſooner believe that God reſerveth you to make the worlds Epitaph, and thoſe laſt Songs appointed for the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane joys. Yet ere it comes to this point, remember your promiſe, I pray you, and ſend me ſomething to rid me of the <hi>Megreme</hi> I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in reading the ſotteries of theſe times. I cannot counterfeit the matter, but muſt confeſs I taſte Verſes as I do Mellons; ſo as if theſe two ſorts of Fruits have not a reliſh near approaching to perfection, I know not how to commend them though on the <hi>Kings</hi> Table, or in <hi>Homers</hi> works. Whatſoever you do, yet at the leaſt permit nothing to your ſpirit which may wound your reputation; and above all, let me intreat you not to be the man who may juſtly be taxed of having vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the chaſtity of our language, or for inſtructing the <hi>French</hi> in forreign vices, utterly unknown to their Predeceſſours. Poetry, which God hath ſometimes made choice of, for the uttering of Oracles, and to unfold his ſecrets to mankinde, ought at the leaſt to be imployed in honeſt uſes: Nor is it a leſs offence to make uſe thereof in vicious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, than to violate a Virgin. This I ſpeak upon the ſubject of our friend, whoſe end I fear will hardly be natural, if he die not the ſooner of his fourth Pox. This is the ſecond time he hath iſſued out of <hi>Paris</hi> by a breach, having eſcaped as furious a flame as that of <hi>Troy.</hi> For my part, I cannot conceive what ſhould be his deſign. For to war againſt Heaven; beſides, that he ſhall be but ſlackly accompanied in ſuch an expedition, nor hath a hundred hands as it is ſaid of Gyants; he ought to underſtand, it was an action they could never atchieve: and how in <hi>Cicilia</hi> there are Mountains yet ſmoaking with their Maſſacre. We come not into this World to preſcribe Laws, but to ſubmit our ſelves to thoſe we finde, and to content our ſelves with the wiſdom of our fore-fathers, as with their Land and Sun. And truely, ſince in matters indifferent, novelties are ever reprehenſible, and that our <hi>Kings</hi> quit not their <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> to quarter <hi>Tulipans</hi> in their arms: by how much greater right are we obliged to conſerve the ancient, and fundamental points of religion, which are by ſo much the more pure, in that by their antiquity they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach nearer to the Origine of things, and for that between them, and the beginning of all good, there is the leſs time ſubject to corruption. To ſpeak plainly, there is ſmall appearance that truth hath from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World attended this man, on purpoſe to diſcover it ſelf unto him in a Brothell, or Tavern; and to be ſent forth of a mouth
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:120345:52"/>
which comes ſhort in ſobriety to that of a <hi>Suiſſe.</hi> I intend not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with the Courts of Parliament, nor to prevent their decrees by mine opinion: And to think to make this man more culpable then he is, were as much as to caſt Ink on an <hi>Ethiopians</hi> face; I owe ſo much to the memory of our fore-paſt acquaintance, as I rather pitty him as a diſeaſed perſon, then purſue him as an enemy. I confeſs he hath parts in him not abſolutely ill, nor do I deny I have much pleaſed my ſelf with his freedom of ſpeech, ſo long as he propoſed onely men for his object, and ſpared to ſpeak of holy things. But when I heard ſay, he exceeded the bounds of inferiour matters, and banded himſelf even againſt what is tranſcendent to Heaven, I inſtantly quitted all acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him, and thought the onely pleaſure I could do him, was to pray to God to reſtore him to his right ſences, and to take pitty on him as he did of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who crucified our Saviour. Hereafter I will be better adviſed then to weary you with ſo long a diſcourſe, or to tire my ſelf in troubling you: But truely I thought I could do no leſs after three years ſilence, eſteeming this not to be over much for a man who is ſo ſlow a pay-maſter, for ſo many Letters he oweth you. Yet cannot I conclude, before I inform you of ſome particulars touching the place where I am at this preſent, and of my imployments here. Firſt there is no day paſſeth wherein I ſee not the riſing and ſetting of the Sun, and how during that time, I withdraw my ſelf from all other diſtractions, to enjoy the purity of that fair light. Behold here in this preſent ſtate wherein I am, all the Courtſhip I uſe, and the onely ſubjection I oblige my ſelf unto. When I deſire to take the air at other hours of the day, I muſt indeed confeſs my eys have no objects ſo vaſt as the Sea, or <hi>Appenines,</hi> not do I behold <hi>Rome</hi> under my feet as formerly I have done: Yet do I on all ſides diſcover ſo pleaſing a proſpect, as thouge it fill not the capacity of my ſpirit ſo much as did the other, yet doth it far more content me. Painters come forty days journeys hence, to ſtudy in my Chamber, and if nature cauſe her greatneſs to appear, even from the bottom of the deepeſt <hi>Abyſses,</hi> and darkeſt downfalls, ſhe hath no leſs placed her rareſt perfections under my windows. Moreover, I am plunged in abundance up to the eys, but my riches are tacked to the twigs and branches of Trees; for as Summer hath made me plentifull, ſo will Winter reduce me to my former poverty. In the mean time, I make Feaſts of <hi>Figgs</hi> &amp; <hi>Mellons,</hi> yea, out of the very <hi>Muſcadine</hi> Grapes I eat, there iſſueth liquor enough to make half a Kingdom drunk; and the thing whereat happily you will wonder, is, that I put all this into a ſick mans ſtomack, to whom well-nigh all good things are forbidden: yet have I found a means to reconcile my ſurfets with my Phyſical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and in one and the ſame day I both enjoy pleaſure, and endure pain; for I nouriſh my Feaver with excellent fruits, and purge it with

The firſt men the World produced, attained to extream age with ſuch pure cates as mine are; for as of all bloudy meats they onely uſed <hi>Cherries</hi> and <hi>Mulberries;</hi> ſo was the ſimplicity of their lives accompanied with a perfect repoſedneſs; Nature as yet being void of all Monſters: There was as then no mention either of <hi>Geryon,</hi> or <hi>Minotaure,</hi> nor of φφφφ.

                     <p>YOur <hi>Letter</hi> of the fifteenth of the laſt Moneth, came to my hands as I was ready to ſeal theſe Preſents. You might have juſt cauſe to tax me, ſhould I let them go unanſwered, or if this dead man appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your preſence, did not give you thanks for the many excellent words you have uſed in the adorning his Funeral Oration. I ſhould be but too proud if others were of your opinion, or were infected with the like errour you are; but I much fear you will not for the preſent herein finde a party equal to that of the League, and do much doubt if all of a contrary conceit, ſhould be declared Criminals, there would hardly be any acquitted in this Kingdom. Howſoever, I hold my ſelf much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged unto you, in conferring ſo liberally that upon me, you ſo well know I want, and for beſtowing all your colours and mercurial mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to make me ſeem beautifull: I will be well adviſed how I fall out with him who flatters me, and in the love I bear my ſelf, I ſhall at all times ſuffer a rival with much ſatisfaction. Since a certain Gentleman in <hi>Germany</hi> pleaſeth himſelf in being ſtiled <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſince thoſe who have no real Patrimonies, tickle themſelves with meer Titles and Arms: by the like reaſon may I imagine my ſelf to be the man you will needs have me, and receive from your courteſie the qualities my Nativity hath not affoarded me. But to diſblame both of us, I beſeech you hereafter to have more care of my modeſty, and not to put me in danger either to loſe it, or not to believe you. It is no leſs then to wrong the Angels, to call other ſpirits then theirs divine; yea, all the Celeſtial Court is ſenſible of ſuffering that name to fall to ground. For my part, I am ſo far from freeing my ſelf of humane defects, as I do
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:120345:53"/>
abſolutely avow, there is not any more imperfect than I am, no not ſo much as blinkards and maimed perſons. I eſpie faults enough, on which ſide ſoever I ſee my ſelf, and my wit is ſo disfurniſhed of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign perfections, as I hold no man for learned, if he be not adorned with thoſe abilities whereof I am ignorant; yea, even in that whereof you ſuppoſe me to have a perfect underſtanding: I have in truth no more than meer doubts and conjectures, ſo as if there were a man of perfect Eloquence to be found at the Worlds end, I would go in pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage on purpoſe to ſee one contrary to <hi>N. N.</hi> To ſpeak truely, there is great difference between filling the ear with ſome pleaſing ſound, and expreſſing the fancies of Artizans and Clowns according to <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi> rules; and in reigning over the ſpirits of men by force of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and to ſhare the government of the World with Conquerours and Lawfull <hi>Kings.</hi> I have not the preſumption to ſuppoſe I am arrived at this point; but I likewiſe think few have attained thereto, and the <hi>Phyloſophers</hi> Stone were with more eaſe to be extracted, than the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence I propoſe to my ſelf. It is as yet a kinde of <hi>Terra incognita,</hi> and which hath not been diſcovered together with the <hi>Indies.</hi> The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> themſelves could onely recover the bare image, as they did of thoſe Territories, over which they Triumphed by a falſe Title: Yea, <hi>Greece</hi> her ſelf how vainly ſoever ſhe boaſted thereof, yet ſeized ſhe onely upon the ſhadow, not ſeeing the ſubſtance: So as upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter divers have poſſeſſed others with that conceit, being firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived themſelves; and are obliged to the reſtitution of an ill acquired reputation. Many of our friends have fallen into the like errours; I will not name them, fearing to aſtoniſh at the firſt ſight, all ſuch to whom you ſhall ſhew this <hi>Letter;</hi> or leaſt I ſhould publiſh odious truths. It ſhall ſuffice I tell you by the way, that if to attain perfect Eloquence, it ſufficed onely to weary our hands with Writing, none could therein any way compare with our Practitioners and Pen-clerks. Yet is there not any reaſon why thoſe, who perform poor things, ſhould draw their weakneſs to their own advantage, or imagine I flatter them. A man is as well damned for one ſingle deadly ſin, as for a thouſand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance; nor is it the ſtrength of their judgement, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them from committing many faults, but the onely barrenneſs of their wits which enables them not to write many books.

                     </head>
                     <p>I Underſtand ſome have taxed me for ſaying (in my laſt <hi>Letter</hi> unto you) the ſpirits of Angels; ſince Angels being all ſpirits, it ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them to be two inſeperable terms: But to let ſuch men ſee how ill grounded their Objection is, (and I ſuppoſe our judgements will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in agree) it may pleaſe them to remember, that we call Angels ſpirits, to diſtinguiſh them from bodies, being a far different ſignification from what the word <hi>Spirit</hi> importeth, when we take it for that part of the Soul which underſtandeth, reaſoneth, and imagineth, and which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſo different effects in the Soul of a fool, and that of a diſcreet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Queſtionleſs (even among Angels themſelves) there may be a difference found between the ſpirits of ſome, and otherſome of them, to wit, in the faculty of Ratiotination and Comprehenſion: Since thoſe of the laſt order are not illuminated, but by means of them of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent ranks, and ſo of the reſt even to the firſt; which have a far more ſublime intelligence then the inferiour Orders, which as no man (how ſmally ſoever ſeen in the <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> will doubt of) come as far ſhort of the underſtanding the firſt Order is indued with, as they do of their degree. We are therefore to admit of this difference, and ſay, that an Angel is doubtleſs a Spirit, to wit, he is not a body: but withall that an Angel hath moreover a ſpirit, namely, this faculty of knowing, and conceiving either leſſer, or more large, according to the priviledge of his Order. So as if a ſpirit hath no other ſignification then a ſimple and incompoſed ſubſtance, this inequality were not to be found among the Angels, being equally ſimple, and far from all compoſition and mixture. When then I ſay it was a wrong done to Angels to call any other ſpirits divine ſave onely theirs: I take the word <hi>Spirit</hi> in its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſignification, and thereby ſeperate it from the Angel, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the ſimple ſubſtance, and nature Angellical from that faculty of the Soul termed the underſtanding. But that one may not ſay, the ſpirit of Angels, becauſe they are all ſpirit, is a reaſon very reproveable, and whereto there wanteth nothing but verity to make it no untruth; for that beſides the ſpirit, or underſtanding affoarding to Angels ſo eminent a knowledge of divine things, they are likewiſe indued with will, cauſing them to love what they know, and with memory dayly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſomething to their natural intellect. But admitting I ſhould yield to whatſoever theſe my reprehendors would have, and that I limit the word ſpirit within the bounds of its firſt ſignification, I ſhould ſtill have the better of it. For in truth our ordinary manner of conception can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly repreſent Angels without bodies, yea, and the Church it
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:120345:54"/>
ſelf affoardeth them ſo fair, beatifull, and perfect ones, that from thence the beſt Poets ordinarily pick their Compariſons to pourtraite the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt beauties. Beſides, if in holy writ, mention be often made of the ſpirit of God, even before he aſſumed our corporal ſubſtance, and in a ſence which could not be underſtood of the third perſon in Trinity, why may not I as juſtly ſpeak of the ſpirits of Angels, being in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Gods ſpirit, no better then earth, and material; and which approacheth not by many degrees unto the ſimplicity and purity of this majeſterial cauſe, being as the Mother to all the reſt. You ſee here, that (howſoever) it is very dangerous to ſtudy by half parts, or to underſtand ſome ſmall matter more then thoſe who never were at School; yet is it out of ſuch men as theſe, that Noveliſts and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious perſons are raiſed; yea, and all the reſt, who have reaſon enough to doubt, but not ſcience ſufficiently to determine rightly.</p>

                     <p>YOu have anticipated what I intended to ſay, and have not left for me in all Rhetorick, either complement or commendations to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn you. This is to force ingratitude by exceſs of obligation, and to reduce me to the neceſſity of being indebted unto you after I be dead. In truth it were neceſſary I had the power to promiſe you felicity and Paradiſe, in requital of the vows and ſacrifices you offer unto me, and that I were in caſe to be your advocate, inſtead of being thus put to a ſtand to anſwer you. It may be you have a minde in ſuch ſort to diſguiſe me to my ſelf, as I ſhall not hereafter know who I am, but be forced to forget my own name, by cauſing me to imagine I am not the ſame man I was yeſterday. Proceed at your pleaſure to deceive me in this ſort, for I am reſolved not to conteſt with you in this kinde, to the Worlds end: nor to arm my ſelf againſt an enemy, who onely throws Roſes at my head. I ſhould be very glad all my life would paſs in ſuch pleaſing dreams, and that I might never awake, for fear of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth to my prejudice. But for the attaining this happineſs, it is neceſſary I do quite contrary to your advice, and never quit my Countrey-houſe, where none comes to enter into compariſons, or conteſt with me, for the advantage I have over bruit beaſts, or my Lackeys. I agree with you that it is the Court-voice which either ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth or condemneth all, and that out of its light, things though never ſo perfect, have no appearance: But I know not whether it were
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:120345:54"/>
my beſt, to make that my own caſe; ſince I fear left my preſence there, will rather prejudice my reputation &amp; your judgement, then make good your poſition. Upon the matter, if there be any tollerable parts in me, they appear ſo little outwardly, as I had need have my breaſt opened to diſcover them: And in concluſion you will finde a ſufficient obligation for me, to have you think my Soul is more eloquent then my diſcourſe, &amp; that the better part of my virtue is concealed: Yet ſince my promiſe is paſt, I muſt reſolve for <hi>Paris,</hi> though it prove as ſtrange a place unto me, as if I were out of the World, or as though they ſhould chaſe raw Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers thence, as they do corrupt Stateſ-men. To tell you plainly how the caſe ſtands, I am none of thoſe who ſtudy the ſlighteſt actions of their lives, and who uſe Art in all they do, or do not. I cannot light upon that accent, wherewith they authoriſe their follies, nor make of every mean matter a myſtery by whiſpering it in the ear: And leſs do I know how to palliate my faults; or make ſhew of an honeſt man, if really I be not ſo: Now though I could make my ſelf capable of theſe Arts, yet would it anger me ſhrewdly, if after having paſſed nine Ports, and abidden many back-caſts to get thither, to be at laſt ſtayed at the Tenth: Nay, ſhould I chance to get admittance; what a Hell were it for me to come into a Countrey where Hats are not made to cover heads, and where all men grow crooked with extream cringeing. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider therefore, whether this humour of mine would ſure with the place where you are; or if a man whoſe points and garters ſeem pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous unto him, and who findes it a difficult matter to obey Gods Commandments, and the Kings Edicts, can be drawn to be obliged to new Laws, or procure to himſelf a third ſervitude. In the ſtare where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I now am, all the Princes in the World act Comedies to make me ſport. I enjoy all the Riches of Nature, from the Heavens to River-waters, and I eaſily obtain of my moderate ſpirit, what I cannot attain unto by the liberality of Fortune. This being thus, will you perſwade me to change thoſe benefits none envy, with your fears, hopes, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicions; or not think it fit I value liberty, for which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have made War (now this fifty years) againſt the King of <hi>Spain?</hi> But ſince I have paſſed my word, I am not reſolved to revoke it; yet when I muſt needs bid adieu to my Woods and ſolitary places, which have thaught me ſo many good things, and quit this inchanted Palace of mine, where all my thoughts are reall inſpirations; I ſhall have a great conflict within me, to keep my word with you. I will believe none but your ſelf, who beſt know whether or no I have reaſon to love this priſon my Father builded for me, or this little ſpot of Land, where there is no defect but a Fountain of Gold and other unneceſſary things; there being elſe ſufficient here to ſatisfie a ſober Perſon; I muſt confeſs the laſt great rains have blemiſhed all the beauty abroad: And Winter

which by right ſhould be condemned never to depart from <hi>Swedland,</hi> is already come to croſs the content I formerly enjoyed: But howſoever, there are yet pleaſing remedies to avoid theſe preſent incommodities. The perfumes I burn, and whereof I am as prodigal, as though I exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tribute from the Countries from whence they come, maketh me the leſs to miſs the ſweetneſs of the Spring: And a great fire reſembling the brighteſt beauty, which I term the Sun of the night, and dark dayes, watcheth at all hours in my Chamber, and giveth light to my reſt, as well as to my Studies. Before this witneſs (which I never looſe ſight of) all Nature is the ſubject of my meditation; &amp; I conceive works, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily may merit a place in your Library, &amp; to be choſen Citizens of that Divine Republick. I know not what men do moſt eſteem in books, but I am confident, that in this I compoſe, <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Majeſty,</hi> ſhall appear ſo evenly tempered, as none ſhall therein finde any thing either favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of cowardize or cruelty. I take and make uſe of the art of Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; as they would have done from me, had I been the firſt man living. But I have no ſervile dependancy upon their conceptions, nor am I born their vaſſal, to follow no other laws or examples, ſave theirs: To the contrary (if I deceive not my ſelf) my invention is far more happy then my imitation; and as there have been in our age divers new Stars diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, till this preſent unperceived; ſo I in matter of Eloquence, ſeek out ſingularities, hitherto unknown to any. It is certain, and you know it as well as my ſelf, you who know good things when you ſee them, and who are the Author of divers; that there are none ſo ſevere <hi>Muſes</hi> as the <hi>French,</hi> nor any tongue more hating affectation, &amp; bare appearances of things then ours. All kinde of ornaments therefore are not propper for her: and her purity is at ſuch odds with the exorbitant licence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther languages, that a <hi>French</hi> vice in this kinde, is often made a forraign virtue. But (in this caſe) we are to take advice of the underſtanding &amp; care; and for my part, I have for my pattern herein, the <hi>Idea</hi> of the great Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> as though he were preſent and privy to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, or as if he at all times received or rejected them, as they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be either good or otherwiſe: But to tell you the truth, I know not well which way I paſs by this tedious and untroden path, or what uſe I intend to make of theſe ſo many impertinent ſpeeches. But I am as often out of my way, in the allies of my hermitage, &amp; I have many times much uſe of a man, to let me know whether it be day, or night, and to order my times and actions; yet would I have you know, I do not uſually fall into ſuch errours, but onely before ſuch as I love and honour, as I do you; at all other times, be it in my viſits, or in my Letters, I will be well adviſed, how I ſuffer the end to come far ſhort of the <hi>Exordium;</hi> and from the firſt word, I make all the haſte I may to come to</p>

But above all things I intreat you not to ſuffer a ſuppoſed wiſdom to reſtrain you within particular reſpects and petty conſiderations, which may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you from ſpeaking high in what concerns me. Fear not to ſhew your ſelf my ſure friend, for it is neither theft, nor throat-cutting; and of the two extreamities of defect and exceſs, it is better to fall into the faireſt and leaſt faculty. Otherwiſe if friendſhip ſhould never appear, but remain at all times as a recluſe, what better uſe can we draw thence then of hatred alike hidden? and at the moſt what uſe is there to be made thereof, but onely for the pleaſure of converſation, and neceſſity of commerce? But I will leave this diſcourſe whereof I hope you have no uſe, to aſk you ſome news of the little man you ſometimes ſee, and who imagineth the <hi>King</hi> bereaveth him of all ſuch Offices as he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon <hi>Mounſieur de Luines.</hi> I make no queſtion but he dayly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth both Soul and body, for that he is not alwayes at his Maſters elbow, nor is ſo ordinarily ſeen at the <hi>Loover,</hi> as the ſteps of the great ſtairs, or the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> Hall.

                     <p>I Beſeech you reſerve your counſel for thoſe who are not as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; and go perſwade the Count <hi>Maurice</hi> to marry, and beget Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains for another age. As for me, I love both ſolitarineſs and ſociety, but will not be continually tied to either. If my Father had been of my minde, I had remained where I was before he got me. I imagine the party you deſire to beſtow on me, is fair; but ſtay awhile, and ſhe will not be ſo: She is no fool; but happily more witty then is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for an honeſt woman to be: She is rich, bun my liberty is unprizea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. So as to make me alter my reſolution, there is no other means then an expreſs commandment from God, with this propoſition, either of death, or a wife. Thoſe creatures at <hi>Paris</hi> are ordinarily ſo cunning, and well practiſed, they finde nothing ſtrange the firſt night they are married: and here, they have not wit enough to give their bodies right motion; but in all places they make men alike miſerable, as do <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, War,</hi> or <hi>Poverty.</hi> To tell you freely how the matter ſtands, I will not dayly diſturb my ſelf in telling my Miſtreſſes hairs, for fear ſhe ſhould beſtow them as favours upon her familiars; or to be jealous leſt all the women who come to ſee her, were young men diſguiſed. I cannot endure, that in my abſence ſhe and her gallant drink to the health of their Cuckold, and that I be the ſubject of all their chat. And on the other ſide, it were far worſe, were ſhe chaſte, yet a ſcowld, and to be troubled with an enemy to aſſault me day and night. I rather affect a tractable vice, then a tyrannical virtue: But if there be any other remedy, I will not be reduced to ſuch ſtraights, as to chuſe the leaſt of evils; ſince there is not any of this nature, I eſteem not unſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable. In a word <hi>Philander,</hi> my Neighbours example doth not a little terrifie me: he hath begotten ſo many dumb, blinde, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed creatures, he is able to furniſh a reaſonable Hoſpital. I will not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:120345:56"/>
be bound to love Monſters, becauſe they are mine, and were I aſſured not to be defective in this kinde, I could well forbear having children; who if they be wicked, will deſire my death; if wiſe, expect it, if the honeſteſt living, yet will they now and then reflect upon it. But it may be (you will ſay) if my reſolution were generally received, the Sea ſhould be no longer charged with ſhips, and the Land would become deſert. To this <hi>Philander</hi> I anſwer, that ſince the world is not always to endure, it were far better to have virtue become its <hi>Catastrophe,</hi> then any thing elſe; ſince it cannot finde a more fair and honeſt concluſion, then a general abſtinence in this kinde.</p>

I who have a perfect experience of worldly affairs, would as ſoon comfort you for the loſs you received by the death of your great Grandfather, (ſo many years dead before you were born) as for the late danger of your Feaver, ſince it is now gone. The beſt is, the Phiſicians have not ſo far exhauſted you, but there yet remains bloud ſufficient, to beſtow part thereof in your Miſtreſſes ſervice, and to fill the World with your offences; ſo long as the ruines of your head may be repaired, and your beauty budd again with the next Roſes, there is nothing loſt hitherto; but indeed if inſtead of your former head, you carried the figure of a ruſty Murrion, or rotten Pumpian, I ſhould much pitty you in ſuch a plight, and would preſently add you to the number of decayed buildings. Now when all is done <hi>Philander,</hi> it is but a little water and earth mingled together, we ſtudy to conſerve with all the maximes of wiſedom, and all the rules of Phiſick. Let us reflect I pray you, upon our better part, and hereafter labour as well to cure our ſelves of Vice, as of the Feaver. It is that image of God we defaced by our own hands, we ought to repair; and our firſt innocency is the thing it behoveth us to aſk at his hands, rather then our former health. For my part, I am abſolutely reſolved to lead a new life, and to take no other care but for my Souls health, and to procure the ſame for others.

                     <p>I Am much troubled to finde the cauſe of your tears; to impute them to the death of your Huſband, is happily but the bare pretext. It is not to be imagined that death which cauſeth the moſt beautifull things to become offenſive to the dayes brightneſs, and affrighteth thoſe who formerly admired them; ſhould make that man pleaſing unto you, who was never ſo to any. Yet you ſeem with him to have loſt all, and do ſo cunningly counterfeit the afflicted, I can hardly believe what I ſee: Can it be poſſible, you ſhould be thus peſtered to ſupport your good fortune with patience, or be really ſo ſorrowfull for the loſs of a poor gouty fellow, for whoſe over-long living I ſhould rather have thought it fit to comfort you? But if this be not thus, what do you with all this great mourning, wherein you plunge your ſelf, and this mid-night ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver removing from your Chamber? I muſt confeſs I was never more aſtoniſhed, then to finde ſuch an Equipage of ſadneſs about you, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſuch elaborate actions, and ſo conſtrained counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; and without jeſting <hi>Olympa,</hi> (after this I have ſeen) there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth nothing for the full expreſſion of a fained paſſion, but onely to wear black ſmocks, and to be attended by <hi>Moors.</hi> Yet is it time, or never to return to your right ſences, and to conclude your Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, let me intreat you to leave off all theſe ſower faces to fools. Caſt off this black vail which hinders me from ſeeing you, and conſider that five foot of ground, is worth you two thouſand pounds by the year. To raiſe ſuch a rent, the revenues of half ſome Kingdom were hardly ſufficient; nor can you tax me for not ſpeaking herein the truth, ſince I have it from your own mouth. Is it not almoſt incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, ſo ſmall a corner of earth, ſhould yield ſo large a revenew. I doubt not but divers will ſuppoſe it bears Pearls or Diamonds. But I had almoſt forgot the moſt important buſineſs I am to impart unto you, and whereupon I firſt intended to write. I muſt therefore ſay, you are to have a ſpecial care, never to repair the loſs you have lately received, aſſuring your ſelf there is no one man in the World worthy to enjoy you privatively: you ſhall be anſwerable for thoſe excellent qualities Nature &amp; Art have conferred upon you for the commanding of men, if you ſay you cannot live without ſubmitting your ſelf to one. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Olympa,</hi> you ought not ſuffer the vain ambition to be wiſe to a great Signiour to tranſport you, or the advantage of entring into the <hi>Loover</hi>

in Carroch, to cauſe you quit the happineſs you have to be Queen of your ſelf. How much Gold ſoever one beſtow in fetters, and how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſoever the ſervitude be, yet aſſure your ſelf they are but a couple of bad matters. Of late there was not any part of your body, whereof another was not maſter, he would examine your very dreams and thoughts: It was not in your power to diſpoſe of one ſingle hair, nay he robbed you of your very name. See here <hi>Olympa,</hi> what it is to have a Huſband, and what you torment your ſelf for with ſuch prodigal tears. Me thinks it were all you could, or ought to do were he revived; or if the news of his death were doubtfull.</p>

                     <p>I Muſt needs diſabuſe you <hi>Cryſolita,</hi> and inform you better in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of that old <hi>Haxtris,</hi> you ſuppoſed to be a very Saint. Firſt, you are to underſtand, ſhe is extracted out of her Mothers ſins, nor was ever any Yirginity ſo britle, as that ſhe brought into this World. It is very likely ſhe hath loſt all remembrance of any ſuch matter: But peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of thoſe dayes, ſtick not openly to affirm, that the firſt time ſhe had liberty to go abroad, (at her coming home) ſhe miſt her Gloves and Maiden-head. After this, her beauty augmenting with riper years, ſhe drew the eyes of all <hi>Italy</hi> upon her; and ſold than fifty times at Court, ſhe had formerly loſt at School: But ſince then, ſhe is arrived to an experience, far ſurpaſſing that of the Lord Chancellour, or the Popes Datary: &amp; when I ſhall tell you, ſhe knoweth whether there be more pleaſure in a circumciſed Courtizan, then in a Chriſtian; and that ſhe hath experienced the activity of <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> yet ſhall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late but half the ſtory. So it is, that now after ſhe hath filled <hi>Limbo</hi> with her paricidial leachery, and been three-ſcore years a Lectoreſs in vice, ſhe would make you confident of her converſion: Yet am I credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly informed, that not having now any thing worth the loſing, ſhe is turned <hi>Solicitreſs,</hi> to entice others to vice; nor is there any chaſtity can eſcape her, if it take not ſanctuary in the <hi>Carmelites.</hi> She cannot endure there ſhould be one honeſt Woman in the whole Citie; this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering her as much, as though ſhe robbed her, or had declared her ſelf her enemy. Yet is this the <hi>Saint</hi> you ſo much talk of <hi>Cryſolita,</hi> and the very ſame old Madame, from whom you promiſed me ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. Now I, who know her very heart, write unto you, what here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after you ought to believe: for let her make what ſhew ſhe will, yet I
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:120345:58"/>
know ſhe is as far from her converſion, as from her youth. The <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins</hi> themſelves could not cauſe her to paſs her word to turn honeſt Woman the next grand Jubile; for inſtead of a better anſwer, ſhe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told them, ſhe had not as yet diſpatched her buſineſs, and could well ſtay till another, which will happen about eight and twenty years hence.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>WE are not ſeperated either by Seas or Mountains: your lodging and mine touch, yet finde I it an impoſſibility to ſee you. If you were at <hi>Japan,</hi> or in the Kingdom of <hi>China,</hi> I would reſolve my ſelf for thoſe places, and I ſhould finde ſome Bark, or other bound for that voyage: think not I diſſemble, there is not any ſhelve in all the <hi>Sea,</hi> not hazard to undergo in ſo dangerous a voyage, whereof I have not leſs apprehenſion, then the meeting this little brother of yours. But if may be it is yourſelf, who make theſe difficulties, I ſuppoſe, to ariſe elſewhere. You are glad you want no pretext, on purpoſe to vex me when you pleaſe. If it be ſo <hi>Clorinda,</hi> let me be ſo much obliged unto you, as to conceal it. I had far rather be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, then know the truth to my prejudice: Either my company is troubleſom unto you, or you reſerve your favours for ſome other friend. Howſoever, I am contented to believe your Mother is ſick, and that you cannot quit her Chamber: there are no excuſes ſo coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, I accept not for currant, ſo long as they relieve my ſpirits: Conſidering the power you have over me, it is a ſmall matter to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your ſelf in making me conceive the beſt. Yet muſt I thank you <hi>Clorinda,</hi> for violating Juſtice ſo formerly, and faining reaſons with purpoſe to erre punctually. By this means you will not ſuffer me ſo much as to ſeem miſerable, and you cozen me ſo cunningly, I can neither bemoan my ſelf, nor beſhrew you. Yet is it impoſſible I can for ever conceal my ſenſibilities: What violence ſoever I offer to my humour, it can no longer be contained. To be ſhort <hi>Clorinda,</hi> if you loved me as you ſay, you would not live with me in the faſhion you do; but I ſhould receive from you real favours, not vain appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances; and ſay what you will, we ſhall meet alone once in our lives: I beſeech you let not this word affright you, for if any ſhould finde us in this manner, none will imagine we conſpire againſt the <hi>King,</hi> or ſuſpect I read <hi>Magick</hi> to you. Innocent actions carry their warrant with them, nor is there any neceſſity that two cannot be together without making a third. Believe me <hi>Clorinda,</hi> if we ſhut our ſelves for three hours into a private Chamber, the moſt ſlanderous will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine, I either let you ſee the errours you are in, or that you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter ſome Medicine unto me for my <hi>Feaver.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>I Know not whether I ſhould term it ſlackneſs, or patience, the ſmall reſiſtance I make againſt the diſpleaſures you do me; it may be, you are reſolved to ſee how far my fidelity will extend, and to extort the utmoſt proofs thereof: yet is it better <hi>Clorinda</hi> to endure injuſtice, then to act it, and to be rather the Martyr, then the Tyrant. Shew your wit, I beſeech you by inflicting dayly new torments upon me, and avoid all occaſions of obliging me, with as much care as I ſeek thoſe to ſerve you. I have prepared my ſpirits againſt all the bad occ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>rents can happen that way. There is nothing I cannot endure, if it comes from you, your ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me onely excepted: But herein I muſt tell you, I am ſo tender, as I am wounded with the leaſt touch. I would not purchaſe the <hi>Kings</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, if he affoard it me in rough terms; nor would I accept of his Graces, were I forced to gain them in with the forgoing the thing I affect more then his Kingdom. You underſtand me ſufficiently what I mean hereby, and the juſt occaſion I have to complain; but ſtill you will have me in the wrong, nor do I doubt, but you will accuſe me of your crime: But ſpeak truely, have you no apprehenſion, that he whom you have ſo often injured, ſhall at length grow weary of his ſufferings, and leſt he ſhould loſe all fear, together with his hopes. You might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider <hi>Clorinda,</hi> that I am not poſſeſſed with ſlight paſſions, and how your ſelf hath told me ere now; that if God ſhould arm me with thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der when I am angry, within four and twenty hours there would be neither Towers nor Pavillions ſtanding in any place: Wherefore to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond your conceit; know (if that were) one while the fire ſhould fall upon all jealous perſons, and by and by burn all the Mothers and little brothers in a whole Province. And doubtleſs, if I did you no harm, yet would I put you into ſuch a fright, you ſhould be forced to hide your ſelf under ground, and come to meet me in ſome Cave. But I gain much by theſe glorious brags, or by my ſeeming ſeverity: I aſſure my ſelf, you mock me and my threats. It is long ſince I have ſhewed you the way how to catch me, and you know the means how to reduce me to my former duty: I muſt confeſs I am not of ſufficient force to conteſt with <hi>Clorinda:</hi> her kiſſes have power to expell all ſpleen, even out of the ſpirit of an <hi>Italian</hi> Prince, for the greateſt injury can be offered him. Nay, they would force the Duke <hi>de Main</hi> to forſake his Arms in the hotteſt of his Martiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts: Wherefore I pray you, let us agree upon a buſineſs, which of neceſſity muſt be concluded: how diſadvantagious ſoever the peace be I treat of with you, yet ſhall I at all times gain that which
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:120345:60"/>
otherwiſe I ſhould loſe in your abſence. I have therefore preſented my complaints, with purpoſe to receive ſatisfactions: I am angry onely to the end you may appeaſe me. I will tell you to morrow, that I am come to oblige you, to take the pains to receive me.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>I See well <hi>Clorinda,</hi> I do but loſe my labour, and that if were an eaſier matter to return Ice into Coales, then to kindle love in you: All I can ſay, makes no impreſſion in your thoughts, you will not ſo much as hear reaſon, becauſe it reſteth on my ſide. Well <hi>Clorinda,</hi> I muſt reſolve my ſelf for the worſt of events, and ſtay the time till your wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles affoard me revenge for all the wrongs you have done me. Think not this tyrannical power of your beauty, will laſt to the Worlds end. Time which overturneth Empires, and preſcribeth limits to all things, will uſe you as it doth the reſt of fair workmanſhips. I pray have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, if I take upon me to tell you this bad news; for I am not to day in the humour to flatter any. Though it would raiſe choler in you, yet muſt I ſay, you will grow ſtale, and be then no more what you now are. I doubt not of your ſighes when you reflect upon this change, or that your very imagination is not ſenſible of ſome ſorrow; yet ſhall this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen <hi>Clorinda,</hi> there is not an hour paſſeth, which impaires not ſome part of your face. But the time will come, when your Looking-glaſs will more ſcare you, then a Judge doth a Fellon: your fore-head will flie to the Crown of your head; your cheeks will fall beneath your chinne, and your eyes of thoſe dayes, ſhall turn of the ſame colour your lips are at this hour. I could willingly wiſh out of my love unto you, my rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were not ſo true as it is. But ſince I have quitted all complacency, there is no means to make me ſilent. <hi>Clorinda,</hi> the Sun is ſtill beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, though ready to ſet; and the Autumne agreeable, though ſprinkled with ſome Snow, but we enjoy no happy years, but the firſt of youth: And be as carefull of your ſelf as is poſſible, yet can you not conſerve your complexion, and acquire experience. Will you have me ſay more, and acquaint you with what I underſtood by a ſtranger, with whom I have converſed all this day? You are to know there is not any part of the World ſo remote, which his curioſity hath not carried him, nor rarity in Nature, he hath not carefully obſerved: He hath ſeen Mountains which burn perpetually without diminiſhing; he hath land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Ilands, never reſting in one place; he hath ſeen natural Sea-men;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:120345:60"/>
but he ſwore unto me, who among all theſe miracles, he never yet ſaw a beautifull old Woman. The Moral hereof is, that you muſt make uſe of your youth, and gather Noſe-gayes before the Roſes wither. None knows better then your ſelf, that to be fair, is to raign without having need either of Guards or Forts. You ſee you are the Worlds ambition, no man deſiring further happineſs then <hi>Clorinda:</hi> But think not to continue this abſolute authority, or this general eſteem, by other means then you compaſſed them; and aſſure your ſelf, that when you have no further attractions then an eloquent tongue, no man will ſeek for them among the ſurrowes of your face. A Woman had need be perfectly provided of virtue, to repair the ruines of her beauty. All the wit and experience in the World is fruitleſs, when ſhe falls into this ſtate, nor can any thing hinder her from being hated, but onely to change Sex. Remember then <hi>Clorinda,</hi> not to expect to live, when you are as good as dead; nor do not ſpend that time in deliberating, which ſhould be imployed in doing. You are now of years both to give, and receive contentment, and we are in the Moneth, wherein each Creature turneth amorous; not excepting Lions, Tygers, or Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. I intreat you therefore, not to ſhew your ſelf the ſole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible creature in the World: ſuffer your ſelf to be convinced by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſince you cannot reſiſt the ſame but to your own diſadvantage: You have no ſubject to be ſuſpicious of what I ſay; for I adviſe you to nothing <hi>Clorinda,</hi> wherein I would not willingly joyn with you in the accompliſhment.</p>

                        <hi>CLorinda,</hi> your Religion muſt needs be amiſs, otherwiſe I ſhould ſee you now and then at Church: But I think it were an eaſier matter to convert a whole Nation, then to diſpoſe you to give me content. The cauſe why you perſiſt in your own opinion, is, becauſe it is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to mine. Well then, I muſt depart without ſpeaking with you, and am barred from affoarding to my affection, what good manners would have exacted of me, though I had not loved you: Truely I know not in what manner to ſuffer ſo wounding a diſpleaſure, nor am I ſo well acquainted with my ſelf, as to paſs my word for him I ſpeak of in this occaſion. All I can ſay unto you <hi>Clorinda,</hi> is, that the onely way to rid me out of my pain, is to perform the thing I have ſo often propoſed unto you, and to make your ſelf capable of a ſtrong reſolution. Never did any Prince enterpriſe a more glorious voyage, then mine ſhall be,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:120345:61"/>
if you will make one: and truely, I ſee not why you ſhould make any difficulty herein, the longer your journey is, the further ſhall you be removed from tyranny. It is a Monſter you ought to fly from, even to the Worlds end, and with whom to be in peace, is dangerous: Will you fear to come into the Countrey of Comedies, Painting, and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, or into a place where Women are by many as highly eſteemed as Saints; without flattering you, I muſt affirm, you ſhall ſeem over much to neglect your own quiet, if you let ſlip to favourable an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to procure it. It is time <hi>Clorinda,</hi> you make it appear what you are, and that we begin the Hiſtorie of our adventures. If you love, all things will be eaſie for you; there is no more difficulty to paſſe the <hi>Alpes,</hi> then to go up into your Chamber: Nor doubt you that the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waters will become ſweet, if you be not ſatisfied in that they be ſmooth. But I am much affraid I ſhall not receive from you the ſatisfaction I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. You will tell me (as you uſe) we muſt let Nature work, and that ſhe will ſoon revenge us of our enemies. I ſuppoſe <hi>Clorinda,</hi> all this may happen, but it is no reaſon we ſhould be obliged to the Tyrants death for our liberty, but to our own reſolutions.</p>

                     <p>I Attend you here in the ſeaſon of <hi>Jaſmins</hi> and <hi>Roſes,</hi> and do ſend you a taſte of the pleaſures of <hi>Rome,</hi> for fear you be poyſoned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, upon your firſt approach. We are here in the Countrey of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities, and to be happy in this place, it ſufficeth not to be blinde. The <hi>Sun</hi> hath yet heat enough to ripen us Reaſins, and to affoard us Flowers: all the <hi>Winter</hi> falls upon the neighbouring Mountains, to the end we may not want <hi>Snow</hi> in <hi>August.</hi> But if you deſire I ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert my diſcourſe unto more ſerious matters, and conceal nothing from you: I muſt tell you, there is no place under Heaven, where <hi>Virtue</hi> is ſo near a Neighbour to <hi>Vice,</hi> or where <hi>good</hi> is ſo mingled with <hi>Evil:</hi> We here behold miracles on the one ſide, and monſters on the other; and at the ſame time when ſome Diſcipline themſelves, others run to debauches of all kindes. Beſides, there is as profound a peace here, as in that part of the Air elevated above the <hi>Windes</hi> and <hi>Storms. Idleneſs</hi> in this place, is an honeſt mans ordinary vocation; and to ſave half the World, no man will riſe haſtily from Table, for fear of troubling di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. If you chance to ſee any with ſkars in their faces, do not thereupon imagine they have purchaſed them either in Wars, or in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their honour, for theſe are onely their Miſtreſſes favours; but in recompence of ſuch refractory humours, you ſhall ſee that here, the ſanctity whereof doth illuſtrate the whole Church. It is their fervent prayers which impetrate all advantages over <hi>Enemies:</hi> It is their faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which cauſe fruitfulneſs to flow upon the Earth: It is their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency which conſerveth the culpable from <hi>Eternal</hi> ruin. In a word, there are here ſuch excellent examples of <hi>Virtue,</hi> and ſo intiſing allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to <hi>Vice,</hi> that I will not marvel if you turn honeſt man here, and I will likewiſe willingly pardon you, if you do not ſo. Truly, as new <hi>Spain</hi> is the Province of Gold; and as <hi>Affrick</hi> affoards Lions, and <hi>France</hi> Souldiers; ſo is <hi>Italy</hi> the mother of thoſe things you beſt love. When you ſhall ſee theſe Female Creatures in their own Countrey, and compare their beauty with the bad faſhion of the maſculine <hi>Italians,</hi> I doubt not, but it will ſeem to you as well as to my ſelf, theſe Divine Women to have been created by themſelves, or to be Queens who have married their Grooms. The moſt part of thoſe beyond the Mounts have no more beauty then needs muſt, to excuſe them from being eſteemed ugly; and if there be ſome one whoſe face you could fancy, this ſhall happily be ſome deſolate Palace, or ſome well favoured beaſt. But here (for the moſt part) they are born Eloquent; and I
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:120345:62"/>
will tell you before hand, that in one and the ſame perſon, you ſhall finde both your <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Miſtreſs.</hi> For my part, I ingeniouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I do no longer live under <hi>Clorinda's</hi> regency, and all that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me in this place, is onely ſometimes to honour her memory. I expect you ſhould at this paſſage accuſe me of levity and diſloyalty, and that you could willingly revile me. But do you not think my ſighs muſt needs be ſurbated, in going every day four hundred leagues? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, being ſo far from her as I am, what know I, whether I love a dead body, or an Infidel. I have not received any favours from her, which are not rather marks of her virtues, then demonſtrations of her love. And had ſhe loſt all her liberality in that kinde, ſhe could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſs it. I am therefore onely obliged to my word, not to her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And as for that, I ſhould over-eſteem her, if I made more rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning thereof, then ſome <hi>Princes</hi> do of theirs, and I ſhould ſhew my ſelf over ſuperſtitious, if I valued what I onely whiſpered in her ear, to be of greater efficacie then Letters Pattents and Edicts. It is a point decided in <hi>Ovids</hi> Theology, that an hundred falſe Oaths from an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous perſon, amount not to half a deadly ſin, and that it is onely the God of Poets whom we offend by our perjury in that point. Now I will be judged by her ſelf, whether I having beſtowed my ſervice upon her, ſhe ſhould take it ill if another did reward me; or that I love ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be happy, then otherwiſe; or deſire rather to poſſeſs <hi>Lucretia,</hi> then to deſire <hi>Clorinda.</hi> Will ſhe have her tyranny extend even to the Churches patrimony, and that the Pope ſhare his temporal Authority with her? I do not believe ſhe hath any ſuch pretentions. For my part, I would ſhe knew I can no longer behold any beauty but naked, nor recive any but warm and moiſt kiſſes. I will tell you the reſt upon the banks of <hi>Tyber,</hi> and in theſe precious ruins whither I go to muſe once a day, and to tread in their ſteps who have led <hi>Kings</hi> in Triumph. If there were any means there to finde a little of <hi>Sylla's</hi> good fortune, or of <hi>Pompeis</hi> greatneſs, inſtead of the Medals we now and then meet with, I ſhould have a farther ſubject to invite you hither. Notwithſtanding, if you be yet your ſelf, and that by ſolemn vow you have forſaken the World, and the vanities thereof, aſſure your ſelf, that it is in this Countrey where felicity doth attend you: and that being once in this place, you will eſteem all thoſe as baniſhed perſons, whom you have left behinde you in <hi>France.</hi>

                     <p>I Send you the papers you have formerly ſeen, and whereto you have attributed ſo much, as I ſhould be aſhamed to aſſent thereto, were it not that I hold it leſs preſumption to believe I have merited the ſame, then to imagine I can have a flatterer of your faſhion. I had need be elevated to a more ſoveraign fortune then the ſtate of <hi>Kings,</hi> to expect complacency from a man, who could never be procured to approve evil: and of whoſe disfavour one can hardly finde other cauſe, then the onely truth he hath declared. Howſoever it be, ſince you are now in <hi>Lymoſin,</hi> and take not any journey in thoſe parts, without having a thouſand old debates to reconcile, and as many new ones to prevent, it is very propable, that after ſo pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full an imployment, and ſo great diſquiet of minde, my book will fall into your hands, juſt at ſuch time as you cannot finde any thing more tedious unto you, then what you come from treating of: For ſhould I preſume that in your pleaſant walks of <hi>Duretal,</hi> where all your minutes are pleaſing, and all your hours precious, there could be any time ſpare for me, and my works; it were as much as to be ignorant of the diverſions there attending you; or not to be acquainted with the great affluence of noble company, daily repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither, to viſite you. But were it ſo, that you had none with you, ſave onely the memory of your fore-paſſed actions, your ſolitarineſs hath no need of books to make it more pleaſing; nay, if all this were not, yet if you deſire to ſeek contentment out of your ſelf, you cannot finde any more pleaſing, then in the preſence of your Children, and particularly of that Divine daughter of yours, from whom I daily learn ſome miracle. It is therefore in her abſence, and in ſolitary walks, where I have the ambition to finde entertainment, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive gracious acceptance.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Should be inſenſible of publick good, and an enemy to <hi>France,</hi> had I not (as I ought) a true taſte of the good news your Foot-man brought me. I will not mention the Obligations I owe you, being no ſmall ones, if that be not a ſlight matter to be eſteemed by you: But ſince I make profeſſion to honour virtue even in the perſon of one departed, or an enemy; and at all times to ſide with the right, were there onely my ſelf and <hi>Juſtice</hi> for it, you may pleaſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, I complain in your behalf for the miſeries of our times, and that I am moſt joyfull to ſee you at this preſent, where all the World miſt you: Certainly your retirement from Court, hath been one of the faireſt pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of your life, during which, you have made it apparent you are the ſame in both fortunes: ſince I can witneſs, that no one word then paſſed from you unſuitable to your reſolution. Yet this rare virtue being there hidden, in one of the remote corners of the World, having but a very ſmall circuit to dilate it ſelf, muſt neceſſarily be contented with the ſatisfaction of your conſcience and ſlender teſtimonies: In the mean time the authority of your enemies hath been obnoxious to all honeſt eyes. There was no means to conceal from ſtrangers the States infirmities, or what reaſon to affoard them for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of ſo irreproachable a Miniſter; nor was there any who grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not, that by your abſence the <hi>King</hi> loſt ſo many hours and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. For my part, (my Lord) (reflecting upon you in that eſtate, it

ſeemed to me I ſaw <hi>Phidias,</hi> or ſome other of thoſe ancient Artiſts, their hands bound, and their coſtly materials, as Marble, Gold, or Ivory ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them. But now that better time ſucceed, each thing being again reduced to its place, it is time to rejoyce with all good <hi>French men,</hi> that you ſhall no more want matter, and that the <hi>King</hi> hath at length found how unuſefull your abſence hath been to his affairs: True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, be it that he content himſelf to govern his people wiſely, or that the afflictions of his poor Neighbours ſet near his heart, and that his <hi>Juſtice</hi> extend further then his Juriſdiction: No man doubts whatſoever he doth, but you ſhall be one of the principal inſtruments of his deſigns, and that as well <hi>Peace</hi> as <hi>War</hi> have equal uſe of your conduct. All men have well perceived, you have not contributed any thing to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the <hi>Kings</hi> treaſure, ſave onely your pure ſpirit, to wit, that part of the Soul ſeparated from the terreſtrial part, being free from paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which reaſoneth without either loving or deſiring; and that you have managed the Riches of the State with as great fidelity, as one ought to govern another mans goods, with as much care as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your own, and with as great ſcruple as we ought to touch ſacred things. But in truth it is no great glory for that man to have been faithfull to his Maſter, who knows not how to deceive any: And did I believe you were onely able to abſtain from ill, I would barely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend in you the Commencements of virtue. I therefore paſs further, and am aſſured, that neither the fear of death, which you have ſlighted in all ſhapes, and under the moſt dreadfull aſpects it could poſſibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, nor complacency which often overpaſſeth the beſt Counſels, to tranſport it ſelf to the moſt pleaſing ones; nor any private intereſt which makes us rather regard our ſelves, then the Publick; ſhall at all hinder you either from purpoſing, undertaking, or executing eminent matters, <hi>Poſterity</hi> which will peradventure judge of our age upon the report I ſhall make, will ſee more elſewhere then I can here relate, and I ſhall reſt ſufficiently ſatisfied, if you pleaſe to do me the honour, as to remember that mine affection is no Childe of your proſperity, and how in two contrary ſeaſons I have been equally</p>

But if this were not ſo, my reſentments are not of ſuch value with me, as not often to beſtow them upon more ſlender conſiderations then thoſe were which produced them; nor do my paſſions ſo tranſport me, but that I will at all times remain in the power of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I can defend a juſt cauſe, but in farther reſiſting what you deſire, I ſhould force right it ſelf to be in the wrong, were it on my ſide: And out of bare enmity which in ſome Common wealths hath been tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, I ſhould even paſs to Tyrannie, a thing odious to all men. Since our lives are momentary, it is no reaſon our paſſions ſhould be immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, or that men ſhould glut themſelves with revenge, whereof God hath as well forbidden the uſe, as the exceſs. It is a thing he hath ſoly reſerved to himſelf; and ſince none but he truely knoweth how to uſe this part of Juſtice, he would no more put it into the hands of men, then he doth Thunder and Tempeſts. Let us therefore ſtop in our firſt motions, for it is already too much to have begun. Let us not term the hardneſs of our hearts, Courage: and if you have prevented me in the overture of the peace we treat of, repent not your ſelf, ſince you have thereby bereaved me of all the honour there had been in acquiring it. Heretofore Magnanimity and Humility might have been eſteemed two contrary things, but ſince the Maxims of Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have been changed by the principles of <hi>Divinity,</hi> and that Pagan vices are become Chriſtian virtues, there are even weak actions a man of courage ought to practice; nor is true glorie any longer due to thoſe who have triumphed over <hi>innocents,</hi> but to thoſe <hi>Martyrs</hi> they have made, and to ſuch perſons whom they have oppreſſed. But to paſs from general conſiderations, to what is particular between you and me, it is no way likely, a religious man would diſturb the tranquility of his thoughts, or quit his converſation with God and Angels, to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with wicked Mortals, and to make himſelf a party in our diſorders. I ſhould likewiſe have leſs reaſon to ſeek for an enemy out of the World, wherein there are ſo many adverſaries to diſlike, and ſo many Rebels to ſubdue. Now (Father) whatſoever opinion you have had, and

notwithſtanding any thing I have ſaid in the beginning of this Letter, I never intended to commence any real War againſt you: I have not at all felt the emotion I ſhewed; all my choller being but artificial, when at any time certain of my ſpeeches ſeemed diſadvantagious unto you; ſo as I freely conſent, that what was written to <hi>Hydaſp,</hi> ſhall paſs as a flaſh of my brain, and not as any teſtimonie of my belief, onely to let men know, I had a deſire to ſhew how able I was to conteſt with truth, if I had no minde to ſide with it. This ſcience having been ſufficiently daring to undertake to perſwade, that a Quartan Ague was better then health: <hi>Rhetorick</hi> I ſay, which hath invented praiſes for <hi>Buſiris,</hi> made Apologies for <hi>Nero,</hi> and obliged all the people of <hi>Rome</hi> to doubt whether Juſtice were a good, or a bad thing, may yet in theſe dayes exerciſe it ſelf upon ſubjects wholy ſeparated from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinions, and by gracefull fictions, rather excite admiration in mens ſpirits, then exact any credence. It raiſeth Fantomes with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to deface them. It hath paintings and diſguiſements, to alter the purity of all worldly things: It changeth ſides without levity, it accuſeth innocencie without calumny: And to ſay truth, Painters and Stage-players are no way culpable of thoſe murthers we ſee repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in Pictures, or preſented upon Theaters; ſince therein the moſt cruel is the moſt juſt. None can juſtly accuſe thoſe of falſity, who make certain glaſſes which ſhew one thing for another: Errour in ſome caſes being more gracefull then truth. In a word, the life even of the greateſt Sages, is not altogether ſerious, all their ſayings are not Sermons, nor is all they write, either their laſt Teſtament, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their Faith. What can I ſay more? Can you imagine me to be ſo curious, as to condemne the guſt of all that great multitude, who flock to hear you every morning? Are you perſwaded that I and the people can never be of one minde? That will oppoſe my ſelf to the belief of honeſt men? to the approbation of Doctors? and to their authority who are eminent above others? No Father; I allow no ſuch liberty to my ſpirit: aſſure your ſelf, I eſteem you as I ought. I commend your zeal and learning, yea, were it truer then ever it was, that to compoſe tedious Volumnes, is no leſs then to commit great ſins: Yet if you oblige me to judge of yours by that you ſent unto me, I ſay it is very excellent in its kinde, and that I will no way hinder you from obtaining a Rank among the Fathers of theſe modern ages. But my teſtimony will not (I hope) become the onely fruit of your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; I wiſh with all my heart the converſion of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> may crown your indeavours. I am perſwaded, all the honour this World can affoard, ought to be eſteemed as nothing by thoſe who onely ſeek for the advancement of Gods glorie. I will therefore no farther dilate my ſelf upon this Subject, nor wrong holy things by prophane praiſes;

                     <p>THe Letter you pleaſed to ſend me from <hi>Rome,</hi> cauſed me to forget I was ſick, and I preſumed to ſolace my ſelf after three years of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, ever ſince news was brought me of <hi>Lucidors</hi> death, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of that fatal combate, wherein you could not but be a loſer, on which ſide ſoever the advantage happened. My Lord, I doubt not but your ſpirit though altogether ſtout and couragious, to ſupport your proper misfortunes, is yet mollified by the relation of their miſeries who love you, and where there is queſtion rather of ſhewing your good nature, or your conſtancy, you will quit one virtue to acquire another. I know well, that in the number of your goods, you reckon your friends in the firſt rank, allowing onely the ſecond place to your dignities, and to fifty thouſand Crowns rent which accompanies them; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently I aſſure my ſelf, you believe you are, as it were, grown poor by the loſs of a man who had relation unto you. But I am likewiſe moſt certain, how after the paſſing certain unpleaſant dayes out of the love you bare him; and having affoardeth him ſufficient Teſtimonies of your affection, he now expecting no further acknowledgement or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, you will at length call to minde, that it is the publick to whom you owe your cares and paſſions, and that you are not permitted far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to afflict a ſpirit which is no longer yours. Since the miſery of this age is ſo general, as it leaveth no one houſe without tears, nor any one part of <hi>Europe</hi> without trouble; and ſince Fortune is not of power to conſerve even her own workmanſhips, who are many of them fallen to ground: it muſt needs ſo happen (my Lord) that being of the World, you are to taſte of the fruits it produceth, and that you purchaſe at ſome hard rate, the good ſucceſſes daily attending you. But truely, the place where you are, and the great deſigns taking you up, may well furniſh you with ſo ſtrong and ſolide conſolations, as they need leave no work for others; and my Eloquence would come too late, ſhould I imploy it after your reaſon, which hath formerly perſwaded you, there being now neither precept nor Counſel in all humane wiſdom unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

to your view; and ſince neither <hi>Seneca,</hi> nor <hi>Epiotetus</hi> can ſay any thing ſave onely your thoughts; I had much rather ſend you divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments no way diſtaſtefull, then to preſent you any remedies which doubtleſs will prove importunate.

I could well have beſtowed upon them a more eminent title, then what they have.

Now if ſometimes from your perſon I paſs to others, or if I commend thoſe whom I conceive are deſerving, I aſſure my ſelf, I therein performing an act of Juſtice, and not of ſubjection: you will be no way diſpleaſed with what I do, and well hope, I may conſerve your favours without violating humane Laws, or ſeparating my ſelf from civil ſociety.</p>

                     <p>THough innocency be the felicity of the afflicted, and that I finde in my ſelf the ſatisfaction, he can expect who hath not offended, yet can I not ſo eaſily comfort my ſelf: And the remedies my <hi>Phyloſophy</hi> affoard me, are for meaner misfortunes then the loſs of your favours. All I can contribute to my conſolation out of the aſſurance I have of mine innocency, is the liberty I have taken to tell you ſo, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the injuſtice you have done me, if you have ſo much as ſuffered any to accuſe me. I need not ſeek colours to palliate my actions or words: it is ſufficiently known, their principal objects have ever been the glory of your name, and the deſire to pleaſe you: I beſeech you likewiſe to call to remembrance, that hard times have not hindred me
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:120345:67"/>
from imbarking my ſelf where my inclination called me; and that I have ſerved my Lord your Father, when moſt of his followers were in danger to become his Martyrs. It ſhould ſeem perchance, I ſtand in need of the memory of what is paſt, and that I make my precedent, good Offices appear, to the end to cauſe them to over-way my preſent offences. No (my Lord) I intend not to make uſe of what now is not, for the juſtification of mine actions, nor am I ignorant that never any woman was ſo vicious, who hath not heretofore been a Virgin, nor cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, who cannot preſcribe ſome time preceding his bad life. I ſpeak of to day, as well as of heretofore, and do proteſt unto you, with all the Oaths able to make truth appear holy, and inviolably, that I never had one ſingle temptation againſt my duty, and that my fidelity is ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as (if you ſo pleaſed) it might be without ſuſpicion: I muſt confeſs that you having declared your ſelf no way deſirous to trench upon my liberty, and that you left it wholy to my ſelf, I have ſometimes made uſe thereof, imagining that without wronging that firſt reſolution, I vowed to your ſervice, it might be lawfull for me to have ſecond affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. I will not expect the rack to force me to confeſs it; I have loved a man whom the miſfortunes of Court, and the divers accidents happening in worldly affairs, have ſeparated from ſome friends of yours, and have caſt him into other intereſts then theirs. But beſides, that he was extracted from a Father, who did not more deſire his own good, then your contentment; and ſince I am moſt aſſured how amidſt all the fore-paſſed broils, he at all times conſerved his inclinations for you. I muſt needs tell you, I was in ſuch ſort obliged unto him, as had he declared War againſt my <hi>King,</hi> and againſt my Countrey, I could not have choſen any ſide which had not been unjuſt: I therefore at this day bewail him with warm tears, and if ever I take comfort in the loſs I have ſuſtained, I ſhall eſteem my ſelf the moſt unworthy, and ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full perſon living. Your ſelf (my Lord) knowing (as you do) how much I owe unto his amity, would ſooner adjudge me to die with him, then blame my reſentments. I aſſure my ſelf all my actions are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed unto you, on purpoſe to cauſe you to diſlike them: Howſoever I will not diſpair, but the time to come will right me for what is paſt. You will one day ſee the wrong you offer to my innocency, in admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting falſe witneſſes in prejudice thereof, and what you now term my fault, you will then be pleaſed to ſay; it was my unhappy fate, or my hard fortune: in the interim, I am reſolved to continue in well doing, and though there were no other but my conſcience to acknowledge my fidelitie yet inviolably to remain</p>

                     <p>AS the bearer hereof can teſtifie the obligations I owe you, ſo may he bear witneſs of my perpetual reſentments, and will tell you, that were I born your Son, or ſubject, you could have but the ſame power over me you now poſſeſs: nay, I am perſwaded, I yet owe ſomewhat more to your virtue, then to the right of Nations, or nature. If power hath made Princes, and chance Parents, reaſon well deſerves a further kinde of obedience: It was that which overcame me upon the firſt conference I had with you, cauſing me to proſtrate all my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption at your feet, after having rightly preſented to my thoughts, how impoſſible it is to eſteem my ſelf, and know you: I am ſure this language is no way pleaſing to you, and that you will look awry at my Letter; but do what you pleaſe, I am more a friend to truth, then to your humour, and my ſpirits are ſo repleniſhed with what I have ſeen, and heard, as I can no longer conceal my thoughts: I muſt tell you (Sir) you are the greateſt Tyrant this day living; your authoritie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes awfull to all Souls, and when you ſpeak, there is no further means to retain private opinions, if they be not conformable to yours. I ſpeak this ſeriouſly, and with my beſt ſence; you have often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to ſuch extreamities, that coming from you, without knowing what to anſwer you, I have been ready to exclaim and ſay, (in the rapture wherein I was) Reſtore me my opinion which you have violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forced from me, and take not from me the liberty of conſcience the <hi>King</hi> hath given me. But truely, it is no ſmall pleaſure to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to be happy, and to fall into his hands, who uſeth no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; but to their avail who ſuffer. For my part, I have at all times departed your preſence, fully perſwaded in what I ought to believe: I never gave you a viſite which cured me not of ſome paſſion: I never came into your chamber ſo honeſt a man, as I went forth: How often with one ſhort ſpeech have you elevated me above my ſelf, and bereaved me of whatſoever was fleſhly and prophane in me: How often hearing you diſcourſe of the World to come, and of true felicity have I longed after it, and would willingly have purchaſed it at the price of my life? How often could I have followed you, (would you have conducted me) to a higher pitch of perfection, then all ancient <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ever attained? So it is, that you onely have beſtowed the love of inviſible things upon me, cauſing me to diſtaſte my firſt and moſt violent affections: I ſhould ſtill have been buried in fleſh, had not you drawn me forth, nor had my
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:120345:68"/>
ſpirit been other then a part of my body, had not you taken the pains to unlooſe it from ſenſual objects, and to ſever the eternal from the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhable part. You cauſed me at the firſt encounter to become ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the wicked, and to favour the better ſide, before I was of it; you have made thoſe remedies pleaſing, which all others affrighted me with, and in the midſt of vice, you have conſtrained me to confeſs virtue to be the moſt beautifull thing on earth. Think not therefore, that either the pomp of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, or the glitter of that of <hi>France,</hi> can dazel thoſe eyes of my Soul, whereto you have ſhewed ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things. It is the beams and lightning of thoſe eminent <hi>Virtues</hi> you have diſcovered unto me, which caſt ſo forceable reflections upon the eyes of my Soul, and which cauſe me, (though I formerly reſolved to ſlight all things,) yet at leaſt now to admire ſomething. But yet <hi>(Sir)</hi> aſſure your ſelf, it is not the World I admire, for I rather reflect upon it, as on that which hath deceived me theſe eight and twenty years I have been in it, and wherein I ſcarce ever ſaw any thing, but how to do evil, and counterfeit to be good. In all places on earth, whether my curioſity hath tranſporteth me, beyond Seas, or on the other ſide the <hi>Alpes,</hi> in free States, or in Kingdoms of Conqueſt, I have obſerved among men onely a fare of flatteries, fools, and cheaters; of Old men corrupted by their Anceſtors, and who corrupt their children: Of ſlaves who cannot live out of <hi>Servitude:</hi> of poverty among virtuous perſons, and ambitious covetouſneſs in the Souls of great perſons. But now that you have broken the bars, through which I could onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome light impreſſion of truth, I diſtinctly ſee this general corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and do humbly acknowledge the injury I offered to my Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, when I made Gods of his creatures; and what glorie I ſought to bereave him of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>THere is not any acknowledgement anſwerable to my Obligations unto you: If I owe you any honour, I am farther indepted unto you then my life comes to. Truely, to be ſenſible of another mans ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings ſooner then himſelf, or to aſſume a greater ſhare in his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, then he doth; I muſt confeſs, is as much as not to love in faſhion, or not to live in this age. It is likewiſe a long time ſince I have been acquainted, that the corruption environing you, doth not at all infect you; and how among the wicked, you have conſerved an integrity ſuiting the Raign of <hi>Lewes</hi> the twelfth: Nay, happily we muſt ſearch further, and paſs beyond the Authentick Hiſtorie. It is onely under the Poets <hi>Charlemain,</hi> where a man of your humour is to be found, and that the combat of <hi>Roger</hi> hath been the victorie of <hi>Leon.</hi> Without more particularly explaining my ſelf, you underſtand what I would ſay; and I had much rather be indebted to your ſupport, then to the merit of my cauſe, or to the favourable cenſure I have received from the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick. Certainly, truth it ſelf cannot ſubſiſt, or finde defence without aſſiſtance; yea, even that concerning the Religion; and which more particularly appertaineth to God then the other, ſeaſeth not on our Souls, but by the entermiſe of words; and hath need to be perſwaded to have it believed. You may hereby judge whether the good Offices you affoarded me, were not uſefull unto me, or whether or no my juſt cauſe happened ſuccesfully into your hands. But I muſt defer the thanks due unto you upon this occaſion, till our meeting at <hi>Paris,</hi> to the end, to animate them by my perſonal expreſſion. Be confident in the interim; though pitty it ſelf would ſtay me in my Cell, yet you are of power to cauſe me to infringe my heremetical vow: beſides, you have ſet ſuch a luſter upon that great Citie, and have punctuated unto me ſo many remarkable things, and novelties thereof, in the <hi>Letter</hi> you pleaſed to ſend me, as I ſhould ſhew my ſelf inſenſible of rarities, and not poſſeſſed with an honeſt curioſitie, had I not a deſire to return thither.

                     <p>IT is now fifteen dayes ſince I received any news from you, yet will I believe the change of air hath cured you; and if you (as yet) walk with a ſtaff, it is rather I hope for ſome mark of your authority, then for any ſupport of your infirmity: If this be ſo, I conjure you to make good uſe of this happy ſeaſon yet remaining, and not to loſe theſe fair dayes, haſtning away, and which the next Clouds will carry from us. I give yon this advice, as findeing it good; and becauſe there is not any thing doth more fortifie feeble perſons then the Sun of this moneth, whoſe heat is as innocent as its light. <hi>Adamantus</hi> hath had his ſhare of the unwholeſom influence raigning in theſe parts. The <hi>Feaver</hi> hath not born him the reſpect due to a perſon of his quality, having ſo rudely intreated him, as he is ſcarce to be known: Yet hath he ſome kinde of obligation to his ſickneſs, in having acquainted him with ſuch pleaſures, as were not made for thoſe who are over fortunate, and which formerly he knew nor. At this preſent he can never be weary in praiſing the benefits of Liberty, nor in admiring the beauty of day, and the diverſities of Nature: ſo as to hear him ſpeak you would ſuppoſe all things to be Novelties unto him; and that he is entred into another World, or new born again in this. Beſides, they paſs their time merrily at <hi>N.</hi> and of two hundred calling themſelves <hi>Virgins,</hi> I verily think there is not one who ſpeaks truth, if ſhe have not recovered her Maiden-head. It may be their intention is not ill, and that in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering themſelves to be courted, they have no other deſign, then to raiſe ſervants to God. But ſince Godly intentions do not alwayes produce good effects, if you ſuffer things to run on in the ſame courſe which they do, I greatly apprehend in your regard, that Antichriſt will ſhortly take his beginning in your Dioceſs; and leſt you by conſequence ſhould be the firſt object of his perſecution. I ſuppoſe you-have a greater intereſt then any man, to oppoſe this accident which now threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth us, and that to divert a miſchief which is to be followed by the Worlds ruin, you ought not to ſpare the fulminations of <hi>Rome;</hi> nor make uſe onely of half your power. There are not any will be averſe to this good work, ſave onely our young Gallants.

But it were likewiſe ſmall <hi>Juſtice,</hi> your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſhould make this Citie a Village, and that <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould uſurp all the affections you owe me. As I perfectly love you, ſo do I expect to be reciprocally reſpected by you; nor would you I ſhould herein have any advantage over you, though I yield unto you in all other things: Neither of us therefore can enjoy ſolide contentments, ſo long as we are ſeparated; and I pretend you do me wrong, if you take ſatisfaction where I am not. Take Poſt therefore with ſpeed, to be here quickly, grow not old either by the way, or at your Inne, for by this means I ſhall get the advantage of that time, and you ſhall gain me four dayes out of the loſs of three Moneths.

                     <p>I Do here at the firſt tell you, I have no other opinion of you, then your ſelf gives me, and I have at all times had a more ſtrong and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:120345:70"/>
ſound notion of the inward qualities by the ſpeech, then by the <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogmony.</hi> But if after the <hi>Letter</hi> you did me the honour to write unto me, it were neceſſary to ſeek any forraign proofs; the teſtimonie of thoſe two great perſonages, who have admired your virtue even in the bud, and left the pourtrait thereof under their own hands, may well ſerve as an Antidote, to ſecure me from the impreſſions and the painted ſhadows of calumny. I who know that <hi>Aſia, Africk,</hi> and a great part of the World beſides, believe Fables as fundamental points of <hi>Religion,</hi> do not at all wonder (if in what concerneth your particular) there be ſome who ſide not with the truth, which is ſure to finde enemies in all places where there are men. This is an effect of that errour, now grown old in popular opinion; that it is fit an honeſt woman be ignorant of many things, and that, to maintain her reputation, it is not requiſite all the World commend her; but that ſhe be unknown to all men. Nay, I ſay further: The vulgar doth ordinarily caſt an injurious eye, and with ſome tax of extravagancie, upon great and Heroical qualities, if they appear in that ſex, to which they conceive it ought not to appertain. Now though to ſpeak generally, and to reflect rightly upon the order of earthly things, and the grounds of policie, I muſt confeſs, I ſhould lean to the firſt of theſe opinions: Yet will I be well adviſed, how I think that Nature hath not ſo much liberty left her, as to paſs (upon occaſion) the limits ſhe ordinarily alloweth her ſelf; or ſometimes to exceed her bounds without blame, to the end, to produce certain things, far ſurpaſſing the reſt in perfection. It is no good Argument to averre, that becauſe you are adorned with the virtues of our ſex, you therefore have not reſerved thoſe of your own; or that it is a ſin for a woman to underſtand the Language which heretofore the Veſtals made uſe of. I will therefore leave theſe calumnious perſons, who deſire to bereave Lillies of their beauty, and Chriſtal of its clearneſs, to return to the <hi>Letter</hi> I have received from you; where without flattery I will affirm, that <note n="*" place="margin">Meaning himſelf.</note> this man who hath been deſcribed unto you, for ſo vain-glorious a perſon; who deſpiſeth times paſt, who mocketh the modern, and prejudicateth the future; hath found out divers things in your works well pleaſing unto him: ſo as if my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation be at this preſent of any weight with you, you may for your own advantage, add this <hi>Encomion</hi> to that of <hi>Lipſius</hi> and <hi>Montagnio,</hi> and boldly affirm you have this advantage over <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperours,</hi> that the taſtes of two different ages have agreed in your favour. Since you were firſt commended, the face of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> hath changed ten times: Neither our manner, attire, or Court, are cogniſible to what you have ſeen them. Men have made new Laws, yea, and the virtues of our fore-fathers age, are eſteemed the vices of ours: yet ſhall it appear, how amidſt ſo many changes and ſtrange revolutions, you have brought even
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:120345:71"/>
to our times one and the ſame reputation; and that your beauty (I ſpeak of what enamoreth the <hi>Capucins</hi> Friers, and old Philoſophers) hath not left you, with your youth. I ſhall in mine own regard be very glad, the World ſhould take notice how much I honour virtue, by what name ſoever it paſſeth, and under what ſhape ſoever it is ſhrowded: and I eſteem my party ſtronger by the half, then it hath been, ſince you have vouchſafed to enter thereinto. But if without offending againſt Grammatical rules, and thoſe of <hi>Decorum:</hi> I durſt take you for my ſecond, I aſſure my ſelf if we were to denounce war againſt theſe petty Authours, who are ingendered by errour, and diſcloſed out of the corruption of this age, you ſhould not have over many in talking half a dozen of them to taſk for your part. As the leaſt, you would put thoſe Pedants to ſilence, who brag they have taught me to ſpeak. Yet will I tell you, before I proceed any further, and to the end they may know as much (if you pleaſe) that my Mother is not reſolved to give this for granted, and how if there be any glorie to be gotten in ſo poor an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit, ſhe is determined to diſpute the matter againſt all theſe book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers. I have ever been hitherto of opinion, that in what concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the choice of words, I ought to ſuffer my ſelf to be governed by the common acceptation thereof, without adhering to any one mans ſingle example; and that inſtead of acknowledging the authority of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, I am to follow the publick conſent. But howſoever, it is not the praiſe of a great Orator to ſpeak our language well, but rather the mark of a true <hi>Frenchman;</hi> Nor do I pretend applauſe from any, for not being born in <hi>Holland,</hi> or <hi>Germany.</hi> It is true, I attribute much to Elocution, and know that high things ſtand in need of the help of words, and that after thoſe have been rightly conceived, they are as happily to be expreſſed. It onely angers me, that out of the pooreſt part of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> received among the ancients, they will needs extract all ours. And that to pleaſe mean ſpirits, it is fitting (as they think) our works ſhould reſemble thoſe ſacrifices, whereout they take the heart, and where, of all the head, nothing is left ſave onely the tongue. I would make anſwer to the other advertiſements you did me the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to give me, if they had not relation to a matter I reſerve my ſelf fully to treat in <hi>L.</hi> being a work I am in hand with, and which I hope ſhortly to preſent unto you at <hi>Paris.</hi> There it ſhall be, where I will make it appear unto you, that reaſon cannot have an eaſier taſk, then to perſwade a ſpirit of the like making mine is, and that I equally love the truth, whether I receive it from any other, or that I finde it my ſelf.</p>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:120345:72"/>
truths frame incredible fixions; howſoeuer, if you loved me not, but according to the rigour or Law and Reaſon, I ſhould much fear to be but of indifferent eſteem with you. It is then much better for me, the affection you bear me, appear rather a paſſion then a virtue. Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities in all other things are reproveable, in this laudable; and as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rivers are never ſo uſefull as when they overflow: ſo hath Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip nothing more excellent in it then exceſs; and doth rather offend in her moderation, then in her violence. Continue therefore in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving neither rule, nor meaſure, in the favours you afford me, and to the end I may be lawfully ingratefull, being infinitely obliged, leave me not ſo much as words wherewith to thank you. Truely your laſt <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> have taken from me all the terms I ſhould imploy in this occaſion, and inſtead of the good Offices I inceſſantly receive from you, it ſeems you will onely have new importunies in payment. Since it is thus, fear not my niceneſs, or that in matters of great conſequence, I make not uſe of your affection, and in ſlight ones I abuſe it not; henceforward it is requiſite, you recover all my Law-ſutes, compoſe all my quarrels, and correct all my errours: For to undertake to cure all my diſeaſes, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you would not, in prejudice of <hi>Mounſieur de Lorime.</hi> It ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuffice, you will be pleaſed to let him at this paſſage read how I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire my life at his hands; and if the onely obeying him, will preſerve me, I will place his precepts immediately after Gods Commandments. There is no receit diſtaſtefull, if his Eloquence affoard the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, nor pain unaſſwaged by his words, before it be expelled by his Art: Remoteſt cauſes are as viſible to him, as the moſt ordinarie effects; and if nature ſhould diſcover herlſelf naked unto him, he could not thereby receive any further communication of her ſecrets, then he hath acquired by former experience. Let him therefore beſtow better nights on me, then thoſe I have had theſe ſix years, wherein I have had no ſleep; intreat him to make a peace between my <hi>Liver</hi> and <hi>Stomack,</hi> and to compoſe this civil War, which diſturbs the whole inſide of my body, if he deſire I ſhould no longer live, but for his glorie; and to perſwade the World, he is nothing indebted to thoſe <hi>Arabian</hi> Princes, who practiſed <hi>Phiſick,</hi> or to the gods themſelves who invented it. Truely if meer Humaniſts, whom divers of his profeſſion have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſcorned, ſeem of ſlight conſideration with him; or if he be not contented with a civil acknowledgement, I am ready to call him my preſerver, and to erect Altars, and offer ſacrifice unto him: Yea, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs this, I will quit the better part of what I implore; It ſhall ſuffice he hinder me from dying, and that he cauſe my diſeaſes and plaints to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſome three-ſcore years. I would likewiſe know (if you pleaſe) what his good Cozen doth, that Cittizen of all Common-wealths, that man who is no more a ſtranger in <hi>Perſia,</hi> then in <hi>France,</hi> and whoſe
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:120345:73"/>
knowledge hath the ſame extent, as hath all the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, and all the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy. I have at the leaſt three hundred queſtions to aſk him, and a whole Volumne of doubts to propoſe unto him; I expect at our firſt meeting, to reſolve hith him upon the affairs of former ages, and concerning the different opinions of <hi>Baromus</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebrard</hi> on the one ſide, and of <hi>Eſcales</hi> and <hi>Caſaubon</hi> on the other. I am in the mean time reſolved to paſs ten or twelve dayes with <hi>Mounſieur de Racan,</hi> to the end to ſee him in that time work miracles, and write things which God muſt neceſſarily reveal unto him. Truely Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours have no greater advantage over Maſters of Fence, then he hath over Doctors; and he is at this day one of the great workmanſhips of Nature. If all wits were like his, there would be a great deal of time loſt at School: Univerſities would become the moſt unprofitable parts of the Common-wealth, and <hi>Latine</hi> as well as <hi>Millan</hi> Parchment, with other forraign Merchandizes, would be rather marks of our vanity, then any effects of our neceſſity.</p>

At our return from Court, we are to come to your delicate Houſe, and to ſee the places where the Muſes have appeared unto you, and dictated the Verſes we have ſo much admired.

                     <p>SInce you deſire to ſee in what <hi>Stile</hi> I begun to write; and how ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient a fellow I was at nineteen: I here ſend you my errours of that age, and the firſt faults I committed: it were much better to condemn their memory, then to fall into them afreſh, by renewing them in this place. But you will be abſolutely obeyed, and I have no reſiſtance againſt your force: See here then the remainder of many things now loſt, and what I have ſaved from ſhip wrack, being neither valuable to the Diamonds, or lumps of Ambergreece, the Sea hath lately caſt upon the Coaſt of <hi>Bayone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I adviſe you for your honours ſake, not to refreſh the memory of what is paſt, nor to ſeek for examples of your fidelity in our Civil wars, ſince you have not therein conſerved it.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:120345:74"/>
to what they are; yet am I well aſſured, you were engaged in a faction, wherein you have not been uſefull to the <hi>King,</hi> no, not where you could ſerve him as an honeſt man ought; ſo as if you deſire I ſhould (to do you a favour) forget things paſt; or if you will alleadge that the tranquillity we now enjoy, and the good order uſed in mannaging Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick affairs, were the effects of your prudent conduct; beſides, that this glorie is not abſolutely due unto you, and there remaining others who ſuppoſe they have as large a ſhare therein as your ſelf. You muſt not take it ill, if I freely tell you, there is not any thing therein wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of admiration. You entered upon the State-government in a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time, you therein found all things ſo well diſpoſed, as they ſeemed of themſelves to work the wiſhed effects; and the moſt of the <hi>French</hi> ſo inclined to ſubjection, as it was no hard matter to bring them to due obedience. And herein you are neceſſarily to confeſs, you owe much to <hi>C C C,</hi> and that he paſſed the laſt years of his life for your inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as he ſince then died for the general good of this Kingdom. If there hath been any obſtacle to remove, which at this preſent may be troubleſome unto you, he hath before his death rid his hands thereof, with as much good fortune as reſolution. If it may be eſteemed a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, to underſtand the nature of the people, thereby to deal with them according to their humours, he hath made it appear unto you, there was not any thing above his patience; ſince without reſentment, he was able to ſuffer the loſs of his liberty; and if ſo it were, that he was forced to make uſe of ſome violent act, which nevertheleſs was neceſſary; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hatred, nor envy have ever been of power to hinder his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings. In a word, he hath tamed the moſt ſtubborn ſpirits, he hath left the parties who moſt perplexed this poor Kingdom, either abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ruined, or ſo weakned, as they are utterly unable to riſe again. He hath accuſtomed all men to patience, and hath performed ſo ſtrange things, as we now finde not any thing extraordinary; and (what I moſt eſteem) he hath made the World ſee how great things the <hi>Kings</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was able to do, though ſometimes he did this for the eſtabliſhing his own. I therefore do not at all now wonder, if having found affairs diſpoſed to receive ſuch impreſſions as you pleaſed to put upon them, you have hitherto cauſed them to fall out indifferently well, or if you have not as yet committed any conſiderable errours in the mannaging of State-affairs, as not having any matter of difficulty to overcome, you have onely herein ſuffered your ſelf to be guided by common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary preſidents. But what is all this? that your indeavours ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be preferred before all thoſe ſervices the <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>P.</hi> with their Predeceſſors have performed. Had you any imagination, when you ſpake in ſo high terms, you could cauſe us to believe ſo great impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities; or had you ſo poor an opinion of all mens judgements, as
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:120345:74"/>
to ſuppoſe we more valued your fears and continual diſtruſts, then ſo many generous actions performed by them in the eye of all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for the glorie and reputation of this Crown. I will not touch upon the merits of the living, leſt you ſhould impute that to a deſire of complacency, or ſome particular obligation, which the onely intereſt of truth exacteth of me. I onely require juſtice for the dead, whom you have dared to wrong in the <hi>Kings</hi> preſence, againſt all rules of piety, obliging you to reſpect their memory. Doubt not, but that they are yet ſenſible of things in this World, and that amidſt the glorie and contentments they poſſeſs, their care to live in the good odour of men, doth yet continue: You may therefore well imagine, they have juſt cauſe to think, thoſe lives they have loſt in their Princes ſervice, and for the defence of their Countrey had been ill imployed, and might juſtly complain of our ingratitude, ſhould we ſuffer before our eyes their reputations to be queſtioned, without teſtifying any diſtaſte. In vain had they triumphed over the moſt beautifull parts of the earth, and carried their victorious Arms where the name of <hi>France</hi> was not yet arrived. To ſmall purpoſe had they recluded the power of ſtrangers, wherein the limits of <hi>Nature</hi> preſcribed unto them. In vain likewiſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in our memorie had they conſerved <hi>State</hi> &amp; <hi>Religion,</hi> when thoſe of your faction did diverſly labour the ruine of both; ſhould you now be ſuffered to enter into compariſon with them; or as though the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that glorie wherein they alwayes remained, were unjuſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted in their caſe. But the miſchief herein is, that we have onely right on our ſide, and that all things are ſo averſe unto us, as it will be very hard to cauſe reaſon to be ſo much as regarded, becauſe it favours us; ſo as I get nothing by diſputing with a man who is above <hi>Laws,</hi> and in whoſe behalf the <hi>King</hi> hath received ſo advantagious impreſſions, as he may ſecurely exerciſe his paſſions, under pretext of his <hi>Authority,</hi> and confound his particular enmities, together with the intereſts of the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> I ſhould be very loath to ſay you are grown to ſuch extremities, or that out of vanity and preſumption, two imperfections purely humane, you ſhould ſo ſuddenly be ſtept into <hi>Cruelty</hi> &amp; <hi>Tyrannie,</hi> two Diabolical <hi>Errours.</hi> Nevertheleſs, if having great power in the <hi>Kings</hi> breaſt, (as indeed you may do much) you cauſe a general diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence therein of all things, and indeavour to bring his beſt ſervants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuſpition with him, thereby to make them unuſefull: If you intend by imaginarie <hi>jealouſies</hi> to divert his inclination from that goodneſs, whereto at all times it hath had an extraordinary propention; or if you hinder him from the free uſe of his natural <hi>debonarity</hi> toward her, who brought him into this World. Do you not think men will begin to ſay, it is not vanity alone hath ſpoiled you? and that it will not be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally wiſhed, that the <hi>Maxims</hi> you make uſe of, were ſomewhat more
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:120345:75"/>
                        <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and leſs contrary to <hi>Gods Commandments.</hi> I know we have a <hi>Prince</hi> of ſuch perfection, as <hi>Heaven</hi> it ſelf cannot without miracle make farther addition, then <hi>Experience.</hi> So timely a wiſe man hath ſcarce ever been; all his inclinations do wholy aim at good, and <hi>Virtue</hi> is to him ſo natural, as I verily believe he would be much troubled to do ill. But you are not ignorant that one cannot give poiſon to any man ſo eaſily, as to him whom in taking it, ſuppoſeth he receiveth wholeſom Phiſick, and that ill counſels have never ſo great power over our ſpirits, as when we embrace them without diſtruſt. Surely the uttermoſt of evils is that, whereof we have neither knowledge nor apprehenſion; nor is there any fault more dangerous, then when we make uſe of reaſon it ſelf in our er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. I have no purpoſe to offend any with my diſcourſe, and do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to believe, I think it very well you make uſe of all the means, you ſuppoſe, may conduce to the cauſing the <hi>Kings</hi> authority to become more awfull to all men, and publick peace further confirmed. Theſe are two ſo delicate matters, as they cannot be touched without danger, not conſerved with over much care. Yet muſt you pardon me, if I ſay you are to be very circumſpect, leſt in thinking to ſtrengthen this authority, you abuſe it not to the prejudice of your own conſcience; and you are withall to conſider, that <hi>Peace</hi> cannot be of any long continuance, if it be pleaſing to God, who hath never ſuffered without reſentment, that the Laws of Nature ſhould be violated. Theſe Laws the <hi>Barbarians</hi> themſelves allow of, have not been eſtabliſhed either by force or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, as others are: The firſt thing we can do, is to follow them, and the obedience we yield them, can neither be milder, nor more eaſie: They are not engraven upon Marble, but are born with us; they are not pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to one people or Countrey, but are common to all men: They have not ordained any puniſhment for thoſe who will not obſerve them, ſo was it not probable, that any could be found ſo much their own ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as to be inclined to ſuch extreamities. To conclude, they were not made for the mean and vulgar people onely, but for all the World: and thoſe are the more ſtrictly thereto obliged, who owe moſt to their extraction. If this be true (as you cannot but know) ſhould not Heaven be injured? things both <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Moral,</hi> ſhould they not be openly diſpiſed, would not Nature her ſelf cry vengeance againſt you, ſhould you by your crafts and diſguiſements animate a young Prince againſt that perſon, who of all the World, ought to be moſt dear unto him, and deface out of his royal Soul by your ſervile fears (ill founded) his firſt and moſt innocent affections? I will not believe for mine own content, and the honour of our age, that this miſchief can happen; but I am much perplexed to know who it is, that cauſeth all honeſt men to ſigh, who hindreth us the perfect feeling of that felity <hi>peace</hi> affoards, and which compaſſionateth even ſtrangers, who are leaſt intereſſed in our affairs.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:120345:75"/>
Will you have ſo ſavage a Soul, as to dread the faireſt thing the World affoardeth? or can you be ſo puſillanimous, as to have any timorous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon an afflicted perſon? Can you imagine goodneſs it ſelf ſhould do hurt, or that the Court cannot without danger behold what it hath heretofore ſeen with ſo great contentment? For my part, if this be thus, I finde no difference between a loſt ſtate, and one concerning it ſelf in this ſort; and it muſt needs be, thoſe miſeries you apprehend are very violent, if they exceed your remedies. Alas, if we have forgotten we are Chriſtians, ſhall we not at leaſt remember we are men? if we be almoſt inſenſible, even to brutality, ſhall we not yet affoard ſomething to apparance? Be ſatisfied in being in eſtimation and favour with the <hi>King:</hi> Govern alone, (if you can) all his affairs; adminiſter <hi>Juſtice</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any aſſiſtant; take all his authority into your own hands; yet ſuffer his <hi>Mother</hi> to ſee him, give way that he refuſe her not a favour, which he cannot hinder, even his very enemies, ſometimes from enjoying. Affoard, ſince it is in your power, this favour to all <hi>France;</hi> appeaſe in time thoſe publick complaints ready to riſe againſt you, and ſlackning ſome part of your rigorous counſels, add this onely point deficient in the felicity of this <hi>Kings</hi> raign. If you can procure ſo pious a thing, and ſo pleaſing to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man;</hi> this great reputation of <hi>Honeſty</hi> you have ſhrewdly hazarded, will return with more glitter, and luſter then ever it had; we will not believe our own eyes, if they ſhew us any thing oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite thereunto: We will ſuppoſe it is ſome other who had a deſire to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip the <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>P.</hi> and how there is not any apparance, that a man in whom age ought to finiſh, what the ſtudy of <hi>Wiſedom</hi> had happily left unperfect, ſhould ſtill be ſubject to enter into errours. But if on the other ſide, you go on in abuſing our good <hi>Kings</hi> facility, &amp; unprofitably to perplex his ſpirits with perpetual diſtruſts, if you diſguiſe all things unto him, on purpoſe to cauſe him to perceive nothing, but what you pleaſe, nor to take notice of ill, being hidden under the apparance of its contrary; perſwade not your ſelf, that <hi>God</hi> will long ſuffer <hi>Truth</hi> to be unknown. Do not think, but things will ſhortly return to the ſame terms wherein <hi>Nature</hi> placed them; or that the <hi>King</hi> having once diſcovered the bad deſigns of his Favourites, will not eaſily be induced once again to amaze the whole World, by a ſecond example of his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and to ſatisfie his peoples complaints, by abandoning them to publick venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Then will you over-late reflect upon this Worlds vanity: you will then conſider, that when we eſteemed you happy, you were mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a place from whence there is not any who have not fallen, and how <hi>Fortune</hi> envious of your felicity, drew you from that ſweet and peaceable life, wherein you were entred; fearing leſt thereby you might conſerve your <hi>Virtue,</hi> or therein avoid your ruin.</p>

                     <p>AFter I have told you how dear the teſtimonies I have received from your remembrance are unto me; I can do no leſs then thank you for the good <hi>Juſtice</hi> you affoarded me. If the like <hi>Integrity</hi> were to be found among thoſe, who have the life and fortunes of men in their hands, I ſhould take pleaſure in pleading, and by the ſame reaſon Laws puniſh offenders, I might hope to be rewarded. It may be I flatter my ſelf, but I ſuppoſe my intereſt is the ſame with all honeſt men, and that they can no longer live in ſecurity, ſince I am fallen upon, for the virtues I value in them. Surely, if the World ſuffer ill tongues to touch upon my labours, it is very probable, they will not ſpare other mens; and that hereafter there will not be any thing ſo excellent, which ſhall not be hated, nor ſo holy, ſome <hi>Lyſander</hi> will not violate. Theſe ill examples therefore are not to be ſuffered, nor is it to be tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated, that one particular perſon forſake publick belief, to rely upon his own peculiar ſence: and ſhould this diſorder continue, Artificers and Farmers would (at length) prove reformers of State. I pretend not hereby to leſſen the favour I received from you: But on the contrary, I am ſo eaſie to oblige, as I ſuppoſe my friends give me all whatſoever they take not from me; you will yet avouch thus much, that ſupporting my ſide, you do in ſome ſort fight in your own defence: For if to day they ſay, my Stile is not good, to morrow they will maintain your Rimes to be naught. But it is now time, after I have thanked you, that I wrangle with you, and complain for having been injured in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Mounſieur de Racan,</hi> whom you tax for a diſeaſe, whereof I have been dead this ten years. I doubt not, but that part of us whereby we are men, as well as by reaſon, hath heretofore acquired you Honour; and that our Hiſtorie ought to yield a glorious teſtimonie of your fore-paſſed virtues in that kinde: But ſince you can no longer be happy therein, but by memorie; and that your courage will now ſtand in need of your Sons aſſiſtance; me thinks, it is unſeemly for you to ſcoffe at our weakneſs; for howſoever in accuſing us, for not having conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued young ſo long as your ſelf, you can onely tax us for arriving at the Haven ſooner then you have done. There is none but <hi>M. F.</hi> who may boldly laugh at the debility of others, and make jeſts at our charge; but he hath reaſon ſo to do, ſince his merit herein is generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; as being little leſs valiant in thoſe feats, then that ancient <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes,</hi> who ſubdued Monſters, and in one night was fifty times Son in Law to one of his Hoſts. I infinitely eſteem the eminent qualities
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:120345:76"/>
wherewith he is adorned, and finde nothing in him which is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly pleaſing. But when I conſider that he is capeable to cauſe us to be deſpiſed by a whole Sex, and to make us ridiculous to the moſt beautifull part of the World, I have great conteſtation within my ſelf, to forbear to wiſh him ill; and what part ſoever I take, touching the glorie all men allow him: Yet doth it not a little anger me, that my Eloquence is not ſo maſculine as his.</p>

                     <p>WEre it not for the <hi>Letter</hi> you wrote me, I ſhould have ſtood in need of all my Phyloſophy to comfort my ſelf for the loſs I have received. But ſince you have ſent me the counterfeit of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine company I left at <hi>Paris,</hi> having thereby ſomething, repreſenting my forepaſſed good fortune; take it not ill, I begin to have leſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion then formerly I had, of the diſcomfort I ſuffer in being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from you; or if I ſay, you have cauſed your abſence to become thereby the leſs irkſome unto me, which otherwiſe would have proved inſupportable. <hi>Lucidor</hi> doth overmuch oblige me in retaining me in his memorie, and in deſiring my company in his inchanted <hi>Pallace.</hi> I beſeech you to tell him, I ſhall never forget the happy day we there ſpent, and that I cannot believe, there is a more excellent Structure even in the <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdom, though builded by the very hands of <hi>Taſso</hi> or <hi>Arioſto:</hi> in ſadneſs my thoughts ſtayed there, when I parted thence, I ſtill walk in his Allies; I wander in his Woods, and ſlumber upon the banks of the Fairies Fountain, whereof I need onely drink a drop to turn Poet: That infinity of different beauties diſcovering themſelves to our eyes, at the opening of the Gates, cauſed me inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hate <hi>Rome, Paris,</hi> and all Cities; and I termed the Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> miſerable, in that he is condemned never to remove from the place where he is, and conſequently never to ſee what I there beheld. The Foot-poſt, who is to carry this Letter, doth much preſs my diſpatch, telling me, he ſhall hazard, to remain ſtill in this place, if I make it any longer. This is equally my miſerie, and your good fortune; for as I am conſtrained to deprive my ſelf of the contentment to entertain time with you, ſo will this free you from divers impertinent ſpeeches, wherewith happily I ſhould otherwiſe have importuned you.</p>

                     <p>I Can no longer live without receiving news from you, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding from your ſelf, the good ſucceſs of your voyage. My bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writ unto me, they have done you ſome kinde of juſtice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you were reaſonable well pleaſed; but if this content be not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, I am reſolved not to rejoyce, and I do already condemne the State, and all thoſe who govern it. It is a ſhame to ſee the bounties of Princes in the hands of ſuch perſons who can neither be uſefull nor pleaſing unto them; and that honeſt men muſt ſtill ſatisfie themſelves with the onely teſtimony of a good conſcience, and in the content they receive in well-doing: For my part, I will not complain of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, provided, you occaſion to commend her. Now if the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State underſtood my ſecret, and that for ſatisfying of two, it were onely neceſſary to oblige one; by acquitting themſelves of what they owe you, they might eaſily ſpare what they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed me. We have newly received tidings of the Defeat given to the Enemies naval Army; but having loſt one of my near friends in that Conflict, I cannot forbear to be a bad <hi>French-man</hi> till to morrow, and to grieve for the Victory, whereat all others rejoyce: Beſides, I being of a profeſſion onely exerciſed in private, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I aſſure you the report of Cannons begins to trouble me; for of all Wars, thoſe of <hi>Germany</hi> pleaſe me beſt, in that I am thirty dayes journeys off: Our Doctors ſay no leſs then I do: the moſt zealous among them, longingly expect a more quiet ſeaſon, fearing the ruine of the adverſe part, for the intereſt of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Schollerſhip: and in very truth, I cannot conceive what they ſhould do with their controverſies, where there no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger any againſt whom thay could contend. I write you this from the bank of the moſt beautifull River of the World; but being ſo far from you, I taſte all pleaſures imperfectly; and were my Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man revived, not ſeeing you, there would ſtill remain a kinde of affliction upon me, which nothing but your preſence is able to eaſe. Without playing the Poet, I can aſſure you, I have taught your name to all the Rocks in my wilderneſs: and it is written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Barks of all our Trees: but you are no way obliged unto me, in that I love you extraordinarily. It is an action indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on my will or free election, it being at this preſent as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for me, as all other things are, without which I cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt: And it is requiſite I ſuffer my ſelf to be tranſported by the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:120345:77"/>
force of my inclination, which another would call his <hi>Deſtiny.</hi> Be therefore when you pleaſe mine enemy; you are aſſured I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be but.</p>

                     <p>A Lame Foot-man would have made more haſte then the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger did, who delivered me your two <hi>Letters,</hi> fifteen dayes after the latter of them was written: Yet notwithſtanding was he very well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com, and had it been <hi>Lyſander</hi> himſelf, bringing news from you, he had been inviolable to all my Lackies; and I had received him as my friend. Truely, there is not any diſcontent which is not loſt, in the joy I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be beloved by you, and if the ſmall diſpleaſure they have done me, were of power to offend me, I ſhould in your favours finde the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy others ſeek for revenge. I have as unmovedly read the <hi>Satyre</hi> made againſt me, as I write this <hi>Letter;</hi> and have onely accuſed my bad fortune, which hath at all times choſen the moſt infamous of all men for mine enemies: you cannot imagine how much I am aſhamed of this unlucky accident, and of the wrong I ſuppoſe I receive, when at any time they give me the advantage in a compariſon wherein <hi>Lyſander</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter without having the better of it. Yet <hi>Sir,</hi> I am reſolved to have patience, provided, the War you raiſe againſt me, be onely feigned, and that you ſpeak not ſeriouſly; for ſurely I would burn all my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, were they culpable of one ſingle word diſpleaſing unto you; and my thoughts ſhould be far different from my intention, had I done any thing diſguſtfull unto you; howſoever, I crave pardon for the fault whereof you accuſe me, though I ſuppoſe I have not done you any ſo ill Offices to fair Ladies, as it ſeems you would perſwade me: On the contrary, if my teſtimony be ſeconded by their aſcents, there will not be hereafter any among them, who will not look upon you, as at one of their chiefeſt felicities; and who will not ſell all her Pearls, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe one of your Nights. Queens will come from the remoteſt parts of the World, to taſte the pleaſure of your converſation; and you ſhall be the third after <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> who ſhall cauſe them to come at the report of your Virtue. As for devout perſons, I do not think they will rank <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> in the number of <hi>Vices;</hi> for by that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:120345:78"/>
reaſon they ſhould hold all thoſe for <hi>Saints,</hi> whom the Courts of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> have declared as impotent, and ſo fill <hi>Heaven</hi> with ſick folks. To ſay truth, I cannot deny, but I have given the <hi>Alarum</hi> to married men, and I muſt ſay, your viſits will be ſuſpicious to thoſe who know you not: but when they ſhall underſtand what I intend to publiſh in all places, that you had rather die, then violate with ſo much as one ſingle thought, the laws of true <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> and that your fidelity is irreproveable: In ſtead of avoiding you, as an object of ſcandal, they will propound you to their Wives as an example of <hi>Continency.</hi> I could alleadge divers other things for my <hi>Juſtification,</hi> but if you think I have been faulty, I will not preſume to imagine I am innocent; and rather then contradict you, I will ſign the decree of my <hi>Death</hi> with mine own hand.</p>

                     <p>THere is no other means to exceed the height of what you have written, not to anſwer the civilities of your <hi>Letter,</hi> but onely by rendring you all your own words: I know not your meaning: but to take the moſt unprofitable of your friends for your benefactor, and to thank me for the ill I do you, is no leſs then ſtrangely to abuſe the propriety of words, eſpecially for a man ſo perfectly acquainted with our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as your ſelf; or queſtionleſs it muſt needs be, you ſuffer my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions with the like patience, as good men receive thoſe afflictions God layes upon them. For as loſſes and diſeaſes are preſents and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in terms of devotion; ſo do you beſtow pompous names upon poor matters, &amp; you make your ſelf believe, you ſhall draw ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage out of my Amity, though in truth you extract nothing thence but charge; nor doth it produce any better effects, then Thorns: And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter, what elſe are the pains and affairs, I perpetually put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you? or what difference is there between the hatred of an Enemy, and ſo troublelom an affection as mine? It is I who diſturb your reſt, who uſurp your liberty, who will not ſuffer you to have any leaſure, though that be the true poſſeſſion of the wiſe. It is no want of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will in me, that I change not all your kindeneſs into choller, and make not a pleader and wrangler of the beſt tempered ſpirit Philoſophy ever received from Nature; I lay Ambuſhes for you at <hi>Paris,</hi> at <hi>Fontain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau,</hi> and at S. <hi>Germains:</hi> Yea, ſhould you think to hide your ſelf at the Worlds end to avoid importunities, I would undertake the voyage of <hi>Magellan,</hi> to ſeek you out there: yet are you well pleaſed with all
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:120345:78"/>
this, and I receive thanks inſtead of expecting ill words. The care you have to oblige me, exceeds all I can deſire: Good Offices come thick upon me, when they proceed from your ſide; and they are acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it ſeems you are pleaſed to convert into habitudes. Without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into infinities, do I not of recent memorie owe to your teſtimonie, all the good opinion your excellent friend can have of me; and if he imagine I am worthy any eſtimation, is it not you who ſets a value upon my defects, and who have aſſiſted me in deceiving him? But in what ſort ſoever you have procured me theſe favours, be it that therein you have either committed theft, or made an acquiſition, I am ſtill right happie to be beloved by a man, who hath the reputation not to affect ill things, and to pleaſe whom, it is as much as to be reckoned in the number of honeſt men. The day before I parted from Court, I had the leaſure to obſerve him at <hi>Mounſieur</hi> the Marſhal of <hi>Schambergs</hi> houſe; but I aſſure you, I could ſpy nothing of ſlender conſideration, either in his words or aſpect; and though I have alwayes uſed to be diffident of my firſt opinion; nor ever to judge without long deliberation, I have notwithſtanding herein, ſinned againſt my own rules; and was not aſhamed to ſay, that a wit of twenty years had amazed mine: But the Sermon bell rings, which calls and forceably draws me from you: my contentment therefore muſt give place to my dutie, which commands me to make an end, after I have required news from you, concerning a Woman, to whom I am extraordinarily and particularly obliged; of a Woman I ſay, who is more worth then all our books, and in whoſe converſation there is ſufficient to make one an honeſt man, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the help of <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Romans:</hi> How old a Courtier ſoever you are, you underſtand not <hi>French,</hi> if you underſtand not <hi>Madame de Deftoges.</hi>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:120345:79"/>
caſt incenſe upon a dead body, and to ſtrow flowers upon his grave, but this is no reviving of him. I no longer receive any comfort in the news you ſend me, and I am well aſſured my misfortune is conſtant, what alteration ſoever happen in the World: it remaineth then, that I ſeek for my conſolation in your preſence, and power forth all my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints into your boſom; this I will do at the firſt ſight of the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams, beſeeching you to believe, that as in the middeſt of felicity, I ſhould have need of you to make me happy; ſo alſo having ſuch a friend as your ſelf, I ſhall never eſteem my ſelf abſolutely miſerable.</p>

                     <p>I Do far more eſteem the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> ſilence, then the <hi>Eloquence</hi> of ſuch Writers, and am perſwaded, (excepting in Church ſervice, and for the neceſſity of Commerce) the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> ſhould do well to forbid them <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>French;</hi> whereof they ſeek to make two barbarous languages. I know well, that <hi>French</hi> ſpirits are ſworn Enemies to all ſorts of bondage, and that twelve hundred years of Monarchy, hath not been of power to make them loſe their liberty, it being as natural to them as life it ſelf. Whatſoever ugly face they frame to the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and how full of Tygers and Serpents ſoever they paint the ſame, yet do I finde it right neceſſary in this Kingdom: For beſides that, it would cauſe (as in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi>) even the wicked in ſome ſort, to reſemble the upright, and vice not at all to offend the publick eye: it would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides hinder Fools from filling the world with their baſtardly books, and the faults of School maſters from being as frequent as thoſe are of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and Generals of Armies. Truely it is a ſhame there are Laws againſt thoſe who counterfeit Coins and falſifie Mercandizes; yet that ſuch are freely permitted who corrupt Philoſophy and Eloquence, and who violate thoſe things, the Vulgar ought no more to meddle with then with State government, or Religious Myſteries. The late great plague was of ſmall conſideration in compariſon of this, which checks all the World: and ſurely, if ſpeedy order be not taken, the multiplicity of our Authors will make a Library as big as <hi>Paris,</hi> wherein there ſhall ſcarcely be found one good word, or reaſonable conceit. Theſe be the fruits ariſing out of inordinate idleneſs, and the third ſcourge cauſed by Peace, ſent to afflict this poor Realm after Duels, and Law-ſuits. There are hardly any to be found, who are contented to keep their faults and follies to themſelves, or to ſin in ſecret; but are alſo doting upon their
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:120345:79"/>
own follies, as they do deſire to engrave them in Marble and Braſs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to eternize their memory, and to make them paſt retracting. Now to return to the party of whom you particularly required my opinion, and who indeed is the firſt ſubject of this <hi>Letter.</hi> I muſt ingeniouſly confeſs unto you, that next to <hi>Beer</hi> and <hi>Phiſick,</hi> I never found any thing ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſtefull as his works: he wanteth (almoſt throughout) even natural <hi>Logick,</hi> yea, that part thereof which proveth men to be reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. In three words he ſpeaks four bad ones, and as he alwayes ſtrayeth from the ſubject whereof he treateth, ſo doth he ordinarily talk in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known language, though he intend to ſpeak <hi>French:</hi> Beſides, Ice it ſelf is not more cold then his conceits, and when he deſires to be facetious (as at every turn he fain would) he had need to be in fee with his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make him laugh, as at Funerals in <hi>Paris,</hi> weepers are uſually hired for money. There is no queſtion but truth were of far more force, and diſarmed, then it can be with the aſſiſtance this ſimple fellow would ſtrive to affoard her: Now ſuppoſing ſuch men were ingaged in the right, without any treacherous deſign, yet is it as much as to abandon Gods cauſe, to ſuffer it to be ſupported by ſo weak and unworthy Pens. The <hi>Renegadoes</hi> have not ſo much wronged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſtianity, as thoſe who have not valiantly defended themſelves againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> &amp; ſuch who through defect of conduct &amp; ſkill, though they wanted neither zeal, nor affection, ſuffer themſelves to be ſurprized by the ſame advantages, they other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might have had over their enemies. Truely the Empire of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked doth much more maintain it ſelf by our puſillanimity, then by its own power or forces; nor doth any thing cauſe virtue to be ſo badly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, as doth the weak and unſkilfull teaching and explanation thereof. It were therefore requiſite, ſome wiſe man, who had been in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, where there is continual debate, and where there is never either peace or truce, (called the Colledge of <hi>Sarbon,</hi>) and who beſides had the art to make good things gratefull, &amp; could bring matters to attonement by a ſweet hand; ſhould come to cleanſe the Court from thoſe opinions lately introduced, and cure Souls inſtead of wounding them with inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. It was that great Cardinal who triumphed over all humane ſpirits, and whoſe memory ſhall ever be ſacred, ſo long as there remain any Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, or that oblation is offered on earth. It was I ſay the Cardinal of <hi>Perron,</hi> who was able to ſhew <hi>Epicurus</hi> himſelf, ſomething more ſublime and tranſcendent then this life, and cauſe his fleſhly Soul to be cape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of the greateſt ſecrets of Chriſtian Religion. Though this man had a dignity equal in height to the greateſt Conquerors and Monarchs: Yet had he (in what concerned Religion) an heart as humble as that of decreped men and Infants. How often hath he (with thoſe two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent qualities) impoſed ſilence upon all Philoſophy, and ſpoken of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine matters, with as great perſpicuity as though he had already been in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:120345:80"/>
                        <hi>Heaven;</hi> or had ſeen the ſame Devine verity wholy diſcovered, whereof here on earth, we have onely a confuſed underſtanding, and imperfect knowledge. To tell you in plain terms, but for the works of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perſon, which I as highly eſteem as the victories of the late <hi>King</hi> his Maſter, and wherein I deſire alwayes to leave mine eyes, when I am neceſſitated to give over reading: I had been much troubled to retire my ſelf from the tracing the book you ſent me, ſince any miſchief doth ſo eaſily catch hold of me, when I come near it, as I can hardly look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a begger without taking the itch, and my imagination is ſo tender and delicate, as it is ſenſible, and afflicted at the ſight of any baſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; yet thanks be to God, and the Antidote I continually take, I am the better armed againſt the conſpiracie you intended againſt me: and have yet life in me, after having been under a fools hands longer then I deſired. But by what I can gather, he is notwithſtanding in good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in the place where you are, and likely enough to finde ſtore of ſuch as will follow him, in that he is head of an evil partie. I can here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto anſwer you nothing, ſave onely that between this place and the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains, good wits do ſometimes ſtray from common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as from a thing too vulgar; and do often take counterfeit virtues, yea, even thoſe who have not any reſemblance to the right, for perfect verities: But when I conſider, how there is ſcarce any kinde of beaſt which hath not heretofore been adored among <hi>Idolaters,</hi> nor any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe incident either to the body, or minde of man, whereunto Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hath not erected Temples. I do not at all marvel, why divers men do ſometimes eſteem of thoſe, who are no way deſerving; or why ſimple people ſhould hold Sots in high reputation, ſince they have addreſſed incenſe to <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Crocadiles.</hi> The thing I moſt vex at herein, is, that both your ſelf and I, are in ſome ſort obliged to the <hi>Author</hi> of the book you ſent me, and that I have received the beginnings of my ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and firſt tincture of <hi>Learning</hi> from the laſt, and leaſt eſtimable of all men. For my part, I proteſt before all the World, I am not for all that guilty, either of the follies he will fall into, or of any ſuch as he hath formerly committed: and that having had much ado to purifie my underſtanding from the ordures of the Colledge, and to quit my ſelf from perverſe ſtudies; I have now no other pretention, but to follow ſuch as can no way be reproachable unto me. Howſoever, I ſhould not reject <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> though my Nurſe had died of the <hi>Pox;</hi> and it may ſometimes happen, that a bungling Maſon may lay ſome few ſtones in the building of the <hi>Loover,</hi> or at the Queen-mothers Pallace.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Letter</hi> newly delivered unto me from you, is but three moneths and an half old: it is an age wherein men are yet young, yet ſome <hi>Popes</hi> have not reigned ſo long, and in the ſtate wherein the <hi>Churches</hi> affairs have often ſtood. You might have written unto me at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of one <hi>Papacy,</hi> and I had received yours at the end of another; howſoever, I can no way better imploy my patience, then in attending my good fortune; and as it was the uſe to be invited a year before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to the <hi>Sybarites</hi> Feaſts, ſo is it fitting you make me long attend the moſt perfect content I enjoy in this World. I doubt not but <hi>T. T.</hi> ſeeketh all occaſions to do me ill offices, and that my abſence affoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him much advantage to wrong me; but on the other ſide, I cannot think men will more readily believe mine enemies words, then mine own actions; or that it is ſufficient onely to ſlander an honeſt man, to make him preſently wicked. It is true what he ſaith, that I am not very uſefull for <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What confeſſion of Faith ſoever <hi>R.</hi> makes, I will not imagine he can ever be really altered: I had rather both for mine own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and his honour belive, it is onely a voyage he hath made into the Adverſaries Countrey, to the end to bring us ſome news, and to give us account of what paſſeth at <hi>Charenton:</hi> Surely, I ſuppoſe, I ſhould not wrong him ſo much in holding him for a Spie among Enemies, as to call him a forſaker of his ſide, and a Fugitive from that Church, whereto he hath at leaſt this obligation, (if he will confeſs no other) that it is ſhe who made him a Chriſtian. You may do me a courteſie, to make me acquainted with the cauſe moving him to forſake us, and to go from thoſe Maxims he hath ſo often preached unto me; <hi>That a wiſe man dies in the Religion of his Mother: That he never alters his opinion: That he never repents himſelf of his ſorepaſſed life therein: That all No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties are to him ſuſpicious.</hi>

I have right particular, and moſt

tender ſenſibilities for thoſe courteſies I receive, but they are in ſpecial regard with me, when they come from a perſon of ſo high eſtimation in my thoughts as he is, and of whom I ſhould ſtill have much to ſay, after I had related, how amidſt the corruption of this age, and in the authority Vice therein hath gained, he hath notwithſtanding the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, to continue an upright man, and bluſheth not at Chriſtian vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, nor vanteth of Moral ones. I hope to ſee him within few dayes, and to take poſſeſſion of ſome ſmall corner in his Houſe at <hi>Pompona,</hi> which he hath provided for me, there to breath at mine eaſe, and to ſet my ſpirits ſometimes at liberty. In the interim you muſt needs know, about what I buſie my ſelf, and that I tell you, I entertain a fool, in whom I finde all the Actors in a Comedy, and all ſorts of extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies incident to the ſpirit of man. After my books have buſied me all the morning, and that I am weary of their company, I ſpend ſome part of the after-noon with him, partly to divert my thoughts from ſerious things, which do but nouriſh my <hi>Melancholy.</hi> Ever ſince I came into this World, I have been perpetually troubleſome to my ſelf, I have found all the hours of my life tedious unto me; I have done nothing all day, but ſeek for night. Wherefore if I deſire to be merry, I muſt neceſſarily deceive my ſelf, and my felicity is ſo dependant upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior things, that without <hi>Painting, Muſick,</hi> and divers other divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, how great a Muſer ſoever I am, I have not ſufficient wherewith to entertain my ſelf, or to be pleaſed. Think not therefore, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my fool, or my books are ſufficient to ſettle my contentment; nay, rather if you have any care of me, or if you deſire I ſhould have no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be ſad, make me partaker of all the news hapning in the place where you are; let me ſee the whole Court by your eyes, cauſe me to aſſiſt at all Sermons by your ears, give me accompt of the good and bad paſſages hapning this Winter, and that there part not a poſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with a Gazetto of your ſtile, as there ſhall not any go hence, who ſhall not bring you ſome viſion of my retiredneſs.</p>
                     <p>There runs a rumour in theſe parts, that <hi>Mounſieur de Boudeville</hi> is ſlain, but ſince there are not many more hard atchievements to be wrought, then that, it is too great a death to be believed upon the firſt report.</p>

You are wiſe, and have not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the ſame with loſs of your beſt years; you are born the ſame we deſire to be at the beſt: on what ſide ſoever you caſt your eyes, you finde preſent felicities, and certain hopes; and were there neither <hi>Loover</hi> nor Pallace to promiſe you preferments or Offices, the houſe where you are, may alone make you happy.

What likelyhood is it then, this being ſo, you ſhould be of your Letters opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and that you cannot be without me?

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Come to renew my old importunity, and require your Authority, to call the Printers of <hi>Paris</hi> to account: They have ſet forth, in my name, certain Letters, which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be mine, and deny not to father; but yet they ought to have been counſel to them, conſidering I never meant they ſhould gadd about the ſtreets. By this means, when I think I am in my Cloſer, I finde my ſelf upon the Stage; they carry me abroad, when I deſire to be private, and what I intended an incloſure to my friends, they lay in common for all the Countrey. You know Sir, that this kinde of writing hath alwayes been privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; and that many things are entruſted to the boſom of Letters, which neither curioſity, nor hatred ought to prye into: nor ever will, if that be any thing diſcreet; This, any thing generous. An Enemy in War, that neither ſpares mens goods nor lives, yet makes a conſcience of opening Letters: the Law of ſecrets prevailing againſt the deſire of revenge: Yet ſo unfortunate am I, that what an Enemy will not offer in War, I ſuffer in peace; and that by men, that have no cauſe to wiſh me ill. I have nothing ſo properly mine, which they think not as properly theirs; Nothing kept ſo cloſe, which they bring not to light. If hold could be laid on intellectual things, they would dive (I think) into the very thoughts of my heart: but ſince their arms are too ſhort for this, they ſnatch them from me as ſoon as ever I have made them ſenſible, and given them a body upon Paper; in ſuch ſort Sir, that I ſhould not dare to write my very Auricular Confeſſion, for fear they ſhould put it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:120345:86"/>
in Print, and make it be cried upon the Exchange; and I muſt be forced at laſt, either to renounce all commerce in this kinde, or at leaſt to invent ſome ſtrange unknown Characters to ſpeak in ſecret, and to preſerve my conceits from their arreſting. They arrogate to themſelves a more ſoveraign power than Princes do, who alwayes leave to private men, the free uſe of that which is theirs, and never offer to make a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of my Garden, nor a thorough-fare of my Court-yard. This is a diſorder, where of the conſequence reflects upon you, and wherein you are more intereſted than my ſelf; for I do not believe you would be willing to ſee thoſe excellent diſcourſes, which I have heard you make at the opening of your Courts; and be disfigured by an uncorrected impreſſion; and it would grieve you that prophane hands ſhould touch them without choice or diſcretion, and thereby marre their luſtre, and defile their purity. I therefore humbly intreat you in this point to take care of your ſelf, and to do your ſelf right: The boldneſs of theſe mercenary perſons is not reſtrained by reſpect, it muſt have a ſtronger bridle; and if you give it not a ſtop by fear of puniſhment; neither our Cloſets, nor our Beds will have any thing ſo ſecret, which will not be cried upon the Market place, and to ſpeak in the Comedians phraſe, That which <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Juno</hi> in her ear, ſhall be made Table talk for all the people. You being as you are, the cenſor of manners and Pylot of the ſtate; it belongs to your place to reſtrain this ſo Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal an uſurpation upon the liberty of mens ſpirits, and whileſt you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend from violence our fortunes and our lives; you muſt not expoſe to the ſame violence other of our goods, no leſs dear to us than thoſe. And herein I promiſe to my ſelf ſome conſideration of my own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and that for my ſake, you will let your courteſie go further than your Juſtice. And having obliged me to you already upon the like occaſion; I doubt not but you will maintain that firſt favour with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and make the Printers know that you have taken my name and writings into your protection, to defend them againſt all their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes. This ſhall be to me a ſingular favour, and which ſhall binde me all my life to ſeek out means to teſtifie, that I am</p>

                     <p>HAving adventured to ſpeak Latin, I feared my boldneſs might have had but ill ſucceſs; and I doubted whether in a forraign Countrey I might paſs for an enemy, or for a friend. But your Letter hath given me aſſurance of my condition. I account it as the Letters Pattents of my naturalizing; and where I was afraid to be held a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> I ſee my ſelf ſuddenly become a <hi>Roman.</hi> For ſince there is now no more uſe that can ſerve for the Law; nor people that can ſerve for the Judge of a dead language; I have therefore recourſe to you Sir, in whom I ſeem to ſee the very face of the moſt pure antiquity; and who, after the diſſolution of the body of the Common-wealth, doth yet preſerve the ſpirit. The <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> have boaſted falſly that they left in it nothing remarkable: I finde ſtill the full Majeſty of the language in your writings; and your ſtile hath in it, not onely the Aire and Garb of that good time; but the very courage and the virtue. You draw your opinions from the ſame Well, and I ſee no cauſe that any man can have to contradict them. It is certain, that to gain belief, one muſt keep himſelf within the bounds of likelyhood; and preſent to poſterity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, which it may follow; and not Prodigies, with which it may be frighted. Words that are diſproportionable to the matter, ſeem to ſavour of that Mountibanks ſtrain; who would have it believed, he could make a ſtatue of a Mountain, and would perſwade us, that a man were a mile long. There are ſome mens works, not much leſs extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant than this Mountibanks deſign; and moſt men ſeem to write with as little ſeriouſneſs; and with as little care to be believed. And though men make a conſcience in dealing with particular perſons; yet when they come to deal with the publick, they ſeem to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diſpenſed with; and that they owe more reſpect to one neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour than to whole Nations, and to all ages to come. You know not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, that this is no new vice; and not to make a troubleſom enumeration of the ancient adorers of favour: Is not that baſe flattering of <hi>Velleim</hi> come even to us? and was he not a Bond ſlave, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired one ſhould know he was in love with his Chain? I could curſe the ill fortune of good Letters, that hath bereft us of the book which <hi>Brutus</hi> writ of vertue; and in lieu hath left us the infamous poſſeſſion, which that villain makes of his looſneſs, and how he had more care of the dregs of a corrupted Court; than of upholding the main ſtructure of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Philoſophy. If it had been his fortune to have out-lived <hi>Sejanus;</hi> I doubt not, but he would have taken from him all the praiſes he had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:120345:87"/>
given him to make a preſent of them to his ſucceſſour <hi>Macron:</hi> and if the gaps and breaches of his book were filled up, one ſhould ſee he had not forgotten ſo much as a Groom in all <hi>Tiberius</hi> houſe of whom he had not written <hi>Encomiums.</hi> We live in a Government much more juſt, and therefore much more commendable; the raign of our King is not barren of great examples. It is impoſſible the carriage of <hi>M.</hi> the Cardinal ſhould be more dextrous, more ſage, more active than it is: yet who knows not that he hath found work enough to do for many ages, and Battails enough to fight for many Worthies: That he hath met with difficulties worthy of the tranſcendent forces of himſelf, far exceeding the forces of any other; it is neceſſary, that time it ſelf ſhould joyn in labour with excellent Maſter-workmen to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the perfection of excellent works. The recovery of a waſted body, is not the work of onely one potion; or once opening a vein: the reviving a decayed eſtate, requires a reiteration of endeavours, and a conſtancy of labours. The ſalving of deſperate caſes goes not ſo ſwift a pace, as Poets deſcriptions, or Figures of Orators. We muſt therefore keep the extenſion of our ſubject within certain bounds; and not ſay, that the victory is perfected, as long as it leaves us the evills of War, and that there remains any Monſter to be vanquiſhed, ſeeing even poverty is yet remaining, which is one of the greateſt Monſters; and in compariſon whereof, thoſe which <hi>Hercules</hi> ſubdued, were but tame and gentle. With time, our Redeemer will finiſh his work; and he that hath given us ſecurity, will give us alſo no doubt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. But ſeeing the order of the world, and the neceſſity of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs affords us not yet to taſte this happines; it ſhall be a joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, to ſee at leaſt, the Image of it in your Hiſtory: to return and re-enter by your means into theſe three, ſo rich and flouriſhing years, after which the peace hath ſhewed it ſelf but by fits; and the Sun it ſelf hath been more reſerved of his beams, and not ripened our fruits but on one ſide. You ſhall binde me infinitely unto you, to grant me a ſight of this rare Peece, and to allow me a Key of that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which you keep ſhut to all the World beſides, I aſſure my ſelf I ſhall ſee nothing there but that which is ſtately and Magnificent; ſpecially I doubt not but the roof it ſelf is admirable, and that your words do Parallell the ſubject, when you come to ſpeak of the laſt Deſigns of our deceaſed <hi>King;</hi> and of the undoubted revolution he had brought upon the ſtate of the World, if he had lived. And though in this there be more of divination than of knowledge; and that to ſpeak of ſuch things be to expound Riddles; yet in ſuch caſes it is not denied to be <hi>Speculative;</hi> and I do not believe that <hi>Lyvie</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting the death of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> did lightly paſs over the Voyage he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended againſt the <hi>Parthians;</hi> and that he ſtayed not a little to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:120345:87"/>
the new face he would have put upon the Common-wealth, if death had not prevented him. If all my affairs lay here, yet I would make a journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> expreſly for this; and to read a diſcourſe, made after the faſhion of this Epitaph, which pleaſed me exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>He had a deſign to win</hi> Rhodes <hi>and overcome</hi> Italy. I ſhould have much ado to hold in my Paſſion till then; but now I ſtand waiting for your <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that I may learn of him that patience, which he teacheth, that I ſaint not in waiting till it be printed; what a croud there will be to ſee him, when he ſhall be in ſtate to be ſeen; and when he ſhall come abroad under your corrections; like to thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious bodies, which being cleanſed from all impurity of matter, do gliſter and ſhine on every ſide. This is an Authour with whom your Preface would have made me friends, if I had otherwiſe been fallen out; and that the hardneſs of his phraſe, and the vices of his age had given me any diſtaſte from reading him. But it is long ſince that I have held him in account; and as ſad and thorny as he is, yet he hath not been unpleaſing to me. Me thinks I finde his writings, that dark light; or lightſom darkneſs, which an ancient Poet ſpeaks off; and I look upon the obſcurity of his writing, as I ſhould look upon a piece of Ebone that were well wrought and poliſhed. This hath been ever my opinion of him. As the beauties of <hi>Africa,</hi> do not therefore leave to be Amiable, becauſe they are not like to ours; and as <hi>Sophonisbe</hi> would have carried the prize from many <hi>Italian</hi> faces; ſo the wits of the ſame Countrey do not leave to pleaſe, though their eloquence be a forreiner: and for my part I prefer this man before many that take upon them to be imitators of <hi>Cicero.</hi> Let it be granted to delicate ears, that his ſtile is of Iron: but then let it be granted alſo, that of this Iron, many excellent Armours have been forged; that with it he hath defended the honour and innocency of Chriſtianity; with it he hath put the <hi>Valentinians</hi> to flight, and hath pierced the very heart of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion.</hi> You ſee I want not much of declaiming in his praiſe; but to avoid this inconvenience, I think beſt to break off abruptly. I am neither good at making Orations, nor at venting of Complements; I am a bad Advocate, and as bad a Courtier: yet I entreat you to believe that I very truely am</p>

                     <p>SIR, no modeſty is able to reſiſt the praiſes that come from you, And I vow unto you, I took a pleaſure to ſuffer my ſelf to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:120345:88"/>
with the firſt lines of your Letter. But it muſt be one that knows himſelf leſs then I do, that dwels long in this errour. After a pleaſing dream, one is willing to awake; and I ſee well enough, that when you ſpeak ſo much in the praiſe of my work; you make not uſe of the whole integrity of your judgement. You do me a favour, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay you do me juſtice; you ſeem to have a will to oblige me to you, by hazarding to incurre the diſpleaſure of truth. Now that you are your ſelf at the Goal, you encourage with all your forces thoſe that are in the race; and to perſwade them to follow you; make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they ſhall go beyond you. An admirable trick of Art, I muſt confeſs; and which at firſt I did not diſcover. But whatſoever it be, and from what ground ſoever this wonderfull commendation of yours proceeds; I eſteem it not leſs than an ambitious man doth a Crown; and without piercing into your purpoſe, I take a joy in my good fortune: which is not ſmall Sir, to be loved of you, whom I have alwayes exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly eſteemed: and whom I have a long time looked upon in the <hi>Huguenot</hi> party, as an excellent Pylot that affronts a great Fleet, being himſelf but in Pinnace. The right and authority is on our ſide; the plots and Stratagems on yours, and you ſeem not leſs confident in your courage, than we in our cauſe. It is certain, that this is the way to give a ſedition the ſhew of a juſt War: and to a multitude of mutiners the face of a well ordered Army. By this you keep many in a good opinion of that which hath now loſt the attractive grace of Novelty; and though it be now bending to its declination; yet it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but that it holds ſtill ſome colour, and ſome apparance, by the Varniſh of your writings; and that never man hath more ſubtilly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his cauſe from ſhew of weakneſs; nor more ſtrongly upheld his ſide from ruine than your ſelf:

                           <l>Defendi poſſent, etiam hac Defenſa fuiſſent.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is my ordinary language, when it comes in my way to ſpeak of you. I am not of the paſſionate humour of the vulgar; which blanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the liberty of their judgement; and findes never any fault in their own ſide, nor virtue in the oppoſite. For my ſelf, from what cloud ſoever the day break; I account it fair; and aſſure my ſelf that at <hi>Rome</hi> honeſt men commended <hi>Hannibal;</hi> and none but Porters and baſe people ſpake baſely of him. It is indeed a kinde of ſacriledge to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt any man, whatſoever he be, of the gifts of God, and if I ſhould not acknowledge that you have received much; I ſhould be injurious to him that hath given you much; and in a different cauſe wrong an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Benefactour. It is true, I have not alwayes flattered the ill diſpoſed <hi>French;</hi> and was put in ſome choler againſt the Authors of our laſt broils; but obſerving in your writings that our Tenets are alike;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:120345:88"/>
and that the ſubjection due to Princes is a part of the Religion you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs; I have thought I might well ſpeak by your conſent, as much as I ſaid: and in ſo doing, be but your Interpreter. Whether the tempeſt riſe from the Northern winde, or from the Southern; it is to me equally unpleaſing; and in that which concerns my duty; I neither take Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel from <hi>England,</hi> nor yet from <hi>Spain.</hi> My humour is not to wreſtle with the time; and to make my ſelf an Antagoniſt of the preſent; it is pain enough for me onely to conceive the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Cato,</hi> and <hi>Caſſius;</hi> and being to live under the command of another, I finde no virtue more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting than obedience. If I were a <hi>Switzer,</hi> I would think it honour enough to be the <hi>Kings</hi> Goſſip; and would not be his ſubject, nor change my liberty for the beſt Maſter in the World; but ſince, it hath pleaſed God to have me born in chains, I bear them willingly; and finding them neither cumberſom nor heavy, I ſee no cauſe I ſhould break my teeth, in ſeeking to break them. It is a great argument, that Heaven approves that government, which hath continued its ſucceſſion now a dozen ages: an evil that ſhould laſt ſo long, might in ſome ſort ſeem to be made Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate, and if the age of men be venerable, certainly that of ſtates ought to be holy. Theſe great ſpirits which I ſpeak of in my work, and which have been of your party, ſhould have come in the beginning of the World, to have given Laws to new people; and to have ſetled an eſtabliſhment in the politick eſtate; but as it is neceſſary to invent good Laws, ſo certainly it is dangerous to change even thoſe that are bad. Theſe are the moſt cruel thoughts that I entertain againſt the heads of your party: in this ſort I handle the adverſe ſide; and take no pleaſure to inſult upon your miſeries, as you ſeem civilly to charge me, who have written that the <hi>King</hi> ſhould be applauded of all the World, if after he hath beaten down the pride of the Rebels, he would not tread upon the calamity of the afflicted. The perſecutors of thoſe, who ſubmit themſelves, are to me in equal execration with the violatours of Sepulchers; and I have not onely pitty of their affliction, but in ſome ſort reverence. I know that places ſtrucken with light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, have ſometimes been held Sacred. The finger of God hath been reſpected in them, whom it hath touched; and great adverſities have ſometimes rather given a Religious reſpect, than received a reproach. But thus to ſpeak of the good ſucceſs of the <hi>Kings</hi> armies were to ſpeak properly: Both ſides have gained by his victory. All the penalty that hath been impoſed upon you; hath been but this, to make you as happy as our ſelves, and you are now in quiet poſſeſſion of that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for which before your Towns were taken, you were but ſuppliants. Our Prince will put no yoke upon the conſciences of his ſubjects; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires not to make that to be received by force; which cannot be received but by perſwaſion; nor to uſe ſuch remedies againſt the <hi>French,</hi> which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:120345:89"/>
are not good, but againſt the <hi>Moors.</hi> If the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Sweden</hi> uſe his proſperity in this manner, and ſoil not ſo pure a grace with proſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and puniſhments; I make you a faithfull promiſe to do that which you deſire me to do; to employ all my cunning and all my Engines to erect a ſtatue to the memory of his name. You touch the right ſtring of my inclination, when you pray me to praiſe and to magnifie that Prince, If all the Crowns that are wrought upon his Scarf ſhould be changed into ſo many Kingdoms, they could never in my opinion ſufficiently recompence ſo rare a virtue; not be able to fill ſo vaſte a Spirit as his is: As I expect nothing but great from his valour, ſo from his honeſty I hope for nothing but good; and although in <hi>Spain</hi> it be currant that he is the true Antichriſt; yet I am neither ſo devout to believe ſuch a fable, nor ſo fearfull to be afraid of ſuch a dream.

Beſides, my diſcourſe may ſeem already long, if not too long, for a beginning of acquaintance; pardon I beſeech you, the contentment I take to be this way with you, which makes me forget both your employments, and my own cuſtom: which is not to be troubleſom to any, much leſs to make Sermons to my friends; but your ſelf gave me the Text I have handled, and I cannot doubt, but that having opened unto you the bottom of my heart, without diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation; you will give my liberty the credit of your belief, and with this I ſolemnly aſſure you that I truely am,</p>

My affection hath gone beyond my action, and I have put my ſelf to the venture to go as far as <hi>Gaſcogny</hi> to ſeek you out. If you had gone by <hi>Cadillac,</hi> as I was told you would, you had found me at the waters ſide at your diſinbarking, and I ſhould have put hard with the beſt of the Countrey to have had the honour to offer you my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice firſt of any, but God did not think me worthy of my deſires. It was his pleaſure I ſhould make a journey of fifty leagues not to ſee you, and I conceive my happineſs to be ſuch, that if I ſhould go to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> with the like intention, God would preſently inſpire the <hi>Kings</hi> heart to ſend you away in ſome Embaſſage: Be pleaſed therefore, Sir, to ſpare me this travail; I dare undertake no ſecond voyage, for fear leaſt ſuch a thought onely ſhould remove you from the ſtation where all the good of life is ſeated, and out of which a man can have no contentment, but what he can get by the force of reaſon and Philoſophy. It ſufficeth me that I have this one way left me, to preſent you my complements; and that from time to time I can make you read that your <hi>Idea</hi> is the dear company of my ſolitude, and your reputation, the comfortable trouble of my repoſe. In the eſtate I now am in, this in effect, is all the part I claim in the affairs of the World; theſe are the news for which I retain ſtill my whole enquiry; I profeſs unto you the publick proſperities would be leſs dear unto me, if yours were not bound up in one volume with them. It doth not trouble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> me I confeſs that our affairs are proſperous, and that our armies have glorious ſucceſs, but to think that you are one of the inſtruments of ſo flouriſhing a Kingdom, and that the <hi>King</hi> makes uſe of your Pen to communicate himſelf to his own people, and to ſtrangers, and to diſtribute both good and evil to all <hi>Europe,</hi> this is that which raviſheth me with extremity of joy. From your words are framed the Oracles that are at this day given to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, you trouble not your brains any more with the petty intereſts of <hi>Tytius</hi> and <hi>Maevius; Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> are now your clients; and the Princes that either fear or ſuffer oppreſſion, expect their deſtinies from your anſwers.

Gold when it was yet in the Mine, I remember your happy entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, and that you have not needed a time of probation for being perfectly an honeſt man, you ſaid things to me in your infancie, which I make uſe of now in my old age; and I keep for a Monument a Letter you once writ to me from <hi>Villeſavin</hi> as a ſeed of all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches, and of all the inſtructions you ſhall ever make. At that time I was proud of my fortune, and you gave me leave to boaſt of your friendſhip, I dare not now uſe the privacy of ſuch terms; it is fit my ambition ſhould be more modeſt and more moderate. I crave now onely an acknowledging and a protection, and this I hope, Sir, you will not deny me; but take me for one of the charges deſcended upon you, with the inheritance of Mounſieur <hi>d' Aire</hi> your deceaſed Uncle; Bear with my paſſion as a thing of your own, and which you cannot put away, ſince in effect I am and never be other.</p>

You are one of thoſe whoſe leaſt favours are <hi>Obligatorie,</hi> and you never caſt them from you ſo careleſly, but that they deſerve to be carefully gathered. When others bear you affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and hold you dear, it is but to be juſt, and to pay debts; but when you do the like to others, it is to be liberal, and to beſtow fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. You may then imagine what glory I account it, that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of my ſpirit hath the approbation of your judgement, and I am not a little glad that my inclination hath ſo good ſucceſs, not to be hated of one whom I ſhould love, though he hated me. For a train to this firſt favour I require from you a ſecond; be pleaſed Sir that I aſk you, if it be in truth my ſelf whom you exhort to moderation, whether you think in your conſcience that I am fallen into the vice contrary to this virtue? It is now four years that I ſuffer outrages; they think it not enough to do me wrongs unleſs they print them too; they do me hurt, and would have me think my ſelf beholding to them for it; an infinite Army of Enemies are come into the Field againſt me, under the Colours of <hi>Philarque;</hi> it is not two or three private men, it is whole Companies, whole Troups that ſet upon me: I am the Martyr of a thouſand Tyrants, and if this unhappy influence paſs not over, or abate not, I ſhall come at laſt to be the object of perſecution for all the World. They have painted me out a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick ſinner amongſt honeſt men; a man that cannot read amongſt Schollers; a mad man amongſt the ſober: Theſe good Offices they have done me hitherto without any revenging; I am as yet a deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of theſe charities to them that have lent them to me; I have taken theſe blows with hardineſs in ſtead of repelling them with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:120345:91"/>
force; and my patience hath been ſuch, that many have called it want of courage: If this be ſo, you will grant me Sir, that you trouble your ſelf about that which cannot be; that another mans praiſes ſhould be inſupportable to me, when I have not been ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of my own Calumnies: I am not like to be in haſte to hinder by my violence the making of friendſhip, who have by my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſeneſs as it were conſented to my own hatred. There is no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to think that I ſhould complain of words ſeigned, and ſuch as declaimers uſe in ſport, who have not ſo much as ſpoken a word of the moſt cruel action, that ever the moſt premeditated malice could bring forth. Let our friend, if he pleaſe, make an Epitaph or a deifying of — let him imploy all his Morter and all his Art to build him either a Sepulcher or a Temple, and to ſpeak after the manner of — let him erect him a ſhrine, and place him amongſt his houſhold ſaints: I ſay nothing againſt all this, nor condemne his proceeding, whether it be that he honour the memory and merit of the dead, or that he ſtand in awe of the credit and faction of his heirs. I eaſily bear with theſe ſmall ſpots in my friends, and exact no more of them than they can well ſpare. I know that Greek and Latine make not men valiant, nor are things that deſcended to the bottom of the Soul, they ſcarce reach to the uttermoſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies: they ſtay commonly in the memory and in the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and poliſh the tongue without fortifying the heart: I ſhould therefore deſire too much, if I ſhould deſire at all that theſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowledges ſhould get a new virtue for my ſake, and ſhould work a greater effect in the ſpirit of — than they wrought in the Poet <hi>Lucan,</hi> whom fear conſtrained to accuſe his Mother, and to praiſe a Tyrant. If it ſtay but upon me that this dear Childe ſhould ſee the light, after ſo many ſower looks and ſo many throws, I am ready my ſelf to ſerve for a Midwife. I am content it ſhall be publiſhed to day, and to morrow be tranſlated into all languages, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor may not loſe a day in his glory, and that his glory be not bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within River or Mountain. Never fear that I will impair his ill nights, or add the care of one proceſs to his ordinary watchings; if he have no other unquietneſs but what he is like to have from me, he may be ſure to enjoy a perpetual calm, and a perfect tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; if he be not awaked but by the noiſe you think I will make him, he may ſleep as long as <hi>Epimenides,</hi> who going to bed a young man was fifty years elder when he roſe. Beſides, I have too much care of my own quiet, to go about to trouble his; and I love his contentmens too well, not to procure it, being to coſt me nothing, but the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling his weakneſs, And this I entreat you Sir, to aſſure him from me. But knowing you to be wiſe and virtuous in the degree you are,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:120345:92"/>
I doubt not, but of your own head, you will tell him, that it becomes not a man of his gravity, to countenance ſuch petty things; and in a point of Schollarſhip to uſe as much formality and ceremony, as if it were the Negotiation of an Ambaſſador; but much more, that it is a baſe quality to juggle with his friends; and after having ſaid a truth, which was not for all mens taſte; to make a Comment upon it, of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſter. I have read <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and the books of — and therefore ſhould know the ſtile of <hi>Tyberius;</hi> and the Art of Equivocation; but I ſhould be loath to ſeem ingenious, to the prejudice of mine honour; and to make uſe of poyſon, though I had one ſo ſubtil that would kill without leaving any mark to be ſeen; I have loved man in affliction; and have made uſe of men in miſery: Lightning hath not driven me from places, which it hath made frightfull; I have given teſtimony of my affection, not onely where it could not be acknowledged, but where it was in danger to be puniſhed. I am not now ſo dealt withall my ſelf; and yet if the juſtice of my cauſe were not as it is to be regarded, me thinks the violence of my adverſaries ought to procure me ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; doth not even honour oblige thoſe that have any feeling of it, not to joyn with the multitude which caſts it ſelf upon a ſingle man? Oppreſſion hath alwayes been a ſufficient ground for protection; and noble mindes never ſeek better Title for defending the weake, than the need there is of them; and to take part with a ſtranger, it is cauſe enough that many aſſault him, and few aſſiſt him, and ſuch alſo I doubt not is your minde: I am not leſs perſwaded of the generouſneſs of your minde; than of the greatneſs of your ſpirit, and aſſure my ſelf you are not the leſs on my ſide, becauſe I have many perſecutors, as becauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, I am firmly,</p>

which you make ſuch draughts, it ſurpaſſeth all the colours that we uſe here to paint withall, and yet the beauty coſts you nothing; but you ſhall hardly make me believe it; I know Gold and Azure, and can eaſily diſtinguiſh it from coal; I ſee Sir the Ambuſhes you lay for me; The facility of your ſtile covers the force of it, but weakens it not, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſhew of careleſneſs, I finde true Art and Ornaments.

                     <p>I Learn by the <hi>Gazette</hi> that you have received a wound at <hi>Mastrick;</hi> ſo it be light I forgive it you; but though it be but a ſcratch I love you too well not to accuſe you of too much forwardneſs. They that are poor in reputation ought to preſs up to the trenches; and ſuch fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is as well beſeeming freſh Souldiers as young Fryers; but for you, you have ſeen too many wars to be called by the firſt name, and your valour having been ſhewed in the preſence of the Prince, and approved by the teſtimony of the very enemy; it ſeems to me that your part is not ſo much to bring it forth as a new matter, as to keep it up as a known good. I would have you make good actions, as you uſe to do; but I would have you do it now, if it might be had with a body charmed and with inchanted Arms, that leaving behinde you all danger, you might have before you nothing but glory. If God had given us three or four lives, we might at any time venture one, and ſometimes in a bravery let one go, being aſſured we have another in ſtore; but to be prodigal in poverty, and to be careleſs of ones head when no art can make him a new; this is a point hath no apparence of reaſon. We muſt not ſet ſo light by the beauties of heaven and the Rayes of viſible things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor turn our eyes from a ſpectacle ſo magnificently erected for us: I offend perhaps the ears of your courage with this diſcourſe, and you are like to ſend my counſel away as it came; yet take not diſtaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully an officious injury and think it not ſtrange that I acquaint you with my fears, ſeeing a goddeſs was not aſhamed to attire her Son in Womans habit to preſerve him; it would grieve me exceedingly to ſee you come halting home, or with but one eye, and to bring ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward favours from the Wars; I will not be bound to flatter your grief with that word of a <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> mother, <hi>Courage my Son; you cannot now take a ſtep that puts you not in minde of your virtue,</hi> and leſs with that example in the Hiſtories of <hi>Saluſt,</hi> he made oſtentation of a face remarkable onely for ſkars, and for having but one eye, wherein he took a pleaſure, though it made him deformed, and cared not for loſing one part of himſelf, which made all the reſt the fuller of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Spare me I beſeech you this kinde of conſolation, which I ſhould give you, if you ſuffer the like loſſes; and be not ſo hot in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after a fair death, which can gain you nothing but a fair Epitaph. Give me belief onely this once, and after this I will leave you to your own belief, and commend you to your good Angel. You ſhall have leave to diſpoſe of your time ſome otherwiſe than thus; but remember

that Melons are paſt, and make not — ſtand waiting too long for you: Our Rivers never ran more clear, nor our Meddows were ever more green. I make uſe Sir of all things, both reaſonable and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to perſwade your return. In the name of God come and draw me out of the unquietneſs you have put me in; I have ſomething, I know not what, lies heavy at my heart, and nothing will lighten it but your company: That which a ſuperſtitious man would do for a dream, or for ſome idle preſage, do you I pray you for a friend: who carries you alwayes in his minde, and who is more than any in the World,</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>SIR, the Letter you did me the honour to write unto me, the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of the laſt Moneth came not to my hands till the beginning of this, otherwiſe I had ſooner given teſtimony how dear theſe laſt marks of your remembring me are unto me, and how much I receive of ſecret glorie, ſeeing all other is denied me, in that I have done any thing which ſeems not altogether unpleaſing to you. It is no ſmall matter to entertain eyes that uſe not to ſtay upon vulgar Objects; and to miniſter pleaſure to a minde, which hath nothing in it but law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full paſſions, and indeed Sir, the height, of my ambition is bounded there. If I had no other payment for all my travail, but onely your good opinion of it, I ſhould not complain for being ill paid; and your goodneſs hath made me full recompence for all the wrongs I have received. The number of my enemies is great, I ſee it well; the time doth not favour me, I confeſs it; but having your favour Sir, what can I fear under ſo powerfull a protection? Seeing thoſe to whom God hath given clearer eyes than to other men, and a more ſoveraign reaſon, as well as a more ſoveraign dignity, have no ill opinion of my opinions, what need I care for the cenſure of the baſe World? and how can I but hope that the truth aſſiſted by a few ſages, will be alwayes able to withſtand a multitude of Sophiſters? I now ſend you Sir my anſwer to ſuch of their Objections, that ſeem worth the refuting, and which have but any ſpark of apparance to dazle the eyes of ſimple peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the reſt are ſo ridiculous that I dare not oppugne them, for fear you ſhould think I had deviſed them my ſelf to make matter for diſcourſe; or that I coaped with them about points where I were ſure they could do me no hurt. And yet why ſhould I diſſemble my ill hap? Thoſe ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Objections finde abettours &amp; uphoulders; although I have juſtice on my ſide, yet am I ſued ſtill, and perſecuted by men I never offended;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:120345:94"/>
and that when I give over the field and intreat for my life, ſee the deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of cruel mindes towards thoſe that are good: They have no force, but becauſe I make no reſiſtance; they magnifie themſelves in the wrong of their advantage; they have not taken it; it is my ſelf have given it. Their firſt ſucceſſes, which my ſufferance hath incouraged; have been new bonds for the continuance; and becauſe I have uſed no words againſt their blows, they think I judge my ſelf worthy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure them; yet all this ſhall not make me change my reſolution, and I am bent to ſtay within the bounds into which I have voluntarily put my ſelf. Although I am neighbour to a Marſhals Court, yet I chuſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a diſgracefull quietneſs than to entertain the beſt quarrel in the World. I have got as it were a habit of careleſneſs, I dare not ſay of patience, leaſt I might be accuſed to praiſe my ſelf for a virtue. It may happen that their perſecution ſhall not continue ſo long as my innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and that I may ſee an end of that, which would be my end. It may be a calmer ſeaſon will follow after this, and perhaps the tempeſt, that threatens my head, will fall but at my feet. However the World go, I will alwayes comfort my ſelf with the Letter you did me the honour to write unto me. I will put your good will in ballance againſt all mens malice, and againſt all the injuries of Fortune; I will account my ſelf not altogether unhappy as long as I ſhall have place in your <hi>remembring me,</hi> and that you will believe I am</p>

I know your love to him, is one of the moſt ancient you ever had, and he therefore one of the firſt ſervants you ever enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: The choiſe of ſo judicious an infancie as yours, hath not, I dare ſay, been raſhly made; and I diſcover dayly by the opening of his heart and thoughts unto me, the reaſons you had to love him at firſt; I come not therefore as his Solicitour, but as his bare witneſs; and aſſure you moſt undoubtedly, that I know not a man living more religious towards

I concur with him in this opinion; and knowing that in this ſo general a corruption of the World, this age of ours owes unto you the laſte examples we ſee of goodneſs, and that without you neither the dead ſhould any more finde piety, nor the miſerable conſolation; I have conceived you will not take it ill that I confirm him in this belief, and that I take this occaſion to ſay that unto you, which in the ſuddenneſs of my departure, I had not time to ſay; that I am perfectly and ever</p>

                     <p>YOu are a better man than you would have me believe you are. Your words of fire and bloud agree ill with the ſweetneſs of your ſpirit, and having received from you a Letter of challenge, I expect from you another of friendſhip. You may make your profit of the good examples you have ſeen on that ſide the Mountains, but follow not the <hi>Italian</hi> examples of being captious and retaining of ſpleen, as if it were a Jewel. It is not fit the holy week ſhould paſs upon your choller with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out abating it. It would not be an act of courage, but a hardneſs of heart, and the beſt extremities partake ſo much of vice, that even ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream right is no better than ſupream wrong. Play not therefore the Tyrant towards your friend, but ſtay your ſelf within the bounds of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary juſtice. The limits that part juſtice from wrong are not ſo well marked out, but that one paſſeth them often before he is aware; and it is neither a lawfull greatneſs to make our ſelves terrible to thoſe that love us; nor an honeſt reſiſtance to ſtand obdurate to the prayers of men in miſery. But perhaps I offer remedies to one in better ſtate than my ſelf; perhaps I am affraid of an artificial choller, &amp; am frighted with that which is but a Vizard. It may be you have a deſire to know in what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree I love you, and that your hard dealing with me is but to try me; ſuch experiments would prove dangerous to any other man beſides your ſelf, but you may make them ſafely; for I make you promiſe that any patience ſhall be more inſenſible than your ſence is tender. But yet
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:120345:95"/>
muſe a little upon the honour of our friendſhip, and upon the opinion of the world. I did make confeſſion to you of my faults, and I am told you publiſh briefs of your diſlike; I have told you confidently that I ſuffer in it, and becauſe I did not tell it with a good grace, you are offended with the incivility of privacie. Me thinks you ſhould not exact from a plain Countrey man ſo punctual a diſcretion; by living amongſt clowns I have forgotten all the good manners I learn'd with you: the wild man you had civilized is returned back to his natural condition. I do not any longer walk in the Woods, I wander there; and had it not been to ſee my Lord Mayors ſhew, I had not been ſeen in the Citie; although to ſay the truth, ſo obſtinate a retyring might juſtly enough have been cenſured as a kind of rebellion; &amp; as the ſtudy of wiſedom takes from me all admiration of vain pomp, ſo yet it leaves me the reverence of lawfull authority. And to this purpoſe (that I may change the tenour of my diſcourſe) I muſt tell you that I am very well pleaſed with my Voyage, and do not repent me to have performed a ſmall complement, which hath diſcovered unto me an eminent virtue. I have ſtudied M. <hi>de Braſſac</hi> now eight days together, I have obſerved him in publick &amp; in private; I have ſeen him handle dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſubjects, with ſo equal force, that I am even aſhamed, that having ſo perfect knowledge of his own Art, yet he knows mine much better than my ſelf. He is none of theſe limited wits that count themſelves full, if they have but three words of Latine, &amp; have but read one of Plutarks lives: Take them out of certain common places, within which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench themſelves, and draw all diſcourſe thither, every where elſe they are utterly diſarmed and without defence; but his knowledge is ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, &amp; comprehends ſuch an infinite number of things, that one cannot touch upon any point where he is not ready for you; and to draw him dry, I do not think there are queſtions enow in the World to put unto him. In one day I have heard him diſcourſe with Gentlemen about hunting and huſbandry; with Jeſuites about Divinity, and the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; with Doctors of leſs auſtere profeſſion about Rhetorick &amp; Poetry, without ever borrowing a forraign term, where the natural were the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and without ever flying to authority where the caſe in queſtion were to be decided by reaſon. To anſwer a premeditated oration from point to point upon the ſuddain, &amp; to ſend back our oratours more perſwaded by his eloquence than ſatisfied with their own, this I have ſeen him of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes do, and no man ever came to viſit him, whoſe heart he did not win with his words, or at leaſt left in it ſuch an impreſſion as is wont to be the firſt elementing &amp; foundation of love. No liberty can be ſo ſweet as ſo reaſonable a ſubjection; ſuch a yoak is more to be valued than the Mayor of <hi>Rochels</hi> Halberds; and when one is once aſſured of the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of his guide, it is afterwards but a pleaſure to be led. In leſs than one week he hath new made all ſpirits here; hath fortified the weak, hath cleared the ſcrupulous, and hath given to all the world a good opinion of the preſent, and a better hope of the time to come. I vow unto you I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

ſaw a man that had a more pleaſing way of commanding, nor better knew how to temper force &amp; perſwaſion together. I have indeed known ſome not unfit to command, but rather in a Galley than in a Citie, ſuch might ſerve for excellent Galley Officers, but are never good to make Governours; they underſtand not the Art of governing Freemen; there are even ſome beaſts of ſo generous a diſpoſition, that theſe men would be too rude to carry a hard hand over them; they would curb them with a Bridle and a Cavaſſon; whom they might lead in a garter. They think that power cannot ſubſiſt but by ſeverity, and that it grows weak and ſcorned, if it be not frightfull and injurious. This method and manner of governing is not like to come from the ſchool and diſcipline of <hi>M.</hi> the Cardinal, from whom nothing is ever ſeen to come that reliſheth not of the mildneſs of his countenance, and receiveth not ſome impreſſion from the clearneſs of his eyes. All that have the honour to come near about him are known by this Character, &amp; wear all the ſame livery, though they be of different deſerving. There is not ſo ſullen an humoriſt that is not mollified by his preſence, nor ſo dull an underſtanding that he makes not pregnant with a word of his mouth, this you know, &amp; I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of; he makes powerfull uſe of weak inſtruments, and his inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons lift up ſpirits to ſuch a height as their own nature could never car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them. He needs in a man but a ſmall ſeed of reaſon to draw from him exceeding effects of prudence, and he inſtructs ſo effectually the groſſeſt ſpirits; that what they want in themſelves, they get by his inſtructions. Theſe are works which none can do but he; materials which none but he can put in frame; yet I think I may ſay without offence, that this is more of his choiſe than of his making. To ſpirits that languiſhed for want of room to ſtir themſelves in, he hath given ſcope and imployment, and where he hath found a virtue neglected, to make it as bright as it was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid; he hath not forborn to crown it with his friendſhip. There is not a mouth in all this Province that bleſſeth not his Election; and every man believes to have received from him that power, which he hath procured to him, who will not uſe it but for our good. Amongſt the ſhowts of exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which wait upon him in all places where he goes; the joy of the people is not ſo fixed upon preſent objects, but that it mounts to a higher cauſe, and gives thanks to the firſt moover of the good influences, which the lower heavens pour down upon us. And in effect if <hi>Ceſar</hi> thought he took a ſufficient revenge of the <hi>Africans,</hi> for their taking part with the enemy, by placing <hi>Saluſt</hi> to be their Governour; who did them more hurt by his private family, than a Conqueror would have done with all his Army; by the contrary reaſon we may gather that the true Father of his Countrey hath had a ſpecial care of us in advancing M. <hi>de B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And what can you write in the general of affairs, that hath not relation to one of theſe points?

I have had
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:120345:96"/>
heretofore ſome pretentions to Church preferments, but now they are all reduced to this one preferment of being a good Chriſtian; and ſo long as they caſt not upon <hi>Balzac</hi> the term of an Apoſtata for the reſt, I am well content with my preſent condition; and certainly deſires ſo moderate, cannot chuſe but be ſuccesfull, and I will never believe that ill fortune any more than good will ſeek after me ſo far as this; or that it is poſſible for him to fall that ſtands ſo low; yet if any Devil, enemy of my advancement ſhould envy my retiring; and if any promoter ſhould lay to my charge, that to get out off —. I would corrupt —, I make my ſelf this promiſe Sir, that you will ſtand ſtrongly in defence of your innocent friend, and that in ſo juſt a protection you will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark alſo that excellent perſonage, of whom you ſpeak in your Letter. I am, as you know, unhappy enough not to know her, but ſeeing the honeſt men of <hi>Greece</hi> have uſed to adore upon adventure, and built Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars to unknown Deities, it may as well be lawfull for me to uſe devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this Saint upon the credit of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> who have now theſe three years looked upon her, as upon one of the true Originals, whereof they revere the Statues; they all agree in this, that ſince the <hi>Porciaes</hi> and the <hi>Corneliaes</hi> there never was any thing ſeen comparable to this; and that thoſe divine women, which were the domeſtical Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of their huſbands, and the rivals of their virtue, have no other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over this <hi>French Lady,</hi> but that they died in an age of funeral Orations. You ſend me word that you finde her in the ſame eſtate you left her, and that ſhe is now as freſh and amiable as ever ſhe was, and I eaſily believe it; this long continued ſtate of youth is no doubt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of her extraordinary virtue: the calm within ſweetens and clears the Air without; and from the obedient paſſions of her minde, there riſeth neither winde nor cloud to taint the pureneſs of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. As there are certain temperate Climates, which bring forth Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes all the year long; and where it is counted for a wonder, that ſuch a day it was cold, or ſnowed: ſo are there likewiſe certain faces privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, preſerved to the end of old age, in the happy eſtate of their infancy, and never loſe the firſt bloſſoming of their beauty. But it is not for a man buried in the darkneſs of a Deſart, to talk of the moſt illuſtrious matter that is in the World: it befits me rather to read that over again which you have written, than to add any thing to it, and for fear leaſt any word ſhould ſcape from me that is not Courtly, and which may marre all I have ſaid already, without further diſcourſe, I aſſure you that I am</p>

                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I Take great joy to hear you harken after me, and that you need no remembrancer to put you in minde to be mindefull of me. This thought of yours is ſo much the more dear unto me, becauſe it comes from a heart that hath none vain or caſual, but makes choiſe of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects it beholds, and of the Images it receives: to be thought of by you, is to be worthy of being thought of. This ought to be the ambition of men that are worth ought; and a virtue that is not approved of you, ſhews there is ſomething in that is defective. If then I have this mark, I have the ſeal and confirmation of the true good: I have both the good fortunes, that of virtue, and that of your favour; and herein at leaſt I have ſome reſemblance of an honeſt man. There are ſome whom blinde chance hath lifted up above you, of whom I cannot ſpeak in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: one may ſet their blame and their praiſe in equal degree of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency, and there is no Obligation to follow them in their opinions, but when they get it by conſtraint, or elſe by purchaſe. All their greatneſs is in their Titles; there ſcarce appears upon them one little beam of it in dayes of Ceremony; and if they will have us to reſpect them, they muſt be fain to ſend a Herauld to put us in minde. For you Sir, it is not onely upon the Bench that the World reveres you, but your authority follows you whereſoever you are; ſhe accompanies you even in your ordinary converſation: you cannot ſo diſguiſe your ſelf, but that I ſhall alwayes take you for my Judge; and this gravity of your countenance, which changes every word you ſpeak into a Decree, and gives a dignity to your very ſilence, may ſerve to verifie that Paradox of the <hi>Stoikes,</hi> That a wiſe man can never be a private perſon; and that Nature her ſelf makes him a Magiſtrate. Mounſieur <hi>Coeffeteat</hi> and my ſelf, have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten had long diſcourſes about this point, and it is not as we would have it, and as we wiſh, that a man ſhould be left at the bottom of the ſtairs, whoſe merit we ſee aſcended to the top; but this is the deſtiny of the beſt things; either they are wholly neglected, or at moſt but half known: and I have ſeen in the ſame place a Munkey ſet upon the top of a <hi>Pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi> and a Maſter piece of <hi>Phydias</hi> ſuffered to ſtand upon a very mean Baſe; but the ſatisfaction of your conſcience, and the teſtimony of your good report ought to be your comfort for all ſuch events. There are illuſtrious lives of divers faſhions; but thoſe like yours, which caſt a ſweet and pleaſing light, pleaſe me much better than thoſe that thunder
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:120345:97"/>
and lighten. It is not the noiſe and the flaſhes that make the fair dayes, it is a calm and clear air; and a life led in tranquility and judgement, which is the work of reaſon; is preferrable before one half or the great ſucceſs, the World admires, which are but the extravagancies of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. See here the decree of a Countrey Philoſopher, and matter of meditation for one of your walks at <hi>Yſſy.</hi> To tell you true, I have a great longing to come upon you one day on the ſudden, and to ſurprize you in ſome of your conferences; but it ſhall be then with a purpoſe to return as ſoon as I have ſeen you, without ſo much as ſeeing <hi>Paris;</hi> to make you thereby ſee, I can wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such a bravery would be an affront, and ſubject to interpretation I ſuppoſe; yet I am aſſured that thoſe, who are not diſeaſed with opinion, and infected with cuſtom, would make no ill cenſure of it, and it little concerns me, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people condemn me; if you, and thoſe other good men do juſtifie me, and believe that I am</p>

                     <p>EXpect not from me a regular anſwer to your Letters; for beſides that I yield an abſolute aſſent to all they contain, and that in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with you, I deſire rather to believe than diſpute, and to be found faithfull rather than reaſonable, I ſhould do wrong to the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I owe unto you, to make you ſee it, in the penſiveneſs I am now in, and to diſluſtre ſo pure a matter with the impreſſion of ſo black a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour. I therefore reſerve it for fairer dayes: when my minde ſhall enjoy its former ſerenity; and that I ſhall poſſeſs it without diſtraction. At that time I continue my ill occupation, and after I have made a Prince, it comes in my fancie to make a friend: you I aſſure you, muſt be the man I ſhall ſet before mine eyes; and ſhall not ſeek a more illuſtrious Original, nor a more remote: yet it grieves me Sir, that ſhould love with ſo little ſucceſs: it is not reaſonable you ſhould weary your ſelf in a ſoyl that will bear nothing, and that you ſhould take pleaſure to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy your huſbandry in tilling of ſtones and thorns; you can never dive to the bottom of my ill fortune; you are, I deny not, a powerfull agent, but it muſt be upon an apt ſubject; your induſtry is great, but Art corrects not deſtiny; and I am aſhamed to ſee, that all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdom ſhould be unprofitablely imployed in governing of me,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:120345:98"/>
when whole common-wealths are governed ſometimes with leſs adoe. A whole Fleet would not put you to ſo much labour as doth one poor Bark; and to ſuccour one particular perſon, you muſt enter combate againſt Heaven and Earth. It is better Sir, that this perpetual Object of ſcandal be removed by my abſence; and that I leave peace to my friends by leaving the field to my adverſaries. This reſolution is not ſo unmanly as ſome would point it out unto me, change onely the terms; and that which they call cowardly and running away, is but to be better adviſed and to yield to the time. I have read a word in a Letter, which <hi>Cicero</hi> writ to <hi>Brutus,</hi> that confirms me much in this opinion; <hi>You with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew your ſelf, ſaith he, out of a corrupted Citie, you gave place to Varlets; for you</hi> Stoickes <hi>ſay, That a wiſe man never runs away. Cato</hi> himſelf, who would rather die, than live to ſee a Tyranny; was he not reſolved to go voluntarily into baniſhment for avoiding a more ſupportable evil? And think you, that he had more reaſon to love his liberty, than I to love my quiet? Or that his grief was more juſt than mine? As all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtences are not honeſt, ſo neither are all flights ſhamefull; and as there are ſome naughty joyes, ſo there are ſome reaſonable griefs; and you ſhall ſee in the Paraphraſe of our friend, that for a diſgrace which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> received at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> his heart failed him, and he grew weary of his life. The authority of ſo great an example, bindes you to pardon in me, the weakneſſes you charge me with: For my ſelf, me thinks I hear continually ſounding in my ears, the voice that cried to <hi>Arſenius, Fuge, ſede, Tace;</hi> which ſeems to counſel me, to give my ſelf ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by my quiet, and to give others contentment by abſenting my ſelf, and by my ſilence. Some further reaſons I will acquaint you with, when I ſhall have the honour to ſee you; having no meaning to do any thing without your liking, and without your leave; whoſe I am</p>

                     <p>MY dear Couſin, we were put in hope we ſhould have the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſee you in this Countrey, and that here you would make one of the repoſes of your voyage, but you have not been pleaſed to make us ſo happy; It ſeems you thought not our walks pleaſant enough
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:120345:98"/>
for you; you ſcorn now the Fountains of <hi>Maillou,</hi> and the River of <hi>Balzac;</hi> theſe ſweet Objects, which heretofore gained your inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and enchanted the innocency of your tender years, are not now able to excite in you the leaſt deſire, not ſo much as to tempt your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver age. I finde in this ſomething to be offended at, and whereof to complain. If you had to do with a Poet, he would make a mighty quarrel between you and the Deities of the Woods and Waters; and would ſend you moſt reproachfull Elegies in behalf of the Nymphes, whom you have ſcorned. But it makes well for you that I underſtand not the language of the Gods, and that I can ſpeak no otherwiſe than the common people do: this will defend you from a number of naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Verſes: and I will ſay nothing to you more ſpightfull than this, that you ſeem to reſerve your ſelf all for <hi>Paris,</hi> and fear to be prophaned with the baſeneſs of a Village. Princes and their affairs leave not in you ſo much as one poor thought for us; and the pleaſures of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey are too groſs and meager for a taſte that is uſed to more delicate and ſolid pleaſures. You ſee Sir, my dear Couſin, that my complaints are ſweet, and that I juſtifie you in accuſing you. It is certain, there is a part of the active life, which one may call delightfull; and though Virtue have her joy with leſs tumult than Vice, yet the very ſecrecy of her joy augmenteth alſo the ſweetneſs, and vapours not out the purity thereof; and ſo it happens, that while you ſought but after honeſty, you have found withall delight alſo: you dreamed but of being virtuous and profitable to your Countrey, and into the bargain, you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment alſo and pleaſure for your ſelf. For in effect conſidering your humour, I doubt not but the pains you take, is your ſufficient recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the pains you take, and that your very action keeps you in breath; or rather refreſheth you; and as one in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid, That it was a death to him, when he was not in ſome office; ſo I verily believe, that to take away imployments from you, were as much as to take away your life, and that you would refuſe even felicity it ſelf, if it were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered you without having ſomething to do. You do well to love a burden that graceth you more than it weighs, and not to think it a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be in a race, which you have entered with as much applauſe as they can deſire that are going out. You have been mens joy, from the inſtant you were firſt ſeen, and your many imployments that have ſince ſo happily ſucceeded, have but ratified the good opinion that was had of you being yet unknown. There are ſome men that get more reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by playing upon advantage; but yours is a lawfull acqueſt, and this integrity, which hath nothing in it, either fierce or fearfull, this learning, which is neither clowniſh nor quarrelſom, this courſe, which can avoid Precipices without turning out of the right way, are none of the qualities with which men uſe to abuſe the World, none of the enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:120345:99"/>
which you make uſe of to dazle our eyes. And though our eyes were not capable of illuſion, yet having merited the grace and favour of a Prince, the cleareſt ſighted the Heavens ever made, and whoſe gift I value leſs than his judgement: It is not for us any longer to examin your ſufficiency; ſeeing he hath choſen you for an inſtrument of mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his affairs. You would not believe the pleaſures that Madam <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnole</hi> and my ſelf take in the conſideration of this matter; and what reflection we receive of all thoſe good ſucceſſes that accrew unto you; I can aſſure you, ſhe forgets you not in her devotions, and if God but hear her prayers, you need not make any wiſhes for your ſelf; We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed our ſelves we ſhould ſee you in our deſarts, but ſince your honour calls you otherwere; it is reaſon we reſt ſatisfied with ſo ſweet a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and to hear with patience that the publick hath need of your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. It is far from me to prefer a ſhort ſatisfaction of my eyes before the long and dureable joyes I expect from the progreſs of your repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and if I ſhould deſire that for your coming hither you ſhould put your ſelf the farther off from your ends, my deſires ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet, and I ſhould not be the man I ought to be.</p>

                     <p>MY dear Coſin, if the counſel I have given you did not give an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the reſolution you have taken, yet I could not chuſe but acknowledge it to be good, conſidering the good ſucceſs it hath produced. It is true that till now I never liked of long deliberations, nor of ſtaid lovers; but ſeeing your wiſdom hath concluded in favour of your love, and that it is no longer an idle contemplation of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon you love; I ſeem to conceive the deſign you had in drawing out the lines of your love to ſuch a length; in which it cannot be ſaid there hath been time loſt; but that you would taſte all the ſweetneſs of hope before you would come to that of poſſeſſion; this is not to be irreſolute but ſubtill, and not to make a ſtop of contentments but to huſband them. This is not to have an apprehenſion of being happy, but to have a deſire to be happy twice, ſo that in this point you are fully juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. This circumſpection, which I accuſed wrongfully, and which is equally removed from Fury and Effeminateneſs, puts the paſſions into a juſt and dureable temper, and makes the minde capable of its felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:120345:99"/>
by a ſerious preparation; and I vow unto you that the life you have begun was well worthy you ſhould take ſome time to ſtudy it; It is not fit to enter the ſtate of marriage raſhly, and by the conduct of Fortune; all the eyes, that prudence hath are not too many to ſerve for a guide in this buſineſs; many men fall into a ſnare whileſt they think to finde a treaſure, and errours are their mortal where repentance is unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but God be thanked you are out of danger, and your happineſs is in ſanctuary. There is no <hi>Nectar</hi> nor Roſes now but for you; (accept from me I pray this one word of a wedding Complement) and in the eſtate you are in, what are you not? Since a Conquerour that is crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is but the figure of a lover that injoyes; the lover receiving that really which the Conquerour but dreams. You offend not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples eyes with proud inſcriptions, nor aſtoniſh them with the clamour of your conqueſt; you celebrate your triumphs covertly, and draw no mans envy upon you; you raign by your ſelf alone, and all the pomp, which greatneſs draws after it, is not comparable to that which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in ſecret. I am not acquainted with lawfull pleaſures, and ought not to be with forbidden; but I have heard it ſaid, that in the firſt there is a certain peace of ſpirit, and a confident contentment which is not found in the other: And as the Honey is leſs gathered from the flowers then from the dew which falls from the Stars; ſo theſe chaſte plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are ſeaſoned from Heaven, and receive their perfection from the heavenly grace, and not from their own nature. I have learned from the ancient Sages, that there is not a more ancient nor a more excellent friendſhip than this; that in this ſweet ſociety griefs are divided, and joyes doubled, and that a good wife is a <hi>Catholicon,</hi> or univerſal remedy for all the evils that happen in life. I doubt not but ſhe, whom you have choſen, is worthy of this name, and though I ſhould hold your te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony in ſuſpition, yet I have heard it depoſed with ſo great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage on her part, and by ſo tender and judicious ſpirits, that I am not onely glad in your behalf for the good company you have gotten you, but give you thanks alſo in my own behalf for the good alliance you have brought me. I am exceeding impatient till I ſee her, that I may between her hands abjure my wrong opinions; and if need be, make honourable amends before her for all the blaſphemies I have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore written againſt marriage. I ſolemnly by this Letter ingage my ſelf to do it, and intreat you to diſpoſe her, that ſhe may accept my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, which proceed from a heart truely penitent and full of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to teſtifie to you both, that I am</p>

                     <p>YOur Letter hath run great hazards before it arrived here; It wandred about ſeven moneths together, and that now at laſt it is come to my hands; I aſcribe it to the remorſe of a man unknown, who being but half wicked, contented himſelf onely with opening it, but would not by any means that I ſhould loſe it. Happy were I if I could as well recover other things I grieve for, and that I could ſay, he were but ſtrayed whom I loved with my heart; but I have loſt him for ever, and you are never able to reſtore me that I lent you; yet I lay it not to your charge, nor to the charge of your innocent Countrey. I am not of that mans humour, who ſpake a thouſand villanies againſt poor <hi>Troy,</hi> and taxed all her Hiſtories and Fables, becauſe (forſooth) his brother died there, and perhaps of a malady that he hath gotten ſomewhere elſe. My grief is wiſer than his, I ſhould take my loſs unkindely at your hands, if you were your ſelf the richer for it, but now the loſs is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to us both; we both lament a common friend, and your ſelf have rather the greater ſhare in this ſad ſociety, in as much as herein you have advantage over me, for having performed to him the laſt duties. He ſaw your tears fall amongſt his bloud, you filled your eyes and your ſpirit with all circumſtances of his death, and I doubt not but it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred you from being perfectly ſenſible of the victory at <hi>Maſtrich,</hi> and from ſhewing a joyfull countenance in the moſt joyfull day of all your Princes life. For my ſelf, I am not as yet capable of conſolation, and I have plucked off from my wound all the plaſters Philoſophy could lay upon it. Me thinks my grief is to me in place of my friend; I poſſeſs it with a kinde of ſweetneſs, and am ſo tender of it, that I ſhould think it a ſecond loſs, if I had it not to paſs my time withall; yet I muſt intreat it a little forbearance, that I may have time to make you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of your liberality, and that you may know what is become of the preſents you ſent me; I received them Sir, after your Letter, and that by another kinde of adventure. I have imparted them to the worthieſt perſons of our Province, I am at this time adorning my Cloſet with them, and make more reckoning of them than of all the riches your Havens can ſhew, or then all the precious rarities the Sea brings to you from the fartheſt parts of the Earth. There is as much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your friends ſtile, and that of other Panegyriſts, as between the ſtoutneſs of a Souldier and the coyneſs of a Curteſan. This manly

Every part pleaſed me, but that of the <hi>Chorus's</hi> even raviſhed me, and becauſe I ſigh alwayes after <hi>Italy,</hi> that <hi>Chorus</hi> of the Romane Souldiers put me in paſſion; I finde my ſelf touched with it at the very quick, and in all company where I come, I cannot forbear crying out, as if I were in rapture with divine fury: <hi>O laeta otia Formiae; Lucrini O tepidi lacus, Baiorum O medii dies; O ſolae Elyſiis aemula vallibus: Laſſi temperies Maris: Campani via littoris, lis Baccho ac Cereri vetus, &amp;c.</hi> I have onely one little ſcruple to propoſe unto you; I know not well why <hi>Tyſiphone</hi> is brought in with <hi>Mariamne,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Styx, Cocytus</hi> and <hi>Acheron;</hi> and I cannot conceive how it is poſſible a natural body ſhould be formed of two as differing pieces as are in my opinion, the Jewiſh Religion and the Heatheniſh. My doubt grows from my ignorance, and not from preſumption: I aſk, as deſirous to learn, and not to pick a quarrel, eſpecially with a man, who in ſuch Criticiſmes is a <hi>King,</hi> and whom I acknowledge for the true and lawfull ſucceſſor of the great <hi>Scaliger;</hi> I have read his two Tracts upon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre of <hi>Horace,</hi> which are indeed two Maſter-pieces; and I do not think, I ever ſaw together ſo much antiquity renued, ſo much reaſon diſplayed, ſo much ſubtilty fortified with ſo much force. He ſtands not dreaming upon a word of no difficulty, erecting as it were Trophees of like paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, after the faſhion of our Note-makers now adayes, who heap up places upon places, and bring nothing in their writings, but the crudity and indigeſtion of their reading. He handles Grammar like a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and makes books to be ſubject to reaſon; and the authority, which time hath given them to the principles, which truth hath eſtabliſhed; he hath diſcovered that <hi>Idea</hi> of art, which the beſt workmen never yet came near, and hath added that laſt perfection, which ſhews ſpots and impurity in the moſt elaborate writings. I have a great deſign Sir, to go make my ſelf an Artiſt under his diſcipline, and to be at once both your Courtier and his Schollar, I have thought upon this Voyage a year ſince; but I would fain your Wars would make paſſage for me the way I would go, and that there were nothing <hi>Spaniſh</hi> between <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> and the <hi>Hague.</hi> The ſanctity of Oratours and Poets is not reverenced over all the World, they bear no awe amongſt <hi>Barbarians;</hi> theſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick enemies would not ſpare <hi>Apollo</hi> himſelf, nor the Muſes, and my perſon would finde as little reſpect at their hands at my book did, which in full councel they cauſed to be burnt by the hands of the Marqueſs of <hi>Aytona,</hi> Yet I think you may ſay, you never heard ſpeak of a more illuſtrious Executioner, nor of one that doth more honour to his trade;

and that the Counts of <hi>Egmont</hi> and <hi>Horn</hi> were not handled in their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment with ſuch pomp and ſtate. I dare nor laugh, Sir, at this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant cruelty. The Truce I had taken is expired, and I cannot poſſibly ſtretch the leave, which my grief gave me any further. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leave you to return to her, and end with ſwearing, <hi>Per illos manes numina dolor is noſtri,</hi> that there is nothing in the World more dear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me than your friendſhip, and that I am with all my Soul,</p>

                     <p>MY dear Coſin, I never doubted of your affection towards me, but I thought it proceeded of pity rather than of merit; and that having nothing conſiderable in me, but my ill fortune; your good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was thereby onely excited to do me this charity; but now I ſee, you propoſe to your ſelf a more noble Object, and think to finde a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon for your loving me; yet I know not whether it be ſo juſt as the former, and whether you may as lawfully reſpect a vulgar perſon as you have protected an unfortunate. If I had had any ſuch ſeeds of goodneſs in me as you ſpeak of, my ill fortune would have ſtifled all their virtue. Nothing can bud forth in an air perpetually tempeſtuous. It is not enough for the labouring man that he take pains in his huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, and that his ſoyl be good, but there muſt be a ſweetneſs of the ſeaſon alſo to favour his travel: which I have hither to proved ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that I wonder how I have the heart to be alwayes planting for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts to ſpoil. I finde more good for me in idleneſs than in labour, and more gain by doing nothing, than by doing well. When I am idle, I am at leaſt at quiet; and envy reſts as well as I; but as ſoon as once I offer but to ſtir, there is preſently an alarum raiſed in the Latine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince: and oppoſition is made before I have conceived any thing to be oppoſed. Other mens good deeds are rewarded; mine onely, if any of mine be worthy the name, ſhould ſtand in need of a Pardon from the <hi>King:</hi> a very hard ſuite it would be, but to get their Pardon: and I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not virtue onely without reward, but I follow her with danger. You think notwithſtanding that I take a pleaſure in this ungratefull oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation; and that I have a greater forwardneſs to it, than I finde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. You think my ſpirit ſhould never ſhrink for ill ſucceſſes, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:120345:101"/>
that of its own fertilty without either one beam of the Sun, or one drop of dew, and at the mercy of all windes, it is able to bud and bring forth ſomething. You judge too favourably of a vigor that is half extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and conſider not, that melancholy indeed is ingenious and pregnant, when it comes from the temper, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> commendeth; but that it is dry and ſtupid when it proceeds from the continual out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of adverſe fortune. And therefore Sir, my dear Couſin, expect nothing from me to anſwer your expectation, and to merit the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you ſpeak of in your Letter, I cannot endure ſuch a great word in your mouth; are you not afraid to come under my office of a Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian? One ſuch improper term is unexcuſable, unleſs it be you had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to that old Verſe, <hi>Res est ſacra miſer;</hi> or to that brave fellow in the controverſies of <hi>Seneca,</hi> who in the life time of the Oratour <hi>Ceſtius,</hi> but upon the wane of his ſpirit, affirmed that he reverenced his very Cynders, and would uſe to ſwear by his ſhadow, and by his memory. It ſhall ſuffice me that you handle me in this manner, that Mounſieur your Preſident and your ſelf would ſometimes ſay in lamenting me, <hi>he had been further off than now he is, if he had met with fewer ambuſhes in his way.</hi> I require your recommendation of my ſervice to that rare perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, whom I dare not call the laſt of the <hi>French;</hi> I remember what was laid to <hi>Cremutius Cordus</hi> his charge; but how ever, I account him worthy of the ancient <hi>France,</hi> and of the Senate which we have not ſeen, that had the honour to be Arbitratour between the Emperour and the Pope; a mediator between the <hi>King</hi> and his people.

                     <p>THe account I make of you is far from being a miſtaking. One ſhould do you wrong to take you for any other than your ſelf; and it would be a hard matter to finde a man for whom you could be changed without loſs. I ſee therefore your drift, you would not think the number of your virtues compleat, if you added not humility, and you would make me ſee that there are Capuchine Huguenots. Indeed a fine novelty, but it belongs not to you, to be ſo modeſt; nor to take upon you perfection, who have not yet attained Converſion. To ſpeak uprightly, your reſpects and your ſubmiſſions are not ſufferable, men

uſed to ſpeak otherwiſe in the golden age; and to ſay nothing more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of you, you are too unjuſt a valuer of your ſelf. Do what you can, you are never any more able to weaken the Teſtimony, which Madam <hi>de Loges,</hi> and Mounſieur <hi>Chaplain</hi> have given of you, than you can deny me your friendſhip which I crave of you in their name. You ſee how conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious an ill example is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and how I imitate you in condemning you. I can play the reſerved as well as you, and ſeek for mediators and favour to obtain that favour you have granted me already. Theſe are the ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of my paſſion, to the end I may taſte a ſecond joy, I will make you tell me twice one thing; Moreover, at our firſt meeting, I will cauſe you to expound your Letter, thereby to huſband the better, yet for that time the pleaſure I take to hear you aſſure me that you love me. Such aſſurances ſhould perſwade me but little in the mouth of many men; but for you, I know with what Religion you make your promiſes, and of what holineſs your word is. I know you approve of no lies, but thoſe of the Muſes, and that fictions in Poetry you can bear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, but baniſh them from your converſation; I am glad therefore I have found one face among ſo many vyzards, and that I can lay hold of ſomething I can feel, and that hath truth in it. It is nothing but true hartedneſs of my minde that gives me the boldneſs to approach other virtues, with all which I am at defiance, if I finde not this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in their company. By this Sir, you have won me, and I muſt vow unto you, that this ſincerity whereof, you make profeſſion, hath been a wonderfull allurement to a man, that is no longer taken with the bravery, or gallantneſs of a fine ſpirit. Theſe flaſhes have ſo often abuſed me, that I am now grown to be afraid of any thing looks red, leaſt it ſhould be fire and burn me. I ſuſpect theſe Barks that are ſo painted and guilded over, I have often made ſhip-wrack in ſuch: I deſire thoſe that are ſound and ſafe, and enter them as Veſſels to ſayl in, and not as Galleries to walk in. When I ſpeak of a friend, I mean not a companion in trade, or in diſorder, nor one that can return viſits the next day after he hath received them, who never miſſeth to ſend Letters by every Poſt: and is not failing in the leaſt duties of a civile life, but I mean, a witneſs of the conſcience, a Phyſician of ſecret griefs, a moderatour in proſperity; and a guide in adverſity. I have ſome few left me of this ſort, but have had many loſſes, and very late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, which but for you would be irreparable; you whom God hath ſent to comfort me, and whom I ſubſtitute in the place of one of the honeſteſt men that was in <hi>France.</hi> Our contract, if you pleaſe, ſhall be ſhort and plain. I will propoſe no matter of luſtre to engage you in it; onely I aſſure you my heart, and a ſincerity anſwerable to yours. It is now of proof againſt the moſt dangerous air of Chriſtendom, I have brought it from <hi>Rome,</hi> I have preſerved it at <hi>Paris;</hi> It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                     <p>SInce you will have me to write that in a Letter, which I ſpake unto you by word of mouth, this Letter ſhall be a ſecond Teſtimony of the account I make of —, and of the feeling I have of the courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies received from him. During the time we had his company, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered him with much attention; but in my conſcience obſerved no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the motions of his ſpirit, but great inclinations to great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and to ſee him do wonders in the World, you need wiſh him no more but matter of imployment. He hath all the intendments of an honeſt man, all the Characters of a great Lord: by theſe he gains mens eyes in preſent, and their hearts in expectation, and afterwards brings more goodneſs forth than ever he promiſed, and exceeds expectation with performance. And in truth, if this Heroick countenance had no wares to vent but vulgar qualities, this had been a trick put upon us by nature, to deceive us by hanging out a falſe ſign. The charge he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth in the Church, is no burden to him, he hath in ſuch ſort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated his humour to it, that in the moſt painfull functions of ſo high a duty, there lies nothing upon his ſhoulders, but eaſe and delight. He embraceth generally all that he believes to be of the decency of his profeſſion, and is neither tainted with the heat, which accompanies the age wherein he is, nor with the vanity, which ſuch a birth as his doth commonly bring with it. In a word the way he takes goes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to <hi>Rome.</hi> He is in good grace with both the Courts, and the Pope would be as willing to receive the <hi>Kings</hi> commendation of him, as the <hi>King</hi> would be to give it. He hath brought from thence a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar approbation, and hath left behinde him in all the holy Colledges a moſt ſweet odour, and that without making faces; or making way to reputation by ſingularity. For in effect, what heat ſoever there be in his zeal, he never ſuffers it to blaze beyond cuſtom: his piety hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, either weak or ſimple, it is ſerious all and manly, and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſteth, it is much better to imitate S. <hi>Charls,</hi> than to counterfeit him. Concerning his paſſion of horſes, which he calls his malady; ſince he is not extream in it, never counſel him to cure it; it is not ſo bad as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:120345:103"/>
the Sciatica, or the Gout; and if he have no other diſeaſe but that, he hath not much to do for a Phyſician. One may love horſes inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, as well as Flowers and Pictures: and it is not the love of ſuch things, but the intemperate love that is the vice. Of all beaſts that have any commerce with men, there are none more noble nor better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and of them a great Lord may honeſtly and without diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be curious. He indeed might well be ſaid to be ſick of them, who cauſed mangers of Ivory to be made for them, and gave them full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of pieces of Gold; this was to be ſick of them, to beſtow the beſt office of his ſtate on the goodlieſt horſe of his ſtable; and to mock in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed reaſon it ſelf, and the ſpeech of men, to give them a neighing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul. You ſhall give me leave to tell you another ſtory to this purpoſe, not unpleaſant. It is of <hi>Theophylact,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who kept ordinarily two thouſand horſes, and fed them ſo daintily, that in ſtead of Barley and Oats, which to our horſes are a feaſt, he gave them Almonds, Dates, and Piſtach nuts; and more than this, as <hi>Cedrenus</hi> reports, he ſteep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them long time before in excellent Wine, and prepared them with all ſorts of precious odours. One day as he was ſolemnizing his Office in the Church of Saint <hi>Sophia,</hi> one came and told him in his ear, that his Mare <hi>Phorbante</hi> had foaled a Colt; with which he was ſo raviſhed, that inſtantly without having the patience to finiſh his ſervice, or to put off his Pontifical Robes, he left the myſteries in the midſt, and ran to his ſtable to ſee the good news he had heard, and after much joy expreſſed for ſo happy a birth, he at laſt returned to the Altar, and remembred himſelf of his duty, which the heat of his paſſion had made him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get. See Sir, what it is to dote upon horſes; but to take a pleaſure in them, and to take a care of them, this no doubt may make a man be ſaid to love them; and nevertheleſs not the leſs the wiſer man. Even Saints themſelves have had their pleaſures and their paſtimes; all their whole life was not one continued miracle; they were not every day 24. hours in extaſie: amidſt their Gifts, their Illuminations, their Raptures, their Viſions; they had alwayes ſome breathing time of humane delight, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all which time they were but like us: and the Eccleſiaſtical ſtory tells us, that the great Saint <hi>John,</hi> who hath delivered Divinity in ſo high a ſtrain, yet took a pleaſure, and made it his paſtime to play with a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, which he had made tame and familiar to him. I did not think to have gone ſo far; it is the ſubject that hath carried me away, and this happens very often to me when I fall into diſcourſe with you. My com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements are very ſhort, and with men that are indifferent to me, I am in a manner dumb; but with thoſe that are dear unto me, I neither obſerve Rule nor Meaſure; and I hope you doubt not, but that I am in the higheſt degree,</p>

                     <p>THere is no more any merit in being devout; Devotion is a thing ſo pleaſing in your book, that even prophane perſons finde a relliſh in it, and you have found out a way how to ſave mens Souls with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. I never found it ſo much as within this week, that you have fed me with the dainties of the ancient Church, and feaſted me with the <hi>Agapes</hi> of your Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> This man was not altogether unknown to me before, but I vow unto you, I knew him not before, but onely by ſight; though I had ſometimes been near unto him, yet I could never mark any more of him than his countenance and his outſide: your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe hath made me of his counſel, and given me a part in his ſecrets; and where I was before but one of the Hall, I am now one of the Cloſet, and ſee clearly and diſtinctly what I ſaw before but in Clouds, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhadows. You are to ſay true, an admirable Decipherer of Letters; in ſome paſſages to interpret your ſubtilty is a kinde of Divination; and all throughout, the manner of your expreſſing is a very charm. I am too proud to flatter you, but I am juſt enough to be a witneſs of the truth; and I vow unto you, it never perſwades me more than when it borrows your ſtile. There reflects from it a certain flaſh, which pleaſeth inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as beauty doth, and makes things to be lovely before one knows they are good. Your words are no way unworthy of your Authour; they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weaken his conceits by ſtretching them out at length, nor ſcatter the ſence by ſpreading it out in breadth. But contrariwiſe the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſpirit, which was ſtreightened within the bounds of a conciſe ſtile, ſeems to breath at eaſe in this new liberty, and to encreaſe it ſelf as much as it ſpreads it ſelf: he ſeems to paſs from his fetters into triumph, and to go forth of the priſons of <hi>Rome</hi> where <hi>Nero</hi> ſhut him up, to enter into a large Kingdom, into which you bring him with royal magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. There are ſome ſo curious palats, they cannot reliſh the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Son of God, and are ſo impudent as to accuſe the holy Scriptures of clowniſhneſs and Barbariſme, which made Mounſieur —, who died Archbiſhop of <hi>Benevent,</hi> that he durſt not ſay his Breviary, for fear to mar his good Latin by contagion of the bad, and leaſt he ſhould take ſome tincture of impurity that might corrupt his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. I will not ſpeak at this time what I conceive of his ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; onely I ſay that if in the vulgar Tranſlation there be Barbariſm, yet you have made it civil; and if our good <hi>Malherb</hi> ſhould come again into the World, he would finde nothing in your Paraphraſe that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:120345:104"/>
were not according to the ſtrictneſs of his rules, and the uſage of the Court whereof he ſpake ſo often. Some other time we will confer about the Preface, and the Letters I received, which I have in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner all by heart, but eſpecially I have culled out theſe dear words to print in my memory, and to comfort my ſpirits. <hi>A little patience will crown you, all their throws ſeem like thoſe of ſick men a little before they die, in which I think there is neither malice nor force, if you can but diſpiſe them, Prefer the better ſide before the greater, and the Cloſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Theater.

                     <p>I Will not raiſe to you the price of my tears, though I have ſhed them for you eight dayes together: I content my ſelf to tell you that I am now comforted; ſince the news of your death, it changed into tidings of your hurt; and that I am made aſſured, you may be quitted of it, for a little pain and a little patience. I know well that virtue is more happily imployed in well uſing honeſt pleaſures, than in patient bearing troubleſom croſſes; and that without an abſolute diſtemper in the taſte, one can never finde any ſweetneſs in pain; yet you ſhall confeſs unto me, that there is a kinde of contentment in being lamented; and though the joyes of the minde be not ſo ſenſible as thoſe of the body, yet they are more delicate and more ſubtill; at leaſt, you have come to know of what worth you are by the fear, which all honeſt men were in to loſe you, and that in a time when half the World is a burthen to the other; and every one reſerves his lamentation for his own miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; yet all in general have mourned for you, in ſuch ſort Sir, that you have had the pleaſure to hear your own Funeral Oration, and to enjoy the continuance of a happy life, after receiving the honours done to worthy men after death. If the War of <hi>Italy</hi> continue till Winter, I will come and learn from your own mouth, all the particulars of your adventures, and I ſhall then know if your Philoſophy have not been

                     </opener>
                     <p>I Had heard that before, which you ſent me word of by your foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and had rejoyced already, for the new Dignity of Mounſieur the Preſident <hi>Segnior.</hi> It ſeems you think he is made Lord Keeper of the Scales for none but for you, and that no Feaſt for the joy of it ſhould be kept any where, but at <hi>Cadillac.</hi> Within theſe four dayes you ſhall ſee it kept all the Countrey over; it is a favour the <hi>King</hi> hath done the whole Realm. It is not ſo much for the purity of the air, and for the fruitfulneſs of the earth, that we ought to call it a happy year, as for the election of worthy Magiſtrates. I therefore take a joy in this news, as I am a ſubject of the <hi>Kings;</hi> and this is the firſt Right I claim in it: but beyond this, I have a ſecond Right of rejoycing, in that I am inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed in the advancement of a modeſty, which I know; and make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be made happy, by the proſperity of him, of whoſe honeſty I am aſſured. I put not forth this laſt word, at adventure: I am ready to make it good againſt whoſoever ſhall think it raſh; and I know he hath preſervatives againſt all the poyſons of the Court; and a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that cannot be corrupted with all the bribes of Fortune. There is nothing of ſo high a price, for which he would be willing to leave his virtue: if he had lived in <hi>Neroes</hi> time, he had been a conſtant Martyr; but living now under a juſt Prince he will prove a profitable Officer. To preſerve a life, which is to continue but a few dayes, he would not obſcure that life, which ought to laſt in the memory of many ages: and the leaſt ſpot upon his honour, would be more inſupportable to him, than the effuſion of all his bloud. He knows that in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Juſtice, being the interpreter of God; he cannot work of himſelf; that this Divine Act ought to be a general Suſpenſion from all humane affections, and that in the exerciſe thereof, he is no longer at his liberty, to ſhew love, or hatred; revenge, or gentleneſs. He conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that he makes not law, but onely declares it; that he is a Miniſter,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:120345:105"/>
and not a Maſter of his Authority; and that the Soveraignty is in the Law, and not in himſelf. This is the reaſon why in every cauſe he cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, he bethinks himſelf of his own proper cauſe, which ſhall one day be cenſured; he ſo judgeth, as if Poſterity were to take a review of his judging; and as though the preſent time, were but ſubalternate to the future. Thus I have heard him to make his account; and from his principles I have drawn my concluſions; and in a conference I had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with him, he ſeemed to me a better man than I have ſet him forth. In ſuch ſort Sir, that I am not of a minde to contradict you; In your writing of him to me, you ſay nothing which is not of my knowledge; and in my writing of him to you, I do nothing but follow your conceits. Never fear that the common errours will deprave his ſpirit; he hath laid too ſure a foundation in the knowledge of truth; he is too ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the good Sect. Having often and ſeriouſly meditated on the condition of humane affairs, he values them juſt as much as they are worth, but he adds nothing by opinion; he hates neither riches nor au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; this were the peeviſh humour of the <hi>Cynicks,</hi> to hate a thing that in it ſelf is lovely; he makes uſe of them after the manner of the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy, and of the <hi>Lycaeum,</hi> which never thought them impediments to happineſs, but rather aids and furtherances to virtue. Or may we not ſay more probably that he hath drawn his doctrines from a Spring nearer hand; and that he hath not gone out of himſelf to finde out the trueſt wiſdom? He hath examples at home, which may ſerve him for <hi>Idaeas</hi> of perfection; and Sages in his own race, which are Artiſts of virtuous life. Whileſt he governs himſelf by their Rules, he may well paſs by all forraign doctrines; and having his deceaſed Uncle before his eyes; he need not care to have <hi>Socrates</hi> for a myrrour: <hi>Quippe malim unum Cato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem quam trecentos Socratas.</hi> The memory of this illuſtrious perſonage is in ſuch veneration through all <hi>France,</hi> and his name hath preſerved ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent an Odour in the prime Tribunal of Chriſtendom, that it is not now ſo much the name of a family, as it is the name even of integrity and conſtancy it ſelf. Remember the Epigram of that <hi>Grecian,</hi> whoſe Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript I ſhewed you; which ſaith, that in a place at <hi>Athens</hi> when one named <hi>Plutarch,</hi> there was an Echo anſwered Philoſophy, as taking the one for the other, &amp; making no difference between the two. By the like reaſon the Muſes might uſe the ſame figure, and act the like miracle, in favour of this new Pillar of juſtice. They never need to uſe reſervations, nor fear too deep engaging themſelves: whatſoever they lay forth before hand for his glory, ſhall all be allowed them again in the reckoning. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been bred up in their boſom, and being entred into their Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he will never ſuffer them to ſtand waiting and catch cold at his gate; nor that a <hi>Switzer</hi> ſhall keep them out from entring his baſe Court. They ſhall never have (I aſſure my ſelf) that unhappy advantage to have
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:120345:105"/>
given him all, and receive back nothing from him again; to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched his minde with a thouſand rare knowledges, and then hardly get him to ſeal them an acquittance. Let us now come to the other part of your Letter; and aſſay to ſatisfie your Doctour concerning his Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. He findes fault with me, becauſe I praiſe the Pope for his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſayes that ſuch praiſe is for women and youth, and belongs not to old men and Prieſts. Firſt, Sir I anſwer, he wrongs me in changing my terms; for I make a great difference between beauty and a good Viſage: of this I ſpake in the perſon of the Pope, and ſhould never have thought I had committed a ſin, though I had ſpoken of the other alſo. As concerning age, you know there are beautifull old men, though there be not beautifull old Women; and you remember that ancient perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, who by report of Hiſtory was of equal pleaſing to all companies through all the ages of his life. As concerning the quality, beſides that God rejected in ſacrifice all lean and unſound Oblation; he required al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to have handſome Prieſts; and you may ſhew your friend in the books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that not onely the lame and pore-blinde, but even the flat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed were excluded from being Miniſters in ſacrificing. But if being, as he is a prophane Doctour, the holy Scriptures do not pleaſe him; yet he might have remembred that old word of the <hi>Tragick</hi> Poet, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, upon which I had an eye when I ſaid, This Viſage worthy of an Empire. And yet more being a <hi>Gaſcogne</hi> Doctor, I wonder he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read the <hi>Panegyrick,</hi> which a Countrey man of his pronounced at <hi>Rome</hi> before the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius;</hi> where he ſhould have found theſe words; <hi>Auguſtiſſima quaeque ſpecies, plurimum creditur trahere de Coelo; ſive enim Divinus ille animus venturus in corpus, dignum prius me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reatur hoſpitium, ſive cum venerit fingit habitaculum pro habitu ſuo; ſive aliud ex alio creſcit; &amp; cum ſe pariajunxerunt, utraque majora ſunt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam Arcanum Coeleſte rimari; Tibi iſtud ſoli pateat imperator cum Deo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorte ſecretum. Illud dicam quod intellexiſſe hominem &amp; dixiſſe fas eſt; talem eſſe debere qui a gentibus adoratur cui toto orbe terrarum privaeta vel publica vota redduntur; a quo petit Navigaturus ſerenum, Peregrinatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus reditum, Pugnaturus auſpicium. Virtus tua meruit imperium, ſed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuti addidit forma ſuffragium. Illa praeſtitit ut oporteret te principem fieri; haec ut deceret.</hi> In this diſcourſe, there are ſome terms which yet may ſeem fitter for a Pope than for an Emperour: and here is to be noted, that <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was no young man, when <hi>Latinus Pacatus</hi> praiſed him thus for his beauty, for it was after his defeat of the Tyrant <hi>Maximus;</hi> and when after many victories obtained againſt the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> he was in full and peaceable poſſeſſion of his glory. Sometime before this; <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> had upbraided the Emperour <hi>Julian</hi> for his ill favoured Viſage, for the ill feature of his face, and for other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities of his body, of which nevertheleſs he was not guilty.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:120345:106"/>
Though one might here queſtion the holy Oratour, whether in doing this he did well, or no? Yet from hence we may at leaſt gather, that the qualities, contrary to theſe he blames, ought juſtly and may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made account of; and that ſuch praiſes, which reflect upon the Creatours glory, are much more Chriſtian than thoſe accuſations, which trench upon the ſcorning of his knowledge. Your friend therefore is certainly more ſevere than he need to be. He is much to blame to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in this ſort the bleſſings of Heaven, and the advantages of birth; and to imagine that holineſs cannot be examplar and Apoſtolick, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be pale and lean, and look like one were ſtarved. Theſe are the dreams of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who will have it, that our Saviour was in no ſort beautifull, and therein gives the lie to all Antiquity, and to the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole Church. He draws a Picture for him, which is not onely injurious to his Divine, but diſhonourable alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This in my opinion is one of his greateſt errours, and which moſt of all ſtartles me in reading his books. If he would have it, that his watchings and abſtinence had dried up his bloud, and made him look gaſtly; that to the burnt colour of <hi>Africk,</hi> he added alſo that of burnt Melancholy and of overflowing choler, it may perhaps be granted him; yet I will not accuſe, either the Sun of his Countrey; or the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of his body: but leave every one in his natural eſtate; and ſo ſhould he have done. But to go about to disfigure the moſt beautifull amongſt the Children of men, and to eclipſe all the beams and luſtre of a Divine countenance, this is a ſullen humour, which no patience can bear with; no charity can ever pardon. You wondered at this ſtrange opinion when I laſt ſhewed it unto you; and I perceived you ſuſpected I did him wrong; now therefore to juſtifie my credit with you, and to let you ſee I did it not to abuſe you: I ſend you here the paſſages I promiſed you to look out. The firſt is in his book of Patience; where Chriſt is called <hi>Contumelioſus ſibi ipſi.</hi> The ſecond in his book againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> where he is ſaid to be, <hi>Ne aſpectu quidem honestus:</hi> but hear the third, which will fright you to hear, in his Tract of the fleſh of Chriſt: <hi>Adeo ut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>IT is told me from all parts that you ſpeak of me, as one that is dear unto you, and of my ill fortune, as of a thing that concerns you. If this tenderneſs proceed from a ſoft effeminate ſpirit, yet it would not be without merit; and oblige me infinitely unto you; but now that it comes from a feeling of the pureſt ſpirit in the World, and the leaſt capable of weakneſs; how much ought I to eſteem it, and of how great price to value it? It wants not much of making me love that grief which procures me ſo glorious a conſolation; and I vow unto you, that to be pittied of you, is a more pleaſing thing than to be favoured of the Court. In that Countrey men go upon ſnares and ruines; the beſt places there are ſo ſlippery that few can ſtand upright; and if the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pretenders avoid a ſudden falling, it is by enduring a tedious toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: receiving perpetual affronts, and returning perpetual ſubmiſſions. I therefore like much better to hide my ſelf here with your good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and my own good quiet, than to bear a ſhew there with their frights and ſour looks; and I bleſs the windes, and count my Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack happy which hath caſt me back upon my old home. Some that were more ſenſible than my ſelf, would in this caſe complain of the World; but I content my ſelf to forget it: I will neither have War, nor commerce with the world: I have ſounded a retreat to all my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; as well thoſe that be troubleſom, as thoſe that be pleaſing; and I proteſt unto you Sir, I ſhould read with more delight, a relation of one of your walks at <hi>Cadillac,</hi> than the moſt delightſom paſſage of all the <hi>German</hi> Hiſtory: when I think upon you in company with —, me thinks I ſee <hi>Laelius</hi> come to viſite <hi>Scipio,</hi> and confirming him in the reſolution he hath taken to ſtand aloof from the tumults and turbulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of worldly affairs; and by a quiet retreat to place his virtue, and his glory in a ſure hold. I am extreamly glad of the honour he will do my Father to paſs this way, and bring you along with him; and you may well think that after this I ſhall not reckon our Village inferiour to <hi>Tempe,</hi> or to <hi>Tyvoly.</hi> If it were not for the ſit of an Ague, which is now leaving me, but very quickly to return; I would go as far as <hi>Rochel</hi> to

                     <p>THough I know the good deſerts of — are not unknown unto you, and that you need no forraign commendation to increaſe your reſpects towards him, yet I cannot hold from doing a thing ſuperfluous; &amp; aſſure you by theſe few lines that it will be no blemiſh to your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to let him have your Teſtimony of his piety. Ever ſince the time he renounced his errour, he hath continued firm and ſtedfaſt in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine you taught him: of an erroneous Chriſtian you made him an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, and your hand is too happy to plant any thing that doth not proſper. He is therefore your workmanſhip in Chriſt Jeſus, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſo perfect a friend of mine, that I know not, if in the order of my affections, I ought not to ſet him in equal rank with my own brother. This at leaſt I know, that the leaſt of his buſineſſes is the greateſt of mine, and I will not onely part your ſavour between him and me, but will become your debtour for the whole my ſelf alone. I am now po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing thoſe writings which I had condemned, but that you aſked their pardon; and ſince it is your will they ſhould not periſh, I revoke my ſentence, and I am reſolved your ſelf ſhall be the other perſon of my Dialogue; after the example of that Roman you love ſo well, whoſe books of Philoſophy are commonly his conferences with <hi>Brutus,</hi> or other Sages, the true and natural judges of ſuch matters; yet Sir it is impoſſible for me to diſſemble any longer a grief I have at my heart, and to end my Letter without letting you ſee a little cut you have given me there; you made me a promiſe to come back by <hi>Balzac,</hi> and now you have taken another way: Thus the wiſe men of the Eaſt dealt with <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod;</hi> yet I am neither Tyrant nor enemy to the Son of God. This kinde of proceeding is far unlike the Belgick ſincerity, and it is not fit for Saints to mock poor ſinners.

                     <p>SInce you have taken pleaſure in obliging me, I will not have you have the grief to loſe your Obligation, nor that my incompetent acknowledgement ſhould make you have the leſs ſtomack for doing good. I know your goodneſs is clear and free from all forraign re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, and hath no motive but it ſelf; it is not at any mans prayers that the Sun riſeth; neither doth he ſhine the more for any mans thanks; your courteſies are of like condition: Your favours have not been procured by my making ſuit; and as of my part nothing hath gone before the kindeneſſes I have received, ſo on your part I aſſure my ſelf you expect not that any thing ſhould follow them; yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt be done for examples ſake; and not to give this colour for ſhewing little courteſie to ſuch as complain that men are ungratefull. The place where you are is full or ſuch people; all commerces are but Amuſements, and to make men believe the whole World is given to deceive; and it is a great merit in you that you can follow ſo forlorn and ſolitary a thing as truth is in a Countrey where Divines maintain her but weakly, and where ſhe dares ſcarce be ſeen in a Pulpit, doth it not ſhew an extraordinary courage to take upon him to diſtribute her amongſt the pretenders, and that in open Theater? It is no mean hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be good at the Court; to condemn falſe Maxims where they have made a Sect, and where they have gotten the force of Laws. I have been aſſured you make profeſſion of this difficult virtue, and that in the greateſt heat of calumny, and the coldeſt aſſiſtance that ever a poor innocent had, you have been paſſionately affected in my behalf, being altogether unknown unto you, but by the onely reputation of my ill fortune; and even at this preſent you are taking care of ſome affairs of mine, which I in a manner had abandoned; and upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port you heard of my negligence you make me offer of your pains and induſtry. The onely uſing your name were enough for all this; I might well ſpare my own unprofitable indeavours, where my negligence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing favoured by you, ſhall without all doubt be crowned. You have heard ſpeak of that <hi>Grecian,</hi> whom the love of Philoſophy made to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the tilling of his ground; and of whom <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaid that he was wiſe, but not prudent. He found a friend that ſupplied the defect of his own ill huſbandry, and repaired the ruins of his houſe. If my eſtate were like his, I ſhould expect from you the like favour; but I aſk not ſo much at this time. All that I deſire now, — hath promiſed me a

He is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſpired by any falſe Deity, nor hath made me any doubtfull an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; to that reſiſting my ſelf upon this foundation, there ſeems to have been a kinde of Religion in my negligence: and I am not altogether in ſo much blame, as — would make you think me. He is, I deny not, an Authour worthy to be credited; and his teſtimony ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; but yet he hath not the gift of not erring, and never believe him more, than when he aſſures you that I am</p>

                     <p>Since the time that perſecution hath broken out into flames againſt me, I never received more comfortable aſſiſtance than from your ſelf; and I account your ſtrength ſo great, that I cannot doubt of the goodneſs of a cauſe which you approve. You were bound by no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to declare your ſelf in my behalf, and you might have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Neutral with decency enough; but the nobleneſs of your minde hath paſſed over theſe petty rules of vulgar Prudence; and you could not endure to ſee an honeſt man oppreſſed, without taking him into your protection. This is to ſhew me too much favour in a Kingdom where Juſtice is no better than Mercenary, and where it is bought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long ſolliciting. I know well that the ſoundeſt part is of my ſide; and that my ſtate is not ill amongſt the wiſe; but on the other ſide, there are ſo many oppoſites on the By, that make War upon me; that I am ready to leave my ſelf to the mercy of the multitude, and to be perſwaded by the number of my enemies, that I am in the wrong. It is therefore no ſmall Obligation I am bound to you in, that you have preſerved the liberty of your judgement amidſt the alterations and factions of paſſionate men; and have taken the pains to clear a truth, which is to me of great advantage, and was to you of ſmall importance. I do not deſire that men ſhould count me learned: this quality hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten troubled the peace of the Church; and they are not the ignorant that make Schiſmes and Hereſies: And leſs I pretend to the art of well ſpeaking; many bad Citizens have uſed this as an inſtrument to ruin their Countrey; and a dumb wiſdom is much more worth than an ill minded eloquence.

                     <p>THat ſorrow is happy which hath you for a comforter. I finde more contentment in your paſſionating me, than I finde affiiction in others perſecuting me: and I am far from wiſhing ill to an age, to which I am beholding for ſo excellent a friend. In this reſpect I eaſily pardon it, the wrong you ſay it hath done me; and ſhould be more unjuſt than it ſelf is; if being beholding to it for a treaſure, I ſhould think much to partake of its iron and ruſt. It is not now onely that opinion go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the World; there hath been diſputing againſt reaſon in all ages. Contentions and Hereſies have ever been, and the truth it ſelf was not believed, when it came into the World in perſon, and would have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. I ſeek not the favour of the multitude, it is ſeldom gotten by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and lawfull means; and in that, Enchanters have had ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over Prophets. I ſeek the Teſtimony of few; I number not voices but weigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore never trouble your ſelf that things have befallen me as I made account they would, and never aſk for reaſon of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar who have it not. Ignorance can never be juſt, nor go right in the dark: Alarms are given, and ſurprizes are made by the favour of night: this is the time of Murthers and Robberies, ſhe the mother of dreams and phantaſms. Your ſelf have had your part in this experience as well as others. And at this very time I am talking with you, it may be you are accuſed by ſome for being a miſcreant, for not believing that Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> made prayers to God for <hi>Trajans</hi> Soul; or that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was ever a boſom friend of <hi>Seneca.</hi> It may be you are called <hi>Huguenot</hi> for doubting the infallibility of <hi>Philarchus,</hi> and denying ſome of his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. It may be you are charged with ſeeking in vain to perſwade a Maſter of Art, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had as much learning as <hi>Ramus;</hi> and that <hi>Ciceroes</hi> ſtile is as good as that of <hi>Lipſius.</hi> What ſhall I ſay more? It may be your dear and well beloved <hi>Martial</hi> puts you to more pains to

                     <p>MY dear Coſin, if I could with any honeſty leave the buſineſs I have in <hi>Angoumois:</hi> — ſhould not go into <hi>Languedoc</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me; and I would make this journey of purpoſe onely to have the happineſs to embrace you; you would know me preſently by the old yellowneſs of my face; and thereupon the force of bloud would draw along with it a little tenderneſs, and I do not believe but you would make a difference between your own and ſtrangers. The effects of grace deſtroy not the affections of nature; they onely take away that which is impure and earthly; and I aſſure my ſelf you do not love me leſs than you did, but that you love me in a better faſhion. I am told that the kinde of life you have choſen is not auſtere, but onely to your ſelf; and that your Thorns prick no body elſe; in truth, a devotion that pleaſeth me exceedingly, and I could never away with this ſtudied ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which diſguiſeth the hatred it bears to men, under pretence of the love of God. I am right glad you have taken the other way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we may now come ſafely to you, and never be afraid your virtue ſhould ſcratch us. Chriſtian Philoſophy hath nothing in common with the Cynick. This diſguiſeth, and that reformeth; one compoſeth the countenance, the other regulates the ſpirit; and indeed without an exact managing the ſuperiour part; all the pain that is taken about the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour is to no purpoſe without that, Mortification is not ſo good as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:120345:110"/>
Carnality; and if you do nothing but change your cloath of Gold for a ruſſet Coat; and your cut-work band for a demy collar, you ſhall no doubt be a loſer by the change. But the caſe is not ſo; you have left cares and trouble, for calmneſs and quiet; and you poſſeſs a happineſs which <hi>Kings</hi> can neither keep with themſelves, nor ſuffer amongſt their Neighbours; I ſpeak of peace, which in vain is expected from ther Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances and from their Leagues, being not to be obtained but onely of God, and who gives it not but to his friends. You are a happy man to be of that number, and you may believe me that I am not troubled about it, ſeeing there is good hope I may have a benefit by it my ſelf, and that your prayers may draw me after you; I doubt not but they are of great power and efficacy, and doubt as little that I am my ſelf of the number of thoſe you hold dear unto you; but as one that hath more need then any other, I conjure you to double them unto me, who am in heart and Soul</p>

                     <p>I Perceive that Mounſieur the great Maſter is a great extender of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and hath tied you to explain your ſelf in a matter whereof I never doubted. Herein he hath exceeded his Commiſſion, and done more than he had in charge to do. I ſeek no new aſſurance of your friendſhip; this were to ſhew a diſtruſt in the old, whereas the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion already laid, is ſuch that makes me forbear even ordinary duties, for fear I ſhould make ſhew to need them, and as if I would hold by any other ſtrength then your own inclination. Care and diligence, and aſſiduity are not alwayes the true marks of ſincere affections, which I ſpeak as well in your behalf as my own: Truth walks now adayes with a leſs train, men uſe not to make open profeſſion of it, but rather to confeſs it as a ſin: her enemies are ſtrong and open, her adherents weak and ſecret: yet Sir, if ſhe were in more diſgrace, and were driven out of <hi>France</hi> by Proclamation: I ſhould believe you would be her receiver, and to finde her out, I ſhould go directly to <hi>Pompone.</hi> I therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doubted of your love; this were to ſhew a diſtruſt of your word paſt to me: I marvelled that — knew nothing of it, and that you let
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:120345:110"/>
him take poſſeſſion of his government, without recommending unto him, your friends there. To ſatisfie my ſelf in this point; I ſaid in my minde, that certainly this proceeded from the great opinion you had of his juſtice; and that conceiving there would not be with him any place for grace or favour; you would not do me a ſuperfluous office. This is the interpretation I made of an omiſſion, which in appearance ſeemed to accuſe you; and this is the conjecture I made of your ſilence, before I came to know the cauſe. Now I ſee I was in the wrong, to imagine you had ſuch ſubtil conſiderations; or that you were reſtrained by ſuch a cowardly wiſedom which dares not aſſure the good to be good, leaſt ſuch aſſuring ſhould corrupt it. For my part I renounce a prudence that is ſo daſtardly and ſcrupulous, that fears to venture a word for a virtuous friend, becauſe this friend is a man, and may perhaps loſe his virtue. You do much better than ſo, and I am glad to finde you not ſo jealous of the glory of your judgement, but that you can be contented to be ſlighted and ſcorned, when it is for the benefit of a friend you love: let us leave flegm and coldneſs to old Senatours; and never make queſtion whether we ought to call them infirmities of age, or fruits of reaſon: There are good qualities for enabling men to judge of criminal cauſes, but are nothing worth for making men fit to live in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety: and he, of whom it was ſaid, that all he deſired, he deſired ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, ſeems to me a much honeſter man than thoſe that deſire ſo coldly; and are ſo indifferent in their deſires. If you were not one of theſe violent reaſonable men, and had not ſome of this good fire in your temper, I ſhould not have your approbation ſo good cheap. That which now galls you, would not at all touch you; and things which now deſcend to the bottom of your Soul, would paſs away lightly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes. I hear came yeſterday a man to ſee me, who is not ſo ſenſible of the pleaſures of the minde; and took great pitty of me and my Papers: he told me freely that of all knowledges which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſtudy, he made reckoning of none but ſuch onely as are neceſſary for life; and that he more valued the ſtile of the Chancery than that of <hi>Cicero;</hi> he more eſteemed the penning of a Chancery Bill, than the beſt penned Oration that ever <hi>Cicero</hi> writ. I thought this at firſt a ſtrange complement, but thinking well of it, I thought it better to ſeem to be of his opinion, then undertake to cure a man uncureable. I therefore anſwered him, that the Patriarch <hi>Calarigitone</hi> ſo famous for the peace of <hi>Vervins,</hi> was in a manner of his minde, who being returned from his Embaſſage, and aſked what rare and admirable things he had ſeen at <hi>Paris;</hi> made mention of none but their Cooks ſhops; ſaying to every body, as it were with exclamation <hi>Veramente quelle roſtiſſeries ſono Coſa ſtupenda;</hi> as much as to ſay that there are <hi>Barbarians</hi> elſewhere, then at <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco.</hi> One half of the World doth not ſo much as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe

I fear it will be long ere we ſhall ſee this Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion come forth; for my ſelf who make no ſuch reckoning of my Proſe; I have no purpoſe to make merchandiſe of it; yet deſire I not neither to tire my hands with writing continually to no profit.

                     <p>I Had a great longing to ſee — and you have done me a ſpecial kindeneſs to ſend it me over. Yet I muſt tell you, that your ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it gets him a greater reſpect with me then his own deſerving, and if you appoint me not to make ſome reckoning of him, all that I ſhall do for his own ſake, will be but to bear with him. A man had need be of ſanguine complexion, and in a merry vein before, that ſhould be moved to laugh at his poor jeſts. Melancholick men are too hard to be ſtirr'd; that which goes to the Centre of other mens hearts; ſtayes without doors in theirs; at leaſt it toucheth but very weakly the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; and oftentimes I am ſo ſadly diſpoſed and in ſo ſullen an humour, that if a jeaſter be not excellent, I cannot think him tolerable nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to hear him. It is certain the <hi>Italians</hi> are excellent in the art of jeſting, and I could mark you out a paſſage in <hi>Boccace</hi> that would have made — and all his predeceſſours the Stoick Philoſophers to forfeit their gravity. But there are not two <hi>Boccaces,</hi> nor two <hi>Arioſtoes;</hi> there are many that think themſelves pleaſant when they are indeed ridiculous; I would our good — would leave his wrangling about controverſies, and fall to this kinde of writing, in which in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he would prove<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> excellent. This would draw his Genius out of Fetters, and give it the extent of all humane things to play in; onely he ſhould ſpare the Church for her eldeſt Son ſake, and forbear the Pope for <hi>M.</hi> the Cardinals ſake, one of the Princes of his Court. Theſe are reſpects you ought to have, untill your converſion furniſh you with other more religious, and change this your honeſt civility

                     <p>I Am going to a place where in ſpeaking good of you I ſhall finde no contradiction, and where your virtue is ſo well known, that if I ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it but what I know, I am ſure I ſhall tell no news. I bring along with me the laſt Letter you writ unto me, and mean to be earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreated by Mounſieur — before I yield to grant him a Coppy. As for Madam — ſhe ſhould entertain an enemy upon this paſport, and though ſhe were reſolved to give me no audience, yet ſhe would never deny it to the reader of your writings. I know of what account you are in her heart, and how much I ought to fear, leaſt all the room there be taken up before hand with your favour. Yet ſuch opinion I have of her juſtice, that I willingly make her Arbitratour of our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and require her to tell whether ſhe think I have done wrong to — in deſiring him to give over his going to Law, and to paſs the reſt of his dayes in more quiet and ſweet imployments. The art of jeſting, whereof I ſpeak is no enemy to the art of morality whereof you ſpeak, rather it is the moſt ſubtle and moſt ancient way of retailing it; And that which would fright men, being uſed in the natural form, delights and wins them ſometimes, being uſed under a more pleaſing maſk. Men loath a wiſedom, that is drie and altogether raw; it muſt have a little ſeaſoning, ſuch a kinde of ſawce as <hi>Socrates</hi> was wont to make it; that <hi>Socrates,</hi> I ſay, whom all the Families of Philoſophers account their Founder, and acknowledge for their Patriarch. The ſtory ſayes he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſed to ſpeak in earneſt, and the age he lived in called him the ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. In <hi>Platoes</hi> book you ſhall finde little elſe of him but jeſting; with diſorderly perſons you ſhall ſee him counterfet a Lover, and a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, thereby to claw them whom he would take. He ſhuns the ſtile
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:120345:112"/>
of the Dogmatiſts, or to ſpeak definitively of things, as thinking it an inſtrument of Tyranny, and a yoak that oppreſſeth our liberty. In ſhort he handles ſerious matters ſo little ſeriouſly that he ſeems to think the ſhorteſt way to perſwade was to pleaſe; and that virtue had need of delight, to make way for her into the Soul. Since his time there have come men who contented not themſelves with laughing, but make profeſſion of nothing elſe, and have made it their recreation to play upon all the actions of humane life. Others have diſguiſed themſelves into Courtiers and Poets, and left their Dilemmaes and their Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmes to turn jeaſters, and to get audience in privy Chambers. We ſee then the World had not alwayes been ſad before <hi>Arioſto</hi> and <hi>Bernia</hi> came into it; they were not the men that brought it firſt to be merry; jeaſting is no new invention, it was the firſt trade that wiſe men uſed; who thereby made themſelves ſociable amongſt the people. <hi>Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thought it no diſparagement to Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, nor that there was in it any uncomelineſs unfit for his ſchool <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeum;</hi> he is excellent at deſcriptions, and counterfeitings, and his Characters are as ſo many Comedies, but that they be not divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Acts and Scenes, and that they repreſent but onely one perſon. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi> as ſolemne and of as ſullen humour as he was otherwiſe, yet once in his life would needs be merry, and hath left us that admirable <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theoſis</hi> of <hi>Claudius,</hi> which if it were loſt, I would with all my heart give one of his books <hi>de Beneficiis</hi> to recover again; and a much greater ranſom if it were poſſible to get it entire. No doubt but you have heard ſpeak of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> of the Emperour <hi>Julian;</hi> that is to ſay, of the ſports of a ſevere man, and of the mirth of a melancholick man. And from whence think you had the <hi>Menippaean</hi> Satyrs their names; Things ſo much eſteemed of by antiquity, and under which title the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Varro</hi> compriſed all wiſedom divine and humane, even from <hi>Menippus</hi> the Philoſopher, who was of a Sect ſo auſtere, and ſo great an enemy to vice, that <hi>Juſtus Lipſius</hi> doubts not to ſet it in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with the moſt ſtrict and reformed order of the Church. I am much deived but Madam — will not be found ſo ſcrupulous as you, but will give her voice in favour of an opinion authoriſed by ſo great examples. And indeed Sir, why ſhould you not like that our friend ſhould reſerve ſome mirth and ſome pleaſure for his old age? and having declaimed and diſputed abroad all day, ſhould come at night to have ſome merry talk in his own lodging; why ſhould you think it amiſs, that after ſo many wars and cumbats I ſhould counſel him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh himſelf with a more eaſie and leſs violent kinde of writing; and to afford us ſuch wares as may be received as well at <hi>Rome</hi> as at <hi>Geneva?</hi> Theſe thirty years he hath been a Fencer upon Paper, and hath furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all <hi>Europe</hi> with ſuch ſpectacles; why ſhould he not now give over a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:120345:112"/>
quarrel that he is never able to compoſe? He may in my opinion ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſay, <hi>it is enough,</hi> and content himſelf to have outlived his old ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, without ſtaying to look for new. Having had to do with Mounſieur <hi>Coeffeteau,</hi> and with Cardinal <hi>Perron;</hi> it would be a ſhame for him to meddle now with a dizzy headed father, or with the Antick of <hi>Roan;</hi> and a poor ambition it would be in my judgement to erect Trophies of two ſuch broken Bables; it were better he left <hi>individuals</hi> and fell to judge of <hi>ſpecies</hi> in general, and that he would conſider other mens follies without partaking of them. It were better to diſcredit vice by ſcorn, then to give it reputation by invectives, and to laugh with ſucceſs, then to put himſelf in Choler without profit. Though there be many ſorts of diſciplining men, and correcting their manners; yet I for my part am for this ſort; and finde nothing ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent as a Medicine that pleaſes. Many men fear more the bitterneſs of the potion that is given them, then the annoyance of the infirmity that offends them; we would fain go to health by a way of pleaſure, and he ſhould be a much abler man that could purge with <hi>Raſpices,</hi> then he that ſhould do it with <hi>Rhubarbe.</hi> Our Gentleman by — his leave is none of theſe; for commonly he neither inſtructs nor delights, he neither heals nor flatters their paſſions that read him; he hath neither inward treaſure nor outward pomp; and yet I can tell you, as beggarly and wretched as he is, he hath been robbed and ranſacked in <hi>France.</hi> He could not ſave himſelf from our Theeves; and you may ſee ſome of his ſpoils which I preſent you here.</p>

                     <p>SIR, I have received your Letter of the 27. of the laſt moneth; but it makes mention of a former which never came to my hands: and it muſt needs be that fortune hath robbed me of it, for fear I ſhould be too happy, and ſhould have two pleaſures in Sequence. This is an accident which I reckon amongſt my misfortunes; and I cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently complain of this Violatour of the Law of Nations, who hath been ſo cruel as to break our Commerce the very firſt day of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into it; and to make me poor without making himſelf rich. I am more troubled for this loſs, than for all that ſhall be ſaid, or written againſt me: Slander hath a goodly catch of it to be at war with me, it ſhall never make me yield; it is an evil: is it not a glory for a private man to be handled in ſuch manner, as Princes &amp; their Officers are? And is it not a mark of greatneſs to be hated of thoſe one doth not know? I never ſought after the applauſe of —, which cannot chuſe but have corrupt affections in ſuch ſort, that did they praiſe me, I ſhould aſk what fault I had done? Though their number were greater than you make it, this would be no great novelty to me, who know that truth goes ſeldom in the throng; and hath in all times been the Poſſeſſion but of a few. Even at this day, for one Chriſtian there are ſix Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans; and there was a time when <hi>Ingemuit orbis, &amp; ſe Arrianum eſſe miratus eſt.</hi> If God ſuffer men to be miſtaken in matters of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, where their ſalvation is at ſtake; why ſhould I expect he ſhould take care to illuminate them in my cauſe which no way concerns them; and to preſerve them from an errour which can do them no hurt? Whether I be learned, or ignorant; whether my eloquence be true, or falſe, whether my Pearls be Oriental, or but of <hi>Venice:</hi> what is all this to the Common-wealth? There is no cauſe the publick ſhould trouble it ſelf about ſo light a matter; and the fortunes of <hi>France</hi> depend not upon it. Let the <hi>Kings</hi> ſubjects believe what they liſt; let them enjoy the liberty of conſcience which the <hi>Kings</hi> Edicts allow them. A man muſt be very tender that can be wounded with words; and he muſt be in a very apt diſpoſition to die, that lets himſelf be killed by <hi>Philarchus;</hi> or <hi>Scioppius</hi> his Pen. For my ſelf I take not matters ſo to heart; nor am ſenſible in ſo high a degree. The good opinion of honeſt mindes, is to me a ſoveraign remedy againſt all the evils of this nature. I oppoſe a little choiſe number, againſt a tumultuary multitude, and count my ſelf ſtrong enough, having you on my ſide; and knowing you to be as vigorous a friend of mine, as I am</p>

You have been my defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour; and I have been a long time without knowing to whom I was bound for defending me: whether it were a man or an Angel that was come to my ſuccour. Theſe are honeſt ſubtelties, and generous ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerogations. This is to deceive in charity, and to his advantage that is deceived. This is to bring again that good time, wherein Knights un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known came to Freemen, that were oppreſſed, without telling their names; or ſo much as lifting up the Beavers of their Helmets. You have done in a manner the like; you have hidden your ſelf under a borrowed ſhape; thereby to take away from a good action, all appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of vain glory; and to let them that are intereſſed, ſee, that you are virtuous without looking for reward. For my ſelf, I do not think I am bound to follow the intention of this ſcrupulous virtue. If you have a will to ſhun noiſe, and the voice of the people; yet you cannot refuſe the acknowledgement of an honeſt man: nor let me from paying what I owe you. Becauſe you are modeſt, I muſt not therefore be ungratefull, as I am not by my good will, I aſſure you. You poſſeſs my heart, as abſolutely, as you have juſtly purchaſed it; I am yours by all the ſorts of right, not forgetting that of the wars.

From hence we may apprehend the dignity and merit of our Sorbon: for which a man the fulleſt of buſineſs in all the World, hath yet had ſo particular a care amidſt the moſt violent agitation of his thoughts, that the deſign of the houſe he erects for her, hath found place in his breaſt, amidſt the Forts and Rampires of <hi>Rochell.</hi> If our predeceſſors the <hi>Gaules</hi> next to their Gods, gave the ſecond place of honour to their <hi>Druides,</hi> who ſhewed them but a dim and confuſed light of the ſtate of our Souls after this life; what reſpect then, what reverence can be too great for thoſe venerable Fathers, who teach us by a knowledge moſt infallible; what the chief and ſupream good is; who diſcover to us in certainty, the things that are above the Heavens, who make us true relation of that admirable Common-wealth of happy Citizens that live without bodies, and are immaterial; and who deliver to us the wonders of the intellectual World, more pertinently and more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, than we relate to blinde men the ornaments of this viſible World. With them are had the ſprings of pure Doctrine; where with others, but onely Brooks and Streams; with them are had reſolutions of all doubts, remedies for all poiſons: with them time wrongs not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity; nor doth old age either need painting, or fear tainting: with them this ſixteenth age of the World, beholds Chriſtianity preſerved and kept in its firſt luſtre. Seing the memory of the moſt part of the <hi>Romane</hi> Lords is periſhed together with their Baths, their Aqueducts, their Races, their Amphitheaters; whereof the very ruins are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ruined and loſt; I finde that <hi>M.</hi> the Cardinal underſtands more than ever they did, and goes a ſtraighter way to eternity, travelling in a place where his travel can never periſh and leaving the care of his name to a company that of neceſſity ſhall be immortal, and ſhall ſpeak of his magnificence as long as there ſhall be ſpeaking of ſin and grace, of good and evil Angels of the pains and rewards of the life to come. I believe I have not ſpoken any further of it: and I think I could not have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:120345:115"/>
leſs: it is lawfull for us to ſet a price upon our own; and if an ancient Writer ſaid, that more worthy men came forth of <hi>Iſocrates</hi> School; than out of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe: why may not we ſay as much of <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> and of Saint <hi>Thomas?</hi> Me thinks I hear out Countrey men ſpeak of nothing elſe; but of the <hi>Lycaeum</hi> and of the Academy: and it is now five and twenty years that I have beaten my brains about the Gymnoſophiſts the Brachmanes and the Rabbins: but when all is done, we ſhould remember that we are Chriſtians; and that we have Philoſophers that are nearer to us, and ought to be dearer to us than all they. I am glad occaſion hath been offered me to put my opinion hereof in writing; and thereupon to let you know I make no myſtery of my writings; and eſpecially with you, to whom I have opened my very heart; and whoſe I am wholly without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F you had wholly miſliked my book, I had wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced it: but ſeeing ſome parts of it, ſeemed to you not unſound, I have thought it ſufficient to cut off the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt part, that you might be drawn to endure the reſt. I now therefore ſend you an Edition of it reformed, done expreſly for you, and which I have taken care to cleanſe from the ſtains, that in the two former were diſtaſtefull to you. It is not my purpoſe to ſtand diſputing in an Argument, where I am willing to be confuted: nor to defend that which is condemned by you, where the queſtion is to give you ſatisfaction by my rigour; I preſently grow inſenſible of the tenderneſs of a Father: and ſhall he uncompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate to my deareſt iſſues, as often as your pleaſure ſhall be that they ſhould periſh. My writings are to me no better than Monſters when they offend your eyes, and to ſeem vile to you, is to be vile indeed; and therefore in ſtead of aſking their pardon, I have been my ſelf the haſtner of their puniſhment. There cannot a greater teſtimony be given of a mans integrity, than when the Delinquent concurs in opinion with the judge; and is the Executioner, where he is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demner. All this have I already done; and although in that unhappy paſſage which gave you diſtaſte, I had not ſo much a meaning to bite as to laugh; yet I confeſs I took my mark amiſs for laughing juſtly. Oftentimes one countenance for another changeth the face of the moſt innocent action of the world: and though I failed onely in ill explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf; yet it was fault enough, ſeeing thereby I gave you cauſe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:120345:116"/>
to doubt of my intention. Truly, my Lord, it was never my meaning ſo much as to touch the reſplendent glory of your Divine Princeſs. I know well enough, it was fitter to conſider her by the magnanimity of her ſpirit; whereof your whole poſterity ſhall taſte the fruits, then by the light flower of bodily beauty; which not onely falls away by death; but runs away at the very firſt approaches of age. I ſhould come out of another World, if I were ignorant of the <hi>Encomiums</hi> ſhe hath in this kinde received by all peoples voices. She hath I know been ſtiled the Star of the North: the Goddeſs of the Sea; the true <hi>Thetis.</hi> I have read in a Letter, which <hi>Henry</hi> the great writ unto her in the height of all his troubles; and in the violence of the league: theſe words, <hi>I will Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam be your Captain General.</hi> Even he that excommunicated her, ſpake of her with honour: and he was, as you know, an underſtanding Prince, and admirable in the Art of ruling. He took a pleaſure to be diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of her with Embaſſadours reſident at his Court; and would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſay merily, that if he had been her huſband, certainly greatneſs and authority would have been the iſſues of ſo renowned a marriage. But though ſhe had not aſcended to this high degree of reputation, and though he ſhould be deveſted of all theſe glorious marks of honour, yet there are two conſiderations; leſs ſpecious indeed in the eyes of the World: but more ſenſible to my ſpirit, that would binde me ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reverence her memory: One Sir, that ſhe hath not ſcorned our Muſes; the other, that ſhe hath loved your houſe. I was taught by <hi>Cambden,</hi> the knowledge ſhe had in all kindes of learning; ſo far, as that ſhe had happily Tranſlated out of Greek into Latine ſome of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phocles</hi> Tragedies; and ſome of <hi>Iſocrates</hi> Orations. Of the ſame Authour alſo, I have learned the great part your Anceſtours bare in her confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and ſecrets; and your name is ſo often uſed in the hiſtory of her life, that where ſoever <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is mentioned, there <hi>Cicile</hi> for the moſt part is never left out. So that ſhe being by good right your domeſtical Deity, and the reverence you bear her, your moſt ancient inclination; it is far from me to violate that which you adore, or to hate that which you ſo dearly love; ſeeing I am</p>

                     <p>I Have never been ſociable ſince your departure from hence; no man can make me ſpeak; and I do not yet break my ſullen ſilence, but
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:120345:116"/>
onely to tell you, I am the ſaddeſt Hermite that ever was. Thoſe whom Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> reports to have been companions of Serpents and Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, were never of ſo untoward an humour as I; for I have their vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I have not their conſolation. Nothing pleaſeth me in the place where I am; you have carried away with you all its worth and goodneſs; and it is not the hardneſs of the ſeaſon, it is your abſence that obſcures the beauties of my ſolitude. It was not well done Sir to accuſtom me to a pleaſure which you meant ſo ſuddenly to take away from me, or to ſay better, to ſhew me onely my good fortune thereby to make me long after it; and then go preſently and make others hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py with enjoyning it; and yet I know well, that ſuch petty conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions owe obedience to a greater, and that particular intereſts ought alwayes to give place to publick. Mine therefore is not ſo dear unto me, but that I willingly forget it upon ſuch occaſions, and eaſily for go my own conceits, to enter upon the purpoſe of Divine providence. The peace we hope for ſhall perhaps by your voyage be advanced, and you are now perhaps ſent from Heaven to go whither you thought to have gone without commanding; If peradventure there be found ſome particular men that are too much heated, your <hi>Euſebius</hi> and your <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi> will help to allay their heat; and if they be too ſtifly bent upon ſeverity, you will make them abate their rigour by the examples you bring them, of the moderation of their fathers; I have too good an opinion of ſo many worthy Prelates as are in your aſſemblies, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they would ever agree to arm Princes, either againſt a penitent, or againſt an honeſt man, offended; and would not in the intereſts of their order content themſelves with imploying the Thunderbolts of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> without calling forth alſo thoſe of the <hi>Arſenal;</hi> Whatſoever may be ſaid in defence of ſuch proceeding, it can never in my opinion have ſo general approbation, but that ſome honeſt ſpirits will be ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized by it. This would be to bring excommunication into a poor account, to make it ſerve onely for an Eſſay, and for a preparative of puniſhment, and to make it the firſt plaſter of a light wound, which ought to be the laſt remedy of the extreameſt evils. Such practiſe would be far from the cuſtom of the ancient Chriſtianity, and of the age of Martyrs; and I cannot conceive, neither can it be, that Chriſtian Paſtors ſhould become Butchers of their Flock; and that the Church, which hitherto hath been in perſecution, ſhould now it ſelf begin to perſecute. This Church Sir, as your ſelf and the Gentlemen your brethren teach us, is not a cruel Stepdame, proud and maligning her ſpouſes Children; but it is a natural Mother, compaſſioning her own, and deſirous to adopt even Proſelites and ſtrangers: You tell us that ſhe runs after the greateſt ſinners, and goes as a guide before all the World, which is far from ſaying that it ſtands not with her dignity to be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:120345:117"/>
an inſtrument of their converſion, nor ſo much as once to take care what becomes of them; It is you who aſſure us that ſhe is content to loſe her richeſt Veſſels, ſo as thereby ſhe may gain to her the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious perſon who did ſteal them; it is from you we learn that ſhe is far from animating juſtice to ruin innocents, who gives ſanctuary of pardon to Delinquents. I have heard ſpeak of the ſweet nature and ſighing of the Dove; but never of her cruelty nor of her roaring; and to give her claws and teach her to love bloud, would be no leſs than to make her a Monſter; this would be Sir to make love it ſelf turn wilde, and Metamorphoſe it into hate. This would be to imitate the ancient Pagans, who attributed to their gods all the paſſions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of men; no man I hope ſhall be able to lay ſuch prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our charge, we will be no corrupters of the moſt excellent purity, no handlers of holy things with polluted hands, no ſtretchers of our defects to the higheſt point of perfection: They which do ſo, in what part of the World ſoever they be, are Anathemaes in your books, accurſed in your Sermons, condemned by the rules of your Doctrine, and by the examples of your life. Theſe falſe Saints do not ſerve Chriſt, but ſerve themſelves of Chriſt; they ſollicite their own affairs in his name, and recommend it as his cauſe when it is their own ſuit. Perſwaſion that they do well makes them more har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in doing ill; they call their choller zeal, and when they kill, they think they ſacrifice. Thanks be to God no part in the whole body of our Clergy is ſo unſound; it is returned to its Oyl, and to its Balm, in whoſe place the civil wars had ſubſtituted deadly Aconite and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Wormwood. The League is dead, and <hi>Spain</hi> heart-ſick; our Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are no longer inſpired by forraign Deities, the ſpirit of love and charity animates all your Congregations; and no doubt he that ought to be the mouth of the aſſembly, will conſider that Biſhops are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of mercy, and not of juſtice; and that to them our Lord ſaid, <hi>I leave peace with you,</hi> but ſaid not I leave vengeance with you; howſoever the wiſedom of <hi>M.</hi> the Cardinal will ſtrip off all the Thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prickles of paſſions, and ſweeten all the bitterneſs of figures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they arrive to come near the <hi>King.</hi> This Divine ſpirit is far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting all Orations, all deliberations, and all humane affairs, and in this he will eaſily finde a temper both to preſerve the honour of the Church, and yet not oppreſs the humility of him that ſubmits; both to give full ſatisfaction to the firſt order, and yet not withdraw regard from the merit of the ſecond; both to make us ſee heads bowed and knees bended before the Altars; and yet no houſes demoliſhed, nor governments deſtroyed, whereof the Altars ſhould receive no benefit. I am in hope you will do me the favour to inform me of the occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of the whole hiſtory, whereof I doubt not, but you are your
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:120345:117"/>
ſelf one of the principal parties, and I expect by your Letters a true relation of all the news that runs about. In the mean time Sir, I truſt you will not take it ill that I ſpeak unto you of this great affair, as a man that ſees it afar off; and whom you appoint ſometimes to deliver his adviſe upon matters, of which he hath but ſmall underſtanding. At your return we will renue the Commerce we have diſcontinued, and ſince you will have it ſo, I will once again play the Oratour, and the Politician before you; yet I fear me much, you will ſcarce be ſuffered to keep your promiſe with me; I ſee you are more born to action than to reſt, and that our rural pleaſures are not worthy ſo much as to amuſe ſo great a ſpirit as yours is, I therefore wiſh you ſuch as are worthy of you; that is, the ſolideſt and the perfecteſt, and ſuch as glorious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements and glorious actions leave behinde them; and I love not my ſelf ſo much that I am not much more</p>

                     <p>THe ſmall ſervice you deſired of me is not worth conſidering, but onely for the great thanks I have received for it; I had altogether forgot it when I received your Letter, which makes me yet forget it more in making me to remember it. You have words that change things, and in your language an impuiſſant willingneſs is an immortal obligation. If you make ſo great account of good deſires, I marvel what price you ſet upon good deeds; and if you thus beſtow your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements without neceſſity, I fear you will want them when you have need; you ſhould go more reſerveldy to work, and retain more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence for the future. A man may be a good huſband, and yet not be covetous; and ſeeing limits and bounds are fit in all caſes, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be unfit in the caſe of courteſie: Think not therefore Sir, that herein you have done an act of acknowledgement; you have gone far beyond the bounds of this virtue. If there be a vice oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to ungratefulneſs, your too great officiouſneſs hath made you fall into it; and by the exceſs you have avoided the defect. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of <hi>M.</hi> the Cardinal <hi>Bentivoglio</hi> have no need of recommending, but amongſt people that are not yet Civilized; that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns his honour, is no matter of indifferency to them that know his virtue, and they that know it not are no better than Barbarians. If to do him ſervice I had not run whither you prayed me but to go,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:120345:118"/>
and if I had not required an abſolute ſuppreſſion of that diſcourſe, whereof you required onely but a ſweetning; I had performed my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but very weakly, and had deſerved blame in that for which you praiſe me. Though his name were not reſplendent in hiſtory, nor his dignity in the Church, yet he ſhould have luſtre enough in his very ſtile and writings, and though he were not a Grand-childe of <hi>Kings,</hi> and a Senatour of the whole earth; yet I finde ſomething in him more worth than all that: I conſider him without his Purple, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of all external ornaments; regarding onely thoſe that are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to him; and which would make him moſt illuſtrious, though he had but al black cap on his head, and moſt eminent, though he were but a private man. Theſe are advantages he hath over other men, and which he communicates to this age of the World; goods that he poſſeſſeth and I enjoy. For I vow unto you that in this ſad place whither my deſire to pleaſe hath entrapped; and where there is no talk but of Suits and quarrels; I ſhould not know in the World how to paſs my time; if I had not brought his book along with me. This hath been the companion of my voyage, and is now the comforter of my Exile; and after I am dulled with a deal of troubleſom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, and have my ears filled with idle chat, I go and purifie my ſelf in his delicate relations; and gather my ſpirits together, which the noiſe and clatter had before diſperſed. I never ſaw in ſo ſober and chaſte a ſtile, ſo much fulneſs and delight; if nature herſelf would ſpeak, ſhe could never make choiſe of more proper terms than thoſe he uſeth; and where proper terms fail, ſhe could never more diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly borrow forraign than he doth. The Character of his phraſe is ſo noble, that by this onely, without any other ſigns I ſhould eaſily know he is come of a good houſe; and I ſee that fortune, which hath been ſo great an enemy of his bloud, and hath done ſo much hurt to his anceſtors, hath not yet been able to take from him the mark of their greatneſs, nor the manners and language of a Prince. Afterwards you give me thanks for loving qualities that are ſo lovely, and that making profeſſion of Letters, I am put in paſſion for him, who preſerves their honour, and who in his Countrey is the Crown and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Muſes; as often as there is queſtion for his ſervice I ſhall need no ſecond conſideration to put me in heat about it; I tell you plainly, I ſhall do it no whit the more for any love of you; I intreat you to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide ſome occaſion apart from all intereſts of his, where you may ſee the extraordinary account I make of your merits, and the deſire I have to manifeſt unto you that I am</p>

                     <p>YOu could never have fallen again to your Pen upon better terms than you have done; and I have a conceit your ſilence hath not been ſo much a neglect as a meditation. The Letter you plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to write unto me is ſo full of infinite excellent things, that it ſeems you have been making proviſion three years together to make one feaſt, and that your ſparing for ſo long a time had no other mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but to be magnificent for one day. The diſpatch of the <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinopolitan</hi> ſlave you ſent me, and the news of <hi>Koppenhagen</hi> you writ unto me are ſo inriched with ornaments of your making, that I ſee plainly whatſoever paſſeth through your hands receiveth an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of excellency, and that glorious atchievements have need of you to be their Hiſtorian. It is not ſtrange unto me that <hi>M.</hi> your brother hath pleaded my cauſe, I am an eternal client of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and as it is my part to honour my benefactors, ſo it is yours to preſerve your benefits: But verily I could never have thought this laſt action ſhould have had the Court of <hi>Denmark</hi> for a Theater, and the <hi>King</hi> and his Daughters the Princeſſes for Judges. You ſent me word I had a famous decree paſſed on my ſide, and that the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailant was as much hiſſed at, as the defendant was applauded. God be praiſed that grants us juſtice amongſt the Gothes, for injuries done us by the <hi>French;</hi> and that raiſeth up in an end of the World a ſoveraign defendor of perſecuted innocency, ſuch ſuccour ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he hath extraordinarily afforded when men abandon her; the Lions do become humane, rather than leave her without protection; and in the moſt frightfull deſarts there have been found Nurſes for Children, whom the cruelty of their Mothers had expoſed. Let us therefore never believe that ſweetneſs and humanity are qualities of the Earth, or of the Air; they are neither proper goods of the eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, nor captive virtues of the <hi>Grecians.</hi> They are wandring and paſſant, all climates receive them in their turn, and it is not the <hi>Cim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick Cherſoneſus</hi> any longer, it is <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Achaia</hi> that at this day are Barbarians. This Divine Princeſs of whom your brother writes ſuch wonders, hath no doubt contributed much to this change, and and though there ſhould ſhine no other Sun upon the Banks of the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, this one were enough to make virtue bud forth in all hearts, and to make Arts and Diſcipline to flouriſh in all parts. This is a ſecond <hi>Pallas</hi> that ſhall have her Temples, and her ſuppliants; ſhe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:120345:119"/>
ſhall be preſident of Letters and ſtudies, as well as the former. Even that which you ſay of the defect of her birth, and of the obſcurity of her Mother, might be ground enough for a Poet to make an entire work, and to aſſure us that ſhe was born and came out of her Fathers head: at leaſt, Sir, if your relations be true, ſhe is the lively image of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the interpretour of his thoughts, the greateſt ſtrength of his eſtate, and who by her eyes and tongue reigneth and ruleth over all objects, that either ſee, or hear. Why ſhould I diſſemble, or hide my content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? I muſt confeſs I am proud in the higheſt degree for the praiſes ſhe hath given me. Never Prince paſſed the <hi>Rhine</hi> more happily than mine hath done, ſeeing ſo good Fortune hath attended him there, and that there he ſhould be crowned by a hand, which was able to give wounds to all others. What ſhall I ſay more? I ſcorn all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Triumphs when I think upon this: I hope for no luſtre, but from her ſplendour, I ſeek for no glory, but in her recommendation; her onely voice is inſtead of the ſuffrages of a whole Diet of all the North; and what reaſon they ſhould not for ever be baniſhed the Empire, who blame that which ſhe praiſeth, or that would oppoſe the ſoveraignty of her excellent judgement? As for our common enemy condemned by her, to keep company with the Hobgoblins of <hi>Norway;</hi> ſince he is no longer in the World, is no longer in ſtate to do her obeyſance. If it be not that God will have that to be the place of his purgatory which ſhe would have to be the place of his baniſhment, and that this proud ſpirit is confinde to live amongſt the tempeſts and other frantick iſſues of the North, as <hi>Varro</hi> ſpeaks of Satyrs. You have read I ſuppoſe the Dialogues of Saint <hi>Gregorie;</hi> and therefore muſt needs know that all Souls are not purged after one manner, but ſome paſs through the fire, and others endure the Ice; and the extremity of cold is no leſs an inſtrument of Divine juſtice, than extremity of heat. But I purpoſe not to ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broach a queſtion of Divinity, for I ſhould then begin a new Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and it is now time I ſhould finiſh this: but telling you firſt, that he which ſhall deliver it to you, hath in charge to preſent you a larger diſcourſe; and to let you ſee, that there is both Greek and Latine in our Village. If it were not for my ſtudy, my ſolitude would neither have excuſe nor comfort, and yet ſhall not have it perfect neither, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you bring it to me; and be ſo honeſt a man as to come and ſee me: as I moſt heartily intreat you to do; and to believe that I paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately am</p>

                     <p>BE not ſcandalized, nor take exception at my ſilence. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Letters I write are but the paiment of my old debts: and before I anſwer one, I ſuffer my ſelf to be ſummoned three or four times. I ſeldom ſtay upon matter of complement; all I can do, is but to defend my ſelf untowardly; I think my ſelf ſufficiently honeſt, if I be but indifferently uncivil; and becauſe I am apt to do courteſies voluntarily; I expect alſo voluntarily to receive them; of you, Sir, eſpecially, who judge not friendſhip by the look, and knows that ſuperſtition is more ceremonious, than true piety. The new favours I have received from your Muſes are to me as they ought to be, exceeding ſenſible: yet think not, that this makes me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get your former benefits: and that I carry not in minde, that it is you that gave me the firſt taſte of good, and the principles of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; you do but build upon the foundation you laid your ſelf; and give eſtimation to your own pains. Having been my guide in a Countrey which I know not; it is for your honour it ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, I have made ſome progreſs there, that ſo it may appear your directions are good. Thus your Poem hath in it a hidden art, which few underſtand; and I am but the colour of your deſign. You en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy your ſelf all the glory you have done me; all the glory you have imparted to me ſtayes ſtill with your ſelf; and you have found out a way how to praiſe your ſelf, without ſpeaking of your ſelf: and how to be liberal without parting from any thing. If you come this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to <hi>Paris,</hi> I will give you account of an infinite number of things that will not diſlike you; and in revenge thereof, I require to hear from you ſome news of our male-content;

                     <p>I Finde by the Letter which Mounſieur <hi>de Mantin</hi> writ unto you, that you have done me good Offices with him; and that upon your word, he takes me for more than I am worth. It is your part now to make that ſure unto him, which you have warranted, and to diſguiſe me with ſo much Art, that may make good your firſt deceit by a ſecond. For to think that I ſhall be able to anſwer his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, and ſatisfie your promiſe: I know he expects too much; and know you have promiſed too much; that which he ſpeaks of me and of my writings, ſeems rather to come from the paſſion of a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, than from the integrity of a Judge: and I ought to take it, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a Preſent, than as a Recompence. I know beſides, that the place from whence he writes hath alwayes been the habitation of courteſie; and that the ſpark of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted there, hath ſince it parted from thence; left a light which gives an influence to the manners and ſpirits of the Countrey. So that to this day diſtinction muſt be made between the civilities of <hi>Avignon,</hi> which extend to all ſorts of ſtrangers, and the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an able man, which reſpect nothing but reaſon; and a difference muſt be put between the honeſty of a complement, and the Religion of a teſtimony. Mounſieur <hi>Malherbe</hi> deceaſed, who never gave any mans merit, more than its due: and but coldly prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the moſt praiſe-worthy things; yet hath heretofore to me, in ſo
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:120345:120"/>
high a degree extolled this man, of whom we ſpeak; that I could not but think, it muſt needs be a very extraordinary virtue that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported him ſo unwontedly, and a very preſſing verity, that forced him to open himſelf ſo freely. I have ſince been confirmed in my judgement of him by divers perſons of good quality, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by the voice of all our Countrey: But yet there is in this more cauſe for me to fear, than hope: Wiſe men do but onely taſte an errour; with which common people drink themſelves drunk: They do not plunge themſelves in falſe opinions, they paſs them lightly over; and I am afraid you will ere long receive another Letter in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation of this, he hath now written ſo much in my favour: if the worſt come to the worſt; and that there be no means for me, to keep all the good you have gotten me; I yet may lawfully require to have a part left me; which Mounſieur your brother in Law cannot honeſtly deny me. I am unfit for the terms he gives me; I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly return them back to himſelf: Let him keep his admiring for miracles; or at leaſt for the great ſtupendious works of nature; I aſpire not, nor have any pretence to ſo high a degree of his account; but I think I have right to his friendſhip; and that both of you are my debters of ſome good will; ſeeing I honour you both exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and paſſionately I am</p>

Is it fit to be a judge of a Science, of which it is yet but learning the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet? It ſcarce knows viſible Objects, and runs a hazard, when it conſiders but the exteriour face of nature; as for that which is above, it climbs not to it, nor ſoars ſo high. My curioſity is not ſo ventrous: and concerning the condition of ſuperiour things; I wholly refer my ſelf to the Sorbone. Never think therefore that I will give my cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of your book: I have not yet diſcovered the bottom; onely the bark, I muſt tell you ſeems very precious; and I am raviſhed with the ſound and harmony of things, I underſtand not; this kinde of writing

would have aſtoniſhed Philoſophers whom it could not have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded: and if Saint <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> had but ſhewed ſuch a piece as this to <hi>Themiſtius,</hi> he could not chuſe but have been moved with it, and muſt needs have admired the probability of Chriſtianity; though he had not known the ſecret.

They live and move, and I ſee in them the ſinews of the firſt Chriſtians; and the ſtile of that Heroick age, where one and the ſame virtue, gave life both to diſcourſe and actions; gave influence both to the Soul and to the courage; made both Doctours and alſo Martyrs. Tell me true, Did you not propoſe to your ſelf a Pattern to follow? Have you not been at the Oracle 
of —: have you not received ſome inſpiration from our excellent friend? Me thinks I meet with his very Character: In certain paſſages I obſerve ſome marks and traces of his ſpirit; and when I read them, cannot ſometimes forbear crying out: <hi>Sic oculos, ſic ille manus,</hi> &amp;c. You need not take offence at my ſuſpition: ſo noble a reſemblance is an inferiority lifted up extreamly high. You are not therein his Ape, but his Son: There is nothing baſe not mean in the imitation of ſo high and perfect an <hi>Idea:</hi> and you know the example of <hi>Plato,</hi> made <hi>Philo</hi> go cheek by jowl with him. All I aſk of you at <hi>Paris,</hi> where you ſo liberally offer me all the good Offices you can do, is but this; that you will do me the favour, to aſſure that great perſonage of the great reverence I bear to his merits: and what glory I count it to be counted his friend: but I require with all the continuation of your own love, with which you can honour none, that is more truely than I am</p>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:120345:121"/>
dance a round; theſe are his ordinary ſports, and to uſe the phraſe of our friend; but the outſide of his ſecret Philoſophy. Signiour <hi>Mercurio Cardano,</hi> ſwears he hath ſeen all this, and more; enough to finde you diſcourſe for many meetings: and if you appoint him to ſet hand to his Pen, he will be a <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> to this <hi>Appolonius.</hi> He hath told me, as he hath heard it from him, that for certain, the Heavens menace <hi>France,</hi> with a notable revolution; and that the fall of —, hath not been ſo much the end, as the change of our miſeries. For my ſelf who know, that God never makes Mountibanks of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel; and that the virtue of the <hi>King,</hi> is able to correct the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of the Stars: I laugh at the vanitie of ſuch preſages; and look for nothing but happineſs from the aſcendent and fortune of ſo great a Prince. But to change this diſcourſe, and this Mountibank for another: I have ſeen the man Sir, that is all armed with Thorns: that purſues a Propoſition to the uttermoſt bounds of Logick; that in moſt peaceable converſations, will put forth nothing, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of nothing that is not a Dilemma, or a Syllogyſme. To tell you true, what I think of him; he would pleaſe me more if he had leſs reaſon: this quarrelſom eloquence affrights me more than it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades me. They which commonly converſe with him; run in my opinion the ſame fortune, which they do, that live near the falls of <hi>Nilus;</hi> there is no overflowing like that of his words, a man cannot ſafely give him audience; a <hi>Headach</hi> for three dayes after, is the leaſt hurt he can take, that but hears him talk an after-noon. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that brings you this Letter, hath charge given him from all in general to entreat you Sir, not to forſake us in ſo important a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but to come and free our companies from one of the greateſt croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that hath a long time afflicted civil ſociety. You are the onely man in whom this Sophiſter hath ſome belief: and therefore none but you, likely to reduce him to common right; and to bring his ſpirit to ſubmit it ſelf to Cuſtom and Uſage. You can if you pleaſe make it appear unto him; that an honeſt man propoſes alwayes his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, no otherwiſe than as doubts; and never raiſeth the ſound of his voice, to get advantage of them, that ſpeak not ſo loud: that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſo hatefull, as a Chamber Preacher, who delivers but his own word; and determines without Warrant, that it is fit to avoid geſtures, which are like to threatnings, and terms which carry the ſtile of Edicts; I mean, that it is not fit to accompany his diſcourſe with too much action; nor to affirm any thing too peremptorily. Laſtly, that conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation reflects more upon a popular eſtate, than upon a Monarchy; and that every man hath there a right of ſuffrage: and the benefit of liberty. You know Sir, that for want of due obſerving theſe petty rules, many have fallen into great inconveniences; and you remember him who ſpilt

I had done it very innocently, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, if I had ſpoken any thing well; who was ſo ill prepared for it. I ſhould have hit a mark which I aimed not at; and have drawn a Picture, by the caſual falling down of my Penſil. My drift was to entertain my friend, who was accuſtomed to the negligence of my ſtile: and with whom; if I committed any fault, I was ſure of pardon. He cries not out murther, upon ſeeing one Vowel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter another, nor ſtands amazed at meeting with an untoward word, as if it were a Monſter: This favour I receive from him; and he, the like from me: we allow all liberty to our thoughts: and if in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, we ſhould not ſometimes violate Laws of our Art, we ſhould never ſhew confidence enough in our friendſhip.

Be not you of ſo little equity to your ſelf; and ſuffer me to tell you what I think: ſeeing I think nothing, but that which is the common opinion; and I deliver not ſo much my own particular conceit, as the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral belief of the whole World: They who prefer a Captain of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabins</hi> before <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great; and know not how to praiſe the integrity of a Stateſman, without affronting that of <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> fall into that exceſs, which reaſon requires ſhould be avoided. Yet we ought not for all this, generally to ſlight all merit of the preſent age; and fancy to our ſelves, that we are not bound to revere vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, unleſs it be conſecrated by Antiquity. For my ſelf, I judge more favourably of things preſent, and do not think I run any hazard in ſubſcribing to the Popes judgement of you, that <hi>in ſerving the</hi> King, <hi>you have been his governour.</hi> This would be to be too ſcrupulous, to fear miſtaking, after him that they ſay can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre; and you are too courteous, to count it a courteſie that I do my duty; and to give me thanks that I am not a Schiſmatick. Concerning the laſt Article of your Letter; I ſay it gives me not ſo much, as a temptation: neither am I indeed capable to receive it. It ſufficeth me Sir, that you protect my repoſe here; for to enter into defence of my intereſts in the place where you are, as you do me the honour to promiſe me; I would adviſe you not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it. You could never look for better ſucceſs, than the prime man of this age had, who could not obtain of —; the favour he required of him, in my behalf. It is much eaſier to break down the Alpes; and to bridle the Ocean, than to procure the paiment of my Penſion: and there is nothing that can make a worker of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles ſee, there is ſomething impoſſible for him to do; but onely my ill Fortune. There are the bounds of this power, which is ſo much envied: The good will he bears me, cannot draw from the <hi>Kings</hi> Officers the eight hundred pounds, which are due unto me:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:120345:123"/>
and it is Gods will he ſhould be diſobeyed in this, that I may be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt them who ſay that he is abſolute. I onely intreat you, ſeeing you deſire to oblige me to you, to ſhew him the conſtancy of my paſſions, which is obdurate againſt ill ſucceſſes, and preſerves it ſelf entire amidſt the ruins of my hopes. It ſhall be ſatisfaction enough for me that he do me the honour to believe I can adore freely and without hope of reward; and that I ſhould do him as great reverence if he were not in ſo great a height of happineſs. I expect this favour from your ordinary goodneſs, and promiſe my ſelf that you will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alwayes have a little love for me, ſeeing I have a will to be all my life moſt perfectly</p>

                     <p>SAy what you can, I am not ſo indulgent to my paſſion as you are injurious to your own merits. Amongſt all your good qualities, you have one that ſeems an Enemy to all the reſt; detraction doth you more injuſtice than you do your ſelf, and envy it ſelf gives you that which your own modeſty takes away from you. This is not to handle the truth civllly, to reſpect her then when ſhe embraceth you? This is to render her civil for good, to call her <hi>fabulous,</hi> when ſhe calls you virtuous. I finde in this Sir more ſcruple than Religion: The firſt and moſt ancient charity is therehy broken, and you are faulty in the firſt principle of your duty; if owing juſtice to all the World, you deny to do it to your ſelf alone. It muſt be a great preciſeneſs of conſcience that ſhall finde in you the evils you accuſe your ſelf of, and a ſight more clear than mine that ſhall ſee defaults in the courſe of your life. If you have any; they are ſurely imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, and ſuch as fell not under ſence. They come not within the knowledge of any; It muſt be a ſecret between your confeſſour and you. None is known Sir, at leaſt not known to be revealed, and if any were ſo known, it would rather be ſound a proof of humility than a mark of imperfection. I am none therefore, as you ſay I am, of theſe charitable lyars, who attribute to them they love all that they want; nor of theſe forgers of Commonwealths, who carry

their imagination beyond all poſſibility of things; I preſent not unto you an <hi>Idea</hi> to make you better then you are, but taking you into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration I propoſe you as my example to ſtir me up to goodneſs; I draw your picture for my own uſe and not for your glorie; I intend more the inſtructing my ſelf, than the ſmoothing you with fair words. The object of ſo elevated a virtue fills my minde with great deſires, and if it aſtoniſh me ſometimes with its heighth, it makes me at leaſt ſee by experience, that an inferiour virtue is poſſible to be acquired; ſo that to ſay true, I ſtudy you more than I praiſe you, and am in this more ſwayed with intereſt than with paſſion: I mean this paſſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eyes, that riſeth onely from the animal part; for as for that which is reaſonable and works with knowledge, I have that for you in the higheſt degree, and by all kinde of obligations and of duties am</p>

                     <p>I Acquit my ſelf of a charge that was laid upon me, and ſend you from Mounſieur <hi>Favereau</hi> the Verſes he lately made for the <hi>King;</hi> they have had the approbation of all <hi>France,</hi> but they have not yet had his own, and if this publick judgement be not confirmed by your particular, he takes it but as the paſſion of a Mother; and that <hi>France</hi> doth but flatter her Children. He thinks no glory is legitimate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you are not the diſtributour, and that things are not ſo good by their own goodneſs, as by the account you make of them; you ſee by this Sir what rank you hold in the Common-wealth of Letters, and that I am not the onely man that look upon you with veneration, being ſeated in the Throan of the great <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and giving Laws to all the civil parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> The higheſt degree that a man can aſpire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, who is Prince amongſt his own, is to become a judge amongſt ſtrangers; and there to get reverence where he cannot pretend ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. To this uppermoſt Region of merit are you aſcended; the light of your doctrine ſhines upon more than one people, and more than one Countrey; it ſpreads and communicates it ſelf in divets places and kindes; it hath as well adorers afar off, as admirers at home: He of whom I ſpeak Sir, is worth a whole multitude, and makes not onely a part of a

choiſe company, but is himſelf alone a company and a number. Do you aſk for qualities intellectual and moral? for virtues civil and military, would you have a Philoſopher; a Mathematician; a Poet, for Latine, Italian, French? you ſhall finde them all in his one perſon. He hath the Key of the moſt ſublime ſciences, and the ſuperintendance of the nobleſt Arts. Heretofore he hath been the diſpenſer of the conceits of <hi>Marino,</hi> the reformer and pruning knife of the ſuperfluities of his ſtile, at this time he is overſeer of all cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious works; the Oracle that Carvers conſult, and the ſpirit that guides the hand before Painters. He meddles in an infinite number of things with equal capacity, and hath as many trades as the Sage of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> had; but makes better works of them than he did. It is not poſſible either to fill his ſpirit, or to ſet it about work enough; ſo greedy and unſatiable it is of knowledge, ſo impatient of reſt, and growing freſh with action. And to impart to you the expreſſion of a gallant friend of ours; he is in as great a heat for the pleaſures of the minde, as the Princes of <hi>Aſia</hi> are for the pleaſures of the body; and as they have many Concubines beſides the <hi>Sultana,</hi> which they marry, ſo hath he one profeſſion as his principal ſtudy, but leaves not for all that to follow other exerciſes, though follow them but with inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our affection; ſo that it cannot be ſaid of him, that he knows all, but that he ought to know; and that he is nothing leſs than that he ought to be. He acquits himſelf moſt worthily of his charge, and never ſtands in contemplation, when it is time to be in action. If he be a great Poet, he is no leſs a great Lawyer; he makes as well the draught of a Proceſs as the deſcription of a Tempeſt; and having ſung <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Amarillis</hi> with an admirable grace, he treats of <hi>Seia</hi> and <hi>Sempro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> with no leſs ſolidity. I give this teſtimony as religiouſly of him, as if I give it before a Judge, and as if my writing were upon Oath. Is it not fit you ſhould be ignorant of his merit, whom without any merit you ought to reſpect, though but onely for his reſpect to you. It is fit you know that he is an elevated perſon, humbling himſelf before you, and a Saint offering you ſacrifice. It is fit alſo I ſhould ſatisfie his deſire, which you ſhall ſee in the word he hath written to you, as he was going out of his Inne and taking Coach, but that done, Sir, it is not fit I ſhould forget my ſelf; I intreat you therefore you will be pleaſed that in preſenting to you the vows of another, I may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you alſo my own, and make you this true proteſtation, that I am</p>

                     <p>THe Letter you took the pains to write unto me hath calmed my ſpirit, and given it eaſe; I could have no comfort of the news of your death, but onely by that of your reſurrection; and to make an end of weeping for you, it was neceſſary you ſhould come your ſelf and ſtay my tears. I am none of theſe broachers of Paradoxes, whom too much reaſon makes unreaſonable, and have no feeling either of joy or grief My ſpirit is more tender, and my Philoſophy more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane; and let them, as long as they pleaſe, call theſe paſſions infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet for my part I had rather have my malady than their health; If I had loſt you, I had loſt part of my ſelf, and ſhould never think my ſelf an entire man again, and if I had not hope to enjoy again your learned converſation, I ſhould finde nothing but bitterneſs in my life; nothing in my ſtudies but Thorns, at this time eſpecially, when I am promiſed a retreat three miles from <hi>Bloys,</hi> and that I ſhall come under the juriſdiction of <hi>M.</hi> the Lieutenant General. I do not much rejoyce at this your new Dignity, becauſe I do not rejoyce at the ſervitude of my friends; and becauſe I do not count it any great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to be alwayes handling the Sores and Ulcers of the people. I make more reckoning of your idleneſs than of your imployment, and of the Elegy you will make than of all the judgements you will give.

I had more to ſay, but I was pull'd away from my Letter, and your own beſt friends debauch me; I muſt therefore perforce leave you, yet aſſuring you once again that I am infinitely glad I ſhed my tears for you without cauſe, and that no man is more truly than my ſelf</p>

ſo pleaſing a viſit, which would have comforted me for a troubleſom one that afflicted me not a little the day before. But the miſchief is, that I was come hither before your ticket, and all I can do now, is to let you know the grief I take, that my inclination and my affairs lye not alwayes in the ſame place.

Thanks be to God I am now in place of ſafety, where you may well think I ſeek rather to quench my thirſt, than to clear my Sun burnt ſkin; and look more after refreſhing than tricking my ſelf up. To this purpoſe I forget nothing of that I have learned in <hi>Italy:</hi> My ordinary Diet is upon the fruits of Autumne; being of opinion that no intemperance of theſe pure Viands can be diſhoneſt, and that it is not fit to be ſober as long as the Trees offer us their ſtore, and temptour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. Be pleaſed Sir, that my buſineſs may not be to do untill the trees ſhall have nothing upon them but leaves; and that I may not go to the Cittie but when the winter drives me from the Countrey. In the mean time, I leave mine honour to your care, in the place where you are, and I recommend unto you a little reputation that is left me, having ſo many wars upon me, and ſo many combinations made againſt me. I would be glad my name had leſs luſtre, and my life more quiet, but I know not where to finde obſcurity; I am ſo well known, if not by my good qualities, at leaſt by my ill fortune, that though I ſhould baniſh my ſelf into a ſtrange Countrey, I do not think I could be hidden. <hi>

I owe you thanks for it in my own behalf: and beſides, being joyned as I am with him in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all goods and evils; you cannot faſten upon him, and leave me free. He ſends me no word of the nature of his buſineſs, in which you have done him ſuch good offices: but I doubt me, it is ſome imployment beyond the Alpes, and dependance upon ſome Ambaſſadour to <hi>Rome.</hi> Whereof I think I may truely ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving reins to my Paſſion at all; that he hath both the ſubſtance and the ſuppleneſs, which are neceſſary in dealing with the brains of that Countrey; and that he, under whom he ſerves, may lie and ſleep all the time of his imployment, without any prejudice at all to the <hi>Kings</hi> ſervice.

mine, and which I could not read without ſome touch of vain-glorie. There is a pleaſure in yielding to ſuch ſweet temptations, and though I know my merit hath no right to ſo gracious a remembrance, yet by what title ſoever I come to be happy, I am not a little proud of my fortune. Theſe are Sir the meer effects of your goodneſs, and your experiments in that art, with which you know how to gain hearts, and to purchaſe men without buying them. The faireſt part of the earth, in which you have left a dear remembrance of your name, gives this teſtimony of you by the mouth of its Princes, and of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but ſeeing in the place where you are, you meet with ſpirits of love and tenderneſs; it cannot be that any ſhould eſcape you, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom you have any deſign to take hold.

                     <p>I Am very ſlow in anſwering your Letter, but I could not do it ſooner; after three moneths of continual agitation, this is my firſt hour of leaſure, and the firſt place I finde of commerce, to tender you the complement I owe you. I ſee well that your word is not ſubject to the accidents of the World, and that I have choſen a plot which is out of the reach of Fortune. Your affection to me is not of this brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle matter that friendſhips at Court be made of; it is of a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſtuff, and ſuch as neither time can wear out, nor my negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence weaken. I need not doubt of preſerving a good that you keep
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:120345:126"/>
for me; your faithfulneſs is more than my negligence, and I am more aſſured of your honeſty than of my own; notwithſtanding what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty ſoever I have of your love, it is no double to me to have new aſſurances: Men that are well enough perſwaded, yet will go to a Sermon, and take a pleaſure to hear that they know already. For my ſelf I can never be weary of reading a thing that gives me ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and though it were as feigned as it is true, yet you write it with ſo good a grace, that it would be a pleaſure to be ſo deceived; yet it was fit, you ſhould have ſtayed there; and not cauſe me to fall from joy into preſumption: How can you look my ſpirit ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it ſelf within its bounds, knowing that I am talked of at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that my name is ſometimes pronounced by the moſt eloquent mouth of <hi>Italy?</hi> you ſhould have concealed the expreſs charge you had from <hi>M.</hi> the Cardinal of <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> to ſend me his Hiſtory; or at leaſt for a temper to my vanity, you ſhould have told me at the ſame time, that I muſt not impure a favour to my own ſufficiency, for which I am beholding to your good offices; I may believe Sir that he had never had this thought of me, if you had not ſtirred it up in him by ſome favourable mention you made of my perſon; and I know he puts ſo great a truſt in you, that after you have once made a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, he would make a conſcience to uſe his own judgement in examining my worth. From what ground ſoever my happineſs comes, I am bound to acknowledge the viſible cauſe, and to that I deſtinate my firſt good dayes journey that God ſhall ſend me. I will not fail to give thanks to <hi>M.</hi> the Cardinal, and to give him an account of my reading, that he may ſee I know as well how to receive as he to give. In the mean time I offer him a preſent far unworthy of the magnificence of his, and which will ſhew him, how with his hook of Gold he hath fiſhed but braſs, ſuch as it is you ſhall do me a favour to preſent it to him, and to let me hold the poſſeſſion I have in your love, whoſe I am all my life</p>

                     <p>MY dear Coſin, your Letter hath told me no news, it hath one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed me in my opinion; and teſtified that you are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes good, and alwayes do me the honour to love me. You have qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:120345:127"/>
of greater luſter than this, but you have none of greater uſe; and they that could live without your wiſdom, yet cannot bear the miſs of your goodneſs. My ſiſter and I continue to implore it in a buſineſs which is already ſet on foot by your commendation, and which attends a full accompliſhment by your ſecond endeavour. It is neither without example nor without reaſon; it needs but ſuch an undertaker as your ſelf, and you may eaſily ſave it from rigorous juſtice, if you will but lend a little aid to its equity. Of your will I make no doubt, it is the continual agitation of the Court that makes me fear, which drives men one way and their affairs another. But if the Heavens help us not, we are not like in haſte to ſee it in any ſtate of conſiſtence; it will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes floting like the Iſland of <hi>Greece,</hi> untill a great birth ſhall make it ſtay; and that God make ſure the <hi>Kings</hi> victories by the <hi>Queens</hi> fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. In the mean time it is not fit you ſhould ſtay at home, but that you ſhould make one in all voyages; but you muſt not be of theſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellours that get many hoaſts, and few friends. You are in a ſtate of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging and making men beholding to you by doing alwayes good; and now for fear you ſhould want matter to work upon, I offer you matter here to ſet you a work. Be pleaſed Sir; my dear Coſin, that I intreat you to deliver to — the Letter I writ unto him; and when you deliver it, to teſtifie withall unto him, that having the honour to be to you as I am, the things that touch me muſt needs concern you; Heretofore I have held good place in his confidence, and to uſe the terms of a man you hate not: <hi>Vetus mihi cum eo confuetudo &amp; cum privatus erat Amici vocabamur.</hi> Even lately at <hi>Paris</hi> he offered me courteſies that might have contented a prouder mans vanity than mine; and I received from him more good words than was poſſible for me to return him. But theſe illuſtrious friendſhips require continual cares, and an aſſiduity without ceſſation. I know they are ſubject to a thouſand inconveniences, and that they grow cold if they be not ſtirred up and kindled continually. Three words of your mouth ſpoken with a due accent, may ſave me the ſolliciting of three moneths, and my requeſts ought not to ſeem uncivil; ſeeing I deſire nothing but that which — hath done me the honour to promiſe me; and thinks no otherwiſe, but that I have received it. To this purpoſe I ſend you a ſhort inſtruction for —: and you may be pleaſed to be a means, that he caſt his eyes upon it; at ſuch time as the buſineſs he hath about your perſon ſhall permit him. I would not ſollicite you ſo boldly: nor preſs upon you ſo burdenſome a familiarity, if you had not your ſelf made the overture firſt. It is a perſecution you have drawn upon your ſelf by the liberal offers you made me in your Letter; and I conceive you did ſpeak as you mean, as I do, in proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I honour you with my Soul; and am</p>

                     <p>I Do not know my ſelf in your Letters: you are like thoſe Painters, that care not for making a face like, ſo they make it fair. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you thought upon ſome honeſter man than my ſelf; when you took the pains to write unto me; and your <hi>Idea</hi> went beyond your ſubject: or elſe you meant to excite me to virtue by a new ſubtility; and the praiſes you give me are but diſguiſed exhortations. They could nor be Sir, either more fine, or more delicate: and I do not think, that your pretended Barbariſm comes any thing behinde the <hi>Grecian</hi> eloquence. But tell me true; Is it not as artificial as <hi>Brutus</hi> his folly? And are not you in plain terms a Coſener, to make us believe you come from that climate, from whence the cold and foul weather comes? Whereas it cannot be you ſhould be born any where but in the heart of <hi>Paris,</hi> or if any place be more <hi>French</hi> then <hi>Paris,</hi> that certainly muſt needs have been your Cradle. You ſpeak too well, not to ſpeak naturally; this garb, and this purity, in which you expreſs your ſelf, is not a thing that can be learned by Books: you owe it to a nearer cauſe; and ſtudy goes not ſo far as it. There have ſtrangers been Marſhalls of <hi>France,</hi> but their accent hath alwayes diſcovered, they were not natural: and they have found it more eaſie, to merit the leading of our Armies, and to gain the favour of our <hi>King;</hi> than to learn our language, and attain a true pronouncing. But Sir, ſeeing in your perſon, there is ſeen an Ambaſſadour of eighteen years old; and a wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom without experience: there is not any thing, be it never ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full which being reported of you, may ſeem incredible after this. It is fit onely, that you make more account than you do, of this ſo rare and admirable a quality: and that you ſhould uſe it, according to its merits; and not to employ it upon baſe ſubjects, that are not worthy of it. Otherwiſe how good an Artiſt ſo ever you be; you will be blamed for making no better choiſe of your Materials; and my ſelf, who draw ſo much glory from your fault; had yet much rather ſee you employ your excellent language, in treating of Princes intereſts, and the preſent eſtate of <hi>Europe;</hi> than in advancing the value of a poor ſick man: who prayes you to keep your valuing, for —: and aſk you nothing but pitty; or at moſt but affection: if this be to merit it, that I paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly am</p>

                     <p>I Am exceedingly beholding to you for remembring me; and for the good news you have ſo liberally acquainted me withall. If they — loved Suger, as well as they love Salt; they ſhould have enough of it, never to drink any thing but Hyppocras; nor to eat any thing but Comfits. Without jeſting I vow, theſe are excellent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels; and their ſimplicity is more ſubtill than all the Art and Maxims of <hi>Florence.</hi> Theſe Mariners read Leſſons now to the inhabitants of <hi>Terra firma;</hi> and are become the <hi>Paedagogues</hi> of Princes. There is nothing of theirs that troubles me, but the propoſition of their Truce. They ſhould reject it, as a temptation of the Devil: and I dare ſwear, it was never ſet a foot, but to gain time and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: The good will, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> makes ſhew to bear them; is the baite they ſhew upon the hook they hide, he ſeeks not after them, but to catch them; and he makes ſhew of kindneſs; becauſe he could do no good with force. Though I have not read the Book you ſpake to me of; yet I doubt not of its worth and goodneſs; I know the Authour is a man of great learning and experience, and one that hath been brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel;</hi> I mean of —: who no doubt hath acquainted him with all the Myſteries of our ſtate. For my ſelf, it muſt needs be that I ſpeak but at hap hazard of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for it would be a miracle, if by living in the Woods, I ſhould learn the ſkill to govern the Citties; and that I ſhould be a Polititian and a Lawyer, being ſcarce either a man, or a Cittizen: for to ſpeak truely, if the firſt be a ſociable creature, and the other a manager of ſome part of the Common-wealth: I ſee not in the eſtate I am in, how I can juſtly pretend to either of theſe two qualities. In favour therefore of Mounſieur — I yield up my right in all the good I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from you; and in all the praiſes you give me, as things that much more belong to him than me. Admire as much as you will, his ſubtility; but yet make ſome reckoning of my true minde; and give him that which I leave him; but yet keep for me, that which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take from me, without doing me wrong: I mean your good will; which ought to be the prize of my paſſion, and of the fidelity, with which I ſhall be all my life</p>

                     <p>I Should be extreamly culpable, if you were not extreamly good; but I know, you are no rigorous exactour of that which is your due, and that you have much indulgence, for the faults of thoſe you love. My idleneſs is even become ſtupidity; and hath taken from me all uſe both of ſpeaking and writing; yet all things conſidered, this is no ill quality at this time: no man is bound to give account of his ſilence; and many become Delinquents for their ſpeaking. I do not think therefore you would aſk me news, in a time, when reporting it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: and when one may be called in queſtion to make explication of it before Magiſtrates; though the litteral ſenſe of our words be innocent, they may ſearch the allegorical, and ſtand punctual upon an equivocal term to make us culpable of another mans ſubtilty. But I defie the moſt pregnant Grammarian, and the moſt ſevere inquiſitour to find any fault in the proteſtation I make of moſt perfectly honouring your virtue, and of being with all my Soul</p>

                     <p>IF my Letters had not been loſt, you ſhould have known long ere this the joy I have had in being made certain of the moſt important truth, that ever kept my minde in ſuſpence; and in learning from your ſelf that you do me alwayes the honour to love me; not that I ever doubted of your goodneſs, but I have ſo much knowledge of my own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunateneſs, that I cannot hear any ill news ſo incredible which I do not believe to be very probable. Yet I perceive Sir, by your holding out ſo firmly in behalf of a party ruined, that you are not eaſily altered either in your opinions, or from your errours. That which you have once ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and indeed that you have but once conceived, is never changed nor revoked; and therefore as I have nothing more dear nor more precious than your friendſhip, ſo have I nothing alſo more aſſured, or of more ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. This your ancient <hi>German</hi> probity is not a whit altred by contagion of our ill examples, &amp; the ſtrength of your conſtitution hath been able
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:120345:130"/>
to reſiſt the ill air of our Court. It is not our of ignorance that you follow not the falſe maxims of this age; but follow your own and thoſe that be lawfull; and if it be true, that the King of the Flies hath a ſting indeed, but never ſtings; it is much more true of you, that having the power and ability to do evil, yet for all that you are no evil doer. But this would be too little to praiſe you but thus; they that underſtand you well, will ſay with me, there is nothing in virtue ſo high, or difficult, which your Soul hath not attained unto: and as nature hath given you all the good qualities that cannot be acquired by ſtudy', ſo your own ſtudy hath procured you all the good qualities that are not in the gift of nature. Though your courteſies had left me my firſt liberty, and that there were neither Obligation on your part, nor Reſentment on mine, yet I ſhould ſay as much as I do, and give this teſtimony of you before all the World, and I am not leſs true of my word than I am</p>

I have with a great deal of pleaſure read the Latine, which you did me the favour to ſend me; the force of the reaſoning, and the Oeconomy of the diſcourſe content me exceedingly; onely one little word diſtaſts me, and your friend might well have forborn to couple us with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans and Infidels. The liberty which the <hi>King</hi> gives his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, not to be of his opinion, ought not to reach to the ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of that opinion, and ſeeing he holds it a glorie to be the eldeſt Son of the Church, to call this Church a whore, is in good <hi>French</hi> to call —. He deſerves Sir more reſpect, and your Doctours ſhould have more diſcretion: For in truth, if their Religion were the prime Religion of the Kingdom, and that they were at liberty to preach it in the <hi>Lovure;</hi> they could never ſpeak in higher terms, nor handle Catholicks in a ruder manner than they do. I aſſure my ſelf you will be in this of my opinion: One muſt alwayes remember the condition of the time, and the ſtate of affairs; wiſe men will never provoke them that are eaſily able to undo them; and in the ancient triumphs it was lawfull for the Souldiers to ſcoff at their General; but it was not

lawfull for the vanquiſhed to ſpeak reproachfully of the Conquerour; you may pleaſe to make ſome reflection hereupon, and I know you will conceive that innocency it ſelf becomes culpable, if it draw on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. I bid you goodnight, and am</p>

                     <p>WIthout accepting the challenge you ſent me, I thank you for the care you had to make me winne honour; If it came of it ſelf I would perhaps not ſtick to receive it, but if it cannot be had without conteſting, I will none of it; I love my eaſe too well, I ſay not to loſe it, but even to hazard it in the beſt quarrel of the World. I am as patient and as utterly diſarmed as an Anabaptiſt; I am afraid of a Foyt, or a Squib; far from running upon Muſkets and Swords points, as they ſay in our Vicinage. It would be a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to draw a man of this humour to a Combat; but a much harder matter to make me ſtand in argumentation, being reſolved to let the World hold what opinion it pleaſeth, and even to forſake my own, if any man will wrangle with me for it. I deſire neither to eſtabliſh my own Maxims, nor to deſtroy other mens; and if a Maſter of Arts ſhould come and try me with <hi>Omnis Homo Currit,</hi> I would anſwer him <hi>Laſcialo andar;</hi> and if he ſhould go on and ſay, <hi>ſed Petrus Currit,</hi> I would reply, <hi>Laſcialo ſtar;</hi> and if he would conclude, <hi>Ergo Petrus eſt Homo,</hi> I would take my leave of him and ſay, <hi>Che m' Importa?</hi> I have very ſeriouſly conſidered of the the Letter

The concluſion is; He is a man I make infinite account of, and his friendſhip ſhall alwayes be dearer to me than my own opinion. I conjure you to give him aſſurance hereof, and to get his leave that I may live; ſeeing I am already beholding to you for ſo many other courteſies, and am alſo with all my Soul</p>

                     <p>IF it had not been for a troubleſom rheum which hath followed me now theſe fifteen dayes, I ſhould have ſooner thanked you for the new courteſies you have done me, and for the late pains you have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the moſt unprofitable ſervant you have. God will reward a nature ſo free and noble, for my ſelf I can but praiſe it, and give it the Teſtimony that is due unto it. But to make it perfect, I intreat you it may be as ſweet as it is gracious, and heal me if it may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thruſting your nails into my ſores. I deſire not to be left in my ill eſtate by flattery, but yet I deſire to be drawn out of it without rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; words alone ſeaſoned with ſweetneſs content me more than good deeds that are dry, and come from a proud hand. Be not therefore like the friends of <hi>Job,</hi> who reproached him in conforting him; but be compaſſionate a little to humane infirmities, and remember you cannot alter me, unleſs you new make me. I dare not ſay, that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the liberty of Deſarts before the magnificence of Courts; and that chains, though never ſo well made and guilded over, do yet not tempt me; I onely ſay, I know my ſelf too well to meddle in a trade where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I am not capable, and to begin a life which I muſt needs end, at the very beginning. Thus Sir, I do that out of conſideration which you think I do out of lazineſs, and the faintneſs of my ſpirit comes from that of my body. But I know it is impoſſible to perſwade you to this, and no means is left me to juſtifie my ſickneſs but by my death, and when you have loſt me, then you will finde and ſay I had reaſon to complain. In the mean time I underſtand that the Devils of <hi>Paris,</hi> of <hi>Bruxels, &amp;c.</hi> are not let looſe, and commit outrages upon me in four, or five languages. The contrary faction fortifies it ſelf dayly, and there ſeems to be merit and piety in tearing aſunder my reputation. Leave me not therefore to adverſaries ſo incenſed, and add not your rigour to their cruelty. I conjure you to take ſome care of an afflicted Soul, if I have defects, ſupply them by your virtue; if I be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in my affairs, be you my tutour, but exact no more of me than nature hath given me. You are too generous to put back a man that caſts himſelf between your arms; and one that is more than any other in the World,</p>

                     <p>I Have heard of the happy accompliſhment of your marriage; and that it hath been one of the great ſolemnities of <hi>Rochell.</hi> I have celebrated it here in my particular; with leſs pomp indeed and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult; but with as much joy, and ſatisfaction of minde, as they that ſung the <hi>Hymonaeus.</hi> Though perhaps you would not have it ſo; yet your contentments are mine; you have not any paſſion ſo proper to your ſelf, which is not common with me, and play the cruel, as long as you will, I will have a ſhare in that which is yours; even then when you will not affoard to give it me. At the worſt, I will love you ſtill, as I have ever done, as a creature ſupreamly excellent; though not ſupreamly juſt: As there are ſome virtues that are fierce; and ſcornfull; ſo there are ſome ſciences which have attractives amidſt their difficulties, and which draw us on in thruſting us back: You are like theſe abſtract knowledges: Your merit ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens all your rigours: and how hard ſoever the perſecution hath been, which I have ſuffered: yet I vow unto you, I could never finde in my heart to hate the Tyrant. I have ſtill ſo great a care of his reputation, that I would not be thought innocent; for fear he ſhould be blamed to have done me wrong; and I had rather be a Prevaricatour, and treacherous to my ſelf, than to ſeem I had cauſe of complaint againſt him. We ought to condemne the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this diſorder; and to ſuppreſs this unfortunate <hi>Olympiade.</hi> We ought to perſwade our imagination, that the matter is not ſo indeed; but that it is onely dreamt. When you ſhall pleaſe to remember your words; I ſhall ſee your Verſes; and your friends Sermons. In the mean time Sir, if you will not have it be a meer liberality; I ſend you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to exerciſe commutative juſtice, and begin a traffick whereof the Toll is not agreed upon to be taken of right. Never was a man ſo miſerably buſied as my ſelf; I am intricated with an infinite number of petty affairs: which, as you know, are no leſs cumberſom than the great: One thruſt of a ſword hurts not ſo much as a hundred pricks of a

                     <p>THe day I parted from <hi>Paris;</hi> I dreamt not of taking any journey; but a news which I received, made me take Horſe within an hour after I received it. This is that which hindred me from taking my leave; and to uſe ſuch compliments with you, as in ſuch caſes are accuſtomed. If I did not know you to be an enemy of the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Ceremonies; and that you, as well as my ſelf, cut off from friendſhip all vain pomp and ſuperfluities, I ſhould ſtudy for long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes to juſtifie my journey: but in ſo doing, I ſhould offer wrong to a wiſe man; to think he had opinions like the vulgar: and that he would not either give, or take ſo good a thing as liberty. I enjoy it as I would wiſh within theſe three, or four dayes; and I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it at the Bank of the River where I left it the laſt year. I ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh from my minde all thoughts of the ſtreet Saint <hi>Jaques;</hi> and dream not either of my Prince, or Common-wealth, either of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies books, or of my own: I dream, to ſay true, continually of you; and finde no image in my memory ſo pleaſing, as that which preſents me the time of our being together. I would willingly employ <hi>Atlante,</hi> or <hi>Meliſſe,</hi> to procure me a more ſolid content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and to convey you and your Library hither in a night. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forget this dear retreat of your repoſe; for, I know, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, you would finde even in <hi>Tryvolie,</hi> a want in your felicity; and that without your books, our fruits would be but ſour; and our good cheer but of ill taſte unto you. Theſe are imaginations Sir, with which I flatter my ſelf; whileſt I ſtand waiting to return to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi> that I may there go finde out a happineſs which cannot come hither to finde out me. If in the mean time you pleaſe to ſend me ſome news, whereof, you know provincial ſpirits are extreamly gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; you ſhall give me means, to make a whole Countrey beholding

In theſe, I require not the ſtrains of your underſtanding, nor the politick Animadverſions which come from this accurate, and Collineant judgement, (to uſe the barbarous eloquence of our friend) it ſhall be enough for me that I may know in general ſome part of that which paſſeth, and may have ſome Epitome of the Hiſtory which you ſend weekly to Mounſieur <hi>d'Andilly.</hi> I humbly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, to aſſure him that I honour him continually with paſſion; and aſſure your ſelf alſo, that I am</p>

His Letters ſpeak nothing but of your converſations, and of your feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; news which he ſends me, rather to brave me, and to ſet me in a longing, than to give any part in his good fortune, and to juſtifie his ſtay at <hi>Paris.</hi> I ſhall one day have means to be revenged of him for this malice: I doubt not to have liberty to walk abroad, when he ſhall be tied to ſtay at home; and to have my turn in feaſting and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king merry, when he ſhall ſtand waiting upon enterrements, and go exhorting men that are to be hanged. Yet he is all this while your Favorite in my abſence, though he need not think me abſent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he will; for if he love me enough, to be troubled for loſing me, he may eaſily recover me, by looking upon your face. This reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between you and me, is not the leaſt of my vanities; and I vow unto you, I am proud of it in the higheſt degree: every day I thank my Mother for it in my heart; and do a ſecret homage for it to Nature. It were enough for me, to be taken for your Coppy; but my gray hairs tell me to my ſhame, that I am rather your Original, and put me in minde of this untoward advantage. I ſhould not do much good, to paint them, unleſs withall, I could diſcharge the penſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that hath changed them: for the tincture of this blots out all other. It is fit therefore to be merry, and to baniſh ſorrow, ſeeing this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this goodly reſolution ſtands in need of you; my joy would be perfect, if you would ſometimes be a man of the Province; and that there were any appearance of hope, to ſee you at <hi>Condeville.</hi> I know no reaſon you ſhould ſcorn an Iſland, in which our <hi>Arioſto</hi> would have charmed his deareſt <hi>Herces;</hi> and whereof he would have made a thouſand other ſtrange deviſes, if he had been able to diſcover it.

                     <p>MY dear Couſin, the beginning of your Letter had frighted me, and I was taking Alarum at theſe words of death and Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, but I recovered my ſpirits when I ſaw the firſt had failed of his blow, and that you uſe not the other but to ſtrengthen you in an eſtate they have already put you; ſuch dayes as this will prove more healthfull to you than all their Drugs, and the ſweetneſs, which begins to ſpring from the purity of the Elements, is the onely Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine that heals without corrupting, and cleanſeth without waſting. For my ſelf I think not of dying when I have once gotten <hi>March</hi> over my head, and me thinks I finde my ſelf renewed at the onely ſmelling of the Violets. I make uſe of them to more than one ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, they ſerve me for Broths as well as for Noſegayes. I cannot be perſwaded that cold purgeth the Air, or drives away ſickneſs; and I am glad at heart to hear the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> is dead of the Purples in the moneth of <hi>January,</hi> and that in <hi>Germanie.</hi> At leaſt this will juſtifie the Summer and the hot Countreys, and will ſerve us for a proof againſt — when according to his cuſtom he will plead our adverſaries cauſe. I am more than I thought I was; ſeeing you aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure me that I am ſometimes the ſubject of our conferences; and though in this you run the hazard of being in the number of thoſe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:120345:134"/>
Oratours, who were blamed for making ill choiſe of their ſubjects; yet pardon me if I account the teſtimony of your remembring me, more dear unto me than the glorie of your well ſpeaking; and if I like rather you ſhould talk of my idleneſs and of my walks, than to diſcourſe of publick affairs, or voyages of Princes. I regard not the eſtimation of the people, I would give a great deal to buy out that with which I have gotten it; but there are certain friendſhips upon which onely I rely, and to be razed out of all accounts in the ſtate would be leſs grievous to me than to be blotted out of your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. Continue therefore theſe conferences which are ſo pleaſing to me, and of which I am in ſpirit a partaker, or rather deny me not theſe conſolations which are ſo ſweet unto me, and whoſe effect I feel a hundred miles off. I cannot diſſemble the need I have of you, I could not live if you did not love me, but withall you could love a man who is more paſſionately than I am</p>

Things that wounded me hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the very heart, do not now ſo much as ſuperficially touch me; that which I accounted as my own is now become a ſtranger to me, and my heart is hardned againſt all accidents that happen, if they concern not either my ſelf, or my friends. It is true the death of — wrought in me ſome compaſſion; I can never hate men that are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie, and it grieves me that cowardice ſhould triumph over ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and the lazie cauſe the valiant to be murthered. For this man it would not ſerve to take him at table, it was neceſſary to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him; for elſe the moſt reſolute of the conſpiratours would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have had the courage to do the act, would never have abidden the ſplendor of that terrible countenance, and would have thought he had alwayes heard this voice.</p>

                     <p>MY dear Couſin, I mean not to ſhew your Letter to the Doctour that brought it to me, it would make him loſe that little hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility that is left him, and he would think himſelf already <hi>In ſtatu perfection is acquiſitae;</hi> you do not well to uſe him as he were ſome rare perſonage, it is the way to ſpoil him altogether, and to harden a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which durſt not otherwiſe ſhew it ſelf. I ſhall have ſomething to do to make him come to himſelf, and to take down the ſwelling of his ſpirit, which your teſtimony hath put him into. It is an eaſier matter to corrupt than to reform the good works more ſlowly than the evil; and I much fear my remedies will not be ſo forcible as your poyſon; Under this name auſtere Philoſophers would compriſe the Preſent you have ſent me. They conceive that perfumes are made of ſweet and pleaſing poyſons, and that if they make no impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the body, they yet effeminate the vigour of the minde: For my ſelf I ſpeak no ſuch harſh language, but content my ſelf to ſay with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſter man than they: <hi>Curſed be theſe Effeminate perſons that have cried down ſo innocent and ſo good a thing.</hi> The uſe of it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the exceſs is forbidden; I know the firſt, and you would caſt me upon the other. For to ſpeak truely what good can come of ſo
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:120345:135"/>
exorbitant a liberality? and what means this abundance of Orenge flower water with which you have loaded our Meſſenger? you would not have ſent me a greater quantity of this water, if where you are, men had rained a great ſhowre of it: and let this be ſpoken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hyperbole; and without putting me upon the high ſtrain. Your good deeds have no ſpice of the preſent poverty, one may ſee in them the abundance of the golden age, and an image of that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py time of which a Poet writes; <hi>They powred out by Flouds what they give now by drops;</hi> yet you have done well to get before hand; hereafter the ſumptuary Laws will not ſuffer you to be ſo liberal; and you are threatned with the coming forth of a Proclamation that will bring things back to the ancient frugality of our anceſtours. Perfumes ſhall not be uſed but in Temples, and about the ſacrifices at great feſtivals, nor biſkes —; but about the Pallace, or at the <hi>Kings</hi> Coronation; ſo that you ſhall learn the virtue of moderation by a leſſon from the Prince, and you ſhall be made a good huſband if you will not be a bad Cittizen.

You know Sir, that in our commerce I contribute nothing but my Docibleneſs, and my ears; I am the people and you the Theater; I mean a Theater reaſonable and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, inſpired with ſentences &amp; inſtructions, to whoſe audience I would run from one end of the World to another, and never complain of my pains nor of my journey. I would not onely return you your viſit in <hi>Tourain;</hi> but to hear you would do much more, and go much further, willingly untertake as long a voyage as <hi>Appollonius</hi> did, who travailed many Kingdoms, and paſſed many Seas, onely to ſee <hi>Ia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Your <hi>Indian</hi> viſage and your yellow colour make ſhew of a <hi>Gymnoſophiſt;</hi> but <hi>Gymnoſophiſts</hi> had not the virtue that lies hidden under this yellowneſs; for though they made Trees to ſpeak, and ſent tempeſts on their errands, where they pleaſed, yet theſe were effects of their Devilliſh arts, and no arguments of their wiſdom. Yours is not onely more humane and more Lawfull; but is uſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with leſs pride and leſs violence. Inſtead of filling the eyes with unprofitable wonders, it makes to flow and ſtream in the Soul neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary verities; it doth not aſtoniſh me with prodiges, nor affright me with Thunder, but it perſwades me to do that I ought to do, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs me to know that I ought to know. It is the ſame I think that appeared under the Empire of <hi>Trajan;</hi> and communicated it ſelf to men by the mediation of <hi>Plutarch.</hi> How have you decked her without diſarming her? how ſweetned her countenance without weakning her force? how covered her Bones and Muſcles with a fair fleſh, and made her a body of a Carkaſs? The Syllogiſme, which by the ſaying of a <hi>Grecian</hi> is the <hi>Trident</hi> and <hi>Mace</hi> of Philoſophy, is in your writings all painted and perfumed: After you have purged it from the ruſt of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and from the poyſon of Sophiſters, you make with it a wholeſom and delightfull lancing, and no man ſeeks to ward your blows, becauſe they heal and tickle. With theſe rare knowledges you ſhould entertain your friends, and not with the fruits of our Orchard, nor with thoſe of my ſtudies, which are as vulgar the one as the other; But yet ſeeing they pleaſe your taſte, and that you demand of me particularly the laſt piece you ſaw of my making, I have intreated — who carries it to <hi>Paris</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver

But I durſt not be ſo bold at the Court, where there is no longer any favour for naughty words, nor ſafety for innovatours of our language. Remember therefore that I ſpeak under <hi>Benedicite,</hi> and in our moſt ſtrait confidence; and imitate herein that <hi>Queen,</hi> who in publick called her Son by the name of her Huſband, but in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate by the name of her favorite; much after this ſort do I; having conceived my work from the acquaintance I have with the Latin; I let it in truth carry a <hi>French</hi> title, but in ſecret and ſpeaking in the ear I give it the name of his Father. It is now three moneths that M. <hi>de Nants</hi> hath been in <hi>Britanie,</hi> and M. <hi>de Tholouze</hi> in <hi>Languedoc.</hi> Upon the firſt opportunity I will not fail to ſend them your rare Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, and let them know in what height of account you hold them both. Do me the like office to Mounſieur <hi>Bourdelot,</hi> and aſſure him that I have great pretenſions upon his learning, and that I ground my ſelf much upon his honeſty. Hereafter one of them ſhall be my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the neceſſities of my ſpirit, the other my ſanctuary againſt the malice of the World. For you Sir, it is impoſſible for me to expreſs the high opinion I conceive of you; when the queſtion is to ſpeak of your virtue, I cannot finde words that give me ſatisfaction, and therefore at this time you ſhall have from me but the common concluſion of all my Letters, that I am</p>

                     <p>YOur Letter hath ſtayed here a long time for me; if I had been here at its firſt arrival, I had ſooner teſtified to you the joy with which I received it: and the eſpecial account I make of the meaneſt of your favours, I ſeek not after new acquaintance; I had rather I could forgo one half of thoſe I have already but for yours; I vow unto you I have much deſired it, and you had attractives for me, even in the Melancholy of my <hi>Quartan</hi> Ague. I diſcovered a great worth under the veil of your diſvaluing your ſelf; and ſaw well, that you
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:120345:137"/>
ſought rather to go ſafely and ſolidly, than to go in pomp and ſtate; and had more care to nouriſh your minde, than to ſet it out in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. I do not therefore take you for a ſimple Captain of <hi>Holland,</hi> who takes nothing but Stoccadoes; and Circumvallation; and ſtudies ſuch other words in that Countrey, to come afterwards and fright us with them here in <hi>France.</hi> I know you poſſeſs no leſs the virtues of peace, than thoſe that make a noiſe and handle iron: and that you are a man of the Library, as well as of the Arſenal. Mounſieur <hi>Huggens,</hi> I aſſure my ſelf, is of the ſame minde; and I doubt not, but having obſerved you in both theſe kindes, he reliſheth as well your ſpirit, as he values your courage. I am very glad of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence that is between you; of which, if you pleaſe, I ſhall make uſe hereafter, for the ſafety of our Commerce. But Sir, I have another, more important requeſt to make unto you; and I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly entreat you to do for me, with my Lord —: the good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, which I have right to hope your goodneſs will afford me. It hath been written to me from <hi>Paris,</hi> that he had ſome ſiniſter conceit of me; and indeed the coldneſs of his countenance, the laſt time I had the honour to do him reverence, ſeemed to ſhew as much. This misfortune comes not to me by any fault of mine: for I ſwear unto you Sir, that I have alwayes carried towards him a moſt religious reſpect; and have never ſpoken of him, but as of a man of very extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parts. It muſt needs be, that this is ſome rellick of thoſe impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which — hath left in him: and that he judgeth of me by the report of my Enemies. I will not move queſtions againſt the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a dead man; nor blame the paſſion of a great worthy. There have been ſome moved with motives leſs reaſonable, that have wept for their Dogs; and built Tombs for beaſts they loved. In that, I acknowledge the good fortune of —: but you know better than any other what his honeſty was: and you ought upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to give your uttermoſt Teſtimony in behalf of calumniated innocency.

                     </opener>
                     <p>I Have received in one Packet, a Letter from you, of the four and twentieth of <hi>March;</hi> and another from Mounſieur <hi>Huggens</hi> of the fifteenth of <hi>December.</hi> I give you a thouſand thanks for each of them; and complain not, that I ſtayed a while for the latter, ſeeing if it had come a readier way, it had perhaps not come ſo ſafe a way: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contains it any news, whereof the knowledge might not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born without any danger: no matter in it, that either concerns the life of the Prince, or the good of the ſtate. It might have come time enough, ten years hence; for it ſpeaks of nothing but of <hi>Kings</hi> and Common-wealths, that have been long ago. Our commerce hath no object, but our books; and I have no reaſon to complain of a ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that does a favour to my negligence. But my good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, — ſuffers me to be idle no longer; ſhe will have me here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after make uſe of her meſſengers; and by conſequent, eaſe you of your conveying them. Yet for my part, I exempt you not altogether, but if you return into <hi>Holland,</hi> at the time you have appointed; you ſhall do me the favour to remember the note I ſend you. I intreat you alſo to demand of our friends in that Countrey, what reaſon they have to bring into our language a new faſhion of ſpeaking; and which by the communication you have with them, is gotten into the Letter you ſent me. If you ſay, my Maſters the States; you may as well ſay, Mounſieur the Councel; and Madam the Aſſembly: and more than this; if many Senatours that make the body of a Republick, may be called my Maſters the States, then every Senatour, which makes a part of that body, may be called Mounſieur the State: and if this be ſuffered, the moſt ſtrange opinions of — ſhall be authoriſed by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick uſe: of the ſame words will be made another language, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this it cannot be thought ſtrange, that — ſhould ſpeak of the <hi>Seigneurie</hi> of <hi>Venice;</hi> as of the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugal;</hi> and that ſhe ſhould marry with Mounſieur the <hi>Kings</hi> brother. It is true the league com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the like incongruity when it gave the Duke <hi>de Main,</hi> the Title of Lieutenant of the State, and Crown of <hi>France,</hi> but this was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a check: you know what ſport the <hi>Catholicon</hi> makes at it; and with what force he defends at once, both the rights of the Kingdom, and the Laws of Grammar. And where the ſame Authour in another place, calls the Aſſembly, which was held at <hi>Paris;</hi> My Lords the States; he did that but to make it ridiculous; &amp; not with meaning to ſpeak regularly:
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:120345:138"/>
Our dear friends may make of a little Citie, a great; but of a bad word they cannot make a good: and though their liberty extend very far, yet it reacheth not to licenſe Barbariſm. Mounſieur <hi>Huggens</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of this point; and if in propounding to the Councel ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a matter, he ſhall ſpeed well; he ſhall have the honour to purge his Countrey of a vitious phraſe, as much in the judgement of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians, as to free it from a <hi>Hidra,</hi> or <hi>Chymaera,</hi> and therein ſhall ſhew himſelf a <hi>Hercules,</hi> or a <hi>Bellerophon.</hi> This is a way I take with my friends, to make my ſelf laugh; becauſe I am given to penſiveneſs when I am alone; and I cannot ſtir up any Joy in me, but by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, at leaſt the repreſentation of ſome perſon, which is both dear unto me, and choſen for the nonce: of this number Sir, you are, and know well, that I am</p>

God hath now a kinde of intereſt in preſerving it; ſeeing you have conſecrated it to him; and your life is vowed to a perpetual Meditation of his Myſteries. I doubt not of his bleſſing this your holy deſire; and look at my return to finde a great Preacher under your Caſſock. You will ſhew me as many Homilies, as heretofore you have ſhewed me Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets: and inſtead of <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> and <hi>Permeſſa;</hi> you will ſpeak of <hi>Sion,</hi> and of <hi>Siloe.</hi> Yet moderate your ſelf a little at firſt: and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in a ſtrange Countrey. I would not have you dive too deep into the Abyſſes of Predeſtination; famous for the ſhipwracks of ſo many Pilots; or to ſpeak more plainly, for the Hereſies of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Doctours. If you will take my counſel, you ſhall let the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> and the <hi>Jacobins</hi> fight it out between themſelves about the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion <hi>De Auxiliis;</hi> and never meddle amongſt them, nor go about to part them. The often uſing of Syllogiſmes is very dangerous for health; there is nothing that heats the bloud, or enflames Choler more then Diſputation. Beſides, though you make your ſelf hoarſe with ſpeaking for the Truth, and make it never ſo plain: yet you ſhall never make your adverſary to confeſs it; or ever be able to take hold

                     <p>I Pitty your good fortune, the Court that follows you at your Chamber would be to me an unſupportable honour, who would not give my Mornings for all the Complements of <hi>Paris.</hi> It is the flower and prime of the day that is taken from you; it is the time of Meditation and Prayer which flattery intrudes upon. There is no Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditour nor Sergeant that you might not deal withall better cheap than with theſe troubleſom friends. You are unfortunate to be ſo beloved, and a man of whom ſo many other have uſe, can be of little, or no uſe to himſelf. It is better yet to paſs for a Clown, than thus to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute ones ſelf by civility, and better never to ſacrifice to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, than to make ones ſelf the beaſt for the Sacrifice. You would perhaps intermit this courſe, but the time is paſt for that; a breach would draw upon you a War; and you would run the fortune of that poor Saint, who was murthered with pricks of Pen-knives, and cut in pieces by his Schollers. You would be the object of a Rhetorical, an Hiſtorical and a Poetical perſecution; and the muſes, which now court you, would grow furious, and fall a tearing you, ſo that you have

This back-door whereof you have ſent me a Platform, is in truth an excellent invention, but this will preſently be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and you will gain nothing by it, but to be beſieged in more places at once. Do better Sir, quit the place that is not tenable, and come ſave your ſelf at — I am not ſo poor, but I can make you a reſemblance at leaſt of the good cheer of <hi>Paris,</hi> and furniſh you with innocent pleaſures, ſuch as Philoſophy and Prieſthood will allow of; It ſhall be for as ſhort a time as you pleaſe; and onely to make an ill cuſtom take another courſe.

Let him but tell me my faults, and ſee how quickly I will mend them; let him but ſay, what it is in my ſtile that offends him; and ſee how ready I ſhall be to give him ſatisfaction. If my <hi>Hyperboles</hi> diſpleaſe him; I will blot them out of my Letters the next time they are printed; I will truely confeſs all I have ever uſed, and make a ſolemne vow never to uſe more. Yet it cannot be truely ſaid; that to uſe this Figure; is a matter that deſerves blame; for, not to ſpeak of humane Authours, we ſhould then blame the Son of God; for ſaying. <hi>It is eaſier for a Cammel to go through a needles eye, than for a rich man to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of heaven.</hi> But I will not ſeek to ſave my ſelf by ſo ſupream an authority: In this, I will reſpect our Saviour, but not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him; I will believe that ſuch examples are far above all humane imitation; and will not attempt it no more than to walk upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to go forty dayes without eating. In good earneſt, I would do any thing to give contentment to a man that gives contentment to M. the Cardinal; and hath perſwaded the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Sweden.</hi> If he will play the Tyrant with thoſe that ſeek his favour, let him; I refuſe not hence forward the hardeſt conditions he can lay upon me; and to gain his protection; I renounce with all my heart my very liberty: It is now four and twenty hours ſince I laid my eyes together; It is time therefore that I bid you good morrow, or good night; take which of them you pleaſe; and believe me alwayes,</p>

                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>YOu know I have fed upon the fruits of <hi>Pomponne,</hi> even beyond the rules of temperance; and I told you there that they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally excellent; yet I now eſpecially declare my ſelf, in favour of the laſt you ſent me, and finde them, far ſurpaſſing the Amber Pear, or all other kindes, which I cannot name. It is true, I affect eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Tree it ſelf that bears them: and I account the meaneſt of the Leaves, no meaner than Jewels: yet their own goodneſs is ſuch, that though they grew in the Garden of —: or grew upon a ſtock that Father —: had planted; yet I ſhould not for all that, but high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteem them, and take a pleaſure in their taſte. In a word, to leave ſpeaking in Allegory, and not to flounder my ſelf in a Figure, into which you have moſt maliciouſly caſt me: I ſay Sir, that in all your Preſents, I ſee nothing but excellent; and leaſt you ſhould think, I meant to exempt my ſelf from giving a particular account of my judgement, by ſpeaking in general terms: I let you know, that in the firſt place, the two lines ſpoken of at the end of the diſcourſe, pleaſe me infinitely; and next to this that place which is written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion 
of —: that <hi>France</hi> is too good a Mother to rejoyce in the loſs of her Children; and that the victories gotten upon our ſelves, are fit to wear mourning, and be covered with black vails. All that could have been ſaid upon this Argument, would never have been comparable to this ingenious ſilence. And as he hath dexterouſly ſhunned a paſſage ſo tender, ſo he enters as bravely, and as proudly upon a matter that will bear it; when ſpeaking of —: he ſaith, that having overcome the waves and the windes, that oppoſed his paſſage, and traverſed the fires of ſo many Canons of the Enemies; with a few poor Barks, he made his way through a Forreſt of great ſhips, and deſpiſing all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces, made a ſmall Iſland to be the Grave of the glorie of that great Queen of the Northern Iſlands. And a little after; where he ſaith: that God, who beſtows his favours upon Nations, by meaſure; ſeeing, that the admirable valour of ours, would eaſily Conquer the whole World; if it had Prudence equal to its cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, ſeems therefore to have given us, as a Counterpoiſe to the greatneſs of our ſpirits; a kinde of impetuoſity and impatience, which to our Armies have oftentimes been fatal, and cauſe of ruine. But that now the caſe is altered in this point: that now the <hi>French</hi> are
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:120345:140"/>
onely <hi>French</hi> in the Courage and Valour; that theſe Lions are grown reaſonable; and now, to the ſtrength and courage of the North; they joyn the prudence and ſtayedneſs of the South, &amp;c. Alſo where he ſaith, that the carriage at <hi>Cazal,</hi> is a thing incomprehenſible; and for which we muſt be fain to look out ſome new name; for it cannot be called a Siege, ſeeing the place was ſurrendred before ever it was battered: nor it cannot be called a battel, ſeeing no man ſtrook a ſtroak: nor it cannot be called a Treaty, ſeeing Treaties are not made with Weapons in hand, &amp;c. But that which pleaſeth me moſt of all, becauſe it toucheth indeed the ſtring of my own inclination; is that which he ſpeaks of the Marqueſs of <hi>Rambovillet:</hi> that there had been Statues erected in honour of her virtue; if ſhe had fortuned to be born in the beginning of her race. For, as you know Sir, this illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Woman, is of <hi>Romane</hi> ſtock; <hi>Et de Gente Sabella;</hi> of which <hi>Virgil</hi> ſpeaks. Theſe are the paſſages I can call to minde, having not the Originals by me: being taken from me, by a neighbouring Lady; who affects the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Sweden</hi> with the like paſſion, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Rambovillet,</hi> if I durſt diſcover my ſelf therein; they ſhould both know how I do concurre with them, ſo eminent a virtue may chaſtely enough be loved of both Sexes; and let the ſlanderous Hiſtory ſpeak its pleaſure; I for my part think no otherwiſe of it, than as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> loved <hi>Salomon:</hi> and as <hi>Nicomedes</hi> loved <hi>Caeſar.</hi> I had begun ſomething for the Triumph of this great Prince, but his death made my Pen fall out of my hand; and therefore you are like to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from me at this time in revenge of your Sonnet. For your <hi>French</hi> Proſe, I ſend you another, which I will never believe to be Latin, untill — ſhall aſſure you, it is; to whom I intreat you to ſhew it from me: <hi>Vir plane cum Antiquitate conferendus, &amp; qui mihi eſt in hoc genere, unus curia, Cenſor &amp; Quirites.</hi> I have read many things of his with infinite ſatisfaction: but I know, he hath certain miſeries in his writing, which he lets not common people know; and — hath told me of a continuation he hath written, of the Hiſtory of M. <hi>de Thou;</hi> which is not imparted but to his ſpecial friends; and which, I am infinitely deſirous to ſee: but I am not a man that will enter by force upon any mans ſecrets: and my diſcretion in ſuch caſes, ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes greater than my curioſity, <hi>Optare licebit, ſi potiri non licet,</hi> If I ſhould not preſently make an end of my Letter, I ſhould kill you with Latin; for I finde my ſelf in an humour that way; and in this deſert where I live: I have no commerce, but wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THe time which my malady permits me, I beſtow upon you, and make uſe of the reſpite of my fits, to tell you, I have received your laſt Letters, and the new aſſurances of your friendſhip: which is ſo much the dearer unto me, becauſe I know you uſe them with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion; and that there be not many things you greatly affect. This makes for my glory, that I can pleaſe ſo dainty a taſte; and that I can get good from one that is ſo covetous. It is no ſmall matter to draw a wiſe man out of himſelf; and to make Philoſophy compaſſionate of others evils. Although the place, to which ſhe hath raiſed you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more eminent, nor more ſure; yet my diſgraces may be cauſe that her proſpect is not ſo fair, or pleaſant: and how ſetled ſoever the peace of your minde be, yet the Object of a perſecuted friend, may perhaps offend your eyes. Our Mounſieur <hi>de Berville,</hi> I aſſure my ſelf, diſlikes not this kinde of wiſdom: he likes to have that huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dreſſed, which <hi>Zeno</hi> would have to be rooted out; he knows
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:120345:142"/>
that magnanimity hath its reſidence between effeminateneſs and cruelty; and that the ſweet and humane virtues, have place between the Fierce and the Heroick. Poets ſometimes make the Demy Gods to weep; and if an old womans death were cauſe enough to make <hi>Aeneas</hi> ſhed tears; the oppreſſion of one innocent, cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of your ſighes. Yet I require from you, none of theſe ſad of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: your onely countenance is enough to give me comfort. I do not live, but in the hope I have to ſee it, and to get you to ſwear once again in preſence of the fair <hi>Agnes,</hi> and the reſt of your Chamber Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinities, that you love me ſtill. After that, if you will have us make a voyage in your Abby, I ſhall eaſily condiſcend: Provided Sir, that you promiſe me ſafety amongſt your Monks: and that they be none of thoſe who profeſs exquiſite words: and onely talk of <hi>Analyſis</hi> and <hi>Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeal.</hi> If you have any that be of this humour, you are an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Abbot; and you may make account to be never without ſuites. Firſt, they will aſk you a double allowance: next they will queſtion your Revenew; and if you chance by ill hap to make a Book, you are ſure to be preſently cited before the Inquiſition; or at leaſt before the Sorbon.

                     <p>YOu cannot complain, nor be in miſery by your ſelf alone: I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of all your good and evil, and feel ſo lively a reflection of them, that there needs but one blow to make two wounds. And thus I am wounded by the news you write, and though your grief he not altogether juſt, yet it is ſufficient to make me partake with you, that it is yours. We weep for one not onely whom we knew not, but whom we know to be happy: one that in ſix months ſtaying in the World hath gained that, which St. <hi>Anthony</hi> was afraid to loſe after three ſcore years pennance in the wilderneſs. I wiſh I could have had the like favour; and have died at the time, when I was innocent: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf, neither valiant nor ambitious, I account thoſe wars the beſt that are the ſhorteſt; and that, though in Paradiſe there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers degrees; and divers manſions; yet there is not any that is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent good. Conſerve onely your goodly maker of Saints, and you ſhall finde ſome of all ſorts; I mean of the one, and the other Sex: Religious and Seculars, <hi>Gaſcoignes</hi> and <hi>French.</hi> You know well, I
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:120345:143"/>
have appointed you here a Chamber; and that you are my debtor of a viſite, now a whole year, if you be a man of your word; but I fear me you are not, and that as your cuſtom is, you will content your ſelf with praiſing my quiet courſe of life; yet I would have you to flatter at leaſt my ſpirit, though it be, but with ſome light hope of ſo perfect a contentment: promiſe me you will come, and make me happy; though you break your promiſe, I ſhall enjoy at leaſt, ſo much of good; and in doing ſo, you ſhall amuſe me, though you do not ſatisfie me. I ſend you all I have of that admirable <hi>Incognito;</hi> of whom there is ſo much talk, and who hath made himſelf famous now theſe three years, under the name of <hi>Petrus Aurelius:</hi> I cannot for my life finde who he is. Mounſieur <hi>de Filſac,</hi> told me lately at <hi>Paris,</hi> that of him that brought the leaves to Printing, he could not poſſibly learn any more than this, that he was a man, who deſires to ſerve God inviſibly. And in truth, if you knew in what ſort he carries his ſecrecy; and with what care and cunning he hides himſelf; you would confeſs he takes more pains to ſhun reputation, than ambitious men take in running after it. For from being a Plagiary, to rob others of their glory, who refuſeth that which is his own, and ſuffers a Phantaſme, to receive thoſe accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and praiſes which belong to himſelf. This is no man of the common mould; even in the judgement of his adverſaries; and his writings ſavour not the compoſitions of this age. They are animated with the ſpirit and vigour of the former times; and repreſent us a Church we never ſaw. Yet it ſeems in ſome paſſages, he hath leſs of Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> ſweetneſs than of Saint <hi>Hieroms</hi> choler; and that he is willinger to do that, which juſtice onely permits him, than that which charity counſels him. I could wiſh he had ſhewed a little more reſpect to the gray hairs, and rare merit of Father <hi>Sirmond;</hi> or rather that he would have dulled the edge of his Arms, and dealt with him in a gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler war. But there is no means to bridle a provoked valour, nor to guide a great force, though with a great moderation. All Saints are not of one temper; it is enough for Religion to cut off vices; and to purifie the paſſions. Our moral Divinity acknowledgeth ſome inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent cholers; and it is the beauty of Chriſts flock, that there be Lions amongſt the ſheep, and that as well the ſublimeſt and ſtrongeſt ſpirits as the baſeſt and ſweeteſt ſubmit and proſtrate themſelves to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſtianity. If I had learned nothing in his book but onely to know what reſpect men owe to a Character reverenced of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, I had not loſt my time in reading him. If Biſhops be Princes, and if their Dignity be equal or Superiour to <hi>Kings,</hi> ſhall we make any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, to call a Prelate, My Lord; and eſteem him leſs than a Grand of <hi>Spain,</hi> or than an Earle of <hi>England?</hi> You will tell me more of this at your next meeting; and I doubt not, ſetting aſide the intereſt of —

alwayes be meriting of thanks, why I ſhould not alwayes be craving new courteſies. The bearer of this Letter is my near Kinſman, yet our friendſhip is nearer, than our alliance, and the knot which Nature made, virtue hath tied. I humbly entreat your Lordſhip, to let him ſee you ſlight not things, whereof I make ſuch reckoning, and to do that for my ſake, which you would much willinger do for his own ſake, if he were known unto you. He is a man of mettal and ſpirit; and hath ſerved the <hi>King</hi> in this Province, having alſo had the honour to be in perſon before him in very famous actions. At this time, he is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled againſt all right and reaſon, and they that have drawn him from the exerciſe of his charge, to make him walk to <hi>Paris,</hi> have nothing to ſay, but that they do it of purpoſe to vex him. And therefore their manner of fight with him, is by flights and retreats, and they caſt ſo many bones of difficulty, between his Judges and him, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they ſhould ever come to any iſſue. They are not able to hinder his juſtification at laſt; but they are able to delay, and keep him off a long time. You Sir, may ſave him this long journey, and may break this Project that Calumny ſets on; if you pleaſe but to facilitate the overture, he will propoſe unto you, obtaining for him of — onely one quarter of an hours audience, I aſſure my ſelf, he will not be loath to hear him, being able to inform him of the ſtate of things in theſe parts; and which he will do faithfully, having thereof a ſpecial know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. You ſhall therefore my Lord, infinitely oblige him, to take him into your protection, and you may be pleaſed to remember, that it is your dear Son, that makes this requeſt unto you, one whom in the extaſie of your Fatherly affection, you have ſometimes called your glory; and the ornament of this age, who yet accounts no quality he hath ſo glorious, as that which he will never part with, whileſt he lives; to be</p>

Wherein I bind you not to a ſecond peruſall, and to read that againe, which perhaps you have read already with diſtaſt. It is true Sir, that ſomething is altered in the Copy, and well neere one halfe added to the Originall; but the ſpight is, that baſe Wares get no value by ſtore, and the water that comes from the ſame Spring, can never be much differing: but if in any of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, I have not altogether come off ill, and that I have had ſome tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable conceits, I acknowledge Sir, that I have had it all from the good education I had with you; and that it is the fruit of thoſe Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which you have done me the honour to impart unto me. For, no man ever had conceits more pure, more pregnant, than your ſelfe; no man ever ſaw things more cleerly than you doe; you can tell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely in what degree of good and evill any thing ſtands; and to find out the truth, there needs no more, but to follow your Opinion. But to ſpeake truly, I feare this quality in you, no leſſe than I eſteeme it; you have too much knowledge in you for a Diſcourſe that requires ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in the Reader. Neither am I ſo unadviſed, to expoſe it to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of your judgement, I ſubmit it rather to the protection of your goodneſſe, and hope you will not lay open thoſe faults, which none but your ſelfe ſhall ſee: Humbly entreating you to protect a ſpirit of your own making; and not ſo much to conſider my manner of expreſſing, as the affection with which I am</p>

For my ſelfe, who have ſeene wickedneſſe in its Triumph, and who have ſometime lived in the Countrey of ſubtlety and craft; I aſſure you, I have brought nothing from thence, but loathing and before ever I taſted it, was cloyed: I am exceeding glad to find you of the ſame diet, and doubt not of the Doctrine I Preach, ſeeing I read the ſame in your owne Letter; Believe it Sir, there is none more wholeſome, none more worthy of our Creation.

                     <p>SIR, I was upon the point of ſending my footman to you, when I ſaw your footman enter my Lodging, who brought me news ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding joyfull; and now I depend no longer upon Fortune, ſince another beſides her ſelf can make me happy; and am ſo indeed as much as I would wiſh, and ſhould never know the value of your friendſhip, if I made it not the bounds of my ambition. To complaine of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and to be your favorite, are things that imply a mortall contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: it is an eaſie matter to comfort a penſion ill paid, when a man is in poſſeſſion of ſtore of treaſure, and having neither the gift of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, nor of hypocriſie, it is not for me to proſper in an age which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme them moſt that are owners of theſe qualities. It is enough for me, that M. the Cardinall doth me the honour to wiſh me well, and condemnes not your judgement of me; all other diſgraces, from whence ſoever they come, I am prepared to beare, and take for a favour the contempt that is linked to the profeſſion of vertue. But it is too much to ſay of me, that which <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid to <hi>Cato: Catonem ſaeculum ſuum parùm intellexit.</hi> Theſe are tranſcendencies of Mr. <hi>de Nantes,</hi> and impoſtures of love. He ſtretcheth all objects to infinity, and all his compariſons are beyond proportion. The Sunne and the Starres are common things with him, and he can find noting in Nature godly enough to ſerve for a ſimilitude of that he loves. It is this deceitfull paſſion hath made you believe, that I am of ſome great worth, and that my barren ſoile is fruitfull in high conceits. But Sir, I count all this nothing, if this love of yours peſwade you not to come and ſtay a while in it, and to be mindfull of your word. I have put Monſieur — in hope hereof, and make my ſelfe ſure ſince you have made me a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne promiſe; knowing that Truth is reſident upon the mouth of Biſhops.</p>

If you will know the ſucceſſe, I can truly ſay, that all the company was well ſatisfied; but I may tell you all, that they were ever raviſhed with admiration of your bounty, ſpecially my Niece, who in the greateſt vanity, that ſex is capable of, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver durſt imagine ſhe ſhould ever have the honour to be prayſed in Latin, and ſhould ſerve for an Argument of commendation to the greateſt Doctor of our age.

And yet to theſe two favours, I can adde a third, which ſhe forgot: methinkes Sir, ſhee fattens and grows up with theſe prayſes you give her; ſhee is fairer by one halfe than ſhee was before. And if from vertue there iſſue certaine beames, which enlighten the Objects that are neere it; and that beauty flowes from goodneſſe, as from the Spring, I need not then goe farre to ſeeke from whence this varniſh of her looke, this amiableneſſe of her countenance, is growne upon her: It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly

It this be the price of ſo poore a marchandiſe, as that I ſent you, never was man a greater gainer by traffiking than I: and you ſeeme in this, not unlike thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> who thought to over-reach the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by giving them Gold for Glaſſe. I have long ſince knowne your great worth, though you would not be knowne to have ſuch worth in you; all the care you can take to hide the beauty of your life, cannot keep the luſtre of it from dazeling mine eyes, and though you make your vertue a ſecret, yet I have pierced into it, and diſcovered it. And yet I muſt confeſſe unto you my infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, I find it too ſublime for me, and with my uttermoſt ability am not able to reach it; all I can doe, is to reſpect it with reverence, and to follow you with my eyes and thoughts. The World cannot raiſe it ſelfe above the pitch of the preſent age, and be wiſe in equall rank with <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and <hi>Socrates;</hi> I am contented to be in a lower forme of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, for I am a man, and they demy Gods, I neither aſpire to be their equall, nor their rivall, much leſſe Sir, to be their judge or accuſer. <hi>Anitus</hi> and <hi>Melitus</hi> would be much miſtaken in me, if they ſhould think I would joyne with them in their accuſation, as though I thought all opinions to be bad, which are not like mine own, I had rather think, that it is I that loſe the ſight of <hi>Orafius Tubero</hi> ſometimes, than thinke that he is ſtrayed, or out of the way; and rather charge my ſelfe with weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, than accuſe him of raſhneſſe.

Indeed, as long as you were taken up with enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining your deare ſonne, whom long abſence had made, as it were new unto you, and as long as you were taſting the firſt joyes which his returne had brought with it; It had been a great indiſcretion in a ſtranger, to intrude himſelfe into your private feaſt, and trouble the liberty of your familiar converſation, but now that your extaſies of joy are over-paſſed, and that a more calme eſtate makes you ſociable to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers abroad: Now Madam, you may vouchſafe to accept my comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to heare me ſay, with my Countrey freedome, that you want much of that I wiſh you, if you want any thing of abſolute felicity. I make no doubt but Monſieur <hi>Bourbillier</hi> your ſonne, as he parted from hence a right honeſt man, ſo he is turned hither an underſtanding man; and that to the lights, which are given by Nature, he hath added thoſe that are gotten by practice, and by conference.

You remember, that but hearing her Name, I fell down in a trance, and that the very ſight of her livery, ſtruck into me a religious horrour, and a trembling reſpect, which is not borne, but to things Divine. And in this ranke, I place ſo rare a beauty as hers is; and though I be no man of the World, yet I am not ſo very a ſtranger to the occurrents of the World, but that I very well know, ſhe is univerſally adored; I muſt not alwayes paſſe for an Hermite; this I am ſure, ſhe carries with her the deſires and vowes of all the Court, and ſhee leads in triumph thoſe Gallants, who have themſelves triumphed over our enemies: yet I know withall, they depend more upon her by their own paſſion, than by her endeavours, and follow without being drawne. Theſe are Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, whom ſhe truſts upon their word, for their true impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and whom ſhe ſuffers to be their owne Keepers. In the courſe ſhe holds of honeſty, her favours are ſo morall, or ſo light, that either they content none but the wiſe, becauſe they deſire no more than what is given them; or none but the unwiſe, becauſe they take that to be given them, which was never meant them; ſo there are ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps well ſatisfied, but it is by the force of their imagination, and no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath cauſe to be proud of a Fortune, which no body poſſeſſeth. As her vertue is as cleare as the fire that ſparkles in her eyes, ſo her reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:120345:151"/>
is as much without blemiſh as her beauty; and of this, honeſt people give teſtimony by their words, and Detractors by their ſilence. Shee makes thornes that they cannot prick, and makes ſlander it ſelfe to learne good manners. And therefore Sir, I ſhould be very unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, it I had been cauſe of diſpleaſing her, whom all the World en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to pleaſe; and it would be a ſhame to our Nation, that a <hi>Frenchman</hi> ſhould beare himſelfe unreverently towards her, to whom very <hi>Barbarians</hi> would beare a reverence. If this miſ-fortune had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen me, it is not the ſaving my Pages life, ſhould make me ſtand in the defence; and I would never deſire to augment my traine, but to the end I might have the more ſacrifices to offer upon the Altar of her choler. But ſhe is too mercifull to puniſh mean Delinquents, and too generous, to give petty Examples: ſhee reſerves her juſtice for the Great ones, and the Proud; for thoſe who having more tender ſenſes, are better able to feele the weight of her anger; or elſe in truth her purpoſe is to ſhew me a particular favour, by a publike declaration, and to let the World ſee, ſhee makes a reckoning of that of which the World makes none. And knowing what the gratefulneſſe of good Letters is, ſhee is deſiro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It exceeded indeed all bounds of moderation, and it ſeemes ſhee would not onely for my ſake protect an innocent, but would be ready, if need were, to reward a delinquent. For acknowledgement of which generous goodneſſe, all my own ſpirit, and all my friends put together, can never be too much.

humour was but a Fit, and continued not long, and that the ſame day upon the tempeſt there followed a calme. A man ſhall meet with ſome Women of ſuch ſpirits, that neither time nor Philoſophy can worke upon them; and ſome others againe, that prevent the worke of time and Philoſophy, by their owne naturall conſtitution. As there is ſome fleſh ſo hard to heale, that no Balme can cure the prick but of a pinne; ſo againe, there are ſome bodies ſo well compoſed, that their wounds are healed with plaine Spring-water, and they cloſe and grow together of themſelves. I aſſure my ſelfe, our faire Lady is of this perfect tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and that ſhe would be no example, to make Widowes condemned for curling their locks, or for wearing their mourning gowns edged with greene. You ſhould alledge unto her the Princeſſe <hi>Leonina,</hi> ſo highly eſteemed of the Court of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the prime ornament of this laſt age. Knowing that her Husbands quirry was come, to relate unto her the particular of his death, and hearing that his Secretary was to come the morrow after, ſhe ſent the quirry word, to forbeare comming to ſee her, till the Secretary were come, that ſo ſhe might not be obliged to ſhed teares twice. There is no vertue now adayes ſo common as conſtancy, nor any thing ſo ſuperfluous, as the cuſtome of comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.

In it you ſhall find that, that will ſhorten the longeſt dayes of this ſeaſon; That, that will keepe you from tediouſneſſe when you are alone; That, that will make you thanke me for my abſence. For to ſay true, all viſits will be unſeaſonable to you, when you ſet your ſelfe to the Recreation of ſo ſweet a reading; and whoſoever ſhall come to trouble you at ſuch a time, muſt needs have from you ſome ſecret maledictions, what civilities ſoever you make ſhew of, as your cuſtome is.

In conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Madam, though I have a heart hard enough, and eyes not very moyſt, yet I could not forbeare to ſhed teares, in ſpight of my ſelfe; and I have been even aſhamed to ſee, that they were but the dreames and fancies of another man, and not my owne proper evils which put into me ſuch true paſſions. This is a tyrannicall power, which the ſenſe uſurpeth over the reaſon, and which makes us ſee, that the neighbour-hood of the imagination is extreamly contagious to the intellectuall part, and that there is much more body than ſoule in this proud creature, which thinks it ſelfe borne to command all others. The <hi>Aethiopick</hi> Hiſtory hath oftentimes given me theſe Alarums, and I cannot yet read it without ſuffering my ſelfe to be deceived. As for other writings of this kinde, it is true, I make ſome choice, and run not after all <hi>Spaniſh Romances,</hi> with equall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. They are indeed for the moſt part, but <hi>Heliodorus</hi> in other clothes, or as — ſayd, but children borne of <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Chariclea,</hi> and ſeeme to reſemble their Father and Mother ſo neere, that there is not a haires breadth of difference betweene them. But in this worke Madam, I make you promiſe you ſhall ſee novelties, and ſhall find in it this ſweet ayre of the wide world, and theſe dainties of the ſpirit, which are not common in our Provinces. I confeſſe unto you, there is in ſome paſſages ſomething that may ſeeme too much painted, and perhaps too gariſh, and which will not beare examining by the rigour of Precepts; but then you muſt confeſſe as well that Fables looke chiefly after beautie, and care not though it be a little immodeſt, ſeeing this kinde of writing is rather a looſe Poeſie, than a regular proſe. As ſoone as I ſhall be able to ride, I will come and heare your Oracles hereupon, and tell you, as I uſe to doe, that as your ſelfe is one of the perfecteſt things I ever ſaw, ſo I am more than any other,</p>

The Booke which I have deſired Monſieur <hi>de</hi> — to deliver to you, ſhall paſſe if you pleaſe, but for a petition to obtaine an audience; and I am contented that my diſcourſes Morall and Politick, ſhall contribute nothing to the mending of my own fortune, ſo they may contribute ſomething to the recommending of my Siſters buſineſſe: if it become me to ſpeake of a perſon that is ſo neere unto me, and if you thinke me worthy to be credited in the teſtimony I ſhall give of her, I am able Sir, to ſay thus much, that ſhee is a woman, either lifted up by her own ſtrength above the paſſions of her ſexe, or that Nature hath exempted her from them, by a peculiar priviledge: ſo farre, as that amongſt us, ſhee ſtands for an example, and leads a life that is the edification of all our Province. But though ſhee make profeſſion of ſevere vertues, yet ſhee aſpires to no glory by ſullen humours; ſhee hath nothing muddy, nor clowniſh in her, but tempers her au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity with ſo much exterior ſweetneſſe, that without endeavouring to pleaſe any, ſhee ſeemes to be pleaſing to all the world. I therefore ſollicite you for her, in behalfe of all the world, and crave your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with violence; for to crave it with diſcretion, would make but a weake ſhew of the deſire I have to obtain it. In matters that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne my ſelfe onely, I am held backe by a certaine naturall timou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſſe, which makes me oftentimes to be wanting to my ſelfe; but in that which concernes her, I obſerve not ſo much as honeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, but am bold, even to temeritie; and if therein <hi>I</hi> ſhould not doe too much, I ſhould never thinke I did enough: and yet this is a fault, which leaves no remorſe behinde it; the merit of the ſubject juſtifies the importunitie of the ſuppliant; and when you ſhall know her better you will find no great exceſſe in that I write, and will bleſſe my perſecution. You have already obliged us exceedingly, and have put the buſineſs in an infallible way of proſpering; it only remaines Sir that you crowne your courteſie, and draw a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding word from the parties, whom I ſhall call <hi>Publicans,</hi> and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple them with Heathens, if they be not converted and led with that

                     <p>SIR, my deare Couſin, I thinke my ſelf a rich man with the goods you have given me: another that ſhould have received the ſame preſent, ſhould not owe you for it the ſame obligation, but the opinion of things, is the meaſure of their value, and becauſe I have neither mind nor eyes that be covetous, I account the Emeraudes of your Peacock, of as great a price as thoſe of Lapidaries: at leaſt, whereas they are without life and motion, theſe live and moove in my baſe Court; I know my riches, and am known by them, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I have read my ſelfe ſtarke blind, I goe and refreſh my wearied ſight in that admirable verdure, which is to me both a recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and remedie. Baſe objects not onely offend my imagination, but even provoke my choler; and I ſhould never receive a Monkey from the beſt of my friends but only to kill it: but I vow unto you, that beautie pleaſeth me whereſoever I meet it; yet becauſe it is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing in womens faces, I like better to behold it in the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of birds, and in the enamelling of flowers. Pleaſures ſo chaſt, are compatible with Lent, and offend not God: and therefore upon theſe one houre in a day, I take pleaſure to ſtand gazing and amuſe my ſelfe: I thanke you for it with all my heart, and paſſionately am<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <head>To Madam <hi>d'Anguitur.</hi> LETTER XVIII.</head>
                     <p>MAdam, It ſhall never be laid to my charge, that you ſpeake of me with honour, and that I underſtand it without feeling. A good opinion is obligatory, from whence ſo ere it come, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more, when it comes from an exquiſite judgement, as yours is; and I doubt not, but <hi>Socrates</hi> was more touched and tickled with that one word the Oracle ſpake of him, than with all the prayſes the world had given him. The favourable diſcourſes you have held of me, ought not to be held of me in leſſe account than words indeed inſpired, &amp; if I ſhould place them in the number of humane teſtimonies, I ſhould ſhew my ſelfe ignorant, that it is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven which hath been your Inſtructour; and that from thence you have received thoſe cleere lights, whereof the Starres are but ſhadowes. I doe not amplifie any thing at adventure, nor ſuffer my ſelfe to be ſwayed with flattery, but in this point of Illumination, Madam, I alwayes except matters of Faith, leaſt your Miniſters ſhould take advantage of my words. We muſt needs, I ſay, hold for certaine, that either you have been inſtructed by an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, or confeſſe that you owe it all to your ſelf, and that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to know the truth, without ſtudie and diſcipline, your vertue is a meere work of your owne making. It is no ſmall matter for one that lives in parts remote from the Court, to be but tolerably reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and able to maintaine his common ſenſe againſt ſo many oppoſites and oppoſitions, as he ſhall meet with; but in thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote parts, where you have no choice of Examples, there to diſcover the <hi>Idaea,</hi> from whence Examples are taken, to breath in an infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ayre, and full of Errours; and yet reteine ſtill ſound opinions; to be continually oppoſed with extravagant queſtions, and yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes returne diſcreet anſwers; To take pittie of ſilly Buffons, when others admire them; to make a difference between jeaſts picked up here and there, and thoſe that come from the Spring it ſelfe; betweene wiſe diſcourſes, and harmonious fooleries: between a ſufficiency that is ſolid, and that which is onely painted; to doe theſe things Madam, ought to be called even halfe a miracle: and no leſſe a raritie in theſe dayes than in former times, it was to ſee a white <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> or a <hi>Scythian</hi> Philoſopher. Our Country may juſtly be proud of ſo admirable a birth; It is the great worke of her famous faecunditie, and wee may boldly ſay, there is that found in <hi>Saintoigne,</hi> which is wanting in the <hi>Circle;</hi> that which hinders the Court from being compleat, and that which is neceſſary for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:120345:156"/>
of <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelfe. But as well here as there Madam, if ever you will heare the vowes of thoſe who wiſh your hapineſſe, I would think it fit, you ſhould not make your ſelfe a ſpectacle for the vulgar, nor ſuffer your entertainment to be a recreation for idle perſons. It deſerves not to be approached unto without preparation; and that they ſhould examine themſelves well, who preſent themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. All ſpirits at all times are not capable of ſo worthy a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and therefore, let men ſay what they will, I account the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations you make of your ſelfe, to be very juſt, and it cannot be thought ſtrange, that being as you are of infinite value, you take ſome time to poſſeſſe your ſelfe alone, and not to loſe your right of reigning; which admits, as no diviſion, ſo no Company. To uſe it otherwiſe Madam, would not be a civiltie, or a courteſie, but indeed an ill husbanding of your ſpirit, and a waſtfull profuſion of thoſe ſingular graces, of which, though it be not fit you ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them that honour you, yet it is fit you ſhould give them out by tale, and diſtribute them by meaſure. It is much better, to have leſſe generall deſignes, and to propoſe to ones ſelfe, a more limited reputation, than to abandon ones ſpirit to every one that will be talking, and to expoſe it to the curioſitie of the people, who leave al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a certain taynt of impuritie upon all things they looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: by ſuch vicious ſufferance, we find dirt and mire carried into Ladies Cloſets: if there come a buſie fellow into the Countrey, preſently honeſt women are beſieged, there is thronging to tell them tales in their eares; and all the world thinks, they have right to torment them: and thus, ſaving the reverence of their good report, though they be chaſte, yet they be publike; and though they can ſpie the leaſt fullying upon their ruffes, yet they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſuffer a manifeſt ſoiling of their nobleſt part. You have done Madam, a great act, to have kept your ſelf free from the tirannie of cuſtome, and to have ſo ſtrongly fortified your ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt uncivill aſſaylants; that, whilſt the Louver is ſurprized, your houſe remaines impregnable. I cannot but magnifie the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent order, with which you diſpoſe the houres of your life; and I take a pleaſure to thinke upon this Sanctuary of yours, by the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reverence of vertue made inviolable: in which, you uſe to retire your ſelfe, either to injoy more quietly your repoſe, or otherwiſe, to exerciſe your ſelfe in the moſt pleaſing action of the world, which is the conſideration of your ſelfe. If after this your happie ſolitude, you come ſometimes and caſt your eyes upon the book I ſent you, you ſhall therein Madam, doe me no great favour: the things you ſhall have thought, will wrong thoſe you ſhall reade; and ſo it ſhall not be a grace, but an affront I ſhall receive, I therefore hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:120345:157"/>
entreat you, there may be ſome reaſonable intermiſſion between two actions, ſo much differing: Goe not ſtreight from your ſelfe to me, but let the reliſh of your owne meditation be a little paſſed over, before you goe to take recreation in my worke. To value it to you, as a piece of great price, or otherwiſe, to vilifie it, as a thing of no value, might juſtly be thought in me an equall vanity. They who praiſe themſelves, deſire conſent, and ſeeke after others appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; they who blame themſelves, ſeeke after oppoſition, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they may be contradicted. This latter humilitie is no better than the others pride. But to the end, I may not ſeeme to goe to the ſame place, by a third way, and deſire to be prayſed, at leaſt with that indifferency I aſcribe to you; I entreat you Madam, that you will not ſpeake the leaſt word, either of the merit of my labour, or in default of merit, of the faſhion of language I have uſed in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you: I meane not to put this Letter upon the ſcore; to ſpeake plainly, I entreat you to make me no anſwer to it, ſo farre I am off, from expecting thanks for it. It is not, Madam, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I make you, it is an homage I owe you; and I pretend not to oblige you at all, but onely to acquit my ſelfe of the firſt act of veneration, which I conceive I owe you, as I am a reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and deſiring all my life to be,</p>

                     <p>SIR, I never deliberate upon your opinion, nor ever examine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mans merit, when you have once told me what to beleeve. But yet, if I ſhould allow my ſelfe the libertie to do otherwiſe, I could but ſtill ſay, that I find Monſieur  
<hi>de</hi> — well worthy the account you hold him in, and my ſelfe well ſatisfied of him, upon his firſt acquaintance. By further converſation, I doubt not, but I ſhould yet diſcover in him more excellent things, but it is no eaſie matter, ever to bring us together againe: For, he is a Carthuſian in his Garriſon, and I an Hermite in the Deſart; ſo
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:120345:157"/>
as that which in our two lives makes us moſt like, is that which makes us moſt unlikely ever to meet: yet I ſometimes heare newes of him; and I can aſſure you, he is but too vigilant in looking to his Charge; hee hath ſtood ſo many Rounds and Sentinells, that it is impoſſible, he ſhould be without rhumes, at leaſt, till Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer. Theſe are, to ſpeake truly, workes of ſupererogation; for I ſee no enemy this Province need to feare, unleſs perhaps, the <hi>Perſian</hi> or <hi>Tartarian:</hi> the very Name of the King is generally forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication enough, over all his Kingdome; and as things now ſtand, <hi>Vangirod</hi> is a place impregnable; that if <hi>Demetrius</hi> came againe into the world, he would loſe his reputation before the meaneſt village of <hi>Beauſſe:</hi> but this is one of your politician ſubtilties, to make <hi>Angouleſme</hi> paſſe for a Frontier Towne, and to give it eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that it may be envied. Doubt not, but I ſhall give you lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thankes for this, ſeeing by this meanes you are cleane gone from us, and I muſt be faine to make a journey of purpoſe into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> if I ever meane to enjoy the contentment of embracing you, and of aſſuring you, that I am<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>SIR, if you were but reſident at <hi>Paris,</hi> I ſhould hope ſometimes to heare of your Newes, but now that you are bewitched there, it will be an ungratefull worke for you to reade mine. They are alwayes ſuch as muſt be pittied. In my way there are as many ſtones to daſh againſt, as in yours there are flowers: and life it ſelfe is as evill that I ſuffer, as it is a good that you enjoy: you left me blind, and may now find me lame; my cauſes of complaining never ceaſe, they doe but change place; and the, favours I receive are ſo husbanded, that I cannot recover an eye, but by the loſſe of a leg. I was yeſterday in a great muſing upon this, when ſuddenly a great light ſhined in my Chamber, and dazeled mine eys, even as I lay in my bed. And not to hold you long in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, the Name of the Angel I mean, was Madam <hi>d' Eſtiſſac,</hi> who thus appeared unto me, and willing to make the world ſee, how much ſhe hath profited in Religion, runs after all occaſions, to put her Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian vertues in practiſe. This ſomwhat abates the vanity I ſhould otherwiſe have taken in her viſit; for, I ſee it is rather charitie than
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:120345:158"/>
courteſie, and I am ſo much beholding to my infirmitie for it, that ſhee made a doubt whether I were ſicke enough to merit it; as much as to ſay, a Paralitick ſhould have had this courteſie from her ſooner than I. They muſt be great miſeries that attract her great favours; pietye which teacheth the fayreſt hands of the world to bury the dead, may well get of the faireſt eyes that ever were, ſome gracious looks to comfort the afflicted. What ere it be, I have found by experience, that no ſadneſs is ſo obſtinate and clowdie, but pleaſing objects may diſſolve and pierce, nor any Philoſopher ſo ſtony and inſenſible, but may be ſoftned and awaked by their lighteſt impreſſion. I verily thinke, another of her viſits would have ſet me on my legges, and made me able to goe: but ſhee thought me not worthy of a whole miracle, and therefore I muſt content my ſelfe with this beginning of my cure. I enforme you of theſe things, as being one that reverenceth their cauſe, and as one loves me too well, to make ſlight of the goods or evills I impart unto him. This laſt words of my Letter ſhall ſerve, if you pleaſe, for a corrective to the former, I revoke it as a blaſphemie, and will never beleeve, that all the Magick in <hi>Paris,</hi> is able to make you forget a man, whom you have promiſed to love, and who paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is,</p>

                     <p>SIR, this is the firſt opportunitie I could get to write unto you, and to comfort my ſelfe for your abſence by this imperfect way, which is the only meanes left mee to enjoy you. Theſe are but ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and figures of that true contentment, I received by your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; but ſince I cannot be wholly happie, I muſt take it in good part that I am not wholly miſerable. I will haſten all I can to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the buſineſſe I have begun, thereby to but my ſelfe in ſtate to ſee you; and if my mind could goe as faſt as my will, I ſhould my ſelfe be with you as ſoone as my Letter. It is true, there cannot be a more delicate and daintie place, than this where I live baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and a friend of ours ſaid, that they who are in exile here, are farre happier than Kings in <hi>Muſcovia:</hi> but being ſeparated from a man ſo infinitely deere unto mee, I doe not thinke, I could live contented in the fortunate Iſlands; and I ſhould be loath to accept

of felicitie it ſelfe, if it were offered me, without your company. Wherefore aſſure your ſelfe, that as ſoone as I can rid my ſelfe of ſome importunate viſits, which I muſt neceſſarily both receive and give, I will not loſe one moment of the time, that I have deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the accompliſhment of — and will travaile much more aſſiduouſly than otherwiſe I ſhould doe, ſeeing it is the end of my travaile, that only can give me the happineſſe of your preſence. In the meane time, I am bound, firſt to tell you, that I have ſeene here — and then to give you thankes for the good cheare he hath made me. He believes upon your word, that I am one of much worth, and gives me Encomiums, which I could not expect from his judgment, but that you have corrupted it, by favouring me too much. I earneſtly entreat you, to let me heare from you, upon all occaſions; and to ſend me by the Poſt the two books, which I ſent for to Monſieur — if you have not received them of him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; but above all, I deſire you, that we may lay aſide all medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and art in writting our Letters; and that the negligence of our ſtile may be one of the marks of the friendſhip between us: and ſo Sir, I take my leave and am with all my ſoule,</p>

Being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not in caſe to aſſure you in perſon, how ſenſible I am of your many courteſies, give me eave to teſtifie unto you, that I am not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of the very laſt you ſhewed me; and that I give you thanks for the beginning of my amendment, whereof you are the cauſe. It is certaine, that when I was burning in a moſt extreame fire, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a notable cooling and comfort, to heare you but only na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and this, Madam, is the firſt miracle you have done in this Countrey, if you ſtay but a while here, I hope we ſhall ſee many more and greater, and that you will leave ſome excellent markes, that you have been here. Our deſarts ſhall be no longer rude, or ſavage, having once been honoured by your preſence, the ſweet ayre, that breaths on the bankes of the <hi>Loyre,</hi> ſhall ſpread it ſelfe hither; and I doubt not, but you will change all the choler of <hi>Lymouſin</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Reaſon, and make our Lyons become men. I doe not thinke, there is any will oppoſe this truth, unleſs perhaps — who had the heart to part from you with drie eyes, and could not finde teares to accompany yours.

                     <p>MAdam, I am jealous of my Lacquies fortune, who makes now a ſecond journey to you, and conſequently, ſhall be twice together more happie then my ſelf: he ſhould never have this advantage of me, if to a journey to ſee you, there went nothing but courage, and if the relicks of my diſeaſe, which prey upon weakneſs, did not tyre me more than the extreame violence did, when I had ſome ſtrength to reſiſt it. By ſtaying in my chamber, I looſe all the fayre dayes that ſhine in the garden; all the riches of the fields are gathered without me; I have no part in the fruits of Autumne, whereof the Spring gave me ſuch ſweet hopes; and I am promiſed health at winter, when I ſhall ſee nothing but a pale Sunne, a thread-bare Earth, and dead ſticks, that have brought forth grapes, but not for me to eat. In this miſerable eſtate, I have no comfort, but onely the Letter you did me the honor to write unto me, which is ſo precious to me Madam, that I even honour it, with a kinde of ſuperſtition, and am ready to make a chaine or bracelet of it, to try whether the wearing it about me, may not prove a better Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt my Feaver, than all the other I have uſed. There is but one word in it that I cannot endure, being not able to conceive why you ſhould call your ſelfe unfortunate; are you not afraid, leaſt God ſhould call you to account for this word? and charge you with ungratefulneſſe, for making ſo ſlight reckoning of his great benefits and Graces? He hath lifted you up above your owne ſexe, and ours too, and hath ſpared nothing to make you compleat: the better part of <hi>Europe</hi> admires you; and in this point, both Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions are agreed, and no conteſting between Catholique and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant; The Popes <hi>Nuntio,</hi> hath preſented our beliefe even to your perſon, all perfumed with the complements and civilities of <hi>Italie,</hi> Princes are your Courtiers, and Doctors your Schollers: and is this Madam, that you call to be unfortunate? and that which you take for a juſt cauſe to complaine; I humbly intreat you, to ſpeak hereafter in more proper termes, and to acknowledge Gods favours in a more gratefull manner. I know well, that your loyaltie hath ſuffered by your brothers Rebellion; and that in the publike miſeries you have had ſome private loſs, but ſo long as you have your noble heart, and your excellent ſpirit left you, it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, you ſhould be unfortunate; for indeed, in theſe two parts, the true Madam <hi>Deſloges</hi> is all entire and whole. It is I Madam, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:120345:161"/>
have juſt cauſe to ſay, I am unfortunate, who am never without paine, never without griefe, never without enemies; and even at this very time, I write from a houſe of griefe, where my mother and my ſiſter being ſicke on one hand, and my ſelfe on the other, I ſeeme to be ſick of three ſickneſſes at once; yet be not afraid, leaſt this I ſend you ſhould be infectious, as though I had a deſigne to poyſon you with my preſents, for I have not yet medled with any of the Muſque fruits, which I hope you ſhall eat; I have not durſt ſo much as to come neere them, leaſt I ſhould chance to leave ſome light impreſſion of my Feaver upon them: They are originally Natives of <hi>Languedoc;</hi> and not ſo degenerated from the goodneſſe of their aunceſtors, but that you will find them, I hope of no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing taſte, and beſides Madam, they grow in a ſoyle that is not hated of Heaven, and where I can aſſure you, your Name is ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten rehearſed, and your vertue ſo highly eſteemed, that there is not an Eccho in all our woods, but knowes you for one of the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things in the world, and that I am,</p>

                     <p>MAdam, ſee here the firſt thankes I give you, for you know, that having never done me but diſpleaſures, I have never yet returned you but complaints: but now at laſt you have been pleaſed to begin to oblige me, and after ſo many ſentences of death, which you have pronounced againſt me, and after ſo many cruelties, which I have ſuffered, you have bethought your ſelfe, ten yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to ſend me one good newes, which truly is ſo pleaſing to me, that I muſt confeſſe, you had no other way to reconcile your ſelfe unto me; and I cannot forbeare to bleſſe the hand that brought mee a Letter from Madam <hi>Deſloges,</hi> though they were dyed in my bloud, and had given me a thouſand wounds. The ſenſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer injuries hath no competition with ſo perfect a joy, and of two paſſions equally juſt, the more violent is eaſily overcome of the more ſweet. You have haſtened the approach of my old age, and made gray one halfe of my haire; you have baniſhed mee this Kingdome, and forced me to flie your tyranny, by flying into another Country: finally, it is no thanks to you, that I have not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:120345:161"/>
broken my owne necke, and made matter for a Tragedie: and yet foure lines of Madam <hi>Deſloges,</hi> have the force to blot out all this long ſtory of my miſ-fortunes, and willingly with all my heart, I forget all the diſpleaſures I have received, for this good office you now affoord me. I make you this diſcourſe in our firſt language, that I may not diſobey Monſieur <hi>de</hi> — who will have me write, but will not have me write in any other ſtile, for in truth, and to ſpeake ſeriouſly, now that he leaves me at libertie, I muſt confeſſe unto you Madam, that I am exceedingly bound unto you, for the continency I have learned by being with you, and good examples you have given me: your medicines are bitter, but they heale; you have baniſhed me, but it is from priſon: and if my paſſions be cooled by the ſnow of my head, I have then never a white hayre, which I may not count for one of your favours: I therefore recant my former complaints, and confeſſe my ſelfe your debtour of all my vertue. The time I have imployed in your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, hath not been ſo much the ſeaſon of my diſorderd life, as it hath been an initiating me into a regular life which I meane to lead. Your converſation hath been a ſchoole of auſteritie unto me, and you have taught me, never to be either yours, or any others, but only in our Lord,</p>

                     <p>MAdam, my evill Fortune gives one common beginning to all my Letters: I am impatient even to death, to have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to come and ſee you: but now that I am well, the ayre is ſicke, and all the Country drowned: There is no land to be ſeene between this and <hi>Lymouſin;</hi> and the miſchiefe is, that there is no navigation yet found out, for ſo dangerous a voyage.

Yet take heed, you haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard not your judgement too freely, upon the unce taintie of humane things: you eſteeme well of a Prince, who is not yet borne, you ſhould have ſeene his Horoſcope from the poynt of his conception, before you ſhould ſpeak of him in ſo loftie termes. But beſides that, nothing is leſſe aſſured, than the future; and nothing apter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, than hope: Conſider, Madam, I beſeech you, that you fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour an unfortunate man, and that Faction oftentimes carries it away from truth.

                     <p>MAdam, we receive the Anſwers of Oracles without making reply; perfect devotion is dumbe, and if you had left me the uſe of my tongue, I ſhould then have had one part at leaſt, of my ſpirit free from this univerſall aſtoniſhment that hath ſurprized it. You are alwayes lifted up above the ordinary condition of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the divineneſſe of your ſpirit is no longer an Article in queſtion amongſt people that are reaſonable; yet I muſt confeſſe, you never ſhewed it more viſibly, then in the laſt Letter you writ unto me, and if at other times I have beene dazeled with ſome beame, you have now made me ſtarke blind with the fulneſſe of your light. Spare Madam, I intreat you, the weakneſſe of my ſight, and if you will have me be able to indure your preſence, take ſome more humane forme, and appeare not all at once in the fulneſſe of that you are, I were never able to abide ſuch another flaſh of bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. My eyes are weary with looking upward, and with conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, as you are a creature, adorable and divine. Hereafter I will not looke upon you, but on that ſide you are good and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and will not venture to reaſon with you any more, for feare I ſhould to my owne confuſion illuſtrate the advantage of your ſpirit over mine. You ſhall have nothing from me hereafter, but prayers and thanks; and I will make you confeſſe, that I ſollicite better than I praiſe, I therefore ſend you now Madam, divers croſſes at one time, and perſecute you with no leſſe then three afflictions at once, I meane, three Letters of recommendation, which I requeſt from you, in behalfe of — humbly entreat you to deliver them to this meſſenger, &amp; to write them in ſuch a perſwaſive ſtyle, as might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to corrupt all the <hi>Gatoes</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> although indeed, the cleerneſſe of our right, hath more need of their integretie then of their favour.

                     <p>MAdam, in the ſtate I am now in, there is none but your ſelfe could make me ſpeak: and I never did a greater worke in my life than to dictate theſe foure untoward lynes: my ſpirit is ſo whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up with the conſideration of my miſery, and flies all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and company, in ſo violent a manner, that if it concerned me not exceedingly, you ſhould know that — finds himſelfe infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely obliged to your courteſies, and my ſelf no leſſe than he; I thinke verily, I ſhould have 
let — depart, without ſo much as bidding him Farewell. Pardon Madam, the weakneſſe of a vulgar ſpirit, which feeles no croſſes light, and falls flat down at the very firſt blow of adverſe Fortune. Perhaps in proſperitie, I ſhould carry my ſelfe better, and I doe not thinke, that joy could make me inſolent; but to ſay the truth, in afliction I am no body, and that which would not ſo much as leave a ſcratch upon the skin of a Stoick, pierceth me to the very heart, and makes in it moſt deepe wounds. Griefe dejects me in ſuch ſort, and makes me ſo lazie in doing my dutie, and ſo unfit for all functions of a civill life, that I wondred no longer at thoſe that were turned into trees and rockes, and loſt all ſenſe with only the ſenſe of griefe. Yet Madam, as often as I call to minde, that I hold ſome part in your account and love; I am forced to confeſſe, that my melancholy is unjuſt, and that I have no good foundation for my ſadneſſe. This honour ought to be unto me a generall remedy againſt all ſorts of affliction, and the miſery that you pittie is not ſo much to be pittied as to be envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. From thence it is, that I draw all the comfort I am capable of, humbly entreating you to beleeve you ſhall never pitie a man in miſery, that will be more gratefull than my ſelfe, nor that is more paſſionately, than I am</p>

                     <p>MAdam, I received but juſt now your Letters of the five and twentieth of the laſt moneth, and though I know not, by whom to ſend an anſwer, yet I can no longer hold from expreſſing my joy, nor keepè my words from leaving my heart to fall upon this paper. The laſt time I writ unto you, I had heard of the unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a friend of mine, which ſtruck me to the very heart; ſince which time, a better report hath ſomewhat quieted me; but it is you, Madam, that have reſtored to me the full uſe of my reaſon; and are a cauſe that I am contented to live. Although corruption be in a manner univerſall, and that there is no more any goodneſſe to be found amongſt men, yet as long as you are in the world, it is not fit to leave it quite, but your vertue may well ſupply all its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Beſides Madam, if it be true, as you doe me the honour to write unto me, that you account my intereſts as your owne; this very conſideration is enough to make them dearer to me than they were before; and I am therefore bound to preſerve my ſelfe, ſeeing it ſeemes, you would be loath to loſe me. One graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous word, which I obſerved in your Letter, hath wonne me to you, in ſuch ſort, that I have no longer any power of my ſelfe, but what you leave me; and in all your Empire, which is neither meane, nor conſiſts of meane ſubjects; I can aſſure you, that you poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe nothing with more ſoveraigntie, than my will. If your occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions draw you to <hi>Annix</hi> this next ſpring, I hope to have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſee you at <hi>Balzac,</hi> where I am trimming up — with all the care I can, that it may be a little more worthy of your preſence, and that the amuſement I ſhall thereby give you, may keepe you from marking the ill cheare you are like to find in a Country village: My ſiſter is infinitely bound to you, for the honour you doe her, in remembring her; and I am my ſelfe, with all my ſoule,</p>

Monſieur <hi>de</hi> — will I doubt not, be my witneſſe herein; and will tell you, that what part ſoever I be forced to play amongſt jeaſters and merry companions, yet under my players cloathes, there will alwayes be found an honeſt man. I have been ſenſible, Madam of the loſſe,

which — hath had, and have not been ſparing to ſpeake of his unfortunate vertue; yet I never thought, he needed any comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for it; for, ſeeing he ſees that God ſpares not his own Images, and that his neereſt friends have their diſgraces and troubles, he ought not to thinke any thing ſtrange that happens in this inferiour world, and upon inferiour perſons; what conſideration ſoever may otherwiſe make them deare unto him. If you have vouchſafed to keepe the Letters I have written to you; I humbly entreat you to ſend them to me, that I may ſee what volume I can make for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that is required of me: but Madam it ſhall be, if you pleaſe upon this condition, that parting with the Letters, you ſhall never let your memory part with the truths they containe, but hold undoubtedly that I very firmely am, though I doe not very often ſay I am,</p>

The end of all fayre Pictures, and good Books, is but onely to pleaſe your eyes, and to delight your ſpirit, and the good you have not yet ſet a price upon, is not yet come to its utter moſt perfection.

                     <p>MAdam, I writ unto you about ſix weekes ſince, but my packet not being delivered where I appointed it, I perceive ſome curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body hath ſeazed on it, and ſought for ſecrets, which he could not find. The loſſe is not great, to loſe nothing, but a few untoward words; and ſmall comforting would ſerve me, for ſo ſmall a croſſe; yet becauſe they were full of the paſſion I owe to your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and carried in them the markes of my dutie, I cannot but be troubled, they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>me not to your hands, and that my miſ-fortune gives you cauſe to complaine of my negligence. I dare not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to cleere my ſelfe altogether; for though in this I committed no fault, yet I cannot forget ſome other faults committed before. The truth is Madam, I have been for ſome time ſo continually ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with buſineſſe, that I have beene wanting in the principall obligations of a civill life; and I have drunke beſides ſo many bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter potions, and taſted ſo many bitter Pills, that I ſhould but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you with my complements; which could not chooſe but carrie with them, at leaſt ſome tincture of my untoward hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. What pleaſure could you have taken, to ſee a medley of choler and Melancholy powred out upon paper, and in ſtead of pleaſing Newes, to read nothing but pittifull Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and mortall Predictions? But enough of this unpleaſing mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I expect here within three or foure dayes, my Lord the Biſhop of <hi>Nantes;</hi> and I would to God Madam, you could be here at that time, and that you were at leiſure to come and taſte the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of this rare perſonage. I have heard you ſay heretofore, you never ſaw a more holy countenance than his, and that his very looke, was a Prologue of perſwaſion. This conceit, makes me hope, that he is the man, whom God hath ordained to be your Converter, and to bring you into the boſome of our Church, Beleeve me Madam, and you ſhall not be deceived; truſt that ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who wounds nor, but onely to draw out the bloud that cauſes a Feaver; and never make difficultie to commit your ſelfe to one, that intends your freedome. The triumph which the world makes you feare, is no way injurious to thoſe that be the captives, nor like unto that of which <hi>Cleopatra</hi> tooke ſo ſad an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: but in this caſe, the vanquiſhed are they that are crowned, and all the glory and advantage of the victory reſts on their ſide: I am not out of hope to ſee ſo good a dayes worke;

                     <p>MAdam, it hath beene, as much my ſhame, as my glory, to read your Letter, having ſo ill deſerved it; and the remorſe of the fault, I committed, makes mee, that I dare not yet rejoyce in the honour, I received. You are good and gracious, even to the not hating of evill actions; Your delinquents, not only obteine impunitie, but you allow them recompence; and idleneſſe hath more reſpect with you, than deligent ſervice with ordinary Maſters. This is the faelicite of the Golden age, where Plentie had no neede of tilling; and where there was reaping without ſowing. Yet Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I muſt not ſo abandon my cauſe, that I forbeare to alledge the good it hath in it; it is long ſince I writ unto you, it is true, but the cauſe hath beene for that theſe ſix moneths, I have every day been upon comming to ſee you and according to the ſaying of the Oratour, your acquaintance, I have diſpenced, with my ordinary worſhipping, in hope of a great Holy day; and to performe my devotion with the more ſolemnitie. If Monſieur <hi>de</hi> — have kept his word with mee, he hath told you, how often he hath found me upon the very poynt of comming; but as many journeys, as I intended to make, ſo many croſſe accidents alwayes happened to hinder them, and the miſ-fortune that accompanies me, makes every dutie, though never ſo eaſie to another, impoſſible to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Yet Madam, I have never ceaſed from doing continuall acts of the reverence I beare you, and I never ſweare, but by your merit. My braine is drie in any other Argument, and words are drawne from me one by one; but when there is occaſion to ſpeake of you, then I overflow in words; upon this only Text, I take pleaſure to be Preaching; and Monſieur <hi>de</hi> — to whom I was alwayes before a harkener; as ſoone as I begin diſcourſe of you, becomes my auditour. I can aſſure you Madam, he honours you exceedingly; and neither his ambaſſage to <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence Gentlemen returne not commonly without a certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of ſoveraigntie; nor the imployments of the State, which make particular men thinke themſelves the Publike, have been able to make him take upon him, this ungratefull gravitie, which makes Greatneſſe ridiculous, and even vertue it ſelfe odious. He hath proteſted here, before good companie, that hee will never be found other, and that Fortune ſhould have an ill match in hand, to thinke to corrupt him. I uſed my ordinary rudeneſſe, and intreated him, to be mindfull of his word, and to be one of our firſt examples of ſo rare a moderation. You ſhall ſee Madam, in a Letter I ſend you; that which hereupon I am bound to ſay of him: and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, to maintaine for me, that I am no common prayſer: and that, if I were not perſwaded of what I ſay, it is not all the Canons of his Fort ſhould make mee to ſay it. It is onely the worth of things, or at leaſt, the opinion I have of their worth, that drawes from mee the prayſes I give them. If Monſieur

                     <p>MAdam, your place is before all other things whatſoever, and therefore no lawfull impediment can be alleged, for fayling in the dutie, that is due unto you. I have theſe two moneths had great affayes; which in the rigour of your Juſtice, is as much as to ſay, I have theſe two moneths neglected my dutie. Having not written to you, in all this time, I am contented to call it, a Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which otherwiſe I ſhould call a Buſineſſe, and I doe not thinke, I could with all the reaſons of the world have made you patient, to ſtay ſo long, for the thanks I am to give you. Your preſent hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually wherewith to content both the covetous and the vaine; it hath ſoliditie no leſſe then luſtre; the onely ſight of it refutes the modeſtie you uſe in ſpeaking of it: you are injurious Madam, to ſo excellent a thing; it deſerves the moſt ſtately inſcription you could deviſe to give it, and if I were worth the having of a Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, this ſhould be the prime piece, I would make choice of to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne it. Becauſe vulgar people have nothing but eyes, therefore they value nothing but Candleſtickes of Cryſtall, and guilded vermillian diſhes; but men of underſtanding, who ſee leſſe with their eyes than with their ſpirits, they reflect upon objects, that are more ſimple and immateriall, and preferre not the peoples errour, and Artificers fingers, before the truth of things, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:120345:170"/>
before the Maſter-pieces of the workes of reaſon. Hee, to whom you did me the honour to ſend me, is farre above all the Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums I can give him: I have onely this to ſay Madam, that I have with me here, a famous Authour, who as ſoone as he hath once read him, is reſolved inſtantly to ſhut up ſhop, and give over his Trade. He proteſts he will never more ſet band to Penne, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be to ſigne his laſt Will; and therefore meants to make you a ſacrifice of all his Papers. I ſhewed him the incomparable Sonnet, <hi>De L' Amant qui meurt,</hi> at every verſe, he called you Divine, and made ſuch lowd Exclamations, that he might have been heard to the great high way: which you know, how very farre it is from my Chamber. Hee ſayth, he will maintaine it, even to the ſtreet Saint <hi>Jaques,</hi> that <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> is fallen upon the Diſtaffe; and that <hi>Racan</hi> hath given over the right he pretended in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of <hi>Malherbe.</hi> He ſpeakes in this familiar manner, of theſe two great Perſonages, and I never heare him uſe any meaner ſtyle: if I can keepe him with me a while; I will tell you more of him, and promiſe you a Collection of all his Apopthegms. I ſaw yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Monſieur <hi>de</hi> — who is a moſt juſt valuer of vertue, and by conſequent, moſt perfectly reveres yours. He infinitely deſires you would come amongſt us, and that you would make choice of one of his houſes for your abode: if you were pleaſed to doe this, I ſhould have no more journeys to make: I ſhould be the happieſt unhappie man that ever was, if I had you here to be my comforter, and that I might be alwayes telling you, that I alwayes am,</p>

                     <p>MAdam, you never heard ſpeake of ſuch a deligence; in two months your Letter hath gone twelve myles; ſo as a buſineſſe that required haſt, had been this way in a good caſe: and if therein you had given me adviſe for ſaving my life, I might have had good leiſure to die, before your adviſe came.

                     <p>MAdam, I am of your opinion, and can by no meanes approve the ambition of your fayre neighbour: her head is full of ſtate and ſoveraigntie, and aymes certainly at a Crowne. God loves her too well to ſecond her bad deſires, and to give her that ſhee askes: ſo rare a beautie ought to be the recompence of vertue, and not the prey of Greatneſſe: It is fit, that he who poſſeſſeth her, ſhould underſtand, when things be excellent; ſhould know the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of this, and all his life be thankfull to his good fortune for it: it is fitter to make a Gentleman happie, than to give contentment to a tyrant; ſhee might perhaps be ſome amuſment to him, when he were cloyed with killing of men; but withall, ſhee might be ſure to be the next object of his crueltie, at the next fit of his wicked humour. You know the Story of <hi>Mariamne;</hi> our Theaters at this day ſound forth nothing ſo much, as the cryes of this poore Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:120345:171"/>
he that puts her to death, loved her above meaſure; and after her death, kneeled downe a thouſand times before her image, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to forgive him. <hi>Poppea</hi> was firſt the Miſtris, afterwards the wife, and alwayes the Governeſſe of <hi>Nero;</hi> ſhe had vanquiſhed this Monſter, and made him tame, yet at laſt he ſlipt from her, and in an inſtant of his choler, gave her a kicke upon the belly, which was her death. His unkle <hi>Caius</hi> dealt not ſo roughly with <hi>Caeſonia,</hi> yet in the greateſt heat of his fire, he made love to her in theſe termes: <hi>This fayre bead ſhall be chopt off, as ſoone as I but ſpeak the word:</hi> and told her ſometimes, that he had a great minde to put her on the racke, to make her tell him, why he loved her ſo much. The meaning Madam, of all this is, that the tameſt of all Tygers is a cruell Beaſt; and that it is a moſt dangerous thing, to be wooed with talons. I have ſeene the Booke you writ to me of, and find it not unpleaſing; particularly, where ſpeaking of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of <hi>Paſquius,</hi> and of ſatyricall Poets, he ſayth, that beſides the golden age, the age of ſilver, of braſſe, and of iron, ſo famous and ſo much talkt of in their Fables; there is yet behinde to come an age of wood, of which the ancient Poets never dreamt; and in the miſeries and calamities whereof, they themſelves ſhall have a greater part than any other.

He is in truth, a great man in his profeſſion, one might well truſt him, and ſleepe from hence to <hi>Paris:</hi> He glides by the brink of <hi>Praecipices,</hi> and paſſeth broken bridges with an admirable dexteritie, ſay what you can of his manners otherwiſe; Pardon mee, my Lord, if I maintaine that they be no vices, and that you doe him, great wrong to reproach him with them in your Letter. He doth that by deſigne,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:120345:172"/>
which you thinke he doth by inclination; and becauſe he had heard; that a man once overthrew the Commonwealth, when he was ſober, he thinkes, that to drinke well, is no ill qualitie to well governing: He takes otherwiſe no care for going aſtray, ſeeing he hath a God for his guide, and a God that was returned from the <hi>Indies</hi> before <hi>Alexander</hi> was come into the world. After ſo long a voyage, one may well truſt Father <hi>Denys,</hi> with a ſhort walke; and he that hath yoked Tygers, may well be allowed to guyde horſes.

                     <p>SIR, I am ſorry to heare of the continuance of your maladie, though I hope, it be not ſo great as you make it. Theſe are fruits of this unſeaſonable time, and I doubt not, but your Fleame, which overflowes with the rivers, will alſo with the fall of the rivers, returne againe to its naturall bounds. I have had my part in this inundation, and it would be no ſmall commoditie to me, that things ſhould ſtay in the ſtate they now are in; for by this means my houſe being made an Iſland, I ſhould be leſſe troubled,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:120345:172"/>
than now I am by people of the firme Land; But ſeeing upon the abating of the waters, depends the abating of your Rheume, I am contented with all my heart, they ſhall abate; as above all things deſiring your health: yet withall, I muſt tell you, there is care to be uſed: you muſt abſteine from all moyſt meates, forbeare the good cheare of <hi>Paris,</hi> and follow the adviſe of an ancient ſage, who counſelled a man troubled with your diſeaſe, <hi>to change the rayne into drowth.</hi> You ſee how bold I am, to ſend you my prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions; I entreat you to follow them, but not to imitate me; for in this matter of Medicines, I confeſſe my ſelfe a Phariſee; I commend a Julippe to others, but I drinke my ſelfe the <hi>ſweeteſt Wines.</hi> But to ſpeake of ſomething elſe, I cannot imagine, why Monſieur <hi>de</hi> — ſhould keepe me languiſhing ſo long, and have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made me ſtand waiting three moneths after his time appointed, ſhould now require a further prorogation; and a longer delay. For my part, I verily beleeve, he ſpake not in earneſt, when he made you this untoward anſwer, and that it was rather for a tryall of your patience, than for an exerciſe: He hath the reputation of ſo honeſt and juſt a man, that I can make no doubt of that he hath promiſed to Monſieur <hi>de</hi> — and I am perſwaded, he accounts himſelfe more ſtreightly tyed by his word, than by his bond.

Yet ſeeing you will needs have me ſpeake, I cannot but obey you, though I make uſe of a ſtrangers hand to quarrel with you.

And the lawes of Decencie are ſo ancient, that they ſeeme to be a part of the ancient religion. <hi>Moſes</hi> hath extended the commandements of God, even to the diſtinction of your apparell, and ours: and you know he expreſly forbids to diſguiſe our ſelves in one anothers cloathes. Women muſt be altogether women: the vertues of our ſex, are not the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of theirs; and the more they ſeek to imitate men, the more they degenerate from their owne kinde. We have had ſome women amongſt us, that would ride <hi>Spaniſh</hi> horſes, would diſcharge Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols, and would be parties in maintaining quarrels. M. the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall <hi>Scomberg</hi> ſhewed me once a letter, which he writ to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman  
of — at the end whereof are theſe words; <hi>I kiſſe the hands of this valiant and pleaſing Lady, that is your ſecond in the day, and your wife at night.</hi> This Lady might parhaps be valiant, but to my humour, ſhe could not be pleaſing. If ſhe had had a beard, ſhe could not have had a greater fault. Women that are valiant, are as much to blame, as men that are cowards. And it is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly for Ladies to weare ſwords by their ſides, as for Gentlemen to have glaſſes hanging at their girdles. I profeſſe my ſelfe an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Madam, to theſe uſurpations of one ſex upon another. It ſtrikes me with a kinde of horror, when I read in hiſtories of the ancient women Fencers, whom the <hi>Romanes</hi> beheld with ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in their Amphitheater; and I account not <hi>Amazons</hi> in the number of women, but of Monſters and Prodigies. Sweetneſſe and tenderneſſe are the qualities that belong to you; and will your ſhe Friend give over her claime to theſe, that is, to the ſucceſſion of her mother, and the priviledges of her birth? will ſhe not be as well contented as you, with the partition which Nature her ſelfe hath made? I cannot conceive with what face ſhe can goe a hunting amongſt ſuch violence and tumults, and how ſhe can run hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all day, till ſhee be out of breath, after a kennell of Hounds, and a troope of Huntſemen. God made her for the Cloſet, and not for the Field: and in truth, it is a great ſin to diſtend ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome a mouth, and to disfigure ſo comely a face, with blowing a borne. To expoſe ſuch excellent things to all the boughes of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:120345:174"/>
Forreſt, and to all the injuries of the weather; and to endanger ſuch pretious colours with winde and raine, with the Sun and duſt. And yet, Madam, to ſee hunting, without being a partie; to goe in Coach, and in Parkes incloſed, where a multitude of beaſts are kept priſoners, and come to dye at Ladies feet; ſuch a recreation as this, I doe not condemne, being only entertained with the eyes, and may paſſe either for a ſpectacle, or a walke; and is as farre from agitation, as from reſt. But this ſerves not her turne, ſhe cals theſe but lazie and ſedentarie recreations, and takes no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but when it is with hazard of her life. But what would be thought Madam, if one would come and tell you, ſhee is ſlaine with a fall, by ranke riding, or that ſhee hath met with a wild Boare, that was too hard for her? In ſuch caſes, there would not onely be no excuſe for her death, but it would bee a blot upon her memory for ever: and to ſave her honor, there muſt bee feigned ſome other accident in her Epitaph. As for that other diſcourſing Lady you complaine of, and whom I know, ſhe commits not in truth ſuch extravagant faults as this doth; yet ſhe hath her faults too: and I can no more allow of women to be Doctors, than of women to be Cavaliers. She ſhould take you for a paterne, and make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the good example you give. You know indeed, an infinite number of excellent things; but you make no open confeſſion of your knowledge, as ſſee doth, and you ſhew, you have not learned them to keepe a Schoole. You ſpeake to her, when ſhe preacheth to you; and making popular anſwers to her riddles, and giving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction to her confuſion: you doe her at leaſt, this good office, to expound her to her ſelfe. Neither in the tune of your voyce, nor in the manner of your expreſſing, is any thing ſeen in you, but that which is naturall and French: and although your ſpirit bee of an extreame high elevation, and farre above the ordinarie reach, yet you ſo accomodate it to the capacitie of all that heare you, that whileſt the meaner ſort doe underſtand you, the more able ſpirits do admire you. It is a great matter Madam, to have gotten the knowledge of ſuch excellent things: but it is a greater matter ſo to hide them, as if they were ſtollen, and to call them, as you do, by the name of of your ſecret Truantings. Your Canvas, your Silk, your Needles are ſeen, but your papers are not ſeen; and thoſe women that are taken with men that are not their husbands, are not more ſurprized than you are, when you are found to have an Authour in your hand, that is not French. I know therefore, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, you cannot approve of one ſo contrarie to your ſelfe, how faire a ſhew ſoever you make, nor will ever change the plainneſſe of your words, for her learned gybriſh. Pedanterie is not ſufferable

And what patience can endure to heare one talke a whole day together, Metamorphoſis and Philoſophie; to mingle the <hi>Idaeas</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi> and the <hi>Praedicables</hi> of <hi>Porphirie</hi> together: to make no complyment, that hath not in it a dozen Horizons and Hemiſpheares; and at laſt, when ſhe hath no more to ſay, then to raile upon me in Greeke, and accuſe me of Hyperbole, and Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeale? Theſe be her deviſes, ſhe will have, in two verſes, at leaſt foure full points; ſhe hath a deſigne to ſet on foot, and bring into uſe againe, the Strophes and Antiſtrophes; ſhe gives Rules both of Epick and Dramatick Poeſie, and ſayth, ſhe cannot endure a Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, that is not within the law of foure and twentie houres: and this ſhe is going about to publiſh through all <hi>France.</hi> If I had a mortall enemie, I would deſire no greater revenge of him, than to wiſh him ſuch a wife. Nothing hath more confirmed me in my deſire of ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, than the example of this Ladie: and I ſee plainly, that a ſingle life is the beſt thing in the world, ſeeing it lies in covert, and is free from the cumber of this talking Ladie.

They invocate you, as their Redeemer; and if <hi>Themis</hi> be the goddeſs of good cauſes, it ſeems you are the goddeſs of good ſucceſs.

I could tell you, to make you reſpect him the more, that he is able to thanke you, in five or ſix languages; that he hath a full Magazine of Aſtrolabes and Globes; and that, being but of a meane ſtatute, he hath yet, by his knowledge in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, found a meanes to make himſelfe as high as Heaven. But I will content my ſelfe to ſay, that he is my friend, and your Oratour: that if my commendation, and your own glory be deare unto you, you cannot but very ſhortly ſend him backe with full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.

                     <p>MY moſt deare Siſter, I ſend you the Book which you required of me, for my Neece, and I beleeve, that this and her Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer-Booke may very well ſuffice to make up her whole Librarie: ſhe ſhall find in it, a Devotion that is not too myſticall, nor too much refined; and which hath nothing but Morall and reaſonable. I like this popular Divinitie, which meets us halfe way, and ſtoops a little, that we may not ſtrayne our ſelves too much. It follows the example of its Authour, who made himſelfe familiar with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, and put not backe ſo much as Curtiſans and Publicans, farre from making diviſion in families, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing women from obedience to their mothers, and their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands. It commends this obedience, as their principall vertue, and calls it a ſecond worſhip, and a ſecond religion. I ſhall be glad to ſee my Neece make profeſſion of a pietie, ſo conformable to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reaſon, and ſo good a counſellour of all other duties. But let her not, I pray, climbe higher, and undertake Meditations of her owne head. <hi>Irenada</hi> whom I ſent her, hath taken this paines for her and hath meditated for her, and for all other that ſhall read his Bookes. There is nothing more dangerous, than to mount up to Heaven without a helper and a guide; and it is a great confidence, one muſt have in his Spirit, to let it goe ſo farre, and be aſſured, it will ever come backe againe. It is not long agoe, there was in a Towne of <hi>Spaine,</hi> a Societie of devoted perſons, who continued in meditation ſo many houres a day, leaving of all baſe workes, to live, as they ſayd, a more heavenly life; but what thinke you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of it? even a thouſand domeſticall diſorders, and a thouſand publike extravagancies. The leſs credulous tooke the pricke of a pinne, for a Saints marke, the more humble, accounted their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands prophane; the wiſer ſort ſpake what came in their heads, and made faces perpetually. In ſo much, that when in the moneth of <hi>May,</hi> there did not paſt three or foure runne mad; it was

counted a good yeare. It is fit to ſtay ones ſelfe upon the true ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and not to follow the vaine Phantaſmes of holineſſe. And it is farre ſafer, to ground ones ſelfe upon a ſolid and certain reading, than to goe wandring in a hollow, and unſteady contemplation. If I had more time, you ſhould have mors words; but he that brings you the letter, calls upon me for it, and I can adde no more to it, but that I perfectly am,</p>

                     <p>MY deareſt Siſter, all the world tells me, that my Niece is fayre, and you may beleeve, I will challenge no man, for ſaying ſo: Beautie is in Heaven a qualitie of thoſe glorious bodies, and in Earth the moſt viſible marke that comes from Heaven. It is not fit therefore to ſlight theſe gifts of God, nor to make ſmall account of this ſparke of the life to come: It is not fit to be of ſo croſſe an humour, to blame that which is generally prayſed. Marke when a comely perſonage comes in place, having but this advantage of her birth, you ſhall preſently ſee all that were talking, to hold their peace; and what noyſe ſoever there was before, you ſhall have all huſht, and an univerſall calme upon a ſuddaine: you ſhall ſee a whole great multitude, all buſie in different matters to make preſently but one body, and that onely to ſtand to gaze and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; ſome leave the tales they had begun, ſome curtoll their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and cut them off in the middeſt; every man puts off his conceits to ſome other time, onely to take a full view, and to contemplate this divine thing that preſents it ſelfe.

But the miſchiefe is, my deere Siſter, that the Feſtivals are ſhort, the youth is not laſting, and the fayre at laſt come to be ill favoured. Queenes and Princeſſes grow old, and there is no old beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but that of God, of the Sunne, and of the Starres.

Wee are frighted ſometimes to ſee the ſpoyle and ruines of Faces, upon which the foote of ſickneſſe hath troaden, and there is nothing, in which we may more obſerve, the lamentable markes of the inconſtancie of humane things. From hence I conclude, that beauty being a thing ſo frayle and tender, ſubject to ſo many accidents, and ſo hard to keepe; it is fit we ſhould ſeeke after another beautie, that is more firme and permanent, that can better withſtand corruption, and better defend it ſelf againſt the force of time. Above all, it is not fit, that women ſhould be proud of a qualitie, that is infamous for the loſſes and wracks of many poore Conſciences, and which as innocent and chaſt as it can be, will yet be a cauſe to raiſe in others, a thouſand fowle deſires, and a thouſand unhallowed and wicked thoughts.

I ſet before her eyes, the ſad Picture of that which ſhe ſhall be hereafter; to the end, ſhe may not grow proud of that which ſhe is now. There is no hurt in meditating a little upon this poynt. But allow her the liberty we lately tooke from her; yet withall, put her alwayes in minde, that of the foure beauties I have ſhewed her in my <hi>Taſſo;</hi> there is but one of them, that will be a fit example for her to follow. She muſt leave <hi>Armida</hi> and <hi>Erminia,</hi> for the Gallants of the Court, <hi>Clorinda</hi> is for the valorous men of <hi>Gaſcoigne,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigord;</hi> but ſhe that I propoſe for her Patterne, is <hi>Sophronia.</hi> And if ſhe have not courage enough to ſay to the Tyrant, as ſhe ſaid, <hi>It is I that am the Delinquent you looke for,</hi> let her at leaſt, have the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, that are neceſſary to the being her follower, and imitate her in them. This faire Saint made profeſſion of modeſtie, and neglected her beautie; ſhe was alwayes, either hidden under a veile, or ſhut up in her Chamber, and all the world might ſuſpect her to be faire; but there was ſcarce any at all that knew it but her mother. She had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to entrappe any mans liberty, and therefore laid not her ſnares in their way, nor went to Church to ſee and to be ſeene. My deare ſiſter, I cannot chooſe but take upon me here to be a reformer of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt manners, and make my complaint to you, of a Cuſtome, which as well as many other naughtie things, the Court hath caſt upon us. What reaſon is there in the world, that women ſhould enter into holy places, of purpoſe to draw upon them, the view and attention of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:120345:178"/>
Company; as much as to ſay, to trouble and diſturbe the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of a Towne, and to doe as bad, or worſe, as thoſe buyers and ſellers did, whom Chriſt whipped out of the Temple? By this meanes, good actions become evill, and Pietie comes to have no better odour before the Altars, than Perfumes that are muſtie and corrupted. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men now adayes, are bound to be ſeene to be at Church; and this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſire of being ſeene there, is the ordinary prophanation of the place where they are ſeene. And in truth, ſeeing this place is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly called the Houſe of God, what is it but to vilifie God, even in the higheſt degree, to come and offend at his owne doores, and as it were to his face? It is even as great an Impudency, as that of the firſt Angells, who ſinned in Paradiſe. Yet herein certainly, the <hi>Italian</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are more pardonable than the <hi>French;</hi> for they indeed, have no other breathing time of their unfortunate liberty, being at all other times, kept up as ſlaves and priſoners: but in <hi>France,</hi> where women are not denyed the company and viſits of honeſt men, they can have nothing to ſay, in juſtification of this incontinency of their eyes, and of this unſufferable vanitie, to ſeeke to part ſtakes with God, in mens vowes, and to ſhare with him in his publike Adoration. You little thought this morning to heare a Preacher, and I as little thought to be one; but as you ſee, the zeale of Gods Houſe, hath brought me to it; and finding my ſelfe at leiſure, I was deſirous to beſtow part of it upon you The Text was given me yeſterday, by the company that was here; where my Neeces beautie was ſo much extolled, that, ſending you Newes, which are to her ſo glorious, I thought fit to ſend her withall a cooling, to keepe her glorying in ſome temper: and ſo my deare Siſter, I take my leave, and am with all my ſoule,</p>

                     <p>MY deareſt ſiſter, having both of us but one paſſion, it makes us alwayes talking of one thing. My Neece is the ſubject of all our Lettters, as ſhe is the object of all ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:120345:178"/>
and endeavour to imploy it to her profit. You remember a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the other day, who values nothing, likes of nothing, excuſes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and let her be in the beſt and moſt pleaſing company that may be, yet ſhe is ſure to put them all into dumpes and melancholy. You can come on no ſide of her, but ſhe pricks and bites: all her coaſts are craggie and rockie. And it was not without cauſe my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid, that if the man you wot of, had married her, there would certainly have nothing come of that marriage, but Teeth and Nayles. It is impoſſible to live in peace with ſuch a ſavage chaſtitie. I make no more reckoning of it, than of that of the Furies, whom the ancient Poets call virgines, and wonder not, that women of this humour, love no man, ſeeing they hate the whole world. This ſad and ſullen poyſon taking up all the roome in their ſoules, leaves no place at all for other paſſions that are ſweet and pleaſing. They fly pleaſures, rather by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their mouth out of taſte, than by having their judgement in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: and are ſo continually fretting, that they have no leaſure at any time to be merrie. As long as they be chaſt, they thinke they may lawfully be diſcourteous, and ſcratch men, ſo they doe not kiſſe them. They have a conceit, that by wanting one vice, they have preſently all vertues: and that for a little good fame they gaine to their husbands, they may keepe them under yoake, and affront all mankinde. It is true, the loſſe of a womans honour is the greateſt diſgrace ſhe can poſſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre; and which once loſt, ſhe hath nothing left her that is worth the keeping: But yet it followes not, that the preſerving it, is any ſuch royall act; and I doe not admire any, for not being willing to live in miſery and diſgrace. I never heard, that a woman ſhould be praiſed, for not falling in the fire, or for not caſting her ſelfe downe a rock. We condemne the memorie of them that kill themſelves; but we give no reward to them that preſerve themſlves. And ſo indeed it is, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that magnifies her ſelfe for being chaſt, magnifies her ſelfe for not being dead, and for having a quality, without which ſhe were as good be out of the world, ſeeing ſhe ſtayes not in it, but for a plague to her name, and to ſee her owne infamie. I ſay yet more, that ſhe ought not ſo much to conſider the vice as an evill thing, as to conſider it as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible thing, and not to have it ſo much in deteſtation, as in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. For indeed, if a woman be truly vertuous, She will ſooner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there are Maremaids and Centaures, than that there are any diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt women: but will rather conceive that the world is given to ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, and that Fame is a lyer, than that her neighbour is falſe and diſloyall to her husband: though with her owne eyes ſhe ſhould ſee the fault committed, yet it is her part to ſuſpect her eyes were miſtaken, and that it was but an illuſion which ſhe ſaw; at leaſt, ſhe ſhould never give ſentence upon this ſort of delinquents, ſeeing Chriſt himſelfe would
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:120345:179"/>
not doe it to the adulterous woman. When others wrong a woman, it is her part to be ſorry: and when others ſay, ſhe hath beene un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull, it may be enough for her to ſay, ſhe hath been unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. And yet more than this too, I could wiſh, if it were poſſible, that where ſhe findes moſt weakeneſſe, there ſhe ſhould ſhew moſt goodneſſe; and I would not, that vertue ſhould beget this bad qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ity. It is an enemy to ſociety, and deſerve not to have ſo good a mother: and one may well flie and blame the vice, ſo as the flying it, be without oſtentation, and the blaming it be without choler. For otherwiſe, it would be as much as to require a ſtatue for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing; and in the ſmart of the puniſhment, to ſeeke for the pleaſure of revenge. An honeſt woman reformes the world by the example of her life, and not by the violence of her ſpirit. She ought not to proclaime warre againſt any; not againſt the moſt indiſcreet and inſolent: and if there chance any licentious or uncivill word to be uttered in her hearing, ſhe ought to checke it, either by giving no care, or by falling into ſome other diſcourſe, or by caſting upon the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker a beams of modeſty, that may c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> offending. There is as well a ſeverity in modeſty, as a ſweetneſſe, and which keepes inſolency it ſelfe in awe: and a woman that carries this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vertue in her eyes, keepes men within the bounds of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This honeſt bluſh, which is ſo pleaſing a thing in maidens faces, and which I diſtinguiſh from that, which is ſottiſh and untoward, is a barre, and ſufficient defence againſt the audaciouſneſſe or the moſt impudent; and when it is ſeen to ſhine in a womans looke, there is no licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſſe that is not dazeled with it, and is not ſtopt from daring to proceed. And therefore there is no neceſſity of uſing any ſtraining of the voyce, any churliſhneſſe of words, or any agitation of geſtures, to doe that, which may better be done by ſilence, and with quietneſſe.

I have heard ſome of them complaine, that the ſcent of a Roſe was too ſtrong, and that Musk made their heads ake, becauſe it had not milde ſweetneſs enough: and why then will they not take that ſweetneſſe into themſelves, which they ſeeke for ſo much in other things? and finde fault with the want of it in that Art, which propoſeth to it ſelfe no other end? if without this ſweetneſſe, there grow from the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious odour, a certaine quality which offends them; and if there be ſome Flowers, and ſome Perfumes that pleaſe them not, what likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is there, that Brimſtone and Salt-peter can pleaſe them, and that their humour can have any thing common with theſe violent ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?

Onely thoſe perſons that can revenge offences, may venture to give offences; and one that will give the lye, muſt be of a condition to fight a Duell, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it by Armes. My Neece hath no great need of theſe precepts, nor indeed of any forraigne inſtruction; ſhe cannot wander from the right, if ſhe goe not aſtray from her owne inclination; nor can be troubleſome to others, if ſhee borrow not a vice which is none of her owne. I have therefore repreſented to her, the woman of the other day: but after their example, who ſhewed their ſlaves drunke to their Children, and that is to make her afraid of filthy Objects, and to make that hatefull to her, which is not in it ſelfe lovely; to confirme her in the principles which you have taught her, and to draw her out ſome rules from her owne action: She is (I know) naturally good; but the beſt natures have need of ſome method to guide them, and direction doth never any hurt to vertue: ſhe is able to keep her ſelfe in termes extremely obliging, without ever falling into the baſeneſſe of flattery: She is able to pleaſe without colloguing; and although ſhe call not every thing by the right name; nor be ſo very curious to ſpeak in proper termes, yet her ſtile ſhall not for that, be the leſſe liked, nor her company the leſſe deſired. ſhe may call them wiſe that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:120345:180"/>
want the reputation of being valiant; and women that are ſad; ſhe may ſay they are ſerious. If a man be not of a quick ſpirit, ſhe may ſay, he is of a good judgement: and if one be unfortunate in his actions, ſhe may yet ſay, he hath a good meaning in his counſails But yet in this there is a meaſure to be held, and a choyce muſt be made, in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her colours, that ſhe ſeeke not to diſguiſe all ſorts of ſubjects: for there are ſome indeed that are not capable of diſguiſing. Thoſe that are pale, ſhe may praiſe for their whiteneſſe: but thoſe that have a dropſie, ſhe muſt not praiſe for their fatneſſe: ſhe may ſay, that ſcruple is a bud of pietie, but ſhe muſt not ſay, that prophaneneſſe is an effect of Phyloſophie. She may make a favourable conſtruction of things doubtfull, and ſweeten the rigour of particular judgements; but ſhe muſt not contend againſt common ſence, nor be oppoſite to verities that are publicke and manifeſt. She muſt make a difference betweene errours and crimes, betweene a docible ſimplicitie and a preſumptuous ſtupiditie, betweene ſots that are honeſt, and thoſe that are wicked. And if ſhe happen to be in company, where ſome weake ſpirit is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, as the world is full of ſuch that will triumph over the weak, and take no pittie of any, ſhe muſt then, by all meanes, be a protectreſſe of ſuch a one, and make her ſelfe a Sanctuary for all thoſe, whom ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger adverſaties would otherwiſe ruine. This onely is to be obſerved, that ſhe ſo undertake the maintaining of weake cauſes, that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the tune of her voyce, that it proceeds from exceſſe of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and not from want of knowledge: and that ſhe compaſſionates humane infirmities by an act of charity, but makes not her ſelfe a party by falſe perſwaſion. I am now at the end of my paper; and ſhould have beene a good while ſince at the end of my letter: but I alwayes forget my ſelfe when I am with you, and never thinke howers ſhorter, than thoſe I beſtow upon your memorie.

I deny not, but the victorious and triumphant Newes, that comes continually from the Armie, gives me ſome reſentment of joy, and that the brute of your Name in all quarters, toucheth me very ſenſibly; but it is no perfect ſatisfaction to me, to learne that by others relating, which I ought to know as an eye-witneſſe, and I conceive ſo great a pleaſure to conſiſt in the ſight of your glory, that there is not a common ſouldier under your Command, whoſe happineſſe and good fortune, I doe not envie. But my Lord, though I cannot ſerve you with my bodily acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet I revere you day and night, with the thoughts of my minde, and in this ſo worthy an imployment, I never thinke the nobleſt part of my ſelfe, can doe ſervice enough. Your Lordſhip, next to the King, is the eternall object of my ſpirit, I never turne my eyes from the courſe of your life; and if perhaps, you have Courtiers more officious than my ſelfe, and ſuch as doe their duties with greater oſtentation and ſhew,

yet I am moſt ſure, you have no ſervant that is more faithfull, and whoſe affection comes more truely from his heart, and is fuller of life and vigour. But to the end, my words may not be thought vaine, and without ground, I ſend you now a proofe of that I ſay, by which, you ſhall perceive, that a man that is himſelfe perſwaded, hath a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to perſwade others, and that a Diſcourſe, founded upon the things themſelves, and animated with the truth, both ſtirres mens ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits with greater force, and alſo begets a firmer beliefe, than that which is but feigned, and comes but in the nature of Declayming.

In it, there is handled, Of the vertue, and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the King; Of the Juſtice of his Armes; Of Royalty and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; Of uſurpers and lawfull Princes; Of Rebellion chaſtened, and liberty mainteined; but becauſe the Prince I ſpeake of, is a ſtirrer, and makes no ſtay any where, and that in following him, I ſhould imbarque my ſelfe in a world of ſeverall ſubjects; I have therefore, preſcribed to my ſelfe certaine bounds, which in his actions, I ſhould never have met with: and after the example of <hi>Homer,</hi> who finiſhed his <hi>Ilias</hi> with the death of <hi>Hector,</hi> though that were not the end of the warre; I have thought fit, not to goe further, than the taking of <hi>Size,</hi> though this were but the beginning of the wonder, we have ſeene of his. You know my Lord, that this kinde of writing, which I propoſe to my ſelfe, is without compariſon, the moſt painefull of all other; and that it is a hard matter, to continue long in an action that muſt be violent, and to be violent in an action that muſt continue long. This prayſe belongs properly to <hi>Oratours,</hi> I meane ſuch as know how to perſwade, how to pleaſe in profiting; and can make the people capable of the ſecrets of Governing a Common-wealth. For as for Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, that have written of this argument, their diſcourſe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſo dry and meager, that it appeares, their intention was rather to inſtruct, than to pleaſe; and beſides, their ſtyle is ſo thornie and cumberſome, that it ſeemes they meant to teach none, but the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And in this, there is no more difficulty, than there is in healing of men that be in health. And for a man, to make himſelfe obſcure, there needs no more, but to ſtay upon the firſt notions we have of truth, which are never, either wholly pure nor well unfolded, and which falling from the imagination upon paper, leave upon it ſuch a confuſion, that it reſembles rather an informed abortion, than a perfect production. Beſides, in the compoſition of a Hiſtory, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally where the Politiques have to doe, an Authour is carried, and

borne out by his matter, and the things being all made to his hand, which eaſe him of the paines of invention, as the order of the time eaſeth him of the care of diſpoſing: he hath little to doe for his part, but onely to contribute words, which is by ſome made ſo ſmall a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that when <hi>Menander</hi> was preſſed by ſome friends to publiſh a worke of his, that he had promiſed: He made anſwer, it ſhall preſently come forth; for it is in a manner all finiſhed and ready, there wants nothing, but to make the words. But in the perſwaſive kinde of writing (beſides, that there muſt be a better choice made, and a ſtricter order uſed, in placing the words, than in ſimple Narrations, which for all their luſtre and riches of expreſſion, require no more but plainneſſe, and fit termes) they which deſire to attaine perfection, or indeed to doe any thing at all of worth, endeavour all they can, to put in uſe, and reduce to action, the moſt ſubtile <hi>Idaea's</hi> of all Rhetorick; to raiſe up their underſtanding to the higheſt poynt of things; to ſearch out, in every matter, the verities leſſe expoſed to view, and to make them ſo familiar, that they who perceived them not before, may by their relation come as it were to touch them Their deſigne is, to joyne pleaſure to profit, to mingle daintineſſe and plenty together; and to fight with Armes, not onely firme and ſtrong, but alſo faire and glittering. They endeavour to civilize Learning; draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from the Colledge, and freeing it from the hands of Pedants, who marre and ſully it in handling: and to ſay the truth, adulterate, and corrupt it, abuſing this excellent and delicate thing in the ſight of all the world. They ſeeke not to avoide Rockes by turning aſide from them, but rather by ſlyding gently over them, and rather to eſcape places of danger, than to ſhunne them. And to make it appeare, that nothing is ſo ſowre or bitter, but that it may be ſweetned and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed by Diſcourſe. Finally, they ſuffer themſelves ſometimes to be tranſported with that reaſonable ſury, which Rhetoricians have well knowne, though it goe beyond their Rules and Precepts: which thruſt an Oratour into ſuch ſtrange and uncouth motions, that they ſeeme rather inſpired, than to be naturall; and with which, <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> were ſo poſſeſſed, that the one of them ſweares by thoſe that dyed at <hi>Marathon,</hi> and of his owne authority makes them Gods: the other, askes queſtions of the Hilles and Forreſts of <hi>Alba,</hi> as if they had eares, and were able to heare him. But if I were one that did come any thing neere ſo noble an end, (which I neither will nor dare beleive) and that I were able to make ſtrangers ſee, that all things in <hi>France</hi> are changed for the better, ſince the happy Reigne of our King, who no leſſe augmenteth our ſpirits, than he encreaſeth our courage: yet it is not I that ſhould merit the glory of this, but I muſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attribute it to the happineſſe of my time, and to the force of my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.

Howſoever, my Lord, if I cannot be taken into the Liſt of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and able men, at leaſt, I cannot be denyed a place amongſt honeſt men, and loyall ſervants; and if my abilities be worthy of no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration with you, at leaſt, my zeale and affection, are better worth, than to be rejected. With which meditation, I am ſometimes ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed, that I doubt not, but my reſentments muſt needs content you; and that it is no unpleaſing recreation to you, to caſt your eye upon a Philoſopher in choler. And though true love content it ſelfe with the teſtimony of its owne Conſcience: and that I give you many proofes of my moſt humble ſervice, which I aſſure my ſelfe, will never come to your knowledge; yet for your ſatiſfaction, I deſire you might heare me ſometimes in the place where you are, and might ſee, with what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, I maintaine the publike cauſe, in what manner I controll falſe Newes that runs about, and how I ſtop their mouthes that will be tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in diſparagement of our affaires. It is certaine, that it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our State ſhould be more flouriſhing than it is, or that the ſucceſſe of the Kings Armes ſhould be more glorious than it is, or that the Peace of the People ſhould be more aſſured than it is, or that your Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be more judicious than it is; and yet we meete with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpirits, that are troubled with their owne quietneſſe, are impatient of their owne felicitie, cannot be held in any good beliefe, but by proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perities that are ſupernaturall; and longer than they ſee miracles, give no credit to any thing. If preſent affaires be in good termes, then they caſt out feares of thoſe to come; and when they ſee the events prove happie, then they fall affrighting us with Preſages. They take an Oath, to eſteeme of no perſons, but forreyners; of no things, but farre ſet. They admire <hi>Spinola,</hi> becauſe he is an <hi>Italian,</hi> and their enemie; they cannot abide to praiſe the King, becauſe he is a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and their Maſter. They will hardly be drawne to confeſſe, that the King hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, though they ſee before their eyes, an infinite number of Townes taken; of Factions ruinated, eternall Monuments of his Victories: and more eaſily the King hath gotten the applauſe of all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> than theſe mens approbation. They would perſwade us, If they could, that he had raiſed his Siege before <hi>Rochell;</hi> That he had made a ſhamefull Peace with the Proteſtants; and that the Spaniards had made him run away. They doe all they can, to exterminate his Hiſtory, and to extinguiſh the greateſt light that ſhall ever ſhine to poſteritie.

They can like well enough, that againſt the credit of all Antiquity, <hi>Xenophon</hi> being a <hi>Graecian,</hi> and no <hi>Perſian,</hi> ſhould frame <hi>Cyrus</hi> a life after his owne fancie, and make him die in his bed, and amongſt his Friends; when yet he dyed in the warres, and overcome by a woman: and they can like well enough, that <hi>Plinie</hi> ſhould tell a lye in open Senate, and praiſe <hi>Trajan</hi> for temperance and chaſtitie, who yet was given to wine, and to another vice ſo fowle that it cannot honeſtly be named, but they can by no meanes like, that I, who am the Kings ſubject born, ſhould ſay that of him, which no man can deny to be moſt true, and that being to make a patern for Princes, I ſhould rather make choice of his life, than either of that of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which is fabulous; or that of <hi>Trajan,</hi> which is not the pureſt, that I may not ſpeake of that of <hi>Caeſar Bogia,</hi> which is all blacke with licentiouſneſſe and crimes.

Becauſe ſome of our Kings have made unfortunate voyages beyond the mountaines, therefore they will needs have it, that our King, though he follow not their counſels, ſhould yet fall into their misfortunes. They accuſe your conduct with old proverbs, becauſe they cannot with ſound reaſons. They ſay, <hi>Italy</hi> is the Church yard of the <hi>French:</hi> and being not able to obſerve the leaſt fault in all your carriage in that countrey, they lay upon you the faults of our aunceſtors, and charge you with the errour of <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth. Yet I conceive that theſe mens ſinne is rather of infirmity than of malice, that they are rather paſſionate for their opinions, than Penſioners of our enemies; and that they have more need of helpe by Phyſick, than of reſtraint by Law. But it is a grievous thing to ſee, how the buſie-bodyes of our time, ſpeake the ſame language, which Rebells did in times paſt; and abuſe the happineſſe of liberty, even againſt him, who hath procured it unto us. They come continually, and tell me, we are like to receive much prejudice by the diſcontent of ſuch a Prince, that is gone from our ſide. And I anſwer them, it is better to have a weake enemy to fight withall, than a quarrelſome friend to make much of. They will by all meanes, that the King at any price, ſhould ſuccour <hi>Cazall;</hi> and I tell them, that he hath ſuccoured it already, by his conqueſt of <hi>Savoy:</hi> and that in the ſtate as things now ſtand, it cannot be taken, but to be delivered

I learne the progreſſe of his glorious actions by the mouth of Fame: but I muſt learne from you how he fares in his continuall agitation; and whether the temper of his body feele no alteration by the violent motions of his ſpirit, I conceive
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:120345:185"/>
that God doubles his force when there is need; and that he hath regard to the neceſſity of ſo many people that cannot miſſe him: but I know alſo, that he makes uſe of the ſecond cauſes, and that your cares and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry concur with this providence. The ſervices you doe to one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man, are obligations to all the world. Never had any Science a more worthy or profitable imployment than yours hath: And if the Romanes erected a ſtatue to <hi>Antonius Muſa,</hi> for healing of him who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their liberty, why may not you juſtly expect a publick acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement for preſerving of him, who makes us all both free and happy? I ſend him the diſcourſes which — I humbly entreate you to take care they may come to no other hands but his: and therefore that you will keepe them in your cuſtodie, that they may be ſafe untill I come my ſelfe to <hi>Paris.</hi> I expect this courteſie from that good will you have alwayes promiſed me: and here I make you this ſolemne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, that you can never honour any man that is more paſſionately than I am.</p>

                     <p>SIR, it is a great work of memorie to be mindefull of me at the Court: but it is an effect of a divine goodneſſe to make it raine dainties in the deſart: Since Manna, there was never ſeene there, ſuch a thing as you ſent me; and if you were bound to furniſh me with ſuch fare, fortie yeares of baniſhment at this diet, would be to me fortie yeares felicitie. To ſpeake in plaine tearmes, your preſent is unvaluable: and to helpe my ſelfe in ſpeaking of it, I have beene foreed to fetch compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons from heaven, becauſe inferiour things are never able to expreſſe it. You doe it wrong to give it the name of a Preface: but you will doe much wrong to the worke it ſelfe, before which ſuch a preface is ſet: If the outſide be ſo rich, and there be ſo great magnificence in the Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, what will be in the Galleries, and Cabinets? and what will the Palace be that is worthie of ſuch an entrance? I ſee indeed that it is a mark of greatneſſe, but I feare withall, that it is a want of proportion, and being not poſſible the reſt ſhould equall the beginning, you will be accuſed for diſturbing the order of things, and for putting perfection out of its place, which ſhould not come in but at the laſt. See here an
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:120345:185"/>
accuſation that is very nice, and whereof it is a glory to be convinced. In this there is leſſe account to be made of vertue than of vice; and the diſorder which makes a magnificence, is more worth than the method which retaines a poverty. Feare not Sir, the event of this diſpute; Beauty gets the prize in all cauſes where the Eyes are Judges: and they who blame you for adorning too much your refutation of the Bookes of <hi>Flanders,</hi> blame you for having your Armour too much guilded, and that in ſtriking you dazle their eyes. It ſeemes they know not that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> never tricked up themſelves, but when they went to fight; and that <hi>CAESAR</hi> made his vaunt, he wan Battailes with perfumed Souldiers. The pompe of your ſtyle arreſts not the ſight without profit: It is pleaſing to the Reader; but withall it is fatall to ſlander. In it there is to be ſeene the luſtre and bravery of Tournaments; but withall, there is to be ſeene in it the force and terribleneſſe of Warre. The onely pitty is, you had not a competent Enemie to fight withall, and that ſo much force and valour ſhould be ſpent upon a feeble fury, and which is now at the laſt drop of its poyſon. The wretched man you purſue, and who dyes blaſpheming, was not worthie of ſo noble a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment as yours, having nothing conſiderable in him, but that you vouchſafe to ſpeake of him: you make him of ſome worth by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him ſo often. In undoing him, you make him famous, and his objections will one day not be found, but in your anſweres. It is five and twentie yeares ſince he was a fugitive from his order, and ſhould have had his triall before the Generall of the Jeſuites. And if theſe good Fathers did not deale too gently with delinquents, and change impriſonment into baniſhment, he had from that time beene ſuppreſſed, with all the filthy bookes he hath made ever ſince. But it was neceſſary, that (to crowne his inconſtancie) after he had abandoned above a dozen ſides, he ſhould now for his laſt prize, become a paraſite to the Spaniards, and a Secretary to thoſe bad French that are at their Court. Let it never trouble us Sir, that he calles us Flatterers: Atheiſts call honeſt men ſuperſtitious. <hi>Catiline</hi> called them all ſlaves that would not be parricides; and it hath alwayes been impoſſible, to be vertuous with approbation of the wicked. They are delinquents themſelves, that finde fault with our innocency, and they are idle fellowes, who proſtrate themſelves every day before a <hi>Don Dego,</hi> or a <hi>Don Roderigo,</hi> and yet thinke much we ſhould doe any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to M. the Cardinall <hi>Richlieu.</hi> But it is fit they ſhould be taught, that here is the true worſhip, at <hi>Bruxells</hi> but Idolatrie; and that to adore a forreigne Power, and ſuch a one that doth miſchiefe to the whole earth, is not, at leaſt an action ſo truly <hi>French,</hi> as to revere a vertue, that is native of <hi>France,</hi> and that doth good to all the world.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:120345:186"/>
Seeing they abuſe our tongue in praiſing their Tyrants, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying our Rebells; It cannot be denyed us, to bring it backe to its naturall and proper uſe, and in more honeſt ſubjects, to purifie and make cleane thoſe words and phraſes, which they have proſtituted to the conceits of the Marquis of <hi>Aytona,</hi> or made to ſerve the paſſion of <hi>Spaine.</hi> If tyranny were more to be feared than it is, and that the unfortunateneſſe of <hi>Europe</hi> ſhould make it reach hither; yet it ſhould never make me to unſay the propoſitions I hold, and it ſhall be all my life a moſt pleaſing object to me, to ſee my ſelfe enrolled in the Catalogue of Authours, condemned by the enemies of my Countrey. I thinke, I may boldly ſay, I was one of the firſt mainteiners of the truth, and he perhaps that laid open the field, where ſo many Oratours and Poets finde themſelves exerciſe: it is time now, that I leave it to younger men, and ſuch as are more able than I am. Yet I intreat you to remember Sir, that I give place without running away; and that it is the coldneſſe of my bloud, and the abatement of my ſtrength, that forceth me, and not any want of courage or change of will. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thinke I will ever faile in theſe. I alwayes preſerve in my heart the principles of good actions, I meane, good deſires; and when I can no longer be a runner in the Race, yet I will be one of the moſt earneſt Spectatours, and clappe with my hands when I can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. In the meane time, to the end, that a good part of my antient travaile may not be loſt, and that I may not make that an unprofitable ſecret, betweene my Muſes and me, which may perhaps ſerve for ſome edification to the Publicke. I think, fit, to make you account of certaine things I have heretofore conceived; and to ſhew you, that in actions of my duty, I oftentimes content my ſelfe with the teſtimony of my owne Conſcience. Theſe are Pieces that were wrought before the ſecond voyage into <hi>Italy,</hi> and before the lamentable Diviſions of the Royall Familie. In the purity of publick joy amidſt the applauſes of all the Kings ſubjects; and even of thoſe, who have ſince loſt their loyaltie, and now lye rayling upon us at <hi>Bruxells.</hi> I ſend you ſome ſheets, as I firſt light upon them, and I ſend them Sir, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to doe you Homage by laying my Compoſitions at your feete, than to make a Challenge, as oppoſing them to yours, rather to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the ſuperioritie of your Eloquence, and to goe in your Lyverie, than to make my ſelfe you<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Competitor, and ſeeke to brave you, with ſo raſh a Compariſon. If you finde any relliſh in Diſcourſes ſo farre ſhort of the force and merit of yours; and if you thinke they may give my Maſters of the Univerſitie, any the leaſt contentment, I earneſtly entreate you, to preſent them a Copy; and withall, my humble ſubmiſſion to their judgement. I know, this Societie is at this day the ſupreme Tribunall that Cenſures all workes of the Braine,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:120345:186"/>
and gives Rules to all other Tribunalls of <hi>France.</hi> I neither doubt of the ſufficiencie, nor ſuſpect the integritie of the Judges that praeſide there: Moreover, I confeſſe Sir, it could never have a more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie Conception, ſeeing your ſelfe was the firſt that ſpake it, nor a more illuſtrious birth, ſeeing M. the Cardinall was a Patron to it; and therefore, borne in Purple, as were thoſe Princes in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whom I would call, <hi>Porphyrogencies,</hi> if the Academie had Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſed this Forreigne word. The honour it hath done me, to make me a member of their body, without binding me to part from hence, and the place it hath given me, without taking away my liberty, are two ſingular favours I received from it, both at one time. And to ſay the truth, it is no ſmall benefit to a man of the wilderneſſe, that turnts his face ſometimes towards the world, and is not altogether deveſted of humane affections, that he may injoy together, both the repoſe of ſolitude, and yet flatter his imagination with the glory of ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Societie. This I cannot doe without thanking you for ſo great a favour; and if they underſtand not of my Reſentment by your mouth, they may have juſt cauſe to condemne me for one of little Grateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Lend me therefore, I beſeech you Sir, ſome five or ſix words, I would ask you more, but I know they are of that worth, and ſo high in their account, that theſe few will be enough, not onely to ſatisfie for the complement I owe; but for the Oration alſo, it is expected I ſhould make them. You will not, I hope, deny me the teſtimony of your love, and I require it of you by the memory of the other Obligations I owe you. <hi>At<expan>

To make this man a Preſent, the Poet you wot of, made lately ſome Verſes upon the eſtate of affaires in <hi>Lorrayne,</hi> and anſwers another Poet, who had written, that the King would never be able to hold it, and that the rellicke of affection, which the Countrey beares to its ancient Duke, would never ſuffer any familiaritie or friendſhip to reflect upon us. The — that are the Latins of this Countrey, would make him believe, that he hath found a meane betweene the Character of <hi>Catullus,</hi> and that of <hi>Martiall,</hi> and that he hath avoided the drineſſe and harſhneſſe of the former times, without engaging himſelfe in the luxurie and intemperance of the latter times. With theſe new Verſes, I ſend you the old Proſe you deſired, and which hath lyen ſo long aſleepe in my Cloſet. Though they be writings of an old dare, yet you know, they are alwayes in ſeaſon; and ſeeing they entreate of the ſoveraigne vertue, that is of M. the Cardinall, they intreate of a matter that is immortall, and can never loſe the grace of being new. <hi>Thermopylae</hi> and <hi>Platea,</hi> are to this day the common places of the <hi>Graecians</hi> that are in the world; and our remoteſt poſteritie, which ſhall more quietly enjoy the labours of this rare man, than we doe; ſhall ſpeake more often, and more honou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With ſuch a friendſhip, I can mocke at ill fortune, and it makes me taſte contentments, which good fortune knowes not of. It is true, that your abſence is a perpetuall cooling Card to my joy; and poſſeſſing you but in ſpirit, it requires a very ſtrong imagination, to deſire nothing elſe.

Shall my Counſayle be alwayes twenty myles from me? and muſt I be alwayes forced to paſſe two Seas to fetch it when I need it? I hope your juſtice will doe me reaſon, and that Heaven will at laſt heare the moſt ardent of all my prayers; but in the meane time, whilſt I ſtay waiting for ſo perfect a contentment, I would be glad to have of it now and then, ſome little taſte: if it be not in your power to give your ſelfe; at leaſt lend your ſelfe for ſome few dayes, and come and ſit as ſupreame Preſident, over both my <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi> I promiſe you, I will never appeale

I will make you Sir, no ſtudied Proteſtations, nor ſend complements to a man that is borne in the Countrey of good words; I will onely ſay, there are many reſpects that make your perſon dear unto me: and that beſides the conſideration

                     <p>MY Lord, the joy I take in the recoverie of your health, is not yet ſo pure, but that it alwayes repreſents unto me a terrible Image of your laſt ſickneſſe. The imagination of a danger, though paſt and gone, yet makes my memorie afraid, and I looke upon it rather in ſafety, than with aſſurance. We miſſed the loſing you but very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly: and you were upon the poynt to leave us Orphans. I ſpeake it ſeriouſly, and without any flattery at all, all the victories we have gotten, or ſhall get, would never be able to make us amends for ſuch a loſſe: you wouldd have made our conqueſt turne to mourning: M. the Cardinall would have found ſomething to complaine of in his great felicitie, and would have watred his triumph with his tears. Let it not be Gods will to lay this croſſe upon our time: and if it be a croſſe inevitable, yet let it be deferred to our poſteritie. It is neceſſary

Love therefore your ſelfe a little for our ſakes; begin now at laſt to ſtudie your health, which hitherto you have neglected, and make a difference hereafter betweene cold and heate, betweene good and bad aire; betweene meates that are ſweet, and thoſe that are bitter.

                        <p>SIR, <hi>I</hi> have been in extaſie to heare of your health, and that you keepe your body in that reaſonable fulneſſe of fleſh, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes ſomething to your gravity, and addes nothing to your weight. <hi>I</hi> would not wiſh you to ſeeke to abate it, nor long to be like the dry and tawnie skinnes of the firſt Chriſtians.

ſaying, all Saints have not beene leane and melancholick. The laſt that we have ſeene, were of your colour and ſtatute; and you doe an honour to Divinity, to preach it with a bright viſage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting in ſome ſort the ſtateof future glory you ſpeake of to the people. Monſieur de — made me ſo rich a deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of your health, that I could not chooſe but begin my letter with this complement. I have ſeen ſince Monſieur de — who delivered me one from you, and with it our friends booke, for which I thank you with all my heart. I have yet peruſed onely ſome Tracts, which in truth ſeem very learned, and are as intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible as the obſcurity of the matter would well beare. It is true, the Title deceived me; and ſeeing you will have me ſpeake freely what I thinke, I muſt tell you, I thinke they are nothing elſe than Orations, and that they are fitter to be read upon a Joyn-ſtoole, than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced at a Tribunall. I had thought to have found in them the perſwaſive motives of Oratours, in the higheſt ſtraine of their ſtile, and I finde nothing but the drye doctrine of Philoſophers, and of them neither, nothing but the ordinary language of their precepts; that it makes me think of theſe new Companies of Souldiers which are levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the name of Horſe, but are put to ſerve on foot, when they come to the Armie. I ſay not, it is neceſſary to handle Schoole queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with all the pompe and force of eloquence, I onely ſay, that ſuch diſcourſes ought not to be called Panaegiricks, or O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe are Ornaments ſo vulgar and ſo ſtale, that to uſe them at this day, is rather a mark of Clowniſhneſſe, than of neatneſſe. When faſhions are left off in the City, they are then taken up in the Country; and there are none now but poore Gentlemen, that will offer to weare the maſſieſt ſilver lace, when it is once fitterd, or the richeſt Pluſh, when it is once growne thred-bare, Both the one and the other have been in faſhion, but they are not ſo now. They were heretofore novelties, but are now but Rellicks: The firſt compariſon that was made of the burning of Dianaes Temple, was excellent: all other ſince have beene but idle.

I cannot but exceedingly eſteeme of that, which repreſents it to me. I have oftentimes told you, that you are naturally eloquent; but yet I muſt confeſſe you have gotten new graces, by being in <hi>Ciceroes</hi> countrey, and the Aire of <hi>Rome</hi> ſeemes to have purged your ſpirit, of all vulgar conceits.

Your laſt Letter renues in me my old loves, and makes me with ſo much pleaſure, remember the ſweeteſt part of the earth, that I even die with longing, till I ſee it againe. It is a long time that <hi>Italy</hi> hath had my heart, and that I ſigh after that happy cowardiſe with which the valiant reproach the wiſe.

I have beene for ſome time ſo unfortunate in friendſhip; that it ſeemes there needes nothing but pretences to ridde me of them; the ſweeteſt natures grow ſoure and bitter againſt me; and if this fit hold, I ſhall have much adoe to keepe my owne brother of my ſide. I would like as well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be a keeper of the Lyons, as of ſuch harſh friends; for though I were more faithfull than <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Acates</hi> put together; yet they would finde matter of diſcontentment; and my fidelity ſhould

Theſe ſixe moneths <hi>I</hi> have received from you but onely one Letter, to which <hi>I</hi> made no anſwer, becauſe it was delivered me but in <hi>April:</hi> at which time, you ſent me word you ſhould be in <hi>France.</hi> Since therefore by your owne account, you were gone from thence, before the time <hi>I</hi> could write unto you, would you, <hi>I</hi> ſhould have written into <hi>Italy</hi> to Monſieur <hi>de Silhon,</hi> that was not there? And that <hi>I</hi> ſhould have directed my Letters to a name, without either hands or eyes to receive and read them? You are too wiſe to deale ſo unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably with me, and I ſhould call your former juſtice in queſtion, if you take it ill, that <hi>I</hi> did not gueſſe, or rather propheſie of the ſtay of your voyage: and yet after a ſcrupulous examination of my conſcience, <hi>I</hi> can finde no other ground for your complaints, but onely this, and <hi>I</hi> am aſhamed to charge ſo ſtrong a ſpirit as yours, with ſo weak a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit: <hi>I</hi> muſt have had a devill at command to ſend of my errands, and to deliver you my Letters, being ſo uncertaine as I was, of the place of your abode, and in truth, if I had had ſuch a meſſenger, I had ſooner thanked you, than I doe, for your excellent diſcourſe: and ſhould not all this while, have kept within the ſecret of my heart, the juſt praiſes it deſerves. It hath taught me, Sir, an infinite number of good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes; the ſtile pleaſeth me exceedingly, and I ſee in it both force and beauty, thorough all the paſſages, even that paſſage which did not ſo fully pleaſe me, yet hath as fully ſatisfied me, as the reſt of the worke: and though of my ſelfe I be blinde in the knowledge of holy things, yet the luſtre of your expreſſing, and the facility of your method illuminate my ſight. When my health ſhall give me leave to goe from hence, I will then for your Gold bring you Copper, and will receive your corrections and adviſe, with as much reverence and ſubmiſſion, as any Novice: but in the meane time, I cannot chuſe but put my hand to my wound, and require you to give a reaſon of your doing. I know not from whence ſhould come this coldneſſe in you, ſeeing for my ſelfe, I am all on fire: nor how you, with your great wiſdome, ſhould be altered and growne another man, ſeeing I continue ſtill the ſame, with nothing but my common ſenſe: Great ſpirits are above theſe petty ſuſpitions which move the vulgar: and I wonder you could conceive ill of my affection, knowing how well you had preſerved your owne.

Give me leave to live: a man that cannot be loſt, what negligence ſoever be uſed in keeping me; and remember that the leaſt reſpected of all my friends is much dearer to me, than all Sciences, or all Bookes. Yet ſuch is my unhappineſſe, that few of them returne me the like, but ſeeme rather they would make a benefit of my paines and ſorrowes. Becauſe they ſee I am perſecuted, they will make every the leaſt courteſie they doe me, to be of great value, and ſet an exceſſive price upon their friendſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they imagine I ſtand in need of it. But I deſire them, and you alſo, to take notice, that my friendſhip was never grounded upon any intereſt; but my love is ever without any mercenary deſigne, or hope of benefit. If they be not willing to embroyle themſelves in my affaires, I would have them know, I am as unwilling as they, they ſhould: and if they are not ſtrong enough to defend the truth in publique, and when it is oppoſed; at leaſt let them not diſavow it, when they are in place of ſafety; let them not deny their friend when the ſtorme is over, and that there is no longer any danger in confeſſing him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You ſaw my heart, the firſt time you ſaw my face; you were at that time my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour; and I have not a ſinne that is hidden from you. I conceive you are too generous to make advantage of this exceſſe of freeneſſe you finde in me; and I doe not thinke you ſo ſubtile, that you would make a ſhew of diſcontent, for feare leaſt I ſhould beginne firſt. Theſe are ſubtilities indeed of the country from whence you come: but in my opinion very remote from your naturall diſpoſition: and you need not make complaints of me, to prevent the complaints I might elſe make of you. It is certaine, that if I had not equity enough to excuſe my friends for things they were not able to perfome; I might then perhaps have colour to complaine they performed not their promiſe; but I am one, that know there happen a thouſand impediments, which hinder a man from keeping his word, and that every thing that is promiſed and not done, is not preſently a violating of faith, or a breaking of promiſe. Some have laboured to perſwade me, 
that —: but I never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved any ſuch thing, and I could never imagine that you would goe about to build your reputation upon the ruines of the reputation of your friend. If any ſhall make uſe of ſuch like artifices, to doe ill offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betweene you and me. I earneſtly intreate you to make uſe of the like remedies, to preſerve your opinions ſound, and not to ſuffer your judgement to be corrupted. I take God to witneſſe, there is nothing in the world more deare unto me than your friendſhip; I make publike and open profeſſion of honouring you: I highly eſteeme a number of

                     <p>SIR, having taken the paines that I have done, I cannot altogether diſvalue my worke; yet I am not a little glad to be confirmed in my opinion by a man of your worth: and that my labour is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to the ſoundeſt judgement. The ſecond cenſure you make of it, aſſures me of the integrity of the firſt; ſeeing I ſhould be too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous to believe you could be deceived twice together. But let us ſtay there I beſeech you, and think not, I will ever entertain the vanity you put upon me. I neither pretend to inſtruct the world, nor take upon me to teach you in any thing; it is enough for me, that I can finde wiſe men ſome recreation; and can lay things before your eyes, which you know already better than my ſelfe. <hi>I</hi> may perhaps be ſome help to your memory, and refreſh your old <hi>Idaeas;</hi> but to adde any thing to your knowledge, and impart to you any new Doctrine, this requires qualities that are not to be found in me. <hi>I</hi> rather hope to be much bettered in knowledge by you; and make account to account you hereafter for one of my Oracles. Prepare your ſelfe therefore to be perſecuted with Queſtions, and look to receive importunities from me in ordinary. Thus I uſe my friends when they are abler men than my ſelfe; and this advantage, which is not great, is accompanied with this incovenience, which is not ſmall. You ſhall beginne to finde it at our next meeting; but in the meane time, I intreat you to believe, that what bad deſigne ſoever I have againſt you, yet I meane, perfectly to be,</p>

                     <p>SIR, I have now theſe three weekes taken mine eaſe, in ſpight of my ſelfe; and one of my feete, which I have not very free, keepes me in my bed, with more inconvenience than paine. Heretofore it hath put me to torture; and therefore I count it now a favour, that it onely keepes me in priſon, which I ſweeten as well as I can, with my Bookes and my friends. You thinke you contribute nothing to the comfort I receive; but I aſſure you, the beſt part of it comes from you; and nothing comforts me ſo much for the faire dayes I loſe, as that excellent <hi>Ode</hi> you ſent me: I am even raviſhed with every part of it; the choice and marſhalling of the words; the ſtructure and harmony of the compoſition; the modeſt greatneſſe of the conceits; the force which ſavours not of any violence: all theſe are worthy to be ranked with the beſt Antiquity. In ſome places you do not onely touch me; but touch me to the quick: the agitation of the Poet, is transferred upon the reader; and no Trumpet makes ſo loude and ſilver a ſound, as your Harpe doth:

                     <p>SIR, By your reckoning you have written to me thrice for nothing, when indeed I knew not of your firſt Letters, but by your laſt: if I had received them, you may be ſure I ſhould have anſwered them, for though I be not very regular in obſerving compliments, yet I am not ſo negligent of neceſſary duties, that I ſhould commit ſo many faults toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, How profound ſoever my ſlumber be, yet I awake preſentlie, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as I am once ſtirred; and eſpecially when it is by ſo deare a name, and by ſo pleaſing a voice as yours is, Never therefore require me to give it in charge to ſome other, to let you heare from me; ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt would be an offence to our friendſhip, an action fitter for a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant than a Cittizen: it were to take me for that great Mogull, who ſpeaks to none but by an Interpreter. <hi>I</hi> like not this ſavage ſtatelineſs, it is far from me to uſe ſo little civility towards men of your worth: when it is <hi>I,</hi> that am beholding to you, <hi>I</hi> pray let it not be my Groome that ſhall thank you for it. <hi>I</hi> will take the paines my ſelfe to aſſure you <hi>I</hi> am wholly yours; and whereas <hi>I</hi> did not bid you farewell at my going from <hi>Park,</hi> you muſt not take it for an argument of ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your perſon, but for an effect of the liberty <hi>I</hi> preſume of, and of the renouncing <hi>I</hi> have vowed to all vaine ceremonies. They that are my friends give me this leave; and you are too well acquainted with the ſolidity of things, to ground your judgement upon apparances; neither do <hi>I</hi> think you will require them of me, who am as bad a courtier, as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>I</hi> am,</p>

Monſieur <hi>de</hi> — is ſtill your perfect friend, and he never writes to me, but he ſpeaks of you. He is at this preſent at <hi>Venice,</hi> where he medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates quietly the agitation of all the world beſides; and where he enjoys the honeſt pleaſures which <hi>Italy</hi> affords to ſpeculative Philoſophers. But Sir, what mean you by ſpeaking of your teares, and of the requeſt you make unto me? Doe you not mock me, when you pray me to comfort you for the death of your Grandfather, who had lived to ſee ſo many Families, ſo many Sects, ſo many Nations, both to be born and die: a man as old as Hereſie it ſelfe: the League was younger than he; which when the Cardinall of <hi>Lorraine</hi> firſt conceived, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Book to be printed, wherein he advertiſed <hi>France</hi> of the concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Monſter. You weep therefore for the loſſes of another age; it is <hi>Anchyſes</hi> or <hi>Laertes</hi> you weepe for; at leaſt it is for a man who did but ſuffer life, and was in a continuall combate with death. He ſhould long agoe have been one of the Church Triumphant, and therefore you ought to have been prepared for either the loſſe, or the gaine that you have made. Monſieur <hi>Rembo</hi> was not of your humour; I ſend you one of his Letters, where you ſhall ſee, he was as much troubled to comfort himſelfe for the life of two Grandmothers that would not die, as hee was for the death of a Brother that died too ſoone. I commend your good Nature, But I like not your Lamentations; which ſhould indeed do him you ſorrow for, great wrong, if they ſhould raiſe him againe to be in the ſtate in which you loſt him. It may ſuffice to tell you, that he is much happier than I; for he ſleepes, and I wake; and he hath no more commerce with men unreaſonable and inhumane, and that are but Wolfes to one another.

                     <p>SIR, if it had not beene for the indiſpoſition of my body, I had not ſtaid ſo many days from thanking you for your many courteſies; but for theſe two moneths I have not ſtirred from my bed; ſo cruelly handled with the Sciatica, that it hath taken from me all the functions of my ſpirit, and made me utterly uncapable of any converſation, otherwiſe you may be ſure I ſhould not voluntarily have deprived my ſelfe of the greateſt contentment I can have, when I have not your company; and that I ſhould not have received three Letters from you, without making you three Anſwers. Now that I have gotten ſome quiet moments from the violence of my torture, and that my paine is turned into lameneſſe, I cannot chuſe but take you by the hand, and tell you, in the firſt place, that you are an ungratefull man, to leave our Muſes, and follow ſome of their ſiſters, that are neither ſo faire, nor ſo worthy of your affection. I intreat you to believe, it is a temptation your evill Angel hath caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you; and that you ought to reject it, as the counſell of an enemy. Things are not now to begin; it is no time now to deliberate; you are gone too farre in the good way to looke back, and to be unwilling to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh that little which remains. To leave eloquence for the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, is to refuſe a Miſtris of eighteen yeares old, and to fall in love with an old woman. God keep you from this unhappineſſe, and inſpire you with better thoughts than thoſe that have carried you to this deſire of change. It would be a diſloyaltie, I ſhould never pardon you, but ſhould blame you for it as long as I live. For making that reckoning of you as I doe, and expecting g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

wrong you ſhould doe, to make me loſe the moſt pleaſing of all my hopes. I therefore, by all meanes, intreat you to perſevere in your firſt deſigne, and to reſolve upon a voyage of three moneths, to come and be reconciled to her whom you have offended, and to make her a publique ſatisfaction by the edition of your writings, by which it will plainely enough be ſeene, the great favours ſhe hath done you. And for my part, I promiſe you a chamber, where you ſhall have the proſpect of a Garden twelve miles long; and ſo you ſhall be at once, both in the City and in the Country.

                     <p>SIR, I doe but now receive your Letter of the twelfth of this Moneth, which confirms me in the opinion I have alwayes had; that my intereſts are as deare unto you as your own, to complement

with you for this, would be to thank you for being good, as much as to ſay for being your ſelf; It is much better to returne you friendſhip for friendſhip, than to pay you with unprofitable words. In a word Sir, I make profeſſion to be an honeſt man, and therefore all the thankfulneſs that can be deſired from a perſon obliged, you may expect from me. As concerning — I aſſure you I wiſh him no ill, becauſe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he hath done me none; it is ſufficient for me, that my friends have no good opinion of his opinions, and that his owne friends begin to take notice of his falſe dealing. In all this there is nothing either new or ſtrange; I am not the firſt innocent that have beene perſecuted in the world, and if I could not beare detraction and ſlander, I ſhould be more dainty than Princes, and their principall officers are, who forbear not to do well, though for their well doing they be evill ſpoken of; the beſt and foundeſt part is of my ſide, I want no protector, either Males or Females, and if I would make uſe of all my advantages, I could oppoſe Doctor to Doctor, and Gown to Gown;

I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech your Lordſhip to conſider me in this laſt quality, and if it be no incivility to make ſuch a requeſt, that you will undertake the buſineſſe I preſent unto you, but as a disburdening you of ſome more weighty, if it be not that my unfortnateneſſe makes the eaſieſt that are to become unpoſſible, I ſee no reaſon you neede to imploy your whole forces about this matter; there needes no more but onely the motion of your will, and a light impreſſion of your credit, with — to give it all the ſolidity and luſtre I deſire. I ſhould not ſeeme to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the tearmes of the laſt Letter he did me the honour to write unto me; if I had not yet ſome little hope left, and a kinde of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in my owne Conſcience.

It is a match for Antiquity in its greateſt pureneſſe and ſeverity. When the <hi>Camilli</hi> and the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s were not in employment, they repoſed themſelves and took their eaſe as you doe; and when I conſider ſometimes the ſweet life you lead at <hi>Diſſay,</hi> I conclude that all the imployments of the Palace, and all the intricacies of the Court are not worth one moment of a wiſe mans idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. It is well knowne that from your childhood you have deſpiſed Vanity, even in her kingdome, and that in an ayre where ſhe had attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives able to draw the oldeſt and moſt reluctant ſpirits. All the pomp of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not ſo much as given you one temptation; and you are ſo confirmed in a generous contempt, that if good Fortune her ſelfe ſhould come to looke you out, you would ſcarce goe out of your Cloſet to meet her in your Chamber. This is that I make ſuch reckoning of in your Lordſhip, and which <hi>I</hi> preferre before all your other qualities; for thoſe, how great ſoever they be, are yet but ſuch as are common with many baſe and mercenary Doctors, whereas this force and courage are things that cannot be acquired in the noyſe and duſt of Schooles. You found not theſe excellent qualities in the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library, nor yet got them by reading of old Manuſcripts; you owe them indeed to Monſieur your deceaſed Farther, that true Knight, without ſpot or wrinkle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> equally skilfull in the art of warre, and in affaires of peace, and that was the <hi>Heros</hi> of <hi>Muret,</hi> of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and of Saint <hi>Mart. I</hi> propoſe not a leſſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for my worſhip than they did, neither indeed is it leſſe, or leſſe ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious than theirs was; and though you did not love me as you doe, and though you ſhould denounce warre againſt me, and become head of a faction to ſeek my ruine, yet <hi>I</hi> ſhould not for all that forbeare to revere ſo rare a vertue as yours is, but ſhould ſtill remaine,</p>

Now that Monſieur <hi>de</hi> — hath quieted the agitation of my mind, and hath aſſur'd me of your love, I cannot forbear to ſignifie unto you the joy I take, telling you withall, that ſo I may preſerve a friend of your merit and worth, I do not greatly care for loving him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is little to be ſeen amongſt men but malice and weakneſs, and even of good men the greateſt part is ſcarce ſound; this is a cauſe why a firm &amp; conſtant ſpirit, as yours is, is of wonderfull uſe in ſociety, &amp; it is no ſmall benefit to them that are weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and overtoyled as I am, to have a perſon to reſt upon, that cannot fall. There is need of courage to maintain a friendſhip &amp; indeed of prudence to performe the meaneſt duty of life; tis nothing worth to have a ſound will, if the underſtanding be defective, it is to no purpoſe that one makes vows and ſacrifices: <hi>Nil vota furent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I know Sir, you have no time to loſe, and to put you to the reading of unprofitable words, what were it but to ſhew an ignorance, how much the King imployes you, and how the preſent affaires goe. It is therefore the reſpect I bear to your continuall imployments, that hath cauſed my ſilence; and I ſhould be very abſurd, if in the aſſiduity of your cares, I ſhould preſent you with little pleaſing amuſements, and ſhould look for an anſwer to ſome poore complement, when you have ſo many commandements of importance, and ſo many orders of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to deliver forth. It is enough for me, that you do me the honour to caſt your eyes upon the proteſtation I make you, that in all the extent of your command, there is not a ſoule more ſubmiſſe, nor more deſirous to beare your yoak, than mine is; and that as much as any in the world, I am,</p>

                     <p>SIR, you need not wonder to ſee your name in the Book I ſend you: Lovers, you know, leave marks of their paſſion every where, and if they were able, would fill the whole earth with their cyphers and devices. It is a cuſtome as ancient as the world, for with that began writing alſo: and at firſt, for want of paper, men graved the names of thoſe they lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, upon the barks of trees.

here as many Rivals as you have Auditors. Yet there is not the ſame object of all our affections: they run after your words, and hang at your mouth: but I go farther, and diſcover in your heart, that which is better than your eloquence. I could eaſily reſiſt your Figures and your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but your goodneſs and your freeneſs take me captive preſently: I therefore give you the title of a perfect friend in your <hi>Encomium:</hi> becauſe I account this a more worthy quality, than to be a perfect Oratour, and becauſe I make moſt reckoning of that vertue in a man, which humane ſociety hath moſt need of. For other matters, remember your ſelf, in what terms I did ſpeak to you of the buſineſs you write of; and that onely to obey you, <hi>I</hi> have been contented to alter my opinion. <hi>I</hi> was well aſſured the enterpriſe would never take effect; but <hi>I</hi> thought it better to faile by conſenting than by obſtinacy, and rather to take a repulſe, than not to take your counſell.

But though it were ſo, that you had no tie upon me, and that without ungratefulneſs, I might forbeare to love you; yet I intreat you to believe, that the knowledge I have of your worth &amp; merit, would never give me leave to doe it, but that the naturall reſpect we owe to things that are perfect, would alwayes bind me infinitely to honour you, and to be with all my ſoul, as I am,</p>

Suffer me to call them ſo, that ſolicite your Colledge againſt me, and make it leſſe favourable to me, than I ad good right to hope for. It is not their zeale of your Religion, nor intereſt of the publique that ſets them on work; it is an old ſpight they beare me, which I could never maſter

with all my long patience. It is the hate of a dead man which lives ſtill in his Tomb, it is his reliques that warre upon me, and whereof ſome ill diſpoſed French do ſerve themſelves to diſgrace a work, which hath no other end but the honour and ſervice of the King. I never doubted of your good nature, and I know, if need were, your charity would cover the multitude of my faults; but in this caſe, I think I have reaſon rather to ask juſtice at your hands, and tell you, that if you take the paines to conſider my words as <hi>I</hi> meant them, and not have my enemies correct them; you will eaſily grant they contain nothing contrary to the orthodox Doctrine, or that is not maintainable in all the Schools of Chriſtendom. This being ſo, my dear Couſin, I doubt not but you will ſtrongly defend my cauſe, at leaſt my perſon, and will be pleaſed to aſſure the Gentlemen of your fraternity, that having always accounted their Colledge as the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of true Doctrine, and as the interpreter of the Church in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; I could not wiſh a more ſweet or glorious fruit of my travails, than to ſee them entertained by ſo learned &amp; holy Perſonages, that my greateſt ambition is but to merit their good acceptance, &amp; to deſerve their favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable cenſure; and if for obtaining this I have not either happineſſe enough, or not enough ſufficiency, I have at leaſt docibleneſſe enough to learne of them that which I know not, and to confeſſe that in their learned conferences they poſſeſſe the ſecret and certainty of all holy points, whereof we in our private meditatoins have but ſuſpitions and conjectures, that if I were aſſaulted by ſtrangers, I could perhaps make a ſhift to reſiſt, and that with ſucceſſe, but that I prefer obedience, which I owe before a victory, which I might get; that I deſire not to conteſt with my fathers, nor pretend to have reaſon againſt their authority, to which I ſubmit my ſelf in ſuch ſort, that I am reſolved to aſſure my ſelf of nothing, but upon their word and credit, and from henceforth to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no truth, but that which they ſhall pleaſe to teach me: I leave it to you to augment, to reforme, or embelliſh this complement, as you ſhall think fit; I make you Maſter of the whole buſineſſe, and never meane to diſavow any thing you ſhall doe, being abſolutely,</p>

Yet I intend not hereby to ask it of you with importunity, and to engage you againe in a commerce of unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable words, which would but wrong your neceſſary imployments: I am well enough ſatisfied with the aſſurance I have of your love, and am well contented you ſhould keep your complements for thoſe you love not ſo well, when I ſhall finde my ſelfe to ſtand in need of you; <hi>I</hi> am not grown ſo baſhfull, but that I can uſe the liberty I have long uſed, and trouble you againe by my freeneſſe. Hitherto it hath afforded you nothing but trouble, and it was your evil Angel that inſpired you with a deſire at firſt to be acquainted with me. But one day, perhaps, I ſhall be more happy; and for ſo many and great favours you have done me, it may be you may draw from me ſome ſmall argument of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement. In the mean time Sir, I deſire you not to caſt upon me, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation which I am not able to maintaine; make no more mocks at my <hi>pratling,</hi> and hide the ſhame of your friend, which your other friend hath publiſhed. He onely is guilty of the fault that was done; and you may well think, I was not ſo impudent to ſend falſe Latin to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> as much as to deliver falſe Money to the Mint, and think to make Mint-men take it for currant. It ſhall ſuffice me, that you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the French, I mean to bring you; or at leaſt, that you make it worthy of your approving, by making it new with your corrections.

By this you may know, that <hi>I</hi> count nothing difficult, which reflects upon any intereſt of yours, or which cencernes your contentment; and <hi>I</hi> love you ſo much, that <hi>I</hi> ſhould not ſay ſo much, if I had more craft in me than <hi>I</hi> have But my good Nature exceeds all other conſiderations of vulgar Prudence; and <hi>I</hi> would not keep you from knowing what great power you have over me, though <hi>I</hi> knew before-hand you would abuſe this power. For other things, <hi>I</hi> am very glad to heare you begin to grow ſenſible of the charms of muſique, and that you go to the Conſorts, which are in reputation. Yet <hi>I</hi> have ſeen the time, when your eares were no learneder than mine,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:120345:209"/>
and when you made no great difference between the ſound of Lutes, and the noyſe of Bells. See what it is to frequent good company; and to live in a Country of neatneſſe. <hi>I</hi> that ſtirre not from the Village, know no other muſique, but that of Birds; and if ſometimes <hi>I</hi> heare a more ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſound, it comes from thoſe noble Animalls which Monſier <hi>Heinſius</hi> praiſeth ſo much: and which by <hi>Lucians</hi> ſaying, ſerve for Trumpets in the Kingdome of the Moone. <hi>I</hi> give you a thouſand thanks for your newes, but eſpecially for the laſt; it is certaine, that the choice of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Belieure</hi> to the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Italy,</hi> is a thing will be general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well liked; men talk wonders already of his beginnings, of the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Vivacity of his Spirit, of the force and ſtayedneſſe of his Judgement, beſides ſome other excellent qualities of his Age, from which we may hope for much.

I hope we ſhall meete together ere long; and then we ſhall not neede to feare his being too ſtrong for us in our conferences, when we two ſhall be againſt him alone.

Not that I was afraid, I ſhould loſe it, but becauſe it is a pleaſure, to heare ones ſelfe called happy; and that one cannot have too many titles for a poſſeſſion, which can never be too much valued. I take not upon me to contend with you in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, or to diſpute of civility with you, who live in the light of the world, and have whole <hi>Magaſins</hi> of good words.

Pardon therefore a rudeneſſe which I cannot avoid, and ſeeing I am not able to anſwer you, give me leave to aſſaile you, and require you to give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the preſent ſtate of things: What can you ſay Sir, of theſe wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <hi>Flemmins,</hi> who ſhut their gates againſt good Fortune when ſhe

                     <p>SIR, my complements are very rare, and I take no great care for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving your friendſhip. I account you ſo true of your word, that I cannot doubt of having your love, ſeeing you have done me the honour to let me have your promiſe. It is to no purpoſe to ſolicite Judges that cannot be corrupted; it is enough for procuring their favour, that the cauſe be good. You ſee therefore, I doe not much trouble my ſelfe to commend mine unto you, and I preſent my ſelfe ſo ſeldome before you, that if you had not an excellent memory, you had certainly forgot me long ago. I pray you not to do me good offices, for knowing that you let ſlip no occaſion of doing good: I may be ſure to have my part of your good deeds, though you have none of my prayers. Your new Acqueſts at the Court, make you not leave that you have on this ſide the <hi>Loyre:</hi> your friends that are alwayes with you, take not up all your heart, there is ſome place left for your friends farther off, of which number I am one, and more in love, Sir, with the contemplative life, than ever. I am alwayes under ground, and buried with my trees, and they muſt be very ſtrong cords, and very violent commandements, that ſhould remove me: yet I am contented to give my thoughts a liberty: and my ſpirit is often in the place where you are, and my abſence is not ſo idly beſtowed, but that I can make you a reckoning of it. I ſpeak to you in this manner, becauſe I know you are no hater of delightfull knowledges, and have an excellent taſte to judge of things. Though by profeſſion you be a Souldier, yet I refuſe you not for a Judge in our peacable difference, being well aſſured,

and generous, and one that will alwayes religiouſly pay whatſoéver you owe, either to bloud or friendſhip, yet this hinders me not from being obliged to you, and to your good Birth for it. This hath beſtowed a friend upon me, which I never took pains, either to look out, or to make: it is a preſent of Nature, which I ſhould have taken, if ſhe had given me my choyce. I deſire you to believe, that I never ſtood leſſe in neede of comfort, than now; I oppoſe nothing againſt the rage of a thouſand ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, but my ſcorn: I am Armor of proof againſt all the tales from the Suburbs St. <hi>Honoré,</hi> and from all the Libells of the ſtreet St. <hi>Iaques.</hi> They increaſe daily in ſight, and if the heat of their ſpirits do not abate, there will ſhortly be a little Library of follies written againſt me. But you never yet heard of ſuch a gravity as I have, nor of a mind that could take ſuch reſt in the midſt of ſtorms and tempeſts as I do; and this I owe to Philoſophy, under whoſe covert I ſhelter my ſelf: it is not only higher than mountains, where we ſee it rain and hail below us: but it is ſtronger alſo than a Fortreſs, where we may ſtand out of danger, &amp; make mouths at our enemies. All that hurts me in the warre of —, is that which concernes the intereſt of others: it grieves me extreamly, that his cruelty ſhould leave me, and fall upon my friends. I wiſh I could have bought out the three lives, that touch the honour of — with a third Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of injuries done to my ſelfe, and where no body elſe ſhould have any part: and I may truly ſay, that this is the onely blow, which that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious enemy hath given me, that goes to my heart; and the onely of all his offences that I have felt. I intreat you to let my friend know of my grief, and to make ſure unto me this rare perſonage by all the cares and good offices your courteſie can deviſe. His vertue ought to be inviolable to detraction, but detraction will not ſpare vertue it ſelfe, but takes a delight in violating the beſt things. I have reaſon to place him in this rank, and conſidering him as one of the moſt accompliſht works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I muſt needes conſider withall, that Nature it ſelfe is ſometimes calumniated. Madam 
<hi>de</hi> — enquires often after you, and hath a great opinion of your heart and ſpirit. You may be ſure I ſay nothing in oppoſition to the account ſhe holds you in, but am rather glad to ſee my judgement confirmed by ſo infallible an authority: ſee, you be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes good, and alwayes lay hold upon our antient Maximes, and be aſſured I am, and alwayes will be,</p>

                     <p>SIR, you are a man of your word, and ſomething more. You promiſe leſſe than you performe, having undertaken to furniſh me but with Gazets; you extend your largeſſe to large volumnes of Books. This <hi>Jonnius,</hi> whoſe Verſes you ſent me, is no ordinary man.

For example, upon the Canonization of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> made by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the fifteenth,

I ſhould think, that this deſcanting makes not much for the honour of Princes chief Counſellors; and it ſeems, the Poet in this place, forgot M. the Cardinall, who guides the publique fortune, and governs the world under this name of Miniſter. There is no greater reckoning to be made, no great matter to be built upon three or four little ſyllables, which ſignifie nothing, but what cuſtome, without any reaſon pleaſeth, and are of no more value than uſe gives them.

I doubt not but you will give your beſt advice to the Gentleman that is recommended to you, and will ſet forward the beſt you can the deſign we have to make him one day an honeſt man. <hi>I</hi> find the Booke more neatly, and more correctly printed than I could have imagined; and I would tell you that you are an able Grammarian, but that <hi>I</hi> feare your Divinity would be angry for giving you ſo ſmall a praiſe, and ſo much vilified by the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieurs</hi> or Maſters. The two Latin Tracts you ſent me are as different of ſtile as they are of matter.

Author talk of himſelf; he thinks his Pen as much worth as the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s Sword, and no leſs fatall to States and Princes. He ſaith it is he that beſtowes glory or diſhonour, makes men famous or infamous as he pleaſeth, and that he hath means enough to be revenged of the Emperour or Pope, if the Emperour or the Pope ſhould offer him any wrong. <hi>Scaliger, Lipſius</hi> and <hi>Caſaubon</hi> were by his owne ſaying, but his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners, and all the light of the former age, but the <hi>Aurora</hi> of his, and yet for all this, he hath but a very little head, and but very ſtaring eys, and but a very fumbling ſpeech, and but a very ſilly diſcourſe, that you may know his judgement is not the praedominant part of his ſoule. But the world talks otherwiſe of him, that he is a loſt man, and one that hath forfeited his brains, not onely ſwallowed up of a ſtrong and vaſt imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, not onely bending under the burden of an overcharged memory, but apt to loſe himſelfe in the walks of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Philoſophy, for which yet he is become an Apoſtate from <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Doctrine. I confeſs unto you now, that the time hath been <hi>I</hi> have made much reckoning of this man, &amp; am ſtill of thoſe ill huſbands that give preſents, but pay no debts It is certain, I diſcharge my duty extreamly ill; &amp; Monſ. <hi>Videll</hi> hath juſt cauſe to think me the moſt uncivil man that lives. But you know the ſecret of this matter, and that in my incivility there is a kind of Religion, which I have not dared as yet to violate. Unleſs I ſhould ſin againſt my faith gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, I can neither enjoy the good he hath done me, nor give him the thanks I owe him; and this is the extremity of my miſery, that I have receiv'd a moſt precious gift, and yet can neither be rich by it, nor thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for it. Take ſome courſe for Gods ſake, that <hi>I</hi> may diſpenſe with an each that is ſo contrary to honeſty, and ſo directly croſſeth the right of nations and all good manners. Intreat our friend to give me my liberty again, which I have ſolemnly promiſed to imploy wholly in doing him ſervice, and in accommodating that confuſion which makes me commit this diſorder. Monſieur <hi>de Plaſſae</hi> hath ſo powerfully confuted that which I writ the other day to Madam <hi>D' Anguitour,</hi> that I am become perſwaded my ſelf, and am no longer of my own opinion, but willingly confeſs, that if I ſhould be obſtinate in defending my falſe maxims, I ſhould do as ill as make a ſchiſm amongſt Ladies, &amp; be the Author of a moſt pernitious doctrine.

                     <p>SIR, my moſt dear Father, you have obliged me exceedingly unto you, for imparting unto me the good newes that is come, and for communicating with me, the joy you take in the happy ſucceſſe of the Kings Army. I do not think he hath a better ſubject in all his Kingdom, than your ſelfe; never ſervant was more zealous for his Maſters great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; never <hi>Perſian</hi> more religiouſly adored Monarchy. You love your children, I know, infinitely, yet this is but your ſecond love; that of the State, and of the Publique, goes farre before it, and I feare me, you would give us all for the pooreſt Frontier Town of <hi>Flanders,</hi> or for any paltry Fort of <hi>Millan</hi> That which I read in the Poſt ſcript of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, did ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> very well pleaſe me; the good opinion which Monſieur <hi>de</hi> — ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>h of me, is more a burthen to me, than an honour: and I could wiſh, he would make leſs reckoning of me, ſo he would let me be more at quiet. You have a ſtrange friend of him, to take me for his common place book, and to think that I am an Index for finding out conceits and figures. In the matter you propounded to me on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, I can ſay no more than what I have ſaid already; but if he pleaſe to take the paines to Tranſlate my French into Latin, he may eaſily do in ſuch ſort, that he ſhall be taken for the Author, and I but for the Tranſlator<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have told you of the dignity of the Language, in which he meanes to write, and what great advantage it hath over ours; it is certain, that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>levates and raiſeth up the low thoughts of the Authors, and gives much more to them, than it receives from them. Whereas ours contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, hath no beauty, but as the Authors embelliſh it and ſet it out. It hath
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:120345:215"/>
no ſubſiſtence, but by the matter, no force, but from the ſubjects that are handled. <hi>I</hi> have made choice, of ſome, which I thought fitteſt for his purpoſe, if he finde them for his turn, he may make uſe of them, and better them much by putting them into <hi>Cicero</hi>'s ſtile and phraſe: and theſe are they. Good men ought to deſire great Dignities, as a neceſſary means to perform great atchievements, which if they perform them not, both God will call them to account for his graces, no better imployed, and the World will juſtly complain; it is left a prey to the wicked, and that the deſire of their own private quiet, makes them abandon all care of the publick. This is to tell you, my Lord, that you ought to reſerve your humility, for actions that paſs between God and you; but that for other matters you cannot have too much credit, nor too much greatneſs, ſeeing it is fit that wiſdom ſhould be obeyed, and that there are ſome vertues, which cannot be acted by thoſe that are poore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though we be not ſo out of the world, but that we hear newes of it; yet it paſſeth through ſo many places, that it cannot chuſe but receive divers impreſſions, and can never come to us in purity, ſeeing it gathers mudde in coming but from the <hi>Louure.</hi> Yet I have come to know, and fame hath ſounded in our deſart, the great battels that have been fought for the honour of <hi>France,</hi> and how you have vanquiſhed the ſpirits of ſtrangers, which is a greater victory than to vanquiſh their forces. I have come to know, that <hi>Italy</hi> hath vented out all her ſubtilties, and imployed them to deceive us, and yet could not; and that theſe ſpirits, which thought to reigne in all aſſemblies, and to be maſters of reaſon, have not beene able to defend themſelves againſt you, but with ſpight and choller, nor to complain of any thing, but that you perſwaded them to that, which they came reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved never to do, ſo as they which called us Barbarians, and got alwayes as much by their Treaties, as they loſt by our Victories, have found at laſt, that there is wiſdome on this ſide the <hi>Alpes,</hi> as well as beyond, and are driven to acknowledge, that we had a man amongſt us now, able to hinder them from deceiving us as they had done. They wondred to ſee a Servant that could not endure there ſhould be a greater Maſter than his own, that felt the leaſt evils of his Country, as if they were his proper wounds, and thought it a hurt to himſelf, if there were but an offer made to touch the Dignity of his Crowne; but when they ſaw that you applyed remedies upon the ſodaine to all inconveniencies, which they thought you could never have avoyded, that you not only anſwer'd all objections they made, but prevented all they intended to make, that you dived into their ſoules, and took hold of their intentions there, and at the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, made anſwer to that which they reſerved for the ſecond; then in truth their fleam turned into choller, and then you quite routed all their humane Prudence, and all their politick Maximes, &amp;c. I am not able to diſſemble the joy I take, to heare that your good ſervices are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:120345:215"/>
that when divers counſels had been tryed, yet yours, at laſt, was ſtill faine to be followed, and that in guiding the fortune of <hi>France,</hi> you are no leſſe Preſident of all affaires of <hi>Europe.</hi> It is true, that of all externall contentments, <hi>I</hi> have none ſo ſenſible to me as this; but on the other ſide, when I heare that your health is continually aſſaulted, or at leaſt threatned by ſome accident or other, that the reſt, which the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your Conſcience ought to afford you, keeps you not from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unquiet Nights, and that in the midſt of all your glory and good ſucceſſes, yet you oftentimes are as it were, weary of your life, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, &amp;c. And can it not be, that you ſhould come to heare the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique acclamations, but in the unquietneſſe of your watchings? Nor of your praiſes, but in your paines? Muſt the Senſe ſuffer, and the Spirit rejoyce? Muſt you be upon the rack, when you are in your triumphs? Muſt you do two contrary works at once, and at the ſame time have need both of moderation and of patience? If vertue could be miſerable, and that the ſect, which accounts nothing evill but paine, nothing good but pleaſure, were not univerſally condemned. Certainely the divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, would at this day be complained upon by places of all this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and all honeſt men, would in your behalfe finde ſomething amiſs in the worlds government.

                        </gap>t my Lord, you know better than I, that it is the happineſſe of Beaſts onely, of which we muſt believe the body; for, as for ours, which reſides in our higheſt part, it is as little ſenſible of diſorders that are below her, as they which are in Heaven are uncapable of offences by ſtormes of the aire, or by vapours of the earth. And this being ſo, God forbid that I ſhould judge of your condition by the ſtate of your health, and not think him perfectly happy whom I eſteem. Doe but imagine with your ſelfe, that you have made a diviſion of the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of humane nature, with other men, and then you ſhall finde the advantage is on your ſide, ſeeing there is in you but a ſmal portion of pain for infinite defects that are in others. Yet I cannot but think, that the term of your patience is neere expired, and that the time to come is preparing contentments for you that are wholly pure, and will make you young againe after the time, as before the time you have made your ſelf old. The King that hath need of your long life, makes no wiſhes in vaine, and heaven heares not the prayers of the enemies of our ſtate. We know of no ſucceſſour fit to undertake what you leave unfiniſhed; and if it be true that our Armies are but the armes of your head, and that God hath choſen your counſaile for eſtabliſhing the affairs of this age; why ſhould we feare a loſſe which hath no right to come but to our poſterity? he will not in this onely point leave imperfect the happineſſe he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed us; be loves men too well to deprive them of that good which you are borne to do them. When Armies are defeated, there may new be levied, and a ſecond Fleet may be ſet forth when the firſt is loſt;

                     <head>To Monſieur <hi>de Boiſrobert.</hi> LETTER LI.</head>
                     <p>SIR, the Muſes never favoured man as they do you; you are the onely man that need neither retreite nor leiſure for your meditations; In the troubles of the world you poſſeſſe your ſpirit in peace, and ſeeing the bruit of the Court diverts not your attention, neither can the Sea and all its waves hinder your compoſitions. It is no ſmall advantage to finde that ſolitude in ones ſelfe, which others ſeeke for in the Deſart, and not to be bound to goe out of the world for fetching in of ſound opinions and perſwaſive words. If the merit of yours take place, we ſhall ſhortly ſee at Stage-playes, as many long Caſſocks, as ſhort Robes, and the moſt auſtere Philoſophers will have their hands and eyes in the recreations of the people, and ſo Sir, of a miſchiefe you ſhall make a remedy; you ſhall ſet timerous ſpirits at liberty, and ſhall free us from two terrible Monſters, ſcrupulouſneſſe, and vitious baſhfulneſſe. You make me long to bear a part in this action, and in this ſort to defend the Theater; to take the field after you is not ſo much to fight as to purſue the victory, and I think it no wrong to vertue to juſtifie an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent pleaſure, and that which is onely worthy of her; this we owe to <hi>Jaſon,</hi> to <hi>Maſiniſſa,</hi> to <hi>Brutus,</hi> and other worthy men, who live at this day in the perſon of the man you ſo much commend, and whom <hi>I</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire as often as I heare. It is certaine, that the grace with which he pronounceth vertue, gives them a degree of goodneſſe, which the Poets could not. They are more beholding to him that pronounceth them, than to him that made them; and this ſecond Father (if I may ſo ſpeak) purgeth by his adoption all the vices of their birth; the tune of his voice accompanied with the dignity of his geſtures, gives a kinde of noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the vulgar and baſe conceits. No ſoule is ſo ſtrongly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified againſt the objects of ſenſe, which he forceth not; No judgement ſo wary and ſo well prepared, which is not caught with the impoſture of his words, in ſuch ſort, that if in this world there be any happineſſe for verſes, it is certainly in his mouth, and in his pronouncing; by which, as evill things get the colour of good, ſo good things get the uttermoſt of their perfection. Let me know Sir, wether I hit right upon your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; and in the mean time I give you many thanks for your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny favours, particularly for the Letter of my Lord you took the pains to ſend me. He writes indeed in the ſtyle of a Conquerour, and theſe words <hi>Accepi, legi, probavi,</hi> ſavour much of theſe, <hi>Veni, vidi, vici</hi> of <hi>J: Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> and of theſe, <gap reason="foreign">

was afterwards. Though I ſhould never receive other mark of his love but this, yet were this a full recompence of all the paſſion I ow to his ſervice; yet I muſt tell you, I cannot forget the honour he hath done me, in procuring me a promiſe that I ſhall be paid of — I have done all poſſible I could to blot this thought out of my minde, but I confeſſe unto you, that my imaginative part is a little ſtrong. I could never hitherto ſatisfie my ſelfe herein, and what bad anſwer ſoever I receive from men, yet ſtill I rely upon this word of God, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me to hope well, and therefore I wait ſtill for the accompliſhment of the Oracle. All our people are extreamly bound unto you for remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring it, and I am my ſelfe more than all the world together,</p>

                  <p>THe name of <hi>Balzack</hi> is not confined within the <hi>Orbe</hi> of one Kingdom: his pen hath made him known unto all that pretend to <hi>Eloquence</hi> and <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Learning: And had his language been more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, his worth had been more known. It is then a duty we owe to virtue to unfold it, when it is contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within too narrow limits, and to unlock the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, and make it communicable, when it is reſtrained from that freedom which is part of its eſſence and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Wherefore ſome of our own, finding that our <hi>Authors</hi> Language was too narrow for the merits of his works, have rendered ſome pieces of his in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi> Nor did their Travails fall ſhort of their hopes, but ſucceſs hath crowned their endeavors. By the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of their auſpicious flight abroad, I made <hi>Augury</hi> touching the fortunes of this freſh piece, whtch I now expoſe to the common light, without the countenance and patronage of any great name, but guarded onely with its own fate: It hath a Genius, and carries the name of <hi>Balzac</hi> in every page, that is enough.</p>

                  <head>A Letter of Monſieur de <hi>Balzac</hi> to the Reverend Father <hi>Garaſſius</hi> of the Society of Jeſus.</head>

                     <salute>Father,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOu have lighted on that ſide, upon which I confeſs my weakeſt ſtrength doth lie, and your courteſies have left nothing for your valor to perform that might force me to yield. Since you imploy all your <hi>Muſes</hi> to beg my friendſhip, and that you have already requited it with your own, I can no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it then as another mans goods. But if this were not ſo, my injuries are not ſo dear unto me, but that I do uſually forgive them upon leſſe reaſon then they were given, and my paſſions do never grow ſo head-ſtrong but they remain ſtill in the power of Religion and Philoſophy. Hitherto I was able to maintain a good cauſe, but ſhould I be obſtinate and oppoſe that alſo that you deſire, I ſhould do wrong to right it ſelf if it were on my ſide, and from ſimple enmity which hath been tolerated in ſome <hi>Republicks,</hi> I ſhould proceed to tyranny which is odious to all the world. Since we our ſelves are mortal, there is no reaſon our paſſions ſhould be immortal, and that men ſhould glut themſelves with revenge, whereof God hath prohibited as well the uſe as the exceſſe. This is a thing that he reſerves wholly for himſelf, and becauſe he alone knowes how to uſe this part of juſtice, he would not commit it to the hands of mortalls, no more then he would thunder and tempeſts. Let us therefore ſtop at our firſt quarrelling, for it is already too much to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. Let us not give the name of courage to hardneſs of heart, and if you have prevented me in the overture of peace, which we negotiate, let it not repent you that you have robbed me thereby of all the honor that was here to be acquired. At other times magnanimity and humility might be two contrary things; but ſince moral principles have been changed into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical</hi> Maxims, and that the vices of <hi>Pagans</hi> are become
<pb facs="tcp:120345:224"/>
the vertues of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> there is a ſort of cowardiſe that a man of valour ought to ſhew: and true glory doth not belong to them that have triumphed over <hi>Innocents,</hi> but to the Martyrs that they have made, and to thoſe men that they have oppreſſed. But if we muſt deſcend from general conſiderations to that which is between you and me in particular; as there could be no colour that a religious man would diſturb the tranquillity of his thoughts, and quit his converſation with God and Angels, for to intermeddle with ſinful Creatures, and partake in our diſorders: ſo there were leſſe reaſon yet, that I ſhould go and ſeek for an enemy out of the world, whereas they are within it ſo many <hi>Huguenots</hi> to exerciſe my hate upon, and ſo many Rebels to combate with. Moreover Father, what opinion ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you had of it, notwithſtanding any thing that I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the beginning of my letter, yet it was never my purpoſe to wage warre with you in good earneſt, I was not ſo far moved as I made ſhew of, and all my anger was but <hi>artificial,</hi> when my words did at any time ſeem injurious; ſo that I do willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſent that what was written to <hi>Hydaſpes,</hi> ſhall paſſe for an exerciſe of wit, not for an argument of my belief, and that men ſhould believe that I intended onely to ſhew that my ſtrength could vaniſh truth, when I did not fight for her. That <hi>Science</hi> that durſt undertake to perſwade ſick men that a <hi>quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane Ague</hi> is better then health; <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> I ſay, that could frame a <hi>Panegyrick</hi> for <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſiris,</hi> an <hi>Apologie</hi> for <hi>Nero,</hi> and put all <hi>Rome</hi> into a doubt, whether juſtice were better omitted then executed, might well yet at this day be practiſed upon ſubjects that ſwerve from common <hi>Tenents,</hi> and by pleaſing <hi>fictions</hi> raiſe mens wonder, though not win belief: This makes <hi>phantaſmes,</hi> onely to unmake them again, it hath <hi>varniſhes</hi> &amp; diſguiſes to alter the purity of any thing in the world, it can ſhift ſides without imputation of fickleneſs, and accuſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence without guilt of calumnie. And certainly <hi>Painters</hi> and <hi>Stage-players</hi> are not guilty of thoſe murthers that we behold in their <hi>Tables</hi> and on their <hi>Theaters,</hi> but here, he that is moſt cruel is reputed moſt juſt. Thoſe that make Glaſſes which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb facs="tcp:120345:224"/>
one object for another are not accuſed of <hi>Impoſture,</hi> and <hi>Error</hi> is ſometimes comelier then the truth. In a word, the life of the greateſt <hi>Sages</hi> is not evermore ſerious; all their talke is not preaching, and whatſoever they write is not their laſt Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, or a confeſſion of their faith. What ſhall I ſay more? Think you that I am ſo delicate as to condemn all the taſts of the numerous multitude which throng to hear you every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Do you imagine that the people and I can never concur in the ſame opinion, and that I mean to oppoſe the general ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of good men, the approbation of <hi>Doctors,</hi> and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Superiors?</hi> No good <hi>Father,</hi> I do not allow that ſwinge and liberty to my underſtanding: aſſure your ſelf, that I eſteem you in that degree as I ought, I applaud your <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and were it truer now then ever that to compoſe great <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes</hi> is to commit great ſins, yet notwithſtanding, if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me to judge of yours, according to the portion which you did ſend me, I ſpeak boldly, that it is moſt excellent in its kind, and <hi>Monſ: Malherbe</hi> and I will not deny you a place in the <hi>Claſſe</hi> of <hi>Fathers</hi> of the latter age. But our teſtimonies and <hi>Encomiums</hi> will not be the onely fruit of your labors. I deſire with all my heart, that the converſion of <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> may be the approbation of it, and I think that all the glory of this world ſhould be accounted but <hi>ayre</hi> and <hi>emptineſs,</hi> by them that aim at nothing but the advancement of Gods glory. Wherefore I need not enlarge my ſelf any farther upon this ſubject, nor wrong ſacred things by prophane commendations, my intention is onely to teſtifie to you, that I claim not ſo ſmall a part in the intereſts of the Church, as not to be moſt hartily thankful to thoſe that do her ſervice, and that I am right glad, that beſides the reaſons that prompt me to eſteem your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, one ſo powerful as that of <hi>Religion</hi> doth yet farther oblige me thereunto.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat <hi>Scorn</hi> and contempt that you were pleaſed lately to throw upon a <hi>Libel,</hi> fram'd againſt <hi>Monſ. de Balzac,</hi> and your denial then to licenſe it for the <hi>Preſſe,</hi> are a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient teſtimonie how much you do value the perſon of that man. You did conceive, that being, as you are, the ſupreme <hi>Diſpenſer</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> you had (in a ſort) violated that <hi>Juſtice,</hi> in permitting ſuch hard <hi>cenſures</hi> to paſſe upon that man, whom you with ſo much reaſon approved, and whom o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cannot with any reaſon reprehend. So that if there be any yet to be found, that cannot fully perſwade themſelves to approve of this man by your <hi>example,</hi> their obſtinacy is ſufficiently confuted by your <hi>Authority.</hi> And if <hi>this</hi> cannot repreſſe their <hi>ſiniſter</hi> intents, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, it prevents the effects of them, and hinders that he be not <hi>perſecuted</hi> in print. This high favour which flowes from that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, which you did alwaies bear to his <hi>writings,</hi> did invite me to collect with all diligence, theſe rare <hi>productions</hi> of his ſpirit, for the contentation of yours. And as it was not without his conſent, that one of his friends hath depoſited this <hi>treaſure</hi> in my hands: ſo I do verily believe, that this office of preſenting them to you, is alſo very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable

to his <hi>inclinations.</hi> Your <hi>worth</hi> is ſo evidently known, that none ſhould imagine I could chooſe a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> more noble or more <hi>propitieus;</hi> and the general <hi>current</hi> of mens affections to doe you ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is ſo <hi>ſtrong</hi> and high, that I could not ſhun this <hi>Duty.</hi> As for me, I confeſſe I am exceedingly pleaſed with this occaſion that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelf to me, for to make it appear to your <hi>Honour,</hi> how ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive I am of the late favours which your <hi>Bounty</hi> hath conferred upon me. Certainly, <hi>my Lord,</hi> my obligations unto you muſt bee infinitely great, ſince when I have preſented you with all that the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence</hi> of this age hath moſt precious, yet notwithſtanding I muſt remain your debtor, while I draw breath. You ſhall meet here with <hi>Doctrines,</hi> which the auſtereſt <hi>Philoſophy</hi> would not diſdain to own and profeſſe; Among theſe <hi>ſevere</hi> ſpeculations, you ſhall ſee ſome flaſhes of wit break forth, which will ſerve to entertain you with much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; I ſpeak of the <hi>French Epiſtles,</hi> for as for his <hi>Latine,</hi> I referre them to the judgement of thoſe that doe better underſtand the <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>delicacy</hi> of that language.

So that <hi>(my Lord)</hi> the univerſal conſent of all the world, ſtrengthned by a preſcription of 18. centuries of years, is not a ſufficient title for to warrant the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of that <hi>Roman,</hi> againſt the prevaricating quirks of this <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian.</hi> Indeed, this is a buſineſſe of no good example, but yet ſince it is ſo, and that it doth little avail <hi>Virtue,</hi> to be conſecrated by time, and to be crowned by the people, for to make it inviolable againſt the practiſes of ſome private Humors. There is no reaſon that I ſhould complain before ſo many <hi>Worthies,</hi> that have been ſo ill intreated themſelves, and that I ſhould be had in any conſideration, where <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> are not in ſafetie; an ordinary man ſhould not make moan, for ſuffering the ſame deſtiny, which extraordinary Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have undergone; and I cannot with modeſtie, deſire or expect from you that you ſhould reform the world for the love of me; nay, I know <hi>(my Lord)</hi> that this little diſorder, is of ſome good uſe in a Common-wealth; and it were to be wiſhed, that malice would buſie it ſelf thus, about things of ſmall importance, that it might not think of buſineſſe of higher conſequence. Thoſe that have hitherto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed their pains, in depraving the ſenſe of my words, and in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifying my works, had (perhaps) ere this time, forged mens <hi>Teſtaments,</hi> and minted falſe coins; And he that now deſires from you a priviledge, would have ſtood in need of a pardon, it may be, if it had not been for me. It is better by far, that injuſtice ſhould exerciſe it ſelf upon my books, then that it ſhould vex and <hi>implead</hi> againſt all
<pb facs="tcp:120345:227"/>
that is good and ſacred in a civil ſocietie; that unjuſt men ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther toſſe and tranſpoſe words, invert and pervert periods of ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, then remove the bounds of lands, or demoliſh their <hi>Neighbours</hi> houſes; To ſay the truth, this is the moſt innocent way that <hi>vice</hi> can employ it ſelf in, and I believe I have not a little deſerved from the Commonwealth, for keeping at work theſe ten years, ſuch an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of idle companions, who (certainly) would have been dangerous Common-wealths men, if they had not choſen rather to have been ridiculous <hi>Cenſors.</hi> It is well, that the heat of their brains, is <hi>exhaled</hi> out this way, and that their intemperance takes this courſe, and that to prevent their fury, men give ſome ſcope and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to their folly. Permit them therefore this exerciſe <hi>(my Lord)</hi> they cannot chooſe but make uſe of their time, which they will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy farre worſe, if you doe not permit them to imploy it thus-Permit <hi>giddy</hi> Youth to ſpend their heat and fury upon a ſenſeleſſe ſubject, and a dead Letter, which is not capable either of joy or ſorrow. As long as theſe <hi>Pen-fincers</hi> onely begge the <hi>Seal</hi> of your <hi>Authority,</hi> be no niggard of the <hi>Prince</hi> his grace and favour, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ſomething of your wonted ſeverity and rigour. If it were a new and unuſual thing, it may be, I ſhould be contented to have the firſt <hi>Libel,</hi> which branded me with injuries be ſuppreſſed, but ſince there is now a pretty <hi>Librarie</hi> of them, I am in a manner well pleaſed it ſhould ſwell and encreaſe; and I take a delight to build me a <hi>monument</hi> with thoſe ſtones, which <hi>envy</hi> hath hurl'd at me, without doing me harm. I account it no diſgrace to be cenſured by ſome men, becauſe I account it no credit to be favoured by them: I intend not to canvaſſe for voices, nor labour a myſterious ſecret, whereby I may gain the general applauſe of the world. I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained what I deſired, <hi>(my Lord)</hi> if I have obtained your approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as being derived from an unerring <hi>principle,</hi> and from an <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> moſt perfectly <hi>illuminated.</hi> God hath beſtowed on you, a <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign</hi> judgement, before the <hi>King</hi> had committed to your hands, his <hi>ſoveraign</hi> Juſtice.

It would argue
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:120345:229"/>
too much impudence to ſend any <hi>drugs</hi> and receipts from a country village to <hi>Paris,</hi> and to undertake the cure of afflicted mindes in a countrey of good Books and great Doctors. Nay, I have ſeen, <hi>Sir,</hi> in your own houſe, a <hi>Megazin</hi> of rare inſtructions and examples, both printed and in hand-writing. And <hi>Juſtus Lipſius,</hi> (had he been your Neighbour) might have made a purchaſe of a <hi>Conſtantia</hi> of a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and better temper, then <hi>her</hi> that he hath beſtowed among us. Since then the whole <hi>maſſe</hi> and mine is in your own power, I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf that you could have deſir'd thoſe few <hi>Grains</hi> that I could furniſh you with, and that being ſo rich your ſelf, you were reſolv'd to exhauſt my poor ſtock too. Taking view from hence at ſo farre diſtance of the eſtate and affairs of our <hi>Frontiers,</hi> I cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly and cleerly beſtowe my judgement on them. I am content to carry about me the thoughts of an honeſt man, and to remove from my minde the diſguſts of ill ſucceſſe with good hopes. I know Sir, that the faireſt kingdomes have ſuffered the viciſſitudes of good and evil; and that the brighteſt <hi>fortune</hi> hath ſome ſpots and <hi>ſhadows;</hi> and knowing this, I cannot think ſtrange of any diſaſters that may happen, or be ſurprized with the news of a revolt, or be any thing amazed with loſſes more then with gains. <hi>Flanders I</hi> confeſſe is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced pretty farre into <hi>Piccardy,</hi> and would have given the like alarm to <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>France</hi> had given <hi>it</hi> the yeer before.

We muſt then confeſſe that Antiquity hath wiſely term'd <hi>God</hi> of Warre <hi>Communem Martem,</hi> that <hi>Homer</hi> never gave it a fitter Epithet then that.

                     <p>SIR, <hi>Courteſie</hi> never denies reſpect to any man, and thinks no mans Preſents mean but her own. This was it (no doubt) that made You ſpeak of me in ſuch an high ſtrain, and ſet ſo great a price upon my Book, which (indeed) is but the worſt part of your <hi>Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</hi> I ſee you will not alter your courſe, or forget your ancient ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, for the which I am infinitely obliged unto you. And if ſome men would needs perſwade me that at other times you handle mee ſomething rudely, yet I cannot believe you do it with an hoſtile hand; on the contrary, I ſuppoſe that in your familiar Letters you give a a true copie and character of your ſelf, but in actions of ceremonie, men require another countenance, and more ſtudied gravity; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, <hi>Sir,</hi> my nature can bear with my friends, and I am not of ſo delicate a ſenſe as to complain of pettie wrongs which I ſuffer-Beſides, that I doe not at all meddle with that Science of diviſion which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If I were put to my choice, I would take a little leſſe of that which puffeth up, and a little more of that which edifieth. <hi>Truth</hi> is not the purchaſe of hot blood, or of incenſed choler, or a diſturbed imagination. The <hi>Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthes</hi> of <hi>Logick</hi> are not the eaſieſt way to heaven, and oft times God hides himſelf from them that ſearch him with over much curioſity. You will avouch (I am ſure) all that I ſay, and this too, Sir, that the beſt quarrels prove nought, and of bad conſequence, and that the contentions of Doctors prove the murthers of their Brethrens ſouls, if they tend not to the peace of the Church; for my part, I can with other vulgar Chriſtians, but wiſh for it; but you can with the <hi>Worthies</hi> of Chriſtian Religion, contribute much towards it, and whenſoever you ſhall preach and teach this, I ſhall aſcribe unto you one of the principal parts of that holy work. But while we expect that this peace be advanced through the grace of God, and that we draw neerer every day one to another, nothing hinders but that we may maintain innocent commerce, and traffick in things lawful. There is no law rightly interpreted that is repugnant to that of Humanity, doth not accord with the law of <hi>Nations.</hi> If our opinions differ, it is not neceſſary that our affections ſhould diſagree; the head and the heart have their ſeveral motions, and actions diſtinct; and moral

vertue can reconcile and unite what the intellectual might ſeparate. Love me therefore ſtill if you pleaſe, ſince you may do it lawfully, and I believe alſo, that I may be without ſcruple, while I live</p>

I went to <hi>Paris,</hi> and which I account for the greateſt buſineſs that I did during my abode there.

And though <hi>I</hi> could not carry away thence but the bare <hi>Idea</hi> of your entertainment, yet beſides that you defrayed the charges of my journey in it, <hi>I</hi> can live here, (yet a while) upon your charges, and feed my thoughts a long time with what <hi>I</hi> have received from your mouth. Yet <hi>I</hi> know not whether a provident managing of <hi>remnants,</hi> may make them laſt alwayes, or whether old <hi>Ideas,</hi> do not at the laſt fade and vaniſh out of the memorie, or whether an expired felicitie may denominate a man ſtill happie. What ever joy your letter ſprang in me, yet (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mark of your abſence) it doth but advertiſe me, that <hi>I</hi> am ſix-ſcore leagues diſtant from the <hi>Author</hi> of my welfare, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>I</hi> can receive but imaginarie painted ſatisfaction, and enjoy but forrain pleaſures.

I cannot diſſemble, I have not this long time <hi>Sir,</hi> ſpent a day more happilie then when I entertained <hi>Her.</hi> And if I have thought <hi>Her</hi> ſo beautiful in her own ſimple weeds, and natural habiliments, without the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe helps which ſerve to embelliſh and adorn; what will it be, when ſhe will appear in the pomp and luſter of the <hi>Theater?</hi> and when thoſe things that are of themſelves ſo powerful, will be mended with the help of the voice and the graces of pronunciation? if I thought <hi>She</hi> were to come forth ſuddainlie in that <hi>Equipage,</hi> I would ſtraight begin my journie for to be preſent at that joyful ſpectacle, and to give you the applauſe which you do juſtlie deſerve. But ſince you have ſent <hi>Her</hi> me, being yet warm from the birth, and that <hi>She</hi> muſt grow up a while and gather ſtrength in your hands, I hope I ſhall be time enough at <hi>Roche</hi> to behold her in her glorie. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>Sir,</hi> in the mean while, that there is a great contention between the <hi>Ladies</hi> about the names of <hi>Orante</hi> and <hi>Ortana,</hi> and that they are more ambitious of the ſcrip and ſheapheards hook then any thing.

                     <p>SIR, The diſorders of a crazie, and ruinous bodie, and the pains I ſuffer by it, are the eternal hinderances of my devoir: Theſe alſo ſhall be (if you pleaſe) the ordinarie <hi>Apologies</hi> for my ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. You may believe, that I do not uſe to make great preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for to treat with you, in reſpect of the familiaritie we profeſſe each to other; and if I could have rendered you thanks ſooner for your courteſies, I would not have ſaved the expence of a few ragged lines, ſo long a time. I have received the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of your friend who doth me more honor then I can deſerve. I cannot ſufficientlie acknowledge the pains that he was pleaſed to take for me, being not ignorant how unpleaſing a thing is <hi>Dependance.</hi> I confeſſe that it is more than a probable argument of a mans love, to ſubmit himſelfe to the fancie of a man that holds no ſuperioritie over him. This ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is irkſome, and ſo heavie a yoak to good wits, that they have ſeldom born it as they ſhould; and <hi>Victorius</hi> obſerves a number of paſſages of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which <hi>Ciceria</hi>

And yet to underſtand an Author aright is not all: things rendered in another language, muſt retain the ſame degree of goodneſs, (if it be poſſible) as was in the <hi>Original:</hi> the ſtrong muſt not be enfeebled, not the well attired be deveſted or clad in raggs, nor thoſe that are well mounted be unhorſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made to ſerve on foot.

It is by your good favor, that I am not of the number of thoſe <hi>Martyrs;</hi> but on the contrarie, your friend hath done me many courteſies which I needed, and furniſht me with a thouſand Ornaments which I had not of mine own.

                        <hi>MY Lord,</hi> You are noble enough to love a man without anie merits, but I were too looſe and forlorn if I were ſo loved, and yet you have ſome cauſe to call me by that bad title; and if <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Girard</hi> hath not had a care of his friends reputation, all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances condemn me. It is true that my fault was but the omiſſion of a Complement, which had ſlipt out of my memorie; and yet I avow to you, that this omiſſion is ſuch a ſin that hath (a long time) burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:120345:237"/>
my conſcience, and cauſeth ſuch gripes and remorſe <hi>Sir,</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſame goodneſs that hath ſhewed me favor do grant me a pardon, I cannot make attonemeat with my ſelf. But I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that for the appeaſing of my thoughts, you will not run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of your former benefits, and that you will by your perſeverance adde to my obligations. Knowing this moreover, that you are a right honeſt man; I muſt neceſſarilie conclude that you are no <hi>Formaliſt</hi> or a man of Ceremonie, and that you do not tie your ſelf to thoſe pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie obſervances and Rites which make the friendſhip of this age more perplext and difficult then ſincere. If <hi>Yours</hi> may be gain'd or merited by a true and perfect valuation of your worth, I will not be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful <hi>Depoſitary,</hi> beſeeching you to believe that I am alreadie as much as anie man in the world</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>SIR,</hi> I did read my own thoughts in your <hi>Letter;</hi> I ſubſcribe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all that you have writ unto me, and confeſſe that in the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of <hi>Monſieur Arnold</hi> the <hi>Abbat,</hi> you do (indeed) but give your friend his due, and lend him never a grain. This is (in truth) a moſt accompliſh't man, and who at the age of 22 yeares, was reputed wiſe even by the <hi>Italians,</hi> that latelie thought wiſdom was their own free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. He hath with his great knowledge mingled much goodneſſe: the ſharpneſſe of his underſtanding is tempered and allaied by the ſweetneſſe of his behaviour, and his modeſtie doth repreſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal much of his abilities. He never pardons himſelf, though he doth beare with all humane infirmities in others; and that Pietie which he doth practiſe, gives reſpect unto all, but ſtrikes a terror in none. Loe <hi>Sir,</hi> the teſtimonie which I add unto yours: which I would beſtow upon an enemie that deſerv'd it, but would not upon a friend that wanted merit. His knowledge is attended on by other vertues, and it hath furniſht him with excellent moralitie: for without this, it ſhould be ſolitarie and of little uſe. I tell you nothing of the late experiment I have found of it in your Letter which he wrote unto you: beſides that my beſt language would be far below my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it; I know withall too well the power of his <hi>Rhetorick</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with it; ſince he hath got ſo manie advantages over me, he muſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:120345:238"/>
needs have that of civilitie and complements too; and my ſilence muſt not be accounted anie more the effect of modeſtie but of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence of his <hi>Letter.</hi> I ſend it you back becauſe you would have it ſo, and becauſe you may make ſome uſe of it in your <hi>Cabinet;</hi> but I ſhall reſerve a Copy of it under your favor, that it may afford ſome comfort and relief to my diſcontents. I have ſeen the ſiege of <hi>Tyre,</hi> the death of <hi>Darius,</hi> the voyage of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and I have read them with wonder. All theſe ſeem to me ſo good <hi>French,</hi> and ſo natural. that it is impoſſible to pick out anie line there, that doth ſavor of, or ſhew anie affinitie with <hi>Latine,</hi> or wherein the original <hi>Author</hi> hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie advantage above the ſecond. What would you have more <hi>Sir,</hi> or what ſentence can you crave of me? I have but one word to adde in commendation of your <hi>Travels.</hi> The <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Philip</hi> was invincible, and that of <hi>Vaugelas</hi> is inimitable. It is that (to ſay no more) that will deſerve the affection of your incomparable <hi>Marchioneſſe,</hi> and the fair <hi>Beavy</hi> or <hi>Troop</hi> that do often aſſemble at her houſe. <hi>Monſieur</hi> — calls <hi>Her a choice and reſplendent Court,</hi> and the <hi>great World refined and reformed:</hi> and ſaith, that there is no <hi>Tribunal</hi> ſo ſoveraign that we may not appeal from, unto the <hi>Manſion</hi> of <hi>Rambouillet.</hi> Since <hi>I</hi> cannot know what kind of work it is that my <hi>Stationer</hi> ſhall give you, until this divine <hi>Romane Deme</hi> ſhall paſſe her cenſure upon it; I dare not as yet, declare my ſelf for a Book which I muſt not acknowledge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>I</hi> have compoſed it. It ſufficeth to tell you, that <hi>I</hi> had an aim to ſpeak <hi>French,</hi> and to write ſome <hi>Letters</hi> which ſhould not put <hi>Her</hi> to trouble of deciphering. I did not heartilie deſire that my Deſign might take effect; and <hi>I</hi> ſhould believe <hi>I</hi> had not gain'd a little, by the commerce of manie years, if what you ſhall preſent her with, in my name, may entertain her thoughts for a few howers; the nobleſt <hi>labors</hi> of the underſtanding cannot aſpire to a higher bliſſe than that; <hi>Philoſophy</hi> her ſelfe ſhould betray too much preſumption to think to take them up whollie and imploy them; ſhe cannot claim to be any more than her <hi>diverſion</hi> and by-thought. <hi>I</hi> ſhall be verie well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented <hi>Sir,</hi> if <hi>I</hi> might ſerve for that purpoſe handſomlie; and <hi>I</hi> ſhould boaſt after this, that <hi>I</hi> were (though in my abſence) verie good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie. That timorouſneſſe that did ever poſſeſſe me that <hi>I</hi> could not be ſo, any other way, and the fear of troubling the ſerenitie of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans viſage by the ſullen clowdineſs of mine, have made me to refrain from all <hi>Feaſts</hi> and <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> and hindered me from bringing heavie looks to thoſe places which <hi>I</hi> eſteem ſacred, and before thoſe eyes which <hi>I</hi> do reverence. So that it is a pure reverence in me, that I abſtain from acceptable and delightful converſation, and from the pleaſures of thoſe <hi>Cabinets</hi> that appertain to them onlie that be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than <hi>I.</hi> And <hi>I</hi> do chuſe rather to adore a far off with awful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,

then be importunatelie, and ſaucilie familiar. <hi>I</hi> leave it to you to excuſe and juſtifie this timoriouſneſſe which proceeds from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, not from a <hi>Stoical</hi> ferocitie. Add you will do me a favor, if that while yon repreſent the beſt part of your friend, you will take the pains to excuſe the worſt.

                        <hi>SIR,</hi> The <hi>Indian</hi> Canes which you ſent me were prettie, but you have ſo embelliſht them at <hi>Rothel,</hi> that <hi>I</hi> doubt me they are not for my turn. They are not made for a private mans uſe: They are <hi>Emblems</hi> of ſoveraign command; and a bolder <hi>Orator</hi> then <hi>I,</hi> would render you thanks rather for your <hi>Scepters</hi> then your Canes. By what name ſoever we call them, they are the more precious to me, becauſe they came from <hi>You,</hi> more then for anie other conſideration; and though you have not made me rich, yet you have made me verie glorious. It is a Maxime in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that <hi>Ambition</hi> is no more ſatisfied with benefits received, then covetouſneſſe. But me thinks, he ſhould have added, when it receives from him, from whom it deſired to receive. For all ſorts of Benefactors do not far obliege thoſe that are ambitious of the better ſort onlie. For my part, I ſhould believe that the Preſents of <hi>Monſieur</hi> — would pollute me, and <hi>I</hi> would be as much aſham'd of his favors as <hi>I</hi> glorie in yours. In truth <hi>Sir, I</hi> have quitted the Countrie, and am come purpoſelie to the Town to ſhew them. With them, <hi>I</hi> do ſuſtain my old age with credit, and look as trim as upon ſolemn daies of Ceremonie. They ſerve me both for to ſupport and to adorn; for moveables of neceſſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and oftentation too. But the worſt is, that <hi>I</hi> have nothing here for to requite ſo rare a Preſent, but the ſhape and lineaments of a <hi>vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> man, and the ſad repreſentation of my own viſage. As it were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie unjuſt that <hi>I</hi> ſhould pretend to beautie: ſo it is a verie <hi>ſoleciſme</hi> that <hi>Philarchus</hi> calls me a <hi>Narciſſus.</hi> But there are alwaies fooliſh paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and idle curioſities in the world. My friends at <hi>Paris</hi> would needs urge me to have my Picture drawn, and <hi>I,</hi> to give them contentment, did yield my ſelfe for one halfe houre to be tranſcribed, and granted them this <hi>meager</hi> delight.

Such a place in your <hi>Cabinet,</hi> is indeed a high ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, and which I cannot obtain but by meer favor; but that which you have given me in your heart is no leſſe precious to me, and I think I have good right to the poſſeſſion, ſince I am reallie</p>

ſmall ſatiſfaction and contentment to me, to ſee that J hold a place in a memory, that is ſo occupied and fully fraught as yours.

                        <hi>Sir,</hi> You had an intention to perform an act of humilitie; when you did dedicate your Poem to me; for to expect protection from a man that is not reckoned of the world, and light from a name ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure as mine, you could not (ſure) forget your ſelf in this ſort. The ſame virtue which obligeth the <hi>Saints</hi> to acknowledge <hi>Superiors</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there are men, hath carried you to this depth of lowlineſſe; and you have choſen an unhappy man, for to beſtowe honor upon, that you might loſe that, which you would fain beſtow, I muſt confeſſe, that no man ever commended his Neighbor more Chriſtian like, and doth more decline the Trade of thoſe <hi>Mercenaries,</hi> who ſell their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies and credit to any, that have wherewith to requite them.

                        <hi>Sir,</hi> Having your perſon in great admiration, I cannot miſprize or undervalue your friendſhip. The fair tokens whereof, which I

have received in the <hi>Letter,</hi> that you were pleaſed to write unto me, have obliged me ſo far, that <hi>I</hi> confeſſe that I owe you alreadie that which you are pleaſed now to promiſe me. I will tell you but this, that if <hi>Princes</hi> could beſtow health and vertue, I ſhould tell more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous <hi>Courtier</hi> then I am, and ſhould ſtand in more need of your te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie, and the recommendation of your friend. But truly, in the caſe that I am, my deſires are ſo feeble, and my paſſions ſo cold and languid, that I could hardly be perſwaded to take up a <hi>Croſier,</hi> if I found it on the earth. Though <hi>Philoſophy</hi> doth not teach, that we muſt ſeek for happineſs out of the wheeling <hi>Orbe</hi> of the <hi>Court;</hi> my own la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs would cauſe me to apprehend it as a fortune, under whoſe weight I ſhould perpetuallie groan, and not a place of any eaſe; and I do leſſe eſteem of a place of Government that might cumber me, then a field of libertie that may ſolace me. If you go any time into <hi>Gaſcony,</hi> and do me the honor to take my houſe in the way, you will verifie what I ſay to you; and avouch, that if I were as well cured of all maladies as that of <hi>Ambition</hi> I had not many wiſhes to commence. It is true that ſome companie (like that of <hi>Monſieur</hi> your <hi>Brother</hi>) is wanting unto me; and if this were added to my <hi>Hermitage,</hi> I durſt contend with <hi>Jupiter</hi> for happineſs. This is a ſpeech of <hi>Epicurus</hi> which <hi>Seneca</hi> doth alleage, but which I do mean to apply better then it was by the <hi>Author;</hi> ſince bread and beare (which this <hi>Philoſopher</hi> made the two <hi>Elements</hi> of ſoveraign good) are not ſo rare or ſo good, as thoſe excellent inſtructions and perfect honeſtie, which I ſhould finde and injoy in the perſon of my friend. I do charge you to aſſure him, that I do ever honor and eſteem him infinitelie, and for your particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, you may believe, that you cannot affect a man that could be more ſincerelie then I am,</p>

You know <hi>Sir,</hi> more then any other, that my paſſions are not cloſe and reſerved, but J carrie my ſoul ſtill in my prehead. When J was not as yet, ſo far your Servant as now J am, J
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:120345:245"/>
did not uſe much <hi>Artifice,</hi> and diſſimulation to perſwade the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; and thence you might have deduc'd an infallible concluſion, that if I had chang'd my inclination, I would not have deceived you with new proteſtations of fidelitie. I do therefore religiouſly proteſt unto you, that honoring you with that zeal as I do, you could not inflict a greater puniſhment upon me, then the forfeiture of your favors. But moreover, I do ſwear to you by all that is <hi>ſacred</hi> in the world, that I have committed nothing that might deſerve ſuch a cruel puniſhment. After this me thinks you might be confirm'd in the truth, but pardon me if I tell you, you ſhould have been ſo before; and that I do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamlie wonder, that a weak and groſſe calumnie, ſhould quite ruine and deface in your thoughts, the good impreſſions, which I thought I had left there. I cannot hinder mens miſ-conſtructions of me, or binde <hi>Interpreters</hi> from doing violence, and putting my words upon the rack, to make them depoſe things which were far from my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Sophiſters</hi> make uſe of a true propoſition to infer an erroneous concluſion; and <hi>Pettiſoggers</hi> ſtill cite the Law, to authoriſe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and yet none will tax truth to be the cauſe of error, or Law the mother of injuſtice. I cannot warrant, but my own thoughts (which are ſound and innocent) not thoſe of my adverſaries, which are full of malice and rancor. I am reſponſible for the things that I have written, and readie withall to maintain them. But all the <hi>viſions</hi> and fancies of men are not in my power. Everie man can make a nimble and ſubtle decipherer of another mans intentions. The ſame picture, according to ſeveral <hi>lights</hi> and poſtures, may have ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations; and often times there is a great difference between a Text and the Commentaries, the meaning of the <hi>Author</hi> and the <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſmes</hi> of <hi>Grammarians.</hi> I ſaid that I knew <hi>ſome ſtrange inſufferable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and no way fit to poſſeſſe and ſway free-born men.</hi> Therefore I ſaid, that a man, whom I do infinitelie eſteem and honor was of that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor. Loe here <hi>Sir,</hi> (not to ſay half of what I think of it) a concluſion verie unworthie a <hi>Logician,</hi> and which is as far from common, as from my particular ſenſe. Jndeed it was not you, that deduced it, yet you ſhould not have entertain'd it at ſecond hand, and if it did not ſeem to you to be palpably falſe, yet you might have demurr'd a while, and ſuſpected it; you have done your ſelfe wrong and me too, in conceiving ſo bad a thought of your own merit and my fidelitie; in expreſſing that you have ſome diſtruſt of your ſelf, who are of no mean value, and but verie little confidence in me, whoſe freeneſs is ſomething worth. I have but little skill in <hi>fallacies,</hi> and a mean Jugler may ſometimes gain credit with me: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, I ſhould never have been thus ſurpris'd and deluded, and when you have wrote to me in a dozen Letters at leaſt, that you knew ſome
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:120345:246"/>
men that <hi>wrote pernicious Books,</hi> and maintained <hi>Heretical Propoſitions:</hi> I did not yield to ſuch an imagination that this did reflect upon me; and when you ſent a Lackey into this Province, I did not forbear to ſend you commendations by him. You ſee that I am ſtung, and therefore am ſencible. If your love were not deare unto me, I could well enough bear your neglect of me; and if my <hi>zeale</hi> to you were not ſtrong, I ſhould endeavor to ſolace my ſelfe, after your ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating of me. But becauſe I love, I would be requited with love; and I cannot brook to be taxt with a fault, which I thought did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſo much as ſuſpition. <hi>Sir,</hi> I am upon the point to publiſh a new Volum of <hi>Letters,</hi> where there be ſome which I have written unto you and others, where I make mention of you, as your virtues did oblige me; and where will be one alſo, wherein (as ſome would perſwade you) I am injurious to you. How I pray, can all theſe agree? can I be both your friend and your foe at once? can I blowe with the ſame mouth, both hot and cold? can the literal ſenſe favor you, and the allegorical injure you? can I do you wrong, when I muſt needs wrong my ſelfe? ſhall I give an occaſion of diſtaſt by ambiguous termes, where I muſt make my ſelf ridiculous by apparent contradictions? This was it <hi>Sir,</hi> that was ſuggeſted to your credulitie, and which you did not reject at firſt acquaintance, as I had reaſon to expect from your good diſcretion. Theſe were the falſe ſurmiſes which were brought before you, wherein you found more ſemblance of truth, then in the ſincere proteſtations which I made to you. I cannot conceive (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you have continued your friendſhip towards me, and that I too have not loſt my reaſon) how you could imagine, that I intended in a bravery to diſingage you, and by <hi>thoſe aukeward ſpirits which I had known,</hi> I aim'd directly at you, and might not deſigne ſome other as well. I know a great many of the <hi>Gaſcons,</hi> and as there be ſome of them very moderate, ſo alſo there be others that are not ſo. I knowe ſome of <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Corſica,</hi> and I am not ignorant of their natural gentleneſs; I knowe ſome <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and I know how agreeable is their yoak with that which they call <hi>Caſtiga vellacos.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, you may believe that I have not travelled blindfold, &amp; I had in vain converſed with men, if I had not endeavored to know them; and yet in this particular, men would fain make all my acquaintance to be terminated in you, and that I have pardoned a thouſand <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriſts</hi> in the world (to whom my propoſition might be applied) for to violate you. They ſurmiſe, that having an aim to wound ſome body, I made choice of one of my chiefeſt friends for my mark; and that I have murmur'd cloſely and in dark language, that <hi>He is rough and violent,</hi> whom I proclaim every where, and with loud
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:120345:246"/>
accent, for <hi>compleatly wiſe and noble.</hi> I will not cite unto you mean te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, for the confirmation of this truth. I can alleage <hi>My Lord,</hi> the Duke of — and <hi>My Lord</hi> the Count of — of whom is here queſtion made. They know both of them, how far I am your Servant, and with what ſervencie I did maintain your honor and intereſts, on a time when occaſion was preſented. I am willing to believe that your other friends might ſerve you in ſome ſtead in ſome other encounters; but in this here, all the whole Company (I except no man) was mute. There was not any there, but my ſelfe that ſpake ſtrenuouſlie in your behalf, concerning thoſe things that did reflect upon you; and the boldneſſe of my affection carried me ſo far, that the <hi>Lords,</hi> whom I now named unto you, did give me a publick teſtimony, and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, (though with a little diſguſt) that <hi>I</hi> was too good a friend to make a <hi>Countier</hi> of. I am therefore ſomething agrieved at this time, to be requited thus with oblequie, where I thought <hi>I</hi> had deſerved thanks; to have preſerved my fidelity inviolable towards you, and now to be accuſed of treacherie; to be the onely man in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence on that occaſion, whereof you have cauſe to boaſt, and now to be the onely man of whom you complain. <hi>I</hi> do not uſe to value my ſervices which <hi>I</hi> perform to my friends, and <hi>I</hi> am content to ſtand up for them manfullie, without making unto them an account of my proweſſe. Moreover <hi>Sir,</hi> this betrayes grief, more then preſumption, and may be termed defending, rather then upbraiding; Theſe are reſentments which accompanie innocence that is offended; and which your facilitie (abuſed by the malice of another) doth force from my heart againſt my will <hi>I</hi> will not conceal it from you, you have made a deep wound in it, it makes me think in all my dreams of the injuſtice which <hi>I</hi> ſuffer at your hand, and you had utterlie loſt any friend, that had been leſſe firm then my ſelfe; by putting him to ſuch a hazard. Wherefore <hi>Sir,</hi> for all the revenge that <hi>I</hi> deſire for the injurie which <hi>I</hi> have received, take it not amiſſe, that <hi>I</hi> give you this advice, that you give leſſe credit hereafter to another, and more to your ſelfe; that you would be more jealous of thoſe opinions that you have conceived upon your firſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a buſineſſe, and leſſe affected to the rumors of the Citie, which are not grounded upon any ſolid foundation. You ſhould conſider the place from whence theſe quaint Newes have travelled; weigh the circumſtances of the thing, examine by what ſpirit the accuſer was led thereunto: and not examine his perſon onely, and paſſion, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts; but alſo the deſervings of the <hi>party</hi> accuſed, his manner and behavior of life, and his former actions: ſuſpend your judgement at leaſtwiſe, until time ſhall give you a more exact &amp; particular informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of buſineſſes; otherwiſe you ſhall never want diſquiet and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:120345:247"/>
and you ſhould thus but feed upon ſuſpicion and diſtruſt, which are verie unwholſome viands. Men muſt not ſend you relations of whatſoever an undiſcreet friend or ſome rude ſturdie ſervant, or ſuch and ſuch a Neighbor ſhall report unto — they muſt have more care of the tranquillitie of your minde; and likewiſe for your part, you muſt not ſweare unto the teſtimonies of all the <hi>Informers,</hi> that have a plot upon your credulitie, and take pleaſure in the pain and exerciſe which they put you unto. If you allow an open gate for all tales and ſuggeſtions to enter in, they will throng into your houſe apace, and <hi>firſt come, firſt heard.</hi> To day, they will inform you (and perhaps with ſpecious colours too) that your <hi>Privadoes</hi> do divulge your ſecrets; and to morrow that your <hi>Domeſticks</hi> do rob and rifle you; and at laſt that all the world is your enemy, and all private conferences, are but conſpiracies againſt you. I conjure you <hi>Sir,</hi> for your own peace, not to give ſo much credit to thoſe things which do no way concern Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor to abandon your ſelf to thoſe Relators, who pretend to diſpel melancholie, when they are fit for nothing but to whiſper fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies into your eares, and to calumniate with a good grace: make a diſtinction betwixt the fraudulent <hi>Arts</hi> of <hi>Paraſites</hi> and the freedom of ingenious men; between thoſe that adore <hi>Fortune,</hi> and thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard nothing but <hi>Vertue.</hi> For my part, I declare freelie unto you, that if <hi>Monſieur</hi> the — were rais'd again, and would commit his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie to your hands, I ſhould not do <hi>that</hi> to regain your favor, what I do now perform in regard of our friendſhip. At leaſtwiſe I ſhould be more ſtern and ſtubborn (then I am) in my diſpleaſure, and more obſtinate in ſeeking to you, and leſſe ſolicitous of the event of my ſeeking. But I have not yet the skill to complie with the times, and to be ſtill on <hi>Fortunes</hi> ſide; J profeſſe ſuch an <hi>auſtere</hi> honeſtie and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that is not of the preſent times.

                        <hi>SIR,</hi> There is no way to beare any longer with the <hi>contumacy</hi> of your ſilence, <hi>I</hi> have ſent this Meſſenger of purpoſe to make you ſpeak, and to tell you (though with ſome diſtaſte to you) that you have loſt your memorie; and that is no leſſe then the third part of your ſoul. So that there remain but the <hi>underſtanding</hi> and the <hi>will,</hi> wherein I have (perhaps) ſome nook and ſeat. You have promiſed me wonders, and performed juſt nothing; you did owe me a viſit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after your voyage to <hi>Sainctes,</hi> and ſince that, you might have gone to <hi>Rome</hi> and come back again. You ſee here great cauſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content; nevertheleſſe <hi>I</hi> am ſo facile, that if you would but bereave your ſelfe of the pleaſures of the Court for three or four dayes, I would ſeal you a general <hi>Pardon</hi> for all that is paſt, and account you as honeſt a man as ever I did before. While <hi>I</hi> expect this reaſonable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction which you cannot denie me, be pleaſed to acquaint <hi>my Lord</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Rochefoucaut</hi> that <hi>Monſieur de Nantes</hi> is extreamlie troubled that he cannot receive the honor which he would willinglie pay him by comming to viſit him in theſe parts. He expects this morning ſome tidings from <hi>my Lord,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> for to render himſelf where he ſhall appoint him to finde him; and I look upon him as upon a bleſſing which I expect to loſe everie moment. If he were not preparing to <hi>Maſſe</hi> he would gnifie unto him his diſcontents himſelf, and the earneſt deſire he hath to make his Son one of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries</hi> of our Church. He findes the buſineſſe ſo for advanced, that there will be no great difficultie to effect the reſt, and that his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction is ſo happie, that a little cultivation will produce rare and excellent fruits. Do me the favor as to deliver to <hi>Monſieur</hi> his eldeſt Son the <hi>Panegyricke</hi> framed for the King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> together with the Letter which I wrote the laſt Summer to 
poor —. This is not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend unto him the memorie of her: I know that ſhe is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deare unto him: nor to put him into any affright; for men of his ſort do apprehend nothing but diſhonor. I deſire only that he ſhould ſee that my poor judgement doth ſometimes jump with good underſtandings, and that <hi>I</hi> had the honor to be his <hi>Rivall</hi> in one paſſion that he hath harbored. If you do not ſend me by my Man the Diſcourſe of — <hi>garniſhed</hi> with <hi>Notes</hi> and Commentaries, I ſhall
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:120345:248"/>
have a new cauſe of quarrel; and do not you think that I betake my ſelf to <hi>Monſieur</hi> — for them, this is an <hi>Oracle</hi> (indeed) that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes readie to anſwer, but I feare me, that you have not alwayes devotion enough to conſult with him. Adieu <hi>Sir,</hi> I am abſolutelie</p>

                        <hi>SIR,</hi> I believe that you will not be offended with a Petition that this Bearer ſhall commence unto you in my behalf. Your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe carrieth you ſo far at to love your Perſecutors; and you have entertained ſo favourablie my firſt importunities, that I ſtand not now in feare, of making <hi>motions.</hi> If you had given me, the repulſe at firſt, you had taught me the vertue of diſcretion, and provided better for your own quietneſſe. But the force of example is dangerous: the evil doth ſuddenlie inſinuate and growe familiar, and treads oft that way, which it was wont to meaſure. So that I think that I have now ſome colour of juſtice to torment you; and it is habitual unto me to abuſe a thing, when I have not found difficultie enough to make me uſe it with moderation. I ſhall continue <hi>Sir,</hi> an importunate Begger till you forget to be generous: and do no doubt; but I knowe how to make uſe of a good ſo diffuſive and beneficial, as in your Amitie. You ſhall travel to day for the good of my eſtate, becauſe there is a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel;</hi> and to morrow for the good of my ſoul, becauſe there is a <hi>Sermon;</hi> that I may acknowledge you my friend, for my ſpiritual as well as temporal good, and that you may receive my thanks, both in this and the other world. That which you are to pronounce with gracefulneſſe of action, and cannot well be communicated in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, hath notwithſtanding alreadie given me infinite delight upon paper. I have never ſeen our <hi>Myſteries</hi> illuſtrated with ſo much light of eloquence, nor <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſo ſuccesfullie imployed in the ſervice of <hi>Faith,</hi> nor <hi>Chriſtian Moralitie</hi> better ſeaſon'd, to make it reliſh well in profane palates. But in this particular, I would fain be leſſe behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you, that <hi>I</hi> might have the more freedom, and be able to aſſure you (without any ſuppoſition of engagement, or ſign of acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) that I admire all your Muſes univerſallie, both the <hi>politer</hi> and the <hi>ſeverer</hi> ones; both thoſe that can compoſe <hi>Hymnes</hi> and <hi>Anthems,</hi>

                        <hi>SIR,</hi> Be of good courage, and ſtart not at the opening of my packet; I do aſſure you beforehand, that it is not my <hi>Ghoſt</hi> that talks to you, and that the Letter that I write unto you, doth not come from the other world. The rumor which was ſcattered concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my death, hath not killed me; and I am yet, (ſince it is the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God) a witneſs of his works, and an <hi>Adorer</hi> of his power. I have ere this, received the alarm of the like newes; but I am no longer credulous to dreams and preſages; my ſoul doth not labor with thoſe <hi>popular</hi> infirmities: And I do conſent with that <hi>Grecian,</hi> that all the wiſhes of enemies, all the imprecations of <hi>Poets,</hi> and all the falſe bruits of <hi>Fame,</hi> are not able to bring on our <hi>deſtiny</hi> one houre the ſooner. There is a Gentleman in <hi>Gaſcoigne,</hi> who is chronicled to have been ſlain in the battle of <hi>Yury;</hi> and he is yet verie well notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and means to live long. I am <hi>Sir,</hi> of the ſame humor too, and confeſſe to you that I do not much hate my life, though I have little cauſe to love it. Your <hi>Stationers</hi> indeed did not believe this: they have handled me as though I had been dead indeed, and have magined withall, that they be my rightful Heyres <hi>ex aſſe,</hi> having eized upon the firſt papers of mine that they could meet with. I am omething apprehenſive of this injury, and it ſhould grieve me if <hi>Monſieur</hi> — ſhould be the <hi>Author</hi> of it; becauſe I ſhould then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it with more impatience yet. To ſay truth, if this be not to wound and violate (downright) the Law of Nations, it is (at leaſt) to deflowre and taint it: and you will confeſſe with me, that it could not be pleaſing unto me, that the — ſhould be publiſht without asking my conſent thereunto. Had it been ſo, I ſhould not have been perhaps very averſe, and <hi>I</hi> ſhould have deſired him onely to alter ſomething for my ſake, and ſomething for his own. For though his underſtanding be paſſing good, yet you know well, that our <hi>Grammatians</hi> do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his ſtile for regular; and though their ſcruples be ill groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:120345:249"/>
yet they muſt be conſidered. That which I would fain have changed, and where I thought I had ſome ſmall intereſt, was one word, which nay ancient Enemie had alreadie miſerablie mangled; and which, (not wanting ſpirit and life in its natural place) doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble thoſe delicate plants, which die as ſoon as they be tranſplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their own <hi>banks.</hi> But remedie comes now too tardie. I muſt comfort my ſelfe againſt this, as well as other injuries. This is but dallying to former wrongs; and ſuch pinches ſhould well be born with, by a man that never uſeth to complain of <hi>Treaſons</hi> and <hi>Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates.</hi> For your ſatisfaction <hi>Sir,</hi> let it ſuffice that I have a perfect knowledge of your wiſdom and honeſtie, and that I would truſt you with my life, my honor, and my fortunes. If I had had ſo baſe a thought as to ſuſpect you in this dealing, I ſhould believe that I were bound to do penance for my ſuſpition. <hi>I</hi> know that you are everie way virtuous, and my firm friend, as <hi>I</hi> am verie reallie</p>

This is not the firſt time that that poor <hi>Wit</hi> hath ſtrayed ſo. He hath been this long time ridiculous without being facetious, and hath been a laughing-ſtock to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and an object of pitty to the wiſe. The late <hi>Monſieur</hi> — did uſe to call him the greateſt enemy that ever <hi>Reaſon</hi> had, between <hi>Cales</hi> and <hi>Bayonne;</hi> and ſaid, he was a fool in two Sciences, and in four Languages. Nevertheleſſe, if our friend ſhall think him worthie of ſome traces of his pen, let us indulge him that exerciſe, with this <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſoe,</hi> that he be not violent, and that he put not himſelfe to a heat; that (if it pleaſe him) he do not deal ſeriouſly with him, or arm him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at all points, againſt an <hi>Adverſary</hi> that deſerves not any encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but with pins.

                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:120345:249"/>
muſt be excited for eight dayes together, to the crueltie of hearing any man whatſoever, for one half an houre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is not my intention to write againſt <hi>Monſieur</hi> — but to diſcourſe with him; and I have not ſo little wit, but that I can diſtinguiſh his perſon from his cauſe. He hath obliged me with ſo good grace, and ſpoken of me in ſuch high language and ſumptuous terms, that I cannot doubt of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, or his affection towards me. And he ſhall likewiſe ſee my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of it, through the whole file of my diſcourſe; wherein <hi>I</hi> am reſolved to temper my ſelf ſo diſcreetlie, that if I perſwade him not to my opinion, I ſhall not make my proceedings odious; and if I do not reſt ſatisfied with what he faith, I ſhall contradict him but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, and with a kind of <hi>Biaſſe,</hi> which ſhall not be diſtaſtful unto him. This will be (perhaps) the firſt example of modeſtie, that hath been heard of among the diſputants of this age; and we will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to thoſe of that ſide, who talk outragiouſlie in <hi>Problems</hi> of ſmall importance; that the altercations of honeſt men are without choler, and that generous enemies live better together then malicious <hi>Burghers.</hi> For the reſt <hi>Sir,</hi> I deſire you to continue the pains that you have begun, and to ſend me wherewith, J may fortifie all the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches</hi> that are liable to aſſault and batterie. I ſhall feare nothing, being strengthned with ſo powerful ſuccors; and you will juſtifie my cauſe if it be good, or give it a colour of juſtice, if it be not ſo. See what an enterpriſe it was in you to love me: You could never have conceived a more pernicious deſign for your ſelfe.

                     <p>
                        <hi>SIR,</hi> Your favor: have exhauſted my thanks, I cannot chuſe but acquaint you, that I do repoſſeſſe my old pieces again, and that your love is ſtill ingenious in obliging thoſe whom you affect. I doubt not but that the courteſies that I have received from <hi>Monſieur de</hi> — are the effects of your teſtimonies of me; and I muſt aſcribe all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment that <hi>I</hi> have received thereby to your preparation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. There is no ſubject ſo vile and mean but gains price by your eſtimation. You have found the trick or ſecret to make objects ſwell beyond their proportion <hi>ad infinitum;</hi> and to <hi>ſtamp</hi> a man <hi>Illuſtrious,</hi> though of a very abject condition. I came to know him by the <hi>civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of —, which are far different from the <hi>brevadoes</hi> of —. Are not theſe the moſt tyranical ſpirits in the world? that ſhould ſay that I could hinder, that any Books ſhould be written or publiſhed, at a hundred leagues diſtance? that is, that I ſhould maintain an <hi>Agent</hi> in all the Printing-houſes of <hi>France,</hi> that ſhould prevent the publication of <hi>Antiphilarkes.</hi> Theſe <hi>Meſſieurs</hi> that have handled me in ſuch a ſort, that fire and poyſon would ſeem to an <hi>Italian</hi> too gentle tortures to revenge their crueltie, are at this time, offended (for ſooth) that I ſhould be furniſhed with ſo much as a <hi>Buckler,</hi> and that <hi>I</hi> ſhould be offered a Sanctuarie. They demand a reaſon of me why a man, whom I never knew, ſhould take compaſſion on <hi>Innocence</hi> oppreſt, and could not endure the noiſe and inſolence of their falſe triumphs, which I ſhould not do neither, <hi>dear Friend,</hi> if I would give vent and libertie to my grief, and that nature ſuffered not in the ſuppreſſion of ſo juſt complaint. And yet I muſt continue to do her violence, and deſerve the approbation of <hi>Monſieur</hi> our <hi>Prelate.</hi> I beg from you his good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, and deſire you both to believe that I am affectionatelie</p>

The importance is, to commence it with an opinion that it is feaſible, and with a reſolution to carrie; for if rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be urged timorouſlie, and if a man do not deſcend ſtreight from generalities to particulars, a thouſand journies unto the — will not be worth one; and we ſhould but take much pains to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. <hi>Monſieur de</hi> — ſhall pardon me, if I do not finde my ſelfe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hardlie, or ſtrong enough to undertake the work which he hath done me the honor to deſign me for; and for ſuch a taske, a more peaceable and happy <hi>retreat,</hi> and a more practis'd and expert <hi>quill</hi> then mine, are requiſite.

I never believed that their <hi>Superior</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed me nothing. If he hath left them no other debts to pay but this, they have great cauſe to commend him for his good providence and thrift. In the mean while, I cannot diſſemble my ſorrow to you for his death, nor forget to tell you, that in all his ill carriages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, he hath never done me a greater affront then this, <hi>to die.</hi> If <hi>I</hi> had ſome particular Revelation concerning it, or if he had adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed me thereof by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Prophecie,</hi> which is ſpoken of in his <hi>Elegy,</hi> he ſhould have ſeen his prating long ſince condemned, and ſhould not have carried away into the other world, that great opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſufficiencie, which his fraternitie did ſooth him with. For the other extravagant Doctor, which you mention, it would not be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God Almightie, that I ſhould undertake his reformation; it were needful to create him anew, for to amend him. It were no mean enterpriſe but to examine his book, and to make a <hi>breviaty</hi> of all the abſurd things therein contained.

But a main difference is, that this man was a <hi>Poet,</hi> and did but act grief: but I am truly afflicted; and true friendſhip doth really ſuffer more then flattery can perſonate. I am very ſorry that — hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned himſelf towards you ſo well as he ſhould have done; and if you have reſolved upon his ruine, I do not mean to ſtep in between him and it, and undertake his protection. I do ever ſide with all your paſſions without premeditation; and that man that doth not pleaſe you, hath no allurements ſo powerful, as can render him pleaſing to me: nevertheleſſe, if this mans offence were <hi>venial,</hi> and your juſtice could be ſatisfied; I would adventure to beg his pardon, and would become his ſurety, that he ſhould willingly undergoe all the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that you would inflict upon him, to regain your favor. There are ſome buſineſſes between us, that force me to diſſemble a little, and do not permit an apparent <hi>runture,</hi> if there come not from you an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs order to the contrary But being once freed out of this turmoil,

if he be ſo unlucky as to offend you again, I declare unto you that I do even now renounce him; and I had rather forget my obligations to him, then to carry affections repugnant to yours. Your <hi>Couſen</hi> is too generous to oblige (ſo nobly) a man whom he never knew; and I had rather believe, that his eſteem of me, is but the conſequence of your love, then to imagine it to be an apprehenſion of any merit in me. I do purpoſe a voyage beyond the Seas the next year; If I take ſhip at <hi>Diepe,</hi> as I hope to do, I ſhall not fail to go and kiſſe <hi>His</hi> hands at <hi>Roan;</hi> and to make him ſee that the <hi>Monſter,</hi> that <hi>Father Goulie</hi> ſpeaks of, is a tame Beaſt, (at leaſt) and capable of knowledge. If I did exceedingly rejoyce at the news, when a <hi>Canonſhip</hi> was beſtowed upon you, I forgot how far this <hi>Dignity</hi> was below your deſerts. It ſufficeth me, that <hi>I</hi> give you ſome teſtimony that I am not ſorry for it; and that I conſider it (as in the croud) among other Benefices that ſhall fall upon you; knowing that ſome few mens lives (that be not yet dead) are the onely obſtacles to your <hi>Vertues.</hi> I expect by the firſt <hi>Poſt,</hi> ſome better news concerning your health, and ever remain with all my ſoul</p>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:120345:255"/>
ſo <hi>praiſe-worthy.</hi> It is true, that for the intereſt of her honor, it will be ſomething material, to underſtand the cauſe that made my intentions to be miſconſtrued, and that <hi>I</hi> lead you to the verie ſource of this jealouſie; whereas, it ſeemed to certain <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> my friends, that J did too much approve of her ſingular humor, and frequent retirings, one of the moſt eloquent of them took a fancie to publiſh his diſlike in this point; and to write a reproachful <hi>Letter</hi> unto me in the name (as he ſaith) of the whole <hi>Corporation of honeſt men.</hi> Wherein he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes open warre againſt me in their name, as though I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired againſt <hi>fair Society;</hi> and calls me the <hi>Common enemy; the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally jealous man,</hi> the <hi>Tyrant</hi> to both ſexes. He doth imagine that it is my intent to ſhut up in priſon all fair and delectable things, for to puniſh curious eyes. He cries out, that I would fain abrogate the ſweeteſt lawes of this <hi>Realm,</hi> and bring in the crueltie of that cuſtom in <hi>Spain,</hi> where honeſt women are mewd up in Cages, and honeſt men adore but doors and windowes. From <hi>Madrid,</hi> he paſſeth to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and tells me in a great rage, that I am good for nothing but to be a Counceller of the great <hi>Turk,</hi> for to adviſe him to raiſe the walls of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> higher, and to double the <hi>Guard</hi> of the <hi>Sultana;</hi> Then he doth accuſe me for a thouſand miſchiefs, and takes me for <hi>Him</hi> that invented the iron grates, the locks the vails and maskes: and for the author of all thoſe things that oppoſe his <hi>intruſion</hi> and <hi>ſaucy</hi> curioſitie. Inſomuch that he imagines that I muſt render him a reaſon of the <hi>ſecrets</hi> and difficulties of all riddles; of the darkneſs of all ancient <hi>Oracles;</hi> of the <hi>Allegories</hi> of <hi>Poets,</hi> and of the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of all <hi>Religions.</hi> To make anſwer to farre leſſe then this, it behoved me to ſtudie a long <hi>Apologie;</hi> and (as ill luck was) when I received his Letter, I was not in the humor of making Books. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Sir,</hi> I profeſſe to you trulie, I choſe rather to yield then defend my ſelfe, and abandon my <hi>Maxims</hi> to the <hi>verboſity</hi> of my good friend, rather then maintain them with the <hi>expence</hi> of ſo many words as he did plie them with: But if J be not deceived, there is a good deal of difference between my <hi>Maxims</hi> and the praiſes of <hi>Madam d' Anguitar;</hi> and he muſt take heed of confounding in the deſign that J have, that which I have diſtinguiſhed in the Letter which I wrote unto <hi>Her.</hi> To ſay that <hi>She</hi> is one of the <hi>Perfections</hi> of the world, is an immoveable truth, for which I would ſight all my life time: But to ſay that ſuch <hi>Perfections</hi> muſt be ſequeſtered from the eyes of men, is (I ſuppoſe) a <hi>probematical</hi> opinion, which I may revoke without prejudice to my own conſtancie, or to the worth of theſe <hi>Perfections.</hi> But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, moſt will be apt to believe, that this will be ſufficient amends, and juſt ſatisfaction for the injurie I did them, in condemning them to ſolitude and retiredneſſe; and will call it their revoking from <hi>exile</hi>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:120345:256"/>
and releaſing out of bondage. Thus <hi>Sir,</hi> I preſerve ſtill my firſt <hi>Deſign;</hi> and my commendations remain whole and intire among the ruines of my <hi>Maxims.</hi> Nay out of their demolitions, <hi>Trophies</hi> might be erected to the honor of <hi>Madam d' Anguitar,</hi> and a <hi>Theater</hi> built, where ſhe might be gazed upon, by thoſe that can but divine &amp; gueſſe at <hi>Her;</hi> and that the <hi>Deſart</hi> might no longer have ſuch advantage over the City. This is not then to rebel againſt her <hi>Vertues,</hi> but to wiſh Her a more ſpacious <hi>Empire,</hi> and a greater number of Subjects then <hi>She</hi> hath had, nor to go about to eclipſe her light, but to adjudge, that She ſhould iſſue forth out of the Clouds, for the benefit and comfort of the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</hi> I pitty thoſe <hi>Criticks</hi> that take it otherwiſe; and am ſorry that <hi>Monſieur</hi> — is fallen upon a thought ſo far diſtant from mine He might have underſtood me well enough, without putting me to the pains of interpreting my ſelf; and might have ſeen (moreover) that though in this occaſion I would not at all conſider the intereſts of another, yet <hi>I</hi> ſhould have conſidered my own at leaſt. Doth he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that I could have been perſwaded to ſpoil at one daſh, one of the deareſt iſſues of my brain? and to bereave my ſelfe of the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements of one of the greateſt Perſonages of the world, who thinks her ſelfe in ſome meaſure beholding unto me? <hi>I</hi> am no ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to my ſelf, or ſo prodigal of the good that I have acquired.

there is no way to put off ſo juſt an office as this to another time, and (though with hazard of incongruities, and offending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Grammer</hi> Rules) you muſt receive from me theſe three or four ragged lines.

But his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that took him the very day that he arrived thither, and mine, which would wait no longer to attach me, did force me to take my way back to my V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>llage, where I found your Meſſages, and my Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers. I render you once more, moſt humble thanks for the care you took to keep them for me; and ſince you are pleaſed that I make uſe of you, with ſuch familiarity, you muſt permit my thankful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement thereof. The newes you wrote unto me, concerning the ſickneſs of — was told me at <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> when I was there; and I ſwear unto you, I have not ſlept a good ſleep ſince. This is as good a man as ever I was acquainted with, and I do mainly eſteem him; becauſe I know him to the very heart, where (without faining) I have found nothing but what was noble, and (I dare ſpeak it) <hi>magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous.</hi> I know that his out ſide hath been diſpleaſing to many; But men muſt not alwayes be judged by the lineaments of the face; and that averſation is unjuſt, which ſprings onely out of deformity. I do much wonder that two words which I have written to my <hi>Stationer,</hi> being half a ſheep, are flown out of his ſhop already. I aſſure you I am no — nor do not uſe to put on ſeverity in reading theſe kinds of <hi>Relatiosn.</hi> But (in truth) this here did give me much content; and though I meet with ſome paſſages that might be altered without any harm, and where a decorum was not ſo exactly obſerved as it might have been; nevertheleſs, (to ſpeak in the general) the invention, to my thinking, was handſome, the narration neat and ſmooth, and the ſtile all favoring of the Court and Cabinet. When you have read it, I will think of it, as you ſhall pronounce the ſentence; in the mean while, I uſe the liberty allowed in points not yet decided; and the <hi>interim,</hi> that you are too good to agree with me, until you have made the truth manifeſt unto me. For the <hi>Dutch Orator,</hi> remembered (as leaſtwiſe) that I ſpake nothing but touching his phraſe, for I do infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely eſteem his learning and judgement. Be pleaſed therefore to manage this petty ſecret according to your ordinary prudence: ſince I am ſo unfortunate, that I cannot utter one word, but it will ſtraight finde ſtrange Gloſſes and Commentaries, and that there be people ſo charitable, as to ſtir up warre againſt me, and create me enemies in all parts of the world. I have never received the Letter of <hi>Monſieur de</hi> — neither, did <hi>I</hi> need them to aſſure me of his love. I know that he is good and noble; wherefore relying hereupon, it ſufficeth me to underſtand that he is well; and it is not material to me, whether I learn this from him or from you. I forgot to tell you that J received from <hi>Monſieur the Duke of</hi> — many careſſes and favors; he hath uſed me like ſome great <hi>Perſonage,</hi> or mighty <hi>Signor;</hi> and J have been his <hi>Favorite</hi> the ſpace of four dayes.

But there is no need of doing bad offices about you, or to affright you with any <hi>Planet,</hi> whoſe <hi>malignity</hi> (I hope) you are able to correct. I paſſe it over therefore to tell you, that as long as <hi>Monſieur de</hi> — was here, I performed my part with wonderful aſſiduity, ſo that I was aſtoniſht at it my ſelfe. We have had long and particular diſcourſes upon all good ſubjects, and by conſequence, you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that you have not been forgotten. I never preach well, but when you are my <hi>Text.</hi> As <hi>I</hi> prize nothing more juſtly then your love, ſo <hi>I</hi> praiſe nothing more willingly then your vertue; and this ſubject pleaſeth me ſo well that <hi>I</hi> never want words, if <hi>I</hi> do not want <hi>Auditors.</hi> Yet <hi>I</hi> do not pretend to engage you hereby. To reckon you in the number of <hi>Illuſtrious</hi> men, is onely to leave you in your own ſeat; and to ſay that the <hi>Damſel</hi> will be your work, is to ſay, that <hi>Pallas</hi> will iſſue out of the head of <hi>Jove.</hi> She is at this time the ſweeteſt hope and expectation of honeſt leaſure; She is the deſire of the <hi>Cabinet,</hi> and will be the great <hi>labour</hi> of the <hi>French Muſes.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:120345:260"/>
and I hope to ſurpriſe you both together one day when you expect me not. But remember Sir, that even your purpoſe is a vow; and that you can have no ſuch diſpenſation, that can take away all ſcruple, if you have a render conſcience, and will believe ſome <hi>Divines</hi> (that I can name) concerning it.

But it is a thing worthy pitty, that a man ſhould receive conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual wrongs, and yet muſt not open his mouth to complain, but he ſhall be cenſured for a troubleſom and untoward fellow. I know the eager ſpirit of that man that ſpeaks ſo loud, when my intereſts are in agitation. I know he is carried with the hot vapors that exhale from that ſulphury vein, which (you ſay) lyeth about his heart. But you will confeſſe notwithſtanding, that the bottom of that heart is not bad. His laviſhneſs proceeds from a fair ſpring; and in acts of friendſhip an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation is better then drouth. I forgive the irritated zeal, inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate goodneſs, and impetuouſneſs of a man that cannot love with moderation. We muſt do him ſome right; and not hate his paſſion, though we approve it not; for my part, <hi>I</hi> do permit it, but not imploy it; and though he tells me, that he hath a fierce <hi>Satyre</hi> to come forth to kill our <hi>Meſſer,</hi> if he do not ſave himſelf in the little Cottage; I give him thanks for his good will, but I deſire him to deliver the <hi>Satyre</hi> into my hands, &amp; for this purpoſe only, that none might ſee it. You ſhal find in my packet ſome latine <hi>compoſitions</hi> that were ſent me, &amp; particularly, the latter teares of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> which have been commended unto you. In my judgement, (and I think you will ſubſcribe to it) he is too ſubtle, and ſhews too much punctuality in delineating a true <hi>Penitent.</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not ſpeak thus, nor its paſſions either, which are the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of nature, as ſubtleties are the wantons of <hi>Art. S. Peters</hi> ſorrow is admirably well expreſſed by <hi>Grotius;</hi> and theſe four verſes of his, which <hi>I</hi> remember, do weigh down the 400 that I have ſent you.</p>

Never did any man loſe the reliſh of all Books and Arts as I did; and hence you may gather that that which you ſent me, was very delicate, when it procured an appetite to a languiſhing man. You have ſtrangely altered me in a moment: my ſoul is touched to the quick; and you have made it ſo hungry after knowledge, that I have no mind to any thing but to your <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.</hi> If you will ſet up a <hi>Sect,</hi> I am ready to enrole my ſelf, at leaſt wiſe, I will ſubſcribe willingly to that franke Doctrine, which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains its liberty againſt the uſurpations of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> and is contented to acknowledge lawful power, but not to be ſlave to the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of one particular man. I ſpeak Sir, as I believe Doubtleſs your work will laſt, and to give you your full due, I muſt give it in your own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: ſo noble an act of the ſoul, is not the weakeſt argument we have of its immortality; and if any ſhall hereafter take in hand this ſubject, he will be beholding to you for this new argument, which your modeſty would not permit you to make uſe of. Certainly there were no reaſon nor colour, that the Off-ſpring ſhould be of a better condition then the <hi>Mother;</hi> and that thoſe productions which muſt encounter time, and conquer <hi>Fate,</hi> ſhould flow from a corruptible Principle.

                     <p>SIR, The <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> which you did me the honour to ſend me, is full of an infinite number of good things; and none can deny but your friend is both learned and judicious. Nevertheleſs I do not think that he will finde in that place whither he goeth, that approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he promiſeth to himſelf: I think that (for his ſpeaking <hi>Latine</hi> after the <hi>French</hi> manner) his meaning is better than his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. He is not alwayes ſo regular as <hi>I</hi> would deſire; and his words do ſometimes do wrong to his thoughts. True it is, that in theſe times we are very nice and delicate in the purity of expreſſions. VVe can brook no ſtile that is licentious, be it never ſo little; and whatſoever is no after the garbe of the Court is accounted barbarous. This is not that I am of the opinion of <hi>Monſieur do</hi> — that ſaid that the good mans judgement could never paſſe beyond the <hi>Gar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

VVhen he ſpake this, he forgot (ſure) that <hi>Monſ. de Pibrac, Monſide Montegne,</hi> and the <hi>Cardinal de Oſſat</hi> were <hi>Gaſcons;</hi> &amp; their ſolid judgements which are admired to this day over all <hi>Europe,</hi> do ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently refute that poor jeſt which paſſeth among ſome for excellent.
