            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>But <hi>Placandus</hi> tooke an other course, and from troubling him with any more questions, applyed the ordynary meanes of helpe in such cases, telling that they were men of Husbandrie and Cattle in the Kingdome of <hi>Nagania,</hi> and not Fishers; if then their supplyes could stand him in stead, or estates induce him to be one of the companie, hee might be sure neither to fayle of succour, nor complaine for want: and if my selfe seeme not lesse worthy then another, I will welcome thee, and vpon good deseruing, adde to thy welcome, a reward,</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2979:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
In the meane while, <hi>Coranus</hi> returning home, told his Daughter <hi>Deltona</hi> (for the Man was wiuelesse, and a stranger amongst them) of <hi>Montanus</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall with amplification of the circumstances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his shipwracke, which because it agreed to their fortune, shee was willing to heare, and hee readie to dilate.

                     <hi>Deltona</hi> could not but like her Fathers descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and allow of his opinion; yet was not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

because shee had not seene him; and wished to see him, that she might be satisfied: wondring how her desire tooke vpon it such a libertie, and halfe ashamed, least her Father might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue her minde distempred, but hee poore man, had a world of conceites to thinke of: for though hee looked on her with a kind of demurenesse, yet was it to ouerlooke her, least shee might haue discouered his sighing and teares; which to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent he cunningly led her foorth into a larger feeld of other conference; and so they remained with a reciprocall gladnesse not to be seene per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the shepherds daughters.</note> Daughter, who manifested she was begotten in a time of discretion by attyring her Head after the plainest fashion, and because no deuise obscured any imperfection, she might the better haue satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied a iudicious Censurer, had not the neere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of a prying looke marked the equalitie of her forehead tending to a little flatnesse.</p>
                  <p>The second was <hi>Enseria</hi> very ill placed so neere the formost; her attire seemed rather fantasticall then costly, and added this to suspition, that shee determined some strange course of life, because her beautie was adulterate.</p>
                  <p>The third was <hi>Hiale,</hi> pleasant <hi>Parastoes</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who might well haue brought liking with admiration on her side; but that a little smiling somewhat more then cheerefulnesse (as if mirth determined not to goe out of a generation) cal'd her modestie in question, and ouer-wrought the ornament of her face, the mouth.</p>
                  <p>The foorth was <hi>Niphe,</hi> from whom some quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a yeere before, Deaths Harrold summoned
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2979:12"/>
both Father and Mother; who amased the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with the appearance of liuely colours natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embelishing her cheekes, onely a dead eye ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused her of fullennesse: yet it might be former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance admitted the vnkinde ghuest sorrow, and limited commendation from ouer-reaching too farre.</p>
                  <p>Now marched <hi>Ladra</hi> Daughter to <hi>Argias,</hi> (to whom for his excellencie in Musick, they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a Pension) and was quickly seene: For hauing her Haire large, long, and of a singular amber; she ware it in a kinde of loosnesse; but so kindly, that it seemed an excellent carelesnesse: because shee was faire and vpright; yet kept pale Lippes, the full life of beautie aside.</p>
                  <p>Then presented her selfe <hi>Carista</hi> lusty <hi>Darpanos</hi> Daughter, who of purpose to shew varietie, or vnwilling to patrizare being a Maide merited a choyce commendation, had not a kind of sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie made her strangenesse reputed a littell pride, whereby a liuelinesse wanted to set foorth her worth to the best becomming.</p>
                  <p>The seuenth was <hi>Gralle Temellus</hi> onely Child, in whom the best cunning might be deceiued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, though now a fauourable countenance see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med dimmed with ouermuch Blood, yet impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to a kind of blushing, or allowing time the effect of moderation, without doubt she was an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable president of delight: so that <hi>Enuy</hi> added not this as an other fault, her speech was ouer loude.</p>

The eight was <hi>Ranata,</hi> whose cost questionlesse exceeded her fortune; in regard, that beside a well proportioned Body, the face could boast of no great Beautie, and wanted many parts to make it fauourable.</p>
                  <p>Now approched <hi>Tarina</hi> ritch <hi>Pleios</hi> Daughter, who made demonstration of her Fathers Wealth, by her owne statelinesse, yet in so good an order, that it seemed a prerogatiue, and had not a seucere Censor exprobated Nature for not allowing so sweete an aspect a perfect clearenesse, to all others it either appeared no defect, or appearing durst not so be counted, considering her owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance better marked, dispelled the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and made a new impression applaud all deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued worthinesse.</p>
                  <p>Next her came <hi>Carix</hi> blacke <hi>Alcastoes</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whose Haire enclining to a more then brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, added that bie name: yet was she full of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, which seemed attractiue as ioyned to a sober demeanor; so thou couldest not choose, but repine at Nature for vniting two contraries togeather, because the choysest louer was astonished, when that nakednesse (which modesty allowed to be seene) surpassed the rest for dellicacie and coloure.</p>
                  <p>The 11. was called the strange <hi>Duplana,</hi> who hauing no good part exactly lookt vpon, posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed yet euery part without exception; because her sweete cariage and dellicate behauiour strocke an

                  <p>The last of especiall note, was <hi>Sabetha,</hi> and in outward shew the least; but such a least, as shined like a sparcke of Pleasure: for the Eyes were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to enflame, the Countenance to enamoure, and her selfe so well fashioned to rauish: so that if a man would haue wished to be the beholder of a dellicate creature, the outward shew warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the inward persection confirmed her the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But to returne to <hi>Deltona,</hi> like a braue poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Diamonde triumphing ouer a border of prety ones, not altogether so well foiled,</q> shee warranted her Liuery to be sued out of the Court of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with all vnited a magnificent portlinesse; that <hi>Montanus</hi> imagined strange things, and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected himselfe surprized with the imagination, as though he durst haue sworne, shee deserued farre better then a simple Cottage: yet allowing as a Stranger the iudgement of so many, that tooke her for <hi>Coranus</hi> daughter, he quieted his thoughts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the businesse in hand disappointed Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had not the businesse disquieted him with Meditation. For hee was to salute, entertaine, welcome them, and to place them at the Table, which according to their olde Customes (least error might breed repining in wronging one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) hee orderly performed: but taking <hi>Deltona</hi> by the hand, as if Loue and Fortune had vsed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2979:14"/>
some conference about it, he made her his owne obiect.</p>
                  <p>By this time it was a world to see, how a little strangenesse can alter the whole companie: For the vpper Table consisting of the better, and elder sort weeried <hi>Placandus</hi> with many questions, and in a manner seemed emulous against the other for hauing <hi>Montanus</hi> amongst them: They againe reioyced in his presence, and were soone induced to allow him some preeminence, and truely howsoeuer he liked their fashions, or fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned himselfe to their liking, or was now setled in the aduantage of his owne amiable and portly <q>countenaunce, hee seemed, as if a good Husbande had preserued a stately Cedar in a conuenient Groue of smaller Trees,</q> whereby hee might boast of one surpassing all the rest: but doe not suppose hee was so generally regarded of them, as particularly noted by <hi>Deltona,</hi> who could not so moderate her neerenesse, but shee must eye him at the full, and when it seemed a pleasing thing to behold, she tooke the occasion of beholding him to be pleased: then she attempted to refraine, little knowing the restraint, made her next looking passionate: yet excused by the curtesie to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, she againe emboldned her selfe to looke, and to speake, both performed with such Loue-infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing sweetnesse, that <hi>Montanus</hi> protested maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie was betrayed to the meanest deiection. For how could so great beautie seeme kinde, but hee
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2979:14"/>
must be friendly? How could shee demaund, but he must answere? How could she view him, but he must review her? How could shee craue, but he must allow it? How could shee execute any thing, but he must be pleased? Insomuch that this first acquaintance warranted delight in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est manner, and soothed their desires to wish the continuance; yet those wishes were not ready to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admit any stedfastnesse, because <hi>Montanus</hi> was to forward the Dances, which for the first day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the pastimes, wherein no sooner setled he <q>himselfe to the measure with <hi>Deltona,</hi> but as if a soft <hi>Esterly</hi> winde had with a sudden strength stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the thicke leaued trees,</q> a certaine wispering of the company from mutuall eying them procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to liking; from liking to affecting; from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting to praysing; from praysing to wishing them some good; and debating wherein, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it by marriage: the rather because they had demeaned themselues so well before, and seemed now sutable in a Liuerie of preeminence: but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Coples presented occasion of new speach: yet <hi>Montanus</hi> stil in sight was stil remembred, as busied in ordring the next commers out to the Dances.</p>
                  <p>HEere then was deciphered sober <hi>Eugenio,</hi> who by the outward countance assured, his <note place="margin">The discrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the shepheards.</note> care was greater to encrease his wealth, then his pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Louely <hi>Miletus</hi> a man still practising of good as one, which knew no bad.</p>

Rich <hi>Polio,</hi> whose abilitie outcountenanced imperfections, which without doubt would else in pouertie not without scandall haue appeared, besides hee published this errour, that counting Vertue but the passage of breath, hee esteemed Money before a Friend.</p>
                  <p>Rude <hi>Sciscus,</hi> who in an ill accomplished pride, shewed rather a willingnesse to the vice, then was fashioned to any Grace or good Manner.</p>
                  <p>Vnfortunate <hi>Pleistos,</hi> whose Fancie was euer haunted with a counter-changeable crossenesse, as a man playing with his Shadow running from that, which followed him, and prosecuting, what seemed to fly from him.</p>

                  <p>Stubborne <hi>Bustosa</hi> who had no good qualitie, but plainenesse.</p>

                  <p>Besides that did not dance, <hi>Enuious Franio,</hi> who was not onely ill in himselfe, but compassed to make all others like himselfe.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2979:16"/>
was excellent; or ielious, that any other should watch <hi>Deltona</hi> with the like regard; or emulous to hazzard his credit by being ouer-mastered, hee gallantly set forward; and was indeede so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that while the rest repined at Fortune to suffer a Stranger to glory in their disgrace, he had time to tell her, that her matchlesse beauty was attractiue, and had added wings to his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: with that shee gaue him the Garland to weare, and forgaue him a kisse which hee stole: Now?

                  <p>Thus did a second meeting encrease more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and liking.

and looked too; by which he supposed shee bade him to remember himselfe, as if the secret of his desaster had been discouered: In this feruencie he stepped foorth vncalled, neuer seeming angry till now; not to be feared, till hee was angry, and then were all commers ouer-throwne: what he yet did, proceeded rather from a necessary ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, then a vaine ostentation, vnlesse it were in the contention with <hi>Franio,</hi> whom for ill lookes and base manner of Play, valour scorned, so that adding a little violence to disdaine, the fall brake his arme; no man so sorry for his hurt, as glad of <hi>Montanus</hi> estimation which by a generall Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, and theyeelding vp the Prizes, gaue him te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of regard.</p>
                  <p>NOw the Custome shadowed the secrets of passion, if perhaps there happened a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <note place="margin">The third meeting of Montanus and Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tona.</note> liking of Parties: For it was an honour to the preuailer, if he bestowed the Prize (which was a Watchet Scarffe of curl'd Cypers, embrodered ouer with Starres of gold) on any worthy subiect: Whereupon <hi>Montanus</hi> with a wanton pleasantnesse, much gracing his demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, presented the same to <hi>Deltona;</hi> who tooke it, but in such a manner, that shee knewe not, whether the gift, or the handsomnesse in the deliuerie pleased more, besides: her sudden blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matched to contraries together, feare &amp; glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2979:17"/>
nothing was impossible, it somewhat setled him in the hope of a new meeting: at last he began a strict examination, why his minde should so run on <hi>Deltona;</hi> his sleepes in broken dreames of <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tona;</hi> his dreames, that hee meeteth <hi>Deltona?</hi> his waking fancie recounting the worth of <hi>Deltona;</hi> stedfastly supposing a shepheards daughter could not be <hi>Deltona?</hi> But the more hee meditated, the sooner he receiued a foile, for lacke of resolution, so that by this time the want of the thing longed for was not so great, as the meanes to obtaine it daungerous: his feare, mistrusting the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses hee meant to set on worke, and his desire importuning some satisfaction: this willed him to repayre to solitarinesse, where hee quickly ranne ouer the rugged Fieldes of disquiet; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time condemning fondnesse and folly for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorting together, then exclaming on his owne weakenesse, for yeelding to such degenerate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions: other-while hee met with considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that man was subiect to many inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; <q>anon he encountered with patience, a strange vertue to pull on heauier burdens;</q> sometime hee vp brayded his peuishnesse for his submission, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Battle with <hi>Leonidas;</hi> and by &amp; by, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested to abiure both the place and the companie: But this seeming a counterfeit stoutnesse (as if hee had offended by such imagination) set him foorth to the recourse of his Friendes; but alas, their Welcome prooued like a trayterous Banquet,

wherein mischiefe counterfeiteth to betray a man, and sounded in his eares, they were the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Reposednesse; whereupon hee practised againe to be alone, had not so many by wayes of Fancie confounded him, that hee durst not abide the fearefulnesse of being alone. Thus euery thing framed the vnframing of his health, and brought him at last to the vnkind acquaintance of a Feuer, whereby he wanted orderly rest, and naturall diet, the soule bearing the body company in tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting many changeable inflictings, as it had yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a sence-weakning violence; sometime leaning the head against a firmenesse, as if he meant to settle his Braine: otherwile the Armes crossed <q>with strength, resembled two strong Barres,</q> which bound in the Heart from flying out of her inclosure: Sometimes his Feete stood him in stead to pace out his griefe: anone a Palle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Glad was she of this: glad was hee of her gladnesse: the one allowing any thing, might adde life to her desires: the other, disalow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euery thing, might disparage her worth: yet the next day he brought her along, not desisting from a milde passage of speach tending to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, by the way.</p>
                  <p>TO this place (O happy Fortune, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted <note place="margin">Montanus commeth to Marpesias Caue, and findeth Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tona.</note> him to this place) did <hi>Montanus</hi> sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle her out: for as the working of his spirits draue him to pace out his fancie in the fields, hee saw <hi>Coranus</hi> and <hi>Deltona</hi> passe the Groue toward the Caue; and knowing the limitation of his aboade would be quickly measured: hee very couertly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Sanctuarie, as soone as <hi>Coranus</hi> had yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her the freedome of being alone, and in a kind of distemperature betwixt feare and gladnesse ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted into the roome of <hi>Statuas,</hi> where <hi>Deltona</hi> was off ciously disposing her affaires. But when shee saw her Deuotion intercepted, and <hi>Montanus</hi> so
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2979:31"/>
strangely audacious, shee neither knew what to thinke, or to say: for her thoughts were at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance betweene Desire and mistrust, and her speach was stopped with amazement; so that shee almost fainted for feare, had not feare in an other nature, least shee might be surprised added life to her fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. On the other side, when <hi>Montanus</hi> saw the errour of his rashnesse, the first liuelinesse was quite rebated; and the conceit at her distempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, made him checke his folly for being no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aduised; at last finding ouer-shamefastnesse to be more childish then man-like, and that a retreat would rather shew a demissnesse, then audacitie a fault, he thus framed his treatise of pacification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>My most deare, and dearer then my dearest life; Fortune euer maleuolent vnto mee, hath now taken pitty vpon mee, and weary of her tyranny, brought mee to this place of delight: By Loues chiefe happinesse, I therefore pray thee, make my Hopes legitimate, and my worthily bestowed Affection, the fortunate child of contentment; least you ouerpasse the glory of a strange conquest, which may adde to thy desert, what the greatest thoughts can imagine, and I repent too late for submitting Princely maiestie to the censure of a Shepheards Daughter.</q> Till this, her amazednesse at the accident rather tollerated, then admitted, what was done: but hearing him name a tytle of that consequence, a new ioy quickly reuiued her spirits: like a friend in ambush reuiewing a priuate

Combat, and seeing some dangerous inequalitie <q>rusheth out either to deuide the contention, or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the weaker side; this made her thankfull to the Nimphs,</q> as if her Orizons had wrought the propitiation, and accepting it for answer from the Oracle, (as if she had knowne before he had taken this counterfeite vpon him) shee replyed.</p>
                  <p>Little needed <hi>Montanus,</hi> (for in that title my <q>liking consented to <hi>Montanus)</hi> to haue boasted of Genealogies, or names of Dignitie: so that (to be plaine,) I was euer carryed with the streame of Fancie; yet durst I not betray my forwardnesse to the violence of Passion, vntill I was assured of her respect to vertue, (to whom, seeing my vowes haue specially combined mee) be thou vertuous, and be <hi>Montanus,</hi> or Prince, or what thou wilt; and I shall then loue thee for vertues sake. What call you Vertue,</q> answered he, by <hi>Marpesias</hi> Altar? By the sacred Nimphs, by these starlike Eyes, (which I will charme with my kisses) I meane truth, fayth, constancie, mariage, and what soeuer <hi>Deltona</hi> would, that I meane: But thinke you I can liue in this fire vnconsumed, and see this excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie without desiring? What should you desire? (replyed shee:) I hope you will not your selfe destroy your selfe; or affecting my estate, seeke to diminish my wealth: for if you like me for good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse sake, will you attempt to bereaue me of that goodnesse, whereby you would like no more?

                  <p>This <hi>Egerius</hi> was sonne of a Stranger named <hi>Bertosas,</hi> dwelling in the Citty, whom those at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractiue Vertues, which grace Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, did so accompany, that all men affoorded him their loue and liking; and the <hi>Duke</hi> applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Sonnes choyce.

Sometimes with more quicknesse then good speed, running ouer all the course of former occurrents, with a certaine heart-breaking at his Brothers exile; but surfetting on that dish, hee loathed the dyet, and choaked himselfe with the delight of principalitie; next hee remembred the contract, whereof the very terrour made him abashed to thinke, in what madnesse it was ratified then, and with what remorce repented now: anon hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited how his subiects were affected, if either the murther of his children should continue, or the breach of such inhumane couenants be attempted; afterward hee reasoned, why <hi>Arcabella</hi> importuned this trauell; and last of all, whether the sentence should be reputed Canonicall: Butthe feare of that diffidence extinguished at the first puffe the flame, and yet gaue light to goe forward in the other path; as if there were as much necessitie to propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate <hi>Apollos</hi> displeasure, as to determine his owne

                  <p>Thus prooued this Voyage prosperous at Sea, and was not altogeather ominous at Land, because <hi>Scalitorax</hi> King of <hi>Phocis</hi> truly aduertised of the Emperours comming, and the cause, found it a matter of small suspition, and therefore made an honourable Welcome, a forward Spring of his owne greatnesse, and a very life of <hi>Mengrelius</hi> hope: But when his brother <hi>Misocrapus</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> Priest had returned answere, hee would attend the Emperour at <hi>Delphos,</hi> not doubting of auspicious successe, hee seemed rauished with gladnesse; and in that poynt of extremitie onely <q>affoorded occasion of suspition, as when we see a sodaine Storme immediatly succeed a glorious Heate:</q> yet durst no man make such interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because the Art of Deuining was peculiar to the Priestes.

THis <hi>Delphos</hi> had the report of others illustred, and the rarenesse of it selfe made admirable: <note place="margin">The descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos.</note> in respect the place was supported by the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>florishing <hi>Pernassus,</hi> which seemed glad to be the foundation of the Building; but ten times glad, that it resembled some Bulwarke to secure a tresu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; and yet it appeared more beholding to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <q>then Art: For the cragginsse of the Hill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled a very net of Rockes,</q> as if the Stone and Earth were layde countercompony togeather: next the passable wayes were so many, and hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to crosse turnings meeting one another, that it made a confused Laborinth. Lastly, the entries into mighty Caues, represented so many Dores of the house of Darknesse; and by the many changes of Lightnings, Thunders, casting vp of Stones, Sulphur, flashings, filthy stenches, and suffocating Dampes, seemed the very entries of Hell; which <hi>Xerxes</hi> made proofe of by loosing foure thousand men in going about ro robbe the Treasure, and <hi>Brennus</hi> Duke of <hi>Gallia</hi> experimented, when hee prosecuted the like theft: Contrariwise, all peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working gentlenesse, and sence-pleasing sweetnes welcommed the necessarie commers, and liberall Benefactors.</p>
                  <p>On the topp of this Mountaine was the Oracle erected; a place beautified with the cost of Kings, &amp; venerated by the accesse of chiefest Monarches: for therein none might enter, but especiall Priests, religious Princes, and strange Embassadours.

Concerning the Monument it selfe, Fame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it a Temple vnmatchable; and Time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed it the Pallace of <hi>Apollo,</hi> allowed both for an honorable dwelling, and a consecrated Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie: the substaunce whereof it was compounded, made shew of a costly Marble, and the forme it retayned, seemed a spatious Goodlinesse, staying the eyes of the beholders with varietie of obiect; wherein the Workemen had so played their partes, as if indeed they had determined to make their memories immortall. For <hi>Agamedes</hi> and <hi>Trophonius</hi> the supposed Attificers, are for this cause made famous: It was well Leaded on the top, strongly bard with Iron, vnusually windo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed with Iaspar, mightily vnderpropt with Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, substancially roofed with Cedar, surely lockt to keepe their Treasure, and cunningly enclosed for obscuring their Secrets: the inside allowing more daintinesse, then the outside goodlinesse; and both vnited to be a scence-rauishing Miracle: and the trouble to others arose from conceite, rather how it was finished, then in the labour to them, which concluded it. Round about were Trees planted, in which did alwaies Oyle burne; Houses established to lodge the companie, and Vestries appoynted for the ornaments of the Sacrifice. At the Doore stoode an Idoll, which they did kisse: a hollow Truncke, in which they did offer, and a Lauatorie to wash in. Within hunge a siluer Bell to be rung, stoode a perfumed

                  <p>The Priestes were the first which apparrelled themselues, opened the doores, sweetned the roomes, bedecked the Tables, brought out the Rellicks, hung the walles, furnished the pillars, spread abroad costly Carpets, set out their Iewels, trimmed the cup-boards, and entertained the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors. After them other Officers and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants were to celebrate a tryumph; and last of all, the parties approached to receiue their answeres, which were sometimes diffused &amp; obscure; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ambiguous or <hi>Amphibologies;</hi> sometime briefe and very peremptorie; sometime true, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and enlarged.</p>
                  <p>Now is the <hi>Emperor</hi> magnificently entreated, and orderly instructed; whereupon hee lodgeth his Retinew, watcheth his Nights, shaueth his haire, apparrelleth his body, approacheth the Temple, washeth his hands, offereth his presents, kisseth the Idole, knolleth the Bell, sturreth the Incense, alloweth the Orizons, beginneth his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, standeth his Circles, and marketh the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuration; which began with terrors and darknesse, vntill two burning Tapers suddenly flaming by the naked side of the Image, discouered the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Chappell, and made him attentiue to heare the vnliuing massinesse divuldge the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Gods.

whether the Common-wealth should be disorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: but the fearefull <hi>Mengrelius</hi> made his accesse to the Court, an astonishment to his Nobles, and a heauie welcome to <hi>Arcabella;</hi> they sorrowing his answere was frownes: and she trembling his salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was a command out of presence, who accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to no other disposition then obedience: displeasingly dutifull accorded to the hard doome, and louingly impatient effected his will.</p>
                  <p>But vnkindnesse had not thus her period: For <hi>Mengrelius</hi> findnig the Oracle to threaten his destruction, in the Beleefe grewe so impatient, that the promises of comfort, and sweetnesse of counsell seemed ircksome, scarse abiding to heare of redresse, and absolutely denying to discouer the reason: resembling him, whom crueltie bereaued <q>of his principall member the tongue, because hee had nothing to talke of but wofull lookes, nor any thing to discouer,</q> but soone mooued displeasure, which astonished the beholders, who yet desisted not to pacifie his trouble, and beguile his passion: but he despighted to see any inclination to delight, and perceiuing his actions were so generally mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, retiered himselfe, and was only humorons in the worst part of melancholy: at last the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie draue him cleane out of doores, and made him eccho in the fields, what he durst not wisper in the Pallace.</p>

                  <p>In this mood he hasted toward the Pallace, but the instant violence of his Resolution was thus stangely rebated: Eare the tract of the groue had fully conduced him to the end, a sodden storme intercepted further hastinesse, and compelled his retreat to a place of shellter: now; whether the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the tempest effectuated drowsinesse; or his spirites weried with meditation desired rest: or the very braine dryed with sorrow shruncke vp the stringes of his eyeliddes; or him selfe was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to this course to ouerpasse his feare; he quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <q>fell a sleepe, had not his sleepe the more disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted him, like a man reparing a ruinous house,</q> and pulling downe aparte haleth also the whole to his greater charge: For a formidable dreame thus surprised his repose.

                  <p>The King <hi>Zalby</hi> was much mooued at this, but <hi>Rugio</hi> more; as suspecting a purposed neglect of dutie: yet perceiuing a setled countenance, and vndeuided speeches to conclude the rebuke, they knew not how to enterpret it; considering the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie reputed an inferiour amongst them; at last they called <hi>Coranus,</hi> who more fearefull to oppose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Duke, then firme in expectation of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus,</hi> told them of his shipwracke at Sea; <hi>Placan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> entertainement; his loue to <hi>Deltona,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract at the Caue, and in a sparing manner, how he promised her to discouer a further secret: which wrought thus much, that the King fore-saw there might be cause of affliction; and he seemed likely to be of better account, by which reason the Duke was pacified, and <hi>Montanus</hi> moderated his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse: but who had seene <hi>Egerius</hi> behold him in this extasie pleading for <hi>Deltona,</hi> would haue sworne he had beene contemplating some Prode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie: presently <hi>Philano</hi> aduaunced himselfe, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Egerius</hi> what troubled him, bade him withall tell his opinion of <hi>Montanus.</hi> Truely (sayd <hi>Ege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius)</hi> accidents of admiration chance in the world, and men are subiect to high direction, so that it must needs fall out, that hee hath beene ouer-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with extremitie, and is sure of better desert then the outward habite or appearance, which hee the rather allowed, because by his owne example

But the Officers loth to make too tyrannous a spoyle,

sounded the rechaite, so the rest at randome were assured of more rest; yet rested not the Duke, till he conducted the King in to a gallant Arbour, so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly handled, that a man might haue said the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiser determined to grace the walkes of the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace with a worke of specialtie, and set foorth his owne praises, as if he were by it to commend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; for who could but aske his name to know him, and extoll him once knowne.</p>
                  <p>Heere was a roiall Banquet prepared, and an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time of Counsell (sorting with the conuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the place) concluded, that <hi>Bertosus</hi> should end the Storie of <hi>Mengrelius;</hi> who as willing to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdened of hir owne feares, as they seemed to be acquainted with others fortune, sent for <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> to come within hearing, and thus began.</p>

But wee kept a steady passage to our Harbour, and had cause of comfort, when the trauell of foure dayes brought vs within the sight of the Iland: Yet looke how a sparke of Fire euen at the very present of his taking leaue of the heate giueth the <q>greater light; so wee gaue a sodaine shoot of ioy, with a Swanlike dittie, at the instant of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:</q> For on a sodaine, a North-west winde whirled the Barke about, and though the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners endeuored the contrary, wee as quickly lost, as enioyed the former delight: Then followed a Storme, which with continuance vnited to the Winde, raised a dangerous Tempest: last of all, approached a second Darknesse, wherein the night drew her Curtaines to hide vs from the face of Heauen, had not the contention in those vpper Regions giuen vs more light, then wee wished, because bringing terrour with the Thunder, wee neither durst behold either Earth, or Heauen. On the other side, the Sea hearing the bigg voyce of the Windes, awaked her sluggishnesse, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2979:81"/>
perceiuing such variance betwixt the Fire &amp; Aire for superioritie, would not imbace her selfe, but thought to make her greatnesse appeare, as well as they; and so swelled beyond measure, growing to that rage, that wee thought it better to be subiect to Men, then implacable Waues.</p>
                  <p>This continued a whole day and night, and the continuance wroughteffect to put vs in minde of our frailtie, and to make preperation for another dwelling, because the Barcke vnable to house vs, was willing to dislodge vs; and we likewise grew weary of being such Tenants, especially my poore Brother and I, who seemed dying, before death; and ten times dying, to behold the sweete Infants cling to vs for succour, who were not able to helpe our selues: Yet at last Nature preuayling against Wilfulnesse, wee determined to tarry for, rather then to runne to so bad a friend as Death, and therefore agreed to striue with Redresse, if wee could, and to tie the Children to our backes, concluding to change their Names what euer chaunced; and withall, changed our Places, setling our selues neere to some strong Planckes, and Chestes: So, by that time our <hi>Genius</hi> assured the splitting of the Shippe, I was safe in this vnsafetie on a seasoned Truncke of Firre, and my Brother on a spare Mast; both which, floted for a while <q>neere the dismembred Barke, like silly Birdes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering about their Mother entrapped in a Nette,</q> and leaue her not, till the Fawkner assure, hee is the

What should I say (most migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie King) the feare was more then the danger; and yet may the greatest scorner of Perils, confesse the danger exceeded any meanes, which humaine pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecie had to auoyde it, considering our burdens, and combersome company, which did rather aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then diminish our griefe. For alas, to be in hassard of drowning amidst the cruell Billowes, desperat of succour, on vnfirme seates, and with infant Princes tyed to our backes, who can but thinke wee had sorrow sufficient, and suppose our heauinesse a wonderfull temptation: At length we seemed cheared with a life cast in a new mold by perceiuing faire weather approching, resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling <q>a condemned person meditating with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and sadly casting his lookes on the ground, as not daring to lift them vp to heauen,</q> till the sound of a Pardon infuseth strength and courage into his decayed soule: whereupon wee setled vp our selues, and began to appease the Children, who as if they meant to finde fault with Fortunes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courtesie, exclaymed on her vnkindnesse by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their owne innocencie; which whether it were with the inforcement penetrable, or that the Gods meant to shew their power in contrarieties (I dare not verdict) but presently to our amaze, &amp; their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification, a gallant calme succeeded, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward face of heauen suffered her blacknes to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped away, whereby it appeared like the milde mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the earth; so that it was my good happe

to driue vnder the Walles of <hi>Fortona,</hi> where a Fisher stood drying his Nettes, whom as I learnt afterwad, was the old <hi>Piscaro;</hi> and as I had cause to acknowledge, was the honest <hi>Piscaro:</hi> For see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some strange thing floting a farre off; hee wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to helpe, if hee could; and graciously helped when hee could: So my safetie increased with his comfort; in which loth to appeare defectiue, hee had me presenty to his House, confirming his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie by his good Workes.</p>
                  <p>NOw when hee presumed on my strength, hee questioned with mee about my Shipwracke; <note place="margin">Bertosussuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp by Piscarro &amp; nameth Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoboro Ege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</note> and to be plaine, I made a round excuse, as though <hi>Cleonidas</hi> had set fire on my poore dwelling in <hi>Persia,</hi> and caried mee Prisoner to his <hi>Iland,</hi> till a tempest deuided vs, and sent mee floting, as hee found.

This was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse I made, and with this excuse was my peace made; so that I remayned with him a while ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willing to please, then to complaine of my owne discontentment: but when he found my endeuours consorting to his disposition, as though I ment to checke ingratitude, he professed a further

liking, and very suddenly imparted his wealth vnto me: to be breife with him I continued some fiue yeeres not forgetting the bringing vp of my sonne, who seemed of that forwardnesse (as quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learning and gracing whatsoeuer he learnt) that my contentment sprang from his expectation: but this manner of life did not long last, because <hi>Pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carro,</hi> lasted not himselfe, as summoned to a stricter tryall by the irreuocable sentence of death: and preparing for another world made an oueraffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on adept me his heyre in this world, &amp; left a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be subiect vnto their mallice, that saw me possessed of his wealth, which though it amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to no great matter, yet I compassed the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling I now enioy, and was able to bring vp <hi>Egerius,</hi> as you all can partly witnesse: But seeing the winges of time haue thus spread out themselues, and the booke of heauenly reuolutions turneth to this leafe, let not vs degenerat with dulnesse or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, but take out a new lesson, and with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence acknowledge him the <hi>Emperor Mengrelius</hi> Sonne, and remember his true name to be <hi>Ptincely Trezoboro:</hi> For this is he, whom <hi>Gellida</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthum</hi> gaue me such charge of.</p>
                  <p>But say <hi>Coranus</hi> (quoth King <hi>Zalby)</hi> after <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tosus</hi> was thus vnkindly seperated from you, what fauour found you amongst the tossing surges?

                     <hi>MOntanus</hi> went directly to his father <hi>Placandus,</hi> ouer whom seuerall feares and <note place="margin">Montanus commeth to Placandus: his father &amp; prepareth himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Triumph.</note> sorrowes for the murder of <hi>Franio,</hi> and the dissipation of his friendes had an vntoward gouernment: but it was quickly deposed by the returne of <hi>Montanus,</hi> who by this time was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commed, as if a traueler hauing left a louing wife <q>in the seuerall mistrustes of a dangerous vioage paste hope of returning presented himselfe by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle vnto her: which occationed some ceremony of kindnesse,</q> as well to strengthen the opinion of <hi>Placandus</hi> toward him, as to satisfie his curiosity, which neuer left ouer burdning him with questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Wherupon he tould the old man of the <hi>Dukes</hi> stealing <hi>Deltona,</hi> her scorne and <hi>Franios</hi> trechery: he tould the old man, <hi>Coranus</hi> had found a brother, himselfe was entertained with <hi>Bertosus,</hi> and what had chanced concerning <hi>Egerius:</hi> he tould the old man <hi>Mengrelius</hi> story, king <hi>Zalbys</hi> comming to the Court, and <hi>Deltonas</hi> with her brothers discouery: he tould the old man the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement, which followed, the embassage concluded on, and the triumph proclamed, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was resolued to goe; which when <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candus</hi> rather wondred at, then impugned, hee told the old Man of his misfortunes, the fight

with <hi>Cleonidas,</hi> and his right to the kingdome of <hi>Armenia:</hi> To be breefe he tould the old man he was the Prince <hi>Anzitemus,</hi> of his contract at <hi>Mengrelius</hi> Caue, and how <hi>Deltona</hi> remained irremoueable, and vnaltred: of which though the strangnesse slacked his beleefe, yet was the truth so modestly vrged, &amp; the likelyhood of his spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches concurred with such smothnesse, that <hi>Placan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> reioyced in the hope to find it so, and with a gladsome contraryetie seemed officious vnto him, as if he knew it was so: But when the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning rumored the like circumstances, he then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued all the partes of loue and secrecy, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his directions made ready Mony of his Cattell, moueables and such like he possessed, with which <hi>Montanus</hi> furnished him selfe, as conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently as he could, and at the time appoynted came into the field with a Caparison curiously embost with watchet silke and gold counterchangeably layed vpon the same coulour <hi>Persian</hi> stuffe: his deuise a lawrell florishing vnder a tempestuous Element, the Mote: <hi>Salua tamen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus with a seemely Trot he paced to the Tilt, <note place="margin">Montanus commeth to the Triumph unknowne.</note> as if he determined to grace their expectation with a thing of some rarenesse: For the Horse commaunded manifested a scorne of wantonnesse by a stately sobrietie; and he commaunding, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged the beast without any wrested mouinges or enforced restraintes: nor was the <hi>Duke</hi> much discontented with his approach (his courage en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2979:91"/>
it a pollecie of Honour to adde more fethers to the Wings of Fame, because he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy made tryall of as good men at armes as any in <hi>Asia:</hi> yet very loth, that mischance should make a mixture with that dayes glory, he shifted his weary Horse, and tooke him to an old Bay, which rather (as if time had altered the coulour) seemed a perfect Chesse-nut, and so supplyed the roome againe, attending the sommons of victory.</p>
                  <p>But when the Ladyes were made acquainted with the noueltie, strange was their desier to know him, strange was their griefe, that none could satisfie their desier: As for the peerlesse <hi>Brizaca,</hi> though she could haue wished him <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus;</hi> and withall, remembred the good of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus:</hi> yet not able to thinke, what treasurie in a place vnknowne, had opened her doores, she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted from supposing him <hi>Montanus:</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because her minde had runne on <hi>Montanus,</hi> or that the nature of well wishing extendeth to the weaker side; she once againe allowed him <hi>Montanus;</hi> and praied accordingly for the same successe, as if it had beene to <hi>Montanus;</hi> but the Trumpets sound gaue warning to put her other sences in practise; and so the first course began, which passed both with liking to the beholders, and astonishment to <hi>Rugio,</hi> because they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a sweeter cleannesse in the diuision, and hee felt a quicker strength in his deliuery: yet knowing
<q>
                        <pb n="178" facs="tcp:2979:92"/>
conceit was a weakning of courage, and the least aduantage,</q>descried a step to Conquest, hee made ready againe, and so fiue times togeather with sufficient equality concluded, and might surely haue triumphed without impeachment, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the deeds of Armes, with whose applause he had filled all mens cares the day before: but that the Saddle at the sixt encounter scorned the weakenesse of his Strappes, and vnworthily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdened it selfe of so worthy a Master; who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med somewhat perplexed to be so disappoynted, yet was pacefied in the displeasure, when the rest receiued the same payment.</p>
                  <p>In this manner was Glory satisfied to see the Vertue of this new Knight accompanied with good successe, and so the Iudges with semblant <q>suffrages, yeelded the honour of the triumph vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: But hee vtterly disclaymed to assume it,</q> considering the <hi>Duke</hi> had continued longest in the Field, and hee came like an Enemie in <hi>ambus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado,</hi> espying the best aduantage for his sallying foorth. To this <hi>Rugio</hi> opposed, as much pleased with his respect, as opinion of the rest: especially considering his hopes toward <hi>Brizaca</hi> were fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and therefore led him vp in great royalty to receiue the Prize: where the admirable Princesse, accompanied with many worthy Lapyes expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to whose portion Fortune would allot it: But when a full interuiew had taken away the vaile of doubtfulnesse, it was no kind entertainement,

but a sence rauishing ioy published him <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> wherein shee might haue passed the limits of moderation, if <hi>Trezoboro</hi> had not sommoned her to put her other graces in practise. Now when <hi>Montanus</hi> found him selfe the cause of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused silence, and turmoyle, hee thought it high time to pollish the rough way, and lead them to a plaine Field of his knowledge; whereupon hee <q>vsed this preamble. Let not (great Princes) too suddaine a censure passe vpon my presumption or negligence; but rather be incensed against Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and my owne Misfortunes, if respect haue not passed with her properties: But because you haue already participated with the discouery of this peerelesse Princesse, and yet still continue as a longing and louing Mother for the returne of an other Sonne, affoord mee a litle patience, and I will fill vp the measure of your hopes:</q>Yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Iourney I vndertake is tedious, and this dayes trauell importuneth repose, I will dispence awhile with the time, and procrastinate your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires till to morrowes conueniencie: But very quickly is the Sunne infeoffed with the nights in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and <hi>Trezoboro</hi> in his sisters hehalfe (stomaching the delay, hee thought <hi>Montanus</hi> made) challenged his honourable Promise, and accompanied him to King <hi>Zalby,</hi> the Duke, and rest of the Princes; who by this, furnished a roome of State, wherein the chiefest things worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard was strange expectation: So that after <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaca</hi>

                     <hi>Talmiranda</hi> Queene of <hi>Assiria;</hi> with whom hee spent the dayes of his yeares, and the yeares of his glory, glorying so much the more, because Nature imparted her Bountie in many particulers, and Time made the vpshot with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable issue: For his Sonnes, <hi>Artabazes</hi> and <hi>Olmus</hi> shewed in their bringing vp great hope, and in their Fathers life Honourable gouernment. But the aged <hi>Armenus</hi> must satisfie his debt to the whole worlds creditor, &amp; leaue them in the world like Waxe wrought with a warme hand ready for any impression.

steeliest disposition: But when by many particulars tending to a perfect establishment, they found their peace and plentie to florish, then were they violently carryed with zeale, duty, and reuerence: and truly (most mighty Princes) how euer some enuious hand did afterward cast poyson into his vertuous Spring, hee questionlesse layed a sure foundation, as your selues (if you will affoord mee a little patience) may witnesse.</p>
                  <p>For the first thing he vndertooke, was the peop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a mighty Citty in the hart of his Realme, and erecting a sumptuous Pallace in the middest of the Towne; that a reseptacle of all sorts, whom controuersies compelled to tryall of Lawes, this ordained to especiall persons, whom honour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to follow the Court. The Buildings not yet so much beautified with externall curiousnesse, as firme statelinesse: and the Pallace an inuention of glory and eternity: as hauing sure walles, well proportioned largnesse, stately lightes, easy Staires, great Entries, Princely Galleryes, conuenient Lodginges, wide and magnificent gates, aparted Offices, holsome walkes, sweete Gardens, and dellicate Nurseries: But what was this to the scituation &amp; polliticke aduancement, the ground worke it selfe mounted two Furlonges higher then the other buildinges, and the metation fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with the circuit of a Thousand yardes, all contained within the deepenesse of a double Moat to which industry of man had drawne vp the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:2979:94"/>
of many springes, and the circomference of a triple Wall: yet did a stealing hill in such soft vprising direct thee, that what with the brauery of the Marbell paued streetes, and the comlinesse of the euen built houses waling foure great wayes of two hundred foot in breadth, eight hundred yardes in length from the Cittie gate to the first Pallace wall, thou wouldest haue been delighted in the iorny, and wondred with what pleasure thou hadst attained to such height: thus was it stronge to with stand insurrection, and in the midest for the better commaund of the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and easier prouision of the Pallace: like the heart enuiorned with the body, and the nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher of life to all the members, they flourishing by the strength of it, and that prospering by the good order of them: Thus was it princely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suscitate regarde, because the state of Maiestie may not be confounded with communitie, but retaine speciall reuerence. Thus was it named <hi>Armamiranda</hi> that the people in remembring their well affected <hi>Prince</hi> might conceiue he forgot not his much deseruing parentes.</p>
                  <p>The next matter of import was to vnuaile the grosenesse of errors, and to reduce the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to vniformitie, which consisting in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance of vertue and men louing vertue for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues sake, selected such, whose integritie of life, and prudent directions warranted their worth for any purpose, as for follie either of her selfe loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,

or bewtiched with impietie abhominable, she was altogeather banished: the person whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer reiected for the imperfection, and the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection imputed rather to scorne of discipline, then naturall defect. This made the good goe forward in a well troden path, and the bad desist from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coustomed ill life, to which they were as it were directed, by reason so great a king made himselfe exemplary by his owne vprightnesse in iudgment, trueth of word, reposednesse of speech, cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of aspect, secrecie of businesse imparted, tolleration of inconueniences, resolution of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises, heroyicke proceedinges in matters of Armes, constancie in affliction, and at all times reuerence towrad the Gods.</p>
                  <p>The officers of his house were such, whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour sollicited Honour to remember their worth, or vertue beautified, that Honour before collated to them: yet was no man trusted to the libertie of his owne will, but receiued these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, to accknowledge the dignitie of a kinges person, to maintaine the secretes of state and Court, to perpetrate no fact incurring the crime of Maiesty, to detract no time nor occasion, which might set foorth the honour of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to admit no vnworthy person, as an officer in Court, to hinder no mans aduancement, that had merited his place, and to depraue, nor depriue no complainant, till his cause were iudicially heard.</p>

His prouidence appoynted a Hundred Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as Presidents of Prouinces dispersed through the Empire; to whom he committed Causes of incombrances, and Petitions of the people; not yet withdrawing him selfe from Controuersies of importance, nor forbidding to speake, whom In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries enforced; so that the Proude and Mighty were depressed, the Weake and Innocent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and the Worthily regarded, confirmed.</p>
                  <p>The Priestes had charge to watch late, to rise early, to be spare of Diet, sober in speaking, patient in suffering, holy in conuersation, seruent in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Sacrifice, impartiall in reprehention, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted with priuate malice, no hoorders of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, administers of wants, and keepers of their owne houses.</p>
                  <p>The Noble-men reziant in their Countries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued these instructions, To haue their Houses stored with seruiceable Attendants, such as should neither be rash, quarrellers, lyers, blasphemers, gluttonous, gamesters, lecherous, or infamed: All which might be easily auoyded, or quickly preuented, if they themselues were milde, honest, sober, silent, patient, familiar, and deuoute: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther murmuring at the haunts of Brothers, Vncles; Coosins, and all other of their kin; nor denying to succour the necessities of poore Allies; or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the wantes of crauing Strangers; whose en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced aduersitie deserued compassion.</p>

                  <p>The Marchant was made acquainted to trauell abroad, to obserue his Martes, to learne nauigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to abstaine from curiosity, to apply himselfe to the place of his Trade, to exchange his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, to be certaine of his admittance, and to make difference in the choise of his Marchandise, according to the variety of Countries, each af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording natures bountie, and the earthes plentie,</p>
                  <p>The Countri-man had these informations to till the ground, to Plough their seasons, to Sow their Corne, to reape the blessings, to howse their Stuffe, to order their Cattell, to Plant fruite, to sow A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns, to set Wood, to quicke Ditches, to draine Marshes, to stocke Rootes, to cast Pondes, to sheate Sheepe, to trim Wooll, to weaue Cloth, to spinne Linnin, to dresse Hony, and to practise whatsoeuer labour might attaine to, or conceite imagine.</p>
                  <p>The Artificers were imployed to build strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to Wall with stone, to strengthen with Iron, to make warme with Glasse, to heaw Timber, to burne Brickes, to graue in Mettall, to cast Armour,

to digge Mines, to search Welles, to deuise for Shipes, to Tann Leather, and to furnish townes: so that nothing was left vndone, which belonged to the vse of man, nor any thing done according not to reason and wisdome.</p>
                  <p>Thus (noble Princes) flourished the Common-wealth fiue <hi>Lustrums</hi> togeather, vntill a wanton Securitie set on worke the worst part of mans ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciousnesse, and made euery paltry Controuersie rather a wicked Cauell, then a necessary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint: For in short time, many Sycophants grew in the Common-wealth, (<q>like some strange Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease on an infected body, which either carelesnesse or wilfulnesse neglected to cure, vntill it became vlcerous and past redresse,</q>) who neuer desisted from wrong information betwixt Neighbour and Neighbour; whereby they began in Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and ended in Despight.

                  <p>For speaking the truth, the men in authority (espetially to whom the determining of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies weare appoynted) not onely made benefit of the contentions of the people, but for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiablenesse of the benefit subuerted the first good intent of the lawes with quillites and detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being cunning indeed in nothing but detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: besides, touching priuat humours, this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous crossenesse chaunced, that where their owne originalls were for the most part base and obscure, they in the scorne and inueighing against others, laboured yet to ennoble themselues and their Children: Heere also was added the errors of higher officers euery one striuing to aduance his friend and follower to such places, which other men expected for desert, or had wonne with time of seruice and attendancie; nor was this sufficient, but the Common wealth was burthened with strange impositiones, &amp; diuers <hi>Monopolies</hi> brought

much mislike him, that did but his dutie to his Prince; nor the King, that offered fauour to his Subiect; nor her selfe, for beeing solicited by the mighty <hi>Ormisdates:</hi> But with a kind of abasshed drawing backe, rather studying to contriue her businesse to the best purpose, then willing to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any cause of mislike, shee yet made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, there was cause of mislike, saying, (and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most weeping in so saying) that the King wronged her much, to suppose shee would make sale of her Chastity; that hee wronged her more so to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion her dishonour, hauing neither seene nor heard any tokens by her of immodesty. All this, sayd <hi>Pasquito,</hi> is confessed: yet, quoth hee, the loue of a King is of that prerogatiue, that hee protested, it was more for her owne sake, then the Kings sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction hee came thither; and so by degrees of insinuation, fell to appeasing her; from appeasing to perswading, from perswading to counsayling, that howsoeuer she determined (which sayth he, I will not vrge further against your vertuous reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutio) it were not amisse to speake with the King.

                  <p>Thus was <hi>Anzitemus</hi> supplied, and which proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued aduantagious vnto him, hee bargayned with certaine Merchants by great for his conduct, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer troubling the <hi>Dukes</hi> Nauie, nor his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue to muster vp new forces; whereupon with all conueniencie they prouided him fourty well appointed Shippes, and became creditors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues for foure Months pay and victuals: In the meane while, the magnificent Company depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and King <hi>Zalby</hi> to augment his Nephewes honour, gaue <hi>Philano</hi> in present possession the Prouince of the nether <hi>Comagena;</hi> which hee in great courtesie acknowledged: yet modestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spyted the ceremonies of his enstawlement, till his returne.

                     <hi>Philanos</hi> presence would keepe obedience in forme: besides the Treasure returned by so conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient a Messenger would disburthen him of care and chardge to make a particular vioage.

the Maryage of <hi>Roxana</hi> was deferred, as not knowing how he was affected, and therfore without doubt he might determine for his owne kingdome.</p>
                  <p>Wherupon they made forward apace, and accordinge to their expectation without difficulty (more then the wonder of his returne, because they supposed him lost in the fight with <hi>Cleonidas)</hi> Landed in <hi>Armenia</hi> at the Riuer <hi>Erix,</hi> from whence by easie Iornies ouer the Mountaines, they came to <hi>Armamiranda,</hi> where <hi>Euphamia</hi> was resident; to whom the people vpon report of <hi>Anzitemus</hi> ariuall, had flocked on heapes, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her to stand as a guard betweene them and his displeasure, considering their obedience since, and the reuenge vpon <hi>Gestarius,</hi> who had opened the Dore of the last troubles.

establishing of all men in their estates, offices, and places, that would ratifie his succession.</p>
                  <p>With this comfort was the whole Kingdome <note place="margin">Anzitemus returneth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Armenia &amp; is inuested King.</note> appeased, and for the better assurance of their faythfull hearts, they confirmed the prerogatiues of his Maiestie, and conferred to him whatsoeuer belonged to a Kings person, establishing those Lawes, wherewith his Father and Grandfather had swayed the Common-wealth. The people brought in a guift of a thousand Talents; the Officers to continue their places, liberally fined them selues: the Nobilitie to renew their Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, sent many Presents: the Cities to strengthen their Priuiledges, disbursed great summes: the Gentry to aduance them selues, spared for no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable matter; and the Courtiers to purchase fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure, exceeded in cost and diligence: But when the incomparable <hi>Brizaca</hi> was published their Queene, they passed in extremity of applause, and sacrificed to the Gods for restoring their peace, and establishing the Monarchy in such worth and royalty.</p>
                  <p>THus was <hi>Anzitemus</hi> and <hi>Brisaca</hi> solemly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uested, and looking backe with regard vpon the worth of <hi>Euphamia,</hi> affoorded her the dignities of her Widdowhead, and permitted her the fruition of many Pallaces and Priuiledges: besides, in all Assemblies there was a Throane erected some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what higher then his owne, that the people might know, shee was the Kings Mother, and how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

hee desteemed her. Now though Fortune dad taken off the maske of Despight, and shewed him a countenance of fauour; yet neither seemed hee vaine or elated, but reposed, and indeed mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating that excesse of ioy, which sometimes many Princes after their aduancements, cannot hide. But it may be the meditation of his great affaires reduced him, because three especiall matters lifted vp their heads to be seene; and by being seene, to be remembred.</p>
                  <p>The first, was the discharge of the <hi>Zagarians,</hi> and dismissing <hi>Philano,</hi> which hee royally perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a Princely ouerplus, confirming the League, and wishing, if the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Medians</hi> did not agree, to hearken after <hi>Roxana:</hi> but when <hi>Trezoboro</hi> came to take his leaue of his Friend, it exceeded a Passion, and the louely <hi>Philano</hi> truly deciphered the force of Affection: So deuiding a Ring betweene them, because subiect to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they might be sure not to be vnknowne, they parted in body, but the loue of their hearts ended not in death. The Ring was artificially wrought, and enclosed with an enameled Scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loppe made of a Stone taken from the eyes of a <hi>Panther;</hi> but deuided, was not to be matched without the other: both parts had impression with their owne bloods from this counterchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mott; <hi>Nonaliud admittit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second proceeded from his care to <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus,</hi> to whom hee had engaged him selfe, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:2979:153"/>
about the redaction of both the Kingdomes to one <hi>Monarchy:</hi> But this was happily without further trouble determined; for not three dayes before <hi>Philano</hi> departed, the Embassadors of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> and <hi>Persia</hi> ariued, and after the ceremonie of gratification from all estates was ended, they she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed him a Commission contayning foure prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall poynts. First they tyed them selues to yeere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tribute, as acknowledging him the life, by which their polliticall bodyes did mooue in peace: The second exposed a perpetuetie of Alleageance: for Loue and Dutie was but a slender counterpoise to Life and Honour, which hee had so often ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentured for their sakes: The third concerned the Mariage of <hi>Roxana</hi> with <hi>Darius Artabanus</hi> Sonne: The last entreated for <hi>Cleonidas,</hi> whom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction had miracuiously spared, &amp; his owne pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency much bettered: To these he breifly made answere, the Tribute he did disclaime, as foresee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a Challenge might either grow to intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or moue their deniall, so heere after debate be the destruction of one another. Their loue and frendshippe he much relyed vpon: The Maryage of <hi>Roxana</hi> he anulled, dilating besides the hapinesse depending: but concerning <hi>Cleonidas Anzite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> interceded, as resolued the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, were not so slightly to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed,</p>
                  <p>The third and espetiall matter of importance consisted of many diffused partes, and therefore
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:2979:153"/>
intermixed the more trouble to vniforme it: and this was, how to reconcile <hi>Trezoboro</hi> to his father, considering the inconueniences proiected from the prophesie: First the <hi>Emperors</hi> goodwill hung in suspence, for he that feared before they were borne, could not but tremble now they were men; and of abillitie to defend themselues: Then the returne of <hi>Kalucky</hi> was doubtfull vpon the notice of the deceite: Thirdly the discussing of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle finding part true in the Maryage of <hi>Brizaca</hi> must needes hasten dipleasure: Next the mislike of <hi>Opacus,</hi> because his daughters had so presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, would sturre vp some troubles: Last of all the ielosie of himselfe, as the Principll cause of mischeife: For commonly men feare most the blow, that commeth last, and the Oracle conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that <hi>Mengrelius</hi> must be slaine by his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Husband.</p>
                  <p>THese particulars were orderly debated: at <note place="margin">Bertosus is sent Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador to the Emperor Mengrelius and discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the story of Trezoboro.</note> last his loue to his Queene and <hi>Trezoboro</hi> preuayled, eyther to make a peaceable attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or compulsiue entrance into <hi>Trebizonda:</hi> for which purpose <hi>Bertosus</hi> was sent Embassadour from the <hi>Armenian</hi> King to the Emperour <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grelius,</hi> to whom the report of <hi>Anzitemus</hi> recouery seemed so strange, that his feare of hee knew not what, presaged mischiefe to follow: yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the Prerogatiue of Kings; and that <hi>Bertosus</hi>

HOwsoeuer <hi>Historiographers</hi> haue written of <note place="margin">The story of Kalccki and Mullumalla</note> many strange Customes tending to inciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie amongst the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> in regard of the many strange Nations within so spacious a Country; yet haue they all concluded, that no people are of better obseruance toward their <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,</hi> nor <hi>Emperour</hi> so imperious ouer his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes; by reason whereof diuers Warres and Stratagems hath made them beleeue, the Crowne was held in the hand of Victorie, to be bestowed on the preuayler: But amongst others, the most famous chaunced betweene <hi>Barka</hi> and <hi>Allau,</hi> both Noble, valiant, beloued, and at one time nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated <hi>Emperours;</hi> yet by no meanes consenting to Deuision or Competition: Now because in such Conuulsions, there is no <hi>medium</hi> betweene an Emperour and Traytor, either striued as well to liue, as to reigne; so that the dissention continued with great difficultie and extremitie betweene them, at such time, as <hi>Kallucki</hi> dispossessed in <hi>Trebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zond,</hi> came with his complices into this Country; and politickly considering his estate, made offer of seruice in nature of a mercinarie Souldier vnto <hi>Barka,</hi> who superstitiously imputed his comming, as sent from Heauen to his assistance, and therfore without curiosity quartered him by himselfe &amp; sent a Treasurer with other officers to attend him: but it was not long ere he made Tryall of his vertue in some slender Skirmishes, which with admiration

of discipline and valiant execution he performed: Then he sent him to surprise a place entrenched, whether <hi>Allau</hi> had drawne his cheifest strength, and by the same both kept the passages and him selfe from danger, this seemed a matter of difficultie, yet with diuers pioners, and by lodging neere, they were able to make a Mine (a thinge as yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne amongst them) out of which in the dead of the night they issued on the enemie, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a notable slaughter, leueled the place with the ground, and so returned in Triumph: Lastly he put him in trust with Managing the maine Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile (for <hi>Allau</hi> would tryfle no longer, but appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a day of Tryall) wherin his Fortune and vallure ioyned in Leauge.

                  <p>This was soone perceiued by <hi>Mullumalla</hi> cheife <hi>Empres</hi> (for their coustomes allowed many wiues <note place="margin">The Empres Mullumalla in loue which Kalucki.</note> and more Concubines, &amp; yet was the Law of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie seuerely punished amongst them) who long since found her selfe surprised with his loue, and hunted after euery oportunitie to discouer her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which (hauing receiued impression from

                  <p>No sooner had the vertue of <hi>Kalucki</hi> shewed her excellencie, and the people more and more had him in estimation, whereby the new established <hi>Barka</hi> was to determine something for his recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and aduancement, but a certaine ielowsie of his insinuating into the fauor of the kingdome, and misconstruing his royall birth and right to <hi>Trebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zond,</hi> which all sortes began already to pittie, and so to fauor, slacked his loue toward him, &amp; weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the strength of his willingnesse to aduance him, nor leaft his conceite so: but a further peeuish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse whispered, that he sought to rob him of his subiects hearts: now when strange humours were entertained, strange distempratures followed, in so much that he one while resolued quite to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse him, as hauing no further occation to imploy him, but that he thought was too inhumaine, and

his Subiectes would neuer condiscend, vnlesse it were to recouer his Empire: Another-while hee studied to proportion him some remote corner to inhabit in: but heere hee mistrusted, it would be reputed a disgrace, as proceeding from a weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnesse of his Company, and then the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to thinke it a disgrace, might cause him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge it, as if it were a disgrace indeed.

Thus did the vncertaintie of the best course, inhibit the certaintie of any course, till at last the very feare of Alteration, encreased euery Conceit to preuent the feare: and when no meanes of contentment <note place="margin">Barka deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth to murder Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucki.</note> without his absence appeared, hee depended on this, by some course or other to make him away: <q>as for his Followers, the head beeing cut off, the rest of the members would quickly perish:</q> Yet lay hee awhile in waite to intrappe him in some haynous mulct or other; but fayling: hee concluded by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret callenture, or other diuelish imposture to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish his tragedy.</p>
                  <p>This was neither hid with so close a veyle, but <hi>Kalucki</hi> perceiued the <hi>Emperours</hi> incongruent behauiour toward him; nor debated with such trust, but <hi>Mullumalla</hi> foresaw the mischiefe, which shee not much repined against, because shee

Thus doe the brothers to the great applause of the people, greet one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the state of the Spectacle would make a vollume in the description: but time must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine all thinges, and these great Armies be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided: so <hi>Kalucki</hi> with treasure, Honor, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence returned to the magnanimous <hi>Mullumalla;</hi> to whom he made an offortory of himselfe and ritches, and <hi>Mengrelius</hi> with peace, libertie, and delight, was welcomed to <hi>Trebizond;</hi> where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie seemed for the time, to keepe her mansion, had not the wrathfull <hi>Nemesis</hi> (who neuer leaueth wrong and iniustice vnpunished) sent for Ielosie and Suspition to attend on her in the progresse of visiting <hi>Mengrelius,</hi> least the will of the Gods should prooue a mockery, and the ineuitable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees

                  <p>NO sooner was the <hi>Trebizondian</hi> Armie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, <note place="margin">The story of Mengrelius and Trezo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boro: with the fathers ielosy against the sonne by reason of the prophesie.</note> but <hi>Trezoboro</hi> sollemly proclaimed the Prince of peace, as well to cellebrate their late quietnesse, as to practise Martiall exploytes, went about some fruites of idlenesse with gloryous shoes to the people, and many Tri umphes to the Court: whereby he made way to the peoples loue to come in at, and euery mans eyes were fixed vpon his youth and comlinesse: as you see some forren Plant gracing a curious Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and the commers in regarding the rest to no purpose: this was despightfully pried into by some hatefull polliticeans, that terrefied the <hi>Emperor</hi> with blasoning his sonns demeanor, which might winn the hearts of the kingome from him: to these certaine old Councellers, rather stomaching to see their impatience &amp; peremptorinesse abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then daring to set a foote Broyles and discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, added the greatnesse of the charge (consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Treasure was much wasted with their last businesse) the disorders of idle attendants, the pride of his followers, the slendernesse of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Court, all which set his thoughts at randome, &amp; some of them stumbled on the wrested interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the prophesie, which <hi>Mengrelius</hi> (fearing most the blow, that came last) absolutely beleeued, began to draw neerer and neerer to the full effect,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:2979:172"/>
and so began a strange manner of Melancholy, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questring him selfe from conuersation; and when necessitie compelled him abroad, hee grew impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and irrigular: but the greatest cause of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, accrewed from the suggestion of diuers, who through the credite of <hi>Belgorundo,</hi> made euery paltry appearance of a litle skill to carry the true countenance of Learning and Diuination, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in practise the <hi>Cabalisticall</hi> Art, <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Characters, <hi>Astronomicall</hi> Figures, <hi>Hierogliphicall</hi> representations, <hi>Augurings,</hi> and <hi>Pithonicall</hi> Incan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; which with some slender likelihood were intermixed: so that the Court swarmed with a troope of diuelish <hi>Astronomers</hi> (a kind of people alwayes forbidden, and alwayes retained) whose strange Attire and Demeanour, gaue occasion of laughter and astonishment: the people counting them wise and extraordinary; the better sort deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them, as buffonns and deceiuers.</p>
                  <p>With such illusions was <hi>Mengrelius</hi> quite caried from him selfe, and on a sodaine consented to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that none (of what estate soeuer) should inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with the <hi>Emperors</hi> retyering, nor appoynt extraordinary meetings without the verge of the Court, which was strangely taken at the first: but <hi>Trezoboro</hi> discouering the secret, was contented to repaire to the Pallace; which his presence quickly filled with entercourse of people, and the applause range by the <hi>Emperors</hi> eares; who in short time misliked it farre worse then the other, as almost by
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:2979:172"/>
eye-witnesse perceiuing, he meant to infinuate into the vulgar opinion to irrite a faction: From hence a plaine displeasure arose by commaunding the <hi>Prince</hi> to depart the Court: then wrought his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence beliefe of euery thing reported; and added withall, that the opportunitie made him study on the disgrace, and so prepare the reuenge; (For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there wanted not those, which proposed to <hi>Trezoboro</hi> his Fathers cruelty at the beginning, his wretched hate now, the errours of many men about him; and that there was no reason he should permit the indignitie: but these he suffered as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in an house seruing to gather the Poyson and Venome of the Ayre, that the rest may be more sweete and holsome:) till at last, a wretched sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise displaied the ensiugnes of hate against him; which was too true, by reason all his fauourites and attendants were remooued, or neglected. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listhenes</hi> aman of an high linage, and dilicat witte, which by some extraordinary pleasantnes got the name of Good conceit; and yet till now made gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious with the <hi>Empresse,</hi> was checked with the tearme of <hi>mimus</hi> for slender glauncing at the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> melancholy. Another demanding but the cause of the <hi>Princes</hi> sequestration, was imprisoned. A third, making a <hi>Satiricall</hi> Inuection against especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all persons, was publickly whipt. A fourth, saying, the <hi>Prince</hi> was more worthy submitted to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of a seuere Iudgement: which made a great alteration; and to be plaine, slacked the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:2979:173"/>
and dutie euer borne toward him.</p>
                  <p>Thus remained all places full of rumours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in confusion spred many dispositions abroad: some saying the <hi>Emperor</hi> was ill directed, or worse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined: some that the Prince was causelesly wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: some layed the fault on priuate persons, who hauing a long time swaied the Common-wealth, feared least the quicke conceite of others would detect their ill gouernment, and therefore ment vnder publike pretences to preuent priuate mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheifes: some blamed the <hi>Emperors</hi> credulytie of the coosening sort of Magy: some affirmed he was quite distracted, and some dared exclaime, that fearing he knew not what, he would ruine the Common-wealth, and Butcher vp his Children, as he had done before: These speeches had diuers effects both with <hi>Mengrelius</hi> and <hi>Trezobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> the father assuring it a practise of defamation, and the sonne suspecting his fathers crueltie; which was the more greeuous vnto him, because he had deserued so well: so that now to secure himselfe he was enforced to stand on his Guard, and that incited the <hi>Emperor</hi> to proclaime him Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <note place="margin">Trezoboro in Armes &amp; proclaimed Traytor.</note> the seueritie of which edict deuided the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and an vnnaturall Ciuell warre ensued, wherein many stratagems and Turmoyles dislo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the Pillars &amp; stayes of the <hi>Empier:</hi> for <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grelius</hi> with his yeeres grew wilfull, irregular, and dangerous, mistrusting his most trusty Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants; and when any dared to request a Pacificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:2979:173"/>
he would not abide it. His Mother and Wife were ircksome, and all things at home framed them selues to the vnframing his quiet. Abroad he was sure the Cities would regard their preseruation to come. The discontented persons would adhere to his Sonne, as well to auoyde the Lawes penall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, as in hope of recompence and reward. The Noble men and Gentrie, by reason of former neglect, would questionlesse make them selues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the <hi>Prince.</hi> Some yet aduanced, would not degenerate: and others in Office or Account, for their own safeties would continue alleageance: with these, &amp; such, whom the very name of <hi>Emperor</hi> mustred vp, he made an ouer-maistring party, and in his owne person performing actions beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, strengthned the opinion of such, as stood wauering betwixt duty and pitty.</p>
                  <p>But when <hi>Trezoboro</hi> perceiued, that hee which standeth onely on defence, is farre from Victorie, hee then shewed his Father the force of a mighty Arme; with which he held out a long time: but at last, was compelled to retire to <hi>Pelagium,</hi> a place designed him for his Estate, and conuenient for Victualing and relieuing his Armie. Hither did <hi>Mengrelius</hi> prosecute him, and <hi>Trezoboros</hi> flight somwhat ouerswayed the common opinion, neuer certaine, but in vncertainties; so that the <hi>Emperor</hi> seemed cheared with his good proceedings, &amp; his Sonnes tryall; whereupon somewhat cunningly thinking to presse the Enemie, while they were

yeelding, hee proclaymed Pardon to all those, which would forsake the Prince: the rest he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced guiltie of the Crime of <hi>Maiestie:</hi> Then seemed he to dally with crueltie, promising one hundred Tallents to any would bring him in dead or a liue: and last of all, encountred with his forces to great aduantage, which <hi>Trezoboro</hi> perceiuing would in time worcke him out, and that his retar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance gaue libertie for a <hi>Russian</hi> Armie to helpe his father, he dispatched a messenger to <hi>Anzite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and an other to <hi>Opacus</hi> of <hi>Capadocia,</hi> who by reason of the <hi>Emperors</hi> ielosie and stomach against them, as the causes of his feare, were not vsed, not sent vnto in their late troubles, and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing they were neglected or despised, a displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure arose against <hi>Mengrelius,</hi> and this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie made them the willinger to ioyne with the Prince: especially <hi>Anzitemus,</hi> who with foure legions of old soldiers came in person to his ayde: as for <hi>Opacus,</hi> from <hi>Phrigia, Lidia,</hi> and his owne kingdome, he made an Armie of one hundred 20. Thousand, and gaue the Honor of their conduct to <hi>Delano</hi> a man of experience, great yeeres, and well beloued; yet suppressed from aduancement, by reason <hi>Cuprax</hi> the sonne of the Duke of <hi>Pantalia,</hi> seemed a fauorite in Courte, and would haue drawne the managing of Martiall affayres to him selfe, had not <hi>Trezoboro</hi> by name entreated for <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lano,</hi> and the Soldiers compelled out of their Country disclaimed any other.</p>

                     <pb n="345" facs="tcp:2979:174"/>
BVt when <hi>Mengrelius</hi> vnderstood, that <hi>Anzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temus</hi> was come himselfe, a sodaine trembling disproportioned his former Courage, and the Oracle (like a hellish vision appearing) mightely perplexed him, and was indeed the author of strange courses, which at last ouerturned his good successe, yet he went orderly to worke, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with the <hi>Armenians,</hi> before they were vnited to his sonns forces, who had much a doe to make their passage by reason the Boates were not yet come from <hi>Trezoboro,</hi> and <hi>Anzitemus</hi> had commaunded, that no man should lay violent <note place="margin">Auzitemus ioyneth with Trezoboro: killeth Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grelius, fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uesteth Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoboro Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</note> handes on the Emperor, but this interception en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the name of a skirmish: For <hi>Anzitemus</hi> with <hi>Delanos</hi> assistance quickely passed their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie by a Bridge made of the Boates: and helped with great Furre-trees keeping equall distance of Twentie foote, and although the water was very broad; yet industry with the conueniencie of the place for woode, layed Plankes vpon the Beames, and so in one day both Horse and foote passed ouer in a manner within sight of the Enemie: For some two mile from the Riuer they had so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched the passages, that <hi>Mengrelius</hi> supposed they ment their to haue encamped, little thinking <hi>Delano</hi> played the Lapwing, who cryeth farthest from his Neast: and when he seemed most busie to fortefie a place of securytie, the maine Armie mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched that night vnder a Woodes side to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:2979:175"/>
and the next day put ouer, while the <hi>Trebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zondians</hi> prepared against the Campe, which they supposed was so neere them: But being thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, they had liberty to complaine, but small meanes of reuenge, onely the <hi>Emperour</hi> vnited his Forces againe, and assured he was better prouided, determined to dally no longer, but put it to a triall; wherein if Fortune fayled, he was certaine to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Aduersarie, and renew his owne Armie at pleasure; and so one day might affoord, what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did deny.</p>
                  <p>By this time is <hi>Anzitemus</hi> and <hi>Delano</hi> welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the <hi>Prince,</hi> who hoping by course of paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to end the Warre, sent to <hi>Mengrelius</hi> by faire intreaty not to conceiue so hardly of so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a sonne, and they would engage their Honor, he entended nothing but fayth and dutie: this mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage wrought no otherwise, then if <hi>Trezoboro</hi> would absolutely committe himselfe to his fathers tuition without hostage or other couenant, it might be the <hi>Emperor</hi> would forgiue him, to this <hi>Anzitemus</hi> opposed, yeelding many reasons, and by a second treatie vrged the burying vnder foote of all displeasures, the remission and restoring his followers, and the confirming him Heire appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:2979:175"/>
the Armies to audience, and the <hi>Emperour</hi> to vnderstand, what must be trusted vnto. To this, the feare of the Souldiers, rather then his owne willingnesse, compelled him: and so <hi>Anzitemus</hi> in the front of his Armie thus deliuered his minde.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I am not ignorant (great <hi>Emperour,</hi> and mis-led people) that Wisedome and good Counsaile are sometimes vnseasonable, especially in a time of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry &amp; hate amongst men of Warre, commaunded and countenanced by the Kings owne person; yet haue you no such cause either to put in armes these men, or Armed to make them butcher them selues: For though the Father fight there, the Sonne is not absent heere: though the elder Brother vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding not the truth, is with <hi>Mengrelius,</hi> the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger attendes on <hi>Trezoboro:</hi> And though a Friend is enroulled with you, one of the Family is amongst vs: and were not this lamentable, though neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie compelled it? But now to proceed with out order, ground, or reason, what scandall can be more opprobrious? What cause more detestable? All men haue written, that Violence continues not: yet haue you begun in the Cradle, and are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased after many yeares: and why? the <hi>Emperour</hi> is terrefied with an Oracle, and suspects his owne Children. Hath the Gods preserued them for this? Hath his Towardlinesse deserued this? Hath his Valloure in your late Broyles been shewed for this? Hath his Life been so often hazarded for this? Hath your Peace been wrought for this? Hath
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:2979:176"/>
your Prosperitie followed for this? Yea, hath Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers been ashamed of the Composition; and the mighty <hi>Kalucki</hi> receiued him to fauour for this? And will now the Common-wealth teare her owne Bowels? the Members seeke their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction by despising the Head; and the Father murder his owne Child? It is execrable and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable. But touching the Prophesie, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it not, what needeth this feare? To beleeue it, what way of preuention? But you will say, it is ambiguous. I reply, Malice must not misconsture, nor Wisedome be ouerruled with Supposes. For concerning the <hi>Prince,</hi> (by the Deuine power which ruleth all Princes) you can alleadge neither cause, reason, nor likelihood. How then haue you wronged your Renowne, and insorcered their Obedience? else would they neuer consent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy one another, to ruine their Countrey, make hauocke of their owne increases, see &amp; suffer mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe to knocke at their doores; and with the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants fight against Heauen: or like that vnnaturall Bird, denowring them that hatcheth her; seeke to destroy the Successor, on whose safetie dependeth all their liues. Leaue off therefore for shame: leaue off; either yeeld a reason of your actions, or desist from your vnreasonablenesse? But you will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, It is sufficient the <hi>Emperour</hi> commaundes. I doe say no; hee is but the Steward of the Gods, subiect to account; and ordained to forme, not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue the Common-wealth.</q>

But as a further vehemencle might haue agraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the matter, the Souldiers began to repine, some demaunding whether the <hi>Prince</hi> raysed the Warre, or desired to saue him selfe? Some for what cause <hi>Mengrelius</hi> prosecuted his Sonne? Some stoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to see intestine Dissipation. Some hardly belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the <hi>Prince</hi> began Innouation, considering he was to expect the Kingdomes to florish hereafter. Some said, though the <hi>Emperor</hi> were offended, the submission of a Sonne might appease any Father. Some absolutly denied to destroy the Prince, and the rest liked not, a wise man to be caryed away with dreames or deuises, especially when the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the <hi>Empire</hi> must succeed: but <hi>Mengrelius</hi> enraged with this diuision exclamed only on dutie and alleageance threatning the reuolters with death, and attempting with stripes to terrefie diuers in the speed of escape, but it smally preuailed. For the greatest part fled a fore his face to his sonne, which <hi>Anzitemus</hi> tooke the aduantage of and encountered with the rest in sollemne manner of hostillitie, so that a terrible fight began, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time ouerlooked a dangerous conflict: in which the victory was a mournfull Triumph: For it ended with the cryes and teares of <hi>Orpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> for their Fathers, Fathers for their Children, Brother, for Brother, one Kinsman for another and freend for freend: yea such was the misery and mischiefe of the error amongst them, that a sonne was found mourning ouer a Carkasse, whom he
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:2979:177"/>
had slaine, and perceiuing it his owne father after a ruthfull complaint, kild himselfe: the horror of which sight, daunted the stoutest courage, and made them all cry out vpon the cause of their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; which <hi>Anzitemus</hi> tooke hold of, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Emperor had escaped (and as he afterward lernt) to <hi>Samarchanda</hi> with a quiet demeanor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called them togeather, and though the Skirmish and their owne feares had disperced them farre off: yet handled he the matter so well, that they were contented to returne; and finding <hi>Trezoboro</hi> as sad for their greifes, as his owne misfortune, which by his Honorable protestations in the necessitie to saue his life, and vnwillingnesse to disquiet so good subiects, they saw apparant, in so much that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind teares brake off the Princely discourse: they shouted for ioy, and with a new Comicall applause sware, they would obey no other Emperor then <hi>Trezoboro:</hi> as for <hi>Mengrelius</hi> seeing his ill disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had taught him the way to Tyranie, they sawe no reason to betray vertue, or be in subiection any longer to inhumanitie. Surely sayed <hi>Anzitemus,</hi> the Gods haue taken compassion vpon you, and you and we will now be one body, but of necessitie the body must haue a head, or else the Members perish, therefore we will inuest <hi>Trezoboro</hi> your Emperor, and he shall renew your peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortes: This (as according to their owne desires) they soone consented to, and so in midst of all the Armie was he aduanced, inuested, and solemnly
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:2979:177"/>
proclaymed <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Trebizond,</hi> and all the <note place="margin">Mengrelius deposed and Trezoboro chosen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</note> Kingdomes adioyning; <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Peace, Lord</hi> of the great <hi>Sea,</hi> and <hi>Seruant</hi> to the high <hi>Gods.</hi> Then sange they a Himne in his honour to <hi>Bellona,</hi> and a Song to <hi>Diana.</hi> And lastly, with <hi>Panegericall</hi> Ceremonies, they brought him to <hi>Mengrelius</hi> royall Tent, which the Souldiers had reuerently preserued in the defeat.</p>
                  <p>But when vnfortunate <hi>Peristoll</hi> (whom for his ill newes he commaunded to be slaine) had enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the proceedings of the Campe, and that the Prince had taken vpon him the Diademne, neuer was impatience apter to be described: For now he raged indeed, and put in practise many actions of distemperature, as assuring him selfe the Oracle was compleat; onely the last poynt (which was his death) yeelded more terrour in the suspition, then a thousand mischiefes in full execution: Yet he lifted vp once againe the countenance of Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loure, and with his supply out of <hi>Russia,</hi> many Mercenaries from <hi>Scithia</hi> and <hi>Europa,</hi> and the rest, (worthy to be beloued for being true to their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,) hee set forward a mightier Armie then the first; which in short time confronted his Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who were comming forward apace to take possession of the Citties: So that nothing was to be expected, but forcible and confused Prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of loue and dutie; wherefore they gaue Reuenge full scope to make one day of death for all: And the Battaile began with a horrible and
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:2979:178"/>
impetuous violence, wherein to see the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pred <hi>Mengrelius</hi> with a well graced fury whirling amongst the troupes, would haue pittied his dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating humors, and admired his strength and valoure; but <hi>Trezoboros</hi> approache deuided these thoughts, who finding the <hi>Emperour</hi> enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to his great danger contrary to expectation, commaunded them to desist, and so yeelded him freedome to worke his madnesse on some other subiect. An other time <hi>Anzitemus</hi> chaunced where destruction indeed was comming apace, and deliuered him: which hee tooke in greater scorne, because the Souldiers cryed, See the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of <hi>Trezoboro:</hi> see the pietie of <hi>Anzitemus.</hi> But this I say caryed him to disdaine indeed; and perceiuing him selfe spared by speciall appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hee changed his Horse and Armour, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the Battaile vnknowne, (For by this time, neither Order nor Discipline serued) and determined to single out his Sonne, with such a minde, as a man after a solemne Vow, which he is resolued to keepe, endeuoreth to bring to effect. But <hi>Anzitemus</hi> (hauing seene <hi>Perneades</hi> sequester him selfe from the company, with purpose to draw foorth such men as he prouided in ambush) suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the <hi>Emperour</hi> had been hee, and so encountred with him before the sodaine approch might strike a feare amongst the wearied, and already fainting troopes; and after a gallant Battaile, Death rushed in with a blow, which the King with both his hands
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:2979:178"/>
stroke at his head, whose steely Couert not firmely setled, yeelded to the violence; shewing that nothing in the world is permanent, nor any man in life secure: so the <hi>Emperour</hi> shruncke vnder the burden of this misfortune, &amp; yeelded to an honorable vntimelines: <note place="margin">Mengrelius slaine, and the Prophesie fulfilled.</note> which was the more lamentable, because hee sought the destruction of his Sonne, and came to a ruthfull end by his Daughters husband.</p>
                  <p>But when <hi>Anzitemus</hi> had time to ouerlooke, and know it was <hi>Mengrelius,</hi> vnkinde remembrance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded him with sorrow at the accident, and cursed the hand, that yet pleaded ignorance in the deed; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning confounded, vntill the rumour and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of people brought <hi>Trezoboro</hi> thither: at last came <hi>Calisthenes, Orchanes, Hardubax:</hi> at last came the rest; all more troubled with griefe, then proud of their owne quietnesse: so that the Victorie represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted variety of Discomfort, rather then solemnity of a Triumph: For what with recording those many Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues abounding in him, whereof euery one had boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully participated; and the present spectacle so full of remorse, they sorrowed beyond measure, and <hi>Trezo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boro</hi> was compelled to make his entrance into the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> with incongruent demeanour, &amp; had celebrated (if the State would haue permitted it) with one solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity his fathers Exequies, and his owne Coronation. By this time, was the Oracle published abrod, &amp; wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome interdicted an vnmeasurable discomfort in a matter-remediles, &amp; appoynted ineuitable: so to make a nevv account with delight, <hi>Anzitemus</hi> was impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned to send for <hi>Brizaca,</hi> least she were altogeather
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:2979:179"/>
depriued of that benefite, (which Children receiue from the knowledge of their Parents.) This asked a litle time of deliberation: but the importunities of the <hi>Empresses</hi> preuailed; so the charge of the Iorney was committed to <hi>Philtranus</hi> Prince of <hi>Cilicia:</hi> As for the Army, he deuided that into two parts, sending the one by land vnder the command of <hi>Kazopletus;</hi> the other by Sea with <hi>Pelorus</hi> sonne of <hi>Pelorus, Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazes</hi> Admirall: both to remaine vndissolued, till hee him selfe returned; in the meane while, his Mother <hi>Euphamia</hi> to rest <hi>Regent</hi> by a new Commission.</p>
                  <p>These matters had the effect of diligence and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, &amp; <hi>Philtranus</hi> came fortunately into <hi>Armenia,</hi> &amp; informed the <hi>Queene</hi> of all occurrents, with the plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible directions for her progresse to <hi>Trebizond.</hi> Heere the intermixtion of contraries, kept her from the full entertainement of ioy; so that her Fathers <hi>Catastro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe</hi> extinguished the delight of her Brothers aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: to which an other home mischiefe was added, the returne of <hi>Cleonidas,</hi> who presuming on the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of <hi>Anzitemus,</hi> and the Nauie vnder <hi>Pelorus,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Confines of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and attempted a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Innouation. But before we certifie this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, let vs see, how Fortune ouerlooked him in the danger after the Sea-fight with <hi>Anzitemus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BY that time, <hi>Cleonidas</hi> and <hi>Anzitemus</hi> (through <note place="margin">The story of Cleonidas af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile with Anzitemus.</note> the effect of his diuelish reuenge) were deuided, and their Ships burnt and dismembred, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible lamentation of so many men so many wayes yeelding vp the last powers of their soules,
<q>
                        <pb n="355" facs="tcp:2979:179"/>
stroke him to the heart, and (because his pestilent humour had no subiect to worke vpon) it boyld with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him like a Furnace, ouerheating all the partes of his body and minde,</q> so that he could haue been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to haue made his owne seperation, considering a guilty Conscience laide open the records of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faults: But euen when Death had been most bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall, the necessitie of Life, with the kindnesse of the impartiall element, draue the vnfirme Seate wheron he sate to another peece of a Shippe, from whence ouerburdned, hee saw fourteene cast into the Sea, as supposing it the nearest way to Heauen, through the reflexion the Heauens made in the Water: On this by great chaunce he got, and was tossed too and fro with the Billowes, as if Destruction meant to make a Game of his danger: at last after two dayes, hee was driuen on a sandie Iland not farre from the Continent of <hi>Persia;</hi> wherein he mused at his owne ignorance, that hauing so long time scowred all the coast of the <hi>Hircanian</hi> Sea, hee was yet vnacquainted with this place.</p>
                  <p>Heere a very instinct of Nature put him to his shiftes, and by striking two Flintes on certaine Reeds lying in the place, he shuffled vp a Fire; whose effects made the returne of warmth and strength, the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of life: at which the inhabitants (who were onely Seruants and Officers attending on the Priestes heere liuing) wondred, who had presumed without order of Ceremony, to dishonour the place: For this was called the <hi>Iland of Fire,</hi> and had two Chappels therein; one dedicated to <hi>Vulcano,</hi> the other to the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:2979:180"/>
                     <hi>Sanne;</hi> in which after the <hi>Persian</hi> manner, the <hi>Priestes</hi> were appoynted to liue, who onely had power to giue leaue to the Inhabitants to make their Fiers for necessities sake; which yet was not done without presence of a Religious man: Wherevpon they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended <hi>Cleonidas,</hi> and brought him to <hi>Sicambus</hi> the <hi>Archpriest</hi> in the same manner they found him: But when with an extraordinary courage in the <hi>Sirian</hi> language (because hee was to speake to a man of his profession) he discouered him selfe, and that <hi>Sicambus</hi> vnueiled his ignorance, remembring hee had seene him with <hi>Astiages</hi> in <hi>Persia,</hi> &amp; by many meanes heard of his fame, he comforted him the best hee could; but the best he could, preuented not a strange Sicknesse, which with an vnkind detention kept him full two yeares retiered, and confirmed their opinion, which supposed him perished: in the end, the firmenesse of his compleat manhood, and well seasoned body, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maistred the tiranny, and he recouered both in health and reformation: for after his penitency had prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted a remorce of the action against <hi>Artabazes,</hi> and abiured his ill manner of life; the religious Father cheared him with the comfort, which followes true repentance, and by examples confirmed his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to amendment. Vpon this, they appoynted to goe into <hi>Persia,</hi> and accordingly ariued at <hi>Suziana</hi> much about the time <hi>Anzitemus</hi> fortunes were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished through <hi>Asia;</hi> which he rather woondred, then stomaked at, not doubting to make his peace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consiliation, which his hope supposed by <hi>Zaloppos</hi> meanes (when the <hi>Persian</hi> Embassadours went to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia)</hi>
                     <pb n="357" facs="tcp:2979:180"/>
to bring to passe: But their returne certified <hi>Anzitemus</hi> slight answere in that behalfe, and hee smothered the indignation for a time; but vnable to suppresse it, gaue Libertie at last, to burst foorth into flames of Despight, and in this manner proceeded.</p>
                  <p>Certaine summes of Mony disbursed for <hi>Astiages,</hi> he demaunded of the Queene <hi>Roxana:</hi> which awhile bred scruple and doubt, by reason of their Articles with <hi>Anzitemus</hi> and <hi>Artabanus;</hi> yet after a little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating, they were repayed with a plenary cancelling of all accounts: For being a matter chancing before this new Contract, and in her Fathers behalfe, shee thought it dishonorable to trifle him out with deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses or excuses. Many of his Souldiers setled in their Townes, which the hast of his busines permitted not to carry with him, he requested againe: This was left to their owne desires, because in this space maried, and brought vp amongst them, they would not seeme to banish them by compulsion: So the most of them louing Spoyles better then Pay, hasted to <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidas.</hi> With this Mony and this Supply, he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his owne <hi>Iland,</hi> and gathering his Friends and Confederats togeather, with fourty sayle of well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Ships, and fiftie Hulks for the transportation of his Army, he tooke the aduantage of the Kings absence in the <hi>Trebizondian</hi> Warres, and made speed for <hi>Armenia,</hi> landing his Forces at such time, as <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zopletus</hi> and <hi>Pelorus</hi> were returned from <hi>Anzitemus;</hi> and <hi>Philtranus</hi> came with directions to attende the Queene <hi>Brisaca</hi> to her Mother. But this they were ignorant of, and diuers vnsetled Humors, as idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:2979:181"/>
and endangered to the Law; vpon the tumour of <hi>Cleonidas</hi> ariuall, to the number of foureteene thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, made a head in nature of <hi>Particeans,</hi> and certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, they were ready, and resolued to ioyne with him; for their hearts and discontentments, had engaged them already; as if they meant to giue this notice, that in the best Hiue there be Drones and robbers of them that labour: but as their willingnes set them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, their forwardnes puld them backe, as disorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without a Head, and hauing bad intelligence: For the vnlooktfor comming of <hi>Kazopletus</hi> ouertooke them with that speed, that <hi>Cleonidas</hi> had scarc notice, before the distraction dispersed and Iustice quickly scourged them all.</p>
                  <p>Thus was this fanaticall Company discomfited, and <hi>Cleonidas</hi> in a manner as soone ouerthrowne: For vpon report, how Mischance had put on a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble visage against him, he made a retreat to his Ships; but ere he could house his men, <hi>Kazopletus</hi> by land, and <hi>Pelorus</hi> by Sea, had so hemnd him in, that though it prooued a gallant and tedious Skirmish, full of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation and example; yet his Fleete was suncke and dissipated, his Companies quite defeated, and him selfe taken prisoner, and sent to <hi>Sagarena,</hi> where <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaca</hi> kept her Court; but shee vnwilling to proceed against him without directions from <hi>Anzitemus,</hi> by the counfaile of <hi>Euphamia,</hi> committed him to Ward in the same place, where his Father had once besiedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the beautious <hi>Artaxata.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Cleonidas</hi> saw him selfe thus disappoynted and captiued, and that the last Acte of his Tragedy was
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:2979:181"/>
in hand, to which the Gates of Shame and Death; or Death with the shame stood onely open, he made it a matter of some repining: yet as a man of excellent Resolution, hee neither seemed much dismayed, or abated: For to complaine of Godes, or Men, of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or the World, he thought it a property of such, as desired to liue. Againe, to crane pardone, sue to Friends, and make base Submission, hee imputed to such as feared to die; so that Death appeared now like a welcome Friend, if the reproch might be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, which made such an impression, that he prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted <hi>Anzitemus</hi> should not triumph in his disgrace, not vse his liuing body contumeliously: yet when there seemed want of meanes to effect this glorious Acte (as hee supposed) beeing left destitute of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision, hee then boyled for very rage, and was enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to coole him selfe with a Cup of cold Water; which working a better temperature, somewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him, and then he reprehended his dulnesse, that conceiued not the infinite wayes, whereat Death might make her entrance; wherevpon with circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection (as if Desperatnesse meant to intreat her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary aduise) hee searched about the Chamber, at last finding a rysing in the Wall, where a Flint sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued out his Corner, with a maine careere he dashed <note place="margin">The death of Cleonidas.</note> out his brairies, leauing rather example of Manhod, then Conscience.</p>
                  <p>With the death of <hi>Cleonidas,</hi> remayned <hi>Armenia</hi> fully quieted, and <hi>Brizaca</hi> without further suspition, might prepare for her progresse; to which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry of <hi>Philiranus,</hi> and the dutie of her Subiectes
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:2979:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
added outward Ritches and Pompe; nor was shee behinde them for State and Maiestie: So that shee set forward to their Ioy and Amazement from whence shee came, &amp; to their Delight &amp; Contentment, to whom shee went. But when <hi>Anzitemus</hi> vnderstood of <hi>Cleonidas</hi> death, hee tooke the newes (as it were in ill part,) because hee thought him selfe disappoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of a great deale of Honour in the courses meant toward him: yet ballansing the assurance of his owne Peace and quietnes withall, hee gaue way to more seasonable desires, and seemed satisfied with the wantonnesse of the time, and the pleasure of the place, which delighted with varietie: so that if his owne importunities had not compelled his returne into <hi>Armenia,</hi> hee might very easily haue vsurped the felicitie of another Kingdome.</p>
