            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Did thinke it a matter not altogether vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, (<hi>most Mighty Prince</hi>) if presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the solemnization of your Princely <hi>Creae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with military spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles (wherein innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable beholders did, in your reioycing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate both the happy comfort of your Royall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, our Gratious Soueraigne, and the hopefull ioy of this whole land) I likewise should present vnto you a kinde of military <hi>Encounter;</hi> which is, although lesse solemne, yet more serious, because it oppugneth an Aduersary vnto your Highnesse, not in a counterfait shew and semblance, but in deede and reall practize:

one, who labored to vndermine the right both of his Maiesties possessions, and of your future succession in this land: then whome this Age hath not found any Scribe more prompt and plausible, or yet a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasiue and powerfull Inchaunter.</p>
            <p>For it is he who once durst exclude, in his <hi>Doleman,</hi> the Royal line of <hi>Henry</hi> the seauenth from the Crown <note place="margin">

               <hi>written or done by any Catholike, which with some might brcede disgust, was directed only to the end that his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty might be a Catholike, before he should be a King.</hi> Which two how can they consist? for either must he haue in the former abused his Mistris the <hi>Infanta,</hi> or in the later deluded our Soueraigne <hi>King Iames.</hi> He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in his <hi>Mitigation</hi> protested and promised loyall subiection in the behalfe of all Romanists, and was held a credible Proctor for his Clients; yet since, in this his last <hi>Reckoning</hi> (bringing in, as it were, a sharpe axe to behead Kings of a contrary profession) he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth that <hi>none may be an head in Christian commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion who is excommunicate,</hi> and notwithstanding here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in also he wanted not an applause; So potent a <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> was he.</p>
            <p>Of him we heare it now daylie noised by some that say, <hi>Our Aduersary</hi> M. Parsons <hi>is dead:</hi> which reporte may be beleeued but only in part; for although it be
<pb facs="tcp:13232:3"/>
possible that <hi>M. Parsons</hi> be dead, yet will not <hi>our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary</hi> die, as long as his bookes, or cause shall liue in the handes and hartes of his fauorites. As for me, at the first hearing of these news I knew not wel whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rather to reioyce, that he was not suffered any longer to delude the simple; or grieue, that he was taken away before that he could see his owne errours, which are very foule, and in this <hi>Encounter</hi> fully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered: I say no more, so farre am I from imitating his spirit, by insulting vpon the Ghosts of the dead.</p>
            <p>Concerning your selfe (<hi>most Noble, and renouned Prince</hi>) it is the longing desire of all them, who are like piously affected, as were Gods people, when they prayed for the long life both of <hi>Nabuchodnosor,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <note place="margin">Baruch. 1. 11.</note> of <hi>Baltasar his sonne;</hi> that you would stand vpon two guardes, the one is <hi>Confidence</hi> in God, the other is wise and due <hi>Prouidence</hi> vnder God. For God, who was for many yeares so powerfull and glorious, in defending his truth in the weakenesse of a woman (Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the King of Queens) in time of extream ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility, against a most potent enemy, euen when hee boasted of his <hi>Inuincible Nauie,</hi> &amp; made that godly and thrise noble <hi>Deborah</hi> to singe of the vast <hi>Ocean</hi> after the olde tune of the Riuer <hi>Kishon,</hi> to wit, <hi>The Riuer Kishon</hi>

               <hi>History of</hi> a man, who farmed a custome and tallage, which was taken at a bridge of all such passengers as were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diseased, or else notoriously deformed: So it was that one, that passed ouer the bridge, who had <hi>distortum vultum,</hi> was called vpon to pay a peny; which the passenger refused to pay: The Toller caps the fellow, and with that perceiueth that he had an other disease on his head, called <hi>Alopecia,</hi> and therefore he demaundeth of the party an other peny; but the Trauailer resisteth, and struggleth with the Toller, yet being not able to make his part good, is laide along on the ground, where, by some disaduantage, he bewraied an other disease, which he called the <hi>Hernia,</hi> and thereupon was charged to pay a third peny: there was no remedy, the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome must be paid.</p>
            <p>In some like sort shall my Reader (in the perusall of this <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter</hi>) finde the matter to fall forth betweene me and M. <hi>Parsons,</hi> wherein may be obserued, that the more he contendeth and struggleth, the more he intangleth himselfe, and bewrayeth

               <hi>had not vsed such asperity of speeches against me.</hi> This sheweth that he had some cause to betake himselfe to a more <hi>sober and quiet Reckoning:</hi> wherein, notwithstanding, he dealeth so violently with me, (as my Reader will easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue) that he often falsifieth the Title of his booke, not only by heaping vp more grieuous Acerbities, then formerly he had done, but also by setting against me <hi>Gretzerus</hi> to plow vpon my backe, who is a stranger and a Iesuit, and so profuse and professed a railer, that <note n="f" place="margin">Cùm vnum ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </note> 
               <hi>whereas but one of his bookes was to be sould in West-Friesland, no man would buy it, because of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible slanders and railings which are therein.</hi> In all which kinde of raging tempests, I haue learned to cast this Anchor; <hi>Non qui patitur, sed qui facit iniuriam, miser est:</hi> And so I leaue this default of <hi>M.

            <p>In further examining of him hee bewrayed an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> both by absurdities in <hi>Syllogizing;</hi> as concluding of <hi>Are,</hi> in steade of <hi>Make;</hi> and being earnestly charged therewith, hath not yeelded so much as one of his <hi>bare-faced groates</hi> for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge; And also by certaine Grammatical quiddites, whilest as he maketh <hi>Verè,</hi> being ioyned with <hi>Celsus</hi> (as it signifieth a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name) to be no true Latine; and the translating of <hi>Praesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, Praeseruation,</hi> and not <hi>Defence,</hi> to be false English; and diuers other the like crotchets hath be inforced in this his new <hi>Reckoning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, there appeared a far greater fault, euen that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> whereby he chargeth me with no lesse then <hi>fifty wilfull fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods;</hi> as though he had learned of the <hi>Steward</hi> in the Gospell to <note n="g" place="margin">Luc. 16. v. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Sit downe and write fiftie,</hi> whom for that cause his Lord termed <hi>wise,</hi> but yet <hi>vniust,</hi> vniust to his Master, and wise for himselfe. Such <hi>vniust wisedome</hi> haue I found to abound in M.
<pb facs="tcp:13232:5"/>
               <hi>Parsons,</hi> who both in his booke of <hi>Mitigation,</hi> and in his new <hi>Reckoning</hi> obiecteth <hi>wilfull falshoods</hi> so vnconscionably, that he himselfe (as is proued in this <note n="h" place="margin">The margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall notes will point almost at euery one.</note> 
               <hi>Encounter</hi>) is intangled in farre more then <hi>fiftie witting</hi> (except some had rather I should say witlesse) <hi>vntruths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this kinde of dealing I haue more cause to complaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, then some others, because I finde strange measures offered vnto me by my Aduersaries. For M. <hi>Parsons</hi> his bent to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me hath beene such, as sometime to condemne me for omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wordes, which were by me expresly set downe; being in one place so violently transported with passiont, as to lay to my charge the word <hi>Fortasse,</hi> for not translating it, <hi>perhaps,</hi> although in the very same place I translated and englished it twise, <hi>Peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> which he could not but see, because once in the same place he repeated it accordingly: But it seemeth that in leuelling at me, as at his marke, he was onely left-eyed.</p>
            <p>Also (which is a profound step of malignity) he diuers times obiecteth for wilfull falsities the <hi>Omissions</hi> of such clauses, which, if they had beene alleadged to the full, might haue made much more for the aduantage of my cause. This was no more honest dealing then was that of the wife of <hi>Putiphar</hi> against <hi>Ioseph;</hi> He, for fear to bedrawnby her pulling him by the cloak to her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaste bedde, hastened away, and left his Cloake, a pledge and token of his chastitie: she, vpon his flight, cryeth out, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth that he came to abuse her, and for proofe she saith, <note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde his garment;</hi> turning the same Cloake contrarily into an argument of his villany, and a Cloake of her owne dishonesty.</p>
            <p>Againe, whereas vpon the finding out of mine owne Escapes, I gaue my Reader <hi>Aduertisments</hi> therof in the end of my books, and added <hi>Corrections</hi> thereunto; there my <note n="k" place="margin">The Romish Apologists in their second E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their Protestants A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of <hi>Delriꝰ</hi> And their Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Answerer in his late pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, about the legitimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Q. Mary</hi> and <hi>Q. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi>
               </note> Aduersaries (yet I cannot accuse M. <hi>Parsons</hi> of this guilt) being directed to my errour by mine owne Aduertisement, doe forthwith vpbraid mee with it, neuer giuing any notice that it hath beene corrected. So dealt the enemies of <hi>Sampson,</hi> who first <hi>plowed with his owne Heifer,</hi> then (which is spoken of the same men) <note n="l" place="margin">Iud. 10. 20.</note> 
               <hi>The Philistimes are vpon thee</hi> Sampson. I pray God that they fall not vpon the imprecation, which was extended vnto the imprecation, which was extended vnto the enemies of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who not regarding his repentaence for his fault, and the amendment
<pb facs="tcp:13232:6"/>
of his life, did point onely at his escape, saying, <hi>So, so would we haue it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet M. <hi>Parsons</hi> is in another point no lesse inexcuseble, whilst (which is his common guise) when foure or sixe, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times nine testimonies of his owne Authours are obiected against him, for matter of a point in Controuersie, he singleth out some one alleg ation, wherin he laboureth by art to make at least some shew and colour of misprision, and then dismisseth all the other witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses as dumbe men, and passeth ouer the whole cause it selfe without mention at all; and so diuers times <hi>Altercando res non dirimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, sed perimitur.</hi> Can this be a tollerable manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, in the disquisition of any truth? This is not all, but (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of late times) when our Aduersaries are muzzelled, as it were with the confessions of their owne Doctors, obiected for the iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our cause, they (as the AEgyptian Dogges are said to lappe here and there of the riuer <hi>Nilus,</hi> and runne their way) doe catch and snatch onely at peeces, and carpe at some allegations, crying out (although neuer so falsly) against <hi>Falshood,</hi> and then beholde <hi>The Booke,</hi> forsooth, <hi>is answered.</hi> In all these procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings they are, I confesse, <hi>in their generation, wise,</hi> but still <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust Aduersaries:</hi> And all uniust wisedome (we know) is before God iust nothing else, but miserable and damnable folly.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and lastly, by much wrastling we haue discouered two other euils, the one is an <hi>Hernia,</hi> euen the disposition of disloyaltie in very extraordinary maner brusting out, and betraying diuers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where euident Symptomes thereof: And the other is his <hi>Mentall Equiuocation,</hi> which we may call <hi>Alopecia;</hi> the rather because M. <hi>Parsons</hi> himselfe doth take an argument, for iustification of it, from the <hi>Foxe, which, by instinct of nature, can turne and skip forward and backward, to secure himselfe.</hi> Vpon which occasion I haue in one place intreated my Reader to accompany me in the <hi>Hunting of</hi> this <hi>Foxe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howbeit, thou maiest not imagine (good Reader) that this whole <hi>Encounter</hi> is spent in vying and reuying of imputed <hi>false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods,</hi> or in our wrastlings together, and laying one the other in the dust: but here are inserted many other points of better consequence; as first, An answere to their challenge, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> some Romanists to be <hi>

                  </gap>
               </hi> which is performed by
<pb facs="tcp:13232:6"/>
examples in their chiefest Writers, by the confessions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of their owne men; together with an acknowledgment of their art in corrupting of bookes. Secondly, an answere to the slaunders which <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine</hi> fasteneth vpon <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi> by imputing sundry <hi>Heresies</hi> vnto them. Thirdly, an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to a <hi>Challenge</hi> made by <hi>Mr. Parsons,</hi> concerning the Romish abuses of the testimonies of <hi>Fathers,</hi> for proofe of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi> and that by the confession of their owne Writers; which is amply discharged, both against the allegations of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> and of <hi>Iodocus Coccius.</hi> Fourthly, an answere to a late Pamphlet, intituled <hi>A patterne of a Protestant;</hi> wherein the Authour maketh himselfe the Patterne of an <hi>arrogant, ignorant, intemperate,</hi> and <hi>vnconscionable</hi> man. Fiftly, there are diuers large Tracts, in confutation of <hi>Mentall Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation;</hi> especially in the answere to his <hi>Appendix,</hi> wherein there is displayed the egregious forgery of an <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> in that memorable <hi>Yorke-shire case;</hi> together with a freeing of the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the Oracles of truth, from that prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he draweth vpon them, by pretending that they pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize this blacke art. Sixtly, and lastly (to omit many other important coincidents) their doctrine of <hi>Rebellion</hi> is handled; In consutation whereof (for this was the cause of all their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancy against me) I was contented to be condemned for a most false accuser of them, vpon condition that they by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents would not iustifie their former Assertions. But alas, still they set their <hi>Practizes</hi> as seales to their <hi>Positions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet as when Bees beginne to cast, men vse to throw vp dust in the aire, to hinder their sight, least they should flie from their homes, and set in some other place, so deale our Aduersaries; for whensoeuer by any not orious practise they become so obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as to cause their people to suspect their doctrin, and to incl. ne to our Profession: then, for staying of their departure, they in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy cast abroad in the ayre some forged Reports of some strange <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought in the honour of their cause; thus the fame of <hi>Garncts Straw</hi> was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <pb facs="tcp:13232:7"/>
            <p>I returne to my <hi>Encounter against Mr.</hi> Parsons <hi>his Recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> to let thee vnderstand (good Reader) that I haue vsed him more calmely then, (I will not say) my cause (for, alas, Who am I, that I may not be iniuried?) but peraduenture, then thou wilt thinke the <hi>Cause</hi> it selfe would permit: And especially in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry entrance into the Answere vnto his <hi>Appendix</hi> (when first I heard of any certainty of his death) the point of my Style did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, in a manner, to die with him; for so I thought it my duety, least I might seeme [<hi>Caeco scandalum</hi>] to deale too personally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, who could not answere for himselfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, to my owne selfe I say,</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Aug.</note> Non est intuendum quàm amarum, sed qùam falsum quod audio, &amp; quàm verax pro cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus nomine audio.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to my Aduersaries I say, that by their practises in carping at allegations, whilst they sought to put out the candles, they haue but topped them, and made them shine more clearely; as may euidently appeare by this <hi>Encounter.</hi> Notwithstanding, whosoeuer shall intend to <hi>Reply</hi> vnto this, or any other booke of mine, let him (if he expect to be answered) not carpe at peeces, but proceede soberly and orderly from point to point in the cause; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise I must say with the Apostle, <note n="n" place="margin">Galat. 6. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Let none put mee from henceforth vnto businesse.</hi>

In this then, if it please you, insist a while, and let Mr. <hi>Morton</hi> bring foorth in Print, any Catholicke Author that wrote against Protestants, since these heresies began, that hath beene taken in this impietie: I meane, that hath set downe in Print any such falsitie as cannot be excused either by ignorance, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, negligence, error of Print, translation, diuersitie of Editions, or the like: but that it must needs be presumed that he knew the vntruth, and yet would set it foorth; of this kind, I say, let him shew me but one example among all Catholicke Writers of our time, and I will in my Conscience greatly mistrust and discredite that Author, whether it be an other, or my selfe: but if he shew me two or three in any Writer in this kind, I shall be hardly able euer after to beleeue him more. And whereas the number and varietie of Catholicke Writers is so great, as the world seeth, it were no great labour to shew it in some, if that spirit doth raigne among them, as it doth among Protestant Writers.</p>

                        <p n="4">4.

He is not risen:</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is an affirmatiue, <hi>viz. His Disciples came and stole him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi> If any in regard of the negatiue part, had demaunded of them, saying, how know you that he is not risen? and heard them answer, saying, We know that hee did not rise, because <hi>We were asleepe;</hi> could he iudge this Aunswere to bee sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible?</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Thirdly, if we consider the affirmatiue part, <hi>His Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples him away,</hi> any might haue easily replied, saying, What his <hi>Disciples?</hi> They were the men, who for feare ranne away from him, when they should haue saued him from death, would they hazard themselues, for the stealing away his body after that he was dead? Improbable. And adde hereunto the reason taken from the <hi>wisedome</hi> of those worldlings, it will make their Aunswere incredible, because (as their <hi>Iansenius</hi> hath noted from Scripture) these beleeuers of the Souldiers were now deliuered vp into blindenesse; so that whilst they would seeme wise, they were found fooles. As for example: The <hi>Souldiers</hi> said they <hi>were asleep,</hi> &amp; perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men, that <hi>Christ is not risen;</hi> the Disciples of Christa while after professed, that they <hi>saw Christ,</hi> and preached that <hi>he is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen;</hi> yet these <hi>Scribes, Pharisees, Pilate</hi> and others (whom M. <hi>Parsons</hi> hath renouned with the title of <hi>wise, &amp; politique men</hi>) did rather beleeue Souldiers <hi>Sleeping,</hi> then the Apostles <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> And is not this also senselesse?

Now therefore let vs follow our Game.</p>
                     </div>

                        <p n="16">16. As for example. In this outward speech [<hi>I tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Popes Bull,</hi>] the word <hi>Bull</hi> is equiuocall, that is, of a double signification, equally betokening the Popes written
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:13232:32"/>
                           <hi>Bull,</hi> which is his publike instrument, vnder his seale of lead; or his natural <hi>Bull,</hi> which is an horned beast, feeding in his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures about <hi>Rauenna.</hi> It chaunceth that the Popes written <hi>Bull,</hi> which was publickely fastened vpon a pillar, for all the people of <hi>Rauenna</hi> to take notice of; was by some body rent and taken away: much questioning there is, who this partie might be; <hi>Sempronius</hi> is guiltie to himselfe of this trespasse: he is inquired after, concerning the <hi>Bull,</hi> by a seruant of his owne house, to whom he is not bound to make a direct aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, saying: <hi>Sir, did not you take away the Popes Bull?</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the written one. <hi>I took not</hi> (quoth he) <hi>the Popes Bul,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the fourefooted Bull. This later sense is true, and the speech (yea euen in Mr. <hi>Parsons</hi> his iudgement) is likewise true. Afterward the same <hi>Sempronius</hi> is demanded the same question by a competent Magistrate, vnto whom hee is bound to aunswere directly, and yet he maketh the same an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, <hi>I tooke not away the Popes Bull;</hi> in the same sense, as before, vnderstanding the horned Bull. And shall not this same sense haue the same truth? Shall it now become a lie? Impossible.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. For albeit, that the <hi>Obligation</hi> and <hi>Bond</hi> of duety, wherewith a man is tied to aunswere vnto the one directly, though not vnto the other, haue a force to alter the speech, which was lawfull, being spoken vnto the incompetent hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer (such as was his <hi>seruant,</hi>) to be vnlawfull, sinnefull, and damnable, when it was spoken to a Magistrate, iustly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining him, because the examinate is bound in conscience, not to delude the Magistrate, who is the Minister and Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of God in that businesse: yet this difference of <hi>Competent</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">A necessary distinction of truth.</note> and <hi>Incompetent,</hi> doth not chaunge a true speech into a lie. For there is a double kind of a true speech, the first is direct, the second indirect, as is plaine in the former <hi>Verball Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of the <hi>Bull,</hi> which being vnderstood of the naturall Bul, is a truth, because that word <hi>Bull</hi> in that sense agreed with the vnderstanding of the Speaker, but yet an indirect truth, because it accordeth not vnto the intention of the hearer. So that, that which Mr. <hi>Parsons</hi> calleth the <hi>principall difference,</hi>
                           <pb n="48" facs="tcp:13232:33"/>
consisting in being <hi>Bound,</hi> or <hi>not Bound,</hi> is nothing else but the singular fallacie of Mr. <hi>Parsons,</hi> by confounding of two truths, and by not distinguishing an indirect trueth from a lie.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. To make this yet more familiar vnto my Reader.

As for example: <hi>I am no Priest,</hi> mixed with this clause conceiued in mind, <hi>To tell it you,</hi> is as true, in the iudgement of <hi>P. R.</hi> as if it had beene
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:13232:33"/>
without Reseruation fully expressed with the mouth, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I am no Priest, to tell it you. Now then, Say <hi>P.

If the clause of Reseruation might haue made it a truth, then hath not <hi>P.

For if she had said vnto Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in plaine words, <hi>I haue sold it but for so much, to giue it in common,</hi> or such like, this euery one knoweth had beene a true speech: yet the saying, <hi>I sold it for so much,</hi> with mentall Reseruation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing in her mind. <hi>to giue it in common,</hi> Or, <hi>To tell it vnto you,</hi> was, notwithstanding this Reseruation. euen by the  iudgement of <hi>P.

                        <p>IT is euident that the womans proposition, that shehad sold her land <note place="margin">Reckon. pa. 107.</note> for no more, with Obligation to giue it vnto Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> or, to be

                        <p n="21">21. Marke now (good Reader) for we now come to vncouch this creature:) It was supposed that the woman said, <hi>I solde it but for so much,</hi> reseruing in her minde, <hi>To giue into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon purse,</hi> Or, <hi>To tell it vnto you,</hi> that is, but for so much, with any purpose to tell vnto you, or, to giue in common: which wordes if they had beene deliuered with the mouth, had (as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one seeth) beene most true. Now Mast. <hi>Parsons</hi> finding himselfe driuen to an extremity, putteth into her <hi>Reseruation</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">M. <hi>Parsons</hi> piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full plunge.</note> the word, <hi>Bond,</hi> or, <hi>Obligation,</hi> as though she had aunswered thus: <hi>I sold it but for so much,</hi> with this Reseruation, <hi>So as bound to tell it vnto you,</hi> Or, <hi>With Obligation to giue in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> inserting the word <hi>Bound,</hi> in her Reseruation, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliuered with the mouth, maketh a false speech: for shee could not say without a lie, that shee was not <hi>bound</hi> to tell S. <hi>Peter</hi> what she sould it for. And thus Mr. <hi>Parsons</hi> hath altred the whole subiect of the Question, falsly supposing a Reserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which vttered with the mouth is false; and that witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because he euen in this <hi>Reckoning,</hi> where he repeateth the State of this question, as it was first laid downe by me, confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

                              </gap> in the outward speech.</hi> But now, by instancing in that proposition, which is in the outward speech, a flat lie. Thus, as we see, <hi>M. Parsons</hi> hath changed the point in question, which is the most absurd and base kinde of Sophistry that can be vsed.</p>
                        <p n="22">22. This may appeare by a like example. Two Disputants are met together, the question to bee decided is, Whether it may be lawfull to licence <hi>Titius</hi> to haue a Concubine (by <hi>Concubine</hi> vnderstanding a Woman, <hi>who is not his married <note place="margin">An example.</note> wife.)</hi> After much debating of the question, the Answerer is so miserably plunged, as, for his last Refuge, to say, that he onely desended it to be lawfull to licence <hi>Titius</hi> to enioy a <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine,</hi> to whom he, <note n="i" place="margin">For thus doth Bellarm. vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the word l. 2. dc Conc. c. 8. S. 11.</note>, is <hi>married.</hi> Would not the hearer abhorre or scorne such Sophistrie as this, whereby the Question about a woman vnmaried, is changed into the Question concerning a married wife?</p>
                        <p n="23">23. Yet thus dealeth M. <hi>Parsons</hi> with mee in this present Example: For our question was of a speech, vsed in mentall Reseruation, which being vttered with the mouth, is a true speech, as when a man shall say to a competent Magistrate, <hi>I know no such thing, with any purpose to tell it vnto you:</hi> This, I say, is a <note n="k" place="margin">
                              <q>I am no Priest such as I should be, Or such as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be, Or  the like.</q>
Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigat. c. 8. num. 55. p. 344.</note> true speech, when it is wholly and fully vttered with the mouth: and of this kinde of speech is our question pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, as M. <hi>Parsons</hi> himselfe knew right well; yet now hath he turned it, as if he had said thus, <hi>I know no such thing, as bound to tell it unto you,</hi> which spoken vnto a lawfull Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, is certainely a lying speech.</p>
                        <p n="24">24. If M. <hi>Parsons</hi> vse to change the question in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he may dispute indeede, but like a vaine man, who onely beateth the ayre: And if I should follow him in this course, we might well be represented by that Embleme of <hi>one man milking an hee Goate, and another holding vnder a siue,</hi> resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling <note place="margin">A simile.</note> two such Disputers, whereof the one obiecteth nothing to the purpose, and the other aunswereth hee knoweth not what.</p>

                           <pb n="53" facs="tcp:13232:35"/>25. Although he be now in our handes, yet will we bee content to giue him more play, and trie if hee in another course can shift for himselfe. To this end I will yeeld so farre vnto M. <hi>Parsons,</hi> as to suppose with him that the <hi>Reseruation</hi> which the woman made, was such as he hath now pretended, to wit, [<hi>I sold it but for so much</hi>] reseruing in her minde <hi>as bound to tell it vnto you</hi> and also that <hi>No clause of reseruation could saue this her speech from a lie:</hi> All which being graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet doe I now auerre as confidently as before, that this second Position is the ouerthrowe of his whole defence of <hi>Mentall Reseruation,</hi> as will now appeare.</p>

                        <p n="26">26. After that M. <hi>Parsons</hi> had <note n="l" place="margin">Reckon. p. 113.</note> confessed such a <hi>Reseruation</hi> 
                           <note n="l" place="margin">Reckon. p. 113.</note> of the woman, <hi>which no clause of a second</hi> reseruation can saue from a lie, and thereupon was challenged to graunt, that the manner of a Romish Priests reseruation is likewise a lie, and so the tricke of Mentall Reseruation to bee but a lying de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise: He had no other refuge in the world, but to forge a manner of <hi>Reseruation</hi> of his owne, by putting in the worde <hi>Bound,</hi> as if the woman had answered, <hi>I sold it but for so much,</hi> conceiuing in her minde, <hi>As bound to tell it vnto you.</hi> Which speech he calleth a lie, and saith, that no clause of Reseruation can saue it from a lie.</p>
                        <p n="27">27. Now therefore I am to pose M. <hi>Parsons,</hi> and if he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere this, I shall not call a Mentall <hi>AE</hi> quiuocatora lyar. My question is this: If vnto that proposition [<hi>I sold it but for so much, as bound to tell it vnto you,</hi> she had added such clauses as these, saying, <hi>I solde it but for so much, as bound to tell it vnto you (Saint Peter) meaning, As you are a priuate man: Or, As bound to tell it vnto you, meaning, with any intent to kill you: Or, as bound to tell it vnto you,</hi> meaning [<hi>with any desire to steale a mans cloake:</hi> and a thousand such like additions to the former clause of Reseruation: My question is, I say, whether euerie one of these additions doe make the supposed speech of the woman true or no? For if the womans speech standing thus,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13232:36"/>
                           <hi>I sold it but for so much, as bound to tell it vnto you</hi> (by reseruing further in minde) <hi>as you are a priuate man;</hi> make not the speech true, then is there not any case of Reseruation, which is not a <note place="margin">The miserable straights of Mr. <hi>Parsons</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</note> lie, and so farewell all <hi>Mentall Reseruation:</hi> but if those clauses being added to her speech, doe make the first clause true, then hath Master <hi>Parsons</hi> deceiued vs, in saying that her speech was such, <hi>Which no clause of Reseruation could free from a lie.</hi> This being the maine and substantial point, indeede, I craue leaue to conuince M. <hi>Parsons</hi> by another Argument.</p>

                        <head>A fourth Reason, which is taken from his owne descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mentall Equiuocation.</head>
                        <p n="28">28.
<q>We will leaue the womans supposed manner of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation, <hi>and argue from</hi> M. Parsons <hi>his description of</hi> Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Equiuocation. <note n="m" place="margin">Mitig c. 8. n. 55. p. 344.</note> I say (<hi>saith M.</hi> Parsons) that in Mentall Reseruation the speech agreeth with the minde of the Speaker, for that I truely and really meane, that I am no Priest, in the sense which I speake it, which may be what pleaseth me, or that which I lust to frame to my selfe, so as I mean, I am no Priest,  such as I should be, or such like.</q>
Here M. <hi>Parsons</hi> (speaking in the person of an Equiuocating Priest) doth tell vs, he may make a <hi>Mentall Reseruation of any thing that pleaseth him, or what he list to frame</hi> in his imagination: so that it <hi>doth agree with his minde,</hi> which is as liberal a graunt, as I could require.</p>
                        <p>Now then let M. <hi>Parsons</hi> thinke with himselfe that some Priest is called in question before the Pope, by whom hee is asked, Whether he kept a Concubine, or no? The Priest al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he kept a Concubine, yet answereth the Pope, saying [<hi>I haue kept no Concubine</hi>] reseruing in his minde [<hi>for the vse</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">An example.</note> 
                           <hi>of your Holinesse.</hi>] I would be so much beholden vnto Master <hi>Parsons,</hi> as to tell me, whether the Priest lyed in his Answer, or no? And so we shall make a short Reckoning.</p>
                        <p n="29">29. He hath told vs, that all indirect Reseruation in a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full question, and before a competent Iudge, is a lie: because of an Obligation and <hi>Bond,</hi> which the partie hath to answere directly: he hath said also that whensoeuer Mentall Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13232:36"/>
is true in the mind, it is as true, being vttered with the mouth. Wherefore if hee shall aunswere, that the Priests <hi>Mentall Equiuocation</hi> was no lie, then is he compellable to forsake his last refuge of <hi>Bond</hi> and <hi>Obligation to a competent Iudge,</hi> which he said doth make the speech a lie. But if hee aunswere that the Priests Reseruation in the minde was a lie, which (as is apparant) being fully declared with the mouth, is not a lie, then doth not the mentall Clause of Reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation make a true mixt proposition, and consequently his maine ground of Mentall Equiuocation is quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen.</p>
                        <p n="30">30. Finally the summe of all this is thus much, that if the same speech, which being vttered fully with the mouth, is true; shall (as it is mixed with Reseruation of the mind) bee <note place="margin">The desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Mr. <hi>Parsons</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</note> iudged a lie: then Mentall Reseruation and the Doctrine thereof is an Art of lying. But if that reseruation make the proposition true, then the <hi>Bond</hi> of speaking directly to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent iudge, cannot make the speech a lie: And so his last Euasion by <hi>an Obligation to tell a truth,</hi> is a false and lying As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion. So that if he will but looke againe to his legges, he shall finde the <hi>Shacles</hi> of his owne Confessions to sticke so fast to his heeles, as although he be the most nimble heeled of all his Order, yet hee shall neuer bee able to shake them off. Thus much may serue for this present, concerning <hi>Mentall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocation.</hi> We shall adde other conuictions in their due and proper places.</p>
                        <p n="31">31. In the <hi>Interim</hi> I am to satisfie for my selfe, because Mr. <note n="n" place="margin">Reckon. p. 103.</note> 
                           <hi>Parsons</hi> obiecteth against me a contradiction forsooth, for that I called the woman, vnto whom Saint <hi>Peter</hi> sware, an <hi>Examiner incompetent;</hi> and yet else-where say that the same <hi>Mayd was competent enough, to heare a true Oath.</hi> Vpon these two strings of <hi>Contradiction</hi> (as they may seeme to be) he maketh himselfe Musicke, by a meere cauillation.

His drift is to argue <hi>Bellarmine</hi> of falsitie, for affirming that <hi>Protestants</hi> of our dayes doe ioyne with the old Heretickes, the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatians,</hi> in taking from the Church <hi>All power of reconciling men vnto God,</hi> for these are <hi>Bellarmines</hi> words, and to contradict <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hee citeth the words of <hi>Alphonsus de Castro,</hi> saying that the heresie, &amp;c. But these are not contrary: for the <hi>Nouatians</hi> taught both points, principally that ther was no power in the Church to reconcile them, who fell after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, especially into grieuous sinnes, as testifieth <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> and others; and this first part was against the keyes of the Church and power to remit sinnes, and herein all Authors doe agree. But the second part of this error went further, as some doe gather out of the auncient Fathers, as testifieth <hi>Suarez</hi> (although others be of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry opinion) which was to denie furthermore, besides the Sacrament, all vertue of Penance whatsoeuer, whether priuate or Sacramentall. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth not ascribe vnto Protestants the deniall of priuate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, either inward, or outward, by sorrow and teares, but their deniall of Penance, as it is a Sacrament. And for M. <hi>Morton</hi> to inferre that forasmuch as <hi>Alphonsus de Castro</hi> saith, that the <hi>Nauatians</hi> did denie all power of Penance, therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> said not truly, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Sacramentall vse thereof, is a most absurd manner of reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, called <hi>à disparatis,</hi> for both may be true, the one excludeth not the other.</p>

of your owne Authours <hi>Castro, Vega, Maldonate,</hi> that they, in censuring the errour of the <hi>Nouatians,</hi> did neuer note this to be the <hi>Nouatians</hi> heresie, <hi>viz.</hi> [<hi>The deniall of Penance to be a Sacrament.</hi>] Neither could you, M. <hi>Parsons,</hi> proue this out <note place="margin">M. <hi>Parsons</hi> frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</note> of any one of them, albeit you haue giuen your diligence to finde it out.

This is now properly to helpe a Die indeed: for that <hi>Senensis</hi> doth not talke of any such <hi>euidence of the contexts,</hi> but speaketh rather doubtfully, and by coniecture, saying of <hi>Origen,</hi> that his opinion (that both good and bad should be purged by fire) is confuted by S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his bookes <hi>de Ciust.

                        <p n="6">6. I said indeed that <hi>Senensis</hi> by the euidence of contexts acknowledged the testimonies alleaged, to haue spoken of the fire of the day of iudgment, and consequently (according vnto <hi>Bellarmines</hi> doctrine) not of the <hi>fire of Purgatory.</hi> This you call <hi>Shifting, Lying,</hi> and <hi>helpint the Die;</hi> but the perfect Cogger will presently appeare. For first I alleaged diuers te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies, which might haue licensed me in a generalitie to say <hi>by the euidence of contexts,</hi> seeing that M. <hi>Parsons</hi> could take exception but onely to one.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. And the truth is, that I cyted <hi>Senensis</hi> his <hi>Biblioth.</hi> l. 5. <hi>Annot.</hi> 171. who writeth thus: <hi>Ambrose seemeth to agree with</hi> Origen, <hi>who saith that all (Christ onely excepted) must be tried, and, in a sort, burnt in the fire of the conflagration of Gods iudgement:</hi> Where <hi>Senensis</hi> expresly affirmeth, what his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is concerning the sentence of <hi>Origen.</hi> To confure this <note place="margin">M. <hi>Parsons</hi> fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in falshood.</note> M. <hi>Parsons</hi> setcheth a skip out of <hi>Senensis, Annot.</hi> 171. backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vnto his <hi>Annot.</hi> 170. where <hi>Senesis</hi> saith of <hi>Origen, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de an. &amp;c.</hi> O confuter! <hi>Origen</hi> spake of a <hi>fire</hi> thorow which Apostles, Martyrs, and euery one, <hi>Except Christ,</hi> must passe. So that this could not bee the Romish Purgatory-fire, for neither <hi>Senensis,</hi> nor any Romanist durst euer say, that Saints and Martyrs did euer take their voyage vnto heauen by hell. Thus then the [<hi>Vide</hi>] of <hi>Senensis</hi> bringeth no doubt in the cause, for it is stil plain by the contexts, that by it is not meant your <hi>Purgatory-fire.</hi>

Mary?</hi> As for the Answere made by <hi>Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> it is nothing but his vnseasonable figment: For where was it euer heard, that any State put a man to death for heresie, whom they might cut off for treason? For although <note place="margin">M. <hi>Sanders</hi> odd euasion, about Heresie and Treason.</note> heresie be a more heynous crime, yet the Hereticke recanting is receiued againe into fauor: but a Traytor notwithstanding his repentance, is to giue satisfaction of the law, by suffering death. The Church dealeth as a Mother, the law as a Iudge. Neyther can the former Answere consist with Christian poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: for if a man be both a Traytor and an Hereticke, it would be lesse preiudiciall vnto Religion, to execute him for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, then for his opinion, because euen the ashes of but one burnt for an Hereticke, doth breede some wormes of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:13232:98"/>
Finally, common wit and vnderstanding of a man will teach him, that whosoeuer is both guilty of heresie and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, he should be accused and conuicted of them both, that by the heynousnesse of his Treason, his Heresie might seeme <note place="margin">M. <hi>Parsons</hi> poore shift.</note> more odious.

                           <hi>Yes</hi> (say you) <hi>for that I truely meane that I am no Priest in the sense which I speake it, which may be what pleaseth me.</hi> This being the very <hi>Besis</hi> and foundation of your doctrine of <hi>Mentall Equiuo cation,</hi> I now make bold to auerre, that euery such speech, in the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Sepulueda,</hi> is a lie.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. For so he censureth euery such kinde of reserued clause, where the <note n="e" place="margin">Sepulueda de ration. dicendi tellimon. cap. 3. pag. 468.</note> obiection is made concerning one, who is called in question by a Iudge to bewray another mans secrecie, which he ought not to reueale, and shall answer thus, [<hi>I know nothing of it,</hi>] <hi>keeping this reseruation in minde,</hi> [<hi>As bound to tell it vnto you.</hi>] Here we finde a mixt proposition, part in word, and part in minde; secondly, here the Iudge is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent, demanding that which the party is not bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale; thirdly, here your Clause of Reseruation is the same, wherein you principally insist: so that if this be not lawfull, you must necessarily faile in your former defence. Come we now to our Authour <hi>Sepulueda.</hi> Vnto this obiection of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letus</hi> and <hi>louer of himselfe,</hi> he opposeth his owne iudgement in the name of <hi>Theophilus,</hi> that is, <hi>A louer of God,</hi> saying, <note n="f" place="margin">Ibid. cap. 5. pag. 471.</note>

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:13232:111"/>
in the end concludeth, concerning the former Aequiuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>That the speech is a lie, because the signification therof doth dissent from that which lieth secret in the minde: for thou sayest</hi> (saith he) <hi>that</hi> [<hi>thou knowest nothing at all thereof</hi>] <hi>and euery one that heareth thee, doth so vnderstand thee, notwithstan ding thou art guilty to thy selfe, that thou doost know it, although with purpose not to reueale it.</hi>

                        <p n="5">5.

(saith Azorius) <hi>is not that which some doe yeeld, saying that it is lawfull, when we sweare, to take the wordes in our sense, which we feine vnto our selues, and not in the sense, which the hearers doe vnderstand.</hi> Yet is this the reason which <hi>M. Parsons</hi> hath <note place="margin">

                        <p n="18">18. This may be made plaine by comparing examples to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. A Iudge is acquainted with a mans cause, which he <note place="margin">An Example.</note> is to determine; the party, whose cause it is, commeth to the Iudge for aduife: Now it is knowne that a Iudge is not to giue counsaile in any case, wherein he is to execute the office of a Iudge: yet the party being instant and vrgent, saying, <hi>Sir, doe you not know how I shall free my selfe in this cause;</hi> the Iudge answereth, <hi>Friend, I know nothing of this matter:</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that howsoeuer, as he is a Lawyer, he know his cause, yet now, as a Iudge, he is not to acknowledge it: And this double sense is in the speech it selfe, and, by circumstance of the person, may possibly be apprehended by any discreet hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer: and is to be called <hi>a Verball AEquiuocation,</hi> according vnto the former definition, which <hi>M.

                        </p>
                        <p n="19">19. Such like is the example, which <hi>Azorius</hi> hath offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red concerning a <hi>Priest,</hi> who knoweth some secret reuealed
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:13232:115"/>
vnto him in priuate Confession, as he is a Priest, and therefore <hi>as a Priest</hi> is bound in conscience and by his calling, not to reueale any such secrecie (except the concealement may be pernitiously damnifiable vnto persons, and States, as some of them doe hold): In such a case <hi>Azorius</hi> saith, that hee may answere, <hi>I know not, because he knoweth it not but as a Priest,</hi> which is, that <hi>he knoweth it not, to reueale it:</hi> but why? by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of an <hi>Onely reseruation mentall?</hi> (so hath Mr. <hi>Parsons</hi> defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned): No, but because, as <hi>Azorius</hi> saith, <hi>The wordes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,</hi> according to their vfe, haue this ambiguous significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in themselues: so that it is not now to be called absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mentall, but a verball Ambiguity.</p>

                        <p n="32">32. By this it is manifest, that taking the same example of <hi>denying that I haue it,</hi> with reseruation, [<hi>To lend or to giue it,] Azorius</hi> matcheth it with the vilest kind of lying, saying that, if this kind of speech be true, <hi>there is nothing so false, which may not be freed from a lie.</hi> And in the end, (concerning the same obiection) he answereth by the fift Rule, saying, (as wee haue heard) <hi>That if the wordes, which wee vse, be not ambiguous in</hi>

But <hi>Mr. Morton</hi> let me pose you here: Is it true that your Aduersary said so farre, and no further to the purpose in hand? Or is it not rather true that you cut him off, and would not suffer him to say any further? for your Aduersary did fully cleare the matter, if you would haue suffered him to tellon his tale, for these are his wordes: [<hi>Whereby it is manifest that all Catholikes doe not allow of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocation,

As for his illustrious Lordship (<hi>meaning</hi> Cardinall Bellarmine:) he erreth, first by not distinguishing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <note place="margin">Bellarmine <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filius.</note> the Title of authority, and the authority it selfe, (<hi>An e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident conuiction both of</hi> Bellarmine <hi>and</hi> M.

Secondly, he erreth in saying that all, which dwellwithin the Princes territories, are not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from God Subiects vnto him, and yet all Christians are immediately subiect vnto the Pope; for as the Prince is not a Prince without either right of his birth, or by election, &amp;c. So the Pope is not Pope but by the election of Cardinals. Thirdly, he erreth in saying that when the Prince dieth, the authority re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in the common-wealth; especially, where as the succession is by election; but when the Pope dieth the power Papall remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not in the Cardinals, who are to make an election, nor in the Church; But the Doctors of the famous College of the Sorbonists in Paris doe defend the contrary. Fourthly, he erreth in making this difference betweene Prince and Pope, to wit, that the Title of the Prince is but mediately, and the Title of the Pope is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:13232:132"/>
from God; if by the Title, he vnderstand the manner of obtaining the authority, he erreth: for both the manner of the one, and of the other are equally humane, neither will the Concla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uists themselues suffer me to be conuinced of a lye in this point. <hi>Thus farre their owne</hi> Marsilius.</p>

kill vs, if you had vs in your power, or no? thought it was not for his purpose to answere no, for then must hee condemne their Romish positions and practises, which haue sounded out so many allarums of warre and bloodshed; neyther durst he say yea, for then he must recant his former booke of <hi>Miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> and cancell the summe of this his present <hi>Reckoning,</hi> which doth make, at least, some semblance of a <hi>peaceable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation;</hi> and therefore he thought it a point of wisedome to call it <hi>foolish,</hi> as though he would teach vs to be as wise as <hi>doues,,</hi> whilst he and his Complices may remaine as innocent as <hi>Serpents.</hi> Here <hi>M.

                           <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> saith that the counersion of the bread into the bodie of Christ, is not wrought by <hi>production</hi> of the bodie of Christ out of the bread, but by <hi>Adduction</hi> of the bodie vnto the bread: Some Romish Authours appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending this position of <hi>Adduction,</hi> did plainely conclude against <hi>Bellermine</hi> his conclusion, saying that so it shall not

The first: because the old Imperiall lawes made by the Gentiles were then in vse, whereby all great meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of people were forbidden, for feare of sedition, except by the Emperours knowledge and licence. The second, because the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors being then Lords of the whole world, the Councels could not be made in any city, without their leaue. The third, for that the Councels being made in those dayes by publike charges and contributions of cities, and especially of Christian Emperours themselues, it was necessarie to haue their consent and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13232:151"/>
in so publike an action. And the fourth and last cause, for that in those dayes, albeit the Bishop of Rome were head in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall matters ouer the Emperours themselues, yet in temporall affaires he did subiect himself vnto them, as hauing no temporall state of his owne, and therefore acknowledging them to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Lords, he did make supplication vnto them, to command Synods to be gathered by their authoritie and licence. But since those times (saith Bellarmine) <hi>Omnes iste causae mutatae sunt</hi> All those causes were changed, The Pope himselfe being now a temporall all Lord also, as other Kings and Princes are, which was brought to passe (saith he) by Gods prouidence, that he might haue more freedome and libertie to exercise his Pastorship.</p>

Was not Manna a figure of the Eucharist, and Circumcision a signe of our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme? And Saint Paul. 1. Cor. 9. applieth that of Deut. 25.

                        <p n="1">1 I answere, that some of these Instances were ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, <note place="margin">Ceremonies of the old law how figures of the new.</note> and some examples of Gods extraordinarie punishments. For the first, I denie not, but that <hi>Circumcision, Manna,</hi> and the <hi>Rock</hi> were types, and had analogie with the Sacraments, which are <hi>antitypa,</hi> and both conspire together in one <hi>Christ,</hi> as the <hi>archetypon</hi> of all, and therefore both are spirituall: for the which cause the Apostle sheweth of the Israelites that they in their Elements <note n="a" place="margin">1.

                           <hi>Eate the same spirituall meat, and dranke the same spirituall drinke,</hi> meaning <hi>Christ;</hi> which was, as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> expoundeth it, <hi>The same which we do,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Christ.</hi>

And as touching the third, we may say that the diuerse mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous iudgements of God in former time vpon <hi>Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Murmurers,</hi> and <hi>Idolaters</hi> in Israel, are figures vnto the after-Christian world, that if wee finde not the like visible vengeances. yet are we taught to make true consequences from them, to wit; that if we dwell securely in like sinnes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we feele not the like outward plagues, yet wee shall be sure to bee tormented in the end, because the <hi>God,</hi> who hath beene iust visibly, will bee euerlastingly iust, to punish transgressions and sinnes.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 In the next place hee exaggerateth this difference of translation, to wit, <hi>The old Testament is a figure of the new in Christ,</hi> in stead of this (as <hi>M.

Admirall,</hi> which second L. a simple fellow interpreted to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Lady Admirall, saying that the first L. signifying the Lord himselfe, the second L. must needs signifie also his Lady. If I misse in this coniecture or comparison, S.

Francis his sleeue:</hi> but if we beleeue <hi>Sotus,</hi> that sleeue is too short to hide so long a lie: for <note n="i" place="margin">Ibid. p. 318.</note> 
                           <hi>This deuice (saith he) will not content me, because although he that is vniustly asked a question, be not bound to answer vnto the intention of the deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, yet is he bound to hide a secrecy in such words, which are true in a sense which is receiued either among the people, or else among wise and discreet men.</hi> Heere <hi>Sotus</hi> iudgeth a Mentall Reseruation, agreeing with the minde of the speaker, to be no better than a lie, euen because the outward speech will not carry the secret sense, in the vnderstanding of discreet hearers. Which is the whole and onely point, which in my dispute against the Romish AEquiuocation I vndertooke to prooue. And lest that any might thinke that their AEqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocating deuice were any way sanctified by touch, as it were, of <hi>S. Frances</hi> his <hi>sleeue, Sotus</hi> opposeth against that a contrary example out of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> as followeth.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 <hi>An other example.</hi> 
                           <note n="k" place="margin">Ibid.</note> S. Augustine reporteth another example: There was a Bishop (saith he) whose name was <hi>Firme,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample out of S.

                           <hi>If (saith</hi> Sotus) <hi>he cannot finde words, whereby, through an Equiuocation, which is in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vse of men, he may couer his fault without a lie, he ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die than lie.</hi> Still we finde, that whatsoeuer the AEqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation be, it ought to be such as consisteth in the common vse of the words themselues.

A King, saith <hi>Royard,</hi> must not be obeied, when he commandeth any thing contrary vnto godlinesse, which (saith <hi>M.

                           <hi>Whether it be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to obey God or man, iudge you:</hi> yet did they not teach the people to reiect such Commanders, and to holde them for no Magistrates. And <hi>Royard</hi> in this place, now cited by <hi>M. Parsons,</hi> insisteth in the fact of <hi>S.

Parsons,</hi> but I doubt he wil stumble vpon it, and fal &amp; breake his forehead. It should bee this: If the Popeshould
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13232:169"/>
command him any thing, which is directly against Gods commandement, would <hi>M. Parsons</hi> obey him? He would not, for then he should make the Pope his God: but in not <note place="margin">A Dilemma.</note> obeying him, would he seeke to <hi>depose him?</hi> He would not; for he hath taught, that for wickednesse of maners the Pope may not be iudged by any.

But the Equiuocators are refined falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficators, for that they may auoide the infamy of a lie, which must needs be in two contradictory propositions, they haue inuented a tricke, to put two propositions in one, as thus, the mouth saying, <hi>I will giue thee it</hi> (which he inteudeth not to giue, and supplieth in his mind) <hi>but onely in conceit,</hi> or such a like clause, which he shall fancy to himselfe.

                        </head>
                        <p>Ireceiued, gentle Reader, not long since by a letter of the eight <note place="margin">Reckon pa. 671</note> of Nouember Anno. 1608. from a friend of minc dwelling in the North parts of <hi>England,</hi> acertaine Aduertisment about a case of Equiuocation fallen out in those parts, wherein my said friende requested my iudgement, whether the same were tollerable, or excusable, or not? And for that it seemed he had some right to vrge me in the matter, in respect of the Trcatise written by me of that argument against <hi>M. Morton</hi> I thought my selfe the more bound to yeeld him some satisfaction to his demand.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="part">
                        <head>The Reuiew, discouering the forgery of this Case by foure probabilities, taken out of M. PARSONS his <hi>Exordium.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p n="3">3 Because this case is made so notorious, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation thereof, if it be true, must needes bewray exceeding mischiefe on the side, or else on the other side extreame malice, if it shall appeare to be false: I shall intreate thee (<hi>Good Reader</hi>) to obserue and ponder the circumstances of this <hi>Preface,</hi> which <hi>M. Parsons</hi> hath commended vnto thee; and to consider, first, <hi>Who</hi> it is that inquireth whether this pretended <hi>Equiuocation</hi> be <hi>Tollerable,</hi> or not? <hi>M. Parsons</hi> hath tould vs that he is his <hi>Friend;</hi> and in that (according to his profession) great friend vnto any Protestant. Is it not therefore altogether improbable, that his conscience should be so tenderly scrupulous about that which was his aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries sinne, and none of his owne?</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Secondly consider <hi>What</hi> the doubt and difficulty is, which the <hi>Friend</hi> of <hi>M. Parsons</hi> doth desire so earnestly to be decided: The only thing that he would know (poore soule) is, whether when a lawfull Magistrate proceedeth iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:13232:202"/>
in examination vpon Oath, it may be held <hi>Tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> for any to abuse and delude this Iudge by <hi>Equiuocating</hi> in Oath, or no? But shal we thinke that <hi>M. Parsons</hi> his <hi>friend</hi> or any Christian would make question and doubt whether that be <hi>Tollerable,</hi> which euery conscience of man, yea of the very Pagans, by the onely light and instinct of Nature, can presently condemne as most <hi>intollerable?</hi> Would he haue vs to thinke that his <hi>Friend</hi> could be so sottish as to make que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion about a point so vtterly vnquestionable?</p>
                        <p n="5">5 Thirdly, <hi>Whither</hi> now will his <hi>Friend</hi> trauell for meanes to remoue this great perplexity? We see that he now posteth ouer the <hi>Alpes</hi> as far as <hi>Rome,</hi> by his letters, for satisfaction in this case. But what? <hi>Is there no balme in Gilead?</hi> Is there no sufficient Counsaile in any Iesuit, or secular Priest within <hi>England,</hi> that can resolue this so silly and sencelesse a doubt? and to vntwine so loose a thred? shall we thinke this probable?</p>
                        <p n="6">6<hi>Lastly, when all is done,</hi> Whome <hi>will the good man make choise of in</hi> Rome, <hi>for the deteiminer of this point? whom, but his friend</hi> M. Parsons? <hi>and good reason, because</hi> 
                           <note n="*" place="margin">Reckon. See aboue.</note> It seemed (<hi>saith</hi> M. Parsons) that he had some right to vrge me in this matter, in respect of the Treatise written by me of that matter against <hi>M. Morton,</hi> and I thought my selfe the more bound to yeeld him some satisfaction to his demand. <hi>But how could his</hi> Friend <hi>be ignorant of</hi> M. Parsons <hi>his iudgement in such a Case? We may trie this by his last Conclusion.</hi> 
                           <note n="a" place="margin">Reckon p. 674.</note> I doe infer (<hi>saith</hi> M. Parsons) for resolution of the case, that this was no true, or proper Equiuocation at all, but rather a flat lie. and open perinry; as by that we haue treated before with <hi>M. Morton</hi> in the second chapter of this booke may appeare more largely: but much more throughout diuers Chapters together in my former Treatiss of Mitigation. <hi>Let vs put his former</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>M. Parsons</hi> conuicted by his owne mouth.</note> 
                           <hi>Reason and this Conclusion together, and hence I</hi> infer <hi>a notable absurditie, viz. that</hi> Master Parsons <hi>his</hi> Friend <hi>must bethought to haue sent many hundred miles vnto</hi> M. Parsons, <hi>to answer a doubt by his letters, which he</hi>
                           <pb n="115" facs="tcp:13232:202"/>
had <hi>largely</hi> and sufficiently vnfoulded and assoiled publikely by his booke a yeere before.</p>

                        <p n="36">36 Knowing therefore that the Equiuocations, which haue beene obiected by <hi>M.

                        <p n="16">16 And here I appeale vnto the indifferencie of any iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader, to iudge, whether <hi>M. Parsons</hi> be not guiltie of the folly and impiety, which I had laid vnto his charge, by the force of this distinction, of a sence <hi>Implied</hi> in speeches, &amp; a sence ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely <hi>Reserued in the minde:</hi> the first kinde I graunt to be, if he will, more then a thousand times vsed in Scripture; but the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of his maner of <hi>Reserued</hi> could neuer finde any <hi>Iota</hi> in all Scripture, to countenance so vile a deuice. Which although I haue confuted by many Reasons, yet now I will aduenture to turne his owne weapon vpon him. First thus:</p>
                        <p n="17">17 If the <hi>Reseruation,</hi> which he defendeth, be not to be pious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lawfully vsed in <hi>matters of faith,</hi> then was it an <hi>impietie</hi> in him, to ground the truth of that doctrin vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sentences of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which concerne the doctrine of faith. Secondly thus:</p>
                        <p n="18">18 If I should passe through all the Articles of our Creed, to search such kind of <hi>Reseruations,</hi> as <hi>M. Parsons</hi> did in the spce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Christ,</hi> as namely thus, first I, meaning <hi>I,</hi> a man, &amp; not a woman, 2. <hi>Beleeue,</hi> meaning truly, and not fainedly; 3. <hi>in God,</hi> meaning the God of Christians, &amp; not the Idoll of the Pagans; 4. <hi>the Father,</hi> meaning, by adoption, and not by naturall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; 5. <hi>Almighty,</hi> meaning, that can doe whatsoeuer he will, not that will doe whatsoeuer he can; 6. <hi>maker of heauen, and earth,</hi> meaning, with his word, &amp; not with any hands: so might I passe throughout euery Article of our Christian Creed, to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect from euery ioynt, &amp; word therof, all such like vnexpressed meanings, as <hi>M. Parsons</hi> did from the speeches of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="19">19 Here I may argue thus: If all such sentences, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the custome and vse imply meanings, which are not expressed, do exemplifie and proue the Romish <hi>Mentall Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation,</hi> then is there a <hi>Mentall Reseruation</hi> in euery Article of our Faith; and so it is vnp ossible but to Equiuocate <hi>mentally</hi> in the Confession of our Faith. But if these implied sences do differ from the Romish <hi>reserued sence,</hi> then was it both wicked &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, to seeke to draw that exorbitant and inapprehensible do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Equiuocating,</hi> from such sentences of Scripture which are no more Equiuocall, then be the doctrines of our Faith.</p>
                        <p n="20">20 The second Case is in the examination concerning their
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:13232:230"/>
Priesthood, where the Priest being asked, <hi>Whether he be a Priest,</hi> is licensed to answer, according to their daily practize, saying; <hi>I am no Priest,</hi> with this Reseruation, <hi>as purposing to tell it you.</hi> Now then, knowing that they hold ordination of <hi>Priesthood</hi> to be a Sacrament, which impresseth in the soule an <hi>indelible Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, &amp; which herein</hi> (as they say) <hi>excelleth al other Sacraments, in that it aduanceth a Priest a degree aboue all other Christians;</hi> the end whereof they make a reall <hi>Offering vp of Christ as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the quicke and the dead;</hi> I <note n="y" place="margin">Full Satisfact. part. 3. pag. 92.</note> tooke vpon me to argue, in effect, thus: Seeing euery Christian will hold it to be an impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie to Equioucate in denying his Baptisme, therefore may hee iudge it likewise a wickednes for a Priest to Equiuocate in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying his <hi>Priest-dome.</hi> Vnto which I expected an Answer of <hi>M.
