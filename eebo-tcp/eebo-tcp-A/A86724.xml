         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome Reports of late confirmed by your Lordſhips Letters to the Speaker, the Lord <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> and Lord <hi>Lambert,</hi> in print, followed with a Declaration ſince in print, the ſight and ſence of which, makes our hearts tremble to think, that you, who as brethren with the reſt of the Army, have gone hand in hand to hazard your lives for our Liberties, ſhould now appear to fall out for the want of a right underſtanding each of other; did you but ſee how the enemy doth triumph with your Declaration, or Letters, in their hands; and what freſh blood ſeems to be gathered in their hearts from your threatning to loſe your blood againſt your brethren; and how that none but enemies to our dear bought Liberties triumph in this, ſure you would lay your hands upon your hearts, and judge that your proceed cannot be of God, and that God will not proſper you in a deſign of this nature, to throw away all that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and freedome at one caſt, which ſo many years vaſt treaſure and blood hath purchaſed by Inch-meal. We are alſo ſadly grieved to hear the reports of the Malignant ſpirits, ſome crying out, <hi>Monk</hi> was alwayes true to his old Maſter, and now he will ſeaſonably ſerve him; others crying out, The brethren of Iniquity have ſet each others houſe on fire, and we will ſtand by and warm our ſelves; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beleeve how theſe few dayes and nights, ſince your Letters were ſeen, what roaring and ranting hath been amongſt the enemies of our Liberties; what heart-breakings and tears they have cauſed in the hearts of them that fear God. As you have any pity to the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Nations, take a ſecond and more ſerious view, as of the grounds of your reſolutions, ſo, of the bloody effect that your deſign unavoidably will cauſe, if you perſiſt in it. You cannot be ignorant, that in all theſe ſtrange revolutions, God is carrying on a deſign, and how never none proſpered that ſtood againſt it, though under ſpecious pretences of a juſt ground, witneſs Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> and his party, crying up Parliament priviledges. Would you be one that ſides with God in his deſign? It is not a probable way to anſwer Gods end by impriſoning his inſtruments, and countenancing his enemies. If any change be admirable, that is, that thoſe good men that not long ſince were objects of your favor, are now under your frowns. It's a ſad beginning-work, to impriſon ſo many godly men, as we hear you have; for, though ſome thouſands of us differ from ſome of them in ſome ſmall matters in the form of worſhip, yet we judge they with us are children of one Father; and ſuch, that he hath, and we truſt will favour in this ſad day. Alas, what would you have your brethren do? would you have the fruit of their Repentance to have been a willing putting their necks under the yoak of ſlavery ſo long fought againſt, and have led us to have done the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> a willing ſubmiſſion to be deprived of the Liberty of petitioning Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and judged Traitors for ſo doing, when as it is the proper and true birth-right of all Engliſhmen? Do you judge that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of any evil ſhould cauſe them to ſtand by evil, and ſet open the flood-gates of ruine upon the Liberty of the people of theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which unavoidably muſt have been, if their practice before mentioned had not been ſtopt? It was a ſad violence to the people and Armies liberty, for the Parliament to Vote out ſo many noble Aſſertors of our Liberty in one day, and we are credibly informed ſo many more were deſigned to be ſo dealt withall within a few dayes. What would the end have been? Oh, unheard of practice! and for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of this, ſhall your brethren and friends be accounted your enemies? Will you call every check and ſtop to unjuſt proceeds, a force upon a Parliament, eſpecially when it ariſeth from ſome perſonal animoſity and ambition in ſome few men in Parliament? Or can your ſtanding by ſuch men in ſuch a practice, be a true aſſerting of Parliament-priviledge, or the fundamentall rights of the people? But part of our comfort is our hopes, when you underſtand it is not a part, but the whole Army that doth this; and that it was not a perſonal advantage, but a publique neceſſity, that did put a force upon the Army, to put a check to theſe men in Parliament, you will ſoon change your minds, and put an end to our enemies hopes, and turn our ſorrows into joy. Alas! ſhould men there have their Liberty to do what they will, how ſoon would the ſpirit of the people run into the Parliament, and the ſpirit of the Parliament into a King, and his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into Tyranny? Where is then our Liberty ſo long prayed and fought for? If you will but ſet all prejudice aſide, and conſider, That if you and the Army fall out about this buſineſs, thus ſtated, as our State ſtands, and as the ſpirits of people are now diſpoſed, the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned evils unavoidably will come upon us. All which we humbly beg, you would ſeriouſly and ſeaſonably conſider: And we fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intreat, that you would put a candid conſtruction upon our thus interpoſing, and tendring the poor mite of our advice. The Lord in whom is our ſtrength, knows we do it not out of any evil deſign; but as poor <hi>Abigails,</hi> whoſe ſayings hereafter may be found ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and ſuch, who dare not but empty to you our hearts, before we take up Arms in ſtanding by the Army, which we judge in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience we are bound to do, hazarding our Lives, and our <hi>All</hi> with them, whom God hath ſo highly honored. But we truſt the Lord, will ſo change your hearts, that we ſhall never have cauſe to lift up our hands againſt you, in ſtanding by them; but if we do, we have faithfully declared our grounds, and done our duty, and could no otherwiſe do, leſt you ſhould judge the hearts of all Gods people were with you.
