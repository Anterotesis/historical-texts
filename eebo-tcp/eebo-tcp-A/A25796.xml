            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lords and Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough I have had the Honor to be named by the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> in all the Commissions which had relation to this Kingdom since the beginning of this War; yet I had never the happinesse to be with Your Lordships till now, wherein I reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Gods Providence; that he hath brought me hither at such an opportunity, when I may boldly say, it is in the power of the two Kingdoms, yea, I may say in Your Lordships power, to make us both happy, if You make good use of this occasion, by setling Religion, the Peace and Union of these Kingdoms. The work of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in these Kingdoms is so great a work, as no Age nor History can parallel since Christs days; for no one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had ever such a Reformation set forth unto them, much lesse three Kingdoms: So that this Generation may truly think themselves happy if they can be Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in it. And as the work is very great, so it cannot be expected but it must have great and powerful Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, not only flesh and blood which hate to be Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but Principalities and Powers, the Rulers of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this world, and Spiritual wickednesses in high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. As the dangers are great, we must look the better to our duties; and the best way to perform these, is to keep us by the Rules which are to be found in our National Covenant, principally the Word of God; and in its own place, the Example of the best Reformed Churches. And in our way we must beware of some rocks, which are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations both upon the right &amp; left hand, so that we must hold the middle path. Upon the one part we would take
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53391:3"/>
heed not to setle lawlesse Liberty in Religion, whereby in stead of Uniformity, we should set up a thousand Heresies &amp; Schisms, which is directly contrary and destructive to our Covenant. Upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other part we are to look that we persecute not Piety &amp; Peaceable men, who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not through scruple of Conscience come up in all things to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Rule: But that they may have such a forbearance as may be according to the Word of God, may consist with the Covenant, and not be destructive to the Rule it self, nor to the Peace of the Church and Kingdom; wherein I will insist no further, either to wrong Your Lordships pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience or judgements, who, I doubt not, will be very careful to do every thing according to our Covenant.</p>
            <p>As to the other point, concerning the Peace and Union of the Kingdoms, I know it is that which all professe they desire; I hope it is that all do aim at: Sure I am, it is that which all men ought to study and endeavor. And I think it not amisse to remember Your Lordships of some former experiences as an Argument to move us to be wise for the future. If the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> in the 1640. year of God then sitting in Parliament, had concurred as they were desired against the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> No question we had been brought to many difficulties, which blessed be God, was by the Wisdom of the Honorable Houses prevented. So likewise when this Kingdom was in difficulties, if the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> had not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yea cheerfully sacrificed their Peace to concur with this Kingdom, Your Lordships all know what might have been the danger. Therefore let us hold fast that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which is so happily established betwixt us; And let nothing make us again two, who are so many ways one; All of one Language in one Island, all under one King, one in Religion, yea one in Covenant, so that in effect we differ in nothing, but in the name (&amp; so do Brethren) which I wish were also removed, that we might be altogether one, if the two Kingdoms shall think fit: For I dare say,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53391:3"/>
not the greatest Kingdom in the Earth can prejudice both, so much as one of them may do the other.</p>
            <p>I will forbear at this time to speak of the many Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies I hear are suggested, for as I do not love them, so I delight not to mention them: Only one I cannot forbear to speak of, as if the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> were too much affected with the Kings Interest. I will not deny but the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by reason of the Raign of many Kings His Progenitors over them, hath a natural affection to His Majesty, whereby they wish he may be rather Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed then Ruined: Yet experience may tell, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal regard to Him hath never made them forget that common Rule, <hi>The Safety of the People is the Supreme Law:</hi> So likewise their love to Monarchy makes them very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous that it may be rather regulated, then destroyed, which I hope I need not to mention further to Your Lordships, who I trust, are of the same minde.</p>
            <p>I know likewise there are many Jealousies and unjust Aspersions cast upon the Scotish Armies in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> I can (if it were needful) presently produce heads of a Declaration intended by the Army in <hi>England</hi> for vindicating themselves from such Injuries, and shewing the clearnesse of their Resolutions and Integrity, both in the Cause, and towards this Kingdom, wherein their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings and coming in at such a season of the year, their hard sufferings and constant endeavors since, may be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient testimonies. Therfore I am the more bold to desire Your Lordships, That so long as they stay in <hi>England</hi> (which I wish may be for a short time) they may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with some moneys, and their quarters enlarged, least their lying in too narrowquarters, make the burthen in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable to that exhausted corner of the Countrey where they now remain, and so beget out-cryes against them, when they are not-enabled to discharge their quarters, as other Armies within the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>As for the Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I have been an eye witness
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53391:4"/>
to their sufferings, and so may speak of it likewise upon certain knowledge, that never men have suffered greater hardships, who might have been provided; for they have lived many times upon a few Beans measured out to them by number, and never had any other drink but water; And when they were in some better condition, they had but an Irish Peck of rough Oats for a whole week; And now at their best conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when they are quartered upon the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try (which is able to entertain them only for a very short time) they have only an Irish Peck of Oat-meal, or a shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the ten days both for meat and drink. Therefore, according to the many desires given in to the Honorable Houses for that end, I humbly entreat that Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships will take care to provide for them, so long as it is thought fit they remain in that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>For a renewed testimony of our earnest desires to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Honorable Houses for setling the Peace of these Kingdoms, so much longed for, We do return unto Your Lordships the Propositions of Peace (which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived on <hi>Tuesday</hi> last) with our consent thereunto, wishing they may be hasted to His Majesty, who hath so often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for them. And I likewise offer to Your Lordships the copy of His Majesties Letter to my L: <hi>Ormond,</hi> dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him from any further medling in any Treaty with the Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I hope in order to His Majesties fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condescending to the setling of that Proposition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the rest of the Propositions now to be sent unto Him. Another Paper there is which concerns the supplying of the Scotish Armies in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the perfecting of the Accompts between the Kingdoms, together with a Letter from Gen: Major <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> to the Committee of Estates of the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> concerning the: state of affairs in <hi>Ireland.</hi> All which, when Your Lordships have considered, I trust ye will take such course therein, as may satisfie our just desires, may put an end to our present troubles, and settle these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in a happy Peace.</p>

            <head>The Paper wherein the Commissioners for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> consent to the Propositions of PEACE.</head>
            <p>IT is above a twelve moneth sithence we did earnestly presse the sending of Propositions to the King for a safe and well grounded Peace. In answer whereunto, the Honorable Houses were pleased to acquaint us, That they had resolved Propositions should be sent to His Majesty, but did intend to make some alterations, in the former Propositions, and after eight or nine Moneths deliberation we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Honorable Houses some of those Propositions: And though we did finde therein very material Additions, Alterations and Omissions, which for their great importance, and the interest of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> therein, might very well have required the delay of an Answer until the Estates of that Kingdom had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted; yet so unwilling were we to retard the means of Peace, that in a Fortnights time we returned an Answer upon the whole Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; And the Houses of Parliament not resting satisfied therewith, in less then ten dayes we prepared a further Answer, wherein we did very much comply with the Desires of the Honorable Houses, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the matter of the setling of the <hi>Militia of England &amp; Ireland,</hi> and in other things did shew our readinesse to hear or propose such Expedients as might determine our Differences: So that in a whole years time the Propositions have not remained in our hands the space of four weeks (which we only mention to clear our proceedings fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mistakes &amp; aspersions) And the Househaving now after two months further deliberation delivered unto us upon the 23. of this instant June, all the Propositions they intend to send to the King at this time; We do without any delay return such an Answer &amp; Resolution thereupon, as will be to the present and future Generations one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable Testimony (besides many others) of the Integrity &amp; Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> in their Solemn League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, of their love to Peace, and earnest desire to satisfie their Brethren of <hi>England,</hi> in those things which concern the good and Government of this Kingdom: Being further Resolved, touching the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> That as nothing of single or sole concernment to that Nation did engage them in this War, so nothing of that nature shall continue the same. Although these Propositions now to be sent, do much differ from the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions formerly agreed upon by the Parliaments of both Kingdoms,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53391:5"/>
and the most material Additions, Omissions and Alterations, are in such particulars as concern the joynt Interest &amp; mutual Confidence &amp; Conjunction of both Kingdoms, which were, as we conceive, much better provided for, and strengthned by the former Propositions then by these; although the particular Propositions presented by us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> are not yet agreed unto by the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Parliament, as was offered in their Paper of the 10. of April; although divers Propositions of joynt concernment be now superse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the sending of them delayed to a more convenient time, as is expressed in the Votes of both Houses the 26. of March; and although (which is to us more then all the rest) those Ordinances of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unto which the fifth and sixth Propositions do relate (and were therefore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated unto us upon our desire to see what the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses had already agreed upon concerning Religion) do not contain the establishment of such a Reformation of Religion, and Uniformity as was expected and was the chief end of our Engagement in this War. And as all these Ordinances put together come short of what we wished, so there are some particulars which we conceive to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the Word of God, and the Example of the best Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, and therefore cannot in our consciences consent unto them; which particulars were expressed to both Houses in the Remonstrance of the Commissioners of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of the date March 26. 1646. Yet neverthelesse, we do so earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and so highly value the easing of the heavie pressures under which both Kingdoms groan, and the bringing of this bloody lasting War to a speedy and happy end; considering withal, that not onely the Book of Common-Prayer, and the Prelatical Government are abolished, and a common Directory of Worship established in both Kingdoms, but that likewise the Ordinances aforementioned do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain divers parts of a positive Reformation &amp; Uniformity in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Government, unto which we formerly gave our consent in our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer upon the whole Propositions of Peace of the 20. of April, and for so happy beginnings, and so good a foundation laid for the future, we heartily thank God, and do acknowledge the Zeal, Piety, and Wisdom of the Honorable Houses therein, remembring also, that these Ordinances do not contain the whole Model of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and that the Houses have been pleased to expresse, [<hi>That it cannot be expected, that a perfect Rule in every particular should be setled all at once, but that there will be need of Supplements and Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and happily of Alterations in some things, as experience shall bring to light the necessity thereof.</hi>

            <p>HAving so often represented by Papers, and now by word to the Honourable Houses, the extreame necessities of our Armies in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> We shall not trouble them with unnecessary repetition, but onely mention those desires which require their very speedy consideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1 We desire, that for easing the Countrey of their great pressures, and preventing many dangerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, the quarters of the Scottish Army in the North of this Kingdome may be enlarged, and a consid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable supply of money dispatched unto them.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That money, Provisions, and ammunition may be sent to the Scottish army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the same care taken in providing for them as for other forces imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that kingdome.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That the 5000 Armes long since promised, and in an Ordinance of both Houses of the 26 of <hi>August</hi> 1645,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53391:6"/>
referred to the care of the Committee sitting at Hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdashers-hall, may be speedily provided; and that the honourable Houses will be pleased to grant power to that Committee, to contract and make payment as well as to treat for furnishing of these Armes, by reason of which defect in the Ordinance, the sending of these Armes hath been hitherto retarded.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That to prevent the further invasion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Scotland</hi> by the Irish Rebels, ships may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently sent to attend the coasts betwixt <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Commanders of these ships authorised with such instructions as are agreeable to the Treaties between the Kingdomes.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That the Honourable Houses will be pleased to send Commissioners to joyne with the Committee of Estates, residing with the Scottish Army, who may be witnesses as of their other proceedings, so of their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest desires and reall endeavours with the <hi>King,</hi> for giving speedy and full satisfaction to both Kingdoms. And it is also our earnest request, that these Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners may have power to Treat and agree with the Committee of Estates, concerning the stating of the accompts, and setling any differences that may arise thereupon. And further to Treat and agree upon O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures, estimated Mediums, or expedients for the speedy setling therereof (which we are confident may be done in a very few dayes) and either finally to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them, or represent them to both Houses; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by withall possible expedition upon the setling of the Propositions and accompts, such course may be taken as all Armes may be disbanded, the Kingdoms eased of their heavy pressures and insupportable burthens, that so all things being setled in a brotherly way, we and our

posterity may after so unhappy and troublesome a War, enjoy a quiet and blessed Peace.</p>

                  <p>IT being my duty to represent unto your honours the condition of affaires here touching our Army, and these of the Brittish Army, who were engaged with us in the service being extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily scarce of provisions, and hearing from all parts that the Irish had no considerable Army on foot, for preservation of our quarters it was resolved by joynt advice to make to the Feilds with a Moneths provision, for to purchase victualls or Cattell from the enemy; So that we entred our march the second of <hi>Iune</hi> being effective under Armes 3400 fooot, and eleven Troopes of horse with six feilding peeces, And Colonell <hi>Monro</hi> was to joyne with us at Glashloch with three Troopes of horse, and 240 Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queriers, Auchinbreck being left at home for defence of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; the Marquis Regiment being landed from Scotland two dayes before, could not be gotten in readinesse to joyne with us. It was also condiscended on by the English Commissioners and me, that the Laggan forces should march unto Connaght immedately to keepe the enemy busied there, who were ordained to keepe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency with us on all occasions; having parted with our Commissioners the second night of our march neere Drummore. The fourth in the morning, I commanded forth a party of horse being 72, commanded horse-men led by the Lieutenant of my Troope <hi>Daniel Monro,</hi> who had direction to crosse the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water at Benburg to scoure the fields, and to certifie Colonell <hi>Monro</hi> of my Rendezvouz place at Glasloch <hi>Iune</hi> the 5. whereby the way at Armagh the party unexpectedly foregathered with the enemies fore Troope, and tooke a prisoner of theirs, who gave intelligence that the enemies Army were marching that morning from Glasloch to quarter at Benburg andCharlemount, which intercepted my party from going to Colonell <hi>Monro,</hi> the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner being sent to meete mee, after examination certified us
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53391:8"/>
the enemies Army were effective above 5000 foote, and twelve Troopes of horse provided with a fortnights Victualls. Being thus informed I presently broke up our night leagure and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed six miles surther to Hamiltons hand foure miles from Armagh, and sent for our party to retire upon the Army, being impossible for them to get through to Colonell <hi>Monro.</hi> Friday the fifth by foure of the clock in the morning I marched to Armagh in view of the Enemy, thinking the nearer our Army was to theirs, to hinder them from sending any strength to fall upon Colonell <hi>Monro,</hi> his way lying directly towards the enemies quarters. And having viewed the enemies Army in a posture to defend the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage at Benburg, which being hard for us to force the passage, by reason of the straitnesse of the passe, the enemy being master of the Bridge and of the Ford, very advantagious for him; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently I conveened the Officers of the Army to consult what was best for us to undertake, whereby joynt advice it was resolved to march with the Army in the enemies view to Kinnard to crosse the Water there, And so to draw the enemy from his advantage, and from Colonell <hi>Monro</hi> his party being but weake, which being effectuated we were betwixt the enemy and his Victualls, having gained the passe at Kinnard without dispute and had he enemy betwixt us and our party, and our baggage secured in our Reare; All our Army foote and horse did earnestly cover fighting, which was impossible for mee to gainestand without being reproached of Cowardice; And therefore having provided our selves for Battell, And that orderly, with resolution, we advanced towards the enemy about six a Clock at night, and beate in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded men and fore Troopes to their Army, where they stood ready in Battell to receive us. Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Cuningham,</hi> with 500 commanded men cleered the passage for our horsemen to advance who were commanded then in absence of Colonell <hi>Moure</hi> by the Lord Viscount of Ardes; The Army followed up after the feilding Peeces, and drew up in Battell forth against the enemy, who had possessed themselves with the advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ground, where their foot were covered with scrogs and Bushes; the service begun hot on both sides continued from six a clock at night till after Sunne set. The enemy could not get charged on

our left or right Wing having the blackwater on the right hand and a marrish bog on the left wing, and wee being drawne up in the plaine, having our peices before us and our horsemen behind our reserve, and it being impossible for the enemy to charge us but in our van, our horsemen could receive them marching up, and charging through the intervals, betwixt the brigades of foot, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout sun set I perceived the enemy making ready for a generall assault, first with his foot and his horse coming up behind his foot to second them, I had given order to a squadron of our horse to break through them before they should advance to our foot, that squadron of horse consisting for the most part of Irish riders, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though under the English command, did not charge but retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted disorderly through our foot, making the enemies horse for to follow them at least one squadron, notwithstanding thereof our foot stood to it, and received the enemies batalions body to body with push of pike, till at last our second squadron of horse charged: the enemies horse and fell pell mell amongst our foot, who being carried in disorder, had no way of retreat but to wade the Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water where it was scarce foordable, and by that meanes and the darknesse of the night many of our foot escaped with the losse of some few Officers, six field pieces, and some colours, so that by all appearance the Irish under the Lesnegarvey horsemen had a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to betray the Army by their running away; leaving the foot to be cut downe, who were also deserted by the rest of the horse after retiring from their last charge, the enemy falling on our baggage, the baggage horses being all gone, the enemy loved the spoyle better then to prosecute the victory. So that we lost off the foote at the nearest conjecture five or six hundred, and twenty Officers were taken prisoners the Lord of Ardes being one, we lost also many armes by reason the souldiers had above 50 miles to retire. And notwithstanding of all our losses, the enemy as yet (praised be God) hath not attempted to prosecute his victory within our quarters, and Col. Monro with his party miraculous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retreated home from the enemy who viewed them, without the losse of a man. And now we are making up out forces again, having not lost of our horsemen above thirty, and one Cornet who was killed; we are both scarce of armes and victuals, and for ought

I can understand, the Lord of Hosts had a controversie with us to rub shame on our faces, as on other armies, till once we shall be humbled; for a greater confidence did I never see in any Army then was amongst us, and we behooved to taste of bitternesse as well as others of both nations; but praised be God being now humbled before God, we increase in courage and resolution so according to your interest in us and in the poore inhabitants in this Province, use some speedy meanes to supply us.
