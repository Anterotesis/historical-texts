            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALthough <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> from our Cradles to our Graves, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue us swiftly, and, according to the Almighties Ordinance, overtake and seize upon our frail and earthly parts, upon some sooner, upon others later: yet <hi>Excellent Acts,</hi> like strong <hi>Eagles,</hi> break from their seizure, and soar above them in so sublime a pitch, as neither <hi>Time,</hi> with all his Power and rusty Powder, with which he blots and rubs out <hi>Brass</hi> and <hi>Marble,</hi> can quite obscure or extinguish them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Death</hi> close in his dark-gaping Mouth (the <hi>Grave</hi>) their Nobleness. Witness this small, yet ancient <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> which this last <hi>Summer</hi> I made part of my Exercise, to put into an <hi>English</hi> Habit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66194:3"/>That the Story is ancient, I may well say; for it is 1900 years since <hi>Aristeus</hi> Writ it to his Brother <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>; which <hi>Aristeus,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Pentateuk</hi> of the <hi>Bible,</hi> says, was<note n="*" place="margin">Great Esquire.</note> 
               <hi>Hyperaspistes</hi> to <hi>Ptolomeus Philadelphus,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt, Syria, Phenicia,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and son of <hi>Ptolomeus Lagus,</hi> one of the great Captains of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Magnus,</hi> that divided his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests (the World) amongst them.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Ptolomeus Philadelphus</hi> was a most accomplish'd young Gentleman, vertuously disposed and so great a lover of <hi>Learning,</hi> as he had accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into his Library according to some Authors, 1800000 Volumes,<note place="margin">Argument of the History.</note> Printing being not then risen in our <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere,</hi> was by the said <hi>Aristeus,</hi> a most Noble Person, and a great friend of (the then captive <hi>Iews</hi>) (as an Instrument of God) for the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Freedom of them, (then his People) practised with <hi>Demetrius
<pb facs="tcp:66194:3"/>
Phalerius,</hi> to tell the King, that his so abundant Library was but poor, because it wanted the Book of Books, the sacred Volume of God, which we call the <hi>Holy Bible</hi>: The King, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously covetous thereof, demanded how he should best acquire it? <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steus,</hi> waiting this desired Occasion, proportioned his advice, that he should first set all the Captived <hi>Iews,</hi> not only in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but also in <hi>Syria, &amp;c.</hi> at free Liberty: and send Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors and Presents to <hi>Eleazar</hi> their High Priest and Pontiff. The King willingly consents thereto, as to the Musick of his desires, and prepares most rich Presents, as a Table of Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie Gold, embellish'd with precious Stones, Cups of Gold and Silver like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise adorned, sets at freedom the Captived by publick Edict, and sends as Ambassadours <hi>Aristeus,</hi> and <hi>Andrea,</hi> Prince and great Captain of the Guard of his Person, with these Gifts, and divers Talents of Gold and Silver.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66194:4"/>They go, deliver his Letters of Request and Commends, have graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous entertainment, return with the 72 Interpreters <hi>Iews</hi> Letters, and also <hi>Eleazars</hi> Presents to the King, and in especial, with the Sacred Volume and Word of God.</p>
            <p>The good King adores the Books, feasts the Bringers, who after fall to the Business, and Translated it out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> into the <hi>Greek,</hi> the common learned Language of those Times, made famous by the Sword of <hi>Alexander.</hi> And this in brief is the effect of this <hi>Venerable History,</hi> which is by me thus made yours.</p>
            <p>And though I seem to Anticipate thus to you, yet it is as nothing; for in it self, as you may further see, it is Elaborately and Eloquently Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the said <hi>Aristeus</hi>; and let no man wonder too much thereat, as thinking our Times excell theirs in Eloquence: No; For who ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Demostenes</hi> the <hi>Greek,</hi> or <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> the <hi>Latin,</hi> therein?</p>
            <p>

            <p>For, hath not <hi>Plutarch</hi> made those Gyant <hi>Heroes,</hi> as <hi>Theseus, Romulus, Alexander, Iulius Caesar,</hi> and the rest, yet live? and himself, more praisfully, longer then them all?

                  <hi>1.</hi> Of <hi>Ptolomeus Philadelphus.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>PTolomeus, second of that Name, Surnamed <hi>Philadelphus,</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> of <hi>Phaenicia,</hi> and of <hi>Cypres,</hi> Son of the first <hi>Ptolomeus,</hi> Son of <note n="*" place="margin">One of the Captains of Great <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> the third Monarch.</note> 
                  <hi>Lagus,</hi> began his Reign in the 271 year before the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Ptolomeus Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphus</hi> was endoctrined in the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of good Letters, by <hi>Strabo</hi> the <hi>Peripatetick:</hi> in which he became so excellent, that he was esteemed one of the most accomplish'd Princes of his Time: but that which was in him the most admirable, was, the Bounty, Debonarity, Sweetness, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Spirit, accommodated with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66194:8"/>
the Manners and Complexions of all worthy and deserving Persons.</p>
               <p>By this means he entred so far, and before, in the Grace of all the World, that every one in his thought wish'd he were King: And his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, knowing his right of Succession was to be so, and rejoycing in his hopes of him, made him to be crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King, and devested himself of all Authority, without reserving any Power, Right, or Preheminence to himself, only a Superintendency over the Guard of the King his Son, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying to be Father of such a King: For the admiration he had of his high Vertues, kindled and gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion between them both, of a most kind contention in mutual Offices, the Son yielding to the Father, and the Father to the Son, in all, and by all, through instinct of Devotion and Piety, so they gave lively touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es one to the other in all reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fitting Offices, which was cause that the People conceived a great
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66194:8"/>
Fidelity and Amity towards them, so as it seemed, even the Divine Providence prepared this Noble Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to introduce that great good amongst Humanes, as to make them participants of the Laws, and Divine Illuminations wherewith God had favoured the People of the <hi>Iews</hi> above all the Nations of the World. And it seemeth, that even then his Almightiness made a preparative for the Vocation of the Ethnicks and Gentiles by Communication so of his holy Law; whereof <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was the ordained Minister, to call the Seventy Interpreters into <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">As the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins now in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> to translate into the Greek Language, which then was the most used and vulgar through the whole Universe. So as I am amazed at some fanatical Spirits, that hinder us from the Knowledge of God, in not giving his Word in the Language of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wheresoever, as is appertaining to every one in Regard of Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:66194:9"/>I would ask those men, what Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage spake those Dames of <hi>Rome, Paula, Eustochina, Melania, Susanna, Fabiola, Demetria, Furia, Flavia, Blesilla,</hi> and others? For the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whom, Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many Books of Holy Scriptures out of strange Tongues into <hi>Latin,</hi> which was the natural Language of the said Ladies. I would also know, who was more Wise, or better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired then St. <hi>Hierom</hi>? Further, it seems they either are, or would seem to be ignorant of the Institution of the Emperour <hi>Iustinian,</hi> who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that those who sung in the Temples, that they should sing high, and so intelligible, that all the People might understand them.</p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>Ptolomy</hi>; He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to erect a Library in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital City of his Realm, <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the Charge whereof he gave to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius Phalerius,</hi> a Prince, and an <hi>Athenian</hi> Philosopher, who erected it so sumptuously, that there was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66194:9"/>
not the like in all the World: and it lasted until the first War of the <hi>Romans</hi> against the <hi>Alexandrians</hi>? This King had to Wife <hi>Arsinoe,</hi> to whom he caused a Statue to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, in height four Cubits, of one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Stone, call'd a <hi>Topaz,</hi> the which had been given to <hi>Bernice</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> by a Prince named <hi>Philemon.</hi>

of the <hi>Iews,</hi> that then were held Slaves throughout all the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Ptolomy</hi>; for he made the first request for them, and obtained it. And for this cause he was sent Ambassadour with <hi>Andrea,</hi> Prince of the Guards belonging to the King, unto <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> to deal with the High-Priest <hi>Eleazar</hi>; who sent to the King <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> six Doctors of every Tribe to go on with the Translation and Version of the Holy Books of <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He writ diligently his Voyage, where he shews openly, how and by what course those seventy two Interpreters behaved themselves in the said Books. <note n="1" place="margin">

but the five Books, that is <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> which they call the <hi>Pentateuck,</hi> which is the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>: for <hi>Aristeus</hi> speaks but of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and it is not likely that they touched the Books Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, nor the Prophets; for if it had been so, <hi>Aristeus</hi> would not have been silent thereof.</p>
               <p>Moreover, that which they Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated, was finished in the space of seventy two dayes, which is about two Months and a half, and that's a Time too small, and therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to Translate all the Old Testament. Nevertheless, I am not ignorant, that there was a turning of other Books of the Bible, that go by the name of the seventy two Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters. But I am perswaded that they were not then done in <hi>Egypt,</hi> unless that after they were returned to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> they Translated the rest of the Holy Books: although both in that and other Opinions, I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66194:11"/>
submit me to the deliberation of the Church, from which I will not stray. But however, this Translation was manifestly Miraculous: which is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently shewed, by that our Lord Jesus Christ and his Apostles, in Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of the Law, use the Versi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these seventy two Interpreters. I have spoken these few Words of <hi>Aristeus,</hi> to the end the Reader shall not think that this is that <hi>Aristeus Proconensis,</hi> that could be invisible when he listed, making folks believe that he could dye and rise again when he would, of whom speaks <hi>Suidas, Herodotus, Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the Life of <hi>Romulus.</hi>

               <p>For the rest, to the end it may not seem that we make shew of ostentation in being prolix in this Preface, we will return to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, from whence we have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius Phalerius,</hi> Master of the Kings Library, after the best care he could, giving order to purchase Books from all Parts of the World: And employing for that purpose, great numbers of Persons, as Factors, dispersed in many places, who had in charge to buy and transcribe them; they so doing, and that with Diligence, the design of the King was accomplished and executed, at least in the best manner that was possible.</p>
               <p>For the King asking him, in our Presence, how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66194:15"/>
Volumes he had collected for his Library; he answered, for the present he had no more than two hundred thousand, and he hoped e're long to have to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 500000. But Sir (said he) I have understood that the Laws of the <hi>Iews</hi> deserve to be Copied and Translated, and to have place in your Library: And what hinders it, answered the King, that they be not? have you not all things to serve you convenient for that purpose? <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> Answered, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that those Laws should be Translated and Interpreted: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Iews</hi> had in use a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter peculiar to their Language, far different from the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> adjusting and accommodating their Letters to the Tone of the Voice, and that they were much decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, who held they spake the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Tongue: for their manner of Speech was far distant. To which the King replied, that he would
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66194:16"/>
write to the High Priest of the <hi>Iews,</hi> to the end that all might be obtained which was requisite, to bring this matter to an issue, as <hi>Demetrius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p>Then it came to my mind, that a fair opportunity presented for the freedom of all the <hi>Iews</hi> which his Father <hi>Ptolomaeus Lagus</hi> had led Captive from <hi>Iudea</hi> into <hi>Egypt.</hi> For whose enlargement he had often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated <hi>Sosibius</hi> the <hi>Tarentine,</hi> and <hi>Andrea</hi> Captain of the Guard to the Kings Body. For these two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding in the Army, had reduced to obedience all that were in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Phenicia,</hi> filling all those Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with fear and terrour: and then were the <hi>Iews</hi> some of them led Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, others disposed in manner of Colonies, in such numbers, as there were brought into <hi>Aegypt</hi> to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 100000 men, of whom were chosen well near 30000 effective, who were established as the Guard of the Province.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:66194:16"/>True it is, before that time, many had been sent with the <hi>Persians</hi> and other Companies that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded against the K. of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> under the leading of <hi>Psammiticke:</hi> but those that were there, were not of so great number as those which were led away only by <hi>Ptolomeus Lagus.</hi> For (as we have said) he train'd to Arms all those whom Age or Ability shew'd to be proper, and all the rest of the People, as well Children, as Old men and Women, he made use of for Colonies, determining with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that if at any time his men of War grew insolent, because none could surpass them in course or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of War, he had means to check their presumption, by such as might be drawn from these Colonies.</p>
               <p>Now then seeking an occasion to bring about the Liberty of these poor men (as I have formerly said) and having found my opportunity, I opened my desire to the King, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing after this manner.</p>

               <head>The Proposition of <hi>Aristeus</hi> to King <hi>Ptolomeus Philadelphus,</hi> for the delivery of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is nothing strange, my Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Lord and Soveraign, if many times it happen, that those very Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs which we manage, thwart and run counter to our Proceedings: for all the Nations of the <hi>Iews</hi> have one and the same Law, which we desire to be ours, not only Copied, but also Translated into the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue. How then expect you to succeed in this Affair, when the greatest part of them are here in your Kingdom kept Prisoners? unless it may please Your August and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Spirit to request their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Books, after you have restored to free Liberty those who live here in great calamity and pressure, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before all things Regard to that God who makes your Kingdom flourish, and hath crowned You with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66194:17"/>
great prosperity: which is the same God that hath given them that Sacred Law which we desire to have. For they worship that God who hath Made and Created all things, and is the very same, whose wonderful Works all Mankind see and admire, though some not so clearly as others; for (Sir) We and others Call him <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and not without reason, for it hath so seemed good to our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, because by him are Procre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and live all Creatures: the same also they esteem the Directer and and Governour of the Universe. And although he holds all Mortals in Subjection, nevertheless he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther frustrates nor disappoints the Prayers and Vows of those, who il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated with Spiritual Light, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his aid.</p>
               <p>We then ought humbly to desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e that he would incline our hearts to such good resolutions, as to do good, and that freely to every one, and especially to deliver and free those
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66194:18"/>
that indure Slavery and Bondage: for that since Mankind is the Work and Creation of God, who hath power to turn the heart and bend it which way it pleaseth him. We ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times after different Methods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it would please him to lead us to a Perfection of Goodness, as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Ruler of all Hearts and Spirits.</p>
               <p>By this acknowledgment, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive great hopes to consummate this Affair, principally, because I know God to be favourable to those that pray for things Reasonable and Equitable. For when men set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wholly to seek and accomplish what hath a tendency to Justice and Perfection of Goodness, God the Lord of all things conducts and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresseth their Actions and Affections to blessed &amp; happy Effects and Ends.</p>
               <p>The King, then as something gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a contented Countenance said to <hi>Andrea,</hi> How many are there of the <hi>Iews</hi> detained Captive? He answered in few words, more
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66194:18"/>
than 100000; It is a small Request then said the King, <hi>Aristeus</hi> requires of us, <hi>Sosibius</hi> and some others then there present answered, It is a thing (Sir) worthy Your Grandeur and Generosity, to make an agreeable Present to God by their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in testification of your Thanks and Acknowledgement, and since the Governour of Heaven and Earth hath raised you to a greater Height than all your Predecessors, it is but just that you make thus a greater &amp; more solemn Expression of your Thanks.</p>
               <p>The King then disposed to Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting and pastimes in a full Feast, and Assembly of his Nobles, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that the <hi>Iews</hi> should be all search'd out, and that every man of them should be redeemed for the summ of 20 Drachms by pole,<note place="margin">A Drachma is 3 shillings<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

should be expressed that was possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

effect well and worthily such an Interpretation and Translation: it is needful there should be Pains, curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Study and Reflection, which may be found in the endeavours of Many who are more sharp, more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and more discerning than One alone.</p>
               <p>Moreover, we judge that by the accomplishing so great a work, there will redound to us great Honour and Glory.</p>
               <p>For this cause therefore we have sent unto you, <hi>Andrea,</hi> Captain of the Guard, and <hi>Aristeus,</hi> men of Honourable place in our Court, who have Commission on our part to present you with Jewels for your sacrifices, and an Hundred Talents of Silver for other uses.</p>
               <p>Herein you will give us great content and pleasure, and express a courtesie resenting Amity, if you have need of any thing, to require it for we will not fail to furnish and accommodate you therewith imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</p>

               <p>We have received your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which brought us great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, by reason of your Counsel, Enterprise, and Design; as also for the love and good will you bear us.</p>
               <p>Having received them, we made a great Assembly of the People, to whom in a long Discourse, we have made known your Liberality to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Nation, and exposed to

                  <head>And first of the Table of Gold.</head>
                  <p>IT behoveth then, that first we describe the Table, for it was a work of admirable lustre. The King desiring to shew therein a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-piece of Work: wherefore he demanded the measure and dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Table which was in the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the same. When he knew the measure, he asked if they would receive a greater. And being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered by some of the Priests and others; if there where no let, a greater might have place there.</p>
                  <p>The King then replyed, that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> intended to give one five times big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than that was there, provided that might not be inconvenient for the Priests, by its disproportionable
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66194:30"/>
quantity. Further, consideration ought not only to be had of the Receit and Capacity of the Place, but also of its Accommodation to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices thereon to be prepared, and that he was not without considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the <hi>Iews</hi> had not made that which they then had in their Temple of so small size for penury and want of Gold: for when it was made, they abounded in all Wealth and Riches: but that it seemed to him they had so proportioned it from some reason of a perfect Dimension.</p>
                  <p>Therefore his Opinion was, that the Present would not be well and duly formed, if the Table he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make, were Longer or Higher than the Other. Therefore foreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in his Thoughts, which were clear and ready to weigh every thing with good judgement: he gave it in charge to the Goldsmiths that were most ingenious, and of best ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, to finish and accomplish the Business, engraven and adorned with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66194:30"/>
all possible Variety: commanding that those who wrought in the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Raisings, Floweries, Wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, Entortilations, and such like; should amuse themselves only for Beautifying and Decoration: and what was to be plain, should answer to the Measure and Dimension, and that in all these things they should be exquisitely Careful.</p>
                  <p>This Table was two Cubits large, and a Cubit and a half in height, nor are you to think it was covered with Plates of Gold superficially, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or it was made all of solid, massie, pure, and fine Gold; round about it was a Crown of twelve fingers large, wrapped with Barrs of Gold and other pretty Works in fair passages, in manner of little threds, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlaced with little cords retiring to the Canetils, a work very shining, and polished of the three sides, for the Table was made in a Triangular form, and on every side wrought of the same fashion: so that on what
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66194:31"/>
side soever one stood it appeared to be but one Frontispiece and one Face. For if you came to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it on one side, the plain of the Table by the Crown with which it was bordered, discovered to your eyes a most resplendant Beauty very admirable, and the outward work with the Rays and Splendour of the two Squares so dazled the eyes, that one could scarce behold it; for the Table as we have said, was Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular, and shewed with one and the same Front and Superficies on which side soever you turned.</p>
                  <p>It was also inchased with precious Stones fastned by Golden Buttons ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Loops, and these Stones were wrought so naturally within one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, that they shewed a String and Wreathing of such Subtilty, that to any ones thinking it was not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be imitated. And those Stones were supported and stayed by Buckles and Clasps of Gold for more firmness, and the Joints and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66194:31"/>
Connextures of Squares made with so great Art, knit and interwoven one within another, to keep sure and joyn all the work, that in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them the Art was scarce discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, in the great Compass of the Crown that environed the Table by the aspect above, there was a row of Stones in fashion of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Ovals that were riveted, and lockt together, and filed with little wreaths of Gold which raised the lustre: and these Oval Stones were thick set the one with the other; and the whole Table was as it were encircled with this thread of Ovals. A little above this Chain of wreathed Stones the Master Goldsmiths had laboured a Girdle of Flowers, and Clusters of all Fruits, interlaced and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together so well, that by their eminent risings amongst the Bosses of the encircling Crown, you might see Grapes clustered together; Ears of Corn, Dates, Apples, Olives,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66194:32"/>
Roses, and many such like; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which many Precious stones set and wrought in Gold in their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Form, in their true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Resemblance; representing those Fruits with admirable Art. And with this Adornment the Cornishes and Frontispiece of the Table were enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all round; and so was this Work of Fruits corresponding with the Oval Stones abovesaid.</p>
                  <p>To all these Decorations are joined other burnished Works, cut in Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and in part with wreaths and Verges of Gold, beautifying all the Circuit of the Table: So that from the two parts which presented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the sight, with the Beauty of the Crown to the place where stood the feet of the Table, one might see a like Beauty, and curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of folding; still full of lustre which part soever of the Table were turned.</p>
                  <p>They made the Plate of all the Table solid and massie, of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66194:32"/>
thickness of four fingers: to the end that they might more firmly and fixtly bind in the feet and tressles to support it strongly.</p>
                  <p>These feet were fastned to the Crown without being perceived how, and were firmly joined with Buckles and Clasps: in such manner that the Table might be supported and well fixt which way soever the Table were turned, and yet still shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the eye. In the Superficies hereof was represented in a fair work the Floud of <hi>Meander,</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with its circuits, returns, and windings; in the Channel of which, one might see a Splendour of precious Stones, representing its rowling waves, which Wreath was of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles, Emeralds, Agats, and all other sorts of Precious Stones, spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with their native Lustre.</p>
                  <p>Near to this Floud there was an interlaced Work as a Wreath of Hair, (a thing admirable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold) sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>wing in its aspect a Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrick
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66194:33"/>
Figure, made of <hi>Cristal</hi> and <hi>Amber,</hi> and this Figure was a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Square, whereof all the Squares were equal, and the Angles of the four sides oblique. In this polished Figure was shewed the forms of the Beholders, as in a fair Mirrour. For the rest, the Ingenious hand of the Master workmen had made the feet of the Table like <hi>Flower-de-luces,</hi> of which the Flowers tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning shell-like backwards, sustained the Table; the said <hi>Flower-de-luces</hi> thick with leaves, sprouting up as from within: the foot was sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and stayed in this manner.</p>
                  <p>There was a Stone of a Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, of which the length was twelve fingers; having the form of a Rock made in a Precipice, and had about eight fingers in breadth: and upon this stone was born up all the burthen and weight of the Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sle. Upon this rises up a Lyre or Herbstring, which twining about the enclosure of a Vine, embraced it
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66194:33"/>
even to the top, the Grapes hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about on every side: In this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble were four feet alike in dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and proportion of workmanship, and of all four was one self-same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective: and so well were these things accomplished and perfected, with admirable Skill and Contrivance, of men Inventive and Ingenious; that not only the aspect of things true was made as it were false and delusory to the eyes, but also one might hear the leaves rattle by stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a little wind moving them one against another: so were all things laboured even as it were to the Life and Nature, every thing shaping a lively Image of what it was designed to represent.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the Tressles of the Table were contrived moveable, and to be removed on all sides; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was a Secret of Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which could not be seen or perceived for the Greatness of the Work: and by the means of certain
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66194:34"/>
Clasps, all was to be removed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther although no one could perceive either Crevis, Joint, or Rivet: For the Table was no more than a Cubit and a half big in all, yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, was great Expence bestowed, and many Talents employed.</p>
                  <p>For after the King had resolved not to exceed the Measure and Size of that which was in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> all that he determined to lay out upon one much greater, was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and much more, in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coration of this: Thus all was done with great Skill and Design, and was very admirable and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, according to the Kings wish.</p>

                  <head>Of the Vessels, Cups, and Viols of Gold.</head>
                  <p>THe two Cups from the foot to the middle, were cut all in a scaly work; and betwixt every two Scales, riveted with Precious Stones, the radiant shine whereof, cast such a reflection to the Eyes, that it wounded the sight with a Glory. The Tower of these Cups was girt with a Sculpture of the Flood of <hi>Meander,</hi> of the height of a Cubit; all incompassed and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced with variety of Stones, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable beauty and value. Near the Flood, there was a tress of hairs of Gold, with tufts joined together from the Bowl above to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, being spread in clear ways like a net of Thred: In the middle parts whereof were to be seen many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, disposed in the form and figure of a Scutchion, amongst which there was only a Space or Interval of four fingers; whose Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66194:35"/>
made the Grace of the Work more agreeable to the Eye: upon the lips and border of the Cups there was a Crown interlaced with Flower-de-Luces, bunches of Grapes, intermixt one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and wreathed like Cordage, and so running round: These Cups thus wrought with most rich Workmanship, held more than two Mettrets.</p>
                  <p>But the Tankards of Silver were yet adorned and decorated with much more Beauty, in full work and polish: for within they were so resplendant, that one might see all things more to the life than in a Mirrour. And it is not possible to tell how the figures of all things were represented to the life, by the Polish and sparkling brightness of them, which were so radiant and shining, that if you set one of the Silver Cups by one of the Gold, then one of the Silver, and so one of Gold; and so followed this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66194:35"/>
they made an admirable shew, and impossible to be long lookt on; for they cast such a lightning from one side to another, with rays pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating one anothers lustre, that it even dazled and reverberated the point of the Sight, so that no soul was long able to behold them: For if you turned your Eyes to a Cup of Gold, they were so encountred with the order and splendour of the works variety, and with the force of the light and flaming, which would so strike the point of the sight, that you could hardly hold them from twinkling, so as you would be forced to turn them elsewhere, or not too steadily to behold their lightning: And if you lookt upon one of Silver, a greater effusion of Light was shed abroad: So that your eyes seized with dimness, you were not able to discern throughly the the structure and art.</p>
                  <p>For the Vessels and Viols of Gold, they were wrought with such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,

that the middles were adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with clusters of Grapes, the Verges and Lips with bunches and encirclings of leaves of Myrrh and Olives, wreath'd together in fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Crown, about all the mouth parts, and all set with Precious Stones, agreeing with the spaces and convenience of the distances: So as, I assure you, the Master-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, had expressed their Art in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellishing and adorning every thing, with an ambitious desire to grace the Design, and to exalt the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of the King: So that in all the Treasures, nor in all the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, nor what other thing soever, was not to be found any thing so rich, so fair, or so precious, as were these Royal Works.</p>
                  <p>For the King, who had a tender regard of his Honour, there had employed all care and diligence, and prodigally lavished his magnificence. For of his own accord he came of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to visit the Works, conversing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66194:36"/>
and mingling his advice with the Master-Goldsmiths, making them change, now this, now that, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Liking.</p>
                  <p>Likewise he forbad them expresly, to stir from their business, till all were finished and compleated according to his mind, so that all was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great Art in a most extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner, as well for a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his illustrious Excellence and Degree, as also for the Dignity of the High Priest, who was of so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a Character, for whom these things were intended.</p>
                  <p>Of great Value was the multitude of Stones, of which some were so Rare, as that they are scarce known, yet being of marvellous Greatness, they amounted to the Number of five thousand: And yet for all that, the Art was of greater value than the Stones: And all being valued together, it plainly appeared that both Precious Stones and curious Workmanship exceeded five times
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66194:37"/>
the Gold therein employed, both in Beauty and Value. In fine, I hope what I have already Written, may yield you some delight in knowing these rare and curious things, and the true love and ingenious goodness of the King therein.</p>
                  <p>Now that which follows, will set forth the Discourse of our Journey to <hi>Eleazar:</hi> And because you may at large understand all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, I will describe to you first the Province, or City of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and then the Country round it.</p>

               <p>WHen we arrived near to <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> we discovered the Town, scituate on the Mountain, in the midst of the Province of <hi>Iudea,</hi> opening thereby a farr extended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the View.

               <p>About the same is a Girdle of three tire of Walls raised to the height of seventy Cubits, and of convenient thickness in Proportion to the height, which encompass all the Temple with an excellent Beauty and magnificent Work: The sight of the Gates, the knitting and evenness of the Stones, the Frontispieces and Buttresses, the faces of the Portals represent a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with great lustre and excellency of Workman ship, and one might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66194:38"/>
there was a rich abundance of all things, and that no expence had been wanting.</p>
               <p>Without the the Temple, there was a Veil by which the Temple was closed; round this Veil was hanged Travers from the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the Portals, yielding a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleasing Spectacle; and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally then, when a little Wind rose from the Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Floor is paved with Stones, the Receptacles of the Waters which issue in great Quantity for the use of washing the Victimes after they have slain them, are hid in convenient Places; for in their Festival Daies, many thousands of Victims are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, by means whereof is furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out so great a Quantity of Water, that one would judge there issued commonly a considerable Spring. But this is a thing yet more admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and almost incredible: the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Conveyances of these Waters which are under Ground in the Temple, and stretch five Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs in Circuit. And to conduct these Waters into their Receptacles,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66194:39"/>
there are Pipes of Lead closed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Walls, drawing in all parts under the pavement of the Temple, by which the Waters void themselves after the Beasts are washt: likewise many Spouts and openings near to the foot of the Altar, which are unkown to all, but only those who serve the Sacrifices: and by these too the Blood of the Offerings in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is cleansed and carried off.</p>
               <p>We guessed the great quantity of Waters there shed by this means. The <hi>Iews</hi> having led us to walk out of the Town more than a League long, they shewed us a place, where we might hear the report of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that ran under the Earth, which seemed to me to be such, as when one voids water by whole Tuns.</p>

               <p>This <hi>Iordan</hi> swells and increaseth in the Summer, and overflows the Neighbouring Fields like the <hi>Nyle</hi>; covering a great part of the ground, and then falls into another River by <hi>Acra,</hi> both which empty at once into the Sea. There are many other Streams that bend their course towards <hi>Gaza</hi> and <hi>Azota</hi>; that have their turnings and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings through all the whole Province.</p>

In other parts, it is inclosed with Rivers, and Currents, so as the Valleys and the Plains are fortified with great Ditches and Trenches. On the other side, the Ways are so narrow and troublesome with Turnings and Windings, to and fro, that with great difficulty those that Travel by Land, come to the great City. They say also they were wont in former times to draw up Metals from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the bordering <hi>Arabia:</hi> But since the time that the <hi>Persians</hi> had Rule, this search of Metals was left off, the Expence being more than the Advantage, and the labour fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less; yet they say this excuse was
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:66194:46"/>
invented by the Inhabitants of those places, to the end that their Lands should not be swallowed up in the hollowness of the Mines, so that the Earth being open, no Passage could be afforded to Strangers in those nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Ways.</p>
               <p>And so much for these things, Brother <hi>Philocrates,</hi> I have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto thee. Now I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what concerns the Law, and its Interpretation and first Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation.</p>

               <p>THose that were chosen were very Honest and Vertuous men, excelling in all Knowledge, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scenced of Noble Race, and not only well vers'd in their own <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daick</hi> Learning, but also well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted and exercised in the <hi>Greek</hi> Letters; for they were reserved men, and always ready to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66194:46"/>
as Embassadours upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: For which they were, as it were, purposely bred, and as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and Able to Judge of those Things and Courses as the case re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: And were those that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the Publick Rules, and resolved with great sufficience all difficulties in their own Law: and had marvellous readiness, both for Haranguing and giving Sentence: They were men clearly void of all barbarous Incivility, of good and sweet Condition, and born as it were to follow their proper manner of Living and Estate in a Mediocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and most commendable Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty: still striving above all things to exceed all others in Wisdome and good Knowledges, and in these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours consisted all their Study, esteeming no search more than how to excel one the other in acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible graciousness, and sweetness of hearing and answering: so that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them were esteemed of in

their <hi>Tribe,</hi> as men worthy to have Preheminence and Principality for the Vertue that was in them.</p>
               <p>And it is worth the noting in what Honour they held <hi>Eleazar,</hi> and in what Respect he held them: For besides that he writ to the King to take care for their conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent return, he recommended with a passionate desire, and tender affection these reverent Persons to <hi>Andrea</hi>; desiring with many Intreaties and Requests that we should with our Credits and Grace with the King, open them a fair Access.</p>
               <p>To which we made Answer, that as these things were matters of our special Charge, so we should be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Discharge our selves answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with all due Care, wherefore we desired he would be at ease in that point, for they should therein be absolutely free. I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you (said he) I am upon this occasion in no little pain, and not without just cause; for I know the

King, a Prince so diligent, a Lover of vertuous and worthy Persons, and how industriously he seeks them; that there is no place free from his desires, when he hears where such are, that excel, or are remarkable for Wit or Learning. And I have been informed, that he useth to say what is most true, that in such manner of men dwells and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists the strength and defence of his Kingdom: and especially when he hath near about his person good store of Wise and Just men who have provident Counsel to give him, lest all should miscarry. Which I perceive well by those he hath pleased to send hither.</p>
               <p>And we earnestly profess that we send not these persons to be assisting to him in the Affairs of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but for the Publick Profit and an Universal Good of all his people, in which regard nothing ought to be refused, nothing that we will not indure.

Which our Law-maker considering, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all his Laws into Piety and Justice, he hath not only taught us all we ought to do by Words; but express<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

us to do Evil, hath set before our Eyes the Causes why God hath created every thing.</p>
               <p>First, he hath taught that God is One and All, by the Power of whom all things are Governed and Subsist; and that He is present in all Places; and without Whom, nothing can remain in its Being, be it never so Little; and that Nothing can be hidden from Him, whatsoever men do upon Earth never so Secretly even what men Do and Think with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themselves, or what they Plod and Contract one with another, all is to Him notorious and Naked before his Eyes. For He sees the things To Come, as if they were Present: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he out of his gracious Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness teacheth us that when any one sets himself to work Evil, he may assure himself it cannot be Hidden, and proposes thus by all the Law, no other thing than to shew the Power and Strength of our good God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:66194:50"/>Being then heedful of the begining of these things, he sheweth, that other People who have Opinion that there are many Gods, are themselves more powerful than the Gods they by Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adore. For they affirm foolishly, that the Images and Resemblances they frame of Stone, or of Wood, are the Representations and Shapes of those who have brought to light by their Inventions some Advantages to the Civil Affairs of Life; and these they Worship, prostrating themselves on their Knees before them. But they are out of their right Wits, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed out of themselves; and if one demand of them what are their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions? they alledge something produced from Nature, as if it were indeed a thing produced, created, and composed by the fore-said Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, although they never contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereto, in which they sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifest their Perverseness and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity. For it is well known, that if there be question of any good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:66194:51"/>
that there may be found at this day Persons more learned, more subtil, and more quick to invent any Art, then they have done, who have been in times past: yet they are not therefore adored as Gods, although the Sage <hi>Greeks</hi> esteemed such Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors worthy of Honour. What should I speak of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and their Neighbours, who are herein madder than the others, for these have some of them brought in Divine Worship to brute Beasts, others unto Reptiles: out of common Reason, and all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, making Sacrifices to the Living and Dead, immolating to them Victims? Wherefore the Wise and Understanding Law-maker, being instituted of God in the Knowledge of all things, hath hedged us in, and fortified us round as it were with a Trench and Palisado, and distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with a Wall of Iron, to the end, that being innocent in Soul, and pure in Body, we might not mingle our selves in any sort with other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66194:51"/>
and that rejecting all fond and vain Opinions, we might adore one only GOD, who hath power above all Creatures.</p>
               <p>For this, the Priests of the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> Princes of the People (although they fail in other things) name us Men of GOD, and agree with us in many things: because other People have not this Religion to Adore one only God, according to the Truth as we do: For others give themselves over to Gormandisings and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, building upon Shadows, amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselves with no other things but Pleasures and Belly-chear. Of which there is no one of us hath so much as thought, but all the course of our Lives is imployed only to the Knowledge of Vertue and Divine Power, to the end we fall not into Sin, nor be polluted by the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of such People in any manner whatever.</p>
               <p>He hath also defended and armed us on all sides with Purity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66194:52"/>
not only in our Meat and Drink, but also in what we handle, touch, see, and hear; for he hath reduced and brought all things before our natural Reason, for as all things have their Being from one Power, so with a most profound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath he appointed which we are to use, and from which we are to abstain. I will alledge you one or two for Example, to the end, that if you take heed to the Words and plain Speech, you cannot think that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> hath taken such Pains to ordain his Laws, because of <hi>Rats, Weasels,</hi> and such like things.</p>
               <p>For it is necessary you understand, that he hath very well and wisely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all things to the Honesty of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, having regard to Purity and Cleanliness, and to the correction and amendment of Manners. And as for Birds, and flying Fowls, he hath permitted us to eat ordinarily of such as are tame, and are different from others in Neatness and Cleanliness, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:66194:52"/>
that live upon Grain and Seeds, such as are Pidgeons, Turtles, Peacocks, Partridge, Geese, and the like. And such as he hath forbidden us to eat, they are wild, ravenous; living upon Flesh and Carrion, of proud Natures, inclined to Rapine and Prey, and such as by force set upon others, and seek not their living, but to the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, hurt, and injury of the other Poultry who are gentle and tame; but those fierce ones not only seize upon those of their own Kind, but also upon Lambs, Kidds, and even upon Men yet living, or half dead.</p>
               <p>Our Law-maker therefore, noting this by way of Similitude, and by a borrowed way of Translation, taken from the Nature of such Fowls, hath pronounc'd them unclean and infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as being willing to reduce and bring all things to the consideration of Purity and Cleanliness of the Soul; to the end that every one being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished by ordinary and domestick Examples, may understand how it

               <p>Wherefore he hath appointed that we engrave upon the Doors and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of our Houses such Inscriptions as should excite us to Thanksgiving, still to refresh our Memories with the Thoughts of God, and his Goodness to us, by a most evident sign, that all our Endeavours ought always to be, to mind us of Sincerity and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that each Thought ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to represent GOD before our Eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:66194:55"/>Also he hath appointed, that not only when we Sit at Table,<note place="margin">Order of Meats.</note> but when we Rise, we should praise the Works of God, not only in Word, but also with a grave and composed Countenance: reducing to Mind the perpetual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heavens, and that this alternative and successive Nature is Divine, and incomprehensible to Man. Thus to you is expounded the Reason of the forking of the Cloven-foot, its Import, as also of the Chewing of the Cud, which you inquir'd after: as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring you, that there is nothing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained which is superfluous or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the forming of the Mind, but by this Figurative Manner and Use, he hath accommodated all things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Truth.</p>
               <p>Also the said Law-giver, by a like Figure, hath admonished us from fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Injustice and Sin, by the hearing or too much relying upon our Eloquence, Prattle and Jesting, which we may learn in the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:66194:56"/>
of vile Beasts: for the <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi> are of a filthy Complexion: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>Rats,</hi> and such like Creatures, which he hath forbidden us to handle or touch. For <hi>Rats,</hi> they make all things foul, infectious, and hurtful: and are not only pernicious to eat, but wholly unprofitable to Man in all things. And <hi>Weasels</hi> are a sort of Vermine which are yet fouler, more infectious, and the most filthy and impure of all those we speak of. For they conceive by the Ear, and bring forth their young by the Throat, which is a thing detestable in Men, in what they hear and report, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by the Ear any cursed Folly, to utter and be delivered of the same by the Tongue and Report, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperate the same by Words odious and bitter. Of which oft times there arises cause of great Inconvenience, and that which of it self is nauseous and loathsom, they improve and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify with an elaborate wicked Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by all means possible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:66194:56"/>Wherefore your King, as we have heard,<note place="margin">Calumniators, false Repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or Spies. Some Copies call them Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planists.</note> justly causes such Men to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished capitally. I think (said I then) that by such you mean the <hi>Emphanists</hi>: for the King punisheth those with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hope or Mercy, by Process, with Tortures and Sufferings, and even with an ignominious Death. They are the same, (said <hi>Eleazar</hi>) for their Idleness and Negligence brings no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Men but Mischief, and most dangerous Ruine and Destruction.</p>
               <p>And likewise our Law commands to do no wrong or injury to any Person either by Word or Deed. See then how I advertise you in short, and shew you that all our Demeanours by the Law, are directed to Justice and Equity: and that our holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures allow not any thing that in Appearance is evil, nor ought to be done impertinently and with Choler: But we are commanded that in all our Lives we demean our selves towards
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:66194:57"/>
all Men, in all our Conversations and Deportments, justly and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, as having always in Mind God for the great Judge of Secrets.</p>
               <p>Now to whom could it seem otherwise, but that <hi>Eleazar</hi> had well and pertinently spoken of those fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Vermin, Reptiles, and of other Creatures also; manifesting thereby very properly, that all the Letter of the Law tended to no other end then Justice, and to shape and fashion well the Manners and Dispositions of Men.</p>
               <p>Further, he delivered himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Oblations of Calves, of Sheep, and of Goats, raising there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a fair Discourse: shewing, that it was their custom to select such Beasts from the Folds and Herds, as were Tractable and Tame, to make them their Offerings to God: never offering Sacrifice with wild or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Beasts: because those that made these Oblations, and offered them should not entertain Savage Thoughts,

or be elated with intractable P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Hitherto, <hi>Philocrates,</hi> I have fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to you, by writing these memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, considering the itch you have to learn and to know, which I have done, to the end, that by this little you may understand the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of the Law, the Causes and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Considerations that are therein contained, and now I will return from whence we have Digressed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ELEAZAR</hi> then, after the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were performed, as was customary, having chosen the Persons as is before specified, to send unto the King, he sent him also many rich Presents, which indeed were very splendid. When therefore we had tken leave, and parted from him very friendly, with his Salutation of Peace, and were returned to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> our arrival was forthwith made known to the King. And soon after <hi>Andrea</hi> and my self entred into the Kings Hall, and making most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reverence, we presented to his Majesty the Letters of <hi>Eleazar.</hi> Then the King, overjoyed that the Event of this Voyage had succeeded so well, having obtained the Persons much

to be wisht for, made the Croud of those that attended on their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Suits, to quit the Place; and commanded, that the <hi>Iewish</hi> Doctors should immediately have notice to attend, which was sooner than they expected. For the Custom of the Country is, when any Ambassadors arrive upon any Business they are sent about, it is not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to be presented to the King, unless they are Ambassadors from Kings, or from very Honourable States and Republicks, nor without great difficulty to have Audience, till thirty dayes after their Arrival, and sometimes longer, as the King is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to make a Difference, with regard to the Degree of those that sent them.</p>
               <p>But the King, having cleared the Place of those he judged not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to this Entertainment; continued in the Hall, expecting till the Doctors were presented to make their Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:66194:59"/>Who being introduced, did their Duties in delivering the Presents sent the King from <hi>Eleazar.</hi> Likewise they Presented him with divers Skins of <hi>Parchment,</hi> exceeding fine, smooth, and delicate, bound up with a Bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very rare and uncommon.</p>
               <p>In which Skins was the Divine Law of <hi>Moses</hi> in <hi>Letters of Gold,</hi>

                  </note> and in the <hi>Hebrew Language,</hi> a thing very curious to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</p>
               <p>Upon their presenting them to the King, sitting in his Chair of State, the King presently turned towards them, taking notice of them all one after another; and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them the Volumes of the <hi>Law</hi>: Then they unfolded the Rouls wrapt up in these Skins of Parchment or Vellam aforesaid. Which the King seriously beholding, remained as one transported a pretty space. After which, he adored the <hi>Holy Law</hi> seven times, saying these Words:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66194:59"/>
                  <hi>We give you Thanks, my Masters, and much more him that sent you hither, and the High God above all, of whom these are the Sacred Words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the said Doctors, and all those who were attending the King, let fall great Expressions of Joy with Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and there fell Tears of Joy from the Kings Eyes; as we see many times, that exceeding Transports will draw Tears from the Eyes, especially in Excesses of a more sublime and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Nature.</p>
               <p>Then the King required the Skins and Volumes of the <hi>Law</hi> should be folded up again; which done, he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted the Doctors, saying; Reason requires, grave Sirs, that first we pay you Honour and Regard, in as much as We were the Occasion of your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hither, for which cause we give you our Hand with this Assurance, that this very Day shall be to us the Day, that all the Days of our Life we will hold Great and Memorable, and shall be solemnized every Year

with Feasting; in perpetual Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of your Visit, as also of our Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which we obtained this day against <hi>Antigonus</hi> at Sea, wherefore it is our Will, that this very Day you solace your selves in Feasting with us.</p>
               <p>Forthwith he required the Princes should be invited: Amongst whom he did me the Honour to make me to be seated. Moreover, he caused to be exposed to view, all the rich Furniture, wherewith the Pallace Royal was, upon great Festivals, used to be decked; Likewise he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they should fit up Lodgings near to the Castle, in the most splendid Manner they could; And in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the King ordered, that the Feasts should be set out in the most Sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and Magnificent Fashion that was possible. And then the King enjoyned <hi>Nicanor,</hi> his chief Physitian, to bid <hi>Dorothea</hi> Controuler of the House, (as from the Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his Majesty,) that he should, and that with all Diligence, deliver

out all things necessary for every one of the Doctors, as well for their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, as for the Furniture of their Lodgings, and that without fail, as from the Ordinance and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the King, which was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with accomplished with great dispatch by many Hands, Conformable to the usage of great Cities, when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to make great Feasts and publick Banquetting, whenas there are select<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Officers that are appointed to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish every one according to his Post and Station: Such were the Appointments of the King,<note place="margin">Nature of good Officers and Subjects.</note> who was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to assist in Person, and his People, to speak Truth, were such as spared for no Labour or Pains to execute his Orders; for with all Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity and Cheerfulness they provided whatever was necessary and requisite, putting in execution what the King required, with glad and chearful Hearts. Thus was the Kings Will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:66194:61"/>
and freely comply'd with, in this and all other Regards whatever.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Dorothea</hi> was very Franck and Bountiful, and very Industrious in his Charge and Employment, which was principally to have a due regard to the accommodating these great and venerable Men, not employing what had been formerly Allotted to such Uses, but fresh and valuable Stuffs, spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nothing that was in his Power.</p>
               <p>He assigned every one of them his Couch of Ease, besides his Bed, with fair Carpets, as the King had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Moreover, the King required the half of them should be placed and seated at the Table, so as that they might front his Person, and the other half distributed on each side his Chair of State<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Omitting nothing which any way might do them Honour, or contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to their utmost Content and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
               <p>After the Seats of the Table were duly fixed and proportioned for each; the Kings command to <hi>Dorothea</hi> was,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:66194:61"/>
that all those who came from <hi>Iudea,</hi> should have Victuals distributed, and such as they Affect, after the Usage of their Country, and Appointment of their Law; Nevertheless, that they should want for no Plenty or Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as also for performing their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Vows, and Sacrifices, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Custom of their Nation.</p>
               <p>After all these Ceremonies, the King besought one of them, named <hi>Eleazar,</hi> the most Aged of all those that came with us, to make his Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.

                  <p>YOU ask me, Great King, a most nice Question; for such things as discompose the Mind are out of Rule, since we are sometimes led by our Senses, arising either from what hath past, or from the Objects presenting themselves to our view. Whence many times we fancy in our Dreams, we are sailing upon the Sea, or are passing over Rivers; many times that we fly aloft with Wings, soaring from place to place, and such like things as are ridiculous even to waking Thoughts. Moreover, things to which we have great Appetite and Desire, disturb our Fantasie in Dreams.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, Great King, I am of Opinion, that with all your Might,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:66194:69"/>
in all you say and do, your Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should be purely addressed to Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Holiness, to the end, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severing in that manner, you may be guided and fortified on all sides with Vertue, and so shew your self impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable to all Sensuality. And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, that you never take by force from another what to him belongs of Right; because the things wherein we most engage and employ our selves waking, commonly appear in Phantomes to us again in our Dreams, ins1nuated into our Fansies by the Appetites and Inclinations we had to them: but when you level all your Affections, Operations, and Affairs at the Mark of Virtue and Honesty, then sleeping and waking you will be at ease.

Further, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how you are exposed to Flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who dive into your very Thoughts upon every Change of your Countenance and Carriage, from which they will make use for their own ends: but in this, Great King, you may well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how to demean your self, not submitting your Ear to any Person

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:66194:92"/>
shew'd a Countenance of receiving the greatest Satisfaction and most joyful content.</p>
                  <p>I Have been hitherto <hi>Philocrates,</hi> thus prolix in the recital of the Business, which I have done, for the great esteem I have had of such men, and of their Wisdom: marvelling at the readiness of their Answers, being so pertinent to that which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to them upon the sudden: shewing such Elegance in their Speech, as if these Questions had been long time in premeditation: and that he who proposed them, had thought of them long before he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them: and yet their Answers to him were found so agreeable, as if they had long before consulted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether about them. Wherefore it is no wonder that they seem admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not to me only, but to the Phylosophers also, and to all them that were present, assuring you that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:66194:92"/>
such things are more hard to believe than one would imagine, in which I will not wonder, if the Faith of the Readers be vanquished: For my part, what occasion have I to add Dreams or Falsities, seeing that all which I have Written, is to be found in the Registers of the King, where it is held the greatest of Crimes, to find any untruth in the least thing of the World.</p>
                  <p>I assure you then, that this Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is most true, containing the Discourse of all the things as they have passed in verity, without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any Errour; for to this end, that I might best know the truth, I have used this Diligence to search publick Registers, where we may see recited the Banquets and Feasts, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Interrogations also of the King; and the Answers which were given him, and all even Word for Word; from whence I have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed what I have here Written. For you know it hath been the custom
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:66194:93"/>
to Register and Inroul all that hath been done and said, every day from the time that the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to give Audience,<note place="margin">It was a Custom to Register what was propounded and answered in the Kings of <hi>Egypts</hi> Presence.</note> unto the time He went to Bed, without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any thing that he did, or was said to his Majesty: A course truly, very profitable and well instituted: For by that means the registred Acts of the precedent day being read, if any thing were omitted in what the King had said or done, there might be Opportunity of amendment.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, after I had diligently searched the Day Book of the King, I have collected the same for you, here by Writing, as afore-said; Well knowing the extraordinary great desire you have to understand all remarkable Occurrences.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THree dayes after these Feasts and Disputes were ended, <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> conducted all these Doctors to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea, into an Isle; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon a Bank, passed a Bridg which led towards the <hi>North,</hi> where the place designed for this Assembly was, and where they should hold their Conference for their Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Law.</p>
               <p>It was a House of Pleasant Scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and most magnificent, upon the Banks of the Sea, very stately and curiously decked and trimmed: where, above all Conveniencies, there was great silence for the tranquility of the Spirit, and repose of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. Moreover, there was all things necessary for Life, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully provided and prepared with great convenience and ease.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:66194:94"/>In this place <hi>Demetrius</hi> entreated them they would dispose themselves to the I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>terpretation of the Law, in which they began to proceed, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, and conferring together of every thing, untill they came all to one general accord and consent, to resolve in a true sence advisedly. The which done, they set down in Writing, that which was by them so composed and reduced into good order, the most learnedly, and the most eloquently that they could, by the Advice and Counsell of all, they put it apart, that the same might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards be put into the Hands of <hi>Demetrius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Colloquies and Conferences lasted from the Morning untill nine of the Clock, and so rising from these Disputes, they went to take Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Air for their Health, after all things were sumptuously admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred unto them. For <hi>Dorothea,</hi> who had the same in charge, was therein so careful, that there was nothing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:66194:94"/>
made ready for the Kings Person, but every day they had as much of the same to every single Person, and he would once the day come to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit them with courtship in his own proper Person, and they sometimes went to salute the King with great Reverence, and so return'd to privacy.</p>
               <p>Every Morning it was their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom to make their Prayers to God, after they had wash'd their Hands in the Sea, as the <hi>Iews</hi> customarily use Lavations, and then retir'd to their Readings and Interpretations.</p>
               <p>I was so bold to ask them why they so washed their Hands before they made their Prayers? to which demand they made this Answer: that this washing of the hands did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish them to do nothing wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but to devote all their Actions to Piety, and Sanctity: because that all the Works they did with their Hands might be effected according to Justice, Truth, and Cleanness, as we have before said.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:66194:95"/>To conclude, these Personages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in such Serenity of Air, Beauty of dwelling, Tranquility of Silence, Pleasantness of Repose, and Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Entertainment, finished the Work undertaken: and, which is a note of Admiration, (they had so expresly ordered it among themselves) and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it with such care and diligence, that the Interpretation of the Law was fully finished in the space of 72 Dayes. <hi>Demetrius</hi> then seeing the Translation and Interpretation of the Law was so well and happily brought to an end, used means that the multitude of the <hi>Iews,</hi> then being in <hi>Egypt,</hi> might be convocated to the place where the Work was then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: to whom he shewed how all things had been done, beginning with all Circumstances of the Enterprize, and all in the presence of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters. To the King all the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude attributed great Praise, and gave infinite thanks, for being the mediate cause of so important a good,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:66194:95"/>
and a benefit of such excellency: Likewise they shared a part of the Honour to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> intreating him to shew them that Favour as to have a Copy for their Princes, for to haue their Advice, and to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon the Profit or Damage that might arise upon the same.</p>
               <p>In this sort was the Law review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, re-known, and received in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the Princes of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and of the Multitude, and of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors of Towns. And upon Proclamation made (the seventy two Doctors being present) that all was well and holily Translated, and done after a most exquisite manner: it was provided that nothing thereof should be changed, and that all things should remain in the same estate without alteration of the least thing or tittle.</p>
               <p>As the Translation was thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of all, and the Decree made for the ratification of the same; <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> commanded that according
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:66194:96"/>
to their custom, they should make Imprecations and Maledictions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those which should undertake or should presume to add any thing thereto, or to transferr it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes by changing, effacing, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering any thing whatsoever it were, unto that which was so perfectly now written. And when all was perfected and accomplished in this manner, he ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ured the <hi>Iews</hi> to hold, keep, and preserve it invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably for ever: the which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to do with great Joy and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Demetrius,</hi> finding himself greatly satisfied, especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had been a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor of the Work: and that he had given to the King such Content in the happy execution and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of his charge, and of this his Felicity, made great Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the King. Who having af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with great Diligence perus'd this Interpretation, and considered the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:66194:96"/>
profundity of the Sence of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, which he admired with an astonished regard: he said to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> How comes it to pass that none of the Poets or Historians have put their Hands to this Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is a thing of so high and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Excellency? To which <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> answered, that no body never durst touch it, as well for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of the same, as also that God had forbidden it; so as some having presumed to attempt it, have been chastised with Divine Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: whereupon they have been constrained to desist from their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize: For, as testifieth <hi>Theopom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> which, by a recital of himself, saith, that presuming to transferr in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his History some Secrets of the Holy Law, he was afflicted more then 30 dayes following with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of his Understanding: But calling upon God in the Intervals and Cessations of the most vehement fits of this his Malady, it was told
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:66194:97"/>
him in his sleep, this Punishment was sent him from God, for having presumed to prophane and falsifie things Sacred. So by this Vision he was corrected, repented, and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received his Sences again.</p>
               <p>And, said <hi>Demetrius,</hi> upon mine own knowledge, I affirm, that <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus</hi> a Tragick Poet, willing to usurp something from this Law, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to enrich his Poesie, lost his sight: Nevertheless, advising with himself, and concluding that this his Audaciousness was the cause of his Blindness, prayed to God for many dayes, whereby he came again to Health.</p>
               <p>The King, saying that this was wisely spoken, adored the Law: Commanding that the Books of the same should be preserved the most curiously and carefully that might be possible: and advising with the Interpreters, benignely and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously prayed them, that when they were in <hi>Iudea,</hi> they would often come and see him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:66194:97"/>Finally, he gave order, that they should be honourably returned back and conducted into their Country, promising them, that how oft soever, and when they pleased to return, he would entertain them as his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Friends: so honouring them with fair Presents according to their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and commanding that all things should be made ready for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of their return, using towards them all Royal Magnificence; He gave to every one of them three rich Habilliments, and two Talents of Gold, and an excellent Cup of the weight of a Talent. Moreover, Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture to furnish a Chamber; over and above he sent to <hi>Eleazer</hi> ten Table-beds or Couches of ease, which had the Feet of Silver, and adorned with all that was necessary to the beautifying of them.</p>
               <p>Further, he sent him a Present of thirty Talents of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> that is to say, ten Robes, whereof the one was of Purple; and a fair Crown of an
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:66194:98"/>
hundred Tunicks of <hi>Crespe,</hi> of Viols, of Basins, and two Cups of Gold for the Sacrifices. After, he intreated <hi>Eleazar,</hi> that when any of the said Doctors should desire rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to him, then to remain in <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> that he would not hinder them by any means, for he protested he made great esteem of wise Mens Company; and that he would spare for nothing to draw them to him. In which he should best employ his Riches, to all imaginable Content and Profit, and not, as some Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Princes do, in vain Trifles that profit nothing.</p>
               <p>Behold here, my <hi>Philocrates,</hi> the Present which I promised you; in which I hope, you will take more Pleasure, than in reading vain, fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Narrations, being that you use to whet and sharpen your Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in the Contemplation of the most great and Noble Actions: In which you have imployed much time, which hath given me occasion

now to write you things worthy and excellent, and the best that I could chuse, because that betwixt us I would kindle a kind Contention and Emulation of amiable Vertue, for the desire to have an intelligence of things more worthy to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and which are the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>

               <p>And if we will go more high, and weigh the old Times of the first Age which preceeded the Flood, as we have it from that only History of <hi>Moses</hi> in the Holy Bible: We shall easily perceive that the <hi>Pagan</hi> Poets and Writers have received, even the Ancient Names, and mingled them amongst their Fables and Dreams, and drawn them from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures.</p>

               <p>And that he hath put his hand to the Pen, and began to write his Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of the Creation and Conduct of the World even to his time, and his sacred History and Prophesies touching

the Church of God shall at least be 325 years before all other Writers, of whom there is any mention or news in the World; that is to say, in the year of the World 2513.</p>
               <p>Whereupon we note, even to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, against all those prophane Mockers that have disgorged that enormous Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy amongst others, that the World is eternal and of it self: which if it were, so as they dream, and that it had no such beginning as is written by <hi>Moses,</hi> they might find then by all, and in all Languages, many Histories of infinite times, and many Chronicles of many Ages, and of old times that have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded <hi>Moses</hi> in the account of years.</p>
               <p>But we see that there is no such, and that the holy Bible is found even in the middle amongst all sorts of Enemies that strive to destroy, lose, abolish, burn, and extermine from the World the Books of it, and for all thereto they had so long time, yet nevertheless they never could, nor ever shall. For we see the said Bible yet, in his proper Writing and Language, and of all others of what Nation soever, the most celebrated and renowned: and if they could find any History, which had been written before
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:66194:108"/>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> was born into the World, yet shall it contain their Time and Composition, with more years and ages, as we can ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the holy Scriptures, even to this present year 1633, since the Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Christ.</p>
               <p>The which account of times past from the Creation unto this present year, shall come to amount to 5563 years, but such Histories neither can be found, nor ever were.</p>
               <p>But for <hi>Moses,</hi> and his faithful Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, even prophane Authors and Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> themselves, have been, even as it were, divinely constrained to bear Testimony, maugre their Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Lyes, Dreams, and Disguisings, through and by the invincible force of Truth. And so they have served for Certificates to all Nations of the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and well known Antiquity of him and his Holy Writs.</p>
