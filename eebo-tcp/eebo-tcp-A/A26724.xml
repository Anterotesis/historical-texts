         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:105072:3"/>
which Thanksgivings beeing indeed much advanced by singing of Psalms, it is a thousand pities that the Psalms in use are not by this daie cured of so manie grievous defects and gross absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as have been of long time discovered in them: For although those gross faults were generally corrected by a worthie Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of your Honorable Hous, in an Edition by him put forth manie years ago; yet was that endeavour wholly dashed by a reference to the Assemblie, who, under an opinion of bringing them most strictly to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, made them in manie places more dark and disorder lie then could bee well amended for the present: upon which consideration I was emboldened, with the assent of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Rous</hi> (the first Autor) and with the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of som Godlie Learned men, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a new Translation, both cleer and smooth, and accurately compared with the Original; which having effected &amp; present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it pleased your Honors to refer it to <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> N. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> B.</hi> and Others to review, &amp; report to
<pb facs="tcp:105072:3"/>
the Hous; but they, accounting the said Translation too Poëtical, do intend to compile a new one out of it, more strictly to the words, which doubtless will produce that obscuritie of Phrase, and deformitie of Style, which marr'd the other, and made it less accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and profitable to the People: and for which verie reason this new Composure of mine was more accurately framed, having formerly put forth a Translation of mine own, which was not wholly innocent of that Original error, which indeed the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors do not alwaies so easily apprehend.</p>
            <p>Now, becaus this Review of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee may bee very tedious to wait for, (it beeing a year and more since the Order past the Hous, and I cannot perceiv they are half waie in the work) and when it is don, it must needs varie from the express Text by Paraphrase or Metaphrase, for a great part; and becaus the Opportunities are becom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Importunities, and very urgent, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to dedicate to your Honors this short <hi>Assaie of Psalms and Hymns,</hi> beeing
<pb facs="tcp:105072:4"/>
readie to print and publish the whole Book, if it pleas your Honors to allow mee the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie of my Copie, that no man print it from mee, and those that are interessed therein; without which favor, the present printing of the whole would endanger my utter undoing, having already endebted my self so deeply upon the said account: But if after publication of all, your Honors shall receiv better satisfaction by anie other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, I shall fully rest satisfied in this, that it shall bee determined by the Supreme Autoritie of England, which, from the first, I have publickly owned, obeied, honored, praied for, pleaded for, and praised God for, as a singular Blessing to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>under which wee may lead peaceable and quiet lives in all Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Honestie; and if anie</hi> fearing God <hi>bee otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto them.</hi> In consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and confidence whereof, I rest</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE poor and imperfect Translation of the present <hi>Psalm-Book</hi> (not yet throughly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by anie hand) gave occasion to som to saie more wittily then wisely, That <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Sternhold</hi> had persecuted <hi>David</hi> more then <hi>Saul</hi> did, and hath made som men to abhor the offering of the Lord: Yet those Autors did rarely (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less) for those Times, and are registred in Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles among men of Note, and their labors have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly edified Godlie men, and glorified God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in these Times of glittering Knowledg, and the perfection of Language and other Gifts, the great defects and faults of these Psalms crie aloud for amendment; and certainly when once vvee have in our flock <hi>a male,</hi> I mean, a compleat Book, Mal. 1. 14. then to offer these <hi>lame</hi> and <hi>blinde</hi> Psalms, and so to sacrifice a corrupt thing, will bee cursedly evil: but to desert the Dutie wholly (since som Psalms are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably translated) is certainly a sin. I conjecture with my self what hath more prejudiced this Dutie, then the weakness of the Translation; namely, the wicked application of Psalms by malevolent Spirits, as I heard somtime a Hedg-priest give forth the 21 Psalm, at such time as the Book of Sports was commanded to bee read, to the grieving of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the godlie: Nevertheless this wicked purpose did not corrupt God's Ordinance, though (to their sin onely) it did abuse it, lest by that argument wee should forfeit all praier and preaching.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105072:7"/>These I saie are the true causses of the decaie of the most heavenlie Dutie and Exercise of that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of <hi>Psalm</hi>-singing; yet lest the amendment of the Psalm Book, and of the Times themselvs by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal and powerful reformation, should reduce Christians to that Primitive Dutie of singing Psalms, Satan hath suggested som wittie scruples amongst godlie spirits, which for present satisfaction and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture preparation of good Christians, I shall hope, though briefly, yet clearly and fully to answer.</p>
            <p>I. It is objected that they cannot <note place="margin">Psal. 131. 44. 119.</note> saie <hi>they are not puft in minde; Wee have not gon back from thee. I have kept thy Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies with my whole heart, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Every true Christian can saie so in som measure, or in som sens, 1 Joh. 2. 27. <hi>You have an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing that teacheth you all things—and even as it hath taught you, yee shall abide in him.</hi> Gal. 5. 24. <hi>Those that are Christ s have crucified the flesh, with the affections and Iusts thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Thou oughtest yet to learn to bee able to saie so; Col. 3. 16. <hi>Teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and Hymns, &amp;c.</hi> Hee that take's special notice of his lesson begin's to learn it.</p>
            <p>II. They object, that is not proper for them to saie, <hi>Whenas wee sale in Babylon: I will divide Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Are they not yet in <hi>Babylon</hi> think you? Sure if God have called his people out of <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> 18. 4. they (at least) were in it. As for <hi>Sechem,</hi> and such like, <hi>David</hi> glorie's in his Conquests, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:105072:7"/>
hee is both a Type of <hi>Christ,</hi> (in whose Conquests wee are made partakers) and of the Church; and his Temptations and Deliverances do in a Figure represent ours. As <hi>Paul</hi> saith, Heb. 11. 19. That <hi>Abraham received his son from death in a Figure,</hi> and that <hi>Mount Sion and Mount Sinai, Sarah and Hagar, were an Allegorie,</hi> Galat. 4. ver. 24.</p>
            <p>III. Som object, that more pertinent expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions may bee used by Psalms composed on purpose, and of our own invention, as they did in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. You cannot shew so much Scripture, that they used unscriptural Psalms, as wee can, that they did use Scriptural; For <hi>Psalms and Hymns and Spiritual Songs</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> commands to bee used, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. are proper terms of the O. Test. Psalms, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Cotton</hi> fully proveth in his defence of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. And if our Saviour did allude to the Jewish Custom of Thanksgiving at the Sacrament, as <hi>Weems</hi> saith, wee think no less at his singing of an Hymn, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 30. whereas they have not a word to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the custom of unscriptural Psalms.</p>
            <p>2. When the Psalms were first penned by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> som were Histories of Ancient matters, 77, 78, 114, 135. and manie more: Som were Prophecies of things to com, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 79, 85, 126. and others; yet the Spirit of God thought fit to edifie the present generation with the Records and Meditation of past and future things, yea, Were not these best of all for such uses? Was it not most sweet to them in times of Invasion and Hostilitie, to call to minde God's protecting, prospering, and avenging of <hi>Israël</hi> coming out of <hi>Egypt, Psal.</hi> 114. and 136? And are not
<pb facs="tcp:105072:8"/>
these things written for our learning as well as theirs? <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. yea consider if our Invention can equal the pat and pertinent expressions taken out of Scripture upon all occasion: for then certainly wee should bee to seek for Texts, as much as for Psalms.</p>
            <p>IV. Som object, that none can render the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture into Vers, but must needs varie from the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, in the signification of manie words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> So they must do also in the prose Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For that which is elegant in the Hebrew, would bee Barbarism, at least Soloecism in our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, as abundantly appear's by <hi>Ainsworth's</hi> Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>2. Somtimes by means of the latitude of Poësie, more full and proper significations may bee expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, then in the prose Translation, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 6. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>To know with favor; Psal.</hi> 118. 22. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>To refuse with disgrace; Psal.</hi> 106. 38. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>To shed abundantly,</hi> and hundreds such, which the Prose doth more sparingly.</p>
            <p>3. Consider the propertie and nature of Vers, that if <hi>David</hi> had Translated his own Psalms, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression must have been different in another Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, though to the same effect, and the Spirit of God (using the Translation of the LXX) much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie's the Words of the Old Testament. And if I had as much to spare as I have spent about the work, I could easily demonstrate, out of uncontrouled au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, how closely I have followed the Original, though now I must content my self with on Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, and putting forth som special Hebraïsms in a Capital letter.</p>
            <p>Lastly, som object that they dare not sing, becaus
<pb facs="tcp:105072:8"/>
of a mixed multitude, that, they saie, curs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> And therefore vvee shall not bless God and his Church; Surely their faults cannot bee charged upon us, if they should sing damnation to themselvs.</p>
            <p>2. The same objection would denie us all Praier, and spiritual Communion, which is not so far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them now adaies, but should they com in as strangers, they could not pollute the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance nor the Church, and the majestie of it might bee blessed to their good. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 14, 25.</p>
            <p>To them that imagine one should sing the Psalm and the rest hear, it is but an imagination, and that groundless; Where's your Scripture for it? Wee learn thence to join Voices as well as Votes, <hi>Psalm</hi> 34. 3. <hi>Com and let us exalt his Name together.</hi> Psal. 66. 4. <hi>All the earth shall worship Thee, and shall sing unto Thee, they shall sing unto Thy Name.</hi> Yet it might suffice to answer such fond surmises vvith 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16. <hi>Wee have no such custom, nor yet the Churches of God.</hi>
