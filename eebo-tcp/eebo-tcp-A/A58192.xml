            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </l>
               <l>I wait without comparison,</l>
               <l>Great difference is in our pen</l>
               <l>And something in the Maids and Men,</l>
               <l>I do not write to get a name</l>
               <l>At best, this is but Ballad-fame,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Suckling</hi> hath shut up that door,</l>

               <l>He'd shift his scaene I trow,</l>
               <l>From <hi>Charing-cross</hi> to <hi>Clarkenwel</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And sure as fine a Tale would tell,</l>
               <l>As he did long agoe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But since his wit hath left no heir</l>
               <l>Ile sing my song of such a pair,</l>
               <l>The like hath not been seen,</l>
               <l>In all our markets round about</l>

               <l>The youth I was about to name</l>
               <l>But 'twere too much to lessen fame,</l>
               <l>So known of such a grace,</l>
               <l>Who 'mongst the ladds and lasses too,</l>
               <l>There's none who makes a greater doo,</l>
               <l>At e'ry game and chase.</l>

               <l>The brightest ladies in the court,</l>
               <l>Were surely much afraid,</l>
               <l>Least she appearing should displace,</l>
               <l>The vogue of any better face,</l>

               <l>Are not concern'd, what others doo,</l>
               <l>Under an humble Vne,</l>
               <l>Both sitting, in one instant say,</l>
               <l>(Too long) to morrow will the day,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Poor innocents they knew not why,</l>
               <l>Yet would with one another lie,</l>
               <l>Their thoughts were grown so great</l>
               <l>And Poetiz'd their fancy,</l>
               <l>That they immortaliz'd should grow,</l>

               <l>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:98513:69"/>
And measur'd time by thought,</l>
               <l>Their cloaths by custome they put on,</l>
               <l>And hand in hand walk'd fast along</l>
               <l>So found the Priest they sought.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The holy-man forgot his book</l>
               <l>And now and then he stole a look,</l>
               <l>As oft about to pray,</l>
               <l>Believing something there inshrin'd,</l>
               <l>So much transcending humane kind,</l>
               <l>He knew not what to say.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But fearing that he might offend</l>
               <l>The Saint so newly made his friend,</l>
               <l>Dispatcht what he begun,</l>
               <l>The Bride and Bridegroom left the place,</l>
               <l>As they had been to run a race,</l>

            <lg>

               <l>As if it were some hue and cry,</l>
               <l>Forsook their houses quite,</l>
               <l>And by pursuing came at last</l>
               <l>To find the doors and windows fast,</l>
               <l>VVhere they had made their flight.</l>

               <l>The guests invited to the day</l>
               <l>Came there, but knew not what to say,</l>
               <l>It was so strange a thing,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:98513:69"/>
No meat nor musick, favours, gloves,</l>
               <l>Posset nor cakes to shew their loves,</l>
               <l>The Bride had but a Ring.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus full three daies and nights are fled,</l>
               <l>Since that the sheapherds took their bed,</l>
               <l>'Twas time I trow to rise,</l>
               <l>For mortaliz'd they are agen,</l>
               <l>And call for meat like other men,</l>
               <l>Nature must have supplys.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Prae-invited guests came in</l>
               <l>Like those who had intranced been,</l>
               <l>None gave that daies salute,</l>
               <l>Seeing the blushing sheapherds sit,</l>
               <l>Like our first Parents, for a bit</l>
               <l>Of the forbidden fruit.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But then a matron ag'd threescore,</l>
               <l>Though truly told, full twenty more,</l>
               <l>Thus to the Bridegroom saies,</l>
               <l>But not asham'd thou hast done well</l>
               <l>And doing often is a spell,</l>
               <l>All women love to praise.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The married, and the maids applause,</l>
               <l>Soon known by hems at e'ry clause,</l>
               <l>The scene is alter'd quite,</l>

For now the house with noise doth ring,</l>
               <l>In e'ry tongue and tail a sting,</l>
               <l>For such another night.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Souldier who at push of pike,</l>
               <l>Saies one, stands longest I doe like,</l>
               <l>And thrusts, and thrusts agen;</l>
               <l>Another cries, I love the brunt</l>
               <l>And brave induring in the front,</l>
               <l>Give me such sprightly men.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But then a blushing maid replys,</l>
               <l>My father told my mother lyes,</l>
               <l>And so may others doe;</l>
               <l>He promis'd her, the Seamans vow,</l>
               <l>But he perform'd the Lord knows how,</l>
               <l>And glad she had it too.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now supper call'd the Musick playes</l>

               <l>The Bride and Groom had more to doe,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>But stay the maids, now claim a right</l>
               <l>A custome, (yet) of much despight,</l>
