         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DECLARATION OF THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY OF THE COUNTY of VVORCESTER Adhering to the late KING.</head>
            <p>HAving under our preſent conſideration and proſpect (though not without much horror and amazement) the vaſt and waſting confuſions under which theſe Nations for many years have languiſhed, out of which diſtreſſed and miſerable condition we judge it impoſſible to be redeemed without the only aide of that omnipotent hand, which hath juſtly ſent theſe afflicting chaſtiſements for our multiplyed offences againſt his Divine Majeſty.</p>
            <p>And conſidering farther how the Divine Clemency by late and wonderfull Revolutions, (wherein his Excellency the Lord Generall <hi>Monck,</hi> being to his perpetuall honour moſt ſignally inſtrumentall,) hath revived our hopes of re-obtaining the bleſſings of Peace and Re-ſettlement, if we can become ſuch good Chriſtians, as to have mutuall mercy one for another, deſiring no otherwiſe to be our ſelves forgiven, then as we do freely and heartily forgive.</p>
            <p>We therefore, the Nobility and Gentry of the County of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> having as deeply taſted of the ſad cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of theſe late Inteſtine Warres, as any other of our neighbour-Counties, and to the increaſe of our unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe do yet lye under the ſevere and heavy cenſure of ſome perſons who aſperſe us as full of Revenge.</p>
            <p>Do nevertheleſſe hereby declare before God and the world, that we neither do nor will harbour any thought of Rancor or Revenge againſt them or any other perſon which hath been of a contrary judgement unto us, But are moſt readily willing to lay aſide all kind of Animoſities whatſoever, and returne into all mutuall Chriſtian love and friendſhip; whereby we may with them Redintegrate into the Unity of Mind, as well as of Nation: Preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming alſo, that all ſuch who have not totally ſtrai'd from the pathes of charity, will in this believe us.</p>
            <p>And that we may not be wanting to give a full Teſtimony and Aſſurance of our quiet and peaceable deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the future; with an humble and unwearied patience, we wait for the bleſſing of our great and gracious God upon this enſuing Parliament.</p>
