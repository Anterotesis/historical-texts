         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the more difficile &amp; hard it is. For the

Iehu the kynge of the Israelites
when he had remoued all grosse and

swerde had taken away all the Ido<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lolatricall
priestes. iii. Reg. x, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
of God, neuertheles because
he walked not in the lawe of God
wyth all his herte, and lefte not the

speaketh Elias the Prophet,
iii. Reg. xviii. Howe longe sayth he
wyl ye halt on both sides. If y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord

If y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> priesthod &amp; ministery of Christe

holy, &amp; absolutely perfect, receiue it:
in case it be not, folow y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> pope. Christ
can not abide to haue the leue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the

For he accuseth God of ignorancie

what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil of god is: So hath

ignoraunte and far from God,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei. He perswaded in those

neither to loke it in Aegipt nor

               <p>It is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lest help that the
reder or teacher of ani prophet
or other part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scriptur shal

vnder what king, in what state
of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he purposith to interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate:
al these things as touchi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
our Ionas, is declared in the
iiii. booke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings, the. xiiii.
cap. He liued in Samaria vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
an Idololatrical king Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam,
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne of Ioas, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4404:17"/>
And thys Ionas labored in
the ministery of Gods word at
one tyme, wyth Amos, Oseas,
and Ioell the true Prophetes
of God. The state and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of the commone wealthe,
was troublous and verye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet,
forbecause y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Israelits bi
their Idololatri in folowing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
learning inuented by man, and
leuing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of god, God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshed
them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many greate &amp;
cruel warres, Yet after hys ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
pytye and compassio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vpon those that he punysheth,
to remoue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> occasion that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
gods yre and displeasure,
he sent them dyuers tymes his
holy Prophetes, that shoulde
cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from theyr Idololatry
and corrupt lyuyng as Elias,
Elizeus, and this our Prophet
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:4404:17"/>
Ionas, but all in vayne: they
wold be noughty Idololatres
and vicious lyuers continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
mawgree gods heade, and
would (as we now adayes, for
the most parte do) rather geue
faythe vnto the Prophetes of
men, and lyars, then vnto the
Prophetes of god, that be true
men: But ther reward was (as
ours shalbe, except we amende)
vtter destruccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and losse both
of them selues, and theyr com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
wealthe. The commone
wealth and state of Israel and
Iuda, thus troublouslye being
afflicted, the commaundement
of god came vnto thys oure
Ionas, that he sholde go to the
great Citie of Niniue, as the
text saith. In the which words
note fyrste that no man can, or
<pb facs="tcp:4404:18"/>
may teach truly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of god,
but he be called ordynarylye,
or extraordinarily. Ordinarily
wher as is no corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the
ministery in the church, neither
in doctrine, neither in the right
ministracion of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
whyche be as seales and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
of Gods holy worde.
Wher as this integritie I say
remayneth in the Churche, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ought w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the hygher powers to
intrude or appoynt hym self to
preache, or minister, as it was
in Moses tyme and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stelles.</p>
               <p>Extraordinaryly is, when
immediatelye any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is called
by God, wher as the ministery
of the church is corrupted, as it
was in the tyme of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> prophets
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:4404:18"/>
and of Christ, that called to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
such as the common face
and greatest multitude of the
worlde, woulde not admitte, no
not the hygh byshop, and those
that then were called the holye
churche, as is to be seene by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,
Ionas, Hieremie, Moses
and Paule, wyth other. They
are to be rebuked therfore that
intrudeth and put them selues
wythout lawful callynge into
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ministerye of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, other
wyth money, or praier, and bye
them selues into the Churche,
which thing through al papis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
is aco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon practyse &amp; day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vsed thinge. For in case they
sought not of their bishopprik
more ryches and honoure, then
the necessari trauels &amp; labours
that be annexed vnto the voca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cacion,
<pb facs="tcp:4404:19"/>
they woulde not stryue
so sore who might lepe vp first
to the bishoppes and persones
vocacion. Ther woulde not so
many princes contend, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
for the seate of Rome, the
nest of abhominacion. If ther
were not in it rather the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monye
of Iudas and Simon
Magus, then the laboure of
Christ &amp; Peter, more ease then
payne, more ryches then bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
The Text saith: that thys
prophet beyng called by God,
was sente to Niniue. Of thys
cityes originall, reade the .x. of
of Gen. It was the chiefe citie
of the Assiria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, vnto the whych
Ionas was sent and the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracion
therof, that in case the
heade Citye be well instructed
of a realme, there is the better
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:4404:19"/>
hope of all the reast. Therfore
god hath vsed from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge
of common wealthes to
be mercyfull vnto the greatest
cities therof, and hath sent the
most preachers of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> truithe, as
it is to be seene in these dayes,
what God hathe shewed vpon
London. And as he offereth
them fyrste the tokens of hys
merci, so first he reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth their
vnkyndnes wyth hys punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(if they neglect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
the grace offered.) It is
to be noted that thys Cytye of
Niniue was Idololatrycall,
and Gentelyshe, neuer vnder
the dysciplyne and doctryne of
Moses.</p>
               <p>Yet vnto it sendeth the lord
his Prophet to declare vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4404:20"/>
Iewes that the Ceremonies &amp;
workes of the law, wherof they
most gloried and extolled them
selues, were not necessari to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacion,
but geuen for a time to
excercise theyr obedience in the
commaundement of God. And
to trust in Christe of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their
rites &amp; sacrifices were fygures
and shadowes of: further the
Lorde declareth by thys em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage
vnto Niniue, that the
ignoraunte and supersticious
Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tils be more redy to receaue
the lyuing worde of God, then
the harde harted Iewes: As it
is to be sene at thys prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t day.
More easie it is to conuert vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God ten symple and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt

bene broughte vp, &amp; is wedded
to the vngodlye doctryne and
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:4404:20"/>
tradycions of men. Moreouer
the Lord in sekyng the wealth
of these Assitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, declareth that
he is not onelye the God of the
Iewes, but also of the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tils.
Rom. iii. Act. x. The text decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to what ende Ionas was
sent to the Citye. What to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

out agaynst it. That is to say,
playnlye and openlye to shewe
Gods pleasure vnto them: and
not agaynst one or twoo of the

marke to know the byshoppes
and ministers of god, from the
mynisters of the deuyll: by the
preachyng tounge of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and not by shauyng, clyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng,
vestyments and vtward
apparel. The text maketh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to an obieccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that myght
be demaunded wherefore God
woulde sende Ionas, a man of
base sorte, to rebuke so greate
a kyng wyth hys councell and
common wealth.</p>
               <p>Because theyr syns
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:4404:21"/>
are come vp before the
face of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Of thys aunswer we learn
three thynges. The fyrste that
the Lorde seyth, marketh, and
is displeased wyth our sinnes,
althoughe we lyue in al securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and careles, as though oure
synnes offended God nothyng
at all. The seconde, as manye
tymes as God sendeth suche
Preachers, as wythoute feare
sheweth vnto the world Gods
woorde, and punyshmente for
synne, that theyr synne is full
rype, and that they must either
amende at the preachynge, or
vtterlye to peryshe vnder the
plage, and scourge of God.</p>
               <p>Thus Noah was preacher
before the flood, Ionas before
<pb facs="tcp:4404:22"/>
the destruccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Niniue, Loth
of Sodome, Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
of Hierusalem. Seyng
nowe that God hathe sent hys
worde, hys king, his magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
and hys Preachers into
England, it is (take hede of it)
a very token, that the sinnes of
Englande is ascended vp into
hys sight, and that out of hand
we amend, or sodenlye to looke
for the most seuere &amp; cruel pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshment
of God. Al men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
that synne neuer so abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but none of vs say it is I
that prouoke the Ire of God.
and I wil ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. The nobilitie
putteth al the fault in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the people in the nobilitye,
in the Bishops, marchauntes,
priestes, and other. But wil ye
he iudged, at one worde by the
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:4404:22"/>
testimony of a noble wise man.
Noble Esay the prophet saith:
The Oxe knoweth hys Lord,
and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Asse hys owners stable,
wo is me, ye sinful people, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
laden with iniquitie, a sede
malicious, lost childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ye haue
forsaken the Lord, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one of Israel ye haue prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
as Esay. i. Let euery man
looke vpon hym selfe, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
hys synne, and studye to
amend it from the hyghest to
the lowest, for the Lord is redy
to smyte.</p>
               <p>The thyrd doctryne oute of
thys place is a descripcion of
Gods nature, and longe suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce
towards kyngdomes,
realmes, publicke and priuate
persons, for wher as he myght
most iustlye punyshe and take
<pb facs="tcp:4404:23"/>
vengeaunce vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs for synne,
he is yet so mercyfull that he
premonysheth, &amp; forewarneth
of hys scourge to come, by hys
prophets, Apostles, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
and wylleth the worlde
to amende: in case they so do, he
wyl turne hys Ire from them,
if they wyl not, no remedye but
vtter destruccion, as ye maye
read. Gene. vii. of the flud. Ge.
xix. of Sodomme. Exo. xiiii. of
Pharo. But let vs rather fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the Niniuits
and amende, then the example
of the Aegiptians, and perish.
Thus much is to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hede
of, in the legacye of Ionas in
the fyrste parte of the chapter.</p>
               <p>Now foloweth the seconde

               <p>
                  <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:4404:23"/>
Wher vpon Ionas
rose to fly from the face
of the lord into Thar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
&amp; came to Iapho,
&amp; founde a shyp pressed
towards Tharsis, pai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
his passage, he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
into her, to come wyth
them vnto Tharsis.</p>
               <p>Ionas was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to cry
&amp; preach against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Niniuites,
but being afeard, &amp; suspecting
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> difficulty of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vocacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, flyith
an other way. Here first ar two
things to be noted: whether he
flyeth, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he flieth, the
text saith he fledde to Tharsis,
which some me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sea cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led

true opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Tharsis is the
citi caled Tunes, or Carthage.
<pb facs="tcp:4404:24"/>
Iapho is the citie called Iop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,
a haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> towne in Palestina.
He flieth from the face of God,
that is to wyte from the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolente
and mercyful god that
appoynted hym to the vocaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of preachyng. Of thys text
we learne manye Godlye doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines.
First, how hard &amp; diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
a vocacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is, to be a prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cher,
that incase he be not wyth
a synguler mercy of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
and strengthned, he can
not, nor is it possyble he shuld
preach truly Gods word, as it
is to be sene by Moses. Ex. v.
vi. Esay. vi. Hier. i.ii. Math. x.
and in thys ye may see the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
betwene the ministerye
of God, &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> deuil, of Christ,
and of Antechrist. Christs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
is ful of labors, paines
<pb n="xiiii" facs="tcp:4404:24"/>
sclounders, and calamytyes.
Antichrist is ful of care, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, &amp; honoures:
as ye maye see through all the
kingdom of the Pope, for ther
is not a byshoppricke nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice

Yea, and healpe awaye the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
wyth an Italion figge
before tyme, as ye may rede of
Uictor the thyrd. The seconde
doctryne is, that who so euer
leaueth vndone the office com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
vnto him by god, fli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from the fauour and good
wyl of God, as it is to be sene.
i. Regu. xv. Here be al bishops
and priestes admonished to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
how they leaue their deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and cures. They flie from
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> face of god as many as beare
<pb facs="tcp:4404:25"/>
that name and preache not the
word of God, and instruct not
the people after the mouthe of
god. Myserable and cursed is
our tyme of gods owne mouth
that ther be such dom bishops,
vnpreaching prelats, and such
asseheadded Mynysters in the
church of God. Christ institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tid
nether singers, nor massers,
but preachers, and testimonies
of his true doctrine. Mar. xvi.
Mat. xxviii. Luk. xxiiii. Act. i.
He that leaueth thys doctryne

xxxiii. iii.</p>
               <p>I wyll requyre theyr losse

commaunded so to do vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
paine eternal of his soule, and
Paule sayth: wo be vnto me, if
I preache not. i. Cor. ix. Let all
men take heede to do the thing
that apparteyneth to theyr of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyce,
least they depart from the
face of the Lord, as kyngs do,
if they make any laws contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

lawe of nature, or suffer theyr
subiectes to be tawght in anye
doctryne for the saluacion of

               <p>The iustyce departeth from

               <p>But a man might say: toush,
it is not so great a matter, if a

neyther yet is god so much

may soone be corrected, if
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider the daungers
that thys poore man Ionas
fell into, for hys dysobedyence.
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:4404:26"/>
They be in number syxe. The
fyrste is the perylous wyndes
that troubleth the shippe. The
seconde, hys synne and dysobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
is detected and made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
by lottes. The thyrd, he is
examyned what he is. The
fourthe, he is constrayned to
geue sentence of death agaynst
hym selfe. The fyfth, the ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
cannot saue him. The sixt,
he is cast into the sea.</p>
               <p>The fyrst daunger hath two

daunger of the shyppe. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shewith how the mariners
behaueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues in the time
of theyr daunger. Of the fyrst,
thus sayth the Prophet.</p>
               <p>The Lorde hurled a

sea, and there arose a

               <p>Well we maye thyncke to
escape the daunger of GOD
though we neglect oure dewty
and vocacion, but truely it can
not be so. Whither sayeth Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyd
shoulde I go from thy spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rite,
and whither shoulde I fle

is no corner of the world wher
in man maye hyde hym selfe
from the knowlege and punish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment

hath all thynges in hys hand,

               <p>Of thys place of the text, we

procedeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sheweth howe the
mariners behaued them selues
in this dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whych thyng
is dylygently to be noted. For
in them is expressed averi liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
ymage of all men that lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyth
fayth, howe they feare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
measure in the tyme of
trouble. Theyr doinges is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
foure waies: First their
fayth. Second, eche of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his own god. Third,
thei exonerate the ship. Fourth
they wake Ionas oute of hys
sleepe.</p>
               <p>The fear, declareth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the daunger they were
in, &amp; theyr ignoraunce of God,
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:4404:28"/>
who onelye comforteth in the
dayes and houre of trouble.</p>
               <p>That euery man calleth vpon
his own god, it appeareth ther
were people of sondry and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
nacions, and also what is
common to all men vnder the
sunne that haue not lost the vse
of reason when we be left desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of humane healpe, we call
vpon god, not for loue, but for
feare, as it is sayd: metus primus
in orbe Deos fecit. That is to say:
feare was the fyrste that made
Gods in the world. These ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
are of some part to be fo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lowed,
of some part not, that in
the daye of trouble they praye,
we ought to folowe them: that
they praye not to the one and
sole God, but euerye man to a
sondrye God, they maye not be
<pb facs="tcp:4404:29"/>
folowed. For there is but one
patron and helper for all men,
and he is neuer nor no where
knowen but by his word. Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
reason knoweth ryght wel
in the tyme of trouble that ther
is a god, but who he is reason
cannot tell. Therefore worship<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peth
reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an idole of hys own
heade, vnder the name of God,
and then foloweth man, eyther
hys owne opinion, eyther the
tradicion of hys elders. And
thys is the fountayne of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrye,
when that euery manne
thyncketh hym to be hys God,
that he hym selfe, hys elders, or
custome hath taken to be god.
From hence came suche diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitye
of gods among the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
&amp; so many patrons among
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> supersticious sort of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
These goddes all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>They lyghten the shyp when
they felt that prayers auayled
nothynge, they tourne to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure
whyche also eased them
nothynge. Whereby we learne
that al gods and goddesses be
but vanitye, sauynge oure god
the father of Iesus Christe.</p>
               <p>And no laboure nor trauayl a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayleth
wyth out the fauoure
of God. Luke. ix. The woman
had spente all she had on Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicions,
yet nothyng the better:
so doeth the Papistes in Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and yet theyr conscience no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge
more deliuered from
synne, and those that praye to
Saynctes attayneth nothyng.
If theyr requeste be sometyme
graunted theym, it is none
<pb facs="tcp:4404:30"/>
other then a punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their
Idololatry .ii. Thessa. ii. The
fourth thing thei do, they wake
Ionas.</p>
               <p>But Ionas gate him
vnder y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hatches wher
he laied him down and
slombred.</p>
               <p>The text noteth two things:
one that Ionas slept: the other
how the mariners awoke hym
to call vpon hys God. Ionas
slepe sygnifyeth two thynges.
Fyrst, that when we thynk our
selues most at reast: then be we
moste in daunger, as it is to be
sene by Baltheser in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> prophet
Daniell, and Math. xxiiii.ii.
Thess. ii. Luke. xii. The second
is, to declare the nature of syn,
whyles it is a committyng the
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:4404:30"/>
prycke and daunger thereof is
not felte, but it delyteth rather
man: So without feare, eat A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
and Eue the apple, Peter
denyed Christe. And because
God, out of hande punyshethe
not out synne, the deuyl bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
our myndes, and wyttes,
and beareth vs in hande, that
he wyl neuer punysh, and that
God seythe not oure synne, nor
is not so greuouselye offended
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> oure sinnes. So yet slepeth
the synne at thys daye of them
that persecute God and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
word. The synnes of false or
negligent Byshops and prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes,
the synne of the corrupte
iudges, and sedycious people:
but it wyll awake one daye as
ye may read Gen. iiii. and here
by our Ionas. At the houre of
<pb facs="tcp:4404:31"/>
oure death synne wyll awake,
and wyth oure owne synne the
deuyl wyl kyl vs eternally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte
we awake betime. That
they desier Ionas to praye vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
hys God, it declareth that al
Idololatrye and supersticious
persons thyncke one god to be
stronger then the other. As it
is to be seen in papistrie at this
presente day, where as it is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
which ladye is best, oure
Ladye of Bullayne, or our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
of Rome. Sayncte Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
in Italye, or Sayent Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
at Compostella? Father
this text declareth that Idolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
alwayes seeke newe god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
where as theyr olde god de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deiueth
theym, so is it amonge
Christians when the matter is
playne desperat, they lot y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:4404:31"/>
betwene three, or foure Ido<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lolatrycal
Pilgrimages which
one of them shalbe the Patron
of his health. Wher as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word
of God is knowen, there is no
sute but vnto one god by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diacion
of Christe: Beside who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
there is no health. Thys God
I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend vnto you: vnto thys
god make youre prayers, for
sake that heretical doctrin that
deuideth your hartes in prayer
part to god, and part to saynts
departed. For god is sufficient
to helpe and wyl healpe alone.

other that: One
to a priuate, an other to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke
vocacion, and eche of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
eyther is lawful, or vnlawfull.
That is vnlawfull that fygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
and repugneth wyth the
word of God, as the vocacion
of baudes, Idololatres, masse
mongers, common receauers,
and mainteiners of disers, and
dysse houses wyth suche lyke.
In these, or any lyke, who soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

dampnacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The other vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacion
is lawfull, and standeth
wyth the word of God. Of the
whiche S. Paule speaketh.
In what vocacion any man is
called, in the same let hym a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde.
But thys lawfull voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
we transgresse, two maner
of wayes. Ether when we bear
the title or name of the vocaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and do nothyng appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thereunto (whyche is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned
by God in that he
commaunded in Adam al men
to auoyde ydlenes. Gene. iii. in
the sweate of thy browes thou
shalt eat thy bread: and Paule
i. Thess. ii. Thess.) Either whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
we do, in the vocacion that we
should not do. As for example
a bishop to teach false doctrine
<pb facs="tcp:4404:33"/>
for a true. A iudge that should
iudge truely corrupteth iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente
for fauoure or monye.
A Merchaunte to waxe richer
by false contractes, or corrupte
wares. Into what daunger ech
manne falleth that anye waye
transgresseth hys vocacion, it
is to be sene by thys oure Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,
who in voidyng of one da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger
falleth into sixe, as ye haue
hearde before: of the whych six,
we haue spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but of one. And
in the one noted manye, &amp; profi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>table

cannot healpe it selfe, not from
the daungers of the body as of
the power and good wil of god
that can &amp; wil saue, boeth from
the daungers of bodye &amp; soule.
<pb n="xxiiii" facs="tcp:4404:33"/>
Al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> confesse hym to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true
God, that can and wil helpe al
dyseases, the Iewes, the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
the Gentiles, the good, the
bad. But therein standeth the
daunger, lest for the true God
we cal and inuocat a false god:
and vnder the name of god we
honoure, and worshyp the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel,
as these mariners dyd, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
eche of them called to a sondry
god. And as the Gentiles doth
that Dauid speketh of. Psal.
cvi. that they sacrificed their
children to the deuyl, and not
to God. Dauyd sayeth they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to the deuyll that they
thoughte was offered to God.
And Paule. i. Corinthians. x.
calleth the religion of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
the table of the deuyll:</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4404:34"/>
So dyd the Iewes before
vs, &amp; so do they in these dayes
now, that for eueri disease, they
haue a so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry god and patrone.
For the pestilence S, Roch, for
the war S. Barbara, In thys
daunger of Idololatrye be all
they that call vpon God, and
pray vnto hym otherwyse then
he hath appointid by his word
And here we be admonished of
two things. The fyrst, that we
offer none other obsequie and
relygion vnto god, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hym<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe
by hys word requireth. If
we do, we offer an ydol of oure
own heade, and honore the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel,
vnder the parso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and name
of god. As those doth that erect
and buylde vp Images, and
aulters to saye masse vpon, in
the honor of god, whyche God
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:4404:34"/>
neuer commaunded. Exod. xxii
Deutrono. v. The nexte we be
here admonished of, is that we
call vpon God onelye in the
name of Christe, for he is the
dore, the waye, and the trueth.
Iohn. x. And he alone she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
vs the father. Iohn .i.vi.
Heare be condemned not
onely the Iewes and Gentiles
but also as manye as woulde
knowe, and come to the father
by inuocacion of the saynctes
departed, by Bulles, Pardons
Peregrinacions, Masse and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Let thys erroure, be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
And let vs leue calling
euerye man to hys owne God,
and call onely vpon the onelye
God that can and wil in Christ
heare vs, as he hearde the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches,
Prophetes, and the
<pb facs="tcp:4404:35"/>
Apostles. And y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thys be doone
it is the office of the kyngs ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gestye,
hys councell, and al his
Magistrates to se y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true boke
of God the holye Byble to be
tawghte and receyued of hys
magesties subiects, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ample
of Moses, Iosua, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
Iosaphat, Ezechias, and
Iosias, the Noble Princes of
goddes people. Ther was, and
is one doctryne more, in that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
Mariners dyd not onely praye
but also lightened the shyppe.
That thei praied and were not
heard, ye learne what a vanitie
it is, to praye after the opinion
of man. Nothynge at all it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayleth.
It neuer commeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, nor caseth the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of hym that prayeth. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they do not onelye praye
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:4404:35"/>
but also laboure: we se our due<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tye,
that as GOD freelye ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
healpe, so we muste tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
and do the beste we canne
wyth prayer, not onelye to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue,
and obtayne the free
helpe of God, but also to kepe
it. Thus I thought it good, to
speke before the seconde daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
which is thys. Ionas synne
is detected by lotts, so sayth the
texte.</p>
            <p>They sayde one to
the other: come let vs
caste lottes, that we
maye knowe, for whose
cause we are thus trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bled,
and so thei cast lot<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes,
and the lot fell vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
Ionas.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4404:36"/>
When they perceiued the
tempest ceassed not with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and deuocion euerye manne
vnto hys God, they vnderstod
that suche desperate daunger
could not come, but onely from
the Ire and displeasure of god
for some notable and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
cryme. And the more was
the feare because the crime was
not knowen, nor no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> woulde
be seene coulpable of it. They
thoughte it good therefore, to
serche the gyltye and offender
by lottes. And missed not of
theyr purpose adele, but found
Ionas the rebellion of God to
be the occacion of theyr troble.</p>
            <p>Of thys text we be learned
that the cause of all trouble in
publick and priuate persones
is syn, as we rede Deu. xxviii.
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:4404:36"/>

the Marinars. And in case we
be wyse, we wyll vnderstande
the same, and amend it, and not
to attribute our aduersities to

as fooles do.</p>
            <p>Of thys texte we learne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
howe so euer synne be
hyd for the tyme, yet at lengthe
it wyll be knowen, some by one
meanes, some by the other. By

In the primatiue and

            <p>Psal. l. How is it possible wher
euery sort offendeth in the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mune
wealth, but that the Ire
and vengaunce of God should
sende vnto our ship wyndes of
aduersitye. I knowe that Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:4404:40"/>
was neuer better knowen
to be the occasion of thys tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peste
in the sea, then I knowe
these foure sortes of people to
be the trouble, and wyll be the
dystruccion of thys commune
wealth if they be not found out
by lotte and wysdome be tyme.
But a man myghte aske what
should the kynges magestie do
in suche a case wyth all these
foure sortes of Ionasses? Let
hys maiestie learne of these ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riners,
then shall he do wel: and
as they dyd with Ionas, so the
kynges magestie must do with
these four sorts of people. What
they dyd, the Prophet shall tell
hys owne tale, and declare the
third daunger he fell into whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
is the examinacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Ionas
in thys forme.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4404:41"/>
Thei said vnto him:
shewe vs I praye the,
how thys trouble hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
vnto vs? What
is thyne occupacion?
whence commest thou?
what countrie man art
thou? Of what nacion
art thou?</p>
            <p>In these Ethnicall Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
we se a singuler discrecion
wit, &amp; humanitie. What if our
Mariners Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had suffe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
the lyke daunger and detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes sake with
in their shyppe, Doubtles they
would haue sworne, and out of
hande wythoute examinacion
haue cast him into the sea. But
these men be wyse that they do
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:4404:41"/>
not onelye serch to knowe his
faulte by lottes, but diligently
seketh to knowe all the circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stances
howe he fell into thys
daunger, lest Ionas should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
him selfe vniustlye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.
Ot thys doyng of the
Mariners we learne two thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
one humanitie towardes
the aflicted persons. The other
that all kynges and magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
oughte to condemne thys
lawe as a thynge pestiferous
and damned by gods lawes, to
execute sentence agaynste anye
man before his cause and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be heard, for it is contrarye
to the lawe of god, the lawe of
nature, and the law of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yea
God commaundeth that noma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4404:42"/>
Here is for the kynges ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestye
and hys cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel one more
doctrine to be learned of these
Mariners. I sayde that foure
sortes of people were the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the trouble of hys Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisties
shyppe thys Realme of
Englande, but I sayd not that
euerye man of these foure sorts
was giltye of the tempest, ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
there muste be lottes, and
examinacion of euerye deorce
and of eche person in hys de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
that the innocente be not
punyshed, neither the transgres<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>soure
fauored. And these muste
be examined by the mayster &amp;
hys shyppemen: that is, to oure
purpose, of the Kynges mage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stye
and hys Counsel. So that
in case the godlye wythout re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of persons, seeke to know
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:4404:42"/>
and vpon truthe, and knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
punyshe as they knowe,
the shyppe of thys commune
wealthe shall rest in peace
and quyetnes: if it be not
serched for, and amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the shyppe of
the commune
wealthe
shall
at laste be burste in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
whyche the

Amen.</p>

aunswere vpon hys exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacion,
because I knowe
thys sayinge to be trewe: obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium

That is, flatterye obtayneth

lest any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shuld for my truth

it were pleasure to me to speke
nothynge at al, in case the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
of my vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the daun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger
of these Ionasses, and the
saluacion of this ship of oure
commune wealthe forced me
not therunto. As touching myself
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:4404:52"/>
I am called vnto this place
to cry, in case I do not I know
all the bloud of these Ionasses
shalbe required at my hande:
which god forbyd. It were bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
I shuld cal so hard as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

               <p>The saluacion of these wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Ionasses moueth also to
speke in this matter &amp; with the

               <p>Farther the loue I beare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Kynges Maiestye and
to this comune wealth of Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land
<pb facs="tcp:4404:53"/>
compelleth me to speake,
seynge I se the angry hand of
God all redye streached forthe
to punysh vs, if we awake not
oute of synne. Laste of all be it
knowen to all menne that I
speake in the condemnacion of
the euyll, and commendacion
of the good. And that all men
may easlye find out and know
amonge these foure sortes of

of thys shyppe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune

gyue you one mooste true and
generall rule, whyche is thys.
Whoso euer, or of what so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
degre he be, that is or she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
hym selfe to be offended
wyth thys my free and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rente
speakynge of Goddes
worde, he or they be they what
<pb n="xliiii" facs="tcp:4404:53"/>
they be maye, arre the verye
Ionasses and troublers of
thys commune wealthe. And
these menne loue more darcke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lyght, moreto trouble
the shippe then to rest her. But
nowe to the texte wherein is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayned
Aonas aunswere vpon
hys examinacion.</p>
               <q>He aunswered them:
I am an Ebrew,
and feare the lord
God of heauen,
that made the sea
and the drie land.</q>
               <p>When as Ionas persea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
he coulde no longer clooke
<pb facs="tcp:4404:54"/>
and hyde hys offence, he dothe
not onelye confesse hys faulte,
but also maketh them priuye,
and vttereth hys fayeth and
religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath in GOD, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
theym. In that he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
hys faulte, we learne that
the fyrste gree and procedynge
to mercye and remyssion, is the
knowledge of the synne, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
is a thynge moste difficile
and harde to the fleshe to saye:
I haue offended the Lord, and
wil amend. For either we denie
oure syn with Cain, or extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
and excuse it wyth Saule.
Would to God our Ionasses
would acknowledge theyr fau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res,
&amp; not excuse it nor extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
it. It is but a mockeri once
in a yere to acknowledge, and
murmoure oure faultes in the
<pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:4404:54"/>
priestes eare. But we shoulde
from the harte repent the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectyng
of our bounden duties,
and vnfaynedlye amende it,
whyche is not onely paynefull
to the fleshe, but also gratefull
vnto God. I exhorte all men
therefore that knoweth theym
selues gyltye, as in deade
there is none of vs of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
innocente, we saye wythe
Dauyd: we haue offended the
Lorde.</p>
               <p>Yet is not thys inoughe to
confesse our faultes, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wythall
we muste make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of oure fayeth, but not
suche a confession as mooste
menne vse, but suche as maye
most be lyke vnto Ionasses.
And let theym imbrace onelye
Christe and hys doctrine, and
<pb facs="tcp:4404:55"/>
worship god in sprite &amp; veritye
as his word teacheth. This I
meane, let the preistes teache ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cordinge
to the worde of God,
the noble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gouerne and rule
thereby, the lawers conforme
theyr lawe to gods law, &amp; suche
lawes as be contrarie to gods
lawes abrogate and abolishe.
The people shoulde heare the
word of God, geue faithe vnto
it, and folow it. And so saye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man of vs with Ionas, I
am an Ebrew, that is to say, I
am a christian man, and wyll
frome henceforthe forsake my
synne, that disquieteth not only
myne owne conscience, but also
the hole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune wealth. It fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
how the mariners toke
Ionas answere.</p>
               <q>Then were the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:4404:55"/>
exceadyngelye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayde,
and sayed
vnto hym. Why
dydest thou so (for
thei knew that he
was fled from the
prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the lord
because he hadde
tolde them) &amp; said
more ouer vnto
him: what shal we
do vnto the, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the
sea may ceasse fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
trobling of vs: for
the sea wrought &amp;
was troblous.</q>
               <p>In these mariners we see
three thinges: feare, rebuke of
<pb facs="tcp:4404:56"/>
disobedience, and takynge of
councell howe to saue the ship.
This feare it is mooste like
sprange of this that the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
had hearde Ionas saye
howe he was commaunded by
God to preache vnto the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuites
theyr destruction, and
the cities also for theyr synne.
The mariners knowing them
selfes giltye of the same, them
selfes being both Idolaters, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fidels,
and of corrupt conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and lyuyng, fered the lyke pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
Who is it that will
not tremble at the angrie coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tenaunce
of gods dyspleasure?
But nowe a dayes oure stonye
and indurate hartes be paste
al feare, and turneth the threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenings
of God to a laughter,
sayinge in theyr hartes: ther is
no God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:4404:56"/>
That these gentilyshe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
rebuke Ionas of dyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
it declareth the faute
to be so greate when anye man
leueth his vocacion and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the vocacion of preching,
that it meriteth and is worthy
to be rebuked of all men. But
suche is nowe the proude min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of Byshops and pastours
that it wyl suffer no rebuke, or
Christian admonicion, but wil
be lauded and praised yea in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel
doyng and omissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their
vocacion, as it is to be seene in
that horrible and wycked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre:
Si papa. And not onelye,
the Pope but also euerye man
that slepeth, and delitethin his
sinne, refuseth all maner of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monicions.
If Ionas toke wel
at worthe the reprehension of
<pb facs="tcp:4404:57"/>
the heathen, it is more then ashame
one Christian to forsake
the admonicion of an other.</p>
               <p>In that they aske counsell
of Ionas, howe to saue the
shyppe, they declare a syngu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare
humanitye towardes a
straunger: that althoughe by
the meanes of hym they stode
in daunger bothe of lyfe and
goodes, yet woulde they leaue
no meanes they coulde, to saue
hym, thoughe it were wythe
theyr greate losse, and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>Thus we be bounde to do
as occacion shal serue: not cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly
wythout discression to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge,
but cheritabli with paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to beare with the weke, vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyll
suche tyme as the lawe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyreth
execucion of the euyll.
<pb n="xlviii" facs="tcp:4404:57"/>
Nowe foloweth the aunswere
of Ionas, wherwyth al he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth
him selfe as it is plaine
in the texte, and is the fourth
daunger he fel into.</p>
               <q>Take me and cast
me into the sea, so
shal it let you be in
rest, for I wote it
is for my sake that
this great tempest
is come vpon you.</q>
               <p>In thys answere we learne
and knowe what is the nature
and condicyon of euerye peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente
manne, to Iudge hym
selfe worthy payne and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshemente.
And that is so
trewe in case wee Iudge not
so of oure selues (and saye:
<pb facs="tcp:4404:58"/>
heretofore I was accompted
and toke my selfe for a christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
man, but in deade I was
the contrarye, wherefore I am
worthy of punyshmente) we be
but Hipocrites and dese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blers.
Thus shoulde the Nobleman
saye, the Lawer, the priest, and
the commune sorte of men as
Dauid techeth .ii. Sam. xxiiii.
When he sawe the commune

               <p>But O my gracious Lorde
and Kynge, suche penitent and

sorowful Ionasses be farre out
of youre realme, for none wyll
confesse theyr faultes. They
wyl rather saye: let the Bible in

and so shall folowe quietnes,
for it was neuer wel sithe prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching

It happened vnto the

               <p>Now foloweth the fift dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger

               <p>Generallye we learne that
there is no more pestiferous

<pb n="li" facs="tcp:4404:60"/>
declared here after. Nowe to
the text, whyche containeth the
prayer of the shypmen in thys
wyse.</p>
               <p>Wherfore thei cried
vnto the lord and sayd
O Lorde let vs not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe
for thys mannes
death, neither lay thou
innocent bloud to our
charge: for thou oh lord
hast done, euen as thy
pleasure was.</p>
               <p>Of thys oracion fyrste wee
learne that the Mariners were
conuerted vnto God by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chynge
of one Ionas. Before
eche man called vpon a su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drye

They excuse not theyr olde I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dololatrie
<pb facs="tcp:4404:61"/>
for their olde custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
sake, nor yet for the auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of their forefathers,
but symplie they imbrace the
trueth. The same shoulde we
followe, and for oure doctryne
it is written, as sayth Saynte
Paule in the fyftenth chapter
of hys Epystle to the Romay.
Whatsoeuer thyngs are wryt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten,
are wrytten for oure lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng:
that we through pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
and comforte of the scriptures
shoulde haue hope. Casting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
al Idololatrye &amp; false ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norynges
of God, we shoulde
in Chryst imbrase and receyue
the euerlastynge God and hys
infalliable worde, seynge wee
be not moued there vnto by
one Ionas but by manye: by
Kynge, by counsell, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
<pb n="lii" facs="tcp:4404:61"/>
other menne of God.</p>
               <p>The seconde thynge we
learne oute of thys prayer is
howe they desyre GOD, not
to Impute vnto theym the
deathe of, Ionas whyche had
not hurte theym but hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
in dysobeyinge the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
commaundemente: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we maye see howe the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
and Ethnyckes abhorred
murder, land Manslaughter,
and accompted it horrible and
a thynge damned by the lawe
of nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>They were in the sea, and
no manne coulde haue accused
them of murther, yet perceyued
they well that the eyes of God
coulde marcke theym where
so euer they were, and woulde
punyshe the facte. And wisely
<pb facs="tcp:4404:62"/>
they iudged: for so teacheth vs
all the Scripture of God as it
shall nowe apere: for I wyll
somewhat touch thys horrible
crime of murder more at large.
Murder is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitte two maner
of wayes, by chaunce and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norauntelye,
or of malice and
wetingelye. Ignoraunt when
agaynste hys wyll doynge
and meanynge nothynge lesse
then murder, agaynst hys wyll
killeth. Suche a murderer by
the lawe shuld not die, for God
absolueth and quitteth hym,
and prepared in the commune
wealthe of the Israelites, sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries,
and refuges for them,
whyther as they might flee for
their sauegarde. Exod. xxi. Nu.
xxxv. Ios. xx. lest theyr bloude
shulde be shed againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="liii" facs="tcp:4404:62"/>
He that of malice, and willing<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
killeth a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shuld no waies
be saued, for vnto such the lord
commaundeth deathe agayne.
Exo. xxi. Leui. xxiiii. And also
in the tyme of the lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
this was the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God for murder. Gen.
ix. he that sheddeth a mannes
bloude, shall haue his bloude
shed againe: and so saith Christ
Math. xxvi. he that striketh w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
the swearde, shall peryshe with
the sweard. This sin is so horri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble,
that no indulge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
shulde pitie the offence, nor par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>don
the fault: but the murderer
incase he fled to the highe aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he shoulde be fet fourthe:
as ye maye see the experyence
in Ioab at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement
of Salomon. iii. Regum. ii.
<pb facs="tcp:4404:63"/>
and reade. Nume. xxxv. If the
gistrate dyspense either for fere
of hym that shoulde suffer exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quution,
or for anye profit or
gayne, and punysh it not, what
both he other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prouoke the<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ire
of God agaynst hym selfe &amp;
the hole realme? For the Lorde
sayeth, he wyl not dwell in the
earth tyll it be pourged wyth
the bloude of hym that shed
the bloud. Nume. xxxv. Let all
men therefore in the commune
wealthe knowe and feare thys
doctrine of Paul. Ro. xiii. The
magistrat beareth not a sweed
in vayne. Let the Maiestrate
take hede of two things: first y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
vnder the pretexte and cloke of
the lawe to serue hys affecci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or gayne, he punyshe not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
innocent. In thys offended the
kyngs and magistrates of the
<pb n="liiii" facs="tcp:4404:63"/>
Israelites that for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce
of theyr supersticion,
false religion and corrupt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
kylled and put to deathe
the Prophetes, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
So Iesabell caused Na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>both
to be slayne. iii. Reg. xxi.</p>
               <p>The second let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> magestrate
take heade he absolue not him
that God condemneth, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth
to be punyshed, for

.iii. Regum. fourtene. Euen as
here is occacion to admonishe
of iustice towardes euil doers,
<pb facs="tcp:4404:64"/>
so is it to speake of warre, and
how it may be vsed lawfulli by
magestrates. The magestrate
offendeth when he beginneth
or continueth any iniuste bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
or of affeccion punisheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

iust execusion of iustice, not to

maye be seen that God wyl fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure
the magestrate that figh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth
against his owne brother,
if it be to amende vyce and to
kyll synne. For in manner the
hole tribe of Beniamin was de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stroyed
for the defence of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie.
Farther a maiestrate figh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth
iustly, when he resisteth vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iust

as shulde be kepte in the tyme
of warre it is written Deut. xx.
xxiii. Luke. iii. Oure warryers

The captayne by hys fayth is

that extreme pouertye

               <p>And as these vniuste and al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>readye

both of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune wealth and
the heades thereof.</p>
               <p>And well both Magistrate

And by false &amp; theuish meanes
bryngeth more to the war then
is hys owne: no maruell then
though God set such a thiefe o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer
hym as wyl geue hym lesse
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is his dew. True men were
wount to go to batel, and such
as prepared theim selues with
the feare of god to liue and die
for theyr Magistrate and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
nowe the veryer thiefe, and
blasphemoure of the God of
batel, the better soldiour. Wel
God maye gyue the vyctorye
to suche blasphemours for a
tyme, but doutles it wyll not
nor cannot continue. Loke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the warres that Moses
wrytteth of in hys fyue bokes,
and then shall ye knowe the
same. Wherefore I humbly re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quyre
all Magistrates bothe
<pb n="lvii" facs="tcp:4404:66"/>
in peace and warre to punyshe
chiefely these two vices adulte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rye
&amp; blasphemye, incase they
would haue either vyctorie in
war, or quietnes in peace.</p>
               <p>As touchyng swearyng and
blasphemye, it is knowen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
al men of God, how the law
condemneth it in the fyrste ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Exodi. xx. Deutronomi. v.
Thou shalt not take the name
of the Lord in vayne: for God
wyll not leaue vnpunyshed,
suche as abuse hys name. Of
an othe I thyncke it therefore
conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to speake sumwhat.
There is two maner of othes,
the one of custome or of sport,
the other serious and graue, re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quyred
and taken before the
Maiestrate or Iudge. The
Fyrst is deuyllyshe, damnable
<pb facs="tcp:4404:67"/>
and nought of euery part, and
forbidden by god to all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The other that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for the glorye of God, the
defence of the trueth, or helpe
of a mans neyghboure, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitye
shal require is laweful
and godly. But in this lawful
oth a man may offend two ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner
of wayes. Fyrst if hys hert
and mynde be not accordynge
to hys woordes, but that hys
mouth speaketh one thing and
the herte thyncketh an other
thynge: the seconde if he that
sweareth, sweare by anye crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Both these be blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
before God.</p>
               <p>And in case it be damnable
in a noughty matter to sweare
by creatures, is it not the same
trow ye, daylye and folyshly of
<pb n="lviii" facs="tcp:4404:67"/>
custome to sweare by a mans
hande, hys heade, by the masse,
and suche lyke? The more vile
the thynge is we sweare by, the
more is the othe detestable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God. Wherefore in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
not necessarye, and requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
lawfully, to sweare by anye
thyng, is synne. In wayghtye
matters to sweare by ani thing
except by god, is no lesse offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.
That may we see .iiii. maner of
wayes. By reason, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture,
exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, &amp; the Canon law.
By reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus: to sweare is to
protest &amp; promise the thing we
sweare to be true before hym y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
knoweth the thoughtes and
cogitacions of the harte, that
knoweth onlye and solye God:
therefore is it blasphemye to
sweare or attribute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same to a
<pb facs="tcp:4404:68"/>
creature as they do that swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by creatures.</p>
               <p>Agayne euery oth hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
wyth it, an inuocacion,
and execracion. An execraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he by whom we sweare
maye punyshe and curse vs
if we swere false. An inuocaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he by whom we swere,
woulde helpe vs if we sweare
true. But onely God can saue
and lose, reason woulde then
hym onely to be sworn by.</p>
               <p>The authoritye of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Thys also is double: the
one techeth by whom we shuld
swere, the other by whome wee
shoulde not sweare: that is by
God, &amp; by no creatures. Deut.
vi. x. Thou shalt feare the lord
thy God, and worshyp hym,
and also sweare by hys name.
<pb n="lix" facs="tcp:4404:68"/>
Esai. xlv. vnto me shall eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
kne bowe, and euery toung
sweare. In the .lxv. speakynge
of the callynge of the Gentiles
he sayeth: He that wyll sweare
shall sweare by the true God.
And Iere. xii. they shal sweare
the Lorde liueth.</p>
               <p>That no man should sweare
by creatures, ye haue. Exodi.
xxiii. Ye shall not thyncke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the name of straunge god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:
neyther shall it be hearde
out of youre mouthes. Iosue.
xxiii. The people be admonish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
not to sweare by the names
of the goddes that the people
vsed, whither thei were going.
Hierem. v. It is sayde that the
people offended because they
sweared by the gods that were
not God. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people thynke
<pb facs="tcp:4404:69"/>
it is no synne to annex a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with god, heare what So<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phonie
the prophet saith. Cap.
i. I wyll sayeth the Lorde, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroye
them that worshyp and
sweare by Malchon, that is to
saye by there patron. Where
as the Prophet meaneth, they
that sware by god &amp; creatures,
matcheth &amp; setteth God and the
deuyl in one chayre, &amp; sete. Exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ples
out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scriptures: Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
sware by the moste highe
god. God swereth by hym self.</p>
               <p>Policarpus woulde rather
suffer the flames of fyer, then
to sweare by Ceasars fortune.
Euseb, libro .iiii. Chap. xv.</p>
               <p>The Canon lawe Causa
.xxii. Q. i. clericum per creaturas. &amp;
Et si quis per creaturas, and si aliqua

               <p>
                  <pb n="lx" facs="tcp:4404:69"/>
Thus the lawes begynne, and
the glosse vpon the same pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
requyreth vs to sweare
onelye by god. I haue taried
the longer in thys matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I happened to se of late
a certaine boke for the making
of Deacons, priestes, and By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes,
wherein is requyred
an othe by Sainctes: where at
I did not a litle wonder. And
howe it is suffered, or who is
the authoure of that booke, I
well knowe not. I am led to
thynke it to be the faute of the
correctoure in the printynge,
for two causes. One is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in the othe for the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe
is no mencion made of
anye sainctes.</p>
               <p>The other cause is, that in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
same boke the minister muste
<pb facs="tcp:4404:70"/>
confesse at the receiuyng of his
vocacion, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the boke of God, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
holy scriptur to be perfet, &amp; suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficiente
for the saluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>Yet do I muche meruayle
that in the same booke it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
that he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wyl be admit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
to the ministery of goddes
word or hys sacramentes must
come in white vestime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
semeth to repugne playne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
wyth the former doctryne
that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sessed the onely word of
God to be sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And sure I
am they haue not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of
god, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thus a minister should
be apperelled, nor yet in the
primatiue and best church.</p>
               <p>It is rather the habit and
vesture of Aton and the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
then of the ministers of
Christe. Farther where and of
<pb n="lxi" facs="tcp:4404:70"/>
whome, and when haue they
learned, that he that is called
to the ministery of gods word,
shoulde houlde the bread and
chalice in one hande, and the
boke in the other hande? Why
do they not as well gyue hym
in hys hande the founte and
the water? For the one is a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramente
as well as the other.
If the founte be to great, take
hym a basynne wyth water or
such lyke vessell. But in thys
mater and in other, as tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thynges be to be borne w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
for the weakes sake awhyle, so
I thyncke it not mete before
the Kynges Maiestye and his
mooste honorable Councell to
halte in anye parte, but to saye
the truth: that they knowing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
same, may redresse it assone as
<pb facs="tcp:4404:71"/>
maye be, as my parte is &amp; al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
priuate persons to praye
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do the same, &amp; besech god
to restore vs to the primatiue
church, which neuer yet had nor
shal haue ani match or like. Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
all thynges beware of an
oth by any creatures, except ye
will be glad to haue gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
Now foloweth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sixt

               <p>So they toke Ionas &amp; cast
him into the sea, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sea left ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.
And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceadinglye,

               <p>Here se we two thynges: Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas
cast into the sea, and howe
the sea left there vpon hys ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynge.
Out of the fyrste lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
euery Magistrate &amp; king

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune wealth, as manye Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasses
as they fynde stoborne,
&amp; wyl not amende theyr lyues.
If Ionas in the sea could not
be saued, that offended but in
neglectyng of hys dewtie, and
yet confessed his faute, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mariners, what maye
wee thyncke: is it possible to

mani obstinate Ionasses: Nay

               <p>Fyrste Let vs speake of the
Byshops and priestes. Theyr
offyce was in the primatiue &amp;
fyrste churche, to be preachers
of goddes worde, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Christes Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.
Not to sacrifyce for ded

or anye souche lyke. Unto the

as they be called, of the holye
churche, be called: els by they
no shepherdes, but rauenynge
woulfes, to deuoure the shepe
of God. And that thys maye
the better be done youre ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
muste begyn wyth youre
Chapell and Chapellanes:
make theym to serue the same
soules that laboreth for theyr
<pb n="lxiii" facs="tcp:4404:72"/>
liuynges. If your Grace do it
not, ye shal put your own selfe
in daunger of God. And from
henceforth make your Chapel
laynes men of the churche, and
let the Chapell go. And when
your magesty hath done thys,
your selfe cause all noble men
of your realme to do the same.
The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reforme your Coleges in
the Uniuersities, and se honest
men to haue the leadynge and

seaithat is, put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of theyr

for the most part be veri much
nowe adayes combred wythal,
which wyll for pitye rather let
a fole or an euyl man to enioye
hys benefice, then a thousande
soules to be broughte to know
ledge? thys in no pitye but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a crueltye and kylling of

please the Magistrates to
make a law that no man shuld
haue Byshoprycke, benefyce,

               <p>The noble men that by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

These Gentlemen that lyueth
vpon dycynge, cardynge, ydle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
or with other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
muste be also admonysh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
yf they wyll not repente, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
caste them in to the

pitye hath brought both king
and the Lawes not onelye of
thys realme, but also of God
<pb facs="tcp:4404:74"/>
into contempte, and dayly wyl
more and more if it be not fore

and manye iudge it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

then to damne after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of God. For thei
saye: O he is a tall felowe, and
can do the kynge good seruice,
it were pitye he should be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
But in case they knewe or

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not
be perceyued where as the
payne for it is easy and lyght.
But the Lorde woulde vs the
better to iudge of the fault by
the greatnes of the payne, and
therefore the Lord is sayed to
explorate and trye hys in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliccion
as the golde is tryed
by the fyer. Farther his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye

               <p>Laste of all thys tyme of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas
beynge in the whales bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
was a type and fygute of
Christes beynge in the hearte
of the earth thre dayes &amp; three
mightes. Mat. xxii.</p>
               <p>Nowe foloweth it how thys
man behaued hym selfe in the
tyme of hys trouble. When he
perceyued in the fyshes belye
some hope and sparcle of lyfe,
he fell vnto prayer. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
prayer conteyneth in it
selfe two thynges, the knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the fault, and hope of
forgyuenes, I admonyshe all
the Ionasses of thys realme
that they acknowledge and
leaue of from their faults, and
beg pardone for them, excepte
<pb facs="tcp:4404:88"/>
they wyll dye eternallye. The
Byshoppes and the priestes
that hath either wyth false doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tryne
destroyed the churche, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by negligence not builded
it wyth the true worde of God,
lette them acknoweledge their
faultes, amende it, and aske re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
betyme if they wil not
dye in their synne. The noble
men and the Lawers that are
secretelye touched wyth the
worde of God, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
condempneth them of
wronges, fraudes, Iniuries,
and deceites lette them not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate
and harde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their hartes,
but praye to the Lorde to take
from them pryde, arrogancye
blindnesse, and couetousenesse,
lest they dye in theire synne, as
Saul did. The people let them
<pb n="lxxx" facs="tcp:4404:88"/>
pray vnto God for knowledge
and patience, that they maye
knowe and suffer all thynges
as true subiectes ought to do.
And that from hense forth they
hate discorde, dissencion, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
conspiracie, whoredom, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultery,
idlenes, hatred, enuye,
disdaine, and suche like as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh
goddes Ite, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to the destruccion of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
wealthe. But thys pray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er
of Ionas is so acceptable,
it myghte be thoughte of some
menne, that the place where
Ionas prayed in should haue
bettered it, as the folyshe opini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on
of the worlde is at thys
tyme: that iudgeth the prayer
sayed at the hyghe aulter to
be better then that whyche is
sayed in the Quier, that in the
<pb facs="tcp:4404:89"/>
quere better then it that is sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the bodye of the churche:
that in the body of the churche
better then the prayer sayd in
the fyelde, or in a mans cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
But oure Prophet sayth:
the lord hath no respect to the
place, but vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heart &amp; faith
of hym that prayeth: and that
apereth: for penitente Ionas
praieth out of the whales vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

<pb n="lxxxi" facs="tcp:4404:89"/>
the prayer made to God in the

that the magistrates shoulde

thys were done, it shoulde not

but also cause y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> people the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <p>The thyrde thynge in thys

And the Lorde is angry wyth

Chap. ix. because they turned
not vnto hym that strake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
nor vnto the God of armoure.
And in the Prophet Ose. Chap
vii. They called not to me (say<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth

And in the same place a litle af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
sayeth the Prophet: they be
retourned, but not vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> high<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>est.
So lykewyse are they no
lesse to be blamed that deuyde
their hartes parte vnto God,
and parte vnto creatures: of
whome speaketh Osee, in the

But it is al to the contrary: we
knowe not what prayer is, nor
yet wyl take the paynes to lern
it, The more is the petye, and
the more is God stirred to ven<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geaunce
and punishement, and
the more cruell shal the payne
be when it is executed by God.
As we knowe by the texte, he
prayed, so may we know by the
same how he prayed, and what
was the forme and manner of
hys prayer. That is verye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to be knowen, marked
and borne awaye. The effecte
and su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me thereof consysteth in
thre poyntes. In two of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> first
verses he putteth forthe bryef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the abridgement &amp; Epitome
of hys prayer. Then declareth
he the greatenes of his dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger
<pb facs="tcp:4404:92"/>
and ieopardy. Thyrdly he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

               <p>☞Out of thys fyrst parte we
learne two doctrines: the one
that we shuld not dispaire, nor
cleane caste of God in aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
The other, that in aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
we shulde not flye, nor seeke
any forbydden, or vnlawefull
meanes of help. And these two
thynges obserued Ionas in
this his trouble: and we shuld
do the same, accordynge to the
commaundemente of God.</p>

to hys promises.
Whereof all Idololatricall
Byshoppes and priestes may
learne, if they wil forsake their
Idololatrye, and call vnto the
Lord, mercy is ready for them.
And if the lasciuious, auarici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

               <p>The second part of his pray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4404:94"/>
The one, because wyth the

For the more a man feleth hys

according to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> minde

doth not only afflicte the pore

nowe into my mynd a practise
of euyl takyng the gouerners
worde &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, how
perilous, &amp; daungerous thing
it is. I was once in the rase of
Britaine wyth a fore wynde,
and contrarye fludde, the seas
in that place goynge both ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe,
and that by reason of a
<pb n="xci" facs="tcp:4404:99"/>
multitude of Rockes in the
same place. The master of the
shyppe to conduite her the bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter,
sate vpon the mayne yerde
to see the seas aforehande, and
cryed to hym that styrred the

syde he shuld styrre the shippe,
to breake best the daunger of
the sea. The wynde blowynge

mystoke it, and styrred a

of the masters lawe, had
almoste cast vs vnder the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Then thought I, it is not
wythoute cause that wysemen
compare a common wealthe to

               <p>For incase the masters officer
<pb facs="tcp:4404:100"/>

the shyp wyll of force drowne.
So shal thys co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men wealth, &amp;

Therefore praye to hym that

               <p>There is one worde more in

he shall se againe the holy
temple of the Lorde. In the
whiche wordes, note two thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
The one, howe that in
the mooste obscure and darke
<pb n="xcii" facs="tcp:4404:101"/>
troubles of aduersity, God
suffereth some sparke of conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacion
to shyne.</p>
               <p>The other, to what ende a
manne beyng in trouble, shuld
desyre to bee deliuered: to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolle,
and prayse for euer the
name of the Lorde, Esay thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye
and eyght. But how thys
ende of deliueraunce is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in oure dayes, the Lorde
knoweth. We vse not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the Lord to be deliuered to
gloryfye and laude his holye
name as thys Ionas dyd, and
Dauyd Psal. fyftye and one,
an hundred &amp; .xviii. But from
sickenesse and aduersytye we
tourne oure selfe to al vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes,
and lyberty of lyfe. And
wher we wer euel before trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and sicknes, we be worse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb facs="tcp:4404:102"/>
Therfore when God hath
wasted one rod vpon vs in pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyshemente,
he begynneth to
make another more sharper
then the fyrste. And euen as
the fall agayne into a disease,
before the fyrste be quite paste

more daunger vnto the paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente:
euen so the relapse, and
fall agayne into the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

not onlye doubleth the griefe
and payne of the punishment,
but also endaungereth the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted

But aske y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> true iudge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word

But I wil do the sacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fice

we do, and not vse healthe and

Ionas also amendeth the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish

For onlye Chryste is the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyce

               <p>As thoughe he hadde sayd:

man can geue health of bodye

The thyrd doctryne of this
fyrst part declared for asmuche
as it behoueth euery man, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde
idlenes in his vocation,
It myght be demaunded what
shuld a man do to satysfye hys
vocation. It is tolde Ionas
in thys place. Preache sayeth
the text. He saieth not: take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gimente
and gouernaunce of
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune wealth, but preach.
Of these wordes we learn that
euerye man is bounde to do the
workes of the vocation he bea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth
the name of: and not to me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dle
with other mens laboures.
It is not the offyce of the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe
to playe the kinge and
Lorde, nor the kinges parte to
playe the Byshoppe. For the
kynges offyce is inoughe for a
kynge, and the Bishoppes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb facs="tcp:4404:114"/>
inoughe for a Byshop, let
them do the best they can, and
studye eche of them in their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
But let the kynge take
hede he be able to iudge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Byshop do true ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
to God in his vocacion bi
the worde of God, and let the
Byshop do the same, take hede
whether the kynge or councell
wolde commaunde hym to do
anye thynge contrarye to the
workes of his vocacion, which
is to preache gods worde: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case
he do, wyth knowledge
and sobernes to admonyshe
hym, and to brynge hym to a
better mynde. If y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> be a iudge,
remember thi name, and do the
workes of ryght iudgemente.
If a iustice, do accordinge to
thy name: if a marchaunt, bye
<pb n="cvi" facs="tcp:4404:114"/>
and sell truelye: if anye other
subiecte, doo accordinge to
the name thou bearest, as oure
subiectes of Englande of late
dyd neuer awhyt. For master
person, &amp; an olde wyfe taughte
them to forget the dueties of
true and godly subiectes, and
wolde haue made them all kin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges,
but the Lorde cast them in
to the sea. Thys duety of eche
man is handsomly set forth by
terteyne pictures in the towne
house at Basyll in thys verse.
<q>In supplex ora, tu regna, tuque labora</q>
There be thre images, the one
of the Pope, the other of the
Emperoure, the thyrde of a
plough manne, and the verse
teacheth all thre their dueties.
<pb facs="tcp:4404:115"/>
He biddeth the Pope pray, the
Emperoure to raygne, and the
plougheman to laboure. Let
therfore al Byshops &amp; priestes
knowe their office is to preach
&amp; pray. This I saye, God to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>corde,
of no hatred but of loue,
for I am afraied of gods thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teninges
&amp; ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geaunce toward
them, if they amende not. For
God sayeth he wyl requyre the
bloude of the people at the By<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shoppes
hande. Eze. iii.xxxiii.
And Paule sayeth: wo be vnto
me if I preach not .i. Cor. ix.</p>
               <p>Here myghte the Bishoppe
or the person paraduenture
partlye excuse them selfes and
saye: I knowe my faulte, and
wolde gladlye amende it if I
coulde, but I am so olde I can
not preache, nor neuer vsed mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="cvii" facs="tcp:4404:115"/>
there vnto. I wold aduise
hym then to folow the doinges
of Ualerius the Byshoppe of
Hipponensis, that in hys olde
and latter dayes perceiuinge
hys age coulde not satysfye
the laboures dewe vnto hys
vocation, associated to hymself
a coumpanion and coadiutor
Saint Augustine, as he testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
Epist. cxlviii. In the be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gynninge
of that Epistle thus
he wryteth. Before al thynges
I wold your godlye prudence
shulde thinke in this our tyme
nothing to be more acceptable,
facile, or more desired of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the office of a Bishop, priest, or
deco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if their office be slightly &amp;
sle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derly vsed, but with God no
thynge is more dampnable, mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>serable,
or sorowful. The same
<pb facs="tcp:4404:116"/>
knewe Samuel: for in his age
he instituted his so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes to help
and ease the intollerancye and
importaunce of hys offyce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> so
I woulde euerye Byshop and
personne that for age or lacke
of learnyng cannot do hys of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyce,
should institute and take
vnto hym some wyse and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
preacher to helpe him, and
not a synger as nowe is vsed.
If this counsel and doinges
of the godlye men rehersed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
lyke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deuise
some other lyke, and all is one
to me, so they exchue the Ire
of God. For doutles it is hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
to fall in this parte, into
the handes of God. For what
shal it auayle them to wynne
al the world, and lose their own
soules? I wold lykewyse praye
<pb n="cviii" facs="tcp:4404:116"/>
&amp; admonysh the Magistrates
to se the scholes better maintay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned:
for the lacke of them shall
bring blindnes into this church
of Englande againe. And such
as be the patro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es and geuers
of benefyces, lette them take
hede they gyue and bestowe
them vpon worthie menne, and
sel them not to Asses and blind
blocke headed felowes: For if
they bestowe theire benefices
for lucre or affeccyon, to suche
as can not or wil not fede with
the worde of God, the people
of hys cure, the patrone shall
dye eternallye for it as well
as hys blynde and naughtye
curate, person, or vicar. The
forth doctrine of this first part
is very necessary: for when the
<pb facs="tcp:4404:117"/>
Bishoppes and priestes heare
theyr offyce is to preache, then
thinke thei: but what we prech
it is no matter: it lyeth in oure
arbitrement &amp; pleasure. Naye
sayeth the texte. Preache that
I byd the: and so sayth Saint
Peter .i Pet. iiii. Math. xxviii.</p>
               <p>In thys vocation of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge,
the preacher should so
vse hym selfe as he myght saye
all wayes: my doctrine is not
my doctryne, but hys that
hathe sende me. For it is
goddes woorde and his lawe
that turneth the hartes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to repentaunce. Psal. xix.
cxix. For the word of God writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten
is as perfect as God hym
selfe: and is in deade hable to
make a man perfecte in al thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
.ii. Timo. iii. Wherefore it
<pb n="cix" facs="tcp:4404:117"/>
needeth not that blasphemous
and stinkinge helpe of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe
of Rome, that durst say
the law of God is not of it self,
but by his interpretacion, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But by this
meanes he gote authoritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the scripture to bury it, and
to stablyshe what he woulde
were it neuer so deuilishe, and
heretical. Therfore let suche
as be of God do as they haue
in commission from hym, and
not as they please them selfes:
for if they do, they be of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
and not of Chryste.</p>

The euyll wyth affliction be

Gen. x. They that heard hym,

The lyke hath not bene seene.
<pb n="cli" facs="tcp:4404:160"/>
For it is easier for a Cooke to
please an hundreth mouthes,
wyth one mete, then a preacher
to order one sermon or oracion
to please ten heades. It were
well in our tyme if at euery ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon
were one of the magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes

and at ten Sermones one

               <p>Wherefore we learne how
<pb facs="tcp:4404:162"/>
much the truth is wurthye to
be estemed, seyng that a kynge
vpon the brute thereof made

resisted not (as now we se ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

.iiii. Reg. xxii. So dyd Dauid
and Iosaphat heare &amp; graunt
to the admonicions of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes.
All kynges therefore
and magistrates shuld harken
vnto the truthe, and learne it

and knowledge of gods lawe

<pb n="cliii" facs="tcp:4404:162"/>
that it appertayneth nothinge
to theyr office to study and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

the iudgement and study ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to be committed vnto them:
and so by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same meanes they
perswade &amp; cause prynces ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times to persecute the truth
and veritie by ignoraunce, as
the kynges of Israel dyd that

Prophetes.</p>
               <p>But most gracious kyng,
and ye my lordes of hys most

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4404:163"/>
And most gracious kynge
take ye hede that the vertues
ye learn and be brought vp in
in youth, ye practyse &amp; exercise
them in age. And incase your
Magesty wil so do, beware of
one thing: y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> poison of flaterie.
The whyche youre Magestye
may vse as a good medycine,
and not a poiso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if ye take hede

grace thynk your selfe to be at

youre hyghnes in hand to be.
It shall be a medicine, yf your
Magestye studye to be the

               <p>Youre Magestye may see
an Example hereof in kynge
Iehoas, that in hys youthe
fauoured, and sette forthe the

he fell from it, by the meanes
of flatteroures that decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
hym.</p>
               <p>But youre Magestye shall
do best to folowe thys Godly
Kynge of the Niniuites, and
embrace contynually the word
of the lyuynge God. And thus
shal youre grace be the better
able to doo, incase youre high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

euerye Sundaye one sermon,
whych shoulde brynge muche

Of thys we learne that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayth

The rych, the poore, the kyng,

               <p>As for this external doing
on of sackeclothe, it was the
maner at that tyme so to doo,
and declared theyr repentau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
and amendemente: And so I
woulde it were nowe. He that
<pb n="clv" facs="tcp:4404:164"/>

remoue the pryde thereof and
goo soberlye: he that in meate,
would vse more sobryetie, Yet

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion
in the meate: but the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse

As for the vestimentes of the

In y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thyrd place Ionas put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
an excellent discripcion of
God, the whych we should wel
kepe in mynde: that he is a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
and mercyful God, longe
suffering and of much clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
Thys descripcion of God

<pb facs="tcp:4404:179"/>
the whych encoraged Iustes &amp;
shulde do the same to vs if we

was the synne of Ionas, that
toke an occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be angry by
gods fauour and goodnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
thys sorowful Citye.
Euen thus dyd the Pharises,

he kept companye wyth

reioyceth very much. But the

among writers, but it maketh
no matter therof, it is ynough
we knowe it was a tree wyth

would succour both the bodye

it beareth therein the y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
and propertie of suche
honours, riches, and treasures
as be in thys world: whych so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly

Noman therfore shuld

                  <p>And by the withering away
of this lytle tree, God woulde

of so greate a Citye?
For the tree sprang vp in one
nyght, and the Citie had stand
many hundred yeares. Againe
for the tree, Ionas laboured
neuer a dele, but God buylded
Niniue. The tree is but one
thynge, the Citie had greate
nombre both of men and catel.
And least Ionas myght haue
sayd: yea, but al men of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
be euyl, therfore worthy to

the Lord shal aske what

repent ye, and spend the giftes

all peryshe, Luke. xiii. God

And now the lord hath

geuen you peace, because ye
myght haue leasure to do these
thyngs, as Paul saith .i. Tim.
ii. Do therfore as Salomon
did .iii. Re. viii. Abuse not the
peace in playing sportes, and
pastyme, but in the buildynge
of Gods temple, whych hath a
longe tyme layne desolate: Ye
haue an example. Num. v, and
in any case let that example be
folowed. Ther be the gestes of
Iosaphat the kynge wrytten
ii. Para. xvii. in the whych are
thre notable thynges. Fyrst he
toke away and remoued from
hys people, Idololatrie.</p>
                  <p>The seconde, he gaue them
true iudges, whose godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicions

booke. cap. xix. that feared the
Lorde, accepted in iudgement

no perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, third. They receiued
no brybes, nor rewardes.</p>
                  <p>The thyrde he placed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
Priestes not in one
place but in all the Cytyes of
Iuda: and not to the ende they
shoulde playe and pastyme,
but to teache, and not euerye
thynge, but the lawe of God.
Al these thynges muste ye do,
mooste Gracious Kynge and
you my honourable Lordes
of hys highe and wysecouncel,
if ye wyll lyue in peace, and
quyetnes. I do not exhorte

                  <p>And this your magesty shal

<pb n="clxxxiii" facs="tcp:4404:192"/>

iiii. Reg. xii. so the same yuell

please you to commaund more

before your magestie, it wyll
not be a lytle healpe to you yf
they be wel made, wel borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye,

seyng ther is in the yeare .viii.
M.vii.C.lx. houres, it shall
not be much for your highnes
no nor for al your housholde,
to bestow of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> .lii. in the yere

If your magesty do these thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges,
the blud of youre people
