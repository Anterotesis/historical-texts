            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THese Papers, (the Effect of some leisure Hours in the Country) had never seen the Light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wrote only for my own Private Diversion; if by a most unexpected Accident, a fair Written Copy of it had not come to my hands, desiring my strict Examination of it, in order to its being Publisht. I confess I was as much surpriz'd to see it, as Mr. <hi>Dryden's Sofia</hi> in <hi>Amphitrion</hi> was to view <hi>Mercury</hi> in his own Shape: I knew I had the Original in my Closet, and wondred to find one so nearly like it in Manuscript.</p>
            <p>I was often, I must confess, Importun'd for a Copy, but deny'd it to the Dearest of my Friends; those few who read it, Protested by all that was Sacred, not to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe a Line of it: But it seems some very civil Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to me unknown, (finding a Salvo for his Promise) Copied it, and sent it to a Book-seller, (pretending he found it on the Road) desiring, if he thought it would turn
<pb facs="tcp:102082:3"/>
to Account, to Print it: He, as Interest Governs the World, resolv'd to send it to the Press. This coming to my Knowledg, I was absolutely necessitated to Print it in my own Defence; and as it is, 'tis all at the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Service. Perhaps some Angry SHE may be Offended with some biting Lines; but let her Fret on, 'tis the same thing to me, for of all the Misfortunes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to Flesh and Blood, Heaven Deliver me from Love and Dotage.</p>

               <l>HAppy was Man at first by Nature made,</l>
               <l>The welcome guest of <hi>Edens</hi> blisful shade;</l>
               <l>With awful Reverence every where Ador'd,</l>

               <l>Ev'n the wild Beasts, who have been Rebels since,</l>
               <l>Then practis'd <hi>Non-Resistance</hi> to their Prince.</l>
               <l>When for his pleasure he disposed to rest,</l>
               <l>No sawcy Insect durst his sleep molest;</l>
               <l>In gentle slumbers undisturb'd he lay</l>

Lord of himself, his passions not enslav'd;</l>
               <l>He nothing wanted, for he never crav'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>It hapned on a too too fatal time,</l>
               <l>As he did up a Spacious Mountain climb</l>
               <l>Of Natures works, a prospect to survey,</l>
               <l>A lovely Grove invited him to stay;</l>
               <l>Where spreading <hi>Beach</hi> and stately <hi>Elm</hi> afford</l>
               <l>A pleasing shade to the <hi>Creation's Lord</hi>:</l>
               <l>Hard by, a murm'ring Stream did softly creep,</l>
               <l>On whose green Banks he laid him down to sleep:</l>
               <l>But whilst in pleasant Dreams intrans'd he lay,</l>
               <l>Some Spirit came and stole his Rib away,</l>
               <l>And of that <hi>crooked shapeless</hi> thing did frame</l>
               <l>The <hi>Worlds great Plague,</hi> and did it Woman name.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He 'wak'd, with Wonder and Devotion fill'd,</l>
               <l>When he her goodly Shape and Form beheld:</l>
               <l>With gazing his amazement was increast,</l>
               <l>He thought she was some <hi>Goddess</hi> at the least:</l>
               <l>But when the thing was better understood,</l>
               <l>He found she was but only <hi>Flesh and Blood.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Without <hi>Priests Aid</hi> he took her for his Bride,</l>
               <l>And laid the <hi>smiling Mischief</hi> by his side.</l>

Love's solemn Rights not long had been fulfil'd,</l>
               <l>But his new Spouse perceiv'd she was with Child;</l>

               <l>The fatal morfel hardly swallow'd down,</l>
               <l>She found the angry Face of Heav'n to Frown;</l>
               <l>Yet so prevailing was her Malice grown,</l>
