         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thoſe Divines therefore who quarrell and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo much for the Faith and Religion, they may talke what they liſt, but hee that love's not both Trueth and Peace, love's indeed neither, nor hath he any true affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or deſire to either of them, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire's them not both. For if it be true which Philoſophers tell us, that each na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body doth no leſſe deſire it's unitie than it's being, I ſee no reaſon why the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and myſticall body, the Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, ſhould not with as great a zeale ſtudy to preſerve her unitie: ſeeing if that be once diſſolved and loſt, ſhee is ſo farre from being a Church, that ſhe cannot ſo much as be imagined one. Let us then on God's name be as earneſt and eager in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring &amp; defending the Trueth as the beſt, but withall let us not forget that of <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> that <hi>if it be poſsible, and as much as in</hi>

               <hi>us lie's, we live peaceably with all men:</hi> J ſay, with all men, in an externall and civill; but with all Chriſtian men, in a ſpirituall and Eccleſiaſticall peace. This is the earneſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32736:5"/>
deſire of our Saviour Chriſt, and 'tis the joynt wiſh &amp; prayer of his whol Church, that all they who profeſſe themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leivers in Chriſt, might be <hi>united and knit</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 17. 21. Act. 4. 32.</note> 
               <hi>together into one body; that they might be all of one heart and of one ſoule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being ſo, ſurely thoſe pious and peacemaking Divines are highly to bee commended, who of late have imployed themſelves and their endeavours about the reeonciling of the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. For my owne part, I would to God I were able to contribute any thing that might further and promote ſo good and godly a worke. What I can, I ſhall willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at your requeſt (Sir) doe it: and ſhall impart unto you what my thoughts were, when J lately meditated with my ſelfe hereupon.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place therefore, it would bee conſidered, whether or no it be poſſible to eſtabliſh ſuch an union amongſt all the Reformed Churches, ſo as that they ſhall account of one another not as friends on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but as Brethren; and exhibit mutually
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32736:6"/>
each to other the ſignes, fruites, and effects not onely of an outward and generall freindſhip, but of a more intimate &amp; ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall amity and communion. For if this fraternall &amp; ſpirituall union we ſo much deſire, cannot be had, we may then deſiſt; things impoſsible doe not binde us to the having or ſeeking of them: but if it may poſsibly be procured, 'twere a great pitty and a ſhame that ſo good a worke and ſo well-pleaſing to God as this is, ſhould be either oppoſed or delayed.</p>
            <p>Now when I ſay, that it would firſt be conſidered whether or no this Union we treate of, be poſsible; my meaning is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no ſuch an Union may ſtand with a diverſity of Opinions amongſt private Doctors in theſe ſeverall Churches, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching thoſe much-controverted points which have of a long time (to the great greife of all good men) much troubled the <hi>Germane</hi> Churches. For although it were to be wiſhed, that Divines would fairely and fully agree amongſt themſelves about all thoſe Controverſies; yet for ſo many
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32736:6"/>
different mindes to concurre all in the ſame Opinion, is (as I conceave) a thing ſcarce to be hoped for, much leſſe to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in one age. But that theſe ſaid Churches, notwithſtanding ſuch diſputes as hang undecided, may nevertheleſſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine amongſt themſelves a Chriſtian Charitie and correſpondence, is apparent from hence, that as often as Divines of both ſides have ſet themſelves ſeriouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this work, they ſtill prevailed in it as much as they deſired; and they might no doubt have prevailed further, if they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had not wilfully ſtood in their own way.</p>

But here if any one think, that this was no ſuch entire and perfect Union as that which now I affirm to be poſsible; I will grant him this: but then I muſt adde withall, that it was not any impoſsibility in the thing it ſelfe, but rather the wilfull oppoſition of ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, poſſeſt with ſome jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and ſuſpitions, which was the cauſe why that godly and good worke was not brought to full perfection.

               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and ſome other eminent Divines of the ſame opinion with him, they did not only ſue for an abſolute and perfect agreement, but beſides they offered to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that it was very fit ſuch an Union ſhould be concluded; neither did they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any thing that might make for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:32736:7"/>Moreover, that this Union of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches we ſpeake of, is not a thing impoſsible, is confirmed further from that agreement amongſt the <hi>Poloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>

               <hi>yee Worthies, and be doing, and the Lord will be with you.</hi> Never deſpaire but that may be now effected, which all men will grant hath been done heretofore.</p>
            <p>But leaſt this groundleſſe bugbeare of a fancied impoſsibility ſhould yet ſlacken the endeavours either of Princes, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, or any other pious and well affected Chriſtians, and deterre them from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding herein; I will recount all thoſe lets and hinderances, which render the peace and union of Churches utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible to be obtained: from whence it will eaſily appeare, that there's no one of them here, to hinder why the <hi>Germane</hi> Churches (notwithſtanding ſome points of difference amongſt them) may not ſetle a firme peace amongſt themſelves, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once ſetled preſerve it inviolable.</p>
            <p>Now the firſt and maine Obſtacle that hinders thoſe Churches which agree not in all points of Religion, from entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Communion amongſt themſelves, is the uſurping and exerciſing of a tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32736:8"/>
power and authority one over ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther. For if any one Church will take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her to domineer and lord it over the faith of other Churches, ſo as not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any for her brethren, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any into her fellowſhip and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, but ſuch onely as will be content to beleive and ſpeak juſt as ſhee will have them, all hope is then taken away of ever obtaining or preſerving any agreement in any differences or diſputes whatſoever. For the ſacred Scriptures forbid us thus to enſlave our ſelves to any humane authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and our ſole Lord and Maſter Chriſt Jeſus forbid's us to acknowledge any up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth for a Lord over our Faith and<note place="margin">Mat 23.</note> Conſcience: and that Church which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's into a Communion with another up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe termes, doth not hereby purchaſe a Peace, but rather reſigne's up her ſelfe to a moſt unjuſt ſlavery. Onely the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is come to that height of pride &amp; madneſſe, that ſhe will take upon her to exclude from the communion of Saints, &amp; damne to the pit of Hell all ſuch Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32736:9"/>
as will not ſubmit their necks to that Antichriſtian yoake of abſolute and blind obedience. God of his goodnes ever keep off this Popiſh folly and fury from ſetting foot in the Proteſtant Churches: which if it ſhould once take place, that union of our Churches which we are all bound to pray for, would bee no longer either to be hoped or wiſht for. But (bleſſed be God for it) it is well known, there's not any of the Reformed Churches but doe from their ſoules deteſt and abhorre all ſuch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian ambition and deſire of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignety. And thus have I removed out of the way the maine Obſtacle which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally occaſion's a perpetuall diviſion &amp; rent betwixt ſuch Churches as differ in ſome points, and thereby make's an union of thoſe Churches to become impoſſible.</p>
            <p>A ſecond let or hinderance which may render the ſaid union of different Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (for example, the <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Helvetian</hi> Churches) impoſsible, is the approbation and practice of Jdolatry in the one, &amp; the utter deteſtation of it in the other. That of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32736:9"/>
the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> is well knowne, <hi>though</hi>
               <note place="margin">C. 4. v. 5.</note> Iſrael <hi>play the harlot, yet let not</hi> Judah <hi>offend: come yee not unto</hi> Gilgal, <hi>neither goe yee up to</hi> Beth-aven. Likewiſe alſo that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>what agreement hath the Temple of God</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 16.</note> 
               <hi>with Idols?</hi> And a number of places more to the ſame purpoſe. Neither is that ſaying of <hi>Tertullian</hi> touching this matter unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy our obſervation, <hi>Idolatry</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is become the grand and generall ſin of whole mankinde, the Epidemicall diſeaſe of the whole world.</hi> Since therefore God ſo ſeverely chargeth us <hi>to keepe our ſelves from Idols</hi> &amp; all kinde of Idolatry, though never ſo ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly colour'd over, wee may well call that morally impoſsible which cannot be performed without ſome ſtaine and tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Idolatry, and without a high and hainous offence againſt the ſacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of God.</p>
            <p>Here then we may behold that grand let, whereby the Reformed Churches (to their great greife of heart) are forced to ſhunne a Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For ſo farre in love is ſhee with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32736:10"/>
her Idolls, and ſo rigorouſly doth ſhee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the worſhipping of them upon all her children, that no man can be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into her Communion, at leaſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in it, unleſſe he will become a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and down-right Idolater. If the caſe ſo ſtood, that the <hi>Germane</hi> Churches could not enter into and enjoy a bleſſed Unity and Peace one with another, except they muſt be required and bound either to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe an Idolatrous worſhip, or at the leaſt to beleive and profeſſe that ſuch practice is not unlawfull, I would not ſtick to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that a Communion which cannot be had but upon ſuch hard conditions, is indeed impoſsible to bee had: ſince (as Lawyers uſe to ſpeake) <hi>wee can doe onely ſo much, as may lawfully be done by us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here we have juſt cauſe to bleſſe God, that the Reformed Churches (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have not the happineſſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in all matters of leſſer moment) yet doe they all of them by his grace unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly conſpire &amp; joyne together againſt Idolatry; ſo as not onely to condemne, but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32736:10"/>
alſo to beat downe and aboliſh it: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that if at this very houre they were all diſpoſed and deſirous to joyne hands and ſtrike a league of amity and union, it might be done without any the leaſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Idolatry. Away then with that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended impoſsibility of a Reconciliation, grounded upon the perill of Idolatry: nor let any ſuch falſe ſurmiſes weaken the heart or hands of any religious Chriſtian from going on with ſo good a worke.</p>
            <p>The third &amp; laſt Obſtacle which doth block up the way to an union &amp; render's it impoſsible, is the differing of ſeverall Churches about ſome fundamental point of Faith, neceſſary to be knowne and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived by every chriſtian upon paine &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of eternall damnation; ſo as that the one ſide doth ſolidly hold and maintaine it, the other heretically denie's and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe's it. For to be at peace with Heretickes who goe about to undermine and ſubvert the foundation of our Chriſtian faith, what is it elſe but to revolt from Chriſt the rocke on which the Church is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32736:11"/>
&amp; built? Of this laſt Obſtacle, becauſe it is of ſpeciall uſe and moment, I ſhall treate ſomewhat more at large.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place therefore, I conceive that to be a Fundamentall point, which (by the ordination of God revealing ſuch a truth) is of ſuch neceſsity unto ſalvation to be knowne and aſſented unto, as that a bare Ignorance, much more a wilfull Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of it carries with it a certaine pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of excluſion from the kingdome of heaven. Divines now-adaies have no Commiſsion to invent or coine any new Articles of this nature, and obtrude them on Gods Church: that which was not fundamentall in the Apoſtolicall and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, all our aſſertions and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Anathema's will never bee able to make it ſuch.</p>
            <p>Theſe firſt and fundamentall Trueths, collected out of the whole body of the Scriptures &amp; put together in the Apoſtles Creed, make up that Rule of Faith which <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> terme's <hi>puſillis magniſ<expan>

            <p>He that beleive's all which wee have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:32736:12"/>
here compriſed in this ſhort Creed, and endeavour's to lead his life according to the Commandements and Precepts of our Saviour Chriſt, cannot juſtly be denied the title of a Chriſtian, nor expelled the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and communion of any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church whatſoever. On the other ſide, He that ſhall deny or oppoſe any one of the ſaid Articles, although he arrogate to himſelfe the name of a Chriſtian, yet is he to be excluded and baniſhed the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all orthodoxe and ſound Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, there are (I confeſſe) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Trueths contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and deducible from thence by good and ſolid conſequence, which are very profitable to be knowne, and of ſingular uſe to further us in the knowledge of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity: but they are then only (and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe) neceſſary to be beleived under paine of forfeiture of our ſalvation or communion with the Church, when 'tis clearely evidenced unto us that they are contained in Gods word, or may neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be inferred from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:32736:12"/>In theſe points therefore, if any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church cannot make the Trueth which ſhe her ſelfe beleive's, ſo cleare and manifeſt to other Churches, as thereby to winne them over to the ſame beleife, ſhee muſt forſake them in their Errours, but by no meanes may ſhe (becauſe of ſuch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours) deny them her charity and Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>munion. I adde further, that if it ſhould happen that two Churches ſhould vary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſome particular place of holy Writ, the one conceiving that it confirme's a fundamentall point of Faith, and the other thinking that it doth not ſo: yet is not ſuch a difference as this a ſufficient cauſe why they ſhould fall at odds, and ſeparate one from another; ſo long as they agree both of them in the Point it ſelfe, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it to have cleare &amp; ſolid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in other places of God's word. And laſt of all this may be added yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that 'tis not a thing impoſsible, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way contrary to the duety of good Chriſtians, to entertaine a communion with thoſe Churches which hold ſuch a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:32736:13"/>
doctrine as ſeemes to us inconſiſtent with ſome fundamentall Trueth, ſo that in the meane while they doe expreſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive &amp; profeſſe that fundamentall Trueth it ſelfe. For 'tis utterly againſt all Charity, yea and Reaſon too, that a man ſhould be thought (meerely for ſome conſequences, which he neither apprehend's nor grants) to deny and reject a fundamentall point, which yet he ſtrongly beleive's, expreſly affirme's, yea and (if need ſo required) would not ſtick to ſeale the trueth of it with his deareſt blood. How much truer and more charitable is that opinion of a grave and moderate Divine? <hi>We muſt not</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bucer.</note> (ſaith he) <hi>ſo much conſider what will follow in the thing it ſelfe from every aſſertion, as what will follow from it in the apprehenſion and judgement of thoſe who maintaine any ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion as ſeeme's to us repugnant to ſome fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall point of Faith.</hi> For as he who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent's to the trueth of ſome Principle, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore be ſaid properly to beleive and underſtand whatſoever and abler Schollar can by conſequences infer from
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:32736:13"/>
that Principle; ſo neither can he who maintaine's a falſe Opinion, juſtly bee thought to hold all thoſe abſurdities which a nimble head eaſily obſerve's to adhere unto or follow upon that errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Opinion of his. We may indeed urge and preſſe theſe conſequences upon our Brethren, to ſee if haply wee can by this meanes beat them off their errour; but malitiouſly to faſten them upon them, as though they were their profeſt Opinions, this we may not doe.</p>
            <p>How farre this extend's, and of what excellent uſe it is to the ſetling of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly union amongſt the Reformed Churches, all wiſe men and ſuch as unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly deſire the peace of Gods Church, will eaſily perceive. For if it once be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that a Peace and Union is not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible (that is, not unlawfull) ſave onely with ſuch as actually disbeleive ſome fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall point of Faith, or maintaine ſome ſuch Hereſy as ſtrike's at the heart of Religion, and cut's off the Abettors of it from having any communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with Chriſt;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:32736:14"/>
then will it follow, that betwixt a ſound and a diſeaſed Church, betwixt two Churches whereof one is more, the other leſſe pure, there may be ſuch a brotherly communion as we deſire among the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Churches. Let therefore the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe Churches ſeparate themſelves from all ſuch as have plaid the Apoſtates &amp; fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len away from fundamentall Faith; but let them not ſeparate from thoſe which erre onely in points of leſſer moment and ſuch as doe not cut off the maintainers of them from being members of the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body of Chriſt, the ſole author and fountaine of our ſalvation. The Apoſtle command's us <hi>to receive</hi> (not, reject) <hi>ſuch as are weake in the Faith:</hi> And the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 1.</note> tel's us how that <hi>we which are ſtrong,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 1.</note> 
               <hi>ought to beare the infirmities of the weake, &amp; not to pleaſe our ſelves.</hi> That Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe's but too much pleaſe &amp; indulge her ſelfe, which deſpiſe's other Churches, as unworthy of her fellowſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, not for any Tyranny that they exerciſe, nor any Idolatry which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:32736:14"/>
or practiſe, nor any damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie which they maintaine, but meerely for ſome miſtakes or infirmity of their knowledge. This was not the practice of the Fathers in the Primitive Church: whoſe care and diligence in procuring &amp; preſerving Peace amongſt particular Churches diſperſt and ſcattered over the whole world, ſtand's upon record in Eccleſiaſticall Storie and may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved<note place="margin">Magdeburg.</note> in each ſeverall age of the Church. But of all other, that of <hi>Optatus Milevita nus</hi> fit's beſt to our purpoſe; <hi>that all the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Churches throughout the whole world were by the help and entercourſe of thoſe letters by them called</hi> [Formatae] <hi>kept in one Communion and fellowſhip.</hi> Now thoſe [<hi>Formatae</hi>] or Synodicall letters contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned nothing at all ſave onely a bare Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Catholike Faith delivered in their generall Creeds, and breifely explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned afterwards in oppoſition to ſome He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes, by the unanimous conſent of the Church univerſall met together in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

Councells held at <hi>Nice, Chalcedon,</hi> and other places. As for thoſe infinite other queſtions which might be raiſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated amongſt private Doctours of each ſide, no Church ever required or expected from others an abſolute &amp; univerſall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent therein. For if ſuch an univerſall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in all points had been deemed ſo neceſſary as that Unity &amp; Peace could not poſsibly have been maintained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt particular Churches without it, there would then have been more need of huge and high-ſwollne Volumes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, than of ſuch breife Confeſsions and Synodicall letters as they made uſe of for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But if wee refuſe to learne of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers of the Church, yet let us at length learne thus much from our very adverſaries, that it is not a thing impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for ſeverall Churches to live charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and peaceably together, and uſe the ſame Service and Sacraments, although they differ one from another about ſome Controverſies, wherein 'tis meerely in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:32736:15"/>
vaine ever to look for an univerſall agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To ſay nothing of the contentions betwixt the <hi>Thomists</hi> and <hi>Scotiſts,</hi> neither of thoſe between the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites;</hi> there is one controverſie hotly and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently diſputed amongſt Popiſh Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which, if taken ſingle and by it ſelfe, is of greater moment than all ours put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; I meane that concerning the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Judge in all matters of Faith: The Churches of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> will have the <hi>Pope</hi> to be this ſupreme Judge, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed by Chriſt himſelfe, and ſo farre illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated and aſsiſted with an infallible Spirit, as that he cannot poſsibly erre in ſuch Decrees and Determinations as hee give's out with an intention to binde the whole Church: On the other ſide, the <hi>French</hi> Churches deny the Pope any ſuch priviledge, throwing him downe from his Chaire of Infallibility, and making him liable to errour as well as other men; ſo farre forth that ſhould he refuſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the authoritie and judgement of a generall Councell, either in matters of

It is not my purpoſe to enter the liſts of thoſe Controverſies: onely I doe pray and earneſtly intreat thoſe learned &amp; reverend Divines of <hi>Germany,</hi> that laying aſide all paſsion &amp; partialitie, they would in the ſpirit of meekneſſe calmely and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly diſcuſſe all thoſe ſeverall controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:32736:18"/>
we ſtill to urge, and enquire whether that diverſity be ſuch and ſo great as to render the Peace and Union of thoſe Churches utterly impoſsible, and to give juſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for a perpetuall rent and diviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. I aſſure my ſelfe, learned &amp; judicious Divines when they are out of the heat of Controverſy, and look indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently into the matter, will think farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe of it.</p>
            <p>Now as for thoſe other Controverſies, concerning <hi>the ubiquity of Chriſt's body, the Communication of Properties,</hi> &amp; other ſuch like, all ſpringing from that former tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Sacrament, he that doth ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ponder with himſelfe what is granted and what denied of each ſide, will eaſily perceive that neither the one nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth ſo much as call in queſtion, much leſſe oppoſe or overthrow any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and fundamentall point of Faith: ſince both ſides hold and profeſſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Church Catholike in her Creeds and Generall Councells hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be beleived in theſe points; and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:32736:19"/>
whatſoever hath been by her in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner condemned as erroneous, is equally rejected by both. But yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all this, that we ſee now and then ſome men catching at conſequences, and taking advantage from thence to charge Hereſy one upon another, it is a matter that deſerve's not ſo much our wonder as our pitty: we all of us know, 'tis the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cuſtome of hot and eager diſputants, eſpecially when through long agitation of the matter they are inflamed with chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and paſsion: and beſides, I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhowne in breife, what we are to think of ſuch Hereſies as are faſtned upon men meerely for ſuch conſequences as they themſelves neither apprehend nor grant. For the preſent, this alone may ſuffice to ſhow the Poſsibility of a Reconciliation, that there's no one Opinion expreſly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by either ſide, which is directly contrary to the ſubſtance of Faith, or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of Salvation [ſalutis devoratori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um]</hi> to make uſe of <hi>Tertullian's</hi> expreſsion: nay whatſoever is ſuch, is plainly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:32736:19"/>
condemned by both.</p>
            <p>If of later times any new Differences have been raiſed amongſt thoſe Churches touching <hi>Predeſtination, Freewill,</hi> and the like; theſe can no way be made a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground of Schiſme and ſeparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them. For in all theſe there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of fundamentall and neceſſary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife ſave onely this, that the free grace &amp; goodneſſe of God, in the Predeſtination of miſerable men, in the converſion of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, in the freeing of their captivated wills; in a word, in the finall Perſeverance and Salvation of his Elect, be ſo farre forth acknowledged and extoll'd, as that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever makes any way for the enſtating of them in grace and glory, and whatſoever is done by them in reference thereunto, all muſt be aſcribed to the ſpeciall grace and mercy of Almighty God: on the contrary, whatſoever concerne's the corruption of man's nature, his obſtinacie in ſinne, the pravitie and ſervitude of his corrupt will; in ſhort, whatſoever praecipitate's &amp; plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge's wretched men into Hell and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:32736:20"/>
perdition, all this we muſt thank our ſelves &amp; our ſins for, &amp; by no meanes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute any part of it to God. So long as theſe things ſtand firme and unſhaken (as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt they doe) though in the meane time their manner of apprehenſions and expreſsions, yea though their Opinions be different in other points which are onely ſuperſtructions and belong not to the foundation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet are not theſe of ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as that a perpetuall Breach and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion ſhould be made and continued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt whole Churches for ſuch petty matters. If therefore this were but once agreed upon amongſt Divines, that their jarres and contentions are not, nor ever were about any fundamentall points and ſuch as are of abſolute neceſsity to be known and beleived by all that will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then muſt it alſo be granted for a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt trueth, that 'tis no way impoſsible but an agreement and Communion may be eſtabliſhed this dangerous Schiſme ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly rooted out, and a bleſſed Peace ſetled and preſerved amongſt the <hi>German</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:32736:20"/>
And thus having proved that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation is poſsible, it remaine's that in the next place we conſider whether or no Princes, Doctors and Paſtors of Gods Church, and in generall all Chriſtians bee not bound in duty by the law of God, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to endeavour according to his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt power and ability that ſuch an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may with all convenient ſpeed be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and eſtabliſhed amongſt the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches.</p>
            <p>1 And that all men are ſo bound, ſeeme's to be intimated by that of S. <hi>Paul</hi> which I alledged before; <hi>if it be poſsible, &amp; as much as in you lie's, live peaceably with all men.</hi> If ſo great care and diligence muſt be had to maintaine a civill and externall peace with all ſorts of men, then ſurely a ſpirituall &amp; Eccleſiaſticall peace amongſt Chriſtians is much rather to be ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and preſerved, where therefore there is no utter impoſsibility to hinder why ſuch an Union may not be obtained, ſuch men can in no wiſe be excuſed, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of negligence or wilfulneſſe diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:32736:21"/>
the Commandements of God herein. Nor can any man juſtly here pretend that Diſcords and diverſities of Opinions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not as yet be compoſed and ſetled: for if it be poſſible that the Schiſme it ſelfe &amp; the Rent betwixt theſe Churches may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, (as without all queſtion it may) I had rather that a mil-ſtone were<note place="margin">Math. 18.</note> hanged about my neck, and that I were drowned in the depth of the Sea, than that I ſhould willingly be any hinderance to ſo good a work, ſo well-pleaſing to God, and ſo neceſſary to the removall of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall; nay than that I ſhould not with my whole minde and might promote and further it.</p>
            <p>2 To this may be further added, what muſt neceſſarily be confes't by all men, that a true and right order'd Charity is of as great neceſsity for the attaining of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to all Churches and to every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular member in any Church, as is the true and entire Profeſsion of ſound and ſaving Faith: our Lord and Saviour Chriſt Jeſus make's this the badge and cognizance

whereby to diſtinguiſh and diſcerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his true Diſciples and ſuch as are ſpurious and counterfeit; <hi>by this ſhall all</hi>

               <hi>men know that yee are my Diſciples, if yee love one another.</hi> Now I leave it to every man's conſcience to judge, what manner of Charity that is, which ſee's and ſuffer's Chriſtian Churches (without all juſt cauſe and neceſsity) to ſtand ſtill at diſtance and defiance one with another, and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to ſhunne a Reconciliation and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Is it not enough for us to ſeparate from the <hi>hay and ſtubble,</hi> I meane, from the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours<note place="margin">1.

            <p>3 Further yet, we ſee how that both <hi>Zuinglians</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> (as they are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally termed) confeſſe that thoſe Churches which hold with either ſide, doe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſtill remaine true Chriſtian Churches, &amp; true members of the Church Catholike, whereof Chriſt is the head.

            <p>4 Beſides, I am very confident that both the <hi>Saxon,</hi> and <hi>Helvetian,</hi> &amp; all other Churches which joyne with either of thoſe two, will profeſſe that they deſire to have and to retaine a brotherly Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Peace with this our Church of <hi>England,</hi> as alſo with the <hi>Scottiſh, Jriſh,</hi> and all other forraigne Churches of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.

with them. And if they be like affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted towards us, with what reaſon then and equitie doe the <hi>German</hi> Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themſelves of that brotherly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion one with another, which yet they are not afraid to entertaine with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Churches?

            <p>5 Laſt of all, that which all good men are bound to beg of Almighty God in their prayers to him, queſtionleſſe they are bound likewiſe to imploy their beſt care and endeavours for the procuring of it. Now who is there that doe's not daily ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite God for the flouriſhing and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate of his Church? Who is there that make's it not a part of his daily prayers, that God would be pleaſed to remove out of the way whatſoever doth diſquiet and

            <p>What hitherto hath been ſaid, is to ſhow that a Communion and Reconciliation of the <hi>Germane</hi> Churches is a thing, not only poſsible, but in obedience to Gods commandement a neceſſary duty. It now remaine's that J proceed to ſet downe the way and meanes whereby ſuch a Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation may be compaſſed, and the rents and diſtractions of the ſaid Churches may with moſt conveniencie and ſpeed bee made up: which I ſhall doe, rather to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie that vehement deſire &amp; zeale which I have to ſo good a work, than out of any opinion that thoſe famous Churches (which alwaies have abounded with ſtore of learned and pious Divines) can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way ſtand in need of advice herein from me or any other forraigne Divine whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:32736:25"/>Seeing therefore that the fore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Controverſies may be agitated either betwixt ſeverall and diſtinct Churches, whereof one is no way ſubordinate to the other; or elſe betwixt ſuch particular men as are members of the ſame Church, and ſubjects to one &amp; the ſame Prince: J will ſpeak firſt, of divers Churches indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent one upon another, and afterwards of particular men in one &amp; the ſame Church, and ſhow how Peace and Unitie may be made and preſerved amongſt them.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, I conceive there's no readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and better way for reducing of two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Churches to the ſame Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than is that uſuall one of procuring a faire and peaceable Conference amongſt Divines of both ſides, authoriſed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed there unto by their Princes. For if any one imagine, that a Councell being once held of all the Reformed Churches, there will out of hand within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of ſome few moneths, or yeares, yea or in one age, an end be put to all diſputes whatſoever, which have of a long time
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:32736:25"/>
troubled and buſied the Learned, ſo as that they ſhall all joyne and agree in the ſame opinion about all ſuch points of controverſie; this (with ſubmiſsion to better judgements) ſeemes to me very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely. For ſo dull and dim-ſighted is the eye of our underſtanding, that it can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peirce into the depth of ſuch ſubtle and intricate Queſtions, no not when it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, free and undiſturbed in it's contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations: but being diſtracted, by the ſtirs &amp; tumults of diſputation ſo far unable are we to penetrate into the quick of them, that many times we cannot ſo much as diſcerne and perceive them, no not when we look upon them with a fixt and ſteddy eye. And (to ſpeak plainly what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in this matter) the cheife uſe of Councells, eſpecially of Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, is to maintaine and defend thoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and plaine points of Faith againſt the oppoſitions of Hereticks, rather than to diſcuſſe or determine nice controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of leſſer moment and uſe.</p>

Conference, which but now I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for the likelieſt and fitteſt meanes of obtaining an Union: if it could be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken with ſuch an intention, &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged in ſuch ſort, as it ought to be, wee have good cauſe to hope that we ſhall in a ſhort time ſee a bleſſed Peace and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eſtabliſhed amongſt the <hi>Germane</hi> Churches.</p>
            <p>This therefore muſt carefully be reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by all ſuch as ſhall be preſent &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to ſuch a Meeting, that the end why they are called together, is not that like Adverſaries they ſhould ſtrive for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, but rather that they ſhould like Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſearch out and make uſe of all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and warrantable meanes for the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Peace and Unitie. For if once they fall a croſsing and contending one with another, they will never be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, much leſſe to procure any agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt ſuch Churches as are at ods and oppoſition. Let them therefore care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully keep off and forbeare to enter the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate Labyrinths of ordinary diſputes:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:32736:26"/>
&amp; let their meeting aime at this one end, to make it appeare to their Churches, how that there's no juſt cauſe why they ſhould any longer ſtand out and refuſe to joyne hands and be united. To effect this, let it in the firſt place be ſet downe how farre the Church Catholike hath declared her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in each Controverſie, what hath been by her defined and required to be beleived generally by all <hi>ſub Anathemate.</hi> For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout points fundamentall there may ſometimes ariſe ſuch doubts and diſputes as are no way fundamentall: and ſuch, as that the ancient Fathers of the Church, had they been raiſed in their times, would never have attempted a deciſion of them, to the hazard of breeding or foſtering a Schiſme betwixt ſeverall Churches. For inſtance, that God is One in Eſſence, and Three in Perſons diſtinguiſhed one from another; that the Sonne is begotten of the Father; that the holy Ghoſt is the Spirit of both Father and Sonne; that theſe three Perſons are coeternall and coequall; all theſe are fitly determined, and reckoned
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:32736:27"/>
in the number of Fundamentalls: but now if any man ſhould peremptorily affirme and maintaine, that all thoſe Schoole-ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities touching the manner of the Sonne's generation, and the proceſsion of the holy Ghoſt, are likewiſe fundamentall and of equall neceſsity with the former, &amp; ought to be determined one way; that man ſhould deſerve but litle thanks from Chriſt and his Church, by ſuch his raſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate aſſertion. So likewiſe, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is both God and Man; that he hath both natures, divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, inſeparably united in one Perſon; and that we have ſalvation onely by this God incarnate; all this is fundamentall, or rather 'tis that firme &amp; immoveable foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation whereon the whole Catholike &amp; ſaving Faith is built: but yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we muſt not think, that whatſoever may be queſtioned and debated about the ineffable manner of that union betwixt the two natures, or the manner how his body is preſent in the bleſſed Sacrament, as alſo concerning the Communication
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:32736:27"/>
of Properties unto the humane nature by vertue of its union with the Divinity, or touching the actions and operations of his Humanity depending upon the ſaid Uni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, wee muſt not (I ſay) imagine that all theſe belong to Fundamentall Faith, but rather to Theologicall Science, or perhaps not ſo neither, but onely to the vaine curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity of ſome particular Divines. Let them therefore make this their firſt and maine buſineſſe, carefully to diſtinguiſh betwixt fundamentall points and others that are not ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and let them not think, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is appendant and bordering upon a fundamentall point, muſt therefore forthwith be it ſelfe fundamentall.</p>
            <p>When this is once done; their next care muſt be that theſe fundamentalls be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and publiſhed after a breife and perſpicuous manner, and propounded to the publike acceptation and approbation of all the Churches. <hi>Certa ſemper ſunt in paucis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian; certaine and undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Trueths are not many, and they are ſuch as may be delivered in a few words:</hi> whatſoever
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:32736:28"/>
is neceſſary for a Chriſtian man's ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be knowne by him; and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is conducible to render us holy or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy, it is all of it plaine and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Here's no uſe either of ſubtle &amp; acute diſtinctions, or of any long and tedious explications, which are oftimes uſed not for the building up of Chriſtians in the fundamentall faith, but rather to favour and further the different opinions of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Doctors. In a word, here's no uſe of any Metaphyſicall formalities and abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted notions; which ſerve only to perplex and confound the learned, and to deterre ſuch as are unlearned from embracing the Catholike Faith; but doe not any way en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the hearts either of one or other to yeild aſſent and beleife to the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall points of Faith.</p>
            <p>After they have proceeded thus far, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving drawn up a breife and plaine Forme of all ſuch Points as are by them judged to appertaine unto the ſubſtance of that <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Faith</hi> which is neceſſary to be known<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 3.</note> and profeſſed by all Churches; &amp; having
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:32736:28"/>
paſſed by &amp; left undecided all ſuch points as are not ſo generally received &amp; agreed upon; in the next place, moderate &amp; peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Divines ſhould labour to exhort and perſwade all the reſt, that they would quietly lay aſide all controverſies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions about ſuch points as good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may ſafely be ignorant of without hazard of their ſalvation; and that they would not quarrell any longer about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to the danger of the Church, the loſſe of her Peace, and the ſcandall of Schiſme which is thereby like to fall upon her.</p>
            <p>Of what good uſe and neceſſity this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is, may be clearely ſeen from the raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and her clean contrary practice herein: who being not content with thoſe Articles delivered in the Apoſtles Creed, and <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, will needs obtrude upon the Chriſtian world thoſe other new-coin'd Articles of the Trent-conventicle, and hath thereby mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred occaſion of a perpetuall rent and Schiſme amongſt the Churches.

If therefore they can but get an univerſall conſent in all Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls, though in other things there bee ſome difference amongſt private Doctors, yet let them all joyne their votes and voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in this prayer to God, <hi>nulla ſalus bello, pacemte poſcimus omnes; no ſafety can be had or hoped for in warre, therefore give peace in our time ô Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if any here ſhall demand, what courſe is to be taken about ſuch Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies as cannot be decided and agreed upon, that they may not give any occaſion whereby this Peace and Union of the Churches ſhould be hindered, or being obtained ſhould afterwards be diſturbed and loſt; I will ſet down ſome few rules, which to me ſeeme worthy the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and practice of Divines on both ſides.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that whatſoever tart and bitter paſſages have formerly ſlipt from Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries either by word or writing, amids the heat of diſputation, they ſhould all be pardond on both ſides for the publike good, and for ever after buried in ſilence
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:32736:30"/>
and oblivion. And if it happen that any of thoſe books and writings ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be reprinted; before they paſſe the Preſſe, let them firſt be purged of all gall &amp; bitterneſſe, which otherwiſe would but rub up and renew the old ſore of ſtrife &amp; contention amongſt brethren.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe no man can with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience heare himſelfe branded with Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, heed muſt be taken that none be ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with the name of <hi>Neſtorian, Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chian,</hi> or any other condemned Hereticke, ſo long as he doth expreſly denie and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime the damn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d Opinions of ſuch He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks: ſeeing it is utterly impoſsible that ever they ſhould continue firme in a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Communion and concord, who for every petty difference in Opinion ceaſe not by ſuch reproachfull and reviling termes to provoke and exaſperate one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And it were to be wiſhed further, that thoſe ſiding names of <hi>Lutherans, Zuinglians, Calviniſts,</hi> were all laid aſide; which are badges rather of Faction than any fraternall Union, anh ſuch as the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

            <p>Thirdly, that all profound and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Points be let alone and not medled with in Sermons preached to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, or in any ſuch books as are publiſht in the Vulgar tongue; let them be accounted rather the exerciſe and buſines
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:32736:31"/>
of the Schooles, than any fit food &amp; nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment for men's ſoules. Such perplex'd Diſputes may very well be ſpared in the Pulpit; but Charity, which uſually is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by the handling and diſcuſsing of them, cannot be ſpared or wanting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians, without the utmoſt danger and hazard of their ſoules. The common people doe but play and ſport with ſuch Controverſies, they are no whit profited by them; and in the end, not well underſtanding them, they give over ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and fall a quarrelling and contending about them.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, if Divines ſhall hereafter have a minde to diſperſe or publiſh and Diſcourſes about theſe Points, let them doe it according to that grave advice of <hi>Greg. Nazianzen, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Hitherto have I laid down the meanes and manner how an Union may be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and continued betwixt ſeverall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Churches. But becauſe it may and often doth happen, that there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers men, both learned and unlearned, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the ſame Church and within the Dominions of the ſame Prince, whoſe conſciences (whether rightly or miſinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) will not ſuffer them to ſubſcribe to the common and more generally received Opinion in theſe Controverſies; let us in the next place enquire, what courſe is beſt to be taken concerning ſuch men.</p>
            <p>And here, the Governours of each ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Church if they have any regard &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ſafety of their weak Brethren, they muſt ſee that they doe not intermixe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:32736:32"/>
with the publike Confeſſions and Articles of Religion, which they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and aſſented unto by all ſuch as live under their Juriſdiction, any curious and unneceſſary Controverſies, nor any deciſions of nice and ſubtle Queſtions; but rather they muſt take care that ſuch pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Confeſsions be framed and temper'd to the capacity of the common people, ſo as they may inſtruct &amp; edify the ignorant, and promote the ſalvation of all. Herein they ſhould doe well to conſider the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our Fore-fathers; whoſe ancient Confeſsions (unleſſe we corrupt &amp; ſtuffe them with new Opinions of our own, on purpoſe to diſturb the publike Peace) no ſober and diſcreet man will refuſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe unto them. Neither is there any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity why we ſhould burden our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Confeſsions with any ſuch additions of our own; ſince God himſelfe hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to bring his people to heaven and happines, not through the rough &amp; knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty paths of perplex'd &amp; intricate Diſputes, but by the ſmooth and compendious way
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:32736:32"/>

               <hi>wholy placed in beleiving and ſerving God,</hi> as that great <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſometimes gravely ſpake.</p>
            <p>Adde to this, that they will have much adoe to maintaine a firme peace with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, who ceaſe not to perſecute men and expell them their Communion (as if they were Hereticks) onely becauſe they maintain that Doctrine which thoſe other Churches hold and profeſſe: for in ſo doing, what doe they elſe but tacitly charge Hereſy upon other Churches? whom though in word they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for their Brethren, yet they hereby ſhow that in their hearts they much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve and diſlike them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, unleſſe the publike Confeſsions of Churches be cnofined to ſuch Points onely as are fundamentall and generally received by all the Reformed Churches, this inconvenience muſt of neceſsity fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:32736:33"/>
thereupon, that many learned, pious, and peaceable Miniſters ſhall be driven out &amp; diſenabled from exerciſing the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery in thoſe Churches wherein they live.</p>
            <p>But if any man doubt, whether or no ſuch men may lawfully entertaine a holy and ſpirituall Communion one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in the ſame Church, who yet agree not amongſt themſelves in all Points of Divinity; this (as I conceive) is a matter out of all doubt and queſtion. For as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that bleſſed Communion which is betwixt Chriſtians at the receiving of the Lord's Supper, it conſiſt's cheifly in theſe particulars, that by the common bond of the bleſſed Spirit we are all united to that ſole head of the Church Chriſt Jeſus; that by the ſame Spirit, and by Faith and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity we are united amongſt our ſelves and linked together as it were into one body; that laſtly, like men fed at the ſame table, we are all of us nouriſhed up unto eternall life with the ſame quickning food, to wit the body and blood of Chriſt: in all theſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:32736:33"/>
particulars doe they profeſſe a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whoſoever approach and are admitted to that holy Table. But now as we doe not by this mutuall Communion profeſſe our ſelves to have attained all of us either to perfection or to an equall meaſure of knowledge in Divinity: ſo neither doe we hereby profeſſe, that there is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and exact agreement amongſt us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout all Points of Divinity, or that we are all of us in one and the ſame Opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout all Diſputes and Controverſies. If no Communion could be had amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but upon ſuch hard termes as theſe, I beleive it would hardly be found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul;</hi> certaine I am the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> muſt of neceſsitie have fallen in peices; and in theſe times of ours there would not eaſily be found ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Divines of note and eminence, which could with a ſafe conſcience communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate together at the ſame holy Sacrament and Supper of our Lord. It is therefore the duty of all Church-Governours (as being conſcious to themſelves of the common
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:32736:34"/>
infirmities of all men, both themſelves &amp; others) to take heed leaſt while they exact of their People a too ſtrict and punctuall Confeſsion of more than what's neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they thereby wound and weaken the ſweet Peace and Unity of Chriſtendome, than which nothing more neceſſary. So much for Church-Governours.</p>
            <p>Come we in the next place to ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and other Chriſtians of what ſtate and condition ſoever, as deſire to continue in the Communion of thoſe Churches wherein they live, but yet their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will not permit them to allow &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe all the common and received Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſaid Churches. Such men muſt ſee that they ſhow themſelves teachable and tractable, and not perſiſt after a proud and pertinacious manner in defence of thoſe Opinions wherein they diſſent from their Church. Now ſuch a one is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>teachable</hi> and <hi>tractable,</hi> who lends a willing and attentive eare to the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and information of the Church; who doe's not diſſent from her out of any
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:32736:34"/>
perverſe and peeviſh humour, but meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the weakneſſe of his judgement, being not able in ſuch profound Points to diſcerne that Trueth which men of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter learning and more acute wits eaſily ſee and perceive. And becauſe it is the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar prerogative of Almighty God to ſearch the hearts, it behoves us Chriſtians to encline alwaies to the more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and more charitable ſide; and, where we have not cleare and evident reaſons for the contrary, we ought to judge of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man that he denies his aſſent rather out of conſcience than contumacy and perverſeneſſe.</p>
            <p>They who thus behave themſelves, are not to be excluded and expelled the Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>munion of thoſe Churches wherein they live, for petty miſtakes and errours in their Opinions: but yet with this caution and condition, that they take not upon them to oppoſe the received Opinion of the Church, or to publiſh &amp; ſpread their own private Opinion amongſt the common people. Nor can they juſtly diſlike of this
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:32736:35"/>
caution or take it ill, whoſoever have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to live peaceably in the Communion of the Church: for admit that the private Opinion of ſome Divine or any other Chriſtian, be true; and the publike judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, erroneous: yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, if the Errour be ſuch as doe's not prejudice a Chriſtian man's ſalvation, it is much better that the true Opinion of any private man whatſoever ſhould quietly lie hid in ſilence and obſcurity, than that the publike authority of the Church ſhould be openly contemned and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on, or that the Churche's Peace, by this unneceſſary conflict of jarring Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as by two contrary windes, ſhould be ſhaken and torne in peices. But if any man be perſwaded in his conſcience, that his private Opinion wherein hee differ's from the Church, is of ſuch moment and importance as that men cannot be ſaved without the knowledge of it; ſuch a one, if he cannot perſwade and convince the Rulers and Governours of his Church in this matter, muſt either turne aſide into
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:32736:35"/>
ſome other Church, or elſe (for the good of men's ſoules) patiently ſubmit to ſuch cenſures as the Church in which he live's ſhall inflict upon him.</p>
            <p>This is it (moſt learned Sir) which at your requeſt I thought good to write and ſend unto you. If it may ſtand you or any man elſe in any ſteed for the advancing of the Churche's Peace, I have all my wiſh &amp; ayme for which I penned it. They who are better acquainted with the preſent ſtate and affaires of the <hi>Germane</hi> Churches than I am, will be able (no doubt) to give you fuller and better advice herein. For my ſelfe, it remaine's onely that I humbly beſeech Almighty God, that he would move and encline the hearts of Princes, earneſtly to deſire this bleſſed Union of our Churches; that he would enlighten the underſtandings of Divines to find out and follow after ſuch meanes as may moſt conduce to the ſpeedy eſtabliſhing of it; that laſtly he would enflame the hearts of all Chriſtians to embrace this Peace, &amp; bequeath it to all poſterity. The God of

Peace grant this for the ſake of his deare Sonne, the ſole Author &amp; procurer of our Peace. To whom with the bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be all honour, glory, &amp; thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving world without end.</p>

ought they to diſquiet the Peace either of any Chriſtian ſoule, or of God's holy Church. What doe we profeſsing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Charity and love, if we ſtill obſtinately refuſe to indulge our Brethren this litle li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of diſſenting from us in doubtfull &amp; difficult Schoole-queſtions? Seeing wee know very well that our good and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Saviour paſſed over with ſilence and toleration great and greivous Errours in compariſon of theſe (if it be granted that theſe are Errours,) and that too even in ſuch as were of his owne houſhold and retinue.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>There are but <hi>three</hi> things about which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Divines of both ſides profeſſe themſelves to differ.</head>
               <p>THE firſt is, whether or no our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt be truly om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient, omnipotent, and omnipreſent not only according to his Divinity, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo according to his humane nature, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the perſonall Union? That the Lord
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32736:48"/>
Jeſus (to wit God and Man) is in both his natures omniſcient, omnipotent, and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſent, is confeſt on each ſide: this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted, the word [<hi>according</hi>] is a meere Schoole-nicity. How farre the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that hypoſtaticall union extend's it ſelfe, the holy ghoſt is ſilent, and a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an may ſafely be ignorant of it. Let the Doctors, if they liſt, diſpute and buſie their braines as much as they pleaſe about this matter: it will be enough for a Chriſtian, to knowe that he hath a Saviour who is both God and man, to whom all theſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes truely belong and appertaine. Nay even Divines themſelves have enough wherein they may reſt ſatisfied, ſo long as this be granted on both ſides, that even the humane nature conſidered perſonally is omniſcient, omnipreſent, &amp; omnipotent: which wee all of us roundly and readily profeſſe without any doubt or ſcruple. O what enimies are we to Peace, if we will yet needs quarrell amongſt our ſelves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> In all this, I wiſh we would carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that uſefull diſtinction of <hi>John</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:32736:49"/>
                  <hi>Gerſon, eſſe quaedam de neceſsitate fidei, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam verò de fidei devotione: that there are ſome things eſſentiall and neceſſary to Faith, other ſome things which ſhee piouſly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly beleives,</hi> but yet they are not of ſuch neceſſity as the other: the former are ſuch as may not ſo much as bee once doubted of, but theſe latter may admit of an <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; we may ſafely either ſuſpend our aſſent unto them, or poſitively diſſent from them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Article wherein they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, is concerning the manner of receiving Chriſt in the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> Both agree, that Chriſt's body is truly and really given, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and eaten in this Sacrament together with the outward Elements: All the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is concerning <hi>Vnworthy receivers.</hi> An unworthy Queſtion truly it is, that the publike Peace ſhould any way be diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed about it. We willingly grant both of us, that even ſuch as are <hi>Vnworthy</hi> doe eat that which by a ſacramentall Union is Chriſt's body; and that therefore they are guilty of the body and blood of Jeſus
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32736:49"/>
Chriſt: What doe wee now making any more adoe about the manner of their ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, whether it be <hi>Orall</hi> or not? Let Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians make this their care, that they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may be found worthy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, and let them not trouble themſelves to knowe how thoſe which are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy are partakers of Chriſt. How farre the vertue of that Sacramental Union extends it ſelfe, and whether the manner of this eating be <hi>Orall</hi> or <hi>Spirituall,</hi> let the Schools diſpute it: Chriſtians need not be too curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in enquiring after it; nor is it fit wee ſhould diſquiet the Churche's Peace, by refuſing to indulge mutually one another a liberty of Opinion in ſuch nice Points.</p>
               <p>The third Article is that fatall Point of <hi>Praedeſtination:</hi> about which, Divines of both ſides expreſſe themſelves variouſly, but yet modeſtly and diſcreetly. In many things, and ſuch as are of moſt moment, their judgements on both ſides are the ſame: as, that election is moſt free, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the meere mercy of God, that God found not any cauſe or occaſion
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32736:50"/>
in thoſe whom hee elected, the ſight whereof might move him to chuſe them rather than others: but that he did from all eternity reprobate and praedeſtinate to eternall damnation ſuch as perſevere and perſiſt in their ſinnes and infidelity; not by any rigid and abſolute decree, without having any reſpect or regard to ſin, but out of his moſt juſt judgement: ſo as all the cauſe &amp; the blame of it ought to be ſought for in the men themſelves. In this they are at a ſtand; that the foreſight of Faith and Perſeverance is by the reverend Divines of <hi>Saxony</hi> placed before the act of God's Election: ſo as God did from everlaſting foreordaine ſuch as he fore-ſaw would in time beleive, &amp;c. Certainly of all the Queſtions about Praedeſtination, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the order of his Decree is leaſt materiall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing we know aſſuredly that the infinite &amp; all-wiſe diſpoſer of things performes all this with one ſingle &amp; moſt ſimple act. There is nothing more certain than that God did foreſee who would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, and that he did praedeſtinate ſuch as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32736:50"/>
ſhould be ſaved: let but this then be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (which they of <hi>Saxony</hi> willingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) that Faith is the ſole gift of God, and that whatſoever good there is in the Elect, all of it doth originally proceed from the free grace &amp; meere mercy of God, which was beſtowed on them in Jeſus Chriſt from all Eternity; I ſay, let this be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and doubtleſſe there can be no danger in that Opinion of <hi>Praeviſion</hi> or fore-ſight: God from everlaſting fore-ſaw that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he himſelfe from everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to beſtow in time upon ſuch as ſhould beleive. All this is ſound and ſafe, nor is there any cauſe why any further ſtrife &amp; contention ſhould be made here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about.</p>
               <p>In all this, I embrace and applaud this Chriſtian and brotherly moderation and holy deſires of Peace: thus it becomes Chriſtians, thus it becomes Divines. I am much deceived, if this modeſt and ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable appeaſing and calming of men's minds doe's not promiſe a firme and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Peace to God's Church. Thou

God of Peace, in thy good time accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it: give eare to the prayers of thy People, and grant that all Chriſtians may be of one heart and one way, till at length we come, by Thee who art the Way, to Thee who art the Life. <hi>Amen,</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Have read over, with a great deale of delight, the Tranſcript you ſent me of that Decree for Peace, which was lately ſigned by all the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant States and Delegates aſſembled at <hi>Franckfort:</hi> than which Decree, nothing (in my Opinion) could poſsibly have been deviſed more full of prudence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: nor doe I ſee (as the caſe now ſtand's) what more could be once hoped for; or what could poſsibly have beene

propoſed and reſolved upon that might more conduce to the advancement of the publike Peace, which all good men ſo much wiſh and deſire. Thus it was meet that the holy Citizens of God's Church, that pious Princes and Peeres ſhould thus carefully provide for the Peace and ſafety of Chriſtendome And bleſſed be God, the beſtower of every good gift<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Author of Peace, who did put into their noble hearts thoſe holy deſires and purpoſes: may the ſame good God be pleaſed, at length to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh this his owne work ſo hopefully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and crowne it with ſucceſſe.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32736:53"/>
the ſenſe is ſo doubtfully expreſſed, that the Author himſelfe did not thinke it ſafe to adhere to the letter of it. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Chriſtian Faith is, amongſt us all, one and the ſame, entire and unſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; there's not ſo much as one ſtone in it, or the leaſt peice of coement, about which any queſtion either is or can be made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Foundation there are built certain Points of Schoole-divinity, about which alone we ſo hotly contend: but what are theſe to a Chriſtian? What are theſe to Salvation? In what a ſafe and quiet ſtate might the affaires of Chriſtendome have been, if ſuch nice Diſputes of curious and over-buſie heads had never been heard of; if learned men could have contented the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſome generall formes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsing the Trueth, and not preſently to have ſifted Divinity ſo over-nearly as they have done?</p>
            <p>But ſeeing theſe ſtrifes, which are not onely unprofitable, but very hurtfull and prejudiciall to both ſides, are thus unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately raiſed; what better advice can be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32736:54"/>
thought upon for the ſetling and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of theſe ſtirres, than that the Faith be brought back againe to its primitive ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie and plaineneſſe, by the publike au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and joynt conſent of the Chriſtian Church? And that in this confuſed mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and multiplicity of matters of beleife, the Chriſtian world be taught warily to diſtinguiſh betwixt the genuine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Articles of Faith, and the leſſe neceſſary additions of Schoole-concluſions: which truely in this very buſineſſe is a matter of no great difficulty to performe. This eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially is fundamentall, <hi>Chriſt is both</hi> God <hi>and</hi> Man; and ſo likewiſe this, <hi>Chriſt, God and Man, is truely omniſcient, omnipotent, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſent:</hi> now if any ſhall adde further, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, according to his humane nature, is omniſcient, omnipotent, omnipreſent;</hi> truely that word [<hi>according</hi>] ſeemes to be farre off from the Foundation; 'tis a Scholaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call notion, and to be turned over to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Divines; but it is not fit the Salvation of plaine and illiterate Chriſtians ſhould be made to hang and depend upon ſuch a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32736:54"/>
ſubtle and nice Point as this is. Can theſe knowe, or are they bound to know, how farre the vertue of the hypoſtaticall Union extend's it ſelfe, or what the bounds are either of thoſe faculties or operations which flow from that union of the two natures? Certainely if God had intended this for a neceſſary Point to be knowne by all men, he would not ſo ſparingly and obſcurely have revealed unto his Church a myſtery ſo fundamentall and important. I diſpute not the trueth of the Point, (nor is this pertinent to my purpoſe,) onely I queſtion whether it be of neceſsity to be beleived. Let us view a compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt things humane &amp; divine, although what ſimilitude can there bee'twixt Earth and Heaven? Man conſiſts of a ſoule and a body united one to the other: and yet notwithſtanding, each part hath its ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall properties and actions, which are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attributed (and that very rightly too) to the whole; the whole man hath the uſe of ſenſe, doth underſtand, eat, walke, ſleep, dye: thus much even ſenſe &amp; reaſon doth
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:32736:55"/>
unanſwerably evince: will any man here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſay, that this alſo is of equall neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be knowne, <hi>man according to his body hath the uſe of ſenſe and reaſon; and according to his ſoule he doth eat, walke, ſleep, and dye?</hi> Truly the ſame that Reaſon is, in reſpect of intelligible matters; the ſame is Faith, in things ſpirituall and divine: I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, how much they differ in their Subjects; yet nevertheleſſe the neceſsity of the things which are either to be known or beleived, is alike different in both. Such Trueths therefore as are certaine, ſuch as are neceſſarily to be beleived, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently fundamentall, let us all unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embrace and profeſſe them: as for the reſt, let Divines (if they pleaſe) buſie their heads with them, but let not the plaine &amp; common ſort of Chriſtians trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about them more than needs.

your ſecond Letter dated from <hi>London March</hi> 20. that we would give you our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion concerning the Conference at <hi>Lipſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich;</hi> the rather, becauſe that Conference is likely to have ſome effect and influence upon the buſines you have in hand. Thus therefore; that meeting (though it was called for other ends and reaſons) yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was holden with ſuch good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, and that the cheife Divines of both ſides had ſo faire &amp; freindly a Conference, heard one another with ſuch patience, &amp; parted with ſuch love and brotherly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it is a very good ſigne that this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is from the Lord, and from this good beginning who can chuſe but hope for a happy and ſucceſſefull iſſue?</p>
            <p>But yet notwithſtanding, they parted differing about three Points: it is well that they differd but in three; &amp; 'tis better yet, that even in thoſe three Points they agreed in moſt things, and ſuch as are of greateſt moment; nor was their difference ſo much about the thing it ſelfe, as about ſome Formes of expreſſion, which for the

moſt part we cannot ſo eaſily forget and caſt off after we have been long accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to them.

               <hi>Paul's</hi> exclamation, <hi>O the depth!</hi> and that 'tis both lawfull &amp; ſufficient for them to reſt and hold together in thoſe cleare &amp; undoubted Trueths; namely, that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, was made in Chriſt; that the deſtruction of all ſuch as periſh, is from themſelves; that Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is from God; that Faith (yea even fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen Faith) is not from our ſelves, it is the gift of God, that we may not boaſt of any thing, ſeeing we have nothing of our own; all muſt be aſcribed to God: as <hi>S.

Wee cannot chuſe therefore but greatly approve, commend, and admire the purpoſes and endeavours of thoſe worthy men who have imployed their paines in ſo neceſſary a worke: but ſince we underſtand how that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to knowe more particularly what our Opinion is of this whole buſineſſe, let us proceed to ſet downe (as breifly and plainly as we can) our judgement herein.</p>
            <p>Indeed it were much to be wiſhed, that they who profeſſe themſelves Chriſt's Diſciples and followers, would all think and ſpeake alike of matters ſpirituall and Divine; <hi>perfectly joyned together in the ſame minde and in the ſame judgement,</hi> (as <hi>S. Paul</hi> exhorts his <hi>Corinthians.</hi>) But ſince there is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32736:65"/>
ſo much weakneſſe in man's underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ſo great difficulty in Points of Divinity, that this perfect and abſolute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement betwixt pious men is a thing not to be had or hoped for in this world; in the next place it were to be wiſhed, that they would agree and be of the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife about the maine &amp; principall Heads of Religion: and for other matters which are of leſſe moment and uſe, and ſuch as do not any way make either for holineſſe of life, or comfort of men's conſciences, &amp; conſequently doe not neceſſarily pertaine to Chriſt's kingdome (which conſiſts in thoſe two things) that they would in ſuch wiſe beleive them, as to beare with others who diſſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them about ſuch Points. For as we ſee in civill &amp; ſaecular matters, the beſt Stateſ-men are not alwaies of the ſame Opinion concerning the affaires of the Commonwealth; ſo likewiſe in the Church, ſo long as the ſumme and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Religion is agreed upon &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, no matter though in ſome other Points the judgements of the Faithfull be

            <p>Yet is not this ſo to be underſtood, as if all manner of Differences in Religion were to be tolerated: for even the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle denounceth an <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt ſuch as ſhall preach any other Goſpell than that which he had preached; and the moſt moderate amongſt the Fathers of the Chriſtian Church have alwaies conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held, that we are to ſhunne and avoid the company of Hereticks. For there bee ſome Opinions of thoſe men who differ about Religion, which overthrow the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry foundation of our Salvation, &amp; deſtroy either that Piety or that Charity which wee are commanded by God's word to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32736:66"/>
practiſe towards God and men: ſuch are the erroneous Doctrines of <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> who will have that religious worſhip gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to creatures, which God hath reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved peculiar to himſelfe; who make our Faith to rely upon the judgement and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of men; who ſeverall waies over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Preiſtly office of Jeſus Chriſt; in a word, who have with their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions ſo ſtained and deformed the whole Chriſtian Religion, that they have left no one part in it ſound and untainted. Such likewiſe are the Opinions of <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who (to let paſſe their other Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) deny our Lord and Saviour Chriſt Jeſus to be truely God: and if once you take away his Divinity, it will neceſſarily follow, that either wee worſhip a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or elſe that we doe not worſhip the ſonne of God; both of which are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly repugnant to thoſe Trueths which are delivered to us in holy Writ as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to Salvation. We conceive therefore that no Peace in way of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can be had with theſe men, nor with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32736:67"/>
any others who maintaine any Errours of this nature, till they ſhall renounce theſe their private Doctrines. But for thoſe who hold ſome erroneous Opinion which yet may conſiſt with Piety, &amp; Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and all Chriſtian duties belonging thereunto, we think (as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſeeme's to have determined) a Communion may be held with them. Wee may mildly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſuch, and when opportunity is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, diſcreetly reprove and inſtruct them; but to caſt them out of the Church, and (for no other cauſe) to curſe and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them as men in a deſperate and damnable eſtate, this (in our opinion) is neither fitting nor lawfull to be done.</p>
            <p>Now to apply this to the matter in hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we conceive that to this latter ſort all thoſe Controverſies doe belong which are agitated amongſt Proteſtant Divines, touching <hi>Chriſt's preſence in the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ignes,</hi> touching <hi>divine Praedestination,</hi> and ſome few other Points. For they doe agree in all ſuch Points as conduce either to Piety towards God, or Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32736:67"/>
men; they maintain on both ſides, that the Scriptures are of divine inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they are perfect, perſpicuous, and authenticall; they deteſt with one heart &amp; mouth the Tyranny, and pernitious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Pope, and they equally keep off from entertaining a Communion with him; they have the ſame Sacraments; they worſhip the ſame Chriſt; they profeſſe the ſame righteouſneſſe and holineſſe in this life, and they expect the ſame glory in the life to come: in a word, ſo great and ſo wonderfull an agreement is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them about all ſaving and neceſſary Doctrines, that (did not the hiſtory of their affaires, and thoſe bitter contentions which have hitherto (more is the pitty) been fomented amongſt them, witneſſe the contrary) there's no man but would thinke they had a meeting at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and by common counſell &amp; conſent agreed upon the ſame Confeſsion of Faith. In ſuch a multitude of myſteries, who can chuſe but admire that there ſhould not be above one or two Points
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32736:68"/>
wherein they did not fully agree? For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven about the Euchariſt, which is the maine matter of this woefull Diviſion, they both of them grant that 'tis a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not a Sacrifice; that it is to be eaten, not worſhipped; both the two kindes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by our Saviour Chriſt (to wit, bread and wine) are neither tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated nor divided one from the other by either ſide; they both acknowledge the ſame uſe and end of this holy Rite, to wit the commemorating of Chriſt's death, &amp; the partaking of his body which was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and of his blood which was ſhed for us: There is onely one thing about which they diſagree, namely the manner how Chriſt's body is given to us and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by us in that Sacrament; the thing is the ſame on both ſides, onely the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it is divers. This Difference, though it be but ſmall, yet is it not (wee confeſſe) altogether of no moment: but that it ſhould be of ſo great moment, as that it ought to make a breach of charity and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection amongſt Brethren, a duty ſo uſeful
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32736:68"/>
and neceſſary to the Chriſtian world, and ſo miraculouſly wrought amongſt them by the hand of Heaven, this we utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Neither doe We alone deny it: to ſay nothing of our Brethren in <hi>Poland,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the <hi>Germans</hi> which hold with us, who (as it is well knowne to all men) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did, and at this day doe make the ſame reckoning and account of that Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy as we but now did; to ſay nothing likewiſe of thoſe famous Divines of both ſides in <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandenburge,</hi> who (as we have been informed) were lately of the very ſame opinion concerning theſe Points, when they had fairely diſcuſſed them at <hi>Lipſwich,</hi> whither they were come with their Princes. But one thing there is which we cannot here omit to mention, a matter perhaps not ſo well knowne to forraine nations, yet ſuch a matter it is as we confidently beleive will be moſt wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and acceptable to all good &amp; peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men, to wit that the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches here in <hi>France</hi> (whereof there are good ſtore) have alwaies been of that ſame
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32736:69"/>
Opinion touching theſe Controverſies, &amp; they have given teſtimony of this their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, both heretofore ſundry waies, and likewiſe now very lately by an expreſſe Decree made in a generall Synod held here at <hi>Charenton</hi> neare <hi>Paris</hi> in the yeare 1631. For when, upon occaſion of a citizen of <hi>Lions</hi> (unto whoſe daughter a certaine young <hi>German</hi> of the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as they call it, was a ſuiter) it was queſtiond, how we are to account and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of ſuch as are commonly termed <hi>Lutherans;</hi> all the Brethren which were there met, out of all the Provinces of <hi>France,</hi> and ſent thither from their ſeveral Churches, did unanimouſly vote thus; <hi>That ſeeing the Churches of the</hi> Auguſtane <hi>Confeſsion doe agree with the other Reformed Churches in all the Principles and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Points of true Religion, and that in their Diſcipline and forme of Divine worſhip there is neither Idolatry nor Superſtition: ſuch of the Faithfull of that Confeſsion as ſhall with the ſpirit of Charity and in a truly peaceable way joyne themſelves unto the publike Aſſemblies</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:32736:69"/>
               <hi>of the Churches in this Kingdome, and deſire to communicate with them, may, without the abjuration of their former Opinions which they hold contrary to the beleife of theſe Churches, be admitted to the holy Table, contract marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with the faithfull of our Confeſsion, and preſent themſelves in the quality of Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the children which ſhall be baptized; upon their promiſe given to the Conſiſtory, that they will never ſolicite ſuch children, directly or indirectly, againſt the Doctrine beleived and profeſſed in our Churches, but ſhall content themſelves with giving them inſtruction onely in thoſe Points wherein we all agree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are not ignorant, how that many objections may be made againſt this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree by ſuch as have a mind to contend &amp; cavill: but ſuch objections they are, moſt of them, as have but litle ſtrength and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in them, and ſuch as can no way ſtand in compariſon with thoſe waighty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons wherewith the Chriſtian Faith and Charity doe furniſh us. It is not our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to inſiſt on every particular; onely in general, we think it not amiſſe to put men
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32736:70"/>
in minde of two things, which if they were obſerved with that care as it fitting, both ſides perhaps would henceforth judge more mildly and charitably of each other than hitherto they have done.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, ſpeciall heed would be taken by us, that the aſſertions and Opinions of private men, though Doctors, though of never ſo great eſteem and repute amongſt their own men, be not father'd on that whole Church wherein ſuch men live, as the common and generally received Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of them all. For what can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more unequall, than that one man's crime, or commendation, ſhould be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all? and what by him hath been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken well or ill, ſhould be rewarded or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who were ſo farre from deſerving any ſuch matter, as that many times ſuch things are faſtned on them as they never ſo much as once heard of from others, or once thought thereupon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The generall Doctrine of each ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Church is laid downe and compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in publike Confeſsions, ſeverall for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32736:70"/>
each ſide; Their's (namely the Doctrine of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> party) in the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Confeſsion (as they terme it;) that of the other ſide, in many ſeverall Confeſsions, diverſly expreſſed according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Countries and Kingdomes. From theſe are we to judge and eſteeme what is held and maintained by both: ſeeing they doe all profeſſe themſelves to aſſent and adhere to theſe, and that they will live &amp; dye in this Faith. But (for ought I know) neither doe they ſo generally approve the writings of <hi>Brentius</hi> or <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> nor doe theſe ſo farre magni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie <hi>Piſcator</hi> or <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> as if they would that whatſoever is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by thoſe men, ſhould be admitted and acknowledged as the common and neceſſary Faith of all Chriſtians. Nay ſo farre are they both of them from this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they themſelves freely reprove and cenſure their own men, and mark out many paſſages in their writings, as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the common and received Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of their Church. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low's, that the ſayings of ſuch men, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:32736:71"/>
they be, are unjuſtly, and (to ſpeake the moſt favourably of it) prepoſterouſly fatherd on the whole Church in which they lived. And yet notwithſtanding, what elſe are all thoſe Tenents with which Proteſtant Divines caſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the teeth, with which they up braid one another as if they were the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and generall faults of the two adverſe parts, and for which they ſo labour to draw one another into envy &amp; contempt? I ſay, what elſe are they but the private Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of ſome particular Doctors on both ſides, vented many times either in choler and paſsion, or out of a vehement zeale to maintaine their Cauſe, when they were hard preſſed &amp; put to it either with the difficulty of the things themſelves, or the ſubtilty of an acute adverſary; and ſo, ſpake rather out of neceſsity than judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and premeditation. For truely ſo ſound and untainted are the publike Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsions of our Churches on each ſide, that there is very litle and hardly any thing which either of them can finde wanting
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:32736:71"/>
in the other's Confeſsion. Our Divines in <hi>Germany</hi> doe commend the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Confeſsion; and no doubt but our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the <hi>Lutherans</hi> will in like manner approve of ours, for the farre greater part of it, would they but once be pleaſed to read it over impartially without paſsion and prejudice. Certainly neither in that Confeſsion of theirs ſhall any man meet with that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquity</hi> of Chriſt's body, which wee condemne in <hi>Lutheraniſme;</hi> nor in this of ours, that <hi>Stoicall Fate</hi> ſo much objected againſt us.</p>
            <p>But a ſecond fault there is, very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent amongſt men of both ſides, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt hereditary, which ought (as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) with all care and diligence to bee ſhun'd and avoided in this buſineſſe. namely, that they who maintaine any Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, ſhould not bee thought to hold whatſoever ſeemes to us to follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon by the rules of diſputation. For it often fall's out, that he who hold's a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple from which ſuch a Concluſion is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, may notwithſtanding be utterly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:32736:72"/>
of that which is in ferred from his Principle. For inſtance, he that firſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Loadſtone to point towards the North Pole, did not forth with perceive all the ſeverall experiments that have been afterwards made from thence for the uſe and benefit of Navigation: for Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons lye hid and buried in their Principles, nor are they deduced thence without ſome paines and ſtudy. He therefore who hold's ſome Principle, and withall doth either not heed and regard it; or elſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it, but with an Intellect which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dull or prepoſſeſſed with anger or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or ſome other paſsion, this man, from that Principle of his which hee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand's, doth not ſtraightway under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand whatſoever may be knowne and concluded from it. Thus they who live in the Papacy, having their mindes bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched (that I may ſo ſpeake) with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their Leaders, though they grant with us that the ſinnes of men are moſt fully expiated by that ſacrifice offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up by Chriſt on the Croſſe, yet can
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:32736:72"/>
they not hence conclude (although it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently follow hereupon) that their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Altar is vaine and ſuperfluous. Now as he who underſtand's ſome one Trueth, is ſometimes ignorant of other Trueths which are conſequent thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo likewiſe he who hath ſome erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Opinion, muſt not therefore be thought to hold and maintaine all the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities that may be inferred from it: for there's the ſame account to bee made of conſequences either way. Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> of old, and many of the ancient Fathers, taught that the humane ſoule is derived from the Father to the Sonne by way of propagation; but that 'tis mortall, which followes upon the former, this they were ſo farre from granting, that they did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies expreſſely deny it. As therefore wee doe not ſay that the Papiſts doe therefore deny their Sacrifice of the Altar, becauſe they grant (as we doe) the perfection and ſufficiency of that Sacrifice which was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up by Chriſt on the croſſe, though in all good conſequence this overthrowes
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:32736:73"/>
that ſacrifice of theirs: ſo neither doe we think that <hi>Tertullian,</hi> &amp; others of the ſame Opinion touching the originall of man's ſoule, ought to be charged for holding the Soule to be mortall, becauſe this latter er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſeeme's to be deducible from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>Now then how extreme faulty in this kinde Divines of both ſides have beene, who is there that ſee's not? For we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly charge our Brethren (the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi>) with <hi>Eutychianiſme,</hi> (though they in the meane time deny and diſclaime it,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this errour, as we think, follows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Doctrine concerning the Lord's ſupper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they againe on the other ſide, ſtick not to charge us with I knowe not what monſtrous Opinions, as if we made God the author of all ſin and wickedneſſe, (aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions which we juſtly abhorre &amp; trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at, becauſe they perſwade themſelves that this may be gathered from our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine about God's Praedeſtination and Providence. Wee will not here diſpute whether theſe things be rightly inferred
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:32736:73"/>
yea or no from our ſeverall Tenents and Opinions on both ſides: it ſufficeth, that whatſoever they be, whether juſtly or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly pin'd upon our Opinions, they are denied by us both: nor can we ever be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by any arguments whatſoever, to grant that they are agreeable and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to our Faith. For ſo long as this is done (as indeed it is,) it is manifeſt from what hitherto hath been delivered, that neither can they without injuſtice and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniation bee charged with <hi>Eutychia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,</hi> nor we with thoſe monſtrous and damnable Opinions, although both theſe errours could by true &amp; ſolid conſequence be concluded from our ſeverall Poſitions, (which yet neither ſide will ever confeſſe for their own part.)</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore that all or moſt of thoſe Doctrines which the one ſide taxeth in the other as pernicious and ſuch as cannot conſiſt with Salvation, are but either the private Opinions of ſome particular men or elſe but Corollaries and concluſions vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently wreſted by force of argument out
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:32736:74"/>
of their ſeverall Opinions, would but men (as in reaſon they ought) forbeare to father any thing on either ſide ſave onely that which their whole Churches expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owne and profeſſe for their received O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, it would be very eaſie to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that all the Diſpute and Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie which is in agitation betwixt them, is ſuch as may be tolerated, and that there is not any thing contained in the Faith and Doctrine of either ſide which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe's Salvation.</p>
            <p>Now were but this once agreed upon and beleived on both ſides, there would remaine litle or no difficulty in this whole buſineſſe wherein worthy men doe at this preſent employ themſelves, namely of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Peace and Unity amongſt our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. For ſeeing there are but two waies poſsible of being reconciled; either, that one ſide ſhall renounce their private Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and come over to the other, or elſe, that both ſides ſhall joyne together, retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their ſeverall Opinions, and by a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall condeſcending ſhall each of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:32736:74"/>
that which they diſlike in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Doctrine, eſpecially if it be ſuch as cannot be altered without perill and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to a whole Church; the former of theſe two waies (as we conceive) is not now to be ſtood upon, whereof triall hath been heretofore made not onely without ſucceſſe but with much danger &amp; harme, as appeares ſufficiently from thoſe many Diſputations &amp; Conferences which have been held betwixt both ſides during this whole Age; whereby hatred and &amp; enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath been ingendred rather than extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and the number of Controverſies rather increaſed than diminiſhed. Wee muſt therefore betake our ſelves to that o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther way of being reconciled, and in it muſt we employ all our paines and cares &amp; ſtudies, as being indeed both the only<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie and lawfull way, yea and neceſſary too in our judgement. And that wee may at length attaine unto this, it would not be amiſſe (as we conceive) to proceed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner and method; firſt, wee muſt endeavour that a kinde of Truce and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:32736:75"/>
Ceſſation from our ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ifes &amp; contentions may be agreed upon and enjoyned the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of both ſides, and that they be ſtirred up and exhorted to take this whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe into conſideration: this being obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in the next place ſpeciall diligence muſt be uſed, that after a meeke, freindly, and moſt perſuaſive manner it be made appeare to all, that we are not at variance about any fundamentall Point of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, or ſuch wherein men may not ſafely be of either Opinion without hazarding their ſalvation: and here men muſt be very carefull that they refraine from all intricate Queſtions, and trifling Diſputes, (ſuch wherein the Schoolemen have ſpent ſo much paines, mincing and mangling every thing into I know not how many peices, &amp; then handling every peice ſeverally,) which ſerve for no other end ſave onely to torture &amp; torment mens mindes, but no way make for edification. Would but God be pleaſed ſo farre to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper theſe endeavours as that thus much may be once brought to paſſe, wee make

no doubt but every man would then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily wiſh for this much-deſired Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which none ever ſhunn'd or refuſed but out of a kinde of Religion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, conceiving it unlawfull to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a Communion with any that are not of the ſame beleife and Opinion with themſelves: ſo ſoone as men on both ſides ſhall be wrought off from this ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conceit, they will gladly run and ruſh (as it were) into one anothers armes and embraces. For it cannot be imagined that there is any man, either of the one ſide or the other, ſo ſtupid &amp; void of all reaſon &amp; &amp; Religion, but knows how foul &amp; ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous a thing, how hurtfull to both ſides, how dangerous and pernitious to the whole Chriſtian world this Schiſme is which hath hitherto divided and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted us; on the other ſide, how ſweet, how beneficiall, both to our ſelves &amp; all others, Unity and Peace would be, ſo it might be had without loſſe of Faith and Salvation. And truely the way to ſetle this Unity (were we but once come to that) is plaine
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32736:76"/>
and eaſie. For ſeeing we doe both of us (by God's grace) equally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and beleive the Goſpell of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt penned by his Diſciples; and ſeeing we confeſſe, that whatſoever is of neceſsity for ſalvation to be beleived or done by us, it is all clearely and plainly laid downe in this Goſpell, what hinder's why we may not joyntly confirme and ratify thoſe Articles wherein we both agree? &amp; for thoſe other Points about which wee differ, wee may expreſſe them in ſuch words and phraſes as the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures afford us, and not ſuffer our men to enquire any further, or conteſt about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For if it be true which we both confeſſe, that all thoſe heavenly myſteries which muſt neceſſarily be knowne by us, are clearely revealed in God's word, doubtles then we may content our ſelves with ſo much as the Scripture has delivered, and wee may ſafely forgoe all other Points wherein the Scripture is ſilent. Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Heads of matters in Diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us be laid downe and expreſſed in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:32736:76"/>
a certaine and ſet Forme, ſuch as may give ſatisfaction to both parties, made up wholly (if it be poſsible) of Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>words: and let no man require from his Brother any more beſides it: if any man have attained to a further degree of knowledge, let him keep his knowledge to himſelfe; and let him not deſpiſe the weakneſſe and ſimplicity of others who have not made ſo great a progreſſe in knowledge as himſelfe. As for Rites and Ceremonies wherein the forme of divine worſhip and the Churche's Diſcipline are contained, we conceive it fit that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Church ſhould be left to her owne judgement and liberty herein, and that no innovation be made about ſuch matters.</p>
            <p>Hereafter, if it ſhall pleaſe God, when time ſhall have confirmed and ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this Union, there may be compiled, by the joynt conſent and advice of all, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Liturgy; which would be both a token and bond of Peace. For the preſent, we ſhall think our paines well beſtowed, if at this firſt attempt we can prevaile with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:32736:77"/>
both ſides to tolerate mutually out of Chriſtian Charity ſuch differences of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as are betwixt us either in Doctrine or Diſcipline (which truely are but ſmall, &amp; altogether unworthy to occaſion ſuch a Rupture and Breach betwixt us,) and ſo at length to acknowledge one another to be (as indeed we are) Brethren in the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thus much we thought good to ſpeak in breife touching this matter, that our reverend Brethren, who are well affected to the publike Peace, may underſtand how ready &amp; willing wee are to concurre with them in this pious and Chriſtian worke. And though our meane abilities and the preſent ſtate and condition of our affaires be ſuch, as that wee cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſuch ſervice in it as is meet and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, yet ſhall our earneſt prayers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies accompany the labours and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of thoſe reverend men who are or ſhall be employed therein: and we ſhall account that day moſt happy, wherein we ſhall behold Brethren (having buried all
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:32736:77"/>
ſtrifes and contentions) joyne hands and hearts, and dwell together in the ſame <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi> by this faſt and firme Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, anticipating (as it were) &amp; foreact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here upon earth that everlaſting Unity and Concord which we ſhall hereafter enjoy in Heaven. AMEN.</p>
