         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REFLECTIONS
UPON
A PAPER
INTITULED,
Some REFLECTIONS upon the E. of DANBY,
in relation to the Murder of Sir Edmund-bury Godfrey.</head>
            <head type="sub">In a Letter to a Friend.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Will not ſtay much upon thoſe Reflections in relation
to the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> becauſe I doubt not but God will
clear his Lordſhips Innocencie in due time, to the ſhame
of his Enemies, and to the expoſing thoſe, by whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable
Malice his great Worth and Honour is calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
to the Parliament and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Onely I hope no man can fail in his Obſervation what Sect
of men his Lordſhip is beholding to for their good-wills, who
knew they muſt deſtroy not onely Kings, but ſuch Miniſters as
his Lordſhip, before they can compleat their Bloudy Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
For it is well known, not onely to Me and others who
have had the honour of ſerving that Lord, but even to the worſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103529:2"/>
of his Enemies, who are acquainted with him, (if they will
confeſs Truth) that no man was ever a greater Aſſertor of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (which is the beſt Bulwark againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery)
nor any man more Conſtant both in his own Devotions,
and in the care of ſeeing them duely performed in his Family;
ſo that I do not fear but God will reward him accordingly.</p>
            <p>A little time (when men will but have patience to be truely
informed) will ſerve to wipe off ſuch Scandals from ſo eminent
and ſo good a man: But one ſo inconſiderable as I am, may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
under ſo foul and falſe an Aſperſion, if I ſhould not vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
my ſelf againſt it; beſides that by the falſity of that part
which concerns me, Men will judge of the Truth both of that,
and the reſt of thoſe ſcandalous and falſe Libels which are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd
every day, not onely againſt the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> but
againſt the King himſelf and his Government.</p>
            <p>The Author of that fore-ſaid Libel would have done well,
if he could have concealed his Religion, as well as his Name,
that he might have got ſome little belief in the World: but
although they be workers of darkneſs, I hope their works will
at laſt, all come to light.</p>
            <p>And upon condition that <hi>J. B.</hi> the Author would appear,
and might be hanged in caſe he doth not prove what he ſays
againſt Mr. <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> (whom he ſays took water with Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundbury
Godfrey</hi> at <hi>Whitehall</hi> the day of his being Murthered)
Mr. <hi>Chriſtian</hi> will ſubmit himſelf to that Judgment which <hi>J. B.</hi>
deſerves, if either he, or any man elſe can prove Mr. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
to be within Threeſcore miles of <hi>London</hi> that day; Mr. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
being that very day, the whole day, and night following,
at <hi>Stamford</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> as will be ſufficiently teſtified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>J. B.</hi> deſires in Gods name, that this may be examined;
but he muſt come in the Devils name to prove it: and juſt
ſuch Truths upon Examination will be found, the Earl of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>'s
having had any diſcourſe with Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> in
divers months before his death, and his being at the Lady
<hi>Cokes</hi> Chamber, either at two a clock, or any other time, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I have heard he did go through <hi>Hambden-houſe,</hi> where
the Lady <hi>Coke</hi> then Lodged, about eleven of the clock that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103529:2"/>
day) nor was he ſeen after that hour at the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi>'s
Houſe by any I can hear of, but the Author <hi>J. B.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the ſame truth is the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> ſaid to have
Meetings with Doctor <hi>Tongue</hi> and <hi>Oates</hi> at <hi>Fox-hall;</hi> and yet
<hi>J. B.</hi> draws a great many Concluſions from thoſe things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(as he ſaith) certain; and takes upon him to abuſe the
Houſe of Commons, by ſaying, <hi>This is the true cauſe of their
adhering to their Votes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, that at firſt ſight, I wondred to think how
a man who deſigns like <hi>J. B.</hi> to be thought a good Proteſtant,
and concern'd for the ſafety of the Kingdom, could make this
Relation conſiſt, without blemiſh to the Reputation of Mr. <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Praunce,</hi> and others, by whoſe teſtimony ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
were Condemned and have ſuffered: but before I had read
it half through, his deſign was as plain to deſtroy their
Evidence, and make that paſs for nothing, as it was to blaſt
the Honour and Reputation of the Earl; although he would
fain ſeem to ſay ſomething in their excuſe, by making it worſe,
(viz.) <hi>That we muſt not altogether rely upon what the Evidence
ſay, becauſe a great deal of it is by hear-ſay:</hi> which is to put
a worthy Character upon the Judge and Jury.</p>
            <p>I ſhould believe this <hi>J. B.</hi> to be Author alſo of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Paper, Intituled, <hi>An Anſwer to the Objections againſt the
Earl of</hi> Danby; but (to give him his due) it is too ſilly, and
would be thought to have ſome pitty and good nature in it:
but I am confident, he is the Author of the Print Intituled, <hi>A
perfect Catalogue of all the Lords Treaſurers to this preſent year,
with particular Obſervations on</hi> Thomas <hi>Earl of</hi> Danby, becauſe
of the falſity and Malice it ſpeaks againſt this Earl; and yet
in ſpight of his teeth, he hath ſaid more for him in calling
him <hi>A great Royalliſt,</hi> than he can do for ſome he has endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to commend.</p>
            <p>And as to this Lords Gentility, as it is a great deal more
Antient than he would have it thought, (although he allows it
as long a date, as divers great men, and ſome Lord Treaſurers
can pretend to) ſo his Eſtate when made Lord Treaſurer, was
known to be better than any of the greater number of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103529:3"/>
Lord Treaſurers for one hundred years before him have brought
into the Kings Service; although many of them have left their
Places with much greater Eſtates than he hath done.</p>
            <p>As wickedneſs is ever put under the diſguiſe of Religion
and Piety, ſo <hi>J. B.</hi> ends his Paper with very good Prayers
and Thoughts, which I fear are leaſt in his heart, <hi>(viz) That
none will eſcape from Gods vengeance, but ſuch as from their
Souls love Truth, and preſerve their hearts from Malice, and
hands from ſeeking Innocent Blood.</hi> Whatever <hi>J. B.</hi> thinks, I
am intirely of that opinion: and that both he and they may
Repent, and turn to the Truth, is the Prayer of</p>
