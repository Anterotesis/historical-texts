            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A REPLY TO A Paper Intituled: An Anſwer to the Pretended <hi>CASE</hi> Printed concerning the Navigation of the River <hi>WYE,</hi> in the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> by ſhewing the true ſtate thereof.</head>
            <p>THe Deſign of making the River <hi>Wye</hi> Navigable, was in Propoſition many Years before the Undertaking thereof. For <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle of <hi>Arundel</hi> (Grandfather to the now Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>) Diſcourſt with the Gentlemen of <hi>Suſſex</hi> and <hi>Surry,</hi> how to make a Navigable Cut from <hi>Arundel</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> to the <hi>Thames</hi> by the River <hi>Wye,</hi> about 50 Years agone, and took a Survey of that Paſſage; But the greatneſs of the Charge and difficulty of the Work deterred him. About the Year 1625. Doctor <hi>Abbat</hi> (Lord Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) being Born at <hi>Guilford</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> and deſirous for the Benefit of the Town, to have a River made; cauſed a Survey to be taken, but Charge and Difficulty diſcouraged him alſo, ſo that his Grace beſtowed that intended Charity, in Building an Hoſpital in that Town.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Pitſon</hi> having obſerved in <hi>Holland,</hi> the Advantage and Art of Navigable Cuts, and being Diſcourſt by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Guilford</hi> (near whereunto he dwelt) concerning the Navigation of River <hi>Wye,</hi> aſſured them the thing was Feaſible; whereupon they Requeſted him to undertake it, and Procured an Act of the then Pretended Parliament for the doing thereof, which he did. And the Work being too great for <hi>Guilford</hi> to go through with, they Aſſigned their Power by the ſaid Pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Act, to <hi>Pitſon, Scotcher, How</hi> and <hi>Waltham. How</hi> and <hi>Waltham</hi> Releas'd to <hi>Pitſon</hi> and <hi>Scotcher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Richard Weſton</hi> was under Sequeſtration, by Sir <hi>Richard Ouſlow,</hi> and other the Commiſſioners as a Delinquent, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſant, upon Suppoſition that he had been in Arms at <hi>Hereford,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Pitſon</hi> ſatisfied the then Powers was not true, and ſo helpt him off his Sequeſtration for Pretended Delinquency.</p>
            <p>After which Sir <hi>Richard Weſton</hi> proffering for 6000. l. to perform the Work, it was Agreed he ſhould have half the Profit for his Charges, and they furniſh the other 3000. l. and took a Mortgage of the Mannor of <hi>Sutton</hi> for Security of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, but he failing ſold his Moyty to <hi>Pitſon</hi> and others, for 3100. l. more. And before the River was made Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Pitſon</hi> laid out above 10000. l. and Sir <hi>Richard Weſton</hi> was Reimburſt every Farthing he could pretend to have laid out. And though a Son of Sir <hi>Richard Weſtons,</hi> undertook to proceed upon his Fathers beginnings, yet he alſo Failed, and <hi>Pitſon</hi> finiſht the Cut in 1653. as is clearly proved in the Court of Exchequer. But whereas that Paper ſays, that it is in Proof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Barons, that <hi>Pitſon</hi> in 1654. had Received above 2000. l. more then his Disburſments; 'tis ſo far from being True, that nothing like it has been offered in Proof there, and the Records themſelves will beſt decide this Controverſie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pitſon</hi> and his Partners had Poſſeſſion of the River till 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>62. when one <hi>Dickenſon</hi> a Solliciter finding that part of the Lands Cut through was the Kings Waſte, and that ſome Land-Owners who had been agreed withal, and received part (but not all) their Moneys, had not conveyed their Lands to <hi>Pitſon,</hi> took Avantage thereof in 1662. And got a Leaſe of ſome Lands from Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees under the Queen, and of others from the Land-owners unſatisfied, and ſtopt the Navigation; though divers Orders of the King and Council, and Annimadverſions of the Court of Exchequer, have ſeverally reproved Mr. <hi>Dickenſons</hi> troubleſome and unreſonable Carriage in this Affairs: Yet in hopes to weary <hi>Pitſon</hi> and all others not Trucking with him, he has continued this Diſturbance, that he may ſecurely Fiſh in troubled Waters, and what ever becomes of the Client, the Soliciter being the common Truſtee will be a gainer. But becauſe the ſaid Paper pretends Matters on <hi>Dickenſons</hi> part to be ſo clearly proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Barrons, it is humbly deſired that by what has and ſhall appear in the ſaid Court of Exchequer, to be true in Proof, every mans Intereſt may ſtand or fall.</p>
            <p>The matter depended long in the Court of <hi>Exchequor</hi> becauſe Mr. <hi>Dickenſon</hi> uſed all the ſubterfuge and evaſions imaginable to delay the Proceedings, and ſhifted the Intreſts by ſo many Conveyances Leaſes and Aſſignments Pendent like to amuſe the Cauſe, that had not that Court been extraordinary induſtrious as well as juſt, <hi>Pitſon</hi> and <hi>Sands, &amp;c.</hi> the Cauſe had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard to this day, which has been <hi>Dickenſons</hi> continual endeavour.</p>
