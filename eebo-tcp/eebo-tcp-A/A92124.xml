         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath pleaſed God ſtill to bleſſe
our endeavours above expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
all the glorie be given to God.
We have taken in Tiverton, both
the Towne, Caſtle, Church, and
Fort, a place of ſo great ſtrength, that had not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113262:3"/>
the Lord done wonderfully for us, wee might
rather have admired their ſtrength, than expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to be Maſters of it; the manner wherof,
together with other paſſages ſince my laſt, I
have here enformed you, ſince our advance
from Chard untill this preſent. We advanced
on Tueſday the 14 of October inſtant from
Chard, and marched to Honniton; and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
horſe (through the careleſneſſe of ſome of
our Guards) fell upon our out-quarters, and
tooke ſome fortie Dragoones and Foot, and
thoſe horſe of Gorings returned preſently to
their quarters about Exeter; wee quartered
that night, and all Wedneſday, and Wedneſday
night about Honniton, and met with ſome of
Gorings ſtraglers and others, we have (divers)
come in to us, and on Wedneſday the 15. of
October inſtant, we advanced from Hunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
and marched that day to Columbton,
where the Lord Miller was quartered with
two Regiments of Horſe and one of Dragoons,
the towne being ſlightly fortified: but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
upon our advance, they quitted that
place and fled; We had then intelligence, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113262:3"/>
Greenvill was with about two thouſand foot
that day viz. Wedneſday Octob. 15. inſtant at
Bow, and it was ſuppoſed that the next day he
would be in conjunction with Goring, moſt
part of his Horſes then quartered in the villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
on this ſide of Exeter, about Cliffe, Silver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
Stoake, Rew, Huckſham, and all the
Pariſhes thereabouts; The Foot (which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
did belong to Gerhards Brigade of old)
then quartered moſt of them at Broadcliffe. On
Thurſday Octob. 16. inſtant, Major-Generall
Maſſey was ordered to advance to Tiverton,
and ſo to quarted beyond the River with his
Brigade, and there was the good effect of that
took in the enemies Quarters, and Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Maſſey did ſoone poſſeſſe himſelfe of
the Town of Tiverton, the Enemie marched
away, onely thoſe who were left in the Caſtle,
and the Church, to keep thoſe places. It was
then conceived hard for us, nay almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for us to hinder the Enemies Horſe from
marching Eaſtward, if he do attempt it with
the whole ſtrength, except Lievtenant-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Cromwell (with his whole Brigade) come
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113262:4"/>
up to us; And that day wee began to extend
our quarters towards Broadminch, and ſo nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to Exeter.</p>
            <p>On Friday the 17. inſtant, our Generall Sir
Thomas Fairfax ſate downe before Tiverton-Caſtle
and Church, to take them in, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
the enemy to deliver them up, of which
being denied, we planted our batteries againſt
them, which went forwards that day and the
next.</p>
            <p>On Saturday Octob. 18. inſtant, our batteries
were finiſhed by the afternoone, and on this
day being the Lords day Octob. 19. inſtant, the
Generall cauſed ſeverall great pieces to be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on the batteries againſt the Caſtle verie ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſo that they were ready to play by breake of
day, and all our Cannon began to play about
ſeven a clocke in the morning, againſt the
Caſtle, and the Enemie from thence an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
us with their pieces, but did no exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
upon us.</p>
            <p>And after many ſhot that we had made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, a Cannonier by one ſhot gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
performed this buſineſſe, for he broke the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113262:4"/>
chaine of the Draw-bridge with a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
which paſſeth over to the entrance
of the Caſtle, which falling downe, the
chaine being ſo broken, our Souldiers
fell on without any further order from
the Generall, they being loth to loſe
ſuch an opportunitie, and loving rather
to fight than to look on when God gives
them ſuch occaſion, which took good
effect, for they ſoone poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of all; they preſently entred the
Caſtle and Church, in which wee had
foure men ſlaine: yet ſuch is the mild
and gentle carriage of the Generall, and
his deſire to ſpare the effuſion of bloud,
as much as may be, that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
they took it by ſtorme, yet he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
gave command, that quarter ſhould
be given to all thoſe who were alive:
wee took in the caſtle Sir <hi>Gilbert Talbot</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:113262:5"/>
who was Governour of the place, 20 o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Officers, 200 Souldiers, four peece
of Ordnance, good ſtore of Armes
and Ammunition, and abundance of
treaſure, which was divided amongſt
the Souldiers. The caſtle was verie
ſtrong, and the works all regular. The
Generall intends to march on Munday
for the releefe of Plymouth, and wee
heare that Lievtenant-Generall <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>

as the laſt night, and cometh on verie
