            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE BEVVTIFVLL LIGHT of the Goſpell (moſte vvorthy Prince) hath novve ſo manye yeares shyned, that not vnvvorthily, if it ſo had ſeemed good to God, it might haue dravvne all men to the loue and eſtimation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, &amp; aſſvvaged the malice of the chiefeſt enimies, in ſuche ſort, as thoughe they could not find in their hearts to embrace it, yet at the leaſtvvyſe they shoulde forbeare from their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable ſlaunders and cruell raylings. But bicauſe they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe beleeue (as vve reade in the Actes of the Apoſtles) that are before appoynted to ſaluation: So farre of are our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from vvaxing more gentle, or any vvhitte forſaking their crueltie and reprochfull vvordes, as novv at length they poure out more boldely and diſpitefully the vileſt vvordes they can, not onely agaynſt the poore Preachers, but alſo agaynſt theyr doctrine, and the very Goſpell it ſelfe. For of late came there one abrode, (vvhoſe name I vvill not here declare) vvho taking occaſion of theſe laſt vvarres, vvith a foolish and ſlaunderous booke, cuttes in peeces, teares, chides, and vvith as yll reportes as may be, burdeneth as vvell the Princes, as ſubiectes, that bee fauorers of the Goſpell, and herevvithall (full vviſely) calles vs againe to Poperie, tearming vs Apoſtatas, and forſakers of our fayth. But ſurely he deſerueth no aunſvvere, as one that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept raylinges hath vttered nothing: and his Booke that hee vvrote, ſeemes to be vvritten by a man ouerſeene vvith vvine, hauing no Methode therein, but a certaine diſordered heape of vvordes, and (as they ſay) a tale vvithout a head. Yet vvoulde
<pb facs="tcp:9789:4"/>
I there should be ſome that should aunſvvere this ſlaunderer, not for his ſake, but for the vvorthineſſe of the religion that vve profeſſe: vvhereby hee might perceyue vvith vvhat rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vngodlineſſe, and malepartneſſe he controlles and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes the thing he doth not vnderſtande. For although vve are bound by the vvorde of God, to beare and diſſemble the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and offences that are done vnto vs: yet ſuch things as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto truth, the pure doctrine of the Goſpell, and ſo to the honour and glorie of God, vve ought by no meanes to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but earneſtly both vvith vvordes and vvritings to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the enimies, as vvith great commendation did the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Doctors of the Churche, agaynſt the Heathen, and firſt planters of Heriſies: for theſe ſlaunderers, although of ſuch as ſufficiently knovve the truth, they be but laught at and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed, yet doe they infect, and not a little abuſe the vveake, and cauſe them to miſtruſt and think the vvorse of the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vve teach. Therefore eyther for the Doctrine it ſelfe, or elſe for the vveakelinges that haue but nevvly begonne to taſte the truth, the vvickedneſſe and malice of this defamer, in calling the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell that vve preach Turkish, and by other hatefull tearmes, is to be beaten dovvne and vtterly confuted. And here I can not but vvoonder vvith vvhat face hee can thus shameleſly behaue himſelfe, ſince it is vvell knovvn he neuer reade any booke of ours, vvhereby hee might rightly iudge of our fayth and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, neyther is it reaſon for the fault and offence of ſome one Prince or ſubiect to giue iudgement vpon all. But I thinke he learned theſe ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, at the Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of ſome bavvling Friers, or other venimous Papiſtes, vvho haue more care for their bellies, than for the truth, vvherby he thought to be accounted a great Clearke, for thundering out his rayling Rethoricke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt vs, and thinkes it no little glorie, if vvith his fonde and ruffianly booke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, he may not ouerthrovv (for ſo great his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not: and if it vvere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the truth is inuincible) but like a flie
<pb facs="tcp:9789:4"/>
or a gnat, ſting and bite vs, vvhome it pleaſeth him to call Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans. But I truſt there shall ſome man bee founde that shall aunſvvere the foole, as Salomon ſayth, according to his follye, leaſt he should ſeeme vviſe to himſelfe. I for my part, as vvell as leyſure vvoulde preſently ſerue, haue plainely and truely ſet forth the chiefe members of the Popish ſtate, their fayth, their cerimonies, and religion, though I paſſe ouer names: that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man may ſee, vvhether they or vve come nearer to the ſteps of the Apoſtles, and vvhether they be Catholikes, or rather vve vvhom they ſo hate and perſecute as Heritikes. VVhat good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vvhat true dealing, or vvhat thing agreeing vvith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike doctrine there is among theſe Papiſtes, I truelye can not ſee. On the other ſide it plaine appeareth, that our religion is ſuch, as the Papiſtes vvith all their indeuor, by faythfull vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Scriptures, yet hitherto coulde neuer bee able to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throvv. VVhither than do they call vs? Doe they thinke that vve vvill forſake the truth, and follovve falshoode in ſo cleare a light? VVhy doe they call vs Apoſtatas? Is it a shame to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake vngodlineſſe and Idolatrie, and other thinges both vaine and foolish? That this religion of theirs is none other, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende ſo brieflye to shovve, that it maye appeare as in a Table, vvhereby our men maye pacientlier beare the iniuryes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches of theſe fellovves, in ſeeing from vvhat monſters by the doctrine of the Goſpell they are deliuered, and our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaryes not beare their heades ſo loftie, and boaſt themſelues to bee the true Church of Chriſt, beholding the abuſes aſvvell of their life, as of their religion, diſcloſed &amp; declared vnto all men. I therefore exhort our brethren, that they eſteeme as their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt glorie, the departing from the Pope, and as a ſinguler bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of GOD, the knovvledge of the Goſpell. I exhort al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo and admonishe our aduerſaries, that they leaue of in time fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſlaundering, not onely vs (vvho in reſpect are nothing) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the truth of God, and the Goſpell of Chriſt, and that they
<pb facs="tcp:9789:5"/>
vveigh the matter vvith more diligence, and remooue a vvhile from their eyes the conſent of numbers of people, the auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Pope and his members, and the accuſtomed religion of a fevv hundred yeares: for theſe and ſuch other like are of no force in the confirming of truth, but are rather lettes and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraunces to the knovvledge thereof, and common to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes of the vvhole vvorlde, vvho by antiquitie, continuaunce, aucthoritie of Kinges and Princes, and the generall conſent of people, are able to defende their ſuperſticious lavves. But other groundes of fayth and religion ought Chriſtians to haue, as the conſent of the Prophetes, and the Apoſtles, the authoritie of the holy Ghoſt, bearing vvitneſſe of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, as vvell in ſcriptures, as in the heartes of men. Theſe if they thorovvlye conſider, and vvithout parcialitie regarde, I doubt not but it shall come to paſſe, that clothing themſelues vvith Chriſtian shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe, they shall amende and returne vnto more ſounder and ſurer doctrine. A great foolishneſſe it is to knovve vvhat is beſt, and to follovve the vvorſt, as many of our aduerſaryes for gaine, and their bellies ſake do. In the meane time, moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Prince, great cauſe vve haue to reioyce of our ſelues, beholding in hovve great darkeneſſe, errors, deceyts, and vanities, our enimies vvalke: and to beſech God, that it may pleaſe him, to open their eyes and their mindes, that they may beholde the light of the Goſpell, by vvhich the quietneſſe of heart is onely obtayned, and that they may ſeeke for and enioy al things in Chriſt our alonely ſauiour. Hovve great a griefe it is to ſuch as trauaile to bee ignoraunt of their vvay, or taught amiſſe by ſome malicious guide, they vvell can tell that haue had experience thereof. Neyther doth it anye vvhit auaile to proue many vvayes, and yet to bee farre of from the right. VVhich commonly happeneth, as is vvell knovvne, to our enimies. For many vvayes they attempt, and trie, and carefully vvrest their mind hither and thither, to obtaine the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of their ſinnes, and euerlaſting life. But euery man that
<pb facs="tcp:9789:5"/>
is Godly doth ſee, that they ſtriue and trauaile in vaine, vvhen the only vvay vnto God is Chriſt,<note place="margin">Iohn. 14.</note> vvho is made vnto vs of God the father, vviſdome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification,<note place="margin">1.

This vvay bicauſe it is plaine, and not gainefull, the blinde and vvicked guides doe eyther craftily shunne, and leade men into thickets, or vvilderneſſes, vvhence they neuer can get out, or carie the poore creatures to craggie rocks, and breake neck mountaines. Beſides vve ought to account it no ſmall benifite of God, that vvee are deliuered from theſe fellovves, and that vvee vnderſtand their deuiſes and deceytes, vvhereby vve may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually bevvare of them. For this onely intent, haue I taken this vvorke in hand, that the truth and the brightneſſe of the Goſpell may the better shine out, by ſetting forth the contrary deuiſes, vvorspippings, ceremonies, and life of the Papiſtes, that euery man may take heede of theſe, and more earneſtly receyue, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, and vvith all their endeuor keepe and defende the other. And to you (moſt vvorthie prince) haue I dedicated this vvork for many reſpects, all vvhich to rehearſe vvere nedeleſſe. Your ſinguler and gracious fauour tovvards me, and liberalitie vvell beſeeming a prince deſerueth ſome greater matter, and more meete for your highneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I knovv your grace is alvvayes vvoont more to eſteeme the minde of the giuer, than the gift: neyther did I minde to giue your grace this, as a recompence for your goodneſſe tovvardes me, (for that am I neuer able to doe) but onely to declare my ſelfe, not vnmindefull of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifites. Moreouer, I thought it good to giue this booke vnto you as meeteſt before all other Princes, for your great and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler trauaile in ſetting forth of the Goſpell, for the daungers and miſeries that you haue ſuſtained in defending of it, vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in euen to captiuitie, and the great hazarde of your lyfe (from the vvhich I thanke God, and vvith all my heart reioyce, that
<pb facs="tcp:9789:6"/>
you are at the length deliuered, and reſtored to the ſeat of your Progenitors) moſt valiantly ye haue ſtriuen: and alſo for the vvonderfull and Princely courage of your heart, in ſo many, ſo great and grieuous temptations, and conſtancie in keeping it. You shall here beholde vvhat things they bee (although you vvere not before ignoraunt of them) vnto the vvhich, though by ſundrie deuyſes aſſaulted, you coulde by no meanes bee brought. And on the other ſide aparantly, vvhat maner of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it is that you furthered, hitherto defended, and by the mightie helpe of God retayned. Certaine there be that are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere and vnmoueable in keeping their fayth heretofore deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered them, as the Turkes, the Ievves, and ſuch others, but ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon no certaine ground, nor aucthoriſed by the vvitneſſe of any holy ſcriptures, but only by the inuentions and dreames of men. But ſuch conſtancie (or if I may ſo ſay) obſtinacy, is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, that hath hir foundation vpon Gods vvord: and can by no meanes bee dravvne or forced to error and vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for the vvhich the vvitneſſes of Chriſt haue alvvaies bene vvorthily prayſed. Therefore bicauſe I thought this little work vvould not be altogither vnpleaſaunt vnto you, I preſumed to dedicate it vnto your highneſſe, moſt humblie beſeeching you to beare vvith the ſimpleneſſe thereof, and to accept herein my vvell meaning minde, and to receyue me into your graces protection, vvhoſe long proſperitie, vvith the happie ſucceſſe of your moſt noble and renovvmed children, I earneſtly deſire God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue. </p>

This ſurely is the ſtedfaſtnes of the knovvne &amp; aſſertaine truth, from vvhich in theſe dayes (the more pittie) haue great numbers vvithdravvne theirſelues, eyther for feare, or hope of liuing &amp; revvard, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvhich can nothing be more vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, nor of more force to the eſtablishing of vngodlineſſe.
