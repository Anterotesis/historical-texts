            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Did not intend to trouble your Lordship twice with this Contention between me and Doctor <hi>Wallis.</hi> But your Lordship sees how I am constrained to it; which (whatsoever reply the Doctor makes) I shall be constrained to no more. That which I have now said of his Geometry, Manners, Divinity, and G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ammar all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether is not much, though enough. As for that which I here have written concerning his Geometry, which you will look for first, is so clear, that not only your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and such as have proceeded far in that Sicence, but also any man else that doth but know how to adde and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract Proportions (which is taught at the twentieth third Proposition of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The rest (which concerneth Grammar) is almost all another mans, but so full of Learning of that kinde, as no man that taketh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in knowing the proprieties of the Greek and Latine Tongues, will think his time ill bestowed in the reading

Your Lordship may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps say my Complement in my Tittle page is somewhat course; And 'tis true. But, my Lord, it is since the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Title page, that I am returned from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors manners to my own; which are such as I hope you will not be ashamed to own me, my Lord, for one of</hi>

            <p>That is, if there be propounded a row of quantities in duplicate proportion of the quantities Arithmetically proportional (or proceeding in the order of the square num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers) continually increasing; and beginning at a point or 0; let it be propounded to finde what proportion the row hath; to as many quantities equal to the greatest;</p>
            <p>Let it be sought by induction (as in the first proposition)</p>
            <p>The proportion arising is every where greater then subtriple, or ⅓, And the excesse perpetually decreaseth as the number of termes is augmented, as here, 1/6 1/12 1/18 1/24 1/30 &amp;c. the denominator of the fraction being in every place augmented by the number six (as is manifest) so that the excesse of the rising proportion above subtriple is the same which unity hath to six times the number of termes after 0; and so.</p>
            <p>Sir, In these your Characters I understand by the crosse + that the quantities on each side of it are to be added together and make one Aggregate; and I understand by the two parallel lines = that the quantities betwen which they are placed are one to another equall; This is your meaning, or you should have told us what you meant else: I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand also, that in the first row 0 + 1 is equal to 1, and 1 + 1 equal to 2; And that in the second row 0 + 1 + 4 is equal to 5; and 4 + 4 + 4 equal to 12; But (which you are too apt to grant) I understand your Symboles no further; but must confer with your self about the rest.</p>
            <p>And first I ask you (because fractions are commonly written in that manner) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the uppermost row (which is <gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>) 0/1 be a fraction, 1/1 be a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44957:4"/>
½ be a fraction, that is to say, a part of an unite, and if you will (for the cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers sake) whether 0/1, be an infinitely little part of 1; and whether 1/1, or 1 divided by 1 signifie an unity; if that be your meaning, then the fractio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 0/1 added to the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction 1/1 is equal to the fraction ½: But the fraction 0/1 is equal to 0; therefore the fraction 0/1 + 1/1 is equal to the fraction 1/1; and 1/1 equal to ½ which you will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confesse to be an absurd conclusion, and cannot own that meaning.</p>
            <p>I ask you therefore again if by 0/1 you mean the proportion of 0 to 1; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by 1/1 the proportion of 1 to 1, and by ½ the proportion of 1 to 2: if so, then it will follow, that if the proportions of 0 to 1 and of 1 to 1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e compounded by addition, the proportion arising will be the proportion of 1 to 2. But the proportion of 0 to 1 is infinitely little, that is, none. Therefore the proportion arising by composition will be that of 1, to 1, and equall (because of the symbol =) to the proportion of 1 to 2 and so 1 = 2: This also is so absurd that I dare say that you will not own it.</p>
            <p>There may be another meaning yet: perhaps you mean that the uppermost quantitie 0 + 1 is equal to the uppermost q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>antity 1; and the lowermost quantity 1 + 1 equal to the lowermost quantity 2: Which is true: but how then in this equation ½ = ⅓ + ⅙ is the uppermost quantity 1 equal to the uppermost quantity 1 + 1; or the lower most quantity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> equal to the lowermost quantity 3 + 6? Therefore neither can this be your meaning; unlesse you make your symbols more significant, you must not blame me for want of understanding them.</p>
            <p>Let us now try what better successe we s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>all have where the places are three, as here <gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>: If your Symbols be fractions, the compound of them by addition is 5/4; For 0, ¼ and 4/4 make 5/4; and consequently (because of the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole =) 5/4 equal to 5/12 which is not to be allowed, and therefore that was not your meaning. If you meant that the proportions of 0 to 4 &amp; of 1 to 4 &amp; of 4 to 4 compounded is equal to the proportion of 5. to 12. you will fall again into no less an inconvenience. For the proportion arising out of that Composition will be the proportion of 1. to 4. For the proportion of 0. to 4. is infinitely little. Then to compound the other two, set them in this order 1. 4. 4. and you have a proportion compounded of 1. to 4. and of 4. to 4. namely, the proportion of the first to the last, which is of 1. to 4. which must be equal (by this your meaning) to the proportion of 5. to 12. and consequently as 5. to 12. so is 1. to 4. which you must not own. Lastly, if you mean that the uppermost quantities to the uppermost, and the lowermost to the lowermost in the first Equation are equal, tis granted, but then again in the second Equation it is false. It concerns your fame in the Mathematicks to look about how to justifie these Equations which are the premises to your conclusion following, namely, that the proportion arising is every where greater then subtriple, or a third; and that the excess (that is, the excess above subtriple) perpetually decreaseth as the number of terms is augmented, as here
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44957:5"/>
1/6 1/12 1/18 1/24 1/30 &amp;c. which I will shew you plainly is false.</p>
            <p>But first I wonder why you were so angry with me for saying you made proportion to consist in the Quotient, as to tell me it was abominably false, and to justifie it, cite your own words <hi>Penes Quotientem,</hi> do not you say here, the proportion is every where greater then subtriple, or ⅓? And is not ⅓ the quotient of 1. divided by 3? You cannot say in this place that <hi>Penes</hi> is understood; for if it were expressed you would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot be able to proceed.</p>
            <p>But I return to your conclusion, that the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ess of the proportion of the increasing quantities above the third part of so many t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mes the greatest, decreaseth as 1/6 1/12 1/18 1/24 1/30 &amp;c. For by this accompt in this row <gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap> where the quantitie above exceeds the third part of the quantities below by ⅓' you make ⅓ equal to ⅙' whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h you do not mean. It may be said your meaning is that the proportion of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triple of 2. which is ⅔ exceedeth what? I cannot imagine what, nor proceed further where the ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s be but two. Let us therefore take the second row, that is, <gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap> The summe above is 5. the summe below is 12. the third part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is 4. if you mean, that the proportion of 5. to 4. exceeds the proportion of 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to 12. (which is subtriple) by 1/12' you are out again. For 5. exceeds 4. by unitie, which is 12/12 I do not think you will own such an equation as <gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Therefore I believe you mean (and your next proposition assures me of it) that the proportion of 5. to 4. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds subtriple proportion by the proportion of 1. to 12. if you do so, you are yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>For if the proportion of 5. to 4. exceeds subtriple proportion by the proportion of 1. to 12. then subtriple proportion, that is, of 4. to 12. added to the proportion of 1. to 12. must make the proportion of 5. to 4. But if you look on these quantities 4. 12. 144. you will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee and must not dissemble that the proportion of 4. to 12. is subtriple, and the proportion of 12. to 144. is the same with that of 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to 12. Therefore by your asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it must be as 5. to 4. so 4. to 144. which you must not own.</p>
            <p>And yet this is manifestly your meaning as apppeareth in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Be it sought by way of induction, (as in prop. 1. 19).</p>
            <p>The proportion arising is every where greater then subquadruple, or ¼, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse perpetually decreaseth as the number of tearms increaseth as ¼, ⅛, 1/12, 1/16, 1/20, &amp;c. The denominator of the fraction, or consequent of the proportion being in every place augmented by the number 4 (as is manifest) so that the excesse of the arising proportion above subquadruple is the same with that which an unite hath to the quadruple of the number of the tearms after 0. And so. Here are just the same faults which are in prop. 19.</p>
            <p>For if 0/1 be a fraction, and 1/1 be a fraction and ½ be another fraction, then this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation <gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap> is false. For this fraction 0/1 is equal, to 0<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore we have 1/1 = ½, that is the whole equal to half. But perhaps you do not mean them fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but proportions; and consequently that the proportion of 0 to 1, and of 1 to 1 compounded by addition (I say by addition; not that I, but that you think there is a composition of proportions by multiplication, which I shall shew you anon is f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lse) must be equal to the proportion of 1 to 2. which cannot be, For the proportion of 0 to 1 is infinitely little, that is, none at all; and consequently the proportion of 1 to 1 is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to the proportion of 1 to 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is again absurd, There is no doubt, but the whole number of 0 + 1 is equal to 1, and the whole number 1 + 1 equal to 2. But reckoning them as you do, not for whole numbers, but for fractions, or proportions, the equations are false.</p>
            <p>Again your second equation 2/4 =  ¼ + ¼ though meant of fractions, that is of quotients it be true, and serve nothing to your purpose, yet if it be meant of proportions, it is false. For the proportion of 1 to 4 and of 1 to 4 being compounded are equal to the proportion of 1 to 16, and so you make the proportion of 2 to 4 equal to the proportion of 1 to 16, where as it is but subquaduplicate, as you call it, or the quarter of it as I call it. And in the same manner you may demonstrate to yourself, the same fault in all the other rows of how many tearms soever they consist, Therefore you may give for lost this 39. prop. as well as all the other 38 that went before.

            <p>That is; If a row of quantlties be propounded in triplicate proportion of Arithmeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally proportionalls (or according to the row of cubick numbers) continually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing; and beginning at a point or 0; The proportion which that row <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Or which the cubick root of the first term after 0 hath to the quadruple of the root of the greatest tearm.</p>
            <p>It is manifest by the precedent propositions.</p>
            <p>And seeing, the number of tearmes increasing, that excesse above quadruple propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth so continually decrease, as that at length it becomes lesse then any proportion that can be assigned (as is manifest) if the proceeding be infinite, it shall quite vanish; And so.</p>
            <p>This conclusion was annexed to the end of your 39 proposition; as there prooved. What cause you had to make a new proposition of it, without other proof then <hi>pate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ex praecedente,</hi> I cannot imagine. But howsoever the proposition is false.</p>
            <p>For example, set forth any of your rowes, as this of fower termes.

            <p>The row above is 36<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the fourth part of the row below is 27. The quadruple of the number of termes after 0 is 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then by your accompt, the proportion of 36 to 108 is greater then subquadruple proportion by the proportion of 1 to 12. For trial where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of set in order these three quantities 36. 27. 108. The proportion of 36 (the uppermost row) to 108 (the lowermost row) is compounded by addition of the proportion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 36 to 27, and 27 to 108. And the proportion of 36 to 108 exceedeth the proportion of 27 to 108 by the proportion of 36 to 27. But the proportion of 27 to 108 is subquadruple proportion. Therefore the proportion of 36 to 108 exceedeth subquadruple proportion, by the proportion of 36 to 27. And by your account by the proportion of 1 to 12; and consequently as 36 to 27 so is 1 to 12. Did you think such demonstrations as these, should alwayes passe?</p>
            <p>Then for your inference from the decrease of the proportions of the excesse to the vanishing of the excesse it self, I have already shewed it to be false; and by consequence that your next Proposition, namely, the 40 is also false.</p>
            <p>The proposition is this.</p>

Manifest out of the precedent proposition.</p>
            <p>Even as manifest as that 36. 27. 1. 12. Are proportionalls: seeing therefore your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the spiral lines and spaces is given by your self for lost, and a vaine attempt, your first 41 propositions are undemonstrated, and the grounds of your demonstrations all false. The cause whereof is partly your taking quotient for proportion, and a point for 0, as you do in the 1. 16 and 40. propositions and in other places where you say <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at a point or</hi> 0; though now you denie you ever said either.

            <p>Your 42 proportion is grounded on the 40; and therefore though true, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated by others, is not demonstrated by you.</p>
            <p>Your 43 is this.</p>

            <p>But by the same method that I have demonstrated that the 19. 20. 21. 39. 40. 41.

            <p>I have one thing more to adde, and that is the disaffection I am charged with all to the Universities.

On the other side, in case the same means and the same wits should be imployed in the advancing of the Doctrines that tend to the weakning of the publick, and strengthning of the power of any private ambitious party, they would also be very effectual for that; And consequently that if any Doctri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> might afterwards be reduced to the single terme of <hi>Empusa.</hi> Nor do I much doubt, but that those who are conversant in Languages, and know how that several expressions are often jumbled together to make up one word upon such like cases, will think this a probable origination. I beleeve then that Mr. <hi>Hobbes's</hi> friend did never tell him it was in <hi>Eustathius,</hi> or that <hi>Empusa</hi> was an <hi>hopping phantasme.</hi> It had two legges, and went upon both, as a man may upon a wooden legge. <gap reason="foreign">

But Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> did not except against the derivation (although he might justly, derivations made afterwards carrying more of fancy then of truth, and the Dr. is not excused for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting what others barely relate, none approve) but asked him, where that is, in what Authors <hi>he read that boyes play to be so called.</hi> To which question the Dr. (to shew his read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the good Authors he is conversant in) replies, <hi>In Junius's Nemenclator, Rider and Thomas's Dictionary, sufficient Authors in such a businesss,</hi> which me thinks no man should say that were neer to so copious a Library. It is to be remembred that the trial now is in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> School, &amp; amongst <hi>Ciceronians,</hi> neither whereof wil allow those to be sufficient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of any Latine word. Alas they are but <hi>Vocabularies;</hi> and if they bring no Author for their allegation, all that may be allowed them is, that by way of allusion our modern play may be called <hi>Ludus Empusae.</hi> But that it is so called, we must expect till some Author do give it the name. These are so good Authors that I have not either of them in my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary. But I have taken the paines to consult, first <hi>Rider;</hi> I looked in him (who was onely Author of the English Dictionary) and I could not finde any such thing. Tis true in the <hi>Latine</hi> Dictionary which is joyned with <hi>Rider,</hi> but made by <hi>Holyoke;</hi> (O that the Doctor would but mark!) in the Index of obsolete words, there is <hi>Ascoliasmus, Ludus Empusae, Fox to thy hole,</hi> for which word, not signification, he quoteth <hi>Junius.</hi> The same is in <hi>Yho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masius,</hi> who refers to <hi>Junius</hi> in like manner. But could the Dr. think the word obsolete when the play is still in fashion? Or doth he think that this play is so ancient, as to have had a name so long ago, that it should now be grown obsolete? As for <hi>Junius's</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of <hi>Empusa,</hi> it is this, <hi>Empusa, spectrum quod se in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But to illustrate this controversie further, I cannot be perswaded the Dr. ever looked into <hi>Junius,</hi> for if he had, I am confident, according to his wonted accuratnesse, he would have cited <hi>Polluxs's onomasticon</hi> into the bargin, for <hi>Junius</hi> refers to him, and I shall set down his words, that so the Reader may see what <hi>Ascoliasmus</hi> was, and all the Drs.

               </gap>. <q>So that <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coliasmus,</hi> and consequently, <hi>Ludus Empusae,</hi> was a certain sport which consisted in hopping, whether it were by striving who could hoppe surthest, or whether onely one did pursue the rest hopping, and they fled before him on both leggs, which game he was to continue till he had caught one of his fellows, or whether it did consist in the boyes striving who could hop longest. Or lastly, whether it did consist in hopping upon a certain bladder, which being blown up, and well oyled over, was placed upon the ground for them to hop upon, that so the unctuous bladder might slip from under them and give them a fall.</q> And this is all that <hi>Pollux</hi> holds forth. Now of all these wayes there is none that hath any resemblance with our, <hi>Fox to thy hole;</hi> but the second: and yet in its description there is no mention of beating him with gloves, as they do now adayes, and wherein the play consists as well as in hopping. It might not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding be called <hi>Ludus Empusae,</hi> but not in any sort our <hi>Fox to thy hole,</hi> So that the Dr. and his Authors are out; imposing that upon <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> which they never said.
