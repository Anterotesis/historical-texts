            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <label>ANSWER</label>. It is a rare unuſual queſtion, in theſe times, which ye now make, though nothing more highly rational and neceſſar, and ſuch as gives occaſion to ſome ſad reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that may be too obvious on ſuch a ſubject. 1. Of the ſmall account moſt ſeeme to have of time, and of the preſent hours going by, who yet cannot Poſſibly be ſure of the next, nor bring again one minute paſt, time being ſuch a tide, that floweth but once, and muſt be either taken, or loſt for ever, 2. How very ſad the ordinary diſcourſe in ſociety and viſites moſt make to other, is ſuch, that if one ſhould keep ſilent, and overtake with a pen, what too frequently paſſeth in theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, and but read it over again, they could not but both wonder and be aſhamed at ſo ſtrange and deformed an image of themſelves. 3. That when ſuch mutual converſe and ſociety together puts oft a price in mens hand, for ſome gainful improvment hereof, and to make an intereſt for the Lord, with that Chriſtian pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and ſobriety, in giving others an occaſion, more than to appear themſelves; yet how rare is it almoſt to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45536:4"/>
know Chriſtians to be truely ſuch by their walk, except in the duties of Worſhip, as if their intereſt were not more to <hi>live</hi> Religion, than to Profeſs it; and that ſo ſolemne and great a buſineſs is now before all to die; and know what an eternity means, with ſo marvellous a change we muſt admit in another world, whither this preſent hour we haſten, yea how few can be ſeen in their travelling garbe with their loynes trimmed, and their lamps burning; but rather as ſuch who minded a ſetling here.</p>

That a due reſtraint thus is not eaſy, or to keep within theſe bounds of Chriſtian Liberty, which is found in the cloſe to bring a ſting merewith more imbittering, than the former pleaſure <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To guard againſt <hi>Credulity,</hi> or a being haſty to conceive an injury and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45536:6"/>
too great a weight on ſudden conjectures and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which tends both to darken and diſquiet the mind; none ever yet gained by indulgence hereto, but how oft have their after thoughts enforced an upbraiding of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with weakneſs and folly? 2. How ſweet and eaſy might this become to us in learning that leſſon more from our bleſſed Maſter of <hi>Meekneſs, Matth.</hi> 11: <hi>ver.</hi> 29. Which is one of the rare graces of the Spirit, and no ſoftneſs of nature, ſo bleſſed a cure and relief to the moſt tart and froward temper hath ſuch advantage with it to convince the World, and conciliat mens reſpects to the truth of holineſs, who look but at a diſtance by ſo love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and gaining an appearance? And why is ſuch a cover put on an imbittered and paſſionat diſpoſition, that it is their natural complexion? it may be true, but it is ſure, it is black nature unſubdued to the grace of God; whilſt many naturally paſſionat and cholerick have through grace got that conqueſt over themſelves, as few with whom they have converſed could diſcerne any ſuch thing, even upon moſt remarkeable provocations. 3. To know, and be under ſome weight of this, as a ſpecial opportunity for the Lord, the loſs whereof ſhould be a loſs indeed, when there is ſuch a call, to <hi>requite evil with good,</hi> both in doing and ſpeaking, <hi>and your reward ſhall be great Luk.</hi> 6: <hi>v.</hi> 35. And are not a Chriſtians <hi>opportunities</hi> a part of his <hi>riches</hi> and treaſure? I know this will ſeeme a ſtrange contradiction to many, but a ſubdued Chriſtian by the grace of God, is a ſtrange and marvellous thing. 4. Let us know more what it is to be <hi>humble,</hi> and then forbearance and tender condeſcendence in our walk with others will natively follow. O bleſſed <hi>humility,</hi> that ſhineth moſt in its diſappearing, and layes the Chriſtian more truely near his hope, yea nearer to heaven, when it layes his face on the duſt, than when his head hath ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be among the ſtarrs. O what ſweet and deſireable ſociety ſhould this make amongſt Chriſtians, which teacheth effectually to paſs by injuries, and not ſeek
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45536:7"/>
their own glory, or to dare a deſpiſing of others; which by keeping the Spirit low fitts them for nearer converſe with God, and a being led in the way of his Counſels, and whilſt pride ſwells, and cauſeth a fever in the ſoul, this brings ſo ſweet and ſenſible a coole thereto; Yea is one of the two great loſſons, that Chriſt hath put by themſelves <hi>Matth.</hi> 11: <hi>v.</hi> 29. and thus enſured a reſt and tranquillity of ſoul, whatever be the changes of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Lot. 5. Let us alſo for this end get ſight much kept of that great example ſet before us for our confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity thereto, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2: 23. <hi>who being reviled, reviled not again, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly,</hi> and it is ſure we then fruſtrat our relief in the laſt part of theſe words, if the firſt be not ſeriouſly taken alongs therewith. 6. We have this excellent mean alſo expreſly commanded us, <hi>to ſeek peace with all men and follow after it Pſ.</hi> 34: <hi>v.</hi> 14 <hi>Heb.</hi> 12: 14. Yea even with ſuch, from whom we may have ſuſtained greateſt injury; nor can it anſwer this to give it entertainment, when it comes; but to goe forth and meet the ſame, yea to ſeek it when it is a miſſing, and though it flee, to follow it. O! what a lovely appearance doth this put upon Chriſtians, and gives them a greatet Victory, than to overcome a City, when thus grace in its vigorous exerciſe in one, meets with the prevailing corruption of another: and by yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcomes; by a humble condeſcendence ſubjects the proud, ſo as to enforce their falling before that more excellent Spirit, with a diſcerneable aw &amp; authority over them, for <hi>greater is he, who is in them, than</hi> he <hi>who is in the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4? <hi>v</hi> 4. 7. Let us be tender in taking offence no leſs, than in giving, in a haſty judging of perſons, or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at a diſtance, when we cannot ſo certainly know, what circumſtances may concurre in ſuch a caſe, and ſure each may know, how many things have begot jealouſy &amp; bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit, which upon more clear and convincing trial have not had the leaſt ground, whilſt thus the great Adverſary of the Church geteth advantage. 8. To be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45536:7"/>
ſlow to ſpeak, which hath its peculiar beauty and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage at all times is of ſingular uſe here, when under any ſtirre or perturbation of Spirit, thus to get a reſtraint over themſelves, till the water be more clear, and the mudd fallen to the ground. O what a choice mean were this to prevent the frequent diſcompoſure many fall in, to be under ſome ſerious and ſevere reſolution, not to ſpeak for ſome time, when they are provoked, and how ſweet and quieting ſhould this be upon after thoughts? 9. A being much at home by ſelf - reflection, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our eyes turned inward, ſhould much help to blunt the keenneſs of that edge, which is too oft againſt others, and put Chriſtians on another ſcent, how <hi>to reſtort ſuch with the Spirit of meekneſs, who may be over taken with a fault, conſidering thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted, Gal.</hi> 6: <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.

That one Chriſtian cannot beget

another; and how far this new life by grace is above nature, or the poſſibility of ſecond cauſes, which no arguments, or perſuaſives of eloquence by moral influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence conld ever effectuat, but is the immediat work of the Spirit, and forming of a new <hi>Creation</hi> by the Word of the Goſpel, in the naked ſimplicity thereof. 2. How clear is the truth of this marvellous ſtate of grace by ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible a reality of the effects and operations thereof; as to change an impoiſoned nature, and take off that imbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to ſpiritual things; the ingrafting of the Word by a ſecond impreſſion of the Law written upon the heart and inward parts, whereby it is transformed into the ſame image; yea ſuch convincing effects, as a living Chriſtian may be as diſcerneable, as one being a living man, by ſignes and marks peculiar to his kind. 3.

                  <hi> I confeſs it is not eaſy, except men turne reſolutely Atheiſts, to debate this Truth, but oh! what should it meane, that ſo few can be ſeen in earnest in ſuch a throng of profeſsed Chriſtians, with that excellent ſtudy of Holineſs, who yet come the furthest length in an aſſent thereto, and what might most help for this end?</hi>

               <p>ANSW. It is irreſiſtible grace which alone can make this effectual. But I ſhall offer ſome few enforcing motives for ſo great and neceſſar a ſtudy, with this one deſire, that you might but in earneſt think thereon, when alone. 1. That it is more excellent and deſirable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe grace, than to enjoy comfort, when the more ſharp and ſearching conflicts this meets with for trial, the more fruit and gain is going to the fore here and for ever; Yea are not the moſt remarkeable aſſaults and trials of a Chriſtians life ſome of his greateſt opportunities for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45536:12"/>
                  <hi>ſowing to the Spirit, Ga.</hi> 6: <hi>ver</hi> 8. <hi>and being faithful to their meaſure and talent, Matth.</hi> 25: <hi>ver.</hi> 15. Yea ſuch, wherein our bleſſed Head, in the truth of his grace in them, and marvellous power thereof, hath ſo conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous a triumph in each of his people, which ſhould be accounted a gain to ſuch, beyond the ſaddeſt loſs they can ſuſtaine otherwiſe. 2. That not the leaſt act, or exerciſe of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and whatſoever hath been done for the Lord can be loſt, but ſhall be had in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and abide for ever, in its eternal reward; yea nothing of the Chriſtians work in doing, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during, their ſecret wreſtlings againſt ſin, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of temptations, mortification, and patience for the name of Chriſt, when moſt hid from the eyes of men, ſhall be forgot by him who ſees in ſecret, to meet them once and for ever, with their Maſters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, <hi>well done, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 25: <hi>ver.</hi> 21. in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of joy, and their being rewarded before the Angels and all the Redeemed. O who would not run, though all the way ſhould be through thickets of briars and thorns, who have ſuch a joy and hope ſet before them? And that here is no doubtful or conjectural thing, go to the Scripture and ſee what is ſo expreſly ſhewed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4: <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>For our light affliction which is but for a moment</hi> (whereby the Chriſtians Sanctification is both tried and exerciſed) <hi>worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 7. <hi>That the trial of your faith being much more precious, than the Gold that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praiſe, and glory, and honour, at the appearance of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 14: <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>And I heard a voice from Heaven, ſaying unto me, Bleſſed are the dead, who die in the Lord, from hence forth: Yea ſaith the Spirit, for they reſt from their labour; and their works do follow them;</hi> They go not before, ſince it's the blood of Chriſt which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can do this, and make ſure the Chriſtians entry into that bleſſed Land: But they ſhall aſſuredly follow, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45536:12"/>
abide for ever before the Lord. 3. And is not <hi>Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> the higheſt excellency that humane nature is capable of, &amp; no leſs marvellous than our redemption by Chriſt from eternal wrath, in having the ſoul thus ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by grace, &amp; to be made partakers of the <hi>Divine Nature?</hi> O how great and aſtoniſhing a thing is it, that the ſeed &amp; principles of Holineſs in the Chriſtian ſoul ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved amidſt ſuch continual aſſaults of corruption with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, &amp; theſe temptations that are without, as a ſpark of fire in the midſt of waters, which impetuouſly run to quench the ſame; yea that ſuch a party, as the Devil, the world and the flesh, by which the moſt of mank ind is ſo viſibly enſlaved, and kept in chaines, yet thus m ade to fall in their greateſt ſtrength, before the truth of Holineſs, in the meaneſt of the Saints, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here for them <hi>to boaſt in of themſelves, but in the power of Chriſt thus reſting upon them,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12: <hi>ver.</hi> 9? That day, O bleſſed day! is approaching, when this Scripture ſhall be fully underſtood, which I have ſome ti mes thought on, as a truth of greateſt weight, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1: 10. <hi>When he shall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired in all them that beleeve:</hi> Which is not only to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by them, but in them: for what he hath wrought and perfected in them, as well as done for them. 4. Is it not known and tried, that without <hi>Holineſs</hi> in its live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe, all aſſayes for inward peace or tranquillity of mind, and that compoſure of the affections, which is both ſo comforting &amp; beautifying of a Chriſtian, will be in vaine? and oh! what does remain, if this be not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, what a preſent and ſenſible reliefe is here in <hi>Love, Humility, Meekneſs, Patience</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> to the ſaddeſt diſtempers of the mind? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1 19: <hi>ver.</hi> 165. <hi>great peace have they that love thy Law, and nothing shall offend them.</hi> That whilſt Satan is at the furtheſt at work to faint and cruſh the Chriſtian in his journey homeward: yet can he only reach a bruiſing of their heele, who are thus ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>by the whole armour of God,</hi> from a thruſt at their vital
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45536:13"/>
parts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6: <hi>ver,</hi> 14. and therefore it is remarkeable, that there is no piece of armour there given for the back, but only to ſuch as withſtand and reſiſt, nor to thoſe who flie. 5. Is not the fruits of <hi>Holineſs</hi> that peculiar <hi>Revenue,</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt calleth from his followers here, to adorne the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and ſhew his grace towards them has not been in vain? And are not theſe ſuch <hi>fruits</hi> which can only be brought forth in the ſeaſon thereof, a ſeaſon that is ſhort, and for all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity will not recurre again? 6. It is ſure, nothing is ſo lovely to raviſh the ſoul with the glory and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thereof as this, were it <hi>ſpiritually</hi> diſcerned; to ſee and admire that infinit purity, righteouſneſs, truth and love ſhining in the great patterne Chriſt himſelf, and what a marvellous luſtre the reflection hereof hath, even on his followers here on the earth, in ſome begun con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to his glorious image, whilſt not one glance thereof in truth, (what ever be of a falſe shew) is to be found in the whole world beſides. Oh were it believed, how much of Heaven might be enjoyed here by a greater length in the ſtudy of Holineſs, and what inexpreſſible joy, peace and ſerenity of Spirit doth aſſuredly wait thereon; what ſweet facility and delight is thus reached in the Chriſtians work, when their motion lyes from the inward principles of a new life, yea that it is ſure, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt this day is by grace called up to a higher ſtate, than that of the greateſt Monachs of the earth, and if there were no greater intereſt and preferment to be looked after than what the world can beſtow on any, we could not eaſily know what were deſireable here in being men.</p>

                  <hi> Since theſe truths are to the furthest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing and clear, and that it is ſure, this is the great buſineſs I have to follow in the few dayes I am to be upon the earth, to be aſſured of an eternal bleſſedneſs; I would in earnest know, what are the most clear and undeniable marks from the Scripture, of a <hi>being in</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:45536:13"/>
                     <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the certainty of <hi>converſion,</hi> that I leane not my peace here on ſome falſe ground, when it is ſo amazing at what rate many now own themſelves to be Chriſtians; for if I be deceived thereanent, and go with the multitude; Oh then I am deceived indeed, which eternity cannot recover again, through want of the ſerious trial of this within time?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSW. It is a great buſineſs you are upon, and aſſuredly the higheſt work of a Chriſtians life now to live for God, and to know they ſhall for ever be with him in glory: Oh! how rare are thoſe in this age, who are on this trial, and to work out their Salvation in fear and trembling: Whilſt ſuch a throng is about the things of this life, as almoſt no time can be found for the one <hi>neceſſar thing.</hi> It is ſure, to have an evidence of our being in the ſtate of grace, is of more worth than all the trouble can be in acquiring it, and if ſuch die in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake here, they are then undone for ever; But, it is ſtrange, what means ſuch halting and uncertainty in this matter, when it is ſo clear. 1. That there is a certainty attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of ones ſtate and being in Chriſt, as can make it eaſy to adventure into eternity with that aſſurance, <hi>for me to die is gain, Phil.</hi> 1. 21. and that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73: 24. <hi>He will guide me by his counſel, and afterward receive me to glory:</hi> Which I am ſure, were it more underſtood, the greateſt trial of a Chriſtian then ſhould be more how to bear his joy, than his griefs, even under the ſoreſt preſſure of affliction; yea the greateſt acts of patience and ſelf denial would be to be willing and ſubmiſſive to ſtay for ſome time here. 2. It is ſure, the Scripture leaves none to a doubtful or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain enquiry anent this; but hath ſo clear and diſtinct a ſound, as none needs ſay, <hi>Who shall go up to Heaven,</hi> that we may know, whether we ſhall dwell there for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, for <hi>the Word is near, Rom.</hi> 10: <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. <hi>ver.</hi> 12. and <hi>theſe things are written that our joy may be full,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:45536:14"/>
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1: <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and <hi>that theſe who believe, may know they have eternal life,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5: <hi>ver.</hi> 13. 3. Though the work of trial anent a Chriſtians ſtate be of greateſt weight, yet lyes it not in any long circuit, or many words, but it is ſuch as from ſome few clear, plaine and infallible markes, which are founded upon cleareſt evidence from the Scripture, may be with the furtheſt certainty determined. 4. It is to the <hi>touch ſtone,</hi> but not to the <hi>ballance</hi> a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian muſt here come for trial, that it be true in the kind, even whilſt the degree and meaſure may be very ſmall to their eyes. 5. But it is needful to know that the loweſt degree of grace is above flesh and blood, ſo as none can come to Jeſus Chriſt, without a drawing power from himſelf, and ſuch a pull at the heart, as muſt bring the grip with it. But to come a little more near to your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. Do you in truth queſtion, if you have ever yet paſt the new birth, and be in the ſtate of grace, and where you ſhall dwell for ever? You may then bring it to a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy cloſe upon theſe clear and undeniable grounds. 1. That the Scriptures bring down before our eyes that greateſt depth of <hi>election,</hi> ſo as it can be no more ſure ſuch shall be ſaved, who are predeſtinat to life, were it poſſible to ſee their names write in that ſecret roll of the eternal counſel of God, than it is ſure ſuch are elected, and shall undoubtedly be ſaved, who have come to Jeſus Chriſt in the acceptation of his offer in the Goſpel; for thus muſt we firſt make <hi>our effectual calling ſure,</hi> and then we aſſuredly know <hi>our election.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 10. 2. There can be no debate here, that where converſion is, the work of the Spirit muſt be then known in convincing men of ſin. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16: 9. ſince the great healer can be no Phyſician to the <hi>whole,</hi> but to the <hi>ſick. Matth.</hi> 9: 12. ſuch, who have been in ſome meaſure Pricked to the heart with ſuch a ſight of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate, the ſinfulneſs of ſin, the Spiritual extent of the law in ſome ſuch meaſure and degree, as is needful to make roome for Jeſus Chriſt, who had never a weight on them before; that as the needle in the compaſs is in a continued agitation, and cannot fixe unril it be at the right point and

ſettle there, then, O then is there no poſſible quiet, until they have <hi>found a reſt in Jeſus Chriſt Matth.</hi> 11 29. 3. <hi>If any be in Chriſt, he is a new Creature</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5: 17. which is the <hi>new man</hi> that all muſt put on, who were ever ſavingly called, and thus know what it is to have that witneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of the ſanctifying work of the Spirit, which is alwayes a ſure, though not alwayes alike clear evidence of a new ſtate and <hi>being in Chriſt Rom.</hi> 8: 1. Yea it is ſure, the <hi>new birth</hi> muſt be once paſt here. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3: 3. elſe you are loſt for eternity, and now judge what comforting evidence you have got of this, if you were to look death at this preſent hour in the face. 4. Is any thing more plain and expreſs, than this is from the Scripture, that to ſuch as are ſaved, the truth of the Goſpel, and of a <hi>crucified Chriſt is the power and the wiſdome of God?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1: 24. and have you this witneſs to bear from undoubted experience, that you have got ſuch a ſight of the drawing power and beauty of Jeſus Chriſt in the offer of the Goſpel, that paſſeth natural underſtanding as hath determined your conſent to the furtheſt to embrace ſo invaluable a bargain, though it should be at the rate to <hi>ſell all</hi> to make ſuch a purchaſs. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13: 46? 5.

And now can you upon ſureſt triall <hi>put to your ſeale that God is true</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? 6.

Is it not with a renewed ſtate by grace this alſo muſt be known, what the Spiritual way of ſervice to God in the deauties of Worship is, in the <hi>newneſs of the Spirit, and not in the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Letter.

Now are not theſe few <hi>marks</hi> on ſuch clear and undeniable Scripture grounds, as it is ſtrange what should make this a dark buſineſs to any, who would not make it their choice to hold faſt deceit, or goe down with a lie in their right hand to the grave, though the comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and clear evidence, thereof be not the ſame at all times, nor in the ſame meaſure and degree alike to all.</p>

Is <hi>the one neceſſar thing;</hi> and is not an eternity of ſuch weight, that if there were many ages enſured to us, much more a few dayes, which are wholly uncertain, here were enough to keep us in ſome continued throng. It is ſure, either heaven and a glory there for ever, and the truth of a hell and everlaſting torment muſt be to ſuch but a dreame, and a conjectural thing, elſe there could be no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible quiet without a knowing where they muſt dwell for ever. 2. Can this be deferred whilſt we ſee time makes ſuch ſwift diſpatch, and that it is ſure, while we now live and breath, we are a <hi>dying</hi> and hath it in ſome degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and advanced every hour of our life? and Oh! should <hi>dying</hi> men keep at a diſtance from the thoughts of death, who ſo oft may hear it ſound; and the bell ringing for others? 3. Can this admit a <hi>delay</hi> to ſuch, were it but for ſome few dayes or hours, who cannot poſſibly be ſecured, when they ly down at night, but their breath may be ſtopped by a ſudden ſurpriſe of death ere they awake; yea thus ſleeps at an adventure of being ere the next day in an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably loſt ſtate? 4. Can there be a <hi>delay</hi> here by ſuch, who knowes not only the night is coming, when none can work, but are ſo uncertain, if the firſt touch of ſickneſs and approach of death be not a lethargy, wherein they can neither know, nor reflect on their own caſe, which I have known remarkably to have befallen ſome, who uſed to make ſuch an account, they would take Religion to heart, when once they were dying? 5. Is it not needful ſuch have the work of their day put by in the ſeaſon thereof, without a daring to lay it over; when to be ſick and die is ſo great and ſolemne a work by it ſelf? 6. Was it not then too late for the <hi>foolish Virgins,</hi> to ariſe and beſtirre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they had loſt their ſeaſon of the Goſpel, or to make ready upon a <hi>midnight</hi> cry, when they had ſlept the time of their work and duty, and is not this put upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord by the Holy Ghoſt, for all after ages; <hi>that they may be readie with their loines girded, and their lamps burning,</hi> who know that death certainly is before them, and knowes not but that it come as a thief in the night? 7.

               <p>ANS. You know that it is no words can tell, what a thing day light is to them that never knew it, which can only be known by its own evidence; nor is it poſſible to give an account in another way of a ſpiritnal diſcerning the things of God, which not in degree but kind is as far above the light of nature and reaſon, as that of the ſun is above a Candle. O what another thing is a ſpiritual acquaintance with the things themſelves held forth in the Scripture, than any notions or knowledge of the Doctrine thereof, which may enable to talk or diſpute, whilſt the power and efficacy thereof was never known on the ſoul: yea nor the writing of the Law upon the heart; and to <hi>learne the truth as it is in Jeſus. Epheſ</hi> 4: 21. but for anſwer to your propoſal, I shall tell you in a few words what ſuch are admitted to ſee, yea are perſwaded of the undoubted certainty thereof, whilſt others neither know nor ſee what they ſee, but are wholly ſtrangers thereto. 1. The excellency and lovelineſs of their beloved Maſter, ſo as to them there is but one <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Heaven and in earth, whoſe roome none can fill but himſelf, yea can give that anſwer to ſuch as enquire, <hi>he is</hi>

It is not <hi>that marvellous light</hi> only breaks then in, at their firſt entry into a ſpiritual ſtate, but there is a ſight ſometimes a Chriſtian hath of Scripture Truths, and breaking up of ſome further diſcovery there to their ſoul, that if they would give all the world, they cannot have at other times. 4. Such know aſſuredly the truth of a <hi>new nature,</hi> which is ſo wonderful, and wholly a ſupernatural thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with natural reaſon can have no acquaintance, nor is it ſtrange how much others are in the dark to this, who know ſo little of their own ſoul what it means, except by the power and operations thereof. 5. Do you ask what ſuch know or diſcerne in the things of God to which moſt are ſtrangers? they ſee the <hi>Glory and beauty of holineſs, the truth of Spiritual things, which is the hidden things of God in a myſtery.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2: 7. yea thus are taken in to ſee theſe great things, not in a notion thereof, but in their Spiritual Nature, as they are ſealed with power and efficacy on their ſoul? 6. It is given to ſuch to know alſo, (which the Spirit only can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale &amp; teach,) what a ſweet accord there is in theſe <hi>Depths</hi> of providence betwixt the Chriſtians croſs and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, their being <hi>cast down, yet not deſtroyed, to be ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, yet alwayes rejoicing, yea in having nothing, yet to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs all things.</hi> and are not theſe ſuch things that could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver poſſibly have entred into mens thoughts, if they were not made known from a higher airth?

You may but judge what a ſad part that of the Saints were, if in this life their <hi>hope</hi> were only, or what could poſſibly be comforting to moſt in ſuch a day, whoſe griefs are in earneſt, if the Truth and Comforts of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life should be a doubtful thing to them. 3, What gain or intereſt could any ſnch poſſibly have to deſigne a falſe Witneſs and Teſtimony, yea, with ſuch aſſured confidence, from experience, if they were not at the furtheſt certainty thereof; yea thus to converſe ſo much in the Duties of Godlineſs, where you ſee they cannot be but a toile to the flesh, if the peace of God, and Joy and Comforts of the

You know the Doctrine of the Goſpel is a Doctrine of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the whole of that bleſſed contrivance doth moſt native<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolve. And is not the truth hereof write forth in ſuch viſible realities before your eyes, as it may be no leſs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in its <hi>Examples</hi> than <hi>Precepts?</hi> I hope there is no debat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here. 5. It is ſure, the diſcoveries of the word do not direct men to things a far off, but to ſuch as brings the great things of the Goſpel <hi>near,</hi> even in to their heart, ſo as to handle and feele by experience the truth thereof; and you know the conſolation of the Spirit is not by words, but by <hi>things,</hi> giving into the ſoul a ſpiritual and ſenſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the reality thereof, and of the <hi>Love of Jeſus Christ</hi> let forth to them. 6. And are not theſe marvellous effects and operations of the Spirit of God, in ſubduing the ſoul by grace, ſo as to embrace an afflicted lot and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation for the Goſpel, to <hi>take joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods,</hi> yea to dip their hands in the blood of a beloved ſin, and find delight thus in doing violence to the flesh, ſuch as may shew that it is ſure, Chriſtians muſt know &amp; enjoy, what they and moſt of the world are ſtrangers to?

               <p>A. This muſt be matter of aſtonishment and wondering for all eternity, and it were well, if ſuch an exerciſe were more begun here, to enquire and wonder at what we know of the great truths of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> but it is ſure, it were the higheſt of pride, not humility to hold back where the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God calls; or for a perishing man not to throw out his armes and ſwime to <hi>a rock,</hi> when it is before his eyes, and is not the <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſuch a contrivancc, as the whole of the Saints ſince the beginning could not poſſibly have a wish beyond the ſame, to shew forth that marvellous condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendence, freedome and plainneſs which is there, yea where none can be afrighted away who with deſire did ever follow to this bleſſed airth. But ſince this is of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, not for a Chriſtians Peace and Perſonal Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only, but to bear witneſs to the bleſſed way of the

Lord, and ſhew how deſperat an Oppoſition theirs muſt be, whoſe hearts are not melted and gained by ſuch inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible tenderneſs and <hi>condeſcendence</hi> of the Goſpel; let me ſpeak theſe few words. 1. You know that ſuch this is, as none can come wrong, if they <hi>come</hi> but in truth upon ſuch an errand, as the felt <hi>need</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt: and therefore is the Scripture ſo expreſs here. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6: 37. <hi>and whoſoever cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out, ſais he who is faithful and true,</hi> yea ſuch, as the whole of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth remarkeably ſhew, See <hi>Rev.</hi> 22: 17. <hi>and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will, let him come and take of the waters of Life.</hi> 2. Such is his way, on whom the alone weight of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples intereſt and ſalvation leanes, as he both formes the deſire of the ſouls of his people, and ſatisfies the ſame; nor can there be in truth a <hi>hungring</hi> and deſire after him, but their Enjoyment is thus begun. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5: <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. 3. What can be more <hi>condeſcending,</hi> than his way is to the loweſt, whoſe ſoul doth but in a ſerious <hi>look</hi> follow, when it is in truth, when there is almoſt no more can be reached. <hi>Eſai.</hi> 45: 22. if thus the heart be but laid open to ſeek a relief in him, yea to <hi>look as a far off</hi> to that, even to which they fear to approach. 4. And is not ſuch his way, that the greateſt thing he moſt expreſſy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in the ſaddeſt caſe of felt and diſcovered guilt, is to <hi>flee</hi> in but for ſhelter to him from that dreadful purſute of an awakned conſcience? yea how marvellous is this that as their face is towards the <hi>Gofpel,</hi> there is the moſt ſenſible inlet to <hi>contrition</hi> and brokenneſs of heart, and ſerious exerciſe of repentance. which as a ſweet and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive reſult followes thereon? O! what is given for the furtheſt clearing hereof in the Scripture? See <hi>Zach.</hi> 12: 10. <hi>Act.</hi> 5: 31. 5. Such is his way, as he hath come under bond and promiſe by his faithfulneſs to make forthcoming to his people, which is only of grace, he hath promiſed to give what he requires, yea <hi>to work their works in them, as well as for them, Eſai.</hi> 26: 12. 6. Such is his condeſcendence, that his peoples ſecurity ſhould
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45536:20"/>
leane on nothing in themſelves, not on their own <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending but being apprehended. Phil.</hi> 3: 12. Yea that when any of his people, broken under the ſenſe of guilt have no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to make uſe of; or confidence to adventure, he finds them one in himſelf. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13: 9. O <hi>Iſrael, thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thy help.</hi> 7. Such is his way, where there is no exception of perſons, but the poor made moſt dearly welcome, and brought near in his offer; <hi>when the proud,</hi> were they the greateſt Monarchs in the earth, <hi>he knowes a far off.</hi> 8. This is he, and ſuch is his bleſſed way, as the ſeverity of the <hi>Law</hi> muſt ſerve for that very end, to commend <hi>Jeſus-Christ</hi> and lead in to him, and the felt weight of ſin bring a begun cure and relief therewith in the felt need of a Saviour. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11: <hi>v.</hi> 28. 9. Such is his bleſſed way, as yet <hi>did never break a bruiſed reed nor quench a ſmoking flaxe, Eſai.</hi> 42: <hi>v.</hi> 3. Nor put ſuch back, whoſe feare to adventure made them to ſtand a far off, with the poor <hi>Publican. Luk.</hi> 18: 13. Yea of whom, all who ever knew him muſt bear him this witneſs, he is tender and compaſſionat in his ſharpeſt reproofs; and when he wounds ſoreſt, then is it <hi>that he doth most earneſtly remember with the ſounding of his bowels towards them. Jer.</hi> 31: 20. 10. Such is he, &amp; his way towards his Church here upon the earth, as he hath given ſome peculiar Lines in his Word, of his tender regard to ſuch, even beyond others, who are moſt <hi>deſtitute</hi> of outward help <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146: <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40: <hi>laſt.</hi> And comes ſo low to take in thoſe that are moſt rejected of others, and may have leaſt notice or regard at the time, and therefore, when he was himſelf on the earth, he was <hi>called a friend of Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and ſinners, Matth.</hi> 11: 19. 11. Such is his way, whoſe peace and acceptance hath ſo oft met his people, as a bleſſed ſurpriſal, when they knew leaſt how to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, and then given them a moſt unexpected wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, when they have been under the greateſt fears <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18: 4: and 116: 3, 4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15: 20. 12.

there is a ſolemne appeale here to every ones perſonal <hi>trial,</hi> for the truthand certainty hereof. 2. That it is with the firſt being of Chriſtians, and when once a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life is formed in the ſoul, how <hi>prayer</hi> then is as their natural work, like the tendency and breathing of the child after the breaſts. 3. And is it not clear that ſuch have got a new acquaintance, and muſt know ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſociety</hi> than men, to make their retirements ſweet and deſireable; yea that continued haunt and reſort to this bleſſed airth, ſhewes the truth of commerce and trading with another world, is known to ſuch with the greateſt of certainty? 4.

would most help to make this duty both comforting and eaſy, whilst there is ſuch difficulty to many, how to expreſs themſelves thisway, and others find it a ſore wearineſs to the flesh, yea leſs eaſy to be thus alone, and take ſome time for ſecret prayer, than to wait on publick duties, or joine with others in ſuch a work?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSW. I hope you know. 1. That as our tye to the publick duties of worſhip is great and indiſpenſible, to improve fellowſhip with others in the exerciſes of Godlineſs, yet moſt of a Chriſtian and his work, is that which is leaſt ſeen, and lyes hid from the view of others; yea the moſt weighty duties of Chriſtianity are the more retired and ſecret duties thereof, ſo that a true meaſure of a Chriſtian, muſt not be from what he is in publick, and converſe with others, but what he is <hi>alone,</hi> where he lies open to his witneſs, who ſearcheth the heart. 2. Such can only blame themſelves, and are ſadly eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the truth of Godlineſs, if they know nothing elſe, but to be alone in their retirements, who are then called to an immediate fellowſhip with God in Chriſt, and to know the truth thereof on trial. 3. You know a natural motion is eaſy and without conſtraint, and were this once underſtood, how prayer is a ſoul-work, and to carrred forth from inward principles of a new nature then what was a ſore toile here, becomes their ſweeteſt delight; for to pray, is not an expreſſing to the Lord what ſhould be ones deſires, but a preſent breathing of the ſoul in deſires after him: when the pleaſure of Religion is ſo known with the power and life thereof. 4. The more weight and burden of the Chriſtians caſe on himſelf, is a tried help for more facility and life in the work of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

Is it a ſmall thing to be <hi>anſwered with ſtrength in your ſoul;</hi> and for being helped to wait, until the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate more fully break up, ſince a divine power may be no leſs marvellouſly ſeen in the Chriſtians ſupport, than in the moſt aſtoniſhing delivery? 4. Is not a ſubdued Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, with a humble reſignation to the Lord under a long deferred hope, a higher mercy, when truely conſidered, than the thing it ſelf which we moſt follow? And are theſe loſers, where thus more is given, than what they either ſought or hoped for. 5.

               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. It is not ſtrange, where the truth is not received in love, that men kindle a light to themſelves, and walk in the ſparks thereof, but I hope you debate not the Scripture, where the ſafe way of being eternally ſaved can only be known; yea, that it is ſure, could we make this way more large and br<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But ſince there is <hi>one way,</hi> and here alone muſt all the redeemed of the Lord get ſafe to that bleſſed land which is above, I hope ye dare own no other conception thereof, than is there expreſly ſhewed. 1. That it is ſuch, where there is no poſſible <hi>latitude</hi> for ſhifting off Fear, Tenderneſs and Diligence in our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian walk, and thus to make ſure for eternal life. 2. That this is the <hi>ſtrait and narrow way,</hi> where the multitude is not to be found, even of ſuch as are under the outward call of the Goſpel; and it is ſure, another way will never be found to the ſecond coming of Chriſt. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13: <hi>v.</hi> 24? 3.

There is no poſſible conception of Religion men can have from the Scripture to take off that indiſpenſible neceſſity of the <hi>new birth,</hi> and writing of the Law upon the heart by the Spirit of God, yea thus to know Religion as an internal thing, which muſt firſt begin at the heart, before it come to the practice. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3: 3. 5.

But it is ſtrange, what is there to enforce any to this, when ſuch is the way of the Lord, that if there could be a latitude for a change, I am ſure, none ever who knew it on trial, could have a wiſh or deſire beyond what it is, nor is it poſſible for any to know the ſpirituality and power of Religion, and not know that ſweetneſs and facility, that is thus in following thereof.</p>

But what do you meane by the delights and ſweetneſs thereof, you have now ſpoke?

ſoul, and to whom a Chriſtians life is indeed a miſtery, but I judge it be not eaſy even for ſuch to ſhift off, or get hid from their eyes the truth of theſe things, which ſo clearly ſhew the alone ſweet and deſireable lot within time, muſt be that of a ſerious Chriſtian, what ever the world be to him; with which. 1. The greateſt Princes, the rich, and thoſe that have lived moſt in the pleaſures of this life, would be glade to <hi>die</hi> and joine intereſts then. 2. Is ſuch, as hath made it ſweet and eaſy, yea on deliberat choice to many, to quite their greateſt intereſt and Comforts within time; which fleſh and blood could never have parted with, if the <hi>exchange</hi> had not been known to be much more gainful. 3. How deſirable is that <hi>lot,</hi> where the Chriſtian can follow his intereſt, by being <hi>abaſed</hi> as well as <hi>abounding,</hi> and by every thing that doth occurre, may know how to be furthered thus in his way; yea riſe by that which would moſt ſeeme to bear him down, and lay him in the duſt; yea thus to gain by greateſt loſſes. 4. Such is the Chriſtians lot, that as his duty and Comfort can never part, or the Teſtimony of his Conſcience anent integrity and ſtraightneſs ceaſe to be matter of his rejoicing, ſo a ſerious ſubjecting and reſignation to the Lord, will never ceaſe to be his reward alſo in the cloſe. 5. How ſad and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting this lot may oft ſeeme, it is here alſo their <hi>Joy</hi> is ſowen by weeping, where that <hi>Seed</hi> was never yet loſt <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126: 5? 6. Would you truely know the ſweetneſs of a Chriſtian lot?

Hath not ſuch, and they only the moſt deſireable part even here, yea can truely feaſt upon their browu bread, with a ſatisfaction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what ever the voluptuous man knew, who knowes not that true peace &amp; ſerenity of mind in Jeſus Chriſt, which guardes the heart from that dreadful ſting that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes on the pleaſures of ſin? It is ſuch can truely ſay (which was the word of one of the Ancients) <hi>O quam ſuave eſt carere hiſce ſuavitatibus, how ſweet to him was it to want theſe carnal delights, wherein others were wallowing;</hi> whilſt their all is in Jeſus Chriſt. But if you ſay, why is not this more diſcerneable amongſt Chriſtians? is not the cauſe here, that a living and vigorous Chriſtian is become ſo rare a ſight at this day? 7. It is theſe, who with Joy can converſe with the thoughts of approaching death, whilſt the <hi>ſting</hi> and <hi>terrour</hi> thereof is taken away. 8. It is theſe, who in the ſerious obſerving of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences both to themſelves and others needs look no where, where they may not ſee what ſhould tend to a further ſtrengthening of them in the way of truth, and that the God whom they ſerve, aſſuredly is what he hath declared himſelf to be. 9.

That this i;'not left arbitrary to any their trading with ſuch a <hi>Talent,</hi> and be concerned how to conſecrat the gain thereof to the Lord; but it is a High Peece of Juſtice, and no leſs neceſſity to ſhew mercy to thoſe who are true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtreſſed, than to pay our <hi>Debts,</hi> ſince the great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver hath not left this indifferent more than the other, as is clear. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16: 10, 11, 12. 3.

Do but lay to heart, that ſuch is this great Duty, in a faithful anſwering to ones <hi>Talent</hi> and meaſure of the things of the world, in a tender reſpect to the <hi>Condition</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity of the Saints,</hi> as in the Day of the Lord it is moſt noticed, and that which will be brought in <hi>Judgment</hi> againſt the reprobate, yea on which that dreadful <hi>Sentence</hi> there paſſeth, <hi>depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire &amp;c.

               <p>ANSW. I hope you will not bring theſe things under queſtion, which may convincingly anſwer this. 1. That a ſerious Chriſtian could yet never be ſo <hi>Low,</hi> but he hath much more than he wants, though he ſhould be put to ſuch a reckoning with <hi>Job.</hi> I have now neither Children, Friends, Honour, or Eſtate in the world to call mine own: but I <hi>know and am ſure that my Redeemer lives.

Have the poor and deſpiſed cauſe to quarrel with their lot, if they be in truth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Grace of God, when it is ſo clear, there can be no ſubſtantial good in riches or honour, which the Lord hath caſt out of the Counſel of his Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe, on whom he hath ſet his heart from eternity? 3.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45536:27"/>
cannot underſtand, and is not owned in the Scripture to be under ſuch a neceſſity to live by faith, which made the Apoſtle give ſuch a ſtrange account, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12; 9, 10.

               </p>
               <p>ANSW. You may judge what a preſſing call ſuch have to be in greateſt earneſt about their eternal ſtate. 1. Who are through moſt of their time ſo near a bordering with <hi>eternity, in deaths often;</hi> and their life hanging ſo frequently in ſuſpence before their eyes. 2.

O! what a book is thus ſpread open for ſea - faring men to read, and bring near their thoughts with wondering, to Fear and Worship him, whoſe <hi>voice is ſo known on the wighty waters;</hi> who turnes the moſt impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſtorme into a calme at his pleaſure, which is ſo far above all hnmane reach, &amp; cauſeth the ſwelling of an enraged ſea in a moment to know his command and be ſtill 3. What ought ſuch to be, who have not only been oft ſurpriſed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45536:29"/>
with preventing mercy, when they were not aware from daſhing on ſome ſhelve or rock, or falling in on a bank of ſand, and thus brought out of greateſt hazard, even before they were put in fear: But have oft likewiſe been reſcued from the very Jawes of preſent Death, in that manner, when no viſible or ordinary means could ever have anſwered thereto. Oh! Can ſuch deliverance be ſo eaſily forgot, and what were then their thoughts of entring into endleſs eternity, and meeting <hi>grim death</hi> with ſuch a ſurpriſe? was it not then a matter of earneſt to pray? Or would you then have dared to break forth into an Oath? yea what a bleſſed ſtate were you then made to reckon thoſe in, who had been formerly ſerious about Religion, and how ſoon may ſuch a ſurpriſal meet you again? 4. What ought ſuch to be, and are accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for, who knowes how many thouſands have been ſwallowed up in theſe devouring Depths, and hears of ſuch ordinary ſhipwracks, whilſt they are yet preſerved? Oh! Doth not this marvellous longſuffering and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord have ſome ſerious voice? Hath it yet never tended to melt your heart with ſorrow and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for ſo ſad a returne you have hitherto given to ſuch forbearance. 5. What ſolemne and expreſs engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are many, if not moſt of ſuch under, and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for, <hi>which their lips have uttered, when trouble was upon them,</hi> and when they were at the very brink of periſhing, that if ſome extraordinary caſt of providence had been deferred but a very few moments longer, they had been loſt? Now ſet me ſeriouſly ask, what did you really intend? Was it to deale deceitfully with the moſt High, and be no more ſerious in the thoughts of this when ye were once at land? If it be ſo, how can you dare to pray and plead with the Holy Lord in a new Strait: Oh! let me beſeech you, lay this to heart, and that to make uſe of your preſent calmes at ſea, for making ſure your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intereſt, would help to make a ſweet calme within on your ſoul when a ſtorme ariſes. 6. Let me but add this
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45536:29"/>
what advantage ſuch have, who have ſo clear an embleme of their life and condition here ſo frequently before them, how thus they are under ſaill, and moving to that port where once the anckor muſt be caſt down never to be weighed again: yea how there can be no ſafe reckoning to get ſafe to that bleſſed, O bleſſed and deſireable <hi>port of glory,</hi> without knowing how their courſe lyes, which from the Scripture is more infallibly clear, than they can be by any Carte or Compaſs? Let me but further add, how ſtrange it is to ſee ſome of theſe, ſo far from under the aw and dread of God; that they are not more concerned to put to <hi>ſea,</hi> and work on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> without any convincing neceſſity, than on any other day?</p>

               </p>
               <p>ANS. I hope you will not dare to debate, 1. That the <hi>Chriſtian Sabbath</hi> hath by the holy Ghoſt that impreſs and authority put upon it, of being the <hi>Lords day,</hi> a day which is ſet a part and conſecrat to him, on a higher ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, than the firſt creation, wherein <hi>God manifeſted in our nature did rest from all his works, for</hi> the <hi>Redemption of his Church; and from</hi> the <hi>new Creation; and ſaw that all which he had done was very good;</hi> that <hi>day</hi> never to be forgot, wherein the Redemption of his Church being perfected, he had a full acquitance for the whole debt of his elect Church; that <hi>day</hi> alſo, on which his moſt uſuall and ſolemne appearance to his Diſciples after his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> was; and shall we deny ſuch a tribute of our obſervance thereof, on ſo great an account: and to him, who hath given us our time, <hi>and is Lord of the Sabbath?</hi> 2. Since it is the alone prerogative of God to make <hi>a day holy,</hi> and that the <hi>first day of the week</hi> is that piece of our time, which is only ſet apart for him under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> should not ſuch a ſolemne and <hi>conſecrat time</hi> be applyed to ſpirituall duties? and is the higheſt of <hi>ſacriledge</hi> to turne that which is <hi>holy</hi> to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45536:30"/>
civill or common actions, when they are no works of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity or mercy, for then is ſuch a day no more <hi>holy</hi> but common. 3. You know how deep the <hi>prophanation</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath been oft found to draw on mens conſcience, ſo as it is rare to ſee a <hi>flagitious perſon</hi> under any remorſe, when brought to a ſcaffold, but hath been then enforced to cry out of the breach of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and how their guilt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in did ſtare them in the face, as a provoking cauſe of what had thus befallen them 4. Should not theſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>marks</hi> of the holy <hi>judgement of God,</hi> which have been thus put both on perſons and places, have an aw and dread on mens conſciences; yea ſuch inſtances, with theſe ſignall and convincing circumſtances, as all might ſee, who looked but at a Diſtance thereon, the ſtroke pointing as with a finger, at the provoking cauſe? 5. Do we hope for an everlaſting <hi>Sabbath</hi> in heaven, whilſt here a few hours in ſpirituall converſe with God, and the ſouls reſting and ſolacing it ſelf in him, is ſo burdenſome a work; yea, whilſt it is ſure, the greateſt of delights and pleaſure known upon the earth are theſe which are Spirituall, to ſuch as ever knew what it is to be Chriſtians?</p>

               <p>ANS I hope with ſome aſſurance I may offer theſe. 1. That ſuch as love the truth would with greateſt ſerious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs watch againſt the <hi>preſent publick, and prevailing evills of the times,</hi> to have their garments kept from the ſmalleſt touch and defilements thereof; I meane ſuch <hi>evills,</hi> after which the <hi>multitude</hi> moſt runs, where the countenance and favourable aſpect of <hi>great men</hi> ſeemes moſt to follow, and is a moſt remarkeable <hi>contagion</hi> in the time; for it is here the ſmalleſt acceſſion will draw deeper on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, &amp; have a more difficult recovery than other perſonal infirmities, &amp; a ſevere withſtanding thereto lead in to moſt ſenſible enjoyments of the Spirit of God. 2.

What a bleſſed aſſay should this be to the Churches healing, if a greater <hi>onneſs</hi> amongſt the godly in theſe times, were with more deſire and intenſeneſs followed; who have this with ſuch expresneſs left by our great Maſter, not only for the credit of the goſpell, and promoting the intereſt thereof, but as a ſeale of our love and obedience to him? Oh! that ſo few are found with that ſuteable weight on their ſpirits to be concerned in this, as though this great duty of mutuall freedome, could not be managed with that humble ceding, and prudent tenderneſs to others, as might tend to a further cementing in love; yea to goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in others hand without any jarre. Let the things of God have a preference to our own things, and our Maſters intereſt be dearer to us, than our ſelves; and Chriſtians will not then long be at ſo ſad a diſtance with others; both in their judgements and affections, but that bleſſed ſtrife ſhould moſt appear, how to ſtrive to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and not againſt other for the intereſt of Chriſt.

ANSW. Friend, this is one of the ſad miſtakes moſt are in, but let me beſeech you, come a little more neer, and then ſee and judge what true peace and quiet ſuch have, what ever preſent ſhun-ſhine they may be under from the World. 1. Who are ſo oft at work, how to bridle their conſcience to frame diverſions, and find out ſome falſe grounds of peace, whilſt the truth of God upon any neer approach is ſo viſible a terrour to them, 2. Why do theſe hate a <hi>ſearching miniſtry</hi> ſo much, though the word name none? Is it not becauſe the light torments them, and they cannot ſtand before it? and are ſuch to be envied by any? 3. How is the ſenſe of guilt, and of their former way ſo affrighting upona ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſtrait, or a neer approach to <hi>death?</hi> or would you wiſh to dy with ſuch, on whoſe very countenance may be oft read, (let them conceale never ſo much,) <hi>theſe dreadfull preſages and fear of a judgment to come?</hi> 4. And is not <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs</hi> a viſible puniſhment to it ſelf, which with ſuch a ſting and fear is haunted, as it may be ſeen, when they ſeek moſt to outdare their conſcience, they find it ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than they, and whilſt no ground of fear or trouble is from without, yet a dreadfull ſound is in their ear, of what is to come? 5. Why are theſe under ſuch dread to be alone, and thus in any meaſure ſerious with their ſoul, to look but over their own caſe, and is this a deſireable peace or quiet? 6. And whence is it that ſo many, who have moſt derided holineſs in their day, are preſſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and call for ſome <hi>ſerious Miniſter of Chriſt;</hi> yea to deſire ſuch moſt, whom they hated before, when death once is dealing with them?</p>

                  <hi> But whilſt the times we are now fallen in are ſo remarkeably ſad and afflicting, what can the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous do, or would most help against the imbittering trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and griefs of a Chriſtian life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSW. Let us conſider 1. How much of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is peculiarly writ for the <hi>afflicted,</hi> and ſuch as have
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45536:33"/>
no viſible help or comfort. 2. That the very nature of <hi>affliction</hi> and trouble is ſo far changed in its being ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiedly exerciſing, as in ſtead of <hi>poiſon</hi> to be made <hi>medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> 3. Are not the Chriſtians ſaddeſt hours on as ſwift a courſe, as their time; and each hour and day putting by ſome part of its appointed meaſure? Yea though ſome <hi>thouſands</hi> of croſſes ſhould be allotted you, they will come to one at laſt, 4. A few hours under the pain of a <hi>wounded Spirit,</hi> and the terrours of the wrath of God, would make ſuch to reckon a freedome from this, (though with the ſoreſt of outward affliction) were a ſweet calme and deliverance. 5. Is not a ſanctified <hi>croſs,</hi> without any bounds ſet to the meaſure thereof, one of the moſt expreſs Scripture <hi>ſignes</hi> of the <hi>love of God</hi> to his own, the want whereof might indeed be the Chriſtians ſoreſt trial, leſt his ſhare be with the World, and ſuch were <hi>Baſtards,</hi> not <hi>Sons?</hi> 6. If you can read the moſt dark and ſaddeſt providence with that Commentar of the Scripture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you will then know how the Saints afflictions ſtand for <hi>bleſſings; Matth.</hi> 5: <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. and <hi>diverſe temptations</hi> to be a ſolide ground of joy and comfort, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1: <hi>ver.</hi> 2. 7. Conſider but in the ſaddeſt <hi>affliction,</hi> how much ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this might have been, and that they are not thus a <hi>ſcandal</hi> to the generation of the righteous. 8; What if a<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l our life had been a continued tract of <hi>grief, bitterneſs and trouble,</hi> and but rarely the leaſt of outward comforts dropt in, and ſo much only given as to keep from ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Oh! durſt ſuch quarrel, who knew of an eternity of joy in the cloſe? 9. It was a <hi>right way</hi> the Lord led his people in, when he led them through a labyrinth of ſore troubles in the <hi>wilderneſs, Pſal.</hi> 107: <hi>ver.</hi> 7. and is there ſhewed as an <hi>embleme</hi> of the journeying ſtate of the Church and each of the Saints here. 10. One ſight of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Land which is above, with the firſt moment of the afflicted Chriſtians entry there, will compenſe to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt a life time of ſorrowes and grief. 11. Is it not here the <hi>faith and patience of the Saints</hi> muſt ſhine forth, the <hi>trial</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:45536:33"/>
whereof is a more invaluable thing, than all the treaſures of the earth. 12. The ſeaſon of <hi>enduring,</hi> you know, is but ſhort, which for all eternity will never meet the Chriſtian again; and Oh! would you loſe even the leaſt of ſuch an opportunity, not in the trial of your faith and patience only, but of your <hi>love</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt, that <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation and diſtreſs was not able to ſeparat betwixt him and you? Rom.</hi> 8: <hi>ver.</hi> 39. And your tried love under ſoreſt outward preſſures may be reported in Heaven and record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there. I ſhall but adde, how ſweet muſt that be to a Chriſtian, when he can ſay, <hi>Let my beloved come and eat of his pleaſant fruits, Cant.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. which to them had moſt pain and wreſtlings in bringing forth.</p>

                  <hi> VVhat are theſe pleaſant fruits, which can be found under the croſs, and the many imbittering griefs and troubles of a Chriſtians life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSW. It is ſure, no ſeaſon hath been more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable for <hi>ſowing to the Spirit</hi> and bringing forth much fruit for the Lord, than a time of the <hi>croſs,</hi> and moſt ſearching trials that way; and theſe have been known to ſuch as were ſuteably exerciſed thereby; the gain and pleaſure whereof hath made the remembrance of their ſaddeſt hours ſweet. 1. When <hi>contrition and tenderneſs, and ſoft walking</hi> before the Lord hath followed thereon; for ſuch are his delight, in whom he takes greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 58: 15. 2. <hi>Humility,</hi> and the Chriſtians geting his Spirit kept low, is ſuch a fruit, as may make their reckoning ſweet on any other loſs; the way to know how to <hi>abound,</hi> is to know <hi>how to be abaſed. Phil.</hi> 4: 12. and this is one of the peculiar ends of afflicting Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, <hi>to hide pride for men. Job.</hi> 33. 17. Obleſſed they who are no leſs concerned to <hi>hide</hi> it from themſelves. 3. Is it not a <hi>pleaſant fruit,</hi> where, by the <hi>croſs</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is more <hi>endeared</hi> to his people, and thus <hi>precious</hi> unto them; their ſoul cleaving to him in deſire and love, even when their ſoul cleaveth to the duſt by a humbling rod? O
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45536:34"/>
what a rent and tribute is this, which in the Chriſtians ſaddeſt hours only can be payed into their bleſſed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter? 4. A through <hi>reſignation</hi> and <hi>ſurrender</hi> to the Lord and his diſpoſal, is a rare and choice improvement of the <hi>Croſs.</hi> Yea it is then found, a Chriſtian to be neereſt his mercy, and his burden moſt ſenſibly grow light; and that this makes a ſpeedy ripening for times of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the preſence of the Lord. 5. This great <hi>fruit</hi> is then to be ſought after, by <hi>beleeving in hope, when it is againſt hope,</hi> which is one of the higheſt pieces of ſervice for giving Glory to God, that a Chriſtian here can be called to, and thus for putting to <hi>their ſeale, that God is true.</hi> 6. It is at the loweſt Chriſtians have the moſt remarkeable advantage, by patient enduring for being <hi>more than conquerours through him that hath loved them. Rom.</hi> 8: <hi>v.</hi> 37. yea that thus the <hi>power of Chriſt resting upon them,</hi> may have in ſuch a greater triumph, and over a more formidable party, than ever <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Caeſar</hi> could boaſt of in all their conqueſts.</p>

                  <hi> VVhilst it may be ſtrange, how ſmall a proportion the practice of most in theſe times ſeeme to have to their light, and mens uſual converſe with reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion more about the uppermost boughs, than to ly neer the great and weighty things thereof; what might most help to put ſome deeper impreſſion and weight of a Chriſtians work on him, and provoke to ſeriouſneſs, by having ſome greatest truths most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently kept in ſight?</hi>

               <p>ANSW. You know, it is not the moſt marvellous things of Religion, nor if one <hi>ſhould riſe from the dead</hi> could deeeply work upon the heart without the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi> But I muſt tell you what was the deſire of a <hi>Judicious Father to a hopleſs ſon, when he was a dying, that he would but once a day take half an hour alone by himſelf, which upon trial and ſome deep reflection,</hi> afterward that young man had, what
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45536:34"/>
this deſire might meane, was bleſſed to be a mean of his recovery: Oh! If moſt who are profeſſed Chriſtians were but once this length, that beſide ſome retirement to prayer, they could but for a few moments be <hi>alone once a day</hi> to conſider theſe <hi>truths,</hi> which I ſhall here inſtance. 1. What were deſireable and comforting in the ſtate of man, if it looked not higher than things ſeen, or his preſent abode in the world? 2. How ſwiſtly are the enjoyments of the earth, and delights of the fleſh gone and periſhed in the preſent uſe thereof? 3. O what ſhould this be to think ſeriouſly on, that the <hi>Goſpel is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted reality,</hi> and ſo far hath the Holy God been mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of man and magniſied him, yea even beyond fallen Angels, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt ſhould have come down to the world</hi> to make a purchaſs of ſuch to himſelf, and ſave them from the wrath that is to come? 4. That the import of the Goſpel is no leſs than an <hi>eternity of Glory,</hi> even to the meaneſt of the Saints; and what a bleſſed ſtrait were this for a Chriſtian; how to divide his wondering betwixt that which is now paſt, in the great work of <hi>Redemption,</hi> and that which is to come, in the full manifeſtation of <hi>Glory.</hi> 5. Let us think more frequently on this alſo, that the pooreſt now on the earth hath an <hi>immortal ſoul,</hi> that is of a more excellent nature, and more ineſtimable value, than theſe viſible Heavens, the Sun, Moon, and Stars; yea ſuch, as no leſs than the blood of the Son of God revealed in our Nature could ranſome from wrath, and yet we put ſo ſmall a price thereon. 5. That it is ſure, ſo great and ſolemne a buſines as <hi>Death</hi> is before us, and we muſt know ſhortly what it means, and to enter into another world. O what will this once be, and ſhould it not now deeply concerne each, that <hi>death come not on all at once,</hi> by more frequent and ſerious converſe therewith? 6. Let us but now bring neer our thoughts what thoughts we ſhall have of the <hi>world,</hi> when our eyes are ſhuting upon it, never to enjoy this any more? And what thoughts that marvellous change muſt cauſe on

mens ſpirits, when once entred into endleſs eternity? 7. How marvellous is this, that may cauſe our hearts to faile with wondering on ſome neer converſe therewith, that not only there is ſuch a hope as to be for ever in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but that our <hi>nature</hi> ſhould be ſo far advanced, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>Nature of Angels,</hi> in that unconceiveable <hi>Union with the divine Nature</hi> conjoined for ever, in our bleſſed head and Redeemer. 8.
