         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which weares out and subdues the most

crumbles into dust and ruin things of
long duration, together with the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,

censures of those who think much of every
<hi>Ayde</hi> and Contribution which they give towards the
effecting or support of their own and their posterities
happiness, be well supposed to be no small cause of
wasting and lessening those Royal supports or means
which our Kings of <hi>England</hi> have heretofore had to do
it withall, and as streams running far from their springs
and fountains without the help or company of other
waters to augment or goe along with them, may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
more then a little to drie up or languish, and
might silence the murmur and complaints of those who
can be content to beg &amp; get all they can from the King,
and by too often by false pretences concealing the worth
or value of what they ask of him, doe gain thereby ten
times more then they seem to request, or he intends
to give them, and making no scruple to deceive him,
which our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> never taught them when he
commanded to give to <hi>Caesar</hi> that which was <hi>Caesars,</hi>
think it is Kingly to be cozened, and that he can never
give, or be deceived too much; yet when he comes to
demand any help or assistance from them, though it be
but for a publick good and their own preservation, can
crie out, burdens and oppressions, and as if he were some
<hi>Ocean,</hi> never to be drawn drie, or Mountain never to be
digged down or exhausted; an <hi>Elixir</hi> to transmute and
enrich others without any wast or diminution of its self,
or the Sun in the firmament, which can enlighten, heat,
and nourish all things and be never the worse for it,
marvail how he can come to want; and if they doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him to be in any necessity, are ready to lay the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99831:5"/>
cause or blame of it upon his Officers for taking more
care of their own Estates then his, and for a thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
way of Arithmetick, by substracting from his to
increase and multiply their own; whilest many who
have but lately tasted of his bounty, or whose Fathers,
Grandfathers or Ancestors have lest them goodly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances,
which were either of the guift of the King or
his Progenitors; or purchased and gained by beneficial
offices and places or imployments under them, can
look upon every Subsidy, Tax or Assessment as a blast,
or mildew of their corn, some plague or epidemicall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
or a greater national calamity, and give them no
better an aspect or entertainment then the children of
<hi>Israel</hi> did their <hi>Egyptian</hi> Tax-masters when they were
commanded to make their Tale of Brick and gather
the straw, though they never repine or grumble at
the same time at ten times a greater sum to a Merry-meeting
or a Feast, or spent in a horse-race, a thousand
or five hundred pounds lost in a night at dice, three or
four hundred pounds spent in a Treatment or Banquet,
or the large or sinfull expensive vanities of themselves
and their wives and children.</p>
            <p>And too many, who would be thought to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Subjects and Patriots then others, can seem
to hate a Civil warre, shrink at the imagination of the
miseries thereof, tremble at a forreign Invasion Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarter,
Plunder, and the Outrage of Souldiers; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of want of Trade, or the guarding of the Seas;
boast of the ancient honour and glory due unto their
Nation, and take a pleasure to recount it to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
or read it in their Histories, and not a few also who
in our late twenty years rebellion, and the spoils and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99831:6"/>
which attended it, could drive honester men
then themselves into Taxes and Assessements, and
think a <hi>million</hi> and a <hi>half</hi> in yearly Assessements for
some years together, besides a fifth part of their real
Estates, a twentieth of their personal, and many other
of their Depredations amounting to more then all the
Taxes and Aydes put together, which for five hundred
years last past were imposed by our Kings and Princes, to
be little enough to sacrifice to a mistaken godliness, will
notwithstanding doe as very little as they can to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
any thing to the procuring and enjoying the
blessings of peace and plenty, or avoyd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>And do never so well esteem of their own policies,
as when they can by pretences of debts, poverty, or
charge of children, shift of necessary and publick duties,
and by undervaluing of their own Estates, or overva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing
others, make as smal an offering as they can to
their oathes of Allegiance and Supremacy, and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

            <p>And too too many whilst they cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
if Scripture and the Lawes of God and man may
be their guide and directors, that he hath lately by Gods
mercy and a miracle redeemed them and their Laws and
Liberties out of a slavery which stuck like a leprosie,
and was like to be entailed upon them and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterities,
rescued Religion, and gave them their Lands
and Estates again which the just Lawes of the Land
once called their <hi>Birthright</hi> had forfeited unto him,
can by an unheard and not easily to be believed ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
after his Act of <hi>Oblivion</hi> and Free-pardon, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99831:6"/>
deserved nor purchased, and preferments bestowed
upon them, fall into such an oblivion as nature abhorres,
and humanity must needs blush at, and not offer any
thing in a benevolence ordered by Act of Parliament
instead of a Tax or Subsidie. And very many of those
which did give any thing (some loyal and right-hearted
excepted) having obtained of the King to give away the
principallest <hi>Flower</hi> of his Crown, by releasing of his
Tenures in <hi>Capite</hi> and by <hi>Knights service,</hi> and promised
him Tenures in <hi>Corde</hi> in part of satisfaction, would not
be pleased to find the way afterwards to give him so
much as the twentith part of their yearly vain and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
expences towards the relieving of the publick
and his private necessities.</p>
            <p>For the better information therefore of all such
who are unwilling to part with a Fancy, that the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of our Kings of <hi>England</hi> are immense or largely
sufficient for their occasions, and to dispose them to the
duty which the Laws of God and Men have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and directed; and evidence the reason and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
which the King now hath to demand a supplement
of his Revenue, and for his good people of <hi>England</hi> not
to deny it him, and that the decayes and ruins thereof
have not been occasioned only by an heretofore ill-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of the <hi>Finances,</hi> but by time, and an age of
many ages, multiplicity of expences, indulgences to the
people, and necessity of affirs and government, which
exhausting the radicall heat and moysture, have so spent
the spirits of the body politick, as they have brought
it to that feinting, languishing and weak condition it is
now in.</p>
            <p>It will not be inconvenient from the mountains and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99831:7"/>
hills of time to look down into the valleys of the ages
past and take a short view (for a longer would better
become the designe of a Volume then what is here

to be lawfull and warrantable enough, make their bread
5 or 6 ounces too light, or short of the legal proportions
nor assize, when corn is very dear, and a great deal to
light when it is cheaper: And to add to their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as if otherwise it would not be enough, are suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to mingle chalk and lime amongst their meal, which
makes the white bread, and do by combination with the
Vintners, Inn-keepers and Chandlers (who are the
Belly-Brokers to the poor) make their white bread so
little as to afford them 16. or 18. to the dozen: and if
the Mayor and Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> or the Magistrates of
other Cities or great Towns doe sometimes goe about
to trie and weigh their bread, and find any Basket or
small parcel of bread to be faulty (which by the Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants

very much oppressed, and their poverties made to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the riches of those who are so farre from relieving
their miseries &amp; hardships, as they are a great part of the

not long agoe, were wont to pay but fifteen shillings, for

they must now pay double as much, and that which
they buy is (by the knavery of the Tanner, who to
save the charge of Bark, doth not permit it to lie in the
Tannepit half the time appointed by the Law, and of

Lord Mayor of <hi>London's</hi> Officer who keeps the knife,
as they call it, at <hi>Leaden Hall,</hi> and should seise all bad
Leather) neither well tanned, good, or cheap; by which
villanies, deceipts, careless looking to the execution of
good Lawes, evils of transportation, and some of the
Nobilities and Gentries profuse rates and prices given
to their Shoemakers the shoes which they wear, are
come to the price of five shillings and six pence, and
six shillings a pair; and sober and more carefull men in
the laying out of their money must now doe what they
can, pay four shillings six pence or five shillings for a pair
of Neats Leather shoes, for which within this twenty
years was paid but two shillings eight pence; and when
they have come up to those strange prices, have their
inner soles many times made with chill and soaking Seal

or to be known from a raw hide, it lets in water
like brown paper or bayes, and with a showre of rain, or a
little wet shrivels and runs into wrinckles and an unhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>someness,
and scarcely keeps out a little rain or
dirt which breeds Rheums, Colds and Diseases in
the people who being <hi>Islanders,</hi> and living in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of so much rain and wet, which by some other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
living in drier Countries, called the <hi>Matella

the Lord Chancellor or the Lord Treasurer in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
Assayers or Surveyors of the Bread, Beer, Wine
and Leather made, or to be made or vented in every
County and City, which as concerning Ale and Beer
will be but the same with the Ale-conners and Tasters,
which our antient Lawes and Customes thought neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
and to have for his pains, discovery, prosecution,
and conviction of offenders contrary to the Laws made
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99831:39"/>

Merchants as the Vintners or Retailers.</p>
               <p>6. That no Wine-Cooper be upon a great penalty
suffered to buy or sell wines, which can never be for
the good of the people, when the <hi>Devil</hi> or the <hi>Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi>
having mingled and sophisticated what he bought
pure from the Merchant, shall have power to make it
as bad as he will, and put it to sale when he hath done.</p>

the King not to corrupt or alter their wines, nor willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or wittingly permit them to be adulterated or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

               <p>8. That every Brewer and Baker doe yearly enter
into Recognizances to make wholsome Bread and Beer

               <p>11. That for the first offence every of the said
Tradesmen shall forfeit one hundred pounds, for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
two hundred pounds, and for the third be disfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chised
and never more permitted to use that Trade.</p>
               <p>12. And that a conviction of any such offences may
be pleaded in barre unto them in any Action to be
brought, commenced and prosecuted.</p>
               <p>To be delivered from which great and many deceipts
and frauds, and every dayes often committed oppression,
by a tyranny of the rich over the poor and needy, and to
keep the Wolves from their <hi>morning</hi> and <hi>evening</hi> preys,
and rejoycing in the spoil of the widdows and fatherless,
the hungry and necessitous, which by a cheating and
blinding of their consciences, they will whether the Laws
of God and man will or no, suppose to be lawfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is their Trade, and the misteries of it, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their Fathers or their Masters did it before them;
every one else doth it, and every man must live and

               <p>The people of this Kingdom being so universally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damaged
by the evils happening by them, and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and like to be benefitted by the remedies, may (as

Ale, Beer, Perry or Sider, shall yearly pay to the King,

work of the Publick, be allowed two hours in a day to
work for their own advantage, notwithstanding that
their lodgings, diet, and fitting apparrel be defrayed out
of the Publick; and that the Governours thereof may
for their encouragement have the benefit and liberty of
Exportation and Importation of any the said commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities

collected and assessed in the said Parish.</p>
               <p>That so the multitude of Beggars in <hi>England</hi> may

               <p>That the wages of Servants now trebled more then

those that were Instrumental in the preservation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

Termes convertible, and the Divels <hi>Registers</hi> have not
precedents enough for them, whereby not onely num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berless
&amp; great oppressions are daily exercised upon the
people, to the impoverishing of many of them, by those
that like <hi>Pikes</hi> in the Fish Ponds, do live only better then
others, by devouring and undoing the smaller Frye, and
industriously imploy themselves therein, and at the

same time cry out of injustice and oppression where
it was not, and busied themselves about Religion and
<hi>Gospel</hi> Purity, when they never intended nor could not
afford to practice it, whereby all our <hi>English</hi> Trade and
Manufactures are disparaged and brought into a slight
esteem, and made to be unsaleable, or at very low rates
in the parts beyond the Seas, and to give place to the
Commodities and Manufactures of other Nations more
honestly made, and if not speedily remedied, will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all his Majesties cares of reviving and promoting
the <hi>English</hi> Trade and Merchandise of no avail, as long
as that Canker, or a principal cause of the decay and
ruine of it shall be permitted, may by some good Laws
be restrained and suppressed.</p>
               <p>That the many good propositions heretofore made
by <hi>Mr. Henry Robinson</hi> and some others,<note place="margin">§. 34.</note> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Regulation or bettering of the ways of Trade
and Merchandise, may now after a Committee of Trade
in the times of Usurpation and Confusion, sleeping
too much over it, and doing nothing, whilst Trade it
self came to be almost ruined, be taken into a more
serious consideration, and some good Laws enacted in
pursuance of them.</p>
               <p>That the Manufacture of Linnen Cloth, the importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof from <hi>Flanders</hi> and other Foreign parts,<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
the Nation, little less then 100000 <hi>l, per annum,</hi>
by reason that too many of our Wives in <hi>England</hi>
have exchanged their good Housewisfery for Gallantry,
and <hi>Spinning</hi> for spending, may be more incouraged
in <hi>England</hi> by Injoyning six Acres in every hundred
Acres of errable Land in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> to be yearly
sowed with Hemp &amp; Flex, and that there be an Aulnage
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99831:51"/>
of Linnen Cloth, as well as of Stuffs and Woollen
Cloth.</p>
               <p>That our Laws be not (as too many of them use to
be) <hi>Still Born,</hi>

Laws may be made to prevent or cure their <hi>Swouning</hi> or
<hi>Convulsion</hi> fits, and bring them up to the good ends or
purposes, for which they were ordained, and put them
in execution. That our Paths being restored, we
may rejoyce in our Laws and Constitutions, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
those wandring after <hi>Dark Lanthorns,</hi> or the
<hi>ignis fatuus</hi> of newlights, which have lead us into
many great miseries and confusions.</p>
               <p>That the Excise of Ale,<note place="margin">§. 37.</note> Beer, Perry, and Syder, and
the charges affliction, and troubles, which it brings upon
the people, which before our times of misery, would
have brought death and ruine any private contriver;
and was at the first created by <hi>Oliver</hi> and his <hi>Impes</hi> to
maintain a cursed Rebellion, and set up a destroying
and detestable Anarchy, may be abolished, and taken
away, and the Nation restored to the freedom and
quiet which they formerly enjoyed under this our anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and excellently composed Monarchy.</p>
               <p>That his Majesties Ancient and just Rights of Royal

in the manner of taking of them,<note place="margin">§. 38.</note> may be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, and that
very great Consumption of his Estate, occasioned
by an enhaunce, and trebling of the Rates and
prices of Provision for his Houshould, which hath
laid heavy burdens upon his too small and overmuch
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99831:52"/>
impoverished Revenues, multiplyed his wants and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
disturbed and disparaged the order and honor
of his house, and produced very many great Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
worthy to be remedied by the Parliament, and
the care which they usnally take for the support of his
Imperial Crown and Dignity, may be cured.</p>
               <p>And when a long and generall observation and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
can tell every man, who is not a stranger to his
own affairs, or of other men, how hard a
thing it is for one that is behind hand to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his Povertie and get before hand; how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
it will be for a private man to live out of Debt,
when his yearly and necessary expences and disburse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
shall far surmount his Receipts and Revenues;
how necessary a Treasury, <hi>Banke,</hi> or overplus of money
which is <hi>Robur belli &amp; fundamentum ac firmamentum pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi>
is for a King in times of War, and its many chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
occasions, and the power and reputation of it in times
of Peace to preserve it; and that all Kingdoms and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
never were or could think themselves safe without it.</p>
               <p>That in order to publick good, and to consolidate
the hoped for happiness of King and People, which the
pretended Parliaments of our late Times of Usurpation,
busying themselves in laying Burdens and Taxes upon
the People, for the maintenance of a War, and an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
power, and Tyranny, and the continuance of their
miseries, could never find the way or leisure to establish.</p>
               <p>A Royal and Princely yearly Revenue may be
settled upon his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors; and
to the end to make the Plaister or the Tent proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the wound, and to the cure intended, and not
make the repaires of his Revenues to be insufficient or
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99831:52"/>
more chargeable and burdensome, by doing it by parcels
or at several times, whereby it may ruine, before it can be
repaired, or suddainly after; and for the better satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of some of the Purchasers, who were the cause of their
own and his Majesties troubles and miseries, and of
the Kings Loyal Party who suffered with him in it?</p>
               <p>The highest monethly Assessement or Tax which
in our late times of confusion, was <hi>One hundred and
twenty thousand pounds per mensem,</hi> may by Assesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Subsidies, or some other way proportionable
unto it for the next two years, if the Parliament shall
think fit, be assented unto, and yearly collected and paid
into such hands as they shall appoint, and such part
thereof not exceeding the sum of two hundred thousand
pounds, be destributed by his Majesty, to the suffering
and Loyal <hi>English</hi> who took Armes for him or his
Royal Father, and never deserted their Loyalty;
or to their Wives and Children surviving them, as his
Majesty under his sign Manual shall direct, and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of the said moneys, not exceeding the sum
of <hi>one hundred thousand pounds</hi> arising out of the said
Assessements be imployed for satisfaction, without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
for Interest (which should not be for wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or sinfull contracts) of such Wives and Children
of Purchasers, or the Purchasers of Purchasers, which
have yet received no satisfaction according to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Declarations, by the Bishops, Deanes, and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or Prebends, or out of his Majesty or his Royal
Mother the Queens Revenues, or which have not been
Purchasers by false <hi>Debenturs;</hi> and the other remaining
undisposed moneys as aforesaid, of the said two years
Taxe, to be and remain to his Majesty, his Heirs
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99831:53"/>
and Successors, as a sacred Patrimony unalienable to
be annexed, inseparably to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> not
to be Leased or Rent charged, further then for one or
two Lives, or one and twenty years.</p>
               <p>That after the end of five years next ensuing, there
be another monthly Tax or Subsidy of 120000 <hi>l.</hi> more
for two whole years then next ensuing, to be raised as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid,
and disposed of by such as the Parliament shall
appoint for his Majesties use, of which, if his Majesty
shall please, there may also be issued by Warrant under
his Majesties sign Manual, such moneys as his Majesty
shall think fitting, not exceeding the sum of two hundred
thousand pounds, to be imployed for the further relief
of such of the Loyal suffering party in <hi>England</hi> for his
Majesty, or his late Royal Father, as his Majesty shall
appoint, and that the residue of the monys to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
and raised by the said monethly Tax or Assesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for two whole years be, as soon as conveniently it
may, laid out and disposed for the purchasing of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
Revenue in Land for the King &amp; his Successors
unalienable as aforesaid, and to no other use or purpose,
which they that could pay as much, and a great deal
more to uphold a <hi>Slavery,</hi> may be better contented to
pay, to establish a <hi>redemption</hi> and freedom.</p>
               <p>And that after the end of three years next after the
said two years, there be a like monethly Tax gathered
and collected for two whole years next ensuing, to be
disposed of by such as the Parliament shall appoint, for
the buying of an honorable and Princely Revenue in
Lands of inheritance for the King and his Heirs and
Successors, never to be aliend from the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
other then as aforesaid. And although it may
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99831:53"/>
seem to be a great sum of mony in the Total, to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
out of the people, yet it being the more prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and easie way, and a great deal more necessary
then what hath been done for worser ends and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and being to be born by so many Cities, Towns,
Counties, and people as are to contribute thereunto in
several yeers, and with several respirations, will the eby
not onely free them from many of the like publike
Taxes and Assessements hereafter, and save them in their
purses and estates, as much or more then that will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
unto, by some good Laws and provisions to be
made for the freeing of them from many of the grip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and oppressions of one another, but entail our
happiness and a greater then formerly freedom, quiet
and safety upon themselves and their posterity.</p>
               <p>For there was, is, and ever will be, a necessity of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
strength, and riches to be in a King that intends ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to protect or make happy himself and his people, as
well as to have their love and affection; and though
<hi>David</hi> when he was in his private condition, could
before he was King of <hi>Israel</hi> rescue a Lamb of his flock,
slay a Lyon and a Bear, and with a sling and a peeble
stone kill the dreadful <hi>Goliah;</hi> and that <hi>Nathan</hi> the
Prophet (no flatterer but a man of God) had after
he was a King, said unto him, <hi>The Lord is with thee,</hi> and
brought him a message from God, that <hi>His house, and
Kingdom, and throne should be established for ever,</hi> yet
neither he, nor his subjects the men of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
could believe him or themselves to be in any
condition of safety without his mighty men of war,
<hi>Militia,</hi> Captaines of thousands, and Captains o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hundreds; nor did son <hi>Solomon</hi> after God had
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99831:54"/>
given him a large and understanding heart, and a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of wisdom beyond that which ever was granted to
mankind, with a promise likewise of riches and honor,
suppose it to be any policy, to neglect his Tributes and
Presents, the improvement and well ordering of his
Revenues, and putting an honorable order in his hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
to build Cities of Store, and Cities for his Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots,
and Cities for his Horsemen, and a Navy of Ships
in <hi>Ezion Geber,</hi> and send them to <hi>Ophir</hi> to fetch Gold.</p>
               <p>Nor can it be certainly for the good and safety of
the people to do by their earthly King, who untied the
chains and fetters of their <hi>folly,</hi> restored them to their
Laws and Liberties, and, as a balm of <hi>Gilead,</hi> cured and
healed the wounds of those that never could do it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>Nor accord well with their gratitude, or the many
protestations and promises which they made of sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
their lives and fortunes, and all that they had in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to his happiness.</p>
               <p>Or with the repentance and satisfaction (which makes
repentance efficacious) of those that were the causes of
his twelve years misery and affliction, greater, longer,
and sharper then any of his own hundred and eight Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Progenitors ever endured, enough to have turned
his youth into the gray hairs and infirmities of an old
and decrepit age.</p>
               <p>To doe by him as they doe by their heavenly King,
take, get, and receive all they can from him, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
as little as they may for it, or by the earth their
common feeder and nourisher in their lifetimes, and the
receiver and entertainer of them at their deaths, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
furrows on her back, and enforcing it to serve all
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99831:54"/>
their designs and business; and for all her fruits and
kindness, doe not so well by her as the Heathen, who
could sacrifice to <hi>Tellus</hi> and <hi>Ceres,</hi> but think they do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
if in the moneths of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> they shall be
pleased to admire her beauty, and beat Harvest well
contented to fill their Barns with her bounty.</p>
               <p>And will be as likely to be for their good, as for
children to have their parents so poor and impotent, as
not to be able to protect them, or for those that are to
go a Sea Voyage, to have the ships ill or not at all
victualled, or to adventure in a War or Garrison, when
the Commander in chief, or the General, upon whose
wisdom, valour, strength, and conduct the safety of all
dependeth, shall be every day to seek for victuals to
feed them or himself, Ammunition or Weapons to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
and mony to pay them.</p>
               <p>Unless they could be assured by no doubting Oracle,
that it would be for the good, honor, peace and plenty of
the Kingdom to have the head, faim, languish, &amp; want its
necessary support &amp; Food, and that the members in the
body natural although never so warmely clad, or made
much of, can thrive whilst the Head is sick and infirme.</p>
               <p>Or unless they would be as wise as the Citizens of
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> who rather then they would impart
any of their Riches to their Emperor for the most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
defence of their City, Estates, and Religion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Turk</hi> when their City was besieged by him,
would reserve it for a prey to their enemies, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
slavery for themselves and their posterities, or
as our late men of <hi>Reformation,</hi> and murmerers at their
own happiness, did in their complaints, and taking away
Ship-money, and exchanging it for more miseries then
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99831:55"/>
ever any of their Ancestors endured, when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they were enforced to call their slavery a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and to pay and pray, and give God thanks for it.</p>
               <p>When as the great charge of Government in times
of peace, and the quietest imaginable, and the
necessity of the peoples Aids and Taxes to support
it may the better be believed, when <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi>
notwithstanding the enjoyment and full possession
of the Empire, or greatest part of the world, with
the riches and spoils thereof laid up in the publike
Treasuries and their Capitol, enough (besides what
<hi>Julius Caesar</hi> had in the civil Wars consumed) to make
it the greatest that ever was together at one time above
ground; and his great frugality and care in managing
his Revenue, by keeping a book or memorials, as <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi>
saith, wherein <hi>Opes publica continebantur quantum
Civium sociorumque in armis quot classes Regna Provinciae
Tributa vectigalia &amp; necessitates ac largitiones,</hi> and had
as <hi>Bodin</hi> saith, received <hi>Immanem pecuniarum summam
ex Testamentis,</hi> great Estates of Inheritance from those
very many that made him their Heir, could not subsist
without Tributes and Taxes, but though the bloody
and expenceful <hi>Bellona</hi> was laid to sleep, and there was
nothing likely to disturb that happy and grateful calm
of peace with which the world was then blessed found a
necessity to Tax all the world, and even <hi>Joseph</hi> with
<hi>Mary</hi> the mother of the Redeemer of it, must go up to
<hi>Bethlehem</hi> to be taxed and pay Poll-mony, and for all
that with all his care and providence in governing that
Empire, having spent two paternal Patrimonies <hi>cete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasque
hereditates in Rempublicam,</hi> and much of his
own Estate upon the Commonwealth, left but a small
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99831:55"/>
and inconsiderable Revenue to his heir.</p>
               <p>And when as the King by his inestimable charges,
great and daily expences for the protection and good of
his people, and necessary maintenance of his Royal
Dignity, is in a worse condition then any of his Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or Gentry, who may when their necessities en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
them strike sail if they please, and measure their
expences by their Estates.</p>
               <p>Because he cannot defend himself without defending
his people, must do like a Prince, and live like a Prince,
and it cannot be for the good, safety, and honor of them
that he should either live or do otherwise.</p>
               <p>But should rather believe as King <hi>James</hi> the fifth, in
<hi>Anno</hi> 1540. his Majesties great Grandfather did, when
in a preamble to an Act of Parliament in <hi>Scotland</hi> for
the annexation of Lands inseparable to the Crown, he
did declare, that it <hi>Was understood and weill advisedly
considered be the Kingis grace, and the Estates of his
Realm beand assembled in Parlement, that the patrimony
of his Crown and Revenues thereof beand angmented is
the great weill and profit baith to the Kingis Grace and his
Leiges;</hi> and that King <hi>James</hi> the sixth, his Majesties
Grandfather, and his Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> in <hi>Anno
1600.</hi> did not erre in the preamble of an Act, <hi>Of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexation
of forefaulted Lands and others to the Crown,</hi>
wherein they did declare, <hi>That it is clearly understand
by the Kings Majesty and Estates of the Realm, that the
augmentation of the patrimony and Revenues of the
Crown, not onely serves for the forth setting and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of his Highness Honor and Royall Estate, but alsore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
greatly his Subjects of divers charges and heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</hi>
And when after his coming to enjoy the Crown
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99831:56"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> he did in his Declaration in the year 1619.
Declaring what things he would be moved to grant
to his servants and suitors by way of bounty, and what
he would not signifie his <hi>desire not to cast himself and his
posterity into these wants or straits which might drive them
to lay burdens on the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor should the people of this nobler and better na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
Nation, who have in the times of Monarchy
been blest with a greater freedom then <hi>France, Spain,
Holland, Venice,</hi> or any Christian or Heathen people,
or Kingdom were ever owners of, be unwilling to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
as much of their care and well wishes in setling the
Kings Revenue, now so much weakened by age and
kindness, and ruined for want of repairs, and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
will be but to help to protect and defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as they usually and commonly do in the repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and building a new their owne houses, amending or
making new their Clothes when they perceive them to
decay, or refreshing or bringing to heart again their
Lands which by doing them good have needed it.</p>
               <p>When as those who contrived and assented unto <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
Instrument of <hi>Government,</hi> as it was called, who was
one of the greatest of Villians and Tyrants in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world, and not only murdered his King, but did
all he could to destroy the Bodies, Estates, and Souls of
his good people, did more resemble <hi>Antichrist</hi> then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Turke,</hi> highly deserve a burying place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Gallows, &amp; all that Ignomany could devise to lay
upon him, and was of neither Royal or Noble Birth or
breeding, and could be well contented to allow him Ten
thousand Horse &amp; Dragoons, &amp; twenty thousand Foot,
and the Navy to be maintained by a constant yearly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99831:56"/>
to be raised for that purpose, with the remainder of
the Kings, Queens, and Princes Revenues, not disposed of
(except Forests and Chases, and the Mannors thereunto
belonging) all the Lands of Delinquents in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in
the Counties of <hi>Dublin, Kildare, Clare</hi> and <hi>Katerlaugh,</hi>
the forfeited Lands in <hi>Scotland</hi> (which were great and
considerable) the two parts of Recusants Lands in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
not compounded for, and all Debts, Fines, Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Issues, and Casual Profits belonging to the Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> so miscalled, with two
hundred thousand pounds <hi>per annum</hi> yearly Revenue,
for the Administration of Justice and charge of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to be and remain to that <hi>Minotaure</hi> or Protector,
so called, and his successors, and the Framers of that
which was called the Petition and Advice, could after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in the year 1656. by a fancied Authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
not onely confirm unto him that Revenue in
Land setled upon him, with the Casual profits belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> but intreat him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of <hi>ten hundred thousand</hi> pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> yearly
Revenue, to be raised upon the people without a Land
Tax for the maintenance of the Army and Navy, with
such other supplies, as should be needful to be raised from
time to time by consent of Parliament, and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand pounds <hi>per annum</hi> in like manner to be
raised for his support of the Government.</p>
               <p>Need not repine or think that, or a greater Revenue
to be too much for the highest born Prince in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the Heir of a Succession of Kings for more
then one thousand years last past; who could suffer their
Regal Power and Authority so to be bound with the
Cords of love to their people and the rules of right
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99831:57"/>
reason, as the Sun in all his Travails hath never yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
a people enjoying better or so good Laws, and
Liberties, and less Taxed or burdened with their Princes
occasions.</p>
               <p>And when as there is not any City or Town Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
in <hi>England,</hi> but have received and enjoyed their
Charters and Liberties from the King or his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors,
not any of the Nobility or Gentry, but have
had their honors, priviledges and dignities, and all
or some of their Lands and Estates from them; nor
any kinred or family in <hi>England,</hi> which either by him
or some of his famous Progenitors, or the many <hi>Josephs</hi>
and <hi>Mordecai's</hi> in every age advanced by them, have
not mediately or immediately been preferred and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
and had all that they have or enjoy by their
bounty and munificence, or had much kindness or
Royal favors shewed unto them, and like the lesser
Trees or Shrubs in the Forest, have comfortably grown
up and been protected and shadowed by <hi>Druinas</hi> Royal
Oak, for which in the care of their own good and saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which are involved in his, they are as their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were, more then ordinarily obliged by those eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Bonds of gratitude, which time or adversity should
never be able to break or obliterate, to contribute all
they can to his wellfare, and this our once most famous
Monarchy.</p>
               <p>That so our <hi>Hercules</hi> may not want his Club to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
Himself and his people, that the cry of Debts and
people wanting their mony, being the worst of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes
