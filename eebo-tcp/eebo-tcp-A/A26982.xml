         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SUppoſing the Book which I anſwer as injurious to you, as to me, I judge it meet to propoſe to you this Opportunity of your own Vindication: Or if I be herein mistaken, to crave your help for my own Conviction. Your former Accuſation of ſuch as I, of the heinous Sin of Schiſm, or Separation, I confeſs I anſwered in a manner that required your Patience: If it was too free, and provoking, I beg your pardon, and do not Juſtifie it. My Reaſons were, 1. That I thought, that to take ſuch as I for Schiſmaticks, or Separatists, was a great hardening and ſtrengthening of the real Separatiſts, when my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and ſuch others, ſhould ſeem to be theirs; and if we were falſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, they ſhould ſeem to be ſo too.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe I knew how much your Authority, and just Reputation, would add, as a Whet-ſtone, to the keenneſs of their Zeal who thought us unmeet to live out of the common Goals.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe I knew (whatever is ſaid against it) how great a Loſs it would be to Souls, to have all ſilenced Ministers give over preaching to any more than four; and what Sacrilege we ſhould be guilty of, to give over our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, which we were vowed to, and to be baniſhed five Miles from all Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, or there to avoid all publick worſhiping of God.</p>
            <p>And your Pacificatory Accommodation, ſo earneſtly reſtraining Parents (without excepting the Nobility) from chuſing School-maſters for their own Children, ſeemed to one to be an unſufferable Overthrow of that <hi>Family Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> which is of Divine Inſtitution, antecedent to <hi>Regal,</hi> and moſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally required in the Fifth Commandment.</p>
            <p>Theſe Reaſons carrying me to Earneſtneſs, I perceive the Conceit or Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is too common, that your Exaſperation was the Spring both of Dr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice's</hi> Defence of you, and of this Book, which is commonly famed to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Mr. <hi>Long</hi> of <hi>Exeter,</hi> a Member of the Repreſentative Church of <hi>England,</hi> (of whom I will not ſay, as Biſhop <hi>Morley</hi> of me, <hi>Ex uno omnes.)</hi> This Concest is increaſed by the Title of his Book, the ſame with yours, as <hi>The Second Part;</hi> and by your <hi>Collocutor's Title, [The Army-Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain;]</hi> and ſuch other Circumstances.</p>
            <p>For my part, I take it for my duty to believe, that you abhor ſuch a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of malicious, impudent Lyes: And that he that hath written ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Books (of which, I thankfully acknowledge the Receipt of many, as your Gift) will by no Temptation be poyſoned to the Approbation of ſo venomous a Label.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60957:3"/>But if I ſhould be in any part mistaken, and while you own not the <hi>manner</hi> of his Writing, you ſhould own the <hi>main Cauſe,</hi> or <hi>Accuſation,</hi> I humbly and earnestly beg, that before I dye (if it may be) you will afford me that help of Conviction and Repentance which may be expected from a Man of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Piety and Truth, and the now Biſhop of that Dioceſs where the ſurviving part of my only Flock (that ever I had) remain; among whom you may learn more of the falſhood of this Man's Accuſations.</p>
            <p>And as I cannot but think, that the <hi>preſent Neceſſity</hi> (brought about by God's Providence, without us) will engage a Man of your Knowledge and Temper to uſe your Interest and Parts to the uttermost, both in Parliament and Convocation, for the ſtrengthening of this Nation and Church by Concord and neceſſary Amendment, and unlocking the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <opener>
               <salute>Reverend SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I am a ſtranger to your perſon, but not to your Excellent Writings, for which I praiſe God, and give you my hearty thanks; I have many, I have read many, I have given away, and recommended many to others to read, and I bleſs God have received much light and warmth from many of them, whereby I am engaged to pray for you, and to take all occaſions to ſpeak, write, and act, whatſoever may tend to your good here, and hereafter. And to that end, I cannot be at peace with my ſelf until I have deſir'd you to take into your ſerious dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts how you have walk'd towards the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in your Practice and your Writings, that, before you appear at Gods Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, you may foreſee your Sentence what it will be, and whether your Writings, and Practice have done, or are likely after your death, to do more Good, or Evil to the Profeſſors of the Chriſtian Religion; for this is generally ſaid by many of your Friends concerning your Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, <hi>Ubi benè nemo melius; ubi malè nemo pejus.</hi> And for your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they are generally ſo prejudiced with your <hi>Malè,</hi> that they are not able to read, or think, or ſpeak well of your <hi>Benè,</hi> but diſcourage many good Souls from reading, or minding your moſt profitable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes. Now my humble ſuit to you is to conſider, whether, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> that great Light, and voluminous Writer Crowned all his Works with his Retractations of what was amiſs, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> might not do the ſame to Gods Glory, the eſtabliſhing of good Chriſtians in the Truth, bringing the miſled out of their Errors; ſtopping the Mouths of your Enemies, and cauſing your Perſon and good Works to be had in Everlaſting Remembrance, and the preventing the ill conſequences of what has been acted and writ by you, which may attend the Church of God for many Ages after your death. Sir, I doubt not but you have heard, and read the dreadful things that you are charged withal, I have been amazed at them, and heartily ſorry for them. I beſeech you conſult ſome Religious, Wiſe, Faithful Perſon whom you know to be a true Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (as no doubt there are ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſo many learned Biſhops and Paſtors) and deſire them freely to deal with you in helping you to ſee the great Errata's of your Sarcaſtical Writings againſt the Biſhops and Clergy of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> or
<pb facs="tcp:60957:4"/>
take but that one Book call'd, <hi>The Unreaſonableneſs of Separation, the Second Part,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with ſpecial Remarks on the Life and Actions of Mr.</hi> R. Baxter, 1681. and let God and Men ſee that you cannot only write well of Humility, Repentance, and Self-denial, but you can act them alſo. Where a Croſs in time of Plagues is upon the Door, every Man that paſſes by is ready to pray, <hi>Lord have mercy on that Family:</hi> Sir, if you with your own Hand would pleaſe to acknowledge which of your Works is Infectious and may hurt Souls, all Men that read it, would bleſs God for you, and heartily ſend up their Prayers to Heaven (if they be but Perſons that ever frequent the Throne of Grace) with a <hi>Domine Miſerere R. B.</hi> wherefore I beſeech you think of the advice of a mean Brother of yours in the Work of the Miniſtry, who in real grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for the benefit he has received by your Works, and for your own Comfort, Honour, and Happineſs, and Gods Glory above all, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes, before he goes to his Grave, to expreſs his Love and Duty to you before you go to yours, for he finds that you and we both entred into the Church of Chriſt, <hi>March</hi> 12. 1614 and therefore cannot be long from appearing before Almighty God to receive a Sentence to an Eternal ſtate.</p>
            <q>Liberavi animam meam. Deus Omnipotens dirigat Te in omnibus viis tuis.</q>
            <p>Many years paſt I met with an Expreſſion in a Preface to another Mans Writing, with your Name to it, which much troubled me that it ſhould fall from that Pen which had writ ſuch Excellent Helps to follow Chriſt Jeſus his Rules and Example. It was this; You was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Hell, and the Government and Order among Devils, and clapt in that common Pulpit-prayer Expreſſion concerning the Miniſtry of the Church of <hi>England, viz. By what Names or Titles ſoever Dignified or Diſtinguiſhed,</hi> which I thought one of the bittereſt unchriſtian Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I ever read; and I was heartily troubled to read it, becauſe I thought it impoſſible for Hell to have crouded it in where there was ſo much of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Sir, You have the beſt Prayers I can put up to God for you, and humbly beg your Prayers that I may follow <hi>Paul</hi>'s advice to <hi>Timothy,</hi> in taking heed to my Self and Doctrine, and continue therein, that (tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Gods Mercy and Chriſts Merits) my own Soul may be ſaved and theirs that hear me.</p>
            <p>So, I hope we ſhall meet in Heaven, for we have an Advocate with the Father.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO Mr. <hi>Cantianus D Minimis</hi> Salutem.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>§ 1. I unfeignedly thank you for your Invitation to Repentance. O pray for me that neither Ignorance, nor Prepoſſeſſion and Prejudice, keep me in Impenitency, ſo near my Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I daily wait for my laſt day on Earth, and it is dreadful to die in the guilt of Impenitence: But who knoweth all his ſecret faults? I hope God will accept my willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to know them, and openly to confeſs them what Party or Perſon ſoever be diſpleaſed with it.</p>
            <p>Upon your Letter I began to practiſe it, and finding the Book which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to, begin with my Childhood and Youth in his Accuſations, I thought my Anſwer muſt follow him, and begin there alſo. But ſhewing it to a Friend more prudent than my ſelf, he diſliked it, that I ſhould tell the World of my Childiſh ſins, when it is <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> that are my Charge by the Accuſer. And I have oft heard, <hi>bis pueri ſenes,</hi> as if ſuch paſſages were the effects of aged weakneſs, which better remembereth the paſſages of Youth, than of later years. I ſuſpect that this is true: And yet a dying Man is afraid of ſuch prudence as would ſtifle penitent Confeſſion, when I am ſo loudly called to it by you and the Accuſer: I will therefore ſatisfie <hi>Him,</hi> and <hi>You,</hi> and <hi>ſuch other,</hi> and my <hi>Conſcience,</hi> though I bear the deriſion of prudent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likers: It wrongeth no Man; and to be accounted weak and ſimple I can eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bear.</p>
            <p>§ 2. But I doubt it is confeſſing too little and not <hi>too much</hi> that you will blame me for: And I cannot remedy that neither. Your Liturgy denieth Chriſtian Burial, to all that <hi>kill themſelves;</hi> and it is no Virtue to belie our ſelves, I am ſure it is ſin to belie a Neighbour, whom I muſt love but as my ſelf: Yea or not (ſeaſonably) to vindicate his Reputation againſt malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Slanderers. I have many years left the Book unanſwered, to which you refer me for the Confeſſion of my ſins, though many told me, it was my Duty to anſwer it. It is you now that have call'd me to it. Would you have me
<pb facs="tcp:60957:5"/>
confeſs all that he falſly accuſeth me of? Then you would make your ſelf guilty of all his Lies, by preſuming that they are true, and judging before you ever heard the defence of the accuſed: You write too honeſtly to allow me to judge ſo hardly of you.</p>
            <p>But truely I durſt not put by your Call to my neceſſary defence. The chief reaſon is, that as you doubt whether my Books will do more <hi>good</hi> or <hi>hurt,</hi> and your Author thinks it would be good that <hi>They were all burnt,</hi> and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts are of the ſame mind; ſo I am fully perſwaded is the Devil: And till he can get the Conquering Papiſts or <hi>Tories</hi> to do it, he will Endeavour to make them as uſeleſs as if they were burnt, by rendering them odious for their own faults and for mine. And you tell me that <hi>my Enemies will not read them.</hi> Now till my Opinion of them be the ſame with theirs, you cannot expect that I that have ſpent ſo great a part of above Seventy five years in writing above an hundred and twenty Books, ſhould be content to loſe my Labour and End, and that all Men loſe the benefit of them, rather than I ſhall confute a moſt impudent Liar. If you ſay, I over-value them, why do <hi>you</hi> ſpeak the <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing of many of them.</hi> That is good that doth Good: About Twelve of them are Tranſlated into the <hi>German</hi> Tongue; and the <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſay They have done good. Some are Tranſlated into <hi>French:</hi> One into the Language of the <hi>New-England Americans</hi> by Mr. <hi>Eliots.</hi> Multitudes ſay, they have been the means of their Converſion, and more of their Information, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation and Conſolation. And the Chief benefit that I expect by them to the World is when I am dead and gone. And can you expect that after ſo much labour for the Church and Souls, I ſhould ſo far deſpiſe both it and them, as not to think all worthy of a juſt defence?</p>
            <p>§ 3. But you think that the way of <hi>Confeſſing</hi> his <hi>Accuſations</hi> will better do it, and will make Men write on the Doors, a <hi>Domine Miſerere</hi> for my Soul. But have <hi>you</hi> known me better than I have known my ſelf? Or did <hi>he</hi> know me better, who I ſuppoſe never ſpake with me, but hath lived two hundred (and lately and hundred) Miles from me? Or is there no way to win the love of your Party, but by my known confeſſing ſuch a multitude of ſhameleſs Lies, as an Iriſh Tory or a Pagan would abhor? I think it enough that I have, to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my Conſcience and ſuch as you, expoſed my ſelf to the Cenſure of imprudent weakneſs by my Confeſſions.</p>
            <p>§ 4. But as to my Account of my Opinion about the Wars, I muſt intreat you to take it as it is given you: Not as a peremptory juſtification of all that I did, but as the reaſons which yet I ſee not anſwered, deſiring that where I erre God will better inform me; that I may neither, condemn the juſt, nor juſtifie any ſin.</p>
            <p>§ 5. But beſides your <hi>Authors Accuſations,</hi> you have added two hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ones of your own. 1. That <hi>before ſome Book of anothers, ſpeaking of Order among Devils</hi> I clapt in that Expreſſion, <hi>By what Names or Titles ſoever Dignified or Diſtinguiſhed:</hi> And you did not think <hi>Hell could have done the like;</hi> becauſe it is a <hi>common Pulpit Expreſſion.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60957:5"/>I fear that you are over-tender of your Parties honour, to ſome degree of melancholy ſuſpiciouſneſs, that could find ſo much of Hell in thoſe words. I think I have not heard thoſe words in the Pulpit thrice (to my remembrance) in forty years.</p>
            <p>Our Preachers that I have heard, mention only Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and the Inferiour Clergy. I hope you pray for more than <hi>England:</hi> But what Obligation you have to pray for the Three Patriarchs of <hi>Antioch,</hi> the Two Patriarchs of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or him of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or the Catholick of <hi>Armenia,</hi> or the <hi>Abuna</hi> of <hi>Abaſſia,</hi> or him of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> or the Pope, or the Cardinals, Prieſts and Deacons, or the Archbiſhop of <hi>Rhemes quâ tales,</hi> as ſo Dignified and Diſtinguiſhed, I know not. Is not a General Prayer for them enough?</p>
            <p>Did <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak the Language of Hell, in calling Devils <hi>Principalities and Powers, and Spiritual Wickedneſs in High Places;</hi> no nor in calling Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan <hi>The God of this World?</hi> And is any Name more tenderly to be uſed than Gods? Is it a wrong to Princes that <hi>Beelzebub</hi> is called The Prince of the Devils, and the Prince that Ruleth in the Air? Doth Scripture uſe Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Language, in calling wicked Rulers GODS? But I gave you not the leaſt cauſe to think that I meant that Devils were Biſhops, or Biſhops Devils: I I ſpake not of Biſhops: And do you not know that Devils are <hi>dignified</hi> and <hi>diſtinguiſhed</hi> in <hi>ſuperiority</hi> by <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Titles?</hi> Why did you not name the Book which I prefaced, that I might examine it? Do you think that I can remember all that I have written before mens Books? <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith truly, that he that hath a Sore or Ulcer, thinks that you hurt him when you touch him not, if he do but think you touch him. <hi>However, Dignities, Dominions,</hi> and <hi>Titles,</hi> being words of Political common uſe, if when we talk of ſpiritual, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly or helliſh Policy, we muſt not uſe the ſame terms as of <hi>Humane</hi> Policy, we muſt deviſe new Languages and Lexicons, and correct the Bible.</p>
            <p>Your ſecond Accuſation of me being my writings againſt the Biſhops and Church of <hi>England,</hi> I muſt ſuppoſe you mean truly, not Biſhops as Biſhops, nor the true Church of <hi>England</hi> as ſuch, or as heretofore: But thoſe Changers that ſince <hi>Laud</hi> have called themſelves the Church. If you ſpeak truth this is your meaning.</p>
            <p>§ 6. And I cannot but think that as your honeſt and kind admonition ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth me to be truly thankful to you, and to renew the tryal of my ways; ſo I am obliged by the ſame principle of Love and Fidelity, humbly to intreat you, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider (if poſſible) without partiality, 1. How you can anſwer the owning of ſuch a Volume of a Lying Slanderers Accuſations, before you hear the defence of the Accuſed. 2. But much more, how you can ſo far countenance the heinous ſins of thoſe that you call the <hi>Church,</hi> as not at all to blame them, and to take it for ſo great a crime to name them, and call men to repentance for them? Can you find ſo much of Hell, in the mention of the <hi>Dignities</hi> and <hi>Diſtinctions</hi> of <hi>Devils,</hi> and yet ſee nothing but blameleſneſs, in the ſilencings of about Two thouſand ſuch Miniſters, ſeizing on the goods, and books, and beds of ſo many
<pb facs="tcp:60957:6"/>
as were ſo uſed; laying many ſo long in common `fails with Rogues; even divers to their death; ruining ſo many hundred godly Families; ſhutting the Church doors againſt ſo many Scholars that were educated and devoted to the Miniſtry; cauſing and continuing the woful diviſions of the Land, to the great weakning of the Church, and hinderances of Piety and Love, and the great advantage of Popery and Forrein Enemies? O how much more of ſuch work have ſome to anſwer for?</p>
            <p>Is <hi>Repentance for feeling and bewailing all this,</hi> ſo great a duty, as you ſuppoſe? and is <hi>committing it and preaching it up, a virtue</hi> not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of? Doth God require us <hi>to mourn and cry for the common evils,</hi> if we will eſcape our ſelves? <hi>Ezek. 9. 4.</hi> and to <hi>mourn for the reproach of the ſolemn Aſſembly, as a burden?</hi> Zeph. 3. 17. and is it now a <hi>heinous crime?</hi> Hath Satan got ſo much right to his <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> that if he uſe but the name of the <hi>Church</hi> for it, they muſt repent as of helliſh evil, that ſo much as blame it, and call men to Repentance? O how hard is it to be impartial?</p>
            <p>§ 7. And when you look back on the Wars, why do you not call them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance (if living) who drew the King from his Parliament to defend Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents by an Army from the due courſe of Legal Juſtice, and to be ruled by ſuch <hi>men of guilt</hi> before and againſt his <hi>Supream Council?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 8. I received once a Letter almoſt like yours from <hi>Serenus Creſſy;</hi> if you were of his Religion, I ſhould leſs wonder at your partiality for the Church, and its crimes, than at the like in a Proteſtant. O how little would it have coſt your Church-men in 1660 and 1661, to have prevented the calamitous and dangerous Diviſions of this Land, and our common dangers thereby, and the hurt that many hundred thouſand Souls have received by it? And how little would it coſt them <hi>yet to prevent the Continuance</hi> of it?</p>
            <p>§ 9. But I that here obey your Call to Repentance, am paſt doubt that by the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>juſt</hi> defence which you have forced or called me to, I ſhall ſeem to the Guilty, and to men of your tenderneſs and partiality, to add yet much more to my offence. For you have referred me to an <hi>Accuſer</hi> of ſuch a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſtile and guilt, as can bear no <hi>true Anſwer</hi> adapted to the matter, but what will ſeem uncivil and too ſharp. It was ill Counſel that was given to one that askt, <hi>How he ſhould have the better of any Adverſary that blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him;</hi> viz. <hi>Speak and do things that are moſt odious, as Perjury, Lying, Perſecution,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and cover them with ſacred Pretences, and then all that accuſe thee will be taken for uncharitable Railers.</hi>] If we will <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our ſelves againſt Slanderers and impudent Lyars, and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confounders, and oppreſſing Perſecutors,</hi> we muſt find ſome other than the common <hi>names,</hi> for ſuch mens ſins, yea <hi>names</hi> that are not <hi>diſgraceful,</hi> and provoke them not to <hi>Repentance,</hi> eſpecially if they are liſted in an Army of <hi>Cruſado's,</hi> where thoſe by the Honour and Power of their Company, take themſelves as fortified, that would be afraid were they aſſaulted in their ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſtate. Every Delinquent thinks all his Crimes are ſecured and garriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Honour of the Army or Body that he is Liſted in. They can bear it
<pb facs="tcp:60957:6"/>
if we call a common <hi>Lay Drunkard,</hi> or <hi>Whoremonger</hi> by his Name; yea if one call a <hi>Godly Man</hi> an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> or a <hi>Peace-maker</hi> a <hi>Schiſmatick.</hi> But he is a Railer that calleth a <hi>Clergy Liar,</hi> or <hi>Perſecutor,</hi> or <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> or a <hi>Betrayer of Souls</hi> by his proper Name. They know not how to Preach, without calling <hi>other Men</hi> to <hi>Repentance,</hi> but to motion <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Repent</hi> of Sins that deſtroy Souls, confound Churches, and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Land, is to enrage them by diſhonouring them, and deſerveth the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt Reproaches, and Revenge.</p>
            <p>§ 10. I think your Author hath greatly wronged Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> now Lord Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> by pretending as his Second to be the Vindicater of his Cauſe; for he hath thereby occaſioned a common conceit, that Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> in revenge for my Defence againſt his Accuſations of Schiſm, did inſtigate (Mr. <hi>Morice</hi> and) this (ſuppoſed) Mr. <hi>Long</hi> to do that which he was loth to own himſelf; But I take my ſelf bound to believe that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port is falſe, while there is no proof of it (no not in his Dialogue with the Army Chaplain,) and while his <hi>Irenicon,</hi> his <hi>Origines Sacrae,</hi> his Treatiſe of <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> &amp;c. his <hi>Church Hiſtory,</hi> and other Writings deſerve ſo well, and his known parts and worth are an honour to the Church: Charity believeth not unproved evil. Far be it from me to think that he approveth of this Mans Lies, (no nor of Mr. <hi>Morice's</hi> miſtakes, yet undefended ſince my Reply, though it was (by one) ſaid <hi>that Book deſerved a Biſhoprick</hi>). He hath truly ſaid in a late Sermon, May 1. Page 9. <q>
                  <hi>The Government of Paſſions is Tyrannical and Boiſterous, uncertain and troubleſom, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver free from doing miſchief to it ſelf or others: The greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Paſſion is Revenge; and yet that is ſo unnatural, ſo full of anxiety and fear of the Conſequents of it; that he that can ſubdue this unruly Paſſion hath more real pleaſure and ſatisfaction in his mind, than he who ſeeks to gratifie it moſt.</hi> And Page 5. <hi>If it be intended for an affront though never ſo little, the brisker Mens Spirits are, and the higher Opinion they have of themſelves, ſo much deeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is preſently made on the mind, and that inflameth the Heart, and puts the Blood and Spirits in motion in order to the returning the affront to him that gave it.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>§ 11. To conclude, I deſire thoſe that have cenſured me for leaving ſuch a Book as the Accuſers ſo many years unanſwered, to accept of ſuch reaſons as theſe of the Drs. for my excuſe: And thoſe that are glad that I have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it at laſt, to thank Mr. <hi>Cantianus</hi> and not me; and thoſe that are offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that I anſwer it now, and in words ſuitable to it, to fear leſt they make his ſin their own, and to conſider that <hi>Truth of Words</hi> lyeth in their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the <hi>Matter</hi> and the <hi>Speakers Mind,</hi> and that <hi>wilful diſagreement</hi> to the <hi>Matter,</hi> is a degree of <hi>Falſhood</hi> or <hi>Deceit.</hi> And them that blame me for confeſſing my youthful and private ſins, I deſire to allow me the excuſe that they allow to a greater Man, St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who gave me his Example of the like, and more: And to imitate <hi>whom you</hi> here invite me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60957:7"/>And I hereby according to your deſire earneſtly intreat the Reverend Clergy Men who judge of my faults as you do, that in Charity they will help to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me of them (but not as Biſhop <hi>Morley,</hi> and the Author of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs have done by multiplied untruths in matter of fact.) But it muſt be ſpeedily, or death will make it come too late.</p>
            <p>§ 12. And as to <hi>Retractations,</hi> I have <hi>here</hi> and <hi>oft already</hi> ſearch'd after and <hi>Retracted</hi> all that I can find amiſs in my Writings as to the <hi>MAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER</hi> or Doctrine: But as for the <hi>MANNER</hi> I dare not wholly juſtifie any one leaf that ever I wrote; nor undertake to correct all that is amiſs: I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did any thing that might not have been better done: Sometime there is diſorder: And ſometime Omiſſions, and oft uncomely Repetitions, and always too much dulneſs and frigidity about high and holy things: And about <hi>leſſer</hi> and <hi>perſonal matters,</hi> I am conſcious that I am oft too ſharp and provoking: But about the heinous ſins of Church Corrupters, Confounders, Dividers, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencers, Perſecutors and Betrayers to a Forreign Juriſdiction, I fear leſt I have ſaid too little, though the guilty hate me for ſaying ſo much.</p>
            <p>Of my Sins known and unknown I daily and earneſtly beg pardon of God, by the Sacrifice, Merits and Interceſſion of my Saviour. God be merciful to me a Sinner.</p>

               <hi>Chap. I.</hi> The Reaſons of the Neceſſity of REPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TANCE.</head>
            <p>§ 1. REPENTANCE is a ſubject ſo ordinarily preached or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of, that I will preſuppoſe the Reader acquainted with the meaning of the word: Only here telling you, 1. That it is not meer ſorrow for having ſinned when the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is paſt, that I mean. 2. Nor a bare wiſh that it had not been done. 3. Nor every ſlight Reſolution to do ſo no more, which time or temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation will ſoon wear off. 4. Nor the actual forſaking of this or that particular ſin. 5. And yet it is not ſo high a degree as a perfection in ſorrowing, hating or forſaking ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But it is ſuch a ſelf-humbling and ſelf-loathing ſenſe of the inward badneſs of our Souls, original and further contracted, privative and poſtive, and of the ſinfulneſs of our Lives by Omiſſions and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, againſt God, our ſelves and others, as proceedeth from a root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Belief of Gods Law, and Goſpel, which Chriſt by his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit maketh effectual, to turn the Soul to the Predominant Love and Choice of God as our God, and Chriſt as our Saviour, and the Holy Ghoſt as our Sanctifier, and of Heavenly Perfection as our higheſt End and Hope, and the revealed will of God as our Rule, holy Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as our Practice, and the Communion of Saints as our deſired Society; with ſo prevalent a hatred and enmity to ſin, that it reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in us, nor live we in any that is inconſiſtent with the ſald pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Love of God and Goodneſs.]</q> This is the Repentance which I here treat of, though lower degrees that bring Men but to a common Humiliation, Confeſſion and Amendment be better than none, and may tend to prevent ſome Judgments of God, and prepare Men for better.</p>
            <p>§ 2. There is great Reaſon that without Repentance, we ſhould not expect Deliverance and Salvation: For,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60957:8"/>1. Without Repentance we continue in the ſin that we ſhould repent of: We have the ſame ſinning Mind, and Will, and Affections, which we had in the acting of the ſin; and therefore are under the ſame cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Guilt: What ſhould elſe fit us for Deliverance and Salvation, more than any wicked Men! He that Repenteth not would do the ſame again and a ain, if he had the ſame Temptations. The Man is not changed: He may as wiſely expect to be ſaved by the change of the Weather, or the reſtraint of a Priſon, or a Watchman, or by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Age, or by want of Money, or by pain and ſickneſs, all which may reſtrain him from ſome ſins, as by an impenitent unchanged heart. And God hateth all the workers of Iniquity.</p>
            <p>§ 3. 2. Repentance is much of the Eſſential Cure of a depraved ſinful Soul: And to be ſaved without Repentance, is to be Cured and not Cured: To be well without health: To be ſaved, and not ſaved.</p>
            <p>§ 4. 3. To be ſaved without Repentance, is to Reconcile the moſt Holy God (not to the Sinner but) to the Sin: Light to Darkneſs; Chriſt and <hi>Belial:</hi> Contrary to the Divine perfection; and the Glory of his Holineſs.</p>
            <p>§ 5. 4. And it is a denying or reproach to the Wiſdom and Juſtice of his Government: What worſe can be ſaid of the moſt unrighteous Kings and Judges, than that they equal not only the juſt and the unjuſt, the good and bad, but even the penitent and the obſtinately impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent? And what an odious ſtate is ſuch a governed Kingdom in?</p>
            <p>§ 6. 5. It is clean contrary to the deſign of Mans Redemption, and the Office, Undertaking and Honour of our Redeemer: He came to deſtroy the works of the Devil, and to ſave his people from their ſins: And how are they ſaved from them that are not Converted from them?</p>
            <p>§ 7. 6. How reaſonable a condition is this to make a miſerable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner free from all his guilt or danger of deſtructive puniſhment, without any purchaſe, price or compenſation of his own, by the meer Merits, and Love, and Bounty of a Saviour, and a merciful God; and this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long and aggravated ſinning, as ſoon as ever he is but converted by Faith and true Repentance. What would you think of ſuch terms of pardon offered by Man, in his leſſer injuries? If one abuſe you, rob you, ſlander you, and you tell him, do but repent and give over, and I will forgive thee, becauſe an Interceſſor hath purchaſed thy forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs] would you think him fit for pardon that refuſed ſuch an offer? Can you for ſhame ſay to God, I will not repent and amend, but yet forgive me. It is an abſurd errour of the Libertines that take Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in order to forgiveneſs to be a Legal burden, and the preaching of it to be no Goſpel preaching? What Law is it but the Goſpel or Law of Grace that giveth pardon on ſuch gentle terms? The firſt Law of Innocency gave no forgiveneſs: The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> as Political gave
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60957:8"/>
temporal pardon, but only for ſome leſſer ſins, and on coſtly burdenſome terms: The Law of Grace made to lapſed Man (<hi>Adam, Noe, Abraham,</hi> and fully by Chriſt incarnate) is it that calleth for Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as the condition of Everlaſting Pardon and Life: Chriſt is a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins.</p>
            <p>§ 8. 7. What would it do but equal Devils and Men, to ſave the Impenitent? And even feign God to allow his rational Creatures to live in a profeſſed VVar againſt himſelf, his Son and Spirit, his Word and Promiſes, and Mercies, and againſt themſelves and one another. He that profeſſeth impenitency for belying or wronging me, bids me look to my ſelf, for he will do it again if he have opportunity and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>§ 9. 8. How contrary is it to Thankfulneſs and Ingenuity, to wiſh to be ſpared in Impenitency, after the purchaſe and tenders of ſo great Mercy? What! Dare you ask leave to ſin again and again, when the pardon of every ſin, is the pardon of the puniſhment in Hell Fire?</p>
            <p>§ 10. How unmeet then are they for Pardon and Salvation that hate Conviction and Reproof, and Rail at him as a Railer at them, that doth but call them to Repentance? That think he heinouſly injureth them that ſheweth them by the cleareſt light of Evidence, that they need Repentance? What is Repentance but the actual healing of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soul? The returning Prodigal when he repenteth cometh to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and then cometh home to his Father: He that was loſt is then found; and he that was dead is made alive: And is he meet for a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians help, that would not be cured, but hateth health? Is this a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and thankful requital for all the wonders of Love and Mercy manifeſted to loſt and miſerable Sinners, in the great work of Mans Redemption? Shall we put Chriſt to be our Accuſer, and to ſay, I came from Heaven, and condeſcended to deepeſt Humiliation, to heal theſe Sinners, and they would not be healed? Without their conſent I was Incarnate, Obeyed, Suffered, Died, and Conquered Death by my Reſurrection: Before they deſired it I gave them the Goſpel, and the offers of Free Grace, and ſent them Meſſengers to beſeech them to be reconciled to God: But it was not meet that I ſhould be <hi>Theirs,</hi> that would not be <hi>Mine,</hi> and <hi>ſave them</hi> that would not conſent to be ſaved: To make them willing, which is a Moral change, I uſed moſt undeniable Reaſons, and Means as Moral Cauſes: I ſet Heaven before them in my Promiſes, and Hell in Threatnings: I convinced them of the Evil of Sin, and of the Miſery of unconverted Sinners, and of the Vanity of all that can be ſet againſt the Mercies and Hopes which I ſet before them, and of all other Remedies without my Grace: And yet unleſs I would by Omnipotency heal them, they would not be healed. However God uſe the way of unreſiſtible Omnipotency on ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and will not be fruſtrate in his Deſign of the Saving of his Elect, nor leave

                  <hi>Sect. 1.</hi> The Author's Profeſſion of his own Repentance.</head>
               <p>§ 1. HE is unfit to profeſs himſelf to be called of God, to call others to Repentance, who is Impenitent himſelf. And what Man hath a louder Call to Repent from God and Man than I my Self? And ſhould I not be truly willing to know my Sin that I may Repent of it, and to confeſs it, bewail it, and forſake it when I know it; Conſcience would tell me that hereby I ſhould aggravate it, beyond all juſt excuſe. Alas, it hath not been ſo ſweet, ſo profitable, or friendly to me, that I ſhould take its part, or be loth to leave it. It hath been worſe to me every day of my Life, than all the Enemies that ever I had in the World: And ſince God taught me effectually to know what Sin is, and what God, and Chriſt, and Grace, and the Hope of Heaven is, and to know my Self, all the Sufferings that ever I have had from Men, from Malice, from Envy, from Perſecutors, from Slanderers, have been next to nothing to me, in compariſon of what in Soul and Body, I ſuffer daily for and by my Self and Sin.</p>
               <p>§ 2. Therefore I humbly and earneſtly beg of that God that is the Hater of Sin and the Father of Lights, that he will not deny me that illuminating convincing Grace, which is needful to make me know the truth of my own Condition, nor that uprightneſs and tenderneſs of Heart, which is neceſſary to my true Humiliation, and that I may not forbear any true Confeſſion, which is neceſſary to my exerciſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and to my Forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p>It is no time for me to deny or extenuate my Sin, when I am waiting daily in pain and languiſhing for my final Doom, at my approaching Change, when I ſhall quit this tranſitory World, and all its Vanities for ever. If I knew nothing (of dangerous and doubtful Conſequence) by my Self, yet am I not thereby juſtified: And how ſmall a matter ſhould it be to me, to be judged and acquit or praiſed by Men; when there is one that Judgeth me (by the final Sentence) even the Lord. The falſe applauſe and praiſe of Men (the miſerable Hypocrites reward) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no Joy to thoſe in Heaven, nor abateth the Miſery of thoſe in Hell. Whether they praiſe or diſpraiſe me, they are all Dying as well as I, and in that day their thoughts periſh: And who that ſeeth a Skull caſt up, doth much care what that Man thought of him while he was alive.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60957:9"/>
Verily, every Man at his beſt Eſtate is altogether Vanity: Ceaſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O my Soul from Man.—</p>
               <p>§ 3. But what! Muſt I, or may I therefore Repent of all that men of divers Minds call me to Repent of? How impoſſible is that? How fooliſh, and how wicked?</p>
               <p>There are above Sixty Books written againſt me, in part or in the main ſcope: And I have written above a Hundred and twenty which muſt needs make work for many mens cenſure. And are all, or moſt Wiſe and Judicious that read and cenſure them?</p>
               <p n="1">I. The Sadduces cenſure me for aſſerting the Life to come, and the Reſurrection.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Somatiſts cenſure me for the aſſerting of the Difference of Spirits from Bodies.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Antitrinitarians cenſure me for ſhewing what Evidence of Trinity in Unity God hath imprinted on the whole frame of Nature and Morality.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Church-diſtracting Hereticators cenſure me, for taking the old Controverſies with the Neſtorians, Eutychians and Monothelites, to be capable of eaſier reconciliation, and gentler handling, than it hath found by ſuch fierce Dividers.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The Arrians and Socinians ſay I judge too hardly of them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Godhead of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The Arminians cenſure me for holding ſpecial Election and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencing Grace.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. The hot Anti-Arminians cenſure me for holding any ſuch free Will and Univerſal Redemption, as <hi>Uſher, Davenant, Preston,</hi> and ſuch other knowing men have defended.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. The Anabaptiſts call me to Repentance for Writing ſo much for Infants Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The Antinomians deeply cenſure me as being againſt Chriſt and free Grace, and aſcribing too much to Man, to Faith, to Work and our own Righteouſneſs, and for detecting their Errours.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The Separatiſts call me to Repentance for ſeparating no further from the Conformiſts than they force us from them, and ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from neceſſary Truth: And for perſwading men to Communion with the Pariſh Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. The Conforming Separatiſts call me to Repentance for not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from all ſave themſelves, and for knowing and owning thoſe to be true Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and faithful Servants of Chriſt, whom they eject.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. <hi>Clement Writer</hi> and the Seekers cenſure me, for aſſerting the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Scripture Verity, as ſealed by the Spirit by Miracles and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; and for maintaining that there is yet continued a true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and true Churches.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60957:10"/>XIII. Mr. <hi>Liford</hi> and ſome others cenſure me for taking the Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Holy Ghoſt, to be fixed Infidels judging Chriſts Miracles to be by the Devil.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Mr. <hi>Henry Dodwell</hi> cenſureth me for not taking the Office of Presbyters to be ſpecified or meaſured and varied by the Will of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop or Ordainer, and not determined by the Inſtitution of Chriſt; and for not denying the Presbyters and Biſhops of all the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to be really Miniſters, and their Churches true Churches) who have not an uninterrupted Succeſſion of Canonical Ordination by Dioceſans as from the days of the Apoſtles, and that they commit not the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt by adminiſtring Sacraments as being but Lay-Men; while he holdeth ſuch as the French to be true Miniſters.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. The Eraſtians cenſure me for vindicating the Power of the Keys and the neceſſity of Miniſterial Church Diſcipline.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. The Independents blame me for being for a National Church; and ſome of them for being againſt their unneceſſary Covenanting terms of Communion, and their giving too much Power to popular Votes.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. The Scots Presbyterians blame me for blaming the Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Covenant; and for being ſo much for a ſuperior ſort of Biſhops or Archbiſhops.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. The Engliſh Dioceſan Enemies to Epiſcopacy, who are for ſetting up but one ſole Biſhop and Church, inſtead of a Thouſand, or many Hundred or many Score, do fiercely accuſe me, as if it were not they but I that am an Enemy to Epiſcopacy and the Church; for deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that Thouſands may not be ejected or kept out, and one only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in each Dioceſs an impoſſible task.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. The factious Sectarian part of the Conformiſts, moſt fiercely and implacably accuſe me, for telling them (after many years patient ſilence) what are the Reaſons that I conform not to their impoſed Oaths, Covenants, Subſcriptions, Declanations and Practices: taking this for an Accuſation of thoſe that do, what I dare not do: And becauſe I give not over Preaching. And ſome of their Writers expect that I falſly accuſe my ſelf of a multitude of heinous Crimes, of which they by pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable lying accuſe me: As if Lying againſt my ſelf were an act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and a means of Pardon, and were not a Sin as well as to bely another.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. The Magiſtrates and Judges who have oft Impriſoned me, and ſeized on all my Goods and Books, and driven me out of the County (with the Biſhop that forbad my Preaching) accuſe me for not ceaſing to Preach (when I have unanſwerably proved that ſo to do would be perſidious Sacriledge againſt my ordination Vow and Calling). And when I blamed the Herodians, Prieſts and Phariſees for ſeeking to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Chriſt, and forbidding his Apoſtles to Preach, they ſaid, I meant the Biſhops that Silenced ſuch as I, and for this ſent me to Priſon, with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60957:10"/>
a Fine of Five hundred Marks: But from the Juſtices of the Seſſions I had the faireſt dealing: For when they kept me under many Hundred Pounds Bonds to the good Behaviour (that I might be at their will to take me up as ſoon as they could find any pretence for an Accuſation) they openly profeſſed that they did it not as a Penalty, and had nothing againſt me, but took me to be Innocent; but the Times being dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, they were to do it for Prevention (that is, By the order of Judge <hi>Jeffreys</hi> and the King.)</p>
               <p>Now if you can tell me what Confeſſion and Repentance that muſt be, which muſt ſatisfie all theſe Accuſers, or elſe which of all theſe Parties it is that I muſt ſatisfie, and how I ſhall know that I ſhall not be guilty of a multitude of groſs Lyes, by the Confeſſions which they require and expect, you will perform a work which to me ſeemeth impoſſible.</p>
               <p>Therefore all that I can do is, to ſearch my Heart and Life with a ſincere willingneſs to know the Truth, and to confeſs to God and Man, ſo much as I can find to be truly ſinful, as far as Men are concerned to know it.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. The Italian and Spaniſh ſort of Papiſts yet deeplier accuſe me than moſt aforeſaid, for denying their pretended Vice-Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing their Heretical and Schiſmatical Errors, and proving that by their Conciliar Religion, they profeſs open Hoſtility to Chriſtian Kings and Magiſtrates. One of them 1661. wrote me a Challenge to make this good (having ſaid ſomewhat of it in my Sermon to the Parliament) which I fully performed: But it hath ever ſince lain unprinted, for want of Licenſe from our Clergy, and Security from the Court.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. The Engliſh Dioceſan ſort who are for an Univerſal or Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, under the Name of General Councils, and a <hi>Collegium Paſtorum</hi> in the intervals governing <hi>per Literas format as,</hi> the Pope being <hi>Principium Unitatis,</hi> and Patriarch of the Weſt, are deep Accuſers of me for denying all ſuch Univerſal and Foreign Juriſdiction, as that which is worſe than the Italian ſort Popery, and would perjure this Land which is oft Sworn againſt it: And for taking the Principles urged by <hi>Grotius</hi> (after his Revolt) to be the French ſort of Popery, and for being againſt that Coalition with ſuch on theſe terms; which ſaid Foreign Juriſdiction is Pleaded for, by Archbiſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> Archbiſhop <hi>Bromhall,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Peter Guning,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Sparrow,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Sam. Parker,</hi> Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> Dr. <hi>Saywell,</hi> Dr. <hi>Beveridge,</hi> and worſe by ſome others: All which by their own expreſs words, with a full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of their opinion, I have written ready for the Preſs, (and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed it at large three days with Biſhop <hi>Guning</hi> in the preſence of his choſen Witneſſes Dr. <hi>Saywell</hi> and Dr. <hi>Beveridge.</hi> But Dr. <hi>Iſaac Barrow</hi> againſt <hi>Thorndike</hi> hath irrefragably confuted all their Pretenſions, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Biſhop <hi>Parker</hi>'s vain Contradiction.</p>

                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:60957:11"/>XXIII. But the great load of the moſt Bloody Accuſations, is heapt up againſt me, by the exaſperated Clergy and Laity, for my calling them to Repentance for the Sins which I ſhall after mention; and they fetch moſt of their Charges from my Actions in the Wars, of which the multitude of Untruths in Matter of Fact which they virulently write and report, I had rather think come from the raſh belief of one another in their exaſperated Faction, than from the rupture of tumifying known<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Lying Malice and Rage.</p>
               <p>But though this vented by Dr. <hi>Stillingfleett</hi>'s nameleſs Second, in the Book called, <hi>The ſecond Part of the Miſchief of Separation,</hi> be that which <hi>Cantianus</hi> maketh my Charge, I think it not ſeaſonable here to deal with it, till I have firſt confeſt my real Faults.</p>

               <head>SECTION 2.</head>
               <p>THough I have more than once Publiſhed the Confeſſion of many of my youthful and later Sins, the renewed loud call of <hi>Accuſers</hi> and of <hi>Approaching Death,</hi> provoketh me to do it again, before I call others to Repentance.</p>
               <p>And I will mention the Sins of my Childhood for a warning to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to avoid the like: And becauſe the Seeds of following Sins are uſually then ſown.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Though from the firſt of my remembrance I liked Religious Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and feared ſinning ſince my Father had talkt to me of God and Sin and the World to come, yet it was many Years before I was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for my Original Sin, or felt much of the need of a Saviour, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Doctrine of the Scripture, but only delighted in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical part: And though my Conſcience troubled me for a Lie to ſcape Danger, it did not always keep me from it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. If the moſt pleaſing Sin be the greateſt, the <hi>Delight</hi> in <hi>feigned Hiſtories</hi> called Romances, was my great, becauſe my moſt <hi>delightful</hi> Sin.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Though my Appetite inclined only to the courſeſt and pooreſt Diet, yet therein I pleaſed it fooliſhly and ſinfully to the utter ruine of my Health: which I the rather mention to bid Parents look to their Childrens Health in the quality and quantity of their Food, as they love their Life and Comforts. My delightful Diet was ſo much in Apples, and Pears, and Plumbs, and Cheeſe that poſſeſt my Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach early with an uncurable exceſſive Flatulency, and my Veins with remedileſs Obſtructions, and bred ſo long and violent a Cough, as that brought me into preſent danger of a <hi>Phthyſis:</hi> To Cure which (after three Years) taking exceſſively Garlick and <hi>flos Sulphuris,</hi> inclined me to ſuch a great long continued Bleeding, as exhauſted my Natural Heat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Strength.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60957:11"/>IV. Though we had great plenty of ſuch Fruit at Home, ſometime with a grudging Conſcience, I ventured over the Hedge to a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Fruit. A Sin that <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf confeſſeth.</p>
               <p n="5">V. I was in a School where one or two Lads corrupted many, by obſcene talk, and immodeſt actions: In which I did not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſown them or rebuke them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but oft too much countenanced them in it: As alſo in fighting and abuſing the weaker, though I was unable thereto my ſelf.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Though I was bred under many meer Readers, and Tipling or Drunken Schoolmaſters and Curates, and ſcarcely heard a Sermon in a long time, till I was about Fourteen years of Age, or then and after none that I felt any profit by, I was not troubled at the loſs, nor at my ignorance and unprofitableneſs.</p>
               <p n="7">VII When it pleaſed God by reading ſome good Books, and by my danger of Sickneſs, about Fifteen years of Age to waken my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I was not ſo obedient to that awakening Call as I ſhould have been: But was oft tempted to my old ſin of pleaſing my Appetite, and had almoſt been drawn away to a covetous love of Gaming at Cards: But God quickly check'd it by an unuſual Providence.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. I was ſtrongly poſſeſt (I think by Pride joyned with a Love of Learning) to have ſetled at the Univerſity till I had attained ſome Eminency of Learning and Titles; but God in great Mercy by Sickneſs and other hinderances ſaved me from that danger, and loſs of time, and bred me up in a more humbling way, and gave me ſome little help of ſafe and pious Countrey Tutors.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Weakneſs keeping me in expectation of Death, and God then having given me a greater ſence of Mans Everlaſting ſtate, and of the differences between Faith and Hypocriſie, Holineſs and a worldly ſtate, I thirſted to win others to the ſame ſenſe and ſtate; and to that End offered my ſelf to Ordination when I was too low for ſo high a Work, both in Learning, and in a methodical knowledge of Theology. And though I was naturally inclined to Logical and Metaphyſical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curateneſs and method, I was too ignorant in Languages and Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and divers parts of Knowledge; had I not been a continual Learner (by Books) while I was a Teacher, I had been a diſhonour to the Sacred Office and Work, and do repent that I made ſuch haſte.</p>
               <p n="10">X. I too raſhly in this Ignorance took the Judgment of the Countrey Miniſters that had been my Helpers, and told me of the Lawfulneſs of Conformity, and believed the Books for Conformity which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded me to read, for the Engliſh frame of Government and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, before I had read impartially what was againſt it, or heard any ſpeak on the other ſide, or had well ſtudied the caſe: And ſo I ſubſcribed ſinfully becauſe temerariouſly: And though I was ſo raſh that I cannot ſay, that I am ſure that I took the Oath of Canonical Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60957:12"/>
(it is ſo long ſince) yet I think I did, becauſe elſe I had not been Ordained. Of this I repent, and beg forgiveneſs for the Merits of Chriſt. (Though I had never been like to have been a Miniſter without it, but had turned to ſome other Calling.)</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Though I know not that ever I broke the Oath of Canonical Obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ever diſobeyed my Ordinary, yet I changed my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the Canons, of which I cannot repent: While I lived a year as a Schoolmaſter my Ordinary commanded me nothing which I diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: When I removed to a Priviledged place (<hi>Bridgnorth</hi>) I was only a Lecturer, and my Ordinary commanded me nothing which I did not: I did read moſt of the Liturgy, and kneel at the Sacrament: And my Ordinary himſelf Baptized without Croſſing, and never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to uſe it, or the Surplice. VVhen I came to <hi>Kidderminster</hi> Biſhop <hi>Thornbury</hi> died, and Biſhop <hi>Prideaux</hi> never gave me any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or Prohibition, I being a meer Lecturer that never had Preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Vicar uſing the Liturgy and Ceremonies. But yet I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>at I did think worſe of that ſort of Dioceſane Government, which puts not down the Parochial Paſtors and Churches than I now do, and theſe Forty years have done: For I think that a <hi>General Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy</hi> over many Churches and Biſhops, is <hi>Jure Divino</hi> an Order ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Apoſtles and Evangeliſts in that part of their Office which as Ordinary muſt continue.</p>
               <p>But I repent not that I renounced that ſort of Dioceſanes who put or keep down all the Parochial Paſtors or Biſhops, and Churches, making them but as Chappels, Parts of a Dioceſs as the loweſt Church, and taking on them the ſole Epiſcopacy of many ſcore or hundred Churches. Nor do I repent of my unanſwered Treatiſe of Epiſcopacy written againſt this ſort.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Though I ever diſliked the Cenſorious and Separating Spirit, that run into Extreams againſt Conformity, yet I Repent that I did no more ſharply reprove it: But becauſe almoſt all the people where I came to preach that were not meer VVorldlings, but ſeemed to be ſeriouſly Religious, were either againſt Conformity, or wiſh'd it removed for the Diviſions which it cauſed, I overmuch valued their Eſteem and Love, becauſe I loved their ſerious piety; and having ſometimes (but very ſeldom) ſpoken againſt the Corruptions of the Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſpecially the <hi>Silencing of Ministers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p n="3">3. I did and do believe that it is commonly agreed that Parliaments have five Eminent Relations. 1. They are <hi>part of the I egiſlative power</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> by the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of the Kingdoms. 2. They are the <hi>Kings Supream Council.</hi> 3.

               <p>1. As <hi>Subjects</hi> they are to <hi>obey.</hi> 2. As <hi>Supream Council</hi> they are to be the <hi>chief Adviſers.</hi> 3.

As they <hi>repreſent the people as far</hi> as they are <hi>Freemen</hi> and not Slaves, they are to <hi>ſecure</hi> their reſerved and natural <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> (in their Lives, Limbs, Wives, Children and Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,) which are not to be taken from them. but by <hi>Conſent</hi> or <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiture.</hi> 5. Their <hi>Legiſlative</hi> power they have not (as <hi>Hooker</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others think by <hi>Nature,</hi> but by that <hi>Fundamental Contract</hi> which made the form of Government: For though <hi>Government</hi> be of <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Genus,</hi> and as empowered and obliged primarily to promote obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Gods own Laws; yet it is <hi>of Man</hi> by <hi>Contract,</hi> that the <hi>Perſons</hi> or <hi>Families,</hi> or <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of Rulers be conſtituted, and reſtraint put on the Invaſion of Propriety.</p>

                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:60957:14"/>4. I did and do believe <hi>Grotius, Lawſon,</hi> and other Writers of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who agree, that the <hi>bare Title of Supream</hi> given to a King, is no proof that the whole Soveraignty (<hi>ſumma poteſtas</hi>) or <hi>Legiſlation</hi> in particular, is in <hi>him alone,</hi> and not at all in the Senate or Parliament; for it is for Unity ſake, <hi>Honourary,</hi> not excluding, but implying the Parliaments part, and alſo that he is to exerciſe his Judicatures by the Legal way of his Courts, Judges and Magiſtrates.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I did and do believe that the King is <hi>ſingulis &amp; univerſis ſubditis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor quoad Fus regendi:</hi> and that the people <hi>quâ talis</hi> have no power of publick Government, but that he is not <hi>Univerſis melior:</hi> And that <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liority</hi> maketh the <hi>final Cauſe:</hi> And that <hi>ſalus populi,</hi> or <hi>bonum publicum</hi> is the <hi>Eſſentiating End</hi> or <hi>terminus</hi> of Humane Government: And it is no Government (ſave equivocally) which is <hi>deſtructive</hi> of this <hi>End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. I believe that the ſame God that Inſtituted Political Government, did alſo make, 1. Self-Government. 2. Paternal Government. 3. Marital Government. 4. And Paſtoral Church Government: And that no King hath any Right to null any of theſe, or alter them in Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials or Integrals; but only to <hi>over rule them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. I believe that all Power is of God, and no King hath any but what God hath given him: And that God hath given none againſt himſelf, or any of his own Laws: And all Laws are nullities that are againſt them. And are not Acts of Authority but Uſurpation, (as <hi>Hooker</hi> ſaith.)</p>
               <p n="8">8. But yet he that acteth in one thing without and againſt Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is to be obeyed in other things where he hath Authority, and not reſiſted by Arms in every Uſurpation, yea the Honour of his Office and true Power is to be preſerved, while we refuſe obedience to his ſinful Uſurpation.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Grotius</hi> and common reaſon convinced me that where the <hi>ſumma poteſtas</hi> is in King and <hi>Senate,</hi> each part hath right to defend its own true Part therein: It can be no part in Soveraignty which is meerly at the Will and Mercy of the other part.</p>
               <p n="10">10. I did and do believe that the Conſtitution fixing the chief power in King and Parliament united as one Politick Perſon; it ſuppoſeth that they muſt not be divided: And that neither part hath power againſt the other as ſuch: (The King hath power over them as <hi>Subjects,</hi> but not as <hi>Legiſlators</hi> or <hi>exempted Proprietors.</hi>) So that ſeparating them by fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed oppoſition is diſſolving the Conſtitution: As ſeparating Soul and Body, Husband and Wife, diſſolve Man and Matrimony.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Therefore I did and do believe that neither King nor Parliament had any right, to raiſe an <hi>Offenſive</hi> War againſt each other! None but unavoidably defenſive could be lawful. Therefore the firſt aſſailant was the culpable beginner.</p>
               <p n="12">12. I did believe that neither the King nor the Parliament as ſuch are
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60957:15"/>
queſtionable by Law, having no ſuperior Judicature to try them. And that the perſon of the King is inviolable, there being no Power or Law to puniſh him, and therefore the Law ſaith, The King can do no wrong, but it layeth all the blame on the Subjects, who are reſponſible for their actions.</p>
               <p n="13">13. I did and do believe that as every Man hath a power of private Self-defence againſt a Murderer or Thief, ſo every Kingdom hath a power or right of publick Self-defence, againſt Forreign or Home bred Enemies.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But I believe that this power belongeth not to a wronged or perſecuted party, but only to the Body of the Kingdom: Becauſe their good is not the <hi>bonum publicum,</hi> and a Civil War would do more hurt than their death or ruin. Nor may a Kingdom defend all its Rights, or revenge all its injuries by a Civil War, which will do more hurt than their wrongs: But where the deſtruction of the Kingdom is apparently endeavoured, or the change of their Conſtitution, or a hurt greater than a Civil War, a Self-defence is lawful and neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="15">15. I believe <hi>Grotius</hi> and all Politicks, that <hi>Regere &amp; perdere rempub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licam</hi> are inconſiſtent, and that whoever declareth his purpoſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Kingdom, can be no King of it: For the <hi>terminus</hi> is eſſential to his relation. If it be Murder not to defend the Life of a Brother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the aſſault of a Murdering Robber, it is far worſe not to do our Duty to ſave a Kingdom againſt publick Murderers, and Deſtroyers.</p>
               <p n="16">16. If a King profeſs himſelf a Papiſt according to the true definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he taketh Approved General Councils for the Rule of his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And the Laterane Council <hi>ſub Innoc.</hi> 3. bindeth all Temporal Lords on pain of Excommunication, and Depoſition to exterminate all that deny Tranſubſtantiation and others called Hereticks from their Dominions, if they are able; and other Counſels and Popes have the like. And it muſt be ſuppoſed that he that profeſſeth himſelf ſo bound in Conſcience, is reſolved as ſoon as he can to do it. And he that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth on them a falſe Religion, and faith, <hi>Turn or Die,</hi> profeſſeth to deſtroy or damn them. Yet may he be endured if he diſclaim ſuch Councils, or promiſe Liberty, till Evidence of perilous attempts nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that promiſe: But if he put the Nation under the power of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Judges, Magiſtrates of the ſame profeſſion, it muſt be ſuppoſed that he cannot ſave the Kingdom from them, or that all they will be neglecters of their own Religion: Or if he put himſelf into the power of an Army of that Religion, he puts the Nation into their power, though he were a Proteſtant himſelf: For he is utterly unable to reſiſt their power when Religion engageth their deluded Conſciences to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us: And though cauſleſs fears will not warrant defenſive Arms, rational well-grounded fears will: For when Men are dead it is too late.</p>
               <p n="17">
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:60957:15"/>17. But it followeth not that therefore a Papiſt may be reſiſted in <hi>France, Spain, Portugal,</hi> or any Papiſt Kingdom; nor yet a Heathen by perſecuted Chriſtians, as in the Roman Empire. Becauſe their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion bindeth none of theſe to exterminate or deſtroy their own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, as being of the ſame Religion as themſelves. And the Chriſtians then, and Proteſtants there now are not the Kingdom, but a Party: Therefore King and Parliament have here newly enacted for the ſetling of this Crown, that no Papiſt may be here King or Regent Queen: For though (as in the Pond Judge <hi>Hale</hi> tells us) two Pikes devoured all the other great ſtore of Fiſh, and ſurvived only themſelves) God never au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized one Man to damn or murder a whole Kingdom.</p>

The Intereſt of the King (his Honour, Safety and Power) and the Intereſt of the People (their common ſafety and welfare) are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, but muſt not be oppoſite. The King is for the Kingdom <hi>finaliter</hi> under God's Glory, though the People are as Subjects to obey the King, it is to that end, the common good.</p>
               <p n="19">19. In application, I did believe that both King and Parliament ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully began and managed this War. For if either or both were wronged, ſo much was by them to be endured, as was not worſe than a Civil War. I believe that the Parliament did very ill, in being emboldened by the Scots Army to provoke the King beyond the degree of meer neceſſity. And that it was ill done of thoſe that ſecretly or openly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the Apprentices tumultuous way of Petitioning, to move any Parliament Men from following their Judgments; and in permitting the groſs Scorns and Abuſe of the Biſhops and Liturgy. And I believe that after they did yet worſe, in taking and impoſing the Scots Covenant to procure their help.</p>
               <p n="20">20. I did and do believe that yet they did but their Duty, in ſeeking to redreſs the dangerous Abuſes of Miniſterial Governours, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inſtruments by Legal tryal to Puniſhment: For what purpoſe elſe are they a Judicature? Subjects are all under the Law. And the common Judges are Sworn to do Juſtice, though the King's Seal ſhould be ſent to Prohibit them.</p>
               <p n="21">21. I did believe that the King did ill to forſake them, and on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Tumults to gather an Army in <hi>Yorkshire, Nottingham</hi> and <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and that whoſe Commiſſions ſoever were firſt dated, his Armed Collection of Men was firſt raiſed: But yet that the beginning was by ſuch degrees of mutual Provocation, that to this day it is hard to ſay, who began.</p>
               <p n="22">22. I had read the King's Letter in <hi>Spain</hi> to the Pope, promiſing to venture Crown and Life for the Union of the Chriſtian Churches, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Roman: which is recorded in Mr. <hi>Cheſne</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> his Geographer, and in <hi>Prin</hi> and <hi>Ruſhworth.</hi> And whether it be true or not that the Scots ſay in a Book called <hi>Truths Manifeſt,</hi> that K. <hi>Charles</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:60957:16"/>
then in <hi>Scotland</hi> had poſſeſſion of their <hi>Broad Seal,</hi> and put that Seal to a Commiſſion for the Iriſh Inſurrection, I am paſt doubt that K. <hi>Ch.</hi> II. granted a Commiſſion to <hi>Monk, Mancheſter</hi> and others, to try the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of <hi>Antrim</hi>'s Plea, by which it was proved and determined that he had the K. <hi>Ch.</hi> I's Commiſſion. Though I believe that the King that cauſed them to riſe, allowed them not to Murder all the Proteſtants: Put whom elſe were they to riſe againſt but the Proteſtants? And muſt they riſe againſt them and not kill them? And was not the Murderous temper and uſe of the Iriſh well known?</p>
               <p n="23">23. I know that the Iriſh a year before <hi>Edgehill</hi> Fight, on that day <hi>Oct.</hi> 23. 1641. were to have ſurprized <hi>Dublin:</hi> And by the full Account of Dr. <hi>Henry Jones</hi> ſince Biſhop, and Sir <hi>John Temple,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Orery,</hi> Murdered Two hundred Thouſand, and boaſted that they did it by the King's Commiſſion: and that when they had done there, they would come hither. Though I believed them not, I knew that Two hundred Thouſand men dead are paſt Pleading their own Cauſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending their Country: It is eaſie to Plead the juſtneſs of their Cauſe againſt dead Men that cannot contradict them. <hi>Solitudinem faciunt, &amp; Pacem vocant.</hi> There is no reſiſting Murderers in the Grave: And I thought that if the King put in Arms and Power, the Engliſh Papiſts of the ſame Religion, bound to deſtroy us, his own good meaning could not preſerve himſelf or us. And I knew that the King ſtopt the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Horſes that were ſent by the Parliament to relieve <hi>Ireland,</hi> and took them for his own Service, and many ways delayed their Relief. Though he offered to go over himſelf, the Parliament fearing he would go to Head the Iriſh.</p>
               <p n="24">24. The King had before aſſaulted the Parliament-Houſe in Perſon, with Armed Men, to have ſurprized Five Members and the Lord <hi>Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolton</hi> whom he accuſed: And after fruſtration confeſt it a Breach of their Privileges.</p>
               <p n="25">25. The Money ſent <hi>Dolbier</hi> to buy German Horſes, and other actions, and the Confeſſions of Sir <hi>Jacob Aſtley,</hi> Sir <hi>John Conniers,</hi> Sir <hi>Fulke Haukes</hi> (my Mother-in-laws Brother) <hi>Chidley,</hi> and the other Commanders of the Engliſh Army that were to have been drawn up to <hi>London,</hi> together with the King's putting a Guarding Regiment on them, did put me paſt all doubt that they were devoted to violence, had they not defended themſelves: And no vain Talk to the contrary can make me doubt of it to this day. So that though I think they had done more prudently to avoid War, had they ſpared <hi>Strafford</hi> and <hi>Laud</hi> to pleaſe the King, yet I am fully ſatisfied that afterward they were neceſſitated to ſave themſelves from deſigned Force.</p>
               <p n="26">26. I am certain that two things filled the Parliaments Armies. And both of grand Importance. 1. That all over the Kingdom, ſave here and there a ſober Gentleman, and a formal Clergyman, the Religious
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60957:16"/>
Party and all that loved them, were generally for the Parliament (alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the Perſecutors and Silencers): And the Profane Party in all Countries (Debaucht Gentlemen, Malignant Haters of Piety, the Rabble of Drunkards, Blaſphemers) were generally againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And religious People were loth to herd with ſuch: And could hardly believe that in ſo great a Cauſe God would reveal the Truth to all his Enemies, the ſenſual Rabble, and hide it from the generality of them that fear him: And eſpecially that in moſt Countries the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants forced away the Religious, and either roſe againſt them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or ſet the King's Soldiers to Plunder and Deſtroy them. My own Father living 18 Miles from me was Plundered by the King's Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, though he never ſcrupled Conformity, nor ever medled againſt the King, and was thrice laid in Priſon, and had ſtill lain there, had not Sir <hi>Fulke Haukes</hi> his Brother in Law been by Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> made Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and this for nothing. And after laid in again till the Town was taken. This laſt was only becauſe when they made him Collector for the King, he refuſed to diſtrein of thoſe that paid not (fearing leſt he ſhould be put to repay it).</p>
               <p>And almoſt all the Religious People of <hi>Kederminſter</hi> were forced to fly and leave their Houſes and Trades to their undoing, to ſave their Lives, though they had never medled with Wars. And the men that had no maintenance of their own, were forced to become Gariſon-Soldiers in <hi>Coventry,</hi> to avoid Famine.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing, and the main that drove men to the Parliament Gariſons and Armies, was the Iriſh Murders, with the Papiſts Power with the King: They thought that it muſt be an unuſual War, that ſhould Kill Two hundred Thouſand: As dreadful as it was, I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that all the Wars of <hi>England</hi> Kill'd not Fifty thouſand, nor near it. And though Fear which is a Tyrant, overcame partly their Diſcretion, yet this joyned with the Experience of that which forced them from home, was too ſtrong a tryal for moſt to overcome.</p>
               <p>And it confirmed their Suſpition when the Queen brought in a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Army under General <hi>King,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>'s Army had ſo great a number of Papiſts, and after the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> was autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized to have brought over an Army of Iriſh Papiſts, and the Engliſh Regiments that fought there againſt them, had been called hither to fight againſt the Parliament, and were routed at <hi>Nantwich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No wonder if men thought that <hi>England</hi> would have been made too like to <hi>Ireland</hi> whether the King would or not, had ſuch Armies Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered.</p>
               <p n="27">27. The Parliament Proteſted to be for the King, and not againſt his Perſon, or Legal Power or Prerogative, but only <hi>againſt his Illegal Will,</hi> to defend themſelves and the Kingdom, from an unlawful Army, and to bring Delinquents to Legal Tryal and Puniſhment: And they accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60957:17"/>
gave out all their Commiſſions; till the Cauſe was changed by <hi>fairfax</hi>'s Commiſſion, that left out the King. And the Soldiers of the Gariſon where I was, commonly believed this to be their Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the true Caſe of the War, <hi>viz. Offenſive againſt armed Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents</hi> as the <hi>Sheriff</hi> may raiſe the <hi>Poſſe Comitatus</hi>), and <hi>Defenſive againſt the Kings illegal Will, and Way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28. I did believe that if the King by ſuch an Army as he had, ſhould Conquer the Parliament, the Legal and all Probable Security of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for Life Property, Liberty and Religion, was in all likelihood gone; If it ſhould lye on the King's <hi>Will</hi> only, thereby it were gone: For what then were our Conſtitution, or Parliaments for; and what differ we from Slaves? And were he <hi>willing</hi> (and thoſe with him that meant well) he would not be <hi>able</hi> to Maſter ſuch an Army.</p>
               <p n="29">29. I did believe that if the Parliament were certainly more faulty than they were, the Kingdoms Security was not therefore to be forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Subjects; nor all Parliaments and Government to be left to the Will of the King, who had for ſo many years interrupted Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and diſſolved them ſtill in Diſpleaſure, and had raiſed Taxes called Ship-money by himſelf without them, and on the ſame account might command all the reſt: Therefore I owned not any of the diſcerned Miſcarriages of the Parliament, but only thought I was bound to defend the common Good and Safety, as it was the End of Government. My judgment yet is, That if the King of <hi>England</hi> wrongfully begin a War againſt <hi>France,</hi> the Subjects ought by Arms to help him, not owning his wrong Cauſe, but to ſave the Kingdom, which would be loſt and enſlaved if he were Conquered. So the fault of the Parliament could not diſoblige the People from labouring to ſecure the Conſtitution of the Kingdom, and therein their Poſterities, Properties, Liberties and Safety. And the bare Promiſe of a King is no ſuch Security.</p>
               <p n="30">30. I did believe that if there were a Controverſie in theſe Caſes, the Supream Council and Judicature of the Kingdom, had the moſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Power of Determination to particular Perſons: As the Judgment of a General Council is preferable to any lower Judges, and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the College of Phyſicions is more authoritative than of a ſingle Dr. And the Judgment of the Univerſity is more than of the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Chancellors or one Man. And tho yet it may fall out that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter may be in the right, the unlearned that cannot confidently judge, are more excuſeable for not reſiſting the higher Judges.</p>
               <p n="31">31. Obj. <hi>By this Rule, whatever wrong a Parliament ſhall do to the King, we muſt all take their part againſt him: And if they betray their Truſt, we muſt bear them out in their Treachery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Diſtinguiſh between a wrong to the King, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying of the <hi>Bonum Publicum,</hi> the common Safety and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:60957:17"/>2. And between a Caſe controvertible, and a Caſe clear and certain. And ſo I anſwer, 1. If a Parliament wrong the King, we muſt not joyn with them in wronging him; nor own their wrong; nor defend the Perſons from legal Juſtice. He might have diſſolved them and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led another, had he not paſt a Law to the contrary. He may Impeach any Members at their own Bar: But at what Judicature ſhall he try the higheſt Judicature it ſelf.</p>
               <p>2. And if the Repreſentative would treacherouſly deſtroy the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and yield to enſlave them, or to give up the Kingdom to the Pope or any Foreign Power, the Caſe being paſt Controverſie, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have not thereby loſt the natural Power of Self-defence: But may as lawfully chooſe more truſty Repreſentatives, and fight for Self defence againſt ſuch Traitors, as againſt a Tyrant.</p>
               <p>3. But the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the Conſtitution, (in King and Parliament) muſt ſtill be maintained, and the <hi>Salus Populi</hi> without reſpect to which there is no Government. And no perſonal Faults can forfeit that.</p>
               <p n="32">32. Therefore I ever thought, as it was a diſſolution of the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution for the King to put down Parliaments, and pretend (as Biſhop <hi>Morley</hi> blindly pleadeth) to the ſole Power of Legiſlation; ſo it is Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for a Parliament to put down Monarchy, and to aſſume the ſole Legiſlative Power; As the Rump did when they pretended to ſettle a Government without a King or Houſe of Lords.</p>
               <p>If either King or Parliament perſonal ſhould forfeit their Power, the Kingdom doth not thereby forfeit their right in the conſtituted Form of Government, by a King and Parliament.</p>

               <p>I Have interpoſed this account of the Principles on which I acted; I will next add an account of my Actions hereupon, and then return to the Confeſſion of my own Sins as far as I know them.</p>
               <p>1. Refuſing a Chaplain's Commiſſion, I continued about two Years or more in <hi>Coventry,</hi> as a Lecturer to the Gariſon and City, in quietneſs, ſave that we daily heard of all the diſmal Wars abroad. Only twice I went out with them, 1. To take in <hi>Tamworth</hi> Caſtle that coſt no Blood, 2. And to beſiege <hi>Banbury</hi> Caſtle, whoſe Soldiers rob'd <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> and the Travellers and Carriers on <hi>London</hi> Road. But thence we were raiſed and driven home with ſome loſs.</p>
               <p>Alſo for two or three Months the care of my Native Countrey and of my Father drew me into <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> with ſome that went to ſettle a Gariſon at <hi>Wem:</hi> There and at <hi>Longford</hi> Houſe I ſtaid till my Father was delivered from Impriſonment by Exchange, for a ſhort time.</p>
               <p>2. All that ever I converſt with, did all this while proteſs to own the King, and only to ſeparate him from an Army of Delinquents, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60957:18"/>
to reunite him and his Parliament: And we thought all the Armies had intended no worſe. But when <hi>Naſeby</hi> Fight was paſt, having heard that the King was left out of the New Commiſſions, I went to ſee the Field where the Fight was, and the Army: And there accoſted me ſome ſober honeſt Captains, and told me that their Army was corrupted by the fault of the Miniſters, that had all forſaken them, being weary of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and impatient of the Sectaries in the Army, and ſo they were all left to the Preaching of their own Officers and Souldiers, and a few Chaplains of their own Mind and Choice. And that the bold Leaders began already to ſay, that God hath committed the ſafety of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their truſt; And what were the Lords and Knights in <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror's time, but his Colonels and Captains? In a word, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by them that they had a purpoſe to ſet up themſelves, and to overturn the Government of Church and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. This ſo ſurprized me, that whereas theſe Captains intreated <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> among them, and got Col. <hi>Whalley</hi> (who then ſeemed of their <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>) to invite me to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, I took but one days time to anſwer them. And I opened the ſad Caſe that we were all like to be in, to an Aſſembly of Miniſters in <hi>Coventry,</hi> whom I gathered to counſel me, and told them what I found, and that the Land was now like to fall into their hands: and that though I thought it was too late, I was inclined to venture my life among them in ſeeking to reclaim them. The Miniſters (Dr. <hi>Bryan,</hi> Dr. <hi>Grew,</hi> Mr. <hi>King,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brumskill,</hi> Mr. <hi>Morton,</hi> and others ſeeing my inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gave their conſent: But the Committee (after conſent) refuſing, I was forced to tell them what I ſaw and heard in the Army, and what Danger the Kingdom was in, and ſo to go away againſt their will: But Col. <hi>W. Pureſoy</hi> a Confident of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s, threatened me for ſuch words, and I imagine ſent <hi>Cromwell</hi> word that Night: For the next Morning I was met with ſcorn, and I ſuppoſe all known to <hi>Cromwell</hi> that I had ſaid: and <hi>Cromwell</hi> would never after allow me any opportunity, beyond the Regiment that I joyned to: And there I ſpent near two years in Labours and Diſputings againſt well-meaning perverted Sectaries, if it had been poſſible to have turned them from what they after did. But my capacity was narrow (though there I prevailed with moſt). And I got Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> (ſince of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> that ſuffered much for the King, and after by the King) a great Enemy to Sects and Sedition, to come and help me; but they wearied him away: And beſides Mr. <hi>Bowles,</hi> I know none but perverſe Sectaries, (part Arminians, but moſt Antinomians or worſe) left to be their Teachers.</p>
               <p>I told the Parliament Men what the Army would do, and warned them to prepare: But it was too late: <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his Confederates did all, and made a Stale of <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s Name; and <hi>Vane</hi> and <hi>Haſlerigge</hi> and their Friends in Parliament, disbanded all the ſober Souldiers in Gariſons and Bragades that would have reſiſted them; and ſo put the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60957:18"/>
Power of King, Parliament and Kingdom into their hands, and ſome of them repented when it was too late.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Feb.</hi> 1656/7. they began their Conſpiracy againſt the Parliament in a Meeting at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and that very day God ſeparated me from them by Bleeding 120 Ounces at the Noſe (at <hi>Milborne</hi> in <hi>Derbyſhire</hi>) when elſe I had (in vain) hazarded my life againſt them at <hi>Triploe Heath,</hi> by drawing from them as many as I could. But Sir <hi>Edward Hatley</hi> and other Officers that did it, and drew off about Five thouſand did but ſtrengthen them. For <hi>Cromwell</hi> fill'd up their places with Sectaries and Soldiers that had ſerved the King before, and was ſtronger than before, as having none to diſtruſt.</p>
               <p>To tell what they did after againſt the Eleven Members, and then againſt the Majority of the Parliament, and then againſt the King, and then againſt the Rump, and then againſt the Miniſtry, and how <hi>Cromwell</hi> contrived himſelf into the Supremacy, would be to write the Hiſtory of that time, and to Epitomize <hi>Whitlock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This much I thought neceſſary to premiſe to my own review of my actions, and for them that call me to Repentance, who while they falſly judge of the Hiſtory, can be no true Judges of the Application. I proceed therefore to the exerciſe of Repentance as far as I can know.</p>
            </div>

               <head>SECTION 5.</head>
               <p n="24">XXIV. I Greatly repent that I at <hi>Coventry</hi> took the Scots Covenant, for the many Reaſons which I ſhall hereafter rehearſe. And that once I gave it to one Man, a Papiſt Phyſition who pretended to be converted, and deſired me to give it him: But ſuſpecting his Hypocriſie, I never gave it more, but kept I think Thouſands from taking it in <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire</hi> and elſewhere. I thought at firſt that it was intended only as a Teſt to the Gariſons and Armies, and knew not that it would after be made a dividing teſt for the Magiſtracy, and Miniſtry through the Land: which yet by the tenour of it, I might have underſtood. But I repent not that I neither ſware nor ſubſcribed that no man that ever took it, is obliged by it to that part which is good and neceſſary: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury is no jeſting Matter.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. I more repent that I once publickly defended it againſt a Writing of Sir <hi>Francis Netherſole,</hi> which he wrote againſt Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi> who had Preached for it. And that I did not more impartially conſult with Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> and hear all that he had to ſay againſt it: For he was near us, and I Preacht to him once at <hi>Kenelworth</hi>-Caſtle, where as a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner he was liker the Maſter of that Pleaſant Seat (under Colonel <hi>Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>) for he ſeemed purpoſely to force the Committee to Impriſon him, by conſtant provoking them, who would fain have let him alone: But by that means he ſaved Houſe-keeping, and ſcaped both Plundering
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60957:19"/>
and Sequeſtring on both Sides, and ſecured his Eſtate, and his Perſon in a place of freedom and delight by Water and Land.</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI. And though I thought that a Parliament's Judgment was above all Lawyers, yet I repent that I had not more diligently conſulted Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers on the other ſide: Though indeed I knew not well where to find them, the Lawyers of my Acquaintance being for the Parliament.</p>
               <p n="27">XXVII. And whereas I then thought that <hi>Neutrality</hi> was <hi>a heinous Sin,</hi> to ſtand by in the Danger of the Land; I now <hi>repent of that Opinion;</hi> conſidering that in a caſe of Blood, Men ſhould very clearly be reſolved before they venture on either ſide.</p>
               <p n="28">XXVIII. And I repent that I was by Ignorance, in too much fear of Religion by the danger of Arminianiſm; and thought too hardly of the <hi>Laudian party on that account:</hi> For though I am no Arminian, I have fully proved in my <hi>Catholick Theology,</hi> that the difference is more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal and ſmall, than the Zealots of either ſide do imagine: which Book is yet anſwered by none.</p>
               <p n="29">XXIX. Accordingly, I at <hi>Coventry</hi> engaged in a diſpute againſt Mr. <hi>Cradock,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Diamond,</hi> to prove <hi>Remiſſion of Sin</hi> (not only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional but Actual) to be an <hi>Immediate effect</hi> of Chriſt's Death, and pleaded for it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 32. (and againſt Univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption) which I ſince perceive I miſunderſtood and abuſed.</p>
               <p n="30">XXX. I repent that I ſooner enquired not into the danger that the Land was in by <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his Sectaries: And I repent that when his fundamental Troop at <hi>Cambridge</hi> (which after made Commanders headed his Army) wrote to me with Subſcribed Names to be their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, I refuſed and rejected the offer to their offence, telling them that I was neither for a Military Church nor an Independent popular Church; Had I gone to them then, what might I have prevented?</p>
               <p n="31">XXXI. Though I am not able to ſee, that I did not my Duty (my moſt Self-denying and coſtly Duty) in taking the defence of the Nation, Religion, King and Parliament (to be reduced to Unity) to be my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Employment (while I owned not their Miſcarriages) yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the frailty of my underſtanding, I daily beg of God, that if I was miſtaken he will make me know it (for which I have long Prayed); and that he will pardon my Sins, which I would fain know, and fain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of, and publickly confeſs if I could know them; but dare not take the greateſt Duty of my life to be my Sin.</p>
               <p n="32">XXXII. I am in great doubt how far I did well or ill in my oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his Army at laſt. I am ſatisfied that it was my duty to diſown, and as I did, to oppoſe their Rebellion and other Sin: But there were many honeſt Pious men among them: And when God chooſeth the Executioners of his Juſtice as he pleaſeth, I am oft in doubt whether I ſhould not have been more Paſſive and Silent than I was; Though not as <hi>Jeremy</hi> to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> to perſwade men to ſubmit:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60957:19"/>
Yet to have forborn ſome ſharp publick Preaching and Writing againſt them, too late, when they ſet themſelves to promote Piety to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate their Uſurpation. To diſturb Poſſeſſors needeth a clear Call, when for what end ſoever they do that good, which men of better title will deſtroy.</p>
               <p n="33">XXXIII. When they commanded days of Prayer and Thankſgiving for their Wars in <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp;c. And when they impoſed the <hi>EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GAGEMENT to be true to the Commonwealth as it was eſtabliſhed without a King, and Houſe of Lords, I</hi> repent not that <hi>I</hi> refuſed it, and wrote and preach'd againſt it: But <hi>I</hi> doubt whether <hi>I</hi> did well in overdoing herein: And had not waited more ſilently on God's Providence, till he had cleared my way.</p>
               <p n="34">XXXIV. I repented oft that I wrote the Book called Aphoriſms of Juſtification and the Covenant: Not but that I think it ſound Doctrine and uſeful: But it being my firſt, is defective in Method and in ſome words which ſhould have been more clearly and cautelouſly expreſt: And in my perſonal oppoſition to Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s Errours, I ſhould have conſidered what a temptation it would prove to the Paſſions of ſuch a man (who yet grew more humble and orthodox before he died).</p>
               <p n="35">XXXV. Though my Conſcience telleth me that the very many Books which I after wrote, were for the propagating and defending of needful Truth, and that I never truſted to any thing but Truth and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for Victory, yet I fear leſt in many of them there be the faulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome imprudent provoking words, and that I did not always ſufficiently conſider what miſtaking men cannot bear, as well as what is congruous to the Matter and Cauſe. I ſtill found it difficult to avoid too much Keenneſs, and yet not to wrong the Cauſe by dull pretence of Lenity.</p>
               <p n="36">XXXVI. Two things concurred to cauſe me to write my Political Aphoriſms or Holy Common-wealth, of which I afterward repented.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>James Harrington</hi> wrote his <hi>Oceana</hi> for a <hi>looſe Popular Government,</hi> and Sir <hi>H. Vane</hi> was contriving another for a <hi>Military</hi> and <hi>Phanatick Democracy;</hi> both which I ſaw were utterly inconſiſtent with the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, Peace and Safety of the Land.</p>
               <p>2. Sir <hi>Francis Netherſole</hi> ſent purpoſely to me a Meſſenger to deſire me to go to <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and perſwade him to reſign the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to King <hi>Ch.</hi> II. I anſwered him that <hi>Cromwell</hi> had been tryed therein by many, but would not ſo eaſily reſign what he had got. He once admitted me to his Diſcourſe, and before the Lord <hi>Broghil, Lambert</hi> and <hi>Thurloe,</hi> I urged him to tell us, what the People of <hi>England</hi> had done to forfeit their right to the Enjoyment of their ancient conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Government, which they profeſſed to be for and ſtill deſired? And all the anſwer that I could have was, that God had changed it by his Providence, the paſſages of which he talkt over near two hours, till
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60957:20"/>
                  <hi>Lambert</hi> took on him to be aſleep: for we muſt not interrupt him. Then Sir <hi>Francis</hi> ſent me his Printed Books and ſome Papers, to have diſputed over all the Caſe of the War: And not knowing how many ſuch I might be put to anſwer, I thought beſt, in Print to tell him on what Grounds and Principles I had gone, not undertaking that I had not miſtaken, but to deſire him if I had erred to ſhew it by anſwering my Reaſons there given. But before I could have his Anſwer, the diſtracted Armies had overturned all the preſent Government.</p>
               <p>I repented Writing that Book, 1. Becauſe it came out unſeaſonably too late.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe in oppoſition to <hi>Harrington,</hi> I had pleaded for Monarchy, with ſome exceſs, and I wiſht that I had not medled with Government, but left all to the Providence of God.</p>
               <p>3. Becauſe it did occaſion more hurt than good: ſo that it became the common Theme of ambitious young Preachers, eſpecially at Court, before K. <hi>Ch.</hi> II. as the way to Preferment, to talk againſt <hi>The Holy Commonwealth,</hi> falſly perſwading men that by a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> I meant Democracy or Popular Government, which the Book was purpoſely written againſt. So that when the <hi>Oxford</hi> Univerſity burnt that Book (with Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi>'s excellent <hi>Reconciler,</hi> and ſome others) though I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulated with the Vice-Chancellor concerning its Principles, I told them I conſented that the Book was burnt: though I told them not why, as now I do.</p>
               <p n="37">XXXVII. Though both Nature and Grace inclined me to hate Lying, and ſpecially in Writers and Preachers, and I honoured <hi>Jul. Caeſ. Scaliger</hi> the more, becauſe his Son <hi>Joſeph</hi> tells us how vehemently he hated a Lie, ſo that he could not be reconciled to a Liar, yet I confeſs that my <hi>impatience herein</hi> was faulty. It was long before I well perceived that the Father of Lies, doth Govern his Kingdom (moſt of the World) by meer Lying: Call it <hi>Errour,</hi> or <hi>Miſtake,</hi> or <hi>Falſhood,</hi> or what you will, all ſignifieth the ſame thing: It is delivering <hi>Falſhood</hi> for <hi>Truth.</hi> Chriſt had told us that the Devil is the Father of Lies, and when he ſpeaketh a Lie, he ſpeaketh his own. Deceit is by Lying, and by this he ruleth his World. As God's Image conſiſteth in Life, Light and Love, the Devil's Image is Hatred. Falſhood and Hurtfulneſs or Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8 But alas to take this for ſome ſtrange thing, and to be <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impatient</hi> with Liars, was my fault, when now I find it is but the very ſtate of corrupt unreneved Nature: And <hi>Pride</hi> the Father, and <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> the Mother, make Kingdoms, Cities and Perſons like a rotting Carkaſs that ſwarms with Maggots. You that read Hiſtories, read with Judgment and due Suſpicion; for the common corrupt Nature is a lying Nature: And it is not about Religion only; but the Fool rageth and is confident in all his Errours. O what abundance of Lying Books
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60957:20"/>
are Shops and Libraries fill'd with, even in Hiſtory and Theology! What abundance of falſe Counſels do Phyſicians give! what abundance of falſe accuſations doth Envy and Malice vend? What abundance of falſe Doctrines and Cenſures doth ignorant Sectarian Zeal foment? How many Lies for one Truth is carried for News, or for Slander about the Streets? And how few ſcruple receiving and reporting them, &amp; how fewer rebuke them? It's uſeful for the World to know how common this Malady is, but it was almoſt in deſpair that I lately wrote a Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, of <hi>pretended Knowledge</hi> and Love) I blame not my ſelf for hating it, but being too <hi>impatient</hi> with it; eſpecially in <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> as if it had been a ſtrange thing.</p>
               <p n="38">XXXVIII. When I wrote my five Diſputations of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I too haſtily miſ tranſlated ſome words of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and though I then owned Apoſtolick Succeſſors in the continued part of their Work, I did not ſo fully as now underſtand, how Chriſt by Inſtitution then founded a National Church, nor what a National Church was; nor how that which was <hi>ultimum in executione</hi> (a Chriſtian Soveraignty) was <hi>primum in intentione,</hi> to which bare Preaching was preparatory.</p>
               <p n="39">XXXIX. When I wrote my Treatiſe of Epiſcopacy, I Calculated it to the Laudian Faction then prevalent, that called it ſelf, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and though I diſtinguiſhed them that put down all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Paſtors and Churches, and turned them all into meer Curates and Chappels (or <hi>partes Eccleſiarum infimarum</hi>) and ſo put down hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Biſhops and Churches under pretence of magnifying One; from the old Reformed Church of <hi>England</hi> that put not down theſe, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinfully fettered them, yet I did not ſo largely open the difference as I ought, which gave Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> occaſion to write confidently for Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p n="40">XL. When my Books againſt Conformity had irritated Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi> to make me an inſtance of miſchievous Separation (who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly heard and communicated with my Pariſh Churches, and for my private or occaſional Preaching had the Biſhops Licence approved under the hands of two the greateſt Lawyers of <hi>England</hi> (the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Sanders,</hi> and the now Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Polix<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>en</hi>) I doubt that I too provokingly took the advantage of his temerity, and confuted him in too provoking terms, not conſidering enough that a Man of great Learning, Labour, and Merit, and Name, hath a great intereſt of Reputation which he would not be inſenſible of: And if it were true as many without proof report, that his exaſperation engaged firſt Mr. <hi>Morrice,</hi> and after the ſecond Author of the Miſchief of Separation (whoſe writing againſt me is the tranſcript of the Character given by Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 8. 44.) yet I honour the Reading, Learning, Labour and great Worth of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> now Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and what ever hand he had in it, I unfeignedly forgive him.</p>
               <p n="41">
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:60957:21"/>XLI. And in defence of the Nonconformiſts againſt the falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Shiſm laid on them by the Impoſing Schiſmaticks, I doubt, I was too keen in confuting Mr. <hi>Sherlocke;</hi> I found it hard to diſcern whether the defence of truth and ſlandered ſuffering Servants of Chriſt, or not exaſperating falſe Accuſers ſhould command my ſtyle.</p>
               <p n="42">XLII. What other Errors there are or have been in my Life or Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, I daily beg of God to diſcover to me and pardon: For I never did any thing which might not and ought not to have been done better. Particularly I beg pardon for too frequent haſtineſs and harſhneſs of Speech, to my neareſt Domeſticks, from whom I never differed one moment in point of Intereſt or Love; but had too often ſour over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſty provoking words on trifling occaſions.</p>
               <p n="43">XLIII. But all forementioned ſet together lye not half ſo heavy on my Soul, as my inward <hi>Deficience</hi> and <hi>Omiſſion;</hi> That having had ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Convictions of the truth of Scripture, and the certainty of the Life to come, and can ſcarce think of any thing but death and the future ſtate, it is ſo ſure and near, and have read, and heard, and written ſo much of the Love of God and of Heaven as I have done, it ſhameth, it grieveth me, it maketh me even abhor and loath my ſelf, that I uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reach little higher than pacifick, quieting dull Affections, and that Faith, and Hope, and Love, do not keep me in more delightful thoughts of God and my Redeemer, and in a more joyful longing to be with Chriſt and all the Bleſſed; and that ever I ſhould have a cold and common thought of God and things ſo high and holy, and that the proſpect of my change, and the coming of Chriſt, is not a continual Feaſt to my Soul, and ſetteth me not more above the concerns of this vile and corruptible Fleſh, and above all impatience of pain, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the fears of Death and Corruption. O what a contradiction is there between that Head and Tongue that profeſſeth to believe what I profeſs, of God, of Chriſt, of Endleſs Glory, and that Heart that no more rejoiceth in that Belief and Hope, but by languor and decay of Nature, (and doubtleſs great imperfection of Faith) is kept from that joy that ſuch believing in reaſon ſhould produce, and goeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven with ſo many pawſes of fear or dulneſs, and ſo little of that Heavenly delight, which I have long been ſeeking of God, and which my low and weak condition needeth.</p>
               <p>Lord, all my ſins are known to thee, let me never be unwilling to know them, nor let them be ſo unknown to me as to invalidate my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or fruſtrate my hope of pardon through Chriſt.</p>

            <p>§ 1. AS it is no leſs ſin to Murder ones ſelf, than to Murder ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo it is no leſs to belie ones ſelf than to belie another. Yea it is the greater in that it is like to be more againſt knowledge, we being better acquainted with our own thoughts and deeds than with other Mens: And it would be the greater ſin in me, becauſe that the Father of Lies purpoſely deſigneth his calumnies, to cauſe hatred in many, and to fruſtrate all my Writings both to the Church and to particular Souls.</p>
            <p>§ 2. Why I cannot Repent of my Writings againſt the Sadduers or Brutiſts, the Antitrinitarians, the Somatiſts, the Quakers, the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, the Antinominians, the Papiſts, the Separating Dividers, and the reſt before-mentioned, the Books that I have written againſt them expreſs my Reaſons. But no Men call me to it by ſuch an agreeing number of voices as the late Proteſtant Conformiſts of that fiercer ſort who appropriate to themſelves the Name of the Epiſcopal Church of <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially thoſe that are for a Forreign or Univerſal Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Juriſdiction. And no Man hath done it with ſuch virulent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice as the <hi>Anonymus</hi> Author of the Book called, <hi>The Second part of the Unreaſonableneſs of Separation</hi> as ſeconding Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet.</hi> Whoſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel I ſhall now peruſe, and return the Reaſons why I cannot Repent of all that he reciteth by way of Accuſation.</p>
            <p>§ 3. I. In his Preface, <hi>That my Opinions and Practices have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the generality of Chriſtians from the moſt Primitive and Pureſt Times of the Church. Anſ.</hi> To which I appeal, and can get no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <p>§ 4. II. I muſt firſt tell the Reader that ſhould I ſtay to confute all the falſification of my words which he pretendeth to recite, it would make an unſavoury, tedious, unprofitable Volume. A word put in, or left out, or altered, will ſerve our grand Accuſer to do much of his Works with the Sons of Ignorance and Malice.</p>
            <p>He ſeemeth to expect that I ſhould Repent of ſaying that our Civil War between King and Parliament was begun in <hi>England</hi> between two Parties of Epiſcopal Proteſtants: And muſt I repent that I lived in <hi>England?</hi> And that I know what it was naturally impoſſible for me not to know? Why doth he not alſo make me a Liar for ſaying that I then dwelt in <hi>England;</hi> and both ſides were Engliſh Men, and ſpake Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh?

               </gap> had Malice enough to make me mad, I might have needed none of his impoſed Repentance. I have in another writing named the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of the Army, and the Parliaments Lords Lieutenants, and all the Major Generals, beſides the Chaplains, and Challenged them to find among all theſe one Presbyterian or two Independants for ten, if not twenty Epiſcopal Proteſtants. A Wiſe and Credible Parliament Man yet living, hath oft told me that when the War begun he knew but One Presbyterian in all the Houſe of Commons, (which was worthy Mr. <hi>Tate</hi> of <hi>Northampton</hi>) it being not then known among them. The Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> who commanded at Sea I knew to be for Communion with the Patiſh and Epiſcopal Churches. In the Army let them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the Communion and Religion of the General and all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and I believe they will find among all the Colonels but two Independants (the Lord <hi>Say</hi> and the Lord <hi>Brooke</hi>) and one moderate Puritane yet living (the Lord <hi>Wharton</hi>) and that all the reſt were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Epiſcopal Conformiſts (what the old Scots Souldiers <hi>Browne</hi> and <hi>Urrey</hi> that turn'd to the King were I know not, ſuppoſing their pay was their Religion.) We knew this to be true of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> General; the Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> General of the Horſe is yet living and well known: Sir <hi>John Merrike</hi> Major General, Colonel <hi>Dolbiere,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> General of the Ordnance, <hi>Lionell Copley</hi> Scout-Maſter, the Earl of <hi>Stampford,</hi> the Lord <hi>Roberts</hi> lately Preſident of the Kings Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; the Lord <hi>Hollis,</hi> the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> (after Earl of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> and Lord Chamberlain that choſe the Kings Preachers, and conſtantly heard them, the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> (Earl of <hi>Huntington</hi>) the Lord <hi>Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> (after Earl of <hi>Dover</hi>) the Lord <hi>Fielding</hi> (after Earl of <hi>Denbigh</hi>) the Lord St. <hi>John</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Bullingbrook</hi> kill'd at <hi>Edghill</hi>) Col. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> Col. <hi>Lſſex,</hi> Col. <hi>Grantham,</hi> Col.

I have named the reſt elſewhere. I heard enough of Col. <hi>Sandyes</hi> before he was mortally wounded to tell me that he was no Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane.</p>
            <p>And as for the Major Generals of the ſeveral Counties, the Lord <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando Fairfax,</hi> the Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> of <hi>Parham,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Stampford,</hi> Sir <hi>John Gell,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho.

The Archbiſhop of <hi>York Williams</hi> was one of them, and was not he for Epiſcopacy?</p>
            <p>§ 5. <q>But the Accuſer confuteth all this by telling us, that it began in King <hi>James</hi> days between the <hi>Regians</hi> and the <hi>Republicans,</hi> between
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60957:22"/>
Prerogative and Priviledge, by a Party that would have perſwaded the King, to War for the Palatinate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And why began he it not in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, who more overtopt Parliaments than King <hi>James</hi> did? I perceive by this Man, that none muſt paſs for Conformable and Epiſcopal, that are not of <hi>Sibthorp</hi> and <hi>Mainwaring</hi>'s Mind, and renounce not Parliamentary Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and give not up Property and Liberty to the meer will of the King called Prerogative. And ſo all our Parliaments till the Dividing and Tearing Long one, were not of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And what then was that Church? Was it a <hi>Chriſtian Kingdom,</hi> and yet was the Kingdom Repreſentative no part of it? Are none but Leeches, <hi>Sangutſugi's,</hi> Men of Blood, (that muſt have all lye and die in Goals among Rogues, that will not Swear, and Subſcribe, and Declare and Covenant, and Practiſe, all that they impoſe) of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> What a Reproach is this to ſuch a Church?</p>
            <p>If I muſt Repent that I take not all the old Parliaments, and all the Biſhops in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days to be no Church Proteſtants; if I muſt Repent for taking <hi>Jewel,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Bilſon, Ri.

S.</hi> Parliament Speeches, if I muſt take this King and Parliament, and all the Biſhops and Clergy that Conform to them, to be no Proteſtants of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe they have made a Law declaring it to be the Rights and Liberties of the people, to be governed by Law, and not by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Prerogative, and have aſſerted what the old Parliaments claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I muſt then heinouſly diſhonour the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that I am a Man.</p>
            <p>§ 6. He falſly feigneth me to ſay that the Biſhops began the War, becauſe I ſaid it began between the two Epiſcopal Parties, thoſe that were of Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot</hi>'s and the old Reformers way, and thoſe that were for <hi>Land</hi>'s Innovations and Perſecutions: And I ſhould juſtly be noted for vain and tedious if I would ſtand to anſwer all his talk about the Provocations: He that will read <hi>Whitlock</hi> may have full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and particularly find that the Parliament voted a Dioceſane in every County, when they began to reform: And were they not then for Epiſcopacy?</p>

Is not the common Cry of City and Countrey a ſufficient witneſs that the Sectaries take me not for their Champion, but their Adverſary. Indeed they have ſhewed it but by words; it being but the two Maſter Sects, Papiſts and Tory Prelatiſts, that ſhew it by Fining, Silencing, Priſon, and taking all for their prey.</p>
            <p>§ 9. The Accuſer tells me, that it is no new thing for Hereticks to have many admirers, and to pretend to purity that they may deceive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Which is very true, and I will add, that which is far worſe: It is no new thing even for them that do not ſo much as ſeem to have either Purity, Conſcience or common Honeſty, no nor to ſcruple the groſſeſt Lying and Perjury, to have more Followers than Chriſt himſelf had while he was on Earth, notwithſtanding his Purity and all his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: Such Men find corrupted nature, as diſpoſed to believe and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, as a Dunghil to breed Weeds, or a Carcaſe Maggots: Even thoſe that openly militate under Satan as deadly Enemies to ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Godlineſs, if they will but cloak their malignity with the Name of a Sacred Function, and call Piety and Conſcience by their own Titles (Hypocriſie and Schiſm) ſhall convert more Souls to Diaboliſm in a little time, than all the Preachers that they ſilence could have conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Piety, and ſerious Chriſtianity: And the French Prelacy and Dragoon Diſcipline, will cleanſe a Nation quickly, from Proteſtant Hereſie and Schiſm. We hope not for the honour of having more Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers than ſuch Men.</p>

If it be the Power of Silencing the moſt Godly, and Practical, and Blameleſs Preachers, and of Beggering, and Murdering by long Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment in common Goals both Preachers and Hearers that will not give over all publick Worſhip of God like Atheiſts, till they dare ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Lie and be Perjured, and own all that ſuch Men bid them ſay

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> How came I to eſcape till now my ſelf? Not at all by your Clemency: Your Patron Judge <hi>Jeffreys</hi> on the Bench ſaid, <hi>He was ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that the Act of Indempnity diſabled him from Hanging me:</hi> And your Mouth <hi>Roger Le Strange</hi> foretold the Reaſon: <hi>Never was ſo wicked a Book written as my Paraphraſe on the New Teſtament.</hi> Were I at his Ear I would whiſper to him, <hi>Do you not take the New Teſtament it ſelf to be far worſe?</hi> But what is the deadly evil? Why I ſay with <hi>Paul, That if an Angel from Heaven preach another Goſpel let him be accurſed?</hi> But did I make thoſe words? Or find them made: The Judge by the help of our Great Clergy-men and their Curates, found out eight Paraphraſes that deſerved this Death. The ſum of which was that I accuſe the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, and Herodians, and Prieſts, for malicious hating and murdering Chriſt, for doing good and working Miracles; and for urging Men to be Informers againſt him, and for forbidding the Apoſtles to Preach: And they ſaid that by an <hi>Innuendo</hi> I meant all this of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And when a Famous (but exaſperated Dr.) gathered ſome paſſages as Seditious againſt Government to have hanged me, even our Judges and proſecutors ſearching the Books, and particularly on <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. caſt by thoſe accuſations, and never mentioned them. And when they burnt my Political Aphoriſms, and I wrote my Judgment thereof to the Vice-Chancellor, I had not a word of contradiction.</p>
            <p>But there are deeper Reaſons that cauſe both Papiſts and Cainites to wiſh that all that I have written were burnt to Aſhes. And they tell me what to expect from them, if God reſtrain them not, for then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it is more than my writings, and than the Nonconformiſts that they will burn. They that cannot now endure that any but they ſhould be heard, will not endure that they be read.</p>

better, I am a Liar. And is this the Expoſition of the Declaration for want of which we are (if we preach) uſed like Rogues in Goals, <hi>viz. That we aſſent and conſent to all things contained in and preſcribed by, the Book of Common Prayer, Ordination and Articles, and that there is nothing in it contrary to the Word of God?</hi> Is it Integrally perfect: Or muſt I wiſh it burnt elſe? I am not for ſo hard uſage of it, though I cannot juſtifie the preſcribing two <hi>Eaſter</hi> days in it, and far worſe matters. But what is the fault that deſerveth burning?</p>
            <p>§ 13. <hi>Ibid.</hi> [<hi>His own Practice demonſtrates that his Writings for Peace and Unity are but ſo many Pleas for Schiſm and Diviſion. They need an</hi> Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Expurgatorius.</p>

            <p>But Reader, ſeeing all my Books muſt be burnt as a Sacrifice to the Accuſers of my Converſation as for Schiſm and Diviſion, I owe the World a particular account of ſuch an accuſed practice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When I firſt forbore practical Conformity it was but in a ſcrupled part: I read moſt of the Common Prayer, and I received the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Kneeling.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I never diſobeyed my Ordinary's command, but got me to a place where the Ordinary thought as I did.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ever diſſwaded people from Separation, and reprehended thoſe Nonconformiſts that inclined towards it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It was I confeſs a Dividing practice that I took the Scots Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant before I foreſaw it would be uſed to Diviſion. But I quickly repented, and kept my Flock and Thouſands from taking it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I had not the laſt or leaſt hand in ſuppreſſing the promoters of Schiſm where I lived.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I purpoſely hazarded my Life, and ſpent Time and Labour a year and half in <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s Army, in hope (too late) to have healed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the foreſeen Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Diviſions.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I got the Miniſters of <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> and the Neighbour Counties, <hi>Epiſcopal, Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>moderate Independants</hi> to ſubſcribe an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in practice ſo far as they agreed in Principles: Which Dr. <hi>Warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtree</hi> and Dr. <hi>Good</hi> conſented to till Dr. <hi>Guning</hi> drew them off again. And <hi>Weſtmoreland, Cumberland, Dorſetſhire, Wiltſhire, Hampſhire, Eſſex,</hi> and <hi>Dublin</hi> all imitated us, ſo that we were ready to have had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Concord.</p>
            <p n="8">8. By Letters I treated for Union with Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig,</hi> Archbiſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> and ſuch others, before King <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond's Return.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I preach'd for peace to the Parliament and City in publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:60957:24"/>10. I got divers Meetings before the King came in, with many peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Drs. (Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> Dr. <hi>Allen,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gulſton, &amp;c.</hi>) with whom Dr. <hi>Morley</hi> would be one that he might fruſtrate all) who ſeemed to be all for Unity.</p>
            <p n="11">11. I was the firſt (with Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Aſh</hi>) that ſought to the King to help us to this deſired Unity by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; who ſeemed forward to it, and promiſed that he would draw them to meet us half way.</p>
            <p n="12">12. We never offered any form of Church Government, but Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi>'s Primitive Epiſcopacy, and gave publick thanks for a ſeeming Grant of much leſs; never once ſpeaking againſt the Biſhops Parliament Powers, Baronies, Revenues or Pomp.</p>
            <p n="13">13. When Chancellor <hi>Hide</hi> as from the King offered me a Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick I refuſed it on terms (in a Letter) that pleaſed him, <hi>viz.</hi> That if the King continued what he had granted in his Declaration, I ſhould take it for my great Duty to do all that I could by writing and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to perſwade all to Conformity and Unity; and therefore would not be a Biſhop, leſt I ſhould fruſtrate that labour by making Men think that I did it for my ſelf. But if no ſuch liberty was intended to be continued (which I eaſily foreſaw) why ſhould I be a Biſhop to be quickly caſt out?</p>
            <p n="14">14. Had my Life lain on it I could have done no more to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented our Diviſions and foreſeen Confuſions, that I did in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at <hi>Worceſter</hi>-Houſe, and at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> by reaſon, and by earneſt and humble petition and true prediction. But all did but enrage, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Abatements according to the Kings Commiſſion, far more was after impoſed than before.</p>
            <p n="15">15. I went voluntarily to Biſhop <hi>Sheldon</hi> for his Licenſe, when I could have had it by the Kings Declaration without any Subſcription, and I Subſcribed what might ſhew that I was for peace, that I would not preach againſt the Liturgy or Ceremonies, but live peaceably.</p>
            <p n="16">16. When Biſhop <hi>Morley</hi> forbad me preaching in his Dioceſs, I ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him leave but to preach to ſome ſmall Village among the ignorant where there was no Maintenance for a Miniſter: And he old me, They were better have none than me. Mr. <hi>Baldwin</hi> yet living was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p n="17">17. When Lying ſame accuſed me for almoſt every Sermon that I preached in <hi>London</hi> after, Biſhop <hi>Sheldon</hi> told me plainly that he had ſome to hear me, and could they have got any thing againſt me I had ſoon heard from him.</p>
            <p n="18">18. When we were all ſilenced on <hi>Aug.</hi> 24. 1662. I forbore both preaching and privater Meetings, till after the great Plague 1665. to ſee whether our obedience would mollifie Mens exaſperated Minds: All that while and after conſtantly I went to my Pariſh Church Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60957:25"/>
and Evening, and ſtaid from the beginning of Common Prayer to the end, and after the Plague I only taught ſuch Neighbours as came into my Houſe between the publick Exerciſes, and led all the people into the Church to Common Prayer. In ſo much that my Excellent Neighbour Judge <hi>Hale</hi> countenanced me therein by his Carriage, and thought I did great Service to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I remember not two of all that heard me that went not with me to the publick Church: And that One that would not, refuſed, becauſe the Dr. (<hi>Rieves</hi>) would Swear in his common talk: But I told her that he did not Swear in the Pulpit.</p>
            <p n="19">19. When in his Sermon he told them that <hi>It was becauſe we could not be Biſhops that we Conformed not,</hi> the people look'd at me, as a confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But I forbore not ever the more to hear him.</p>
            <p n="20">20. When he was no longer able to bear the peoples coming to my Houſe, (though he converſt with me placidly, and never ſpake to me againſt it) he went to the King and got his Order to the Biſhop <hi>Hinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and by him to Juſtice <hi>Roſſe</hi> and Auditor <hi>Philips</hi> for my Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And when theſe Juſtices at <hi>Brainford</hi> Examined me, they ſhut the Doors againſt all Witneſſes, and would let none in but their Clerk, though Alderman <hi>Aſhhurſt,</hi> Captain <hi>Yarrington,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at the Door claimed open audience as a Legal Priviledge: And after they raiſed falſe reports of my words to them, when I was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no one Witneſs.</p>
            <p n="21">21. I lay quietly in <hi>New Priſon,</hi> though kept waking by the conſtant noiſe of rude Priſoners, and knocking under me at the Gate. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> all the four Judges of the Common <hi>Pleas</hi> were for my Deliverance.</p>
            <p n="22">22. When I was delivered the Parliament making a new Act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Conventicles added three new clauſes which drove me to dwell in another County: Where alſo I went conſtantly Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the publick Church and Common Prayer, and gave 2 <hi>l. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> to increaſe the Miniſters Maintenance.</p>
            <p n="23">23. When Miniſters had ſome time forborn publick Sacraments in the Pariſh Churches, I got many of the moſt Eminent in <hi>London</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in writing gave them ſo many reaſons for ſuch Communion as they approved. But the <hi>Oxford</hi> Parliament having by an Act Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us five Miles from all Corporations, forc'd them from the <hi>London</hi> Churches when in Conſcience they durſt not leave <hi>London</hi> Service; when 100000 had died of the Plague, and the Miniſters fled and left the dying without their help, many Nonconformiſts ventured their lives among them, beg'd Money for them, and relieved them, and found the dying Perſons ſo much inclined to hear, repent and pray, that this brake the Bonds of the Acts of Uniformity and Baniſhment, ſo that they reſolved rather to die than to ceaſe preaching while they were out
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60957:25"/>
of Priſon and could ſpeak. And the City being burnt the next year, confirmed their reſolution, the Conformiſts ceaſing to preach long for want of Churches. But all this time, had a Nonconformiſt Miniſter been ſeen in a Pariſh Church, he muſt for Six Months have lain in Goal with Rogues: So that the ſum of their impoſed Obedience was, [Either inhumanely deſert the deſerted City after Plagues and Flames left deſolate; or go to the Pariſh Miniſters when they return and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with them, and go Six Months to Goal; or elſe be Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate and lye in Goal for not Communicating with them.] Of theſe three they had their choice.</p>
            <p>But in all this time I was driven far off and kept conſtantly to the publick Church (at <hi>Toteridge.</hi>)</p>
            <p n="24">24. I never became the Paſtor of any Church ſince I was expelled from <hi>Kiderminſter:</hi> I offered when I refuſed a Biſhoprick to preach there for nothing under the ignorant Reader that was Vicar: But the Lord Chancellor <hi>Hyde</hi> wrote to Sir <hi>Ralph Clare</hi> that his Majeſty thought himſelf not well dealt with that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> that had deſerved ſo well of him had not the Vicaridge, and he promiſed to pay the Vicar the worth of it by his own Steward Mr. <hi>Clutterbuke,</hi> out of his own Rents: But durſt not give a Prebend much leſs a Paſtoral Charge to the Vicar, leſt it diſgrace the Miniſtry: I was not ſo ignorant as not to know what the King and Chancellor meant by all this (and by the Gracious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.) But he gave me unſealed the Copy of his Letter to ſend: And the Vicar anſwered as he was taught that he would not quit his place for an uncertainty (nor would Biſhop <hi>Morley</hi> let me preach for nothing under him.)</p>
            <p n="25">25. When the King ſent out his Declaration that gave us leave to preach, I returned to <hi>London,</hi> and choſe only St. <hi>Martins</hi> Pariſh to preach in, becauſe there were ſaid to be above Sixty Thouſand Souls more than could hear in the Church; and hiring a room over the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-houſe at St. <hi>James</hi>'s (where we were all delivered by almoſt a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle from a crack in the Floor) I publiſhed to the Hearers (and left to them in writing) that I came not thither to gather or preach to any new Church, or as ſeparating from the Pariſh Church, but (being Vowed to the Miniſtry) in neceſſary compaſſion <hi>pro tempore</hi> to help part of the many thouſands that could not come into the Pariſh Church: For which ſome Separatiſts cenſured me: And we uſed the Scripture, part of the Liturgy and more.</p>
            <p n="26">26. Being driven from that Room by the breach of the Main-beam, I built a Room and Leaſed the Ground at too dear rates in <hi>Oxenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet</hi> near. But had preached but one Sermon, but Secretary <hi>Henry Coventree</hi> with two Juſtices more came with a Warrant to apprehend me, and I being twenty Miles diſtant, they ſeized on Mr. <hi>Sedden</hi> a ſtranger that preached for me: And though he had by the Cromwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60957:26"/>
ſuffered Impriſonment for ſeeking to bring in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, they ſent him to the Goal, where it coſt me twenty pound for his Charges, but my Wiſeſt and moſt Over-valuing Friend Judge <hi>Hale</hi> proved the Mittimus void, and releaſed him by the Sentence of all the Court.</p>
            <p n="27">27. When I could not be ſuffered there I hired a Room to preach in for nothing in <hi>Swallow-ſtreet,</hi> and ask'd the Biſhops leave, who gave ſome hope of his favour: But after a few days many Conſtables, Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens, and other Officers were ſet at the Door to take me had I come, and ſo continued about three Months, till another came.</p>
            <p n="28">28. I then (that the people might not be untaught) offered Dr. <hi>William Loyd</hi> now Biſhop of St. <hi>Aſaph</hi> my Chappel for the Pariſh uſe; And, I thank him he accepted it, and it is ſo uſed by Dr. <hi>Tenniſon</hi> to this day.</p>
            <p n="29">29. In the Country I Preach'd in <hi>Rickaurſworth, Chaferne, Amerſham, Cheſham, Langley, Surra<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> in the Pariſh Churches to ſhew that I was not for Separation, and went to the beginning of Common-Prayer.</p>
            <p n="30">30. I was in Law-ſence no Nonconformiſt I think) but only in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: For I had the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s Licenſe and I was in no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice or Lecture after <hi>May</hi> 1. 1662. And hereupon Sir <hi>Edmond San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice, and Sir <hi>Henry Polixfen,</hi> now Lord Chief Juſtice, gave it me under their hands that my Licenſe was ſtill valid, and gave me Authority to Preach occaſional Sermons in <hi>London</hi> Dioceſs. Yet did I never uſe that Power in any Pariſh here, to avoid offence.</p>
            <p n="31">31. I ſent my Licenſe with theſe Lawyers Judgment, to the preſent Biſhop Dr. <hi>Compton,</hi> craving his conſent to uſe it in the Country. Of which he being unwilling, I forbore, though the Law allowed it.</p>
            <p n="32">32. An Iriſh Informer (<hi>Keting</hi> a Gold-worker) thought to ſet up that Trade for Gain: But was croſs'd, and long waited at my Door to ask me forgiveneſs; And I being loth to truſt him, he wrote to me his Repentance, and ſhortly after being Impriſoned for Debt (ſaying that God never after proſpered him) I got him ſome Money and help'd him out.</p>
            <p n="33">33. Three or Four more Informers ſetting up the Trade accuſed me to Sir <hi>Tho Davis</hi> Lord Mayor: I could not make him believe that he was Judge of my faults, but that the Informers were the Judges, and that he muſt execute what they ſware againſt me: Nor could I prevail with him to let me ſee any one of them, nor hear their Accuſations, nor examine or conſute them: And when I was fined unheard, ſhortly after the chief of the Informers met me in the Street, confeſt his Fault, askt me Forgiveneſs, and left his Trade.</p>
            <p n="34">34. Dr. <hi>Manton</hi> and I were invited by the Lord Keeper <hi>Bridgman</hi> (with Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> after) to accept the Kings offer for a Comprehenſion for us, and a Toleration for others: Dr. <hi>Wilkins</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hez. Burton</hi> were appointed to treat with us of the terms: we came to an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60957:26"/>
to a word: we gave it Judge <hi>Hale</hi> to draw up in form of an Act to be offered to the Parliament. And was that like to be ſo wicked an Agreement as to be worſe than all our Diviſions, which ſuch Wiſe and Excellent Men as Judge <hi>Hale</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Wilkins,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Burton</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved: But we refuſed to meddle with the Toleration, leaving his own work to the King and the concerned: And ſo the Parliament was taught to reject all.</p>
            <p n="35">35. After this at another Seſſion, many being ſet on our Concord, Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> were moved by <hi>Morley</hi> and ſome Lords to treat with us for Union: I got many excellent peaceable Miniſters together, and we drew in one Sheet a form of Concord: The two Drs. ſeemed to conſent, ſo be it the Biſhops liked it: But <hi>Morley</hi> purpoſely ſeemed to be for the End, that he might fruſtrate the means, and ſo we never heard more of it.</p>
            <p n="36">36. All this while to this day, I never gathered a Church, nor was Paſtor or Teacher of a Church, nor took any Salary, but preach'd without pay as an occaſional helper to another, leſt I ſhould ſeem to be for Separation: I thank God that left me not to Neceſſities.</p>
            <p n="37">37. I perſwaded the people to hear the Pariſh Miniſters and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with them, and not to come to us without the want of need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful helps at home; and I gave the Sacrament to none of them, till late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a few in my own Houſe for a ſhort time, which the Liturgy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p n="38">38. I was ſuddenly aſſaulted by violence on my Doors, by two or three Informers (<hi>Hilton</hi> and <hi>Bucke</hi>) and <hi>Rutland</hi> a Vintner Conſtable, and other Officers, by a Warrant from Sir <hi>James Butler</hi> ſent him by Sir <hi>James Smith,</hi> to be Executed, who had judged me to be diſtrained on for 90 <hi>l.</hi> (or more) for five Sermons as preached by me againſt Law; and I never to this day was ſummon'd to anſwer, nor heard who were my Accuſers or Witneſſes, or what proof. But they ſeized on all my Goods, Bed, Cloaths, Library, and praiſed it, and ſold it, (I got a Friend to buy it and paid him.) When had I been heard I had ſhewed them Sir <hi>Edm. Sa<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>rs</hi> Hand that they ought not to Impriſon me unſummoned and unheard; and I had ſhewed them my valid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and proved that I did nothing contrary to Law. And that I was twenty Miles off at the pretended time of one of the Sermons. But I never ſought remedy nor noiſed any Accuſation againſt theſe Juſtices.</p>
            <p n="39">39. At the ſame time they brought a Warrant from Juſtice <hi>Parry</hi> and Lame <hi>Philips</hi> to have ſent me Six Months to Goal for dwelling in <hi>London:</hi> But as I was going towards them, ſome ſtopt me till the King ſuſpended it, and ſaid, <hi>Let him die in his Bed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="40">40. Upon this to avoid this Impriſonment I was forced to abſcond in poor ſtrange Houſes (in languor and conſtant pain) while I paid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo great Rent for my own empty Houſe: Which I bore without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining noiſe.</p>
            <p n="41">
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:60957:27"/>41. The Independants and Separatiſts ſaid that I was juſtly uſed, and had drawn more to the publick Churches than all the Miniſters in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi> And ſome of them ſaid I had done more harm by it than ever I did good.</p>
            <p n="42">42. I wrote many Books againſt Schiſm and Separation (againſt <hi>Bagſhaw, Danvers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> and many others) to prove the Lay Communion Lawful.</p>
            <p n="43">43. <hi>Roger Le Strange</hi> traduced me in his Obſervations moſt bitterly and cauſleſly (to foretel me what was purpoſed againſt me:) Even my Book of Patience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and my Paraphraſe he virulently reviled.</p>
            <p n="44">44. When I was deſigned for the Goal (before King <hi>Charles</hi> died) the Duke of <hi>York</hi> foretold it: And to ſecure me till they could find matter of Accuſation, they bound me to the good behaviour under deep Bonds of me and my Sureties. Openly declaring, That they took me for innocent, and had nothing againſt me, and did it not as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, but for prevention; intimating that the Court required it (or <hi>Jefferies.</hi>)</p>
            <p n="45">45. When they were prepared <hi>Jefferies</hi> accuſed my Paraphraſe as aforeſaid; and ſent me to Priſon. Coming out by a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> I was fain to abſcond in the Countrey (in conſtant pain) till the Term. Then my oft waitings at the Bar (when I could not ſtand) and there to be ragingly reviled by <hi>Jefferies</hi> and <hi>Withins,</hi> and called Rogue and Knave, and not ſuffered to ſpeak one word of anſwer for my ſelf, and my Council reviled that offered to ſpeak for me, was far harder than my Impriſonment. And when (going from the Bar) I only ſaid, <hi>That his Predeceſſor thought otherwiſe of me.</hi>] He ſaid, <hi>There was not an honeſt Man in</hi> England <hi>that took me not for a Knave;</hi>] not excepting the King that had given me another teſtimony (in words.)</p>
            <p n="46">46. Thence I went quietly to a coſtly Priſon, where I continued in pain and languor near two years: Enjoying more quietneſs in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement than I had done of many years before: Becauſe they had no further to hunt me. And God there healed my Bloody Urine that had continued two years.</p>
            <p n="47">47. Being Fined 500 Marks, and to give Bond for the Behaviour, when they ſaw that I did neither pay the Fine nor Petition, the King and Papiſts, who all this while did their work by Men called Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, reſolved to have the thanks for my Releaſe; and offered me deliverance by the Marqueſs of <hi>Powis</hi> his endeavour: But they would not abate my Bonds to the Behaviour.</p>
            <p n="48">48. When I was releaſed the Proteſtant Juſtices at the Seſſions that declared they had nothing againſt me, would not take up my former Bonds, but made me long wait with Counſel at <hi>Hicks Hall,</hi> and I know not that they have given up my Bonds to this day: But Patience is my remedy.</p>
            <p n="49">
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:60957:27"/>49. Before while I lived in St. <hi>Giles's</hi> Pariſh I went Morning and Evening to the Pariſh Church to Common Prayer and Sermon: And I Communicated kneeling at the Rails. But I firſt told Dr <hi>Sharp</hi> now Dean of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that I am <hi>ipſo facto</hi> Excommunicate by Canon 7, 8, 9. and left it to his conſideration: But after Conſultation he admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me, becauſe the Canon bound him not before proſecution or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</p>
            <p n="50">50. <hi>In Priſon and ſince my Releaſe I have written divers Books for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the publick Churches: And one of Government, and one againſt Schiſm, and others pacificatory that are not printed. And I have continued to preach only as a helper to another, not related to any gathered Church as their Teacher, though Licenſed by Law to have gathered ſuch a Church as well as others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="51">51. The reaſon why I have not theſe four years gone to any Pariſh Church, is becauſe Priſons and utter diſability of Body hindered me, being ſcarce able to creep once a day to our Aſſembly but the fourth Door from my Houſe.</p>
            <p n="52">52. To conclude, Whoever after reading my many great and ſmall Writings for Concord and Peace, and for the Church, eſpecially my Cure of Church Diviſions, my Treatiſe of the way of Unity, my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Theology, my Chriſtian Directory, my <hi>Methodus Theologiae,</hi> and the numerous Volumes of Controverſie, written all to end Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, and ſhall know that it hath been my chief ſtudy and labour theſe forty four years to promote Unity, Peace, and Concord, and what I have ſuffered for it, and yet will accuſe my Heart and Life, as quite contrary to all this, muſt bring to any ſober impartial Man, very clear evidence to prove me ſo mad and deadly an Enemy to ſo long and painful Labours.</p>
            <p>§ 14. I am next therefore further to enquire what this Evidence is.</p>
            <p>But his words do ſeem to forbid an anſwer, for they are capable of none but what will ſound harſhly, even to name them as they are <hi>Moſt Impudent Lies, meer forgeries,</hi> or the moſt unqueſtionable Duties made moſt odious ſins; and moſt of the pretence fetcht from ſome words of my Writings and Confeſſions depraved and impudently falſified.</p>
            <p>The General Accuſation is page 14. [<hi>I dare challenge any Hiſtorian that hath obſerved or read the Tragedies of the late times, to ſhew a parallel in any one perſon (I ſay not only among the</hi> Apoſtate <hi>Clergy, but the Laity, and the worſt of them) that may equal Mr.</hi> B.</p>
            <p>Accuſ. I. Particularly: <hi>Who is there among the Living that entertained more early Prejudices againſt the Biſhops?</hi>] <hi>Anſ.</hi> Mendac. I. I thought them to be of Divine Inſtitution, till after I was Ordained. And ſince then I have proved it of the Primitive Epiſcopacy: And oppoſed none but that ſort of Dioceſans who put down all the Biſhops and Churches
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60957:28"/>
that ſhould be under them, and will be the ſole Biſhops of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or ſcore Pariſhes, making true Epiſcopal Diſcipline impoſſible, and ſubſtituting a deluſion.</p>
            <p>§ 15. Accuſ. II. [<hi>That left his Calling as a Minister of Peace, and entred with the firſt into a War againſt the King.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Mendac. II. I never left my Calling, nor ever took Command or Office, or ſo much as a Chaplains relation to any Souldiers, nor pay for it: Save that when <hi>Naſeby</hi> Fight almoſt ended the War, I went a Chaplain to have tryed to ſave the Land from Rebellion.</p>
            <p>I always was for King and Parliament, and never againſt the Kings Perſon, Power or Prerogative, but only for his return to his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and againſt his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Inſtruments:</hi> When <hi>Hen.</hi> VI. was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about by his Enemies, his Friends fought for him that fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Army where his Perſon was.</p>
            <p>I was ſo far from going into a War with the firſt, that I only fled to <hi>Coventry</hi> for a private Refuge, when I was forced from Home (of which enough before.)</p>
            <p>§ 16. Accuſ. III. [<hi>And for four years ſpace, which was the heat of the Wars, was an Agent as well as an Eye-witneſs of moſt of the terrible Battles that were fought in</hi> England.]</p>
            <p>Mendac. IV. I never ſo much as ſaw one of thoſe terrible Battles. The firſt that ever I ſaw was that at <hi>Langport,</hi> when the Field War ended: And there I ſaw not the killing of one Man. Becauſe I ſaid that I ſaw ſome Fields and Dead, he forgeth me to have ſeen the Fights. I never ſaw the Fight at <hi>Edgehill,</hi> but being at <hi>Alcester,</hi> I went to ſee the Ground and ſome unburied Bodies the following day. I never ſaw either of the two <hi>Newberry</hi> Fights, nor the Countrey; I never ſaw the Fight at <hi>Horncastle,</hi> at <hi>Allford,</hi> or any in the Eaſt, South, Weſt, or North. I never ſaw the greateſt Fight at <hi>York,</hi> nor ever was in or near the County: I ſaw not that at <hi>Mongomery,</hi> nor that at <hi>Nampwich,</hi> nor any Fight in <hi>England,</hi> ſave that aforeſaid at <hi>Langport,</hi> and the flight of our <hi>Coventry</hi> Men from <hi>Banbury:</hi> And I went to ſee the Ground at <hi>Naſeby</hi> when the Armies were gone a day or two before: And I once ſaw at a diſtance about thirty Men of a ſide Fight between <hi>Linſell</hi> and <hi>Longford,</hi> where one was kill'd. Some Sieges I was not far off, while I was with the Armies on the Accounts at large before recited.</p>
            <p>§ 17. Accuſ. IV. <hi>Who ever boasted of drawing thouſands to that War?</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> He falſly calleth a <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> a <hi>Boasting.</hi> To convince <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well's</hi> Soulders that pull'd <hi>down</hi> the <hi>Government,</hi> I that had drawn thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands into the Parliaments defenſive War, could not have denied the heinouſneſs of my Crime, if I had done as they did, or been againſt King and Parliament united, or for the changing of the Government. I ſaid by aggravation that I had drawn in thouſands, becauſe at <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> and <hi>Wem</hi> I had publickly preach'd againſt the accuſations of the Cauſe that I then thought juſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:60957:28"/>§ 18. Accuſ. V. <hi>Who hath ſaid more to justifie, not the War only, but the Death of the Royal Martyr?</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Mendac. V. What can a Reader ſay of ſuch Men, that ſhall find, 1. That I never wrote a word to juſtifie his Death; but only once told the Papiſts that they were unmeet Accuſers, as being guilty of more? 2. I preach'd againſt it. 3. I wrote againſt it, over and over. 4. It coſt me the dear Labour and Sufferings of almoſt two years in the Army, to have kept them in Loyal Obedience. 4. I called them oft and long to Repentance. Whence then did this Man find matter or occaſion for ſuch a ſhameleſs forgery? As for the Notion of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom,</hi> I leave Canonizing to the Righteous Judge.</p>
            <p>§ 19. Accuſ. VI. <hi>Who more oppoſed the Return of our preſent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign?</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Mendac. VI. 1. Ask for his proof of this. 2. The King teſtified the contrary. 3. See my Sermon before the Parliament the day before he was Voted Home. 4. And my Sermon to the City on their Thankſgiving called, <hi>Right Rejoicing.</hi> 5. Would the King have made ſuch an Enemy his <hi>Chaplain</hi> and a <hi>Biſhop?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Truth is this, There were two Seaſons that called to me for my Endeavours for the King. The firſt was at <hi>Worcester</hi> Fight, and at Sir <hi>George Booth's</hi> Fight: At that time I openly declared the Army to be in a ſtate of Rebellion, in which none ſhould own them: But I durſt not meddle on either ſide: Not for the Cromwellians, their Cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinful: Not to reſtore the King, becauſe I foreſaw all the Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Silencings, Perſecutions and Calamity to the Kingdom which his Biſhops and other revengeful Inſtruments would bring in: Nor was I deceived in expecting moſt that hath befallen us of twenty nine years ſince, ſave that I thought that Popery and Cruelty would have made a ſpeedier progreſs than they did: Not knowing by what methods God would ſtop them. And I durſt not haſten Gods Judgments on the Land, till I knew that he required it.</p>
            <p>2. But afterward when I ſaw that the Army caſt all into utter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and that Gods Providence had reſolved the doubt, how much I did towards a due ſubjection to the King, is not a thing that wanteth evidence. I cannot Repent that I was not one that brought into <hi>England</hi> that Tribe of Revengeful deſtructive Prelates and their Agents, that <hi>corrupted</hi> and <hi>divided</hi> the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 20. Accuſ. VII. [<hi>Or hath been as active in making the Government uneaſie.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Uneaſie? To whom? To the King? I have his Teſtimony to the contrary: He ſent D. <hi>Lauderdale</hi> to me purpoſely to invite me to receive the Teſtification of his Favour and Acceptance? Read his Character of us in his Gracious Declaration. Read Mr. <hi>Gaches</hi> Letter to me for the King, tranſlated and publiſhed by the means of Duke
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60957:29"/>
               <hi>Lauderdale.</hi> I know nothing that I did to make his Government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie, unleſs all my labour to have united his Subjects made it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie: Or unleſs his Confeſſor <hi>Huddleston</hi> was in the right, that he was before for the Roman Religion, and it was uneaſie to him to be ſtopt in promoting it: Of which confeſs I was oft guilty.</p>
            <p>But if he mean the Prelates Government, I believe I did much to make it uneaſie to them. I laboured by ſuch reaſons to have prevented their ejecting 2000 Godly Miniſters at once, and all the Cruelties and Miſeries that have followed, that it muſt needs be uneaſie to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences and Credit, while they could make no anſwer to the proof of their iniquity. I gave ſuch reaſons againſt their Lay Excommunicaters, and their Curſing Canons, and their cauſleſs and obſtinate dividing of the National Church by their frivolous, tearing Impoſitions, as muſt make Cruelty the more uneaſie. But (if I be not blind and mad) the Government of Church and State had been more eaſie, if they would have heard our pacificatory Requeſts.</p>
            <p>§ 21. Accuſ. VIII. [<hi>Or who hath or can do more than Mr. B. to renew all our troubles and confuſions?</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> By what? By ſtudying, praying, preaching, writing, and ſpeaking, and exemplary living for Unity and Peace; which God knoweth hath been my chief or ſecond ſtudy and labour theſe Forty four years; valuing the ſupernal Wiſdom, which is firſt Pure and then Peaceable. But methinks I hear the Legion that are his Army who was a Liar and Murderer from the beginning, ſay, <hi>What have we to do with thee? Art thou come to torment us before the time?</hi> But they have had leave to enter into the Swine: And O that their ſuffocation in the Sea of confuſion, occaſion not Chriſt to be driven out of our Coaſts, by them that love their Swine better than Chriſt.</p>
            <p>§ 22. Accuſ. IX. [<hi>So that I could not deviſe to give a better Epitome of the late Rebellion and Schiſm, than this account of Mr. B's Actions and Writings, which is an Abſtract of the riſe and progreſs of both in whom they yet both live, and with whom I wiſh they may both die.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe ſaith <hi>Morley</hi> of me, <hi>Ex uno diſce omnes.</hi> And though I unfeignedly think my ſelf worſe than the moſt Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Miniſters that I know, yet I intreat all Forreigners and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of future Ages to think no worſe of the Parliament and Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, than this Accuſation alloweth them to do. They were at leaſt no worſe than I; which I ſay becauſe the Accuſers ſeem to allow you this much: And all the reſt have not wrote above Sixſcore Books to make themſelves known, as I have done; and ſo by me you may know the worſt of them <hi>ex uno omnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sum of my wickedneſs is the Wars. But, 1. What's this to all the reſt of the Ejected Silenced Miniſters, of whom I think there is not living one of fifty or a hundred that ever medled with the Wars?
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60957:29"/>
(though one Archbiſhop did, and many that Conform.) And why would they never grant my earneſt requeſt that they would Silence on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly me, and all others that had any hand in the War (except the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts) and no more?</p>
            <p>2. I thought I had been a Rebel, if I had been againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Repreſentative Kingdom, and the <hi>ſalus populi,</hi> or <hi>bonum pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licum;</hi> and I thought the Legiſlative power was the Supream, and that this power was in King and Parliament conjunct, and that neither of them had power againſt the other, but that their Union was the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted <hi>ſumma poteſtas,</hi> which I was bound to endeavour, and their divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was the diſſolution of the Government: And I thought that all Subjects were under the Law, and that the King might not protect them from his Courts of Judicature.</p>
            <p>3. I knew that Points of Humane Policy and Laws, are not in our Creed, nor ſuch Controverſies ſo clearly decided in Scripture, as that Salvation ſhould lye on them. Though <hi>Rich. Hooker</hi>'s Opinion was for more popular power than mine, I find not that our Clergy place him in Hell for it or call him the moſt Bloody Inſtrument of Rebellion.</p>
            <p>4. I have elſewhere ſhewed, that the chief ſtream of the Writers of Policy, Laws, Hiſtory, Heathens, and Chriſtians, Papiſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, Lawyers and Divines, doth give ſo much more power to the people than I do that I have been put oft to confute them. Yet how is <hi>Hooker</hi> extolled by them? while I that have confuted his popular Principles am a Rebel: King <hi>Charles</hi> II. verbally by a Declaration diſo ned his Fathers Wars; he honoured many Generals, and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of the Parliaments Army with the higheſt Offices; One of them General <hi>Monk</hi> by a Parliament Presbyterian Army reſtored him; yet I that never was a Commander or Soldier, nor ever ſtroke or hurt Man, or drew a drop of Blood in War, am the great inſtance of the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion: Who did what I did to avoid the guilt of Rebellion; and to ſave <hi>England</hi> from being made like <hi>Ireland;</hi> where I thought it was Rebellion that Murdered two hundred thouſand: And we were then ſo ignorant of War, that we commonly thought that one Battel would have ended all, and ſetled peace.</p>
            <p>As for the Charge of Schiſm, I verily think that the Iriſh may as modeſtly transfer on the Proteſtants the charge of Rebellion, as King <hi>Charles</hi> II. his Prelates can lay on ſuch as I the charge of Schiſm, which they have ſo powerfully cauſed, and continued: He that will read my <hi>Search for the Schiſmatick,</hi> needeth no further proof: And he that will not, may keep his beloved Errour.</p>
            <p>§ 23. Accuſ. X. Anſwered: I ſaid that I was bred up under eight Reading School maſters, of whom divers were beggar'd by drinking.</p>
            <p>Muſt I repent of that? Or of diſliking ſuch Churchmen? <hi>O I ſhould have ſaid nothing ill of the dead!</hi> No nor of their living Succeſſors; for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60957:30"/>
hence is the rage: O how intolerable to theſe Men is reproof and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in compariſon of Sin!</p>
            <p>I muſt repent for telling, that one of my Reading Maſters, (that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly officiated in the Church) never preach'd but once, and that with the notorious ſigns of being Drunk in Eyes and Tongue, on that terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Text, <hi>Mat. 25. Go ye curſed, &amp;c.</hi> What enmity to the Church is it to complain of ſuch Men? But we were ſo often whipt when he came in Drunk, that made us as weary of him as the Fined and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned Miniſters are of the Perſecuting Biſhops.</p>
            <p>§ 24 Page 17. Accuſ. XI. [<hi>At Nineteen years of Age he had a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte againſt Biſhops as Perſecutors.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> But not as Biſhops; I cannot repent of diſtaſting Perſecutors: It was Born in me, and New born: May not one be a Chriſtian that loveth not Perſecution?</p>
            <p>§ 25. Accuſ XII [<hi>Whether Mr. B. made his Father a Rebel, or his Father him, he tells us his Father was twice a Priſoner.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> By this proof all the Impriſoned Nonconformiſts are Rebels: How eaſily can ſuch Prelates and their Agents make thouſands of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels: My Father lived in the Kings Quarters, and never was Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt, nor medled with Wars: But being plundered, was made Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of the Kings Taxes, and brought in all that was paid, but would not diſtrain, and for that was Impriſoned.

Here accuſing me for telling how Biſhop <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Confirmed me</hi> and many more, (<hi>ſaying a ſhort Collect without a word of Examination or Inſtruction</hi>) he heapeth up divers falſhoods. 1. <hi>That my Maſter was a Miniſter</hi> (I think) is falſe. 2. He querieth, <hi>Did not your Master Examine you? Anſ.</hi> He was the beſt of all my Maſters, and heard us ſay the Catechiſm, but never told us any thing of the ſence, nor ever examined whether we underſtood any of it. 3. He asketh, <hi>How know you but your Master certified of you? Anſ.</hi> If he certified that I underſtood what Baptiſmal Covenantings or Confirmation was, or much of the reſt, or what Conſent I gave to that Covenant, I doubt he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60957:30"/>
too much: And I being the Head Scholar, all the reſt were liker to be ignorant than I: (Except <hi>Richard Alleſtree,</hi> who though two or three years younger, had been diligently Catechized by a Nonconform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſter.)</p>
            <p>He ſaith, [<hi>This was Mr. B's fault, not the Biſhops.</hi>] <hi>Anſ.</hi> I confeſs I was faulty in not underſtanding as much at Fourteen years, as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood many years after. I cannot ſay that a Child of Seven years old is ſinleſs in not underſtanding all the Articles of Faith. But though it be the fault of the <hi>Ordained,</hi> if they ſeek it unqualified in groſs Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or Wickedneſs, the <hi>Ordainers</hi> will not long believe ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, that it is not their fault to Ordain ſuch. He that believeth Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and Mr. <hi>Eldersfield</hi> (two the Learnedſt Conformiſts of this Age) of the grand importance of the ſolemn underſtanding and ſerious owning of the Baptiſmal Covenant in Confirmation, when young Men paſs into the rank of Communicants, ſhould ſhed ſtreams of Tears, to think how contrary common practice is hereto, and how this Ordinance is not only fruſtrate, but turned to a deluding Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            <p>§ 28. Accuſ. XV. [<hi>He was a Controuler of Biſhops at Fourteen.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> A meer Forgery: I liked the ſport: It was too long after that I diſliked it.</p>
            <p>§ 29. Accuſ. XVI. Page 19. I am reproached that the Grave Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Conforming Miniſters, that kept me from Nonconformity, were ſuch as had rather have had the Church rid of ſuch dividing Things] whence he ſlanderouſly concludeth that [<hi>they waited an opportunity to be active in Ruining the Church.</hi> Becauſe when Conformity was forbidden by the Parliament, they forſook not their Flock: What can eſcape Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical reproach when a great part of the County had ſcarce any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pious Miniſters but four or five ſuch as theſe, and they ſhall be falſly branded by ſuch as never knew them.</p>
            <p>§ 30. Accuſ. XVII. (His charge of my <hi>ignorant Subſcribing at my Ordination, I confeſs and lament;</hi> and beg of God to forgive.)</p>
            <p>But the report of <hi>raining Manna at</hi> Bridgnorth, <hi>at my coming thither,</hi> is the Forgery of his Trade: A Grain like dryed <hi>Rie</hi> rained there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a year before my coming thither, (which I kept ſome of long, and the like at <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> about two years ago.) And he forgeth that there were <hi>ſix Pariſhes at Bridgnorth,</hi> becauſe I ſaid there were <hi>ſix under the Ordinaries Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 31. Accuſ. XVIII. He accuſeth me for being <hi>againſt the</hi> Et caetera <hi>Oath, and Canons,</hi> and yet ſaith not a word to prove it lawful, but through me condemneth not only the Parliament that condemned it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Diviſion, but even the long Parliament that made all their cruel Laws, that never would own that Oath, or authorize thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons; nor any Parliament to this day.</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:60957:31"/>
            <p>§ 32. Accuſ. XIX. [<hi>He was acquainted Forty years ago with many Aged Nonconforming Miniſters, (and probably Confederate with them,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes; in the Baptiſmal Covenant, renouncing the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil: I repent not of that: Nor take it for a ſin to have known them.</p>
            <p>§ 33. Accuſ. XX. <hi>Prejudices againſt Conformity poſſeſt him from his Youth.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not unleſs Cainiſm be Conformity, or twenty four years old be my Youth, ſuch as your Writings, and Doings, are an ill cure of prejudice.</p>
            <p>§ 34. Accuſ. XXI. <hi>Is, that I broke my Oaths to the King and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Superiors whom I was bound to obey</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I thought verily that I broke neither, I Swore not to obey the Convocation, much leſs againſt the Parliament, in unlawful Canons and impoſed Oaths, never yet Authorized: I took the Oaths of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance and Supremacy, and thought that defending the Land againſt Armed Delinquents, and Iriſh, and Papiſts Inſurrections, had been no breach of it. If I was miſtaken the Lord convince me and forgive me: But your way is unapt to it.</p>
            <p>Let the Reader peruſe but Sir <hi>Edward Deering's</hi> Speeches in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, proving that this <hi>Et caetera</hi> Oath was ſinfully impoſed without Authority, by them that were neither a Convocation, a Synod or Commiſſioners; the ſame Man that ſpake ſo much for Liturgy and Epiſcopacy, againſt Presbytery and Independency: And I doubt not but it was flat Perjury that by it we were required to Swear, <hi>viz.</hi> [That the deſcribed <hi>Et caetera Government of the Church ought ſo to ſtand.</hi>]</p>
            <p>And was I perjured for refuſing Perjury?</p>
            <p>As a ſummary Confutation of a multitude of his Lies, I at once tell the Reader, that I neither was nor am for the way called Presbytery, Independency, or the Engliſh Dioceſane way: But for the mixture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed excellently by <hi>Grotius de Imper. Sum. Pot.</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Deering,</hi> whoſe Counſel I wiſh'd that the Parliament had followed. And that I was and am far from defending the irregular Actions of the Parliament, or any Members of it: Tho' they thought that the Delinquents had put a neceſſity on them to overgo their own Judgments to pleaſe the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the Indiſcreet and Schiſmatical part of the Nonconformiſts, I doubt not but they did ill herein, and ſhould have truſted God in the uſe of none but lawful means: I believe that a few Men by Craft and unwearied Induſtry over-reach'd many that knew not what they did: Sir <hi>Edward Deering</hi> nameth ſome of them, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Sir <hi>H. V.</hi> Sir <hi>A. H.</hi> and <hi>O. C.</hi> that over-reach'd his own upholders and all the reſt: I believe they did ill to excite and encourage diſorder and tumults on pretence of Petitioning, and of ſcurrilous defamations
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60957:31"/>
of ſuch Men as the Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Dering,</hi> and ſome other worthy Men, and ſo many good Biſhops as they abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And yet that I durſt not for theſe miſcarriages, conſent to give up the Kingdoms Parliamentary Security for its preſent and future Safety and Liberties, I ſtill think is conſonant to the moſt common Principles of Lawyers, Politick Writers, Hiſtorians, Divines, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, Papiſts and Heathens.</p>
            <p>Even the late great Lord Chancellor <hi>Hide</hi> ſat Chairman of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Parliament that received the Petitions againſt Epiſcopacy, Root and Branch, and made ſuch Speeches againſt the Delinquents as I dare not juſtifie. But he forſook them when they quite over-went him.</p>
            <p>If the King of <hi>England</hi> had a War with the <hi>French,</hi> and I knew that his Cauſe were bad, I would not defend his bad Cauſe, but I would in his Army defend the Kingdom, againſt thoſe that would Captivate it by Conqueſt: For the Kingdom doth not forfeit its ſafety by the Kings miſdoing: And if any ſay, [<hi>Then the King ſhall be defended in all his injuries how bad ſoever,</hi>] I would anſwer, [That is by accident, it is the <hi>Kingdom</hi> that I defend, and <hi>Him</hi> as a means to defend the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and not to juſtifie his ſin: I leave that to God: What a caſe is a Kingdom in if it muſt Fight againſt it ſelf, and its repreſenting ſecurity, as oft as its Repreſentatives miſcarry by any ſiniſter means? And that all that are to be judged by the chief Judicature, ſhall Fight to Conquer them, if the King do but bid them? If the ſafety of this Kingdom be once put into the Truſt of the King alone, the Conſtitution is changed, and all Enſlaved.</p>
            <p>§ 35. Accuſ. XXII. He ſaith that [<hi>in</hi> 1640. <hi>I entred into a War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Whereas the War in <hi>England</hi> began not till 1642. And I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver medled in War but as aforementioned long after.</p>
            <p>§ 36. Accuſ. XXIII. He ſaith by [<hi>the Treatiſe of Dioceſane Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy meditated</hi> 1640. <hi>I broached Faction in the Church, my Pen diſdaining to be leſs active than my Sword.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I never ſtruck with a Sword in War or Peace. 2. Did Meditating <hi>broach</hi> a Book that was not publiſhed nor written till thirty years after? 3. Is it Faction to give reaſons why I Swore not to Faction, even that Antiepiſcopal ſort of Dioceſanes that put down many hundred Churches and Biſhops to ſet up the Name and Image of one? 4. Why is not that Book anſwered to this day, when ſo many Nonconformiſts have Challenged, Called and Beg'd for an Anſwer to it? Will a Lying Scorn ſatisfie any Conſcionable Nonconformiſt? 5. That Book owneth ſo much of Biſhops, and Dioceſanes, and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, (which Sir <hi>Edward Dering</hi> condemned) that theſe Men now ſhew that it is not ſuch as I only, but ſuch as <hi>Grotius, Spalatenſis, Uſher,</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:60957:32"/>
               <hi>Hall,</hi> yea moſt of the great Writers for Epiſcopacy (of whoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I have there given a particular account) whom he condemneth for Faction and Enmity to the Church. I have written againſt the Pope too: And is not that as bad? I am ſure many Papiſts write more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Epiſcopacy than I.</p>
            <p>§ 37. Accuſ. XXIV. [<hi>It's probable his Church Hiſtory had its concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the ſame time.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ</hi> About Forty years after 1640. Forty years breaks no ſquare with this ſort of Men: I would this lort of Hiſtory were not too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with them.</p>
            <p>§ 38. Accuſ. XXV. Page 23 [<hi>He feigneth me in my Church Hiſtory to commend all the Hereticks, and omit what is good of the Fathers and Martyrs, and write only their faults.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It ſeems he thought that without reading the Book that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth him, his Faction would take his word that he ſaith true.</p>
            <p>§ 39 Accuſ. XXVI The like he ſaith of my <hi>reproaching Councils,</hi> becauſe I ſhew the miſcarriages of many, and our Biſhops that plead for a Forreign Juriſdiction, dare yet own but ſix or eight General Councils.</p>
            <p>§ 40. Accuſ. XXVII Page 25. He reciteth my mention of the former courſes, of undoing Men for hearing a Sermon (of a Godly Conformiſt) at the next Pariſh when they had none at home, (and for Faſting and Praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) And he taketh it for my crime, to call theſe ungodly Perſecutions crimes: So that he that is not for them, while they are tearing the Church, and extirpating ſerious Piety, is againſt them. So do the Papiſts accuſe them that blame their Murders and Inquiſitions.</p>
            <p>§ 41. Accuſ. XXVIII. Becauſe I ſaid, The War was begun in our Streets by the ungodly drunken Rabble, ſeeking our Lives, he ſaith, [<hi>In plain Engliſh Mr.</hi> B. <hi>with other Reformers put themſelves into Arms, ſeizing on the Kings Forts, and making them Garriſons againſt the King, (and this before King or Parliament had any Armies.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> In plain Engliſh this Lie is ſhameleſs. Unleſs a poor hired Chamber was the Kings Fort, I ſeized on none. The firſt time the drunken Rabble roſe up againſt me, was for preaching Original Sin: They ſaid that I ſlandered their Children. The next was for Reading the Parliaments Order to deface the Pictures of the Trinity: The third was by bringing in Souldiers, that drove me away. And it was long after this ere I had a private Lodging in <hi>Coventry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 42. Accuſ. XXIX. Page 26. He maketh the repetition of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery a proof that I was guilty of Perjury. 1. Becauſe I was prejudiced againſt the Biſhops at Nineteen, and yet at Ordination took the Oath (to obey my Ordinary <hi>in Licitis &amp; Honeſtis.</hi>) <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I did not Swear an approbation of Perſecution. I was not then prejudiced againſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60957:32"/>
Epiſcopacy, but againſt the ſin of Biſhops. May not a Man diſown ſuch ſhameleſs Liars as ſome Miniſters are, without diſowning the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry? 2. (<hi>I was prejudiced againſt Biſhop</hi> Morton <hi>at Fourteen.</hi>) <hi>Anſ.</hi> Utterly falſe: I honoured him to his death. But when I came to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtanding I diſliked turning Confirmation to a meer Ceremony. (For the right uſe of which I have written a Treatiſe agreeing to Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi>)</p>
            <p>3. He nameth [<hi>my omitting the Croſs and Surplice.</hi>] <hi>Anſ.</hi> I never Sware nor Promiſed to uſe them; being in no ſtation that obliged me to it: And was under an Ordinary that required it not. And I have confeſt my ſin in rath ſubſcribing to their lawfulneſs.</p>
            <p>§ 43. Accuſ. XXX. Page 27. He tragically reciteth the reaſons I alledged why I was for the Parliament: But his confutation is only by an Exclamation how bad I was, as worſe than <hi>Cook</hi> and <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> as if I had been for the death of the King. When he knoweth that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was broken up by <hi>Cromwell</hi> for being for the Kings Reſtoration and their Union: And that a Faction called the Rump did this as <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well's</hi> Confederates. I believe I did more againſt that Faction than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch as he.</p>
            <p>§ 44. Accuſ. XXXI. Page 27, 28. [<hi>With what Heart could he be an Eye-witneſs of the Inhumane Butcheries that had been made in almoſt every Fight from the beginning of the Wars?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> A Lie ſo groſs that it feigneth me to ſee far off where I never was. I have anſwered it before: I was an Eye-witneſs of many of Gods provident diſpoſals, and an Ear-witneſs of more. I ſaw the Field where they fought near <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and <hi>Edgehill,</hi> and <hi>Nantwich,</hi> and I ſaw many Garriſons (<hi>Wem, Leiceſter, Shrewsbury, Exeter, Sherburne, Briſtol, Winchester,</hi>) that had been taken: But I ſaw not the Fights at any one of theſe: But that at <hi>Langport</hi> that ended the Field War I ſaw afar off, but ſaw none kill'd, for they fled I think before a Man was kill'd.</p>
            <p>§ 45. Accuſ. XXXII. I repent not of <hi>ſaying that I was reſcued from many dangers:</hi> Nor that <hi>I had many tedious Nights and Days,</hi> (in that Army which after <hi>Naſeby</hi> Fight I hazarded my Life and ſpent my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to have undeceived) [<hi>and had many doleful ſights and tidings.</hi>] I ſaw the Graves and ſome of the Corps in Ditches near <hi>Edgehill,</hi> of the Parliaments Souldiers there kill'd, and many that lay unburied: When after I lived in peace at <hi>Coventry,</hi> how oft were Souldiers of that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon brought home Mortally wounded, and many ſlain: Few Weeks paſt in which we heard not of Fights in Fields or Garriſons: Which I thought it lawful to call doleful tidings.</p>
            <p>§ 46. Accuſ. XXXIII. Becauſe I named the doleful Fights at <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester, Edgehill. Newberry, Nantwich, Montgomery, Horncastle, Naſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, (York,) Langport, &amp;c.</hi> he addeth, [<hi>It ſeems he was preſent in theſe Fights.</hi>]</p>

            <p>§ 47. Accuſ. XXXIV. [<hi>He had travelled over the moſt of</hi> England (<hi>to purſue the War.] Anſ.</hi> It was [<hi>much</hi>] and not [<hi>moſt</hi>] and it was to have prevented the Change of Government, and not to <hi>purſue the War</hi> that I went</p>

            <p>§ 49. Accuſ. XXXVI. His next is a common Accuſation of me by his Party, that I ſpeak of <hi>Brook, Prin, Hambden</hi> and <hi>White as of Men in Heaven.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I think ſo ſtill: <hi>Prin</hi> and <hi>White</hi> were never Souldiers: Our Creed containeth not any Article that decideth Controverſies about the various forms of Government: Chriſt never told us how much of the Supremacy was in <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and how much in the Senate and People, and which of them had the Legiſlative Power: Nor whether <hi>England</hi> be an Abſolute or a Limited Monarchy; nor whether the Parliament have part of the Legiſlative and Self-defending Power. And thoſe that beſt knew theſe Men (eſpecially <hi>Hambden</hi> and <hi>White</hi>] took them for Men in all other reſpects of Great Wiſdom, Piety and Honeſty: If among the old Romans all the Civil Wars between the Senate and the Emperors, and one Emperor and another, (when of Forty ſcarce Ten died a Natural Death, but were Murdered) had inferred the Deſtruction and Damnation of all that were againſt the Cenſuring ſide, how few would have eſcaped? When ſetting up Emperors and killing them was ſo common, that Souldiers ſet the Crown to Sale. I never heard that <hi>Brutus,</hi> or <hi>Cato,</hi> or <hi>Cicero,</hi> or <hi>Seneca,</hi> or <hi>Lucan</hi> and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might not have their Virtues praiſed, and that above their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, though they died as eſteemed Rebels. I am ſure theſe Men that reproach me for this Charity, have a Law to turn me and all Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts out of the Miniſtry, if we were to bury ſuch a Man and would not profeſs our Hope of his Salvation: For they bind us to do it of every individual perſon buried in the Land, except the <hi>Unbaptized, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate</hi> and <hi>Self-Murderers.</hi> And <hi>exceptio firmat regulam in non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe the Sum of his Accuſations is the <hi>War,</hi> the <hi>War,</hi> I will once more give him a Summary Anſwer.</p>
            <p>If he mean the War before the new modelled Army, and new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which left out [<hi>for the King</hi>] after <hi>Naſeby</hi> Fight, I did more
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60957:34"/>
againſt that new Cauſe and War than he, and perhaps many ſuch as he: If he mean the firſt War ſtated by the Parliament Commiſſions [<hi>for the King and Parliament</hi>] I was in it and for it: Becauſe,</p>
            <p>1. He that is for the Higheſt Power in a Civil War, is of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſide (<hi>caeteris paribus</hi>) than he that is againſt it; but they that were for King and Parliament were for the Higheſt Power in our Civil War.</p>
            <p>Proved: They that were for them that have the Legiſlative Power, were for them that had the Higheſt Power (as <hi>Morley</hi> confeſſeth and almoſt all others.) But they that were for King and Parliament were for them that had the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> Power. <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>What Hypocriſie is it to ſhoot at the King and ſay you fight for him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The King proteſted to be for the Parilament (as his <hi>Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> Half Crowns ſhew) while he fought againſt their Armies and Perſons: <hi>Ergo</hi> the Parliament might more clearly be for the King while they fought againſt his Army and not his Perſon, though in the Field.</p>
            <p>2. They knew that the King had diſcretion enough to keep his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon out of the reach of Danger: And ſo he did: At <hi>Edgehill</hi> he ſtood on the Hill (as I heard) and look'd down on the Fight in the Field. At <hi>Naſeby</hi> where he was neareſt he was ſafe (but that was after the firſt Cauſe and War.) I never heard elſe that he came near.</p>
            <p>3. Elſe any Traytor, that could poſſeſs the Kings Perſon, and carry him about (as they did <hi>Henry</hi> VI.) ſhould be for the King and all againſt him that would reſcue him.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>He was willingly with his Army.] Anſ.</hi> He may fight for the King that doth it againſt his Will, while he doth it not to hurt his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Prerogative or Rights. We Sware not to be for all the <hi>Will</hi> of the King. If in a Paſſion he would kill Himſelf, his Son, his Lords, his Parliament, yea, or would but Raviſh a Woman, he may be held and reſiſted.</p>

No more than the King's Ships or Armies muſt wilfully caſt away Ships and Lives, for want of Conduct, becauſe a Man that hath no tolerable skill is in Poſſeſſion.

120 <hi>l.</hi> of which I never deſired or ask'd for a Penny: And if Mr. <hi>Dance</hi> when forced out had right to his Benefice I that was forced away had right to my Salary: Which yet I think was no good Title in him or me. But he was ſequeſtred when I was in another Countrey not like to live: And the Sequeſtration put into the hands of divers of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to maintain one to Officiate. They offered it me, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it: And told them that I would take neither Sequeſtration nor Paſtoral Cure, but my former <hi>Lecture;</hi> but if they would get a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Paſtor, let them take care to pay him: For I would have out of the Vicaridge but the 60 <hi>l.</hi> that the Vicar was bound to pay: And becauſe I refuſed a Living of 400 <hi>l.</hi> or 500 <hi>l.</hi> to be with them I would try other ways to make my Stipend 100 <hi>l.</hi> by getting for <hi>Mitton</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which had but ten pound a year, an Augmentation of forty pound from the Parliament <hi>aliunde;</hi> and in ſum while I was there, the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Vicaridge was thus paid; <hi>viz.</hi> forty pound a year to Mr. <hi>Dance,</hi> about twenty pound to the Crown and Poor, and Taxes; ten pound to the old Curate of <hi>Mitton,</hi> which was all he had before: ſixty pound to me, and the reſt to a truly faithful Miniſter that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed once a day at <hi>Kiderminſter</hi> and once at <hi>Mitton,</hi> and did the reſt of the Offices. And the Augmentation added from the Parliament made up my ſixty pound to be eighty pound, and the Rent of a few Rooms in the top of another Mans old Houſe. And I had no more: Nor did ever ſet my foot in the Vicaridge Houſe, much leſs offer to put out Mr. <hi>Dance;</hi> nor had we any diſagreement. And when he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, he freely gave me a full diſcharge for all between him and me.</p>
            <p>But the Sequeſtrators had notice that another was like to be put in againſt their will if I were not: And thereupon without me they got the Committee to paſs an Order as to me; and they kept this Order for their own indempnity, till King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Army came to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and then they brought it me, and deſired me if I were put to it, not to diſclaim it.</p>
            <p>And to make all ſure when I came to them after my return from the Army, I got all the Magiſtrates and chief of the Town, to Subſcribe their Names, that they received me only as their Lecturer, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the Paſtoral Charge and Sequeſtration.</p>

            <p>Indeed when <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s proud rebellious Army came and maſtered Parliament and City, and about 150 of their Members forbore coming to the Houſe, they paſt divers ſlaviſh Votes, among which was that of [<hi>No more Addreſſes to the King,</hi>] when he refuſed their four Acts: But they recalled that Vote, and were caſt out for recalling it, and Voting Conſent to the Kings Conceſſion.

            <p>§ 66. Once more, I tell this Accuſer and the World, that I am ſo far from juſtifying King or Parliament, from the beginning, progreſs, or ending of this War, that I think both ſides deeply guilty of very hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſin: And I cannot tell whether I know a Man living that hateth War more than I hate it: While I medled in it, it was far a more ſad
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60957:38"/>
and hateful Life to me, than my abode in Priſon was when the Church Defenders laid me there with an unſolvable Fine. The truth is, both ſides began they knew not what: I knew not a Man but Sir <hi>Francis Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſole</hi> that knew what War was, or foreſaw what was like to come of it. Both ſides thought it would be prevented by the Countreys for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the other ſide, or that one Fight would end it. And no Man can tell juſt <hi>where,</hi> and <hi>when,</hi> and by <hi>whom</hi> it was begun: No more than juſt when a Chronical Diſeaſe begins in Man. Only I am ſure that <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſitively</hi> it began in that <hi>diviſion of Minds, Hearts and Lives,</hi> which is common in the World between them that Love a Life of Serious Godlineſs, and cannot Love Wickedneſs, and them that Hate a Godly Life becauſe it's againſt their Luſt and Carnal Intereſt. Not that every Adverſary to the Parliament was a <hi>Cainite,</hi> but that through the Land an Enmity between the <hi>Seriouſly Godly,</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane encouraged</hi> by Phariſaical Ceremonious Formaliſts, was a War in our Bowels, ready to break forth upon the firſt advantages. And the Religious Party (as in all former Ages) had many young ignorant Novices, that by Pride ran into Extreams, being ſelf-conceited, and unruly, and ready by Schiſm or petulant Cenſoriouſneſs to vilifie all that be not of their Sects, and to pretend Fanatick Inſpirations for their Errours. As the contrary Party was prone to be ſo Jealous of their beloved Dominion, Wealth, and Eaſe, and Honour, as to take ſuch for intolerable Enemies that flattered them not in their Worldly Pomp.</p>
            <p>Long did heart-burnings continue between theſe diſcordant Parties, one ſide <hi>blaming,</hi> and the other ſide <hi>ruining</hi> thoſe that were againſt them: Till <hi>Laud</hi>'s attempts for Innovation, ſtirred up ſuch <hi>oppoſition</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>diſtaſte</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> as I cannot juſtifie. The Parliament encouraged by the Scots went higher in provoking the King than they ought: And the King too much occaſioned their Jealouſie that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have Invaded Property and Liberty, and to ſubdue them by force if they reſtrained or puniſhed the Executioners of his Illegal Will. But this brake out by ſuch degrees, that no Man can name the beginning. As a ſmall breach in a Pond of Water groweth wider till it let out the whole: And as Perſonal Duels begin in a word, or a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, and proceed to wrath, and then to reproach, and thence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. When Diviſion was the Death of the Conſtituted Form of Government, both ſides ſhould have <hi>hated</hi> and <hi>feared</hi> it more than either did. But the Parliament thought the King would ſoon return as deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And the Devil among us all was as if he had caſt among Boys red hot pieces of Braſs or Iron, and they ſcrambled for it, thinking by the Colour that it was Gold, till it ſtuck to their Fingers and burnt them to the Bone. And the dread of 200000 Murdered in <hi>Ireland</hi> put ſuch a pannick fear in the Antipapiſts in <hi>England,</hi> as darkened their Wits.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60957:39"/>
And yet if the Captain and Mariners fall out by folly, the Ship may be preſerved by the innocent. If the Citizens could not agree about quenching the Fire in 1666. the Inhabitants may endeavour it, and pull down Houſes to that end without the guilt of injury to the Owners. I think that King and Parliament grievouſly ſinned (but not equally) in doing ſo much to cauſe and no more to prevent a Civil War: I would they had hearkened to <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s Speech, and other Mens heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing motions 1641. But who in the beginning fore-knows the end? And when once the breach is made, uſually there is no hope left of any better end than one of the two Parties ruin. True is the old ſaying, <hi>He that draweth his Sword againſt his King muſt throw away the Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard.</hi> When all mutual Truſt is gone, all hope of Reconciliation is gone.</p>
            <p>The preſent ſtate of <hi>England</hi> is a lively Expoſition of the beginning of that miſerable War. We were thus in fear of Popery and Slavery here of late. The Murder of 200000 in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Papiſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in to the King in <hi>England</hi> was as loud an Alarm, as King <hi>James</hi> his Liberty of Conſcience here. The Archbiſhop and Biſhops, and the Lay Church Lords and Patrons here had Sworn or Promiſed <hi>against taking Arms againſt the King on any pretence what ſoever.</hi> They did not<note place="margin">☞</note> 
               <hi>all own King William</hi>'s Title to the Crown: Yet they thought it lawful to save the Kingdom from a miſgoverning King, and the Kings own Kindred, Lords, Army and Clergy forſook him, and joyned with him that came in againſt him: They meant it not as owning then the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Right to the Crown, nor as <hi>diſowning</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> but to <hi>ſave the Kingdom;</hi> and it proved contrary to their expectation that without Blood the turn of the Nation turned the Government.</p>
            <p>Juſt ſo the firſt beginners of the reſiſtance of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt his Army intended no change of the Government, and they thought that the War would have been as ſoon almoſt ended as begun, as King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>'s was here; but when it was once begun reconciliation became im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: And one or others muſt be ruined: Yet we that owned not the miſcarriages of either ſide, but thought King and Parliament great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinful, thought it an abſolute Duty to do our beſt to ſave the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, from the moſt threatning danger. And we thought that the Maſſacre of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Papiſts in <hi>England,</hi> the malignity of moſt of the Kings Adherents, and the proſpect of ſuch an Army of Delinquents Conquering a Parliament, and putting all the Land into the Sole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the King, who was himſelf in the power of Papiſts and Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, did clearly tell us where the preſent danger of the Kingdom lay.

            </p>
            <p>§ 67. Yet I muſt truely ſay (though it diſpleaſe the guilty) that the effects were quite different on the Land, from what the Malignants commonly report: They would falſly perſwade the World, that all ancient Piety was deſpiſed, the Creed, Lords Prayer and Decalogue, and all ſober Miniſters caſt out, and Tub preachers ſet up to vent their Nonſence. The truth is, among 10000 of the Clergy about 300 or more were turn'd out as Ignorant and Scandalous, and with them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly ſome for being for the King againſt the Parliament: The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I know not, but conjecture that there might be an hundred ſuch at leaſt. In the places of theſe the moſt ſeriouſly Religious young Men that the Univerſities would afford, with ſome few old Nonconformiſts, and but few) ſuch as the Pariſhioners choſe were ſet up: Moſt of theſe young Men were ſuch as had no hand in the Wars, but were Lads or young Students while the War continued. It pleaſed God, that very many of them, became ſuch fervent, able Preachers, that a great change followed among their Hearers, and multitudes of the Ignorant, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd and Worldlings became Serious, Godly, Chriſtians. And the younger ſort grew up accordingly.</p>
            <p>For inſtance, in the County of <hi>Worceſter</hi> where I lived, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was one Family that minded Piety, or the Life to come, or Prayed, or Read the Scripture, there were many after that did it. In the Town where I lived, where there was before one or two Houſes in a Street that worſhipped God by Prayer in their Families, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided Profaneneſs, and minded the Concerns of their Souls, at laſt there was ſcarce more than two Houſes on a Street-ſide, that did not learn the Catechiſm read the Scripture, pray and live ſoberly, and this in great love and peace, and humility towards others; commonly diſowning the Cromwellians, and Sectarians Diſloyalties, Rebellions and Schiſins.</p>
            <p>But indeed when the Sectaries got dominion, many Anabaptiſts and Self conceited Novices ſet up themſelves for Preachers where they could get Hearers; but the ſober godly people kept ſo much Concord and Integrity, that theſe others were but here and there, and that as a diſgraced broken Sect, as the Quakers be among us now. But <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon</hi> took the advantage of the ignorance and badneſs of the Pariſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in <hi>Wales,</hi> to ſet up Itinerant Anabaptiſts and Separatiſts in many places.</p>
            <p>This is the truth of the Conſequents about Religion: And it fell out that the Cromwellians and Anabaptiſts profeſſing more Zeal for God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs than ordinary, did much of their work by ſuppreſſing ſin and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60957:40"/>
and countenancing Godlineſs: Which hath taught us to wiſh that of two Evils, rather <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> than <hi>Malignity</hi> may be in power. It's better Godlineſs be promoted for evil Ends, than hated and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
            <p>68. Whereas therefore the Dioceſane Church of <hi>England</hi> excluſive of all Nonconformiſts, and ſuch as theſe Men accuſe, is ſo oft called, <hi>The beſt Church in the World:</hi> It muſt mean that it is beſt in <hi>Conſtitution</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> or in the <hi>Men</hi> that are Miniſters and Members. If the firſt be their meaning, 1. The beſt Laws without the beſt Men never make the beſt Church. 2. Is one ſole Biſhop over a Thouſand or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hundred Pariſhes without any Biſhop or Paſtoral Church under him a better Form of Government, than the contrary that was continued for many hundred years? <note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Clarkſons</hi> proofs.</note> and deſcribed by Archbiſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> and others. 2. Is a Church Governed by Lay Civilians decretive uſe of the Keys ſo much better than that which is Governed by the Keys in the hands of the Clergy only? 3. Is a Church Governed by Canons that <hi>ipſo facto Excommunicate all</hi> that affirm any of their Offices, Ceremonies or Forms, to have any thing ſinful, better than thoſe that unite in things neceſſary, and bear with ſuch as theſe? 4. Are Biſhops and Deans choſen by Kings (perhaps Papiſts) and Incumbents choſen by any that can buy a Preſentation, better than thoſe that are choſen by the Clergy and People, and Inveſted by the Prince and Patron. 5. Is a Church where the ignorant, ſinful and unwilling are forced to Communicate, unleſs they will lye Beggar'd in Goals, better than thoſe that receive none to Communion but the Deſirers?</p>
            <p>2. But if it be the beſt Church in the World for <hi>Men,</hi> they ſhould let others praiſe them rather than their own Mouths. Are they ſo much better Men than the Nonconformiſts? Do their Lives ſhew it? Doth credible fame ſpeak it? Though Mr. <hi>White</hi> was blamed for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the Names of ſuch as by credible Oaths were ejected for Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, or other Scandal, this was no proof that they were the beſt Men in the World? Nor yet that of 10000 that Conformed 8000 of them had Conformed before to the Directory, and Declared their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Conſent to the altered Common Prayer Book before ever they ſaw it (as I have proved)</p>
            <p>Whereas I remember not that ever I heard of one Nonconformiſt theſe twenty eight years that was accuſed and puniſhed for any ſuch crime, unleſs preaching Chriſts Goſpel be a crime, even when Power and Malice watcht for advantages againſt them, and crouded them into Goals for preaching and praying. Nor do I remember more than two ſingle inſtances of Im norality by credible accuſations of fame, (which was of Fornication lamented) in all theſe years. But alas how different is the common fame of too many of the publick Clergy! And are theſe the beſt Men in all the World?</p>

            <p>This Man ſingleth out me for one of the worſt Men living, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Morley</hi> bid Men judge of all the reſt by me; [<hi>ab uno diſce omnes.</hi>] And he was accounted one of the moſt Eminent of the Clergy for Parts and Orthodoxneſs: One Book againſt me called his Letter, is moſt ſhameleſs for untruths in publick matters of Fact: His laſt and greateſt is to prove againſt me that the Parliament hath no part in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Power, nor the whole Kingdoms any right of ſelf defence againſt any Commiſſioned by the King on any pretence whatſoever. This Accuſer is an Eminent Member of the beſt Church in the World: Is this bundle of his groſs untruths a proof that he is one of the beſt Men in the World. He ſaith that the <hi>Good that I wrote was for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Ends.</hi> And what ſhould move a Man in pain and expectation of ſpeedy death to write above Sixſcore Books great and ſmall, that are contrary to the bent of his own Heart? And for that which he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievouſly would overthrow? To ſpend his Life againſt his own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections?</p>
            <p>§ 70. Accuſ. LIII. <hi>His next charge is that</hi> [<hi>I was employed in aſſiſting the Commiſſioners for Sequeſtration.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> A downright Lie: I never had any thing to do for them or with them. Another ſort called Commiſſioners for <hi>Approbation</hi> that were to judge of Men for Inſtitution upon Preſentations, would have had me to aſſiſt them, and I utterly refuſed it: But at laſt they got a trick, that when a Man was preſented that they would not approve, and yet would not incur the blame of rejecting him, they named three Countrey Miniſters near him, and ſaid, If thoſe approved him they would accept him: Three or four times they named me, and I refuſed to meddle in it: Till three Miniſters that were Epiſcopal and Royaliſts, againſt the Parliament told me, They ſhould loſe their Livings if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed them; and only for them did I deny my ſelf to do this Office. And now this Man makes it my crime to help his Party to Benefices: I never put out or rejected one of his Party. He dealeth with me juſt as Dr. <hi>Pearce</hi> did: When I deſired to reconcile the Religious ſort to the Ignorant multitude whom the Conformiſts had made their Church, I was ſtill met with the objection, (that they had nothing but the name
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60957:41"/>
and accidents of Chriſtians; that they ſcarce ever ſpake of God, or Chriſt, or the Life to come, unleſs in jeſt, or at the ſaying of their Service; that they never prayed in their Families; that multitudes of them were common Swearers, Lyars, Drunkards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To keep them from cenſuring the Conformiſts and their Churches over-much, and ſeparating groundleſly. I told them how ſome foul Sins that have got advantage by Cuſtom may ſtand with ſome degrees of Grace. And what doth this Doctor but turn this to my own reproach, as if I was for vicious Looſeneſs, and had deſcribed not <hi>theirs,</hi> but my <hi>own</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants; whenas, without this charitable Lenitive, I doubt it is above half the Conformable Laity that we muſt have turned from the Sacrament, and ſo have maimed the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>3. And as for the 60 <hi>l.</hi> before and after paid me as Lecturer, the Vicar's Bond for it was procured by his own Friends importunity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Wars.

After a deal of impertinent talk of the Army's ill uſage of the King (which 'tis like I did more againſt, than many ſuch as he,) he ſaith, [<hi>That I plead for the Obligation of the Solemn Covenant contumaciouſly, againſt the Authority of the whole Nation.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> If the Reader will find truth in this Man's Writings, he muſt firſt ſeparate it from all the Chaff of Untruths that covereth it. I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between 1. The Impoſing of that Covenant. 2. And the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it. 3. And the Keeping of the unlawful parts of it. 4. And the Keeping of the lawful and neceſſary parts. The three firſt I ſpeak againſt; the fourth is all the matter of our diſpute. That Covenant is alſo a Vow to God: Therein Men vowed to be againſt Popery, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs, Hereſie and Schiſm, and all that is againſt ſound Doctrine and Godlineſs; and to repent of Sin, and amend; and to defend the Perſon and Rights of the King. King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second took this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and ſo did his Lords and Knights, and others, at their Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and many that impoſed and took it were then, and ſome are yet alive. The Queſtion is Whether I. and all <hi>England,</hi> can and muſt be certain that this Vow bindeth neither King, Parliament-men, or any one living, to renounce Popery, Schiſm and Profaneneſs, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of Sin, and to defend the King. All the Corporations of <hi>England</hi> are conſtituted by a new Oath, that there is NO OBLIGATION from this Covenant, on ME OR ANY OTHER PERSON.] I gave the Reaſons why I durſt not ſwear this, leaving other Men's Conſciences to their Judge.</p>
            <p>Now either there is ſome ſuch Obligation, or there is not. If there is, and I ſhould venture, by an Oath, or a Subſcription, to juſtifie King, Parliament, and all the Corporations in <hi>England,</hi> in publick, national Perjury, What greater Wickedneſs could I commit? Would this be a Character of the beſt Church in the World, to have ſuch Miniſters?</p>
            <p>But if there be no Obligation from that Vow, to the things aforeſaid, 1. Dr. <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> and moſt ſober Caſuiſts are miſtaken: who ſay, That though a Vow be unlawfully impoſed, and unlawfully taken, and part of the Matter be unlawful to be kept, it bindeth us nevertheleſs to keep the neceſſary part. And what am I, that I ſhould ſwear or ſay that I am wiſer than all theſe Doctors, and ſure that they are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken?</p>

The Agreement accuſed is printed in a Book called <hi>Chriſtian Concord:</hi> The terms of it were, that Epiſcopal, and Presbyterians and Independents, ſhould agree in the practice of ſo much of the Miniſtry and Church-Diſcipline as they were agreed about in their Judgments or Principles, and be left in the reſt to their ſeveral Liberties. Was this a Crime? Is an Attempt of volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Concord and Peace the poyſon of Aſps? Or is not the poyſon of Aſps under their lips, that are haters of it, and have not known the way of peace? I have had thanks from <hi>Helvetia,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> for that <hi>Gildas Salvianus,</hi> and that pacificatory Attempt; which is to theſe Men the <hi>poyſon of Aſps.</hi>

Reader, the truth is this; There was a Petition by ſome, that thoſe, of what ſide ſoever, for King or Parliament, whoſe Inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency and Scandal was ſo great, as to render them utterly uncapable of Miniſtry, might not be allowed it: And I petitioned withal, that no Man might be caſt out, or reſtrained, for being for the King, againſt the Parliament, and their Cauſe. Is this ſo poyſonous?</p>
            <p>Doth not this Man more diſgrace his Church than me, that taketh it for the poyſon of Aſps to caſt out only the uncapable, and keep in the reſt?</p>
            <p>§ 78. Accuſ. LXI. He accuſeth me for telling the World truly how the Engliſh Prelates had encouraged the Enemies of ſerious Godlineſs in the Land, and at how much cheaper a rate a Man might be a Swearer, a Drunkard, a Whoremonger, an open Scorner of Godlineſs, than to faſt and pray, or to hear a Conformiſt in the next Pariſh, when there was no Sermon at home.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> What doth the Man mean by rendering this odious? If he mean that all this was well done; and that, as in Armies, he hath moſt Honour that killeth moſt; ſo in their Church, he is the beſt Man that

doth moſt againſt ſerious Piety; this is to profeſs themſelves the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's Militia. But if he mean that I miſ-report the matter of fact, and this was not ſo, he may as well perſuade us that we lived not then in <hi>England,</hi> or that we knew not our Neighbours, or that Men ſpake not Engliſh. Can we chuſe but know that which every Corner in all the Land did ſpeak? Doth he ſay a word to confute all this? And it was a meritorious work to ſilence and impriſon with Rogues all that obeyed not their ungodly Canons; but it muſt go for a heinous Crime to feel their Malice, or blame their Cruelty.</p>
            <p>§ 79. Accuſ. LXII. Pag 66, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He accuſeth me, as accuſing King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of too much favouring the <hi>Grotian</hi> deſign of Union with the Papiſts.

Or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his ſworn Articles for Toleration, mentioned in <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>'s Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and others? 3.

Muſt we be brought under Ariſtocratical Popery, or French Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, merely by ſaying <hi>It is not Popery?</hi> And muſt the Land ſo tamely be perjured and enſlaved?</p>

            <p>§ 83. Accuſ. LXVI. His Accuſations of my holy Commonwealth are ſo ſlippery and trifling, that they call not for an Anſwer, unleſs it be that he taketh it for criminal, 1. That I told <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Army, that it was Treaſon to take Arms againſt the higheſt Power, as they did; and that if the higheſt Legiſlative Power was in the King alone, and not in King and Parliament conjunct, I muſt confeſs that I was guilty of death. 2. Or that I ſaid, <hi>I honoured all the Providences of God that made our Changes, though I abhorred the Deeds of Men that were guilty.</hi> And is it a Crime to honour God, and his Works? 3. Or that I deſired <hi>Richard Cromwell</hi> to govern well, and called my ſelf his <hi>Subject,</hi> though I never owned his Right to the Government; thinking that Chriſt directed me ſo far to ſubmit to the Poſſeſſor, when he paid Tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and ſent Lepers, and others,<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Defence.</note> to the High Prieſts, that were Uſurpers.

This Man makes Mr. <hi>Udal</hi> guilty of Sedition againſt the Queen, becauſe it was againſt the Biſhops, her Miniſters: And is it not as criminal to be againſt the Parliament? Are they ſo much lower than the Biſhops?</p>
            <p>Here he <hi>wonders that any Chriſtian can ſtill take me for a Saint, and the Guide of the Party; and recites ſome applauding words of Mr.</hi> John Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freys, (no Sectary.)

            <p>The reſt of his Invectives, to the end of his firſt Chapter, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a rabble of intimated, congeſted Lyes, upon the occaſion of the Wars, and perverted Words, unworthy of a Confutation. They are
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60957:44"/>
all built on the ſuppoſition that all that they did againſt the Parliament and Kingdom was not only juſt, but neceſſary; and all the Ignorance, Drunkenneſs, Ungodlineſs and Cainiſm of the vicious part of their Clergy were not to be blamed; but the reproof of them, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to reform them was heinous wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>What a Charm is the name of the <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Clergy, that can turn the moſt ſcandalous Treachery into Sanctity, and make the beſt Church in the World of the Haters of ferious Godlineſs, and make a deſire of their Reformation to be the badge of intolerable Rebels?</p>

I never met the King in the Field, nor ever ſaw an Army where he was, nor ever ſaw one of his Armies, till that of <hi>Goring</hi>'s at <hi>Langport</hi>-Fight, where the Field War ended. Indeed, I came into the Quarters where they had gone before me, and I was ſo guilty of oppoſing them, as to be aſhamed of the fame they left behind them.

But 'tis none of my purpoſe to intimate that they were all ſuch, or moſt.</p>
            <p>§ 86. Accuſ. LXIX. His next Accuſation is, [<hi>Our offering our Conſent to Archbiſhop</hi> Uſher'<hi>s Reduction of the Primitive Epiſcopacy, as a means of Concord.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Againſt this he ſaith, <hi>The Biſhops knew whence it came; not from the Archbiſhop, but from the Presbyterian Forge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Still this is English Church-Hiſtory: The Archbiſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to his death, as his Chaplains. Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> and Dr. <hi>Parre</hi> teſtifie: He owned it to me himſelf, and told me, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it at firſt, but after would have accepted it.</p>
            <p>But he exclaimeth againſt it, as that which would have pulled down the Biſhops, or cut their Throats. So that if one Biſhop may not be ſaid to govern many hundred Churches, when a Lay-Chancellor doth it, without any ſubordinate Biſhop or Presbyters, their Throats are cut. And even the two Agents of our Miſery, <hi>Sheldon</hi> and <hi>Morley;</hi> (who were intruſted by the King to word this Declaration,) are by this Man
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60957:45"/>
made their own Cut-throats, by granting ſome part of Paſtoral Power to the Rural Deans and Synods. This is the Church that muſt not be amended.</p>
            <p>He ſaith, that by this Model [<hi>They would have robbed the Biſhops of all their power, and taken it to themſelves.</hi>] And was Archbiſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> ſuch a Robber of himſelf, and all the Biſhops? Did he motion any thing but the Primitive Epiſcopacy, with the edditions of their large Dioceſs, Wealth and Honour? What was the power that they would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to themſelves? Was it to be Dioceſans, to rule a Dioceſs as the ſmalleſt Church that had none under it? Would each Man have had this Dioceſan Power, or only all, as one Political Body? If each Man, ſure <hi>England</hi> had not Dioceſſes enough for ſo many Thouſands: If all, as an Ariſtocracy, could they deſire more than Convocations have? Or did they deſire ſo much to all the Miniſters of a Dioceſs, in Conjunction with the Biſhop, as his Councils, as every ſingle Lay-Chancellor hath without the Biſhop? This is juſt like the Papiſts Accuſation of Pariſh-Paſtors, that <hi>every Man would be a Pope in his own Pariſh:</hi> And their ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Maſters that are for governing their Families, that <hi>every one would be a Pope to his own Houſe:</hi> And againſt Self-governing [of our Words and Actions.] that <hi>every one would be a Pope to himſelf:</hi> And Idiots per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not the Contradiction. To be a Pope is to be one that claimeth the Government of all the World, (or Church.) And is governing a Family, or my ſelf, governing all the World? And is governing a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Church under an Archbiſhop, the governing of many hundred Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes that are no Churches, but parts of a Dioceſan Church?</p>
            <p>I mentioned Mr. <hi>Stanley Gower</hi>'s words to me of Archbiſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> that he told him, that a Biſhop and Presbyter differed not <hi>Ordine,</hi> but <hi>Gradu;</hi> and that he took his Primacy and Lordſhip, not as his Church-Office, but as a Collateral Dignity given by the King:] (and one would think no Man that believes the Scripture ſhould think otherwiſe.)</p>
            <p>But this Accuſer ſaith, that <hi>he will not believe Mr.</hi> Stanley (as he calls him) <hi>or me:</hi> (But muſt we therefore both disbelieve our own Ears?) For <hi>he thinks the Biſhop ſhould then act againſt his Judgment and Conſcience.</hi> (What Act may that be?) And he citeth Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s Teſtimony, as againſt my Report; whereas the very cited words of Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſay the ſame, that <hi>a Biſhop hath Superiority in Degree above a Presbyter.</hi>] And the Accuſer putteth theſe words that are againſt himſelf in Capital Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it ſeemeth, not knowing what he did, or what <hi>Ordo</hi> and <hi>Gradus</hi> ſignifie.</p>

            <p>And he falſly ſaith, that <hi>I am a Diſſenter from Biſhop</hi> Uſher'<hi>s Judgment about the King's Tribute in</hi> Ireland. His Uuntruths come ſo thick, that I am weary of naming them.</p>
            <p>As, <hi>pag.</hi> 88. 1. That <hi>I was for the Extirpation of Epiſcopacy, Root and Branch.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>§ 88. Accuſ. LXXI. [<hi>I have heard it credibly reported by ſome Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Perſons there preſent that that Treaty might have had the deſired effect of Concord had not Mr.</hi> B. <hi>ſo obſtinately reſiſted.</hi>] <hi>Anſ.</hi> That is, either thoſe Reverend Perſons would have amended their Impoſitions, if I had not Petitioned them to do it, and told them the neceſſity of it; or elſe that all the reſt of the Commiſſioned Nonconformiſts would have Conformed to all the old faults which they proteſted that they judged ſinful, and to all the worſe that ſhould after be added, if I had not been againſt it. Theſe Reverend Perſons were as Credible and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend as you are; as our preſent ſtate in <hi>England</hi> tells us.</p>
            <p>Then he tells us what the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> told Mr. <hi>Walton</hi> (<hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s <hi>Steward</hi>) what Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi> ſaid againſt me,] which is half falſe: Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi> taking the Chair.

Why then did they <hi>conſent</hi> if they were <hi>unwilling?</hi> And if neither Reaſoning nor Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning them might be uſed, what were we Commiſſioned for? The truth is, many of our Brethren, when the Biſhops told them <hi>they would ſay nothing to us, till we brought in writing to them all the faults that we found with the Liturgy, and alſo all the Forms</hi> in terminis, <hi>which we deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as amendments or additions,</hi> did ſay, [It was not this, but an amicable conſulation that the King Commiſſioned us for; and ſeeing that this was a meer fraudulent pretence for our fruſtration, they motioned our departing, as being denied all that we were called to:] But I told them, that the Biſhops would report behind our Backs where we could not be heard, that we had nothing to ſay againſt their Impoſitions, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other terms to offer, (thinking we would never have agreed on any other.) Therefore I ſatisfied divers of them that though we were prejudged, it were better let the World ſee our Cauſe ſtated in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, than leave them to accuſe us ſo, when we ſhould never have leave to declare the truth, and deny their miſreports.</p>

            <p>§ 98. Accuſ. LXXXI. As to his Accuſation of the Book, I leave it to the Readers Judgment that will impartially peruſe it: But I am not yet convinced by him that it is a Crime to name the heinous ſins that have torn this poor Nation, and no Crime to commit them. Moſt of his Accuſations are that I tell them of their ſin, and perſwade them to repent.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. And muſt we go on ſuch ſuppoſitions that our Law-makers muſt not be ſaid to make ſinful Laws? Where and in what Ages doth this Principle hold?

            <p>If this Man think that we have not fully ſhamed that worſe than brutiſh conceit that we <hi>must not plead Conſcience against Mens Laws</hi> (though as good men as any Rulers we know) he ſhould have ſaid more to confute us, than that [<hi>we fear not God</hi>] becauſe we fear him more than man.</p>
            <p>This eaſie Diſputant confuteth my many Volumes of <hi>Reaſons</hi> againſt obeying their Impoſitions of Oaths, Subſcriptions, Profeſſions and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, by telling men that [<hi>I may be aſhamed to call them Reaſons.</hi>] A ſhort and cheap Confutation: Cannot the <hi>French</hi> ſay as much for Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooning the Proteſtants: And that [<hi>the Laws were made upon delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for our peace.</hi>] That is, for the peaceable ſucceſs of Silencers, and Perſecutors of Gods Faithful Servants: And were not the Six Articles in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's days made on <hi>deliberation?</hi> And the <hi>French</hi> Edicts againſt the Proteſtants?</p>

            <p>As to his talk, [<hi>That Men of Blood may be no Biſhops.</hi>] I anſwer, 1. I never drew a drop of Blood. 2. I refuſed their Biſhoprick. 3. I preach'd for the defence of Kings and the Nation againſt Men of Blood, Iriſh, Papiſts and Delinquents. 4. Were not the Military Clergy <hi>Men of Blood</hi> who complain of the Parliament for ejecting them, for promoting the War againſt them?

            <p>§ 102. Page 127. He nameth [<hi>The Act for Uniformity.</hi>] As if naming it were a Defence of it for Silencing 2000 Miniſters for not Lying and Sinning.</p>

            <p>He nameth the [<hi>Declaration that it is not lawful on any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,</hi> (to take Arms againſt any Commiſſioned by the King.)

The Words limit the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the Biſhop only to that <hi>which is not contrary to any thing in the Book;</hi> and I am very tractable in ſuch a Caſe: But it is none of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that I am concerned in. 2. If it were in the Biſhop's power to put what Senſe he pleaſe on all the Words, he were the Law maker; for the Senſe is the Law. 3. I have gone to divers Biſhops, and asked their Senſe, and found it as unſatisfactory as the Book it ſelf. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, I asked the Biſhops at the <hi>Savoy</hi>-Debate, [<hi>If I have two in my Pariſh that declare they believe not in Chriſt,</hi> but are Deiſts; and yet will ſend their Child to be baptized, with Godfathers and Godmothers of their own Fraternity, who declare that, whatever they ſay, they never mean to own or educate the Child,] what Right that Child hath both to Baptiſm, and certain Salvation? And Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> (in the Chair) anſwered That as long as he brought ſuch Godfathers as the Church of <hi>England</hi> requireth, I muſt not doubt of his Right. I long after asked Biſhop <hi>Cunning, What proof he had from God's Word, of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, undoubted Salvation of all ſuch baptized Infants, if the Parents were Heathens or Jews, or Atheiſts, and reſolved to educate their own Children?</hi> And he anſwered, that <hi>As any one had Right to take up an expoſed Child in the Street, and take him in Charity into his Houſe, ſo any one had power, as an Act of Charity, to take up any Heathen's or Infidel's Child, and being him to Baptiſm; and then it was certain (by the Word of God) that he was in a preſent State of Salvation.</hi> Theſe Biſhops Judgments are not that undoubted Word of God which they boaſt of, but will not ſhew us. And other Biſhops think otherwiſe. And ſo under ſeveral Biſhops, we muſt be of ſeveral Religions.</p>
            <p>§ 112. Accuſ. XCIV. He accuſeth me for ſpeaking of the Tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mr. <hi>R. Hooker</hi>'s Argumentation, (when their Biſhop <hi>Sam. Parler</hi> ſpeaketh much more) and the Caſe is undeniable.) And that I ſay, [<hi>If</hi> Hooker, Bilſon <hi>and</hi> Uſher <hi>were alive, they would be Nonconformiſes.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:60957:50"/>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Have I not fully proved it? They were honeſt Men, and would not ſubſcribe and practiſe contrary to their own Writings; but their Writings are downright againſt much of Conformity. How large is <hi>Hooker</hi> for the <hi>Popular Legiſlative Power;</hi> and that <hi>the King uſeth not Power, but Uſurpation, when he uſeth more than the Law giveth him?</hi> How large is biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> for <hi>Reſiſting the King in divers Caſes?</hi> Doth not Conformity renounce and forſwear this? Mark the renowned <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> in this: Honeſt Men would not go againſt their Judgments.</p>
            <p>§ 113. Accuſ. XCV. Pag. 134, 135. He maketh it my ſhameful heinous Sin, to beg of the Biſhops not to be guilty of one of the moſt heinous Sins in the World, <hi>even the Silencing faithful Miniſters cauſleſly, and famiſhing many Thouſand Souls, and laying them in Goals that have Charity to relieve them.</hi> Saith he, [<hi>Doth not the Reader bluſh for Mr.</hi> B. <hi>to read ſuch arrogant Cenſures of a dying Man, concerning his Betters?</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Were I not a dying Man, the World might more powerfully have tempted me to be like you; and to call Evil Good, and Good Evil; and to regard as little the Intereſt of Souls, and of ſerious God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. And are my <hi>Betters</hi> better than he that bid us pray the Lord of the Harveſt to ſend forth more Labourers; and that ſaid of ſuch as offend one of his Little Ones, it had been better for them that a Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone had been hanged about their Necks, and they caſt into the Sea? Were they better than he that told <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> that they knew not what manner of Spirit they were of, when they ſhewed their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inclination to that Prelacy which is now your Glory? 1. By deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be greateſt, and to ſit at his Right Hand and Left. 2. By ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing a Man that uſed Chriſt's Name againſt Devils, becauſe he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed not <hi>with them.</hi> 3. By deſiring a fiery Puniſhment upon thoſe that received not Chriſt and them.</p>
            <p>Are my Betters better than <hi>Peter</hi> and the Apoſtles, that were for obeying God before Men? Or than <hi>Paul,</hi> that charged <hi>Timothy</hi> ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as before God and Chriſt, to preach the Word, and be inſtant, in Seaſon, and out of Seaſon? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Are my Betters ſo good at Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimy, that they can transform the moſt heinous Crimes into ſacred Vertues, and the greateſt Duties into odious Sins?</p>
            <p>Reader; Oh, Who governeth that part of the World, where the greater the Sin is, the more heinous is his Crime that blameth it? And where <hi>Repentance,</hi> and Perſuading Men to repent, goeth for the moſt intolerable Evil? Were it not that fleſhly and worldly Intereſt were againſt it, I ſhould fear that at laſt Murderers, Thieves, Traytors, Adulterers, Perjured, and all ſuch, ſhould accuſe all thoſe that either accuſe them, or diſſent from them; and demand againſt them the ſame Puniſhment for calling them faulty, that their own Crimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve? But though thoſe that have died in Goals for Preaching (no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60957:50"/>
but the Goſpel) are out of the reach of theſe that would kill them again, if they did but ſay, <hi>You killed us;</hi> yet One that is better than theſe perſecuting <hi>Betters,</hi> will ſay, <hi>In as much as you did it to one of theſe, you did it to me.</hi> And to accuſe us as the Prieſts and Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces did the Apoſtles, [<hi>You would bring this Man's Blood in us,</hi>] will not transferr the Guilt or Puniſhment, from the Blood-guilty, to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover.</p>
            <p>§ 114. Accuſ. XCVI. Becauſe I ſay that ancient Chriſtians diſobeyed lawful Magiſtrates, in Preaching and Worſhip, he ſaith, [<hi>As if Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrates were to be reputed as Heathen Perſecuters.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I. And indeed, Were (not only <hi>Conſtantius</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo) <hi>Theodoſius</hi> II. <hi>Arcadius, Zeno, Baſiliſcus, Anaſtaſius,</hi> and many ſuch, Heathen Perſecutors? And did not the Biſhops of <hi>Alexandria, Antioch, Jeruſalem, Rome, Conſtantinople,</hi> and many hundred other Biſhops, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey them, and many by Arms reſiſt them? And is it not as bad to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Chriſtian Emperors, as Heathens? I think it was not well done.</p>
            <p>What Hiſtorical Proof can convince this ſort of Men?</p>
            <p>2. But ſee what their Obedience amounteth to. <hi>Who is to be Judge</hi> whether their Rulers be ſo bad, as that the Biſhops and People may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey them? Muſt the Rulers themſelves be Judges, or every Subject for himſelf? They dare not anſwer it without Fraud and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>But he ſaith, [<hi>If one read the Preamble to the late Acts, you may ſee that the Cauſe of making them, was not only the late dreadful Experience that the Nation had of the Confuſions cauſed by the preaching of ſuch Men, but their preſent Endeavours to reduce us to the like again</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. He doth not tell you how fully I have anſwered this, in the Apology which he accuſeth. And every Boy and Woman cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him.</p>
            <p>2. Who is to be Judge who the Preachers were that cauſed our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions? The old Parliament ſaid, it was ſuch as <hi>Laud, Sibth<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rp, Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waring,</hi> and thoſe that drew the King from his Parliament. If I knew this Man to be wiſer or greater than the Parliament, I might prefer his Judgment, and prefer the Hundreds caſt out for Scandal, before thoſe that are impriſoned for preaching.</p>
            <p>3. Why would they never grant our frequent Petitions, to ſilence only thoſe that never medled with War, or had no Accuſation againſt them for any ſuch Confuſions, and ſpare not thoſe that had been guilty? Were all the Thouſands guilty of the Wars, that were Children or School-boys?</p>
            <p>4. Why were not the Eight Thouſand that after conformed, guilty of thoſe Confuſions as much as the reſt? Yea, many of them had been in Arms againſt the King's Army.</p>
            <p>5. Was <hi>Declaring Aſſent and Conſent to all things contained and preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in</hi> your Books a Means to prevent Wars or Confuſions, when ſuch
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60957:51"/>
Impoſitions cauſed them? Is ſilencing, ruining, and keeping in Goals all that own not ſo much of your Infallibility, the Means to avoid Confuſions?</p>
            <p>6. What were <hi>the preſent Endeavours to reduce you to the like?</hi> Was it the Presbyterians bringing home the King, who they doubted not would ſet up the revengeful Clergy? Why were they not accuſed for falſe or ſeditious Doctrine, if they were guilty, or forbidden only to preach ſuch, but forbidden to preach at all, and accuſed meerly for preaching?</p>
            <p>His long Invective, to <hi>pag.</hi> 148. is partly a falſe Report of my Words, and partly a Juſtification of all their Perſecutions, and an Outcry againſt a Perſuaſive to Repentance. Let the Reader but peruſe the Books ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, and I deſire him but to judge as he ſeeth cauſe.</p>
            <p>§ 115. Accuſ. XCVII. If the Reader will himſelf read my Treatiſe of Epiſcopacy, which he accuſeth, I will make no other Defence of it than what it maketh for it ſelf. But his Words convince me not, that Reproving Perſecutors is worſe than Perſecuting.</p>
            <p>§ 116. Accuſ XCVIII. He maketh it <hi>my Pride to print Mr.</hi> Glanvile'<hi>s Letter to me,</hi> though I diſowned harſhly his exceſſive Praiſe,) while Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> had called me to it, by printing Foreigners Letters againſt us. And I muſt be yet more proud, for telling Biſhop <hi>Morley</hi> and <hi>Gunning,</hi> that I offered them <hi>a Way if Chriſtian Concord, more ſure and harmleſs than that which they had tried, becauſe it was more divine, being only to unite in what Chriſt hath inſtituted.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is no pride to ſay, that Chriſt is greater and wiſer than thoſe Biſhops; and that to unite in his own inſtituted Terms of Union, is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer than the Terms of their Canons, or Act of Uniformity. Is it pride in all the Proteſtants, that to the Papiſts prefer Scripture-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to their Canons.</p>
            <p>§ 117. Accuſ. XCIX. He falſly alledgeth <hi>the reaſon of my unſatisfied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with Dr.</hi> Stillingfleet'<hi>s Conceſſions.</hi> One of the chief was, that he would have Parents diſabled to chuſe Schools and Tutors for their own Children. But whether ſuch Men as this were not far more againſt Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Conceſſions than I was, let my old Friend, Mr. <hi>Samuel Thomas,</hi> now of <hi>Chard,</hi> his <hi>Invective againſt Dr.</hi> Whitby <hi>and Dr.</hi> Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet, be Judge; and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> himſelf, who ſeemed once to yield to Terms of Concord, which many of us offered to him and others. And judge of the peaceableneſs of that Tribe of Clergy-men, by the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi>'s burning Dr. <hi>Whitby,</hi> a Conformiſt's excellent Book, called <hi>The Reconciler,</hi> and his being forced to ſeem to retract it.</p>
            <p>§ 118. Accuſ. C. His Intimations, <hi>pag.</hi> 156. of my deſiring to be <hi>a Pariſh Biſhop, and alſo motioned with Dr.</hi> Owen <hi>to be an Archbiſhop,</hi> are meerly impudent: When I never was either Pariſh-Biſhop, or ſought it at leaſt, ſince caſt out of the Miniſtry, 1662. nor ſo much as the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60957:51"/>
Paſtor of any Church, and have refuſed a Dioceſan Biſhoprick many Years before any one now in <hi>England</hi> was a Biſhop. How can a Man be n nocent before ſuch impudent Accuſers and Judges?</p>
            <p>§ 119. Accuſ. CI. As to his Accuſation of <hi>my Self-Contradictions, and</hi> L'Eſtrange'<hi>s Proof,</hi> I think no diſtinguiſhing Reader will need a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of ſo falſe a Charge, which confuſed Heads do feign, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not things that differ.</p>
            <p>And for his Charge againſt my <hi>Third Plea for Peace,</hi> about <hi>the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Government,</hi> I only refer the Reader to the Book.</p>
            <p>§ 120. I have not thought his mere general Clamours worthy of a particular Anſwer, leſt I tire the Reader, as I have tired my ſelf with ſo unſavoury an Employment. But I will here tell the Reader, how I that theſe eight Years have never thought this Accuſer worthy of an Anſwer, have been brought to change my Judgment and to be at this unpleaſing Labour, when other Thoughts are more ſuitable to my Condition.</p>
            <p>I. A Letter from ſome ancient Conformiſt, that calls himſelf <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus De Minimis,</hi> (of my Age, Seventy five,) ſo earneſtly calleth me to Repentance and Retractation before I dye, referring me to this Book for the notice of my Sins, that I thought not meet to reſiſt his Importunity.</p>
            <p>II. I read ſo much of the horrid Reports of many Papiſts, of the Crimes and Deaths of <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Calvin, Bucer, Phagius, Beza,</hi> and many ſuch, and how confidently they are commonly believed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and how greatly it hardeneth many againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, that I was loth to contribute to their Deceit.</p>
            <p>And I find that the ſame Sect accuſeth the Generality of Diſſenters, that do but affirm that <hi>there is AND THING</hi> in their Books of Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy or Articles, or in their Ceremonies or Ordination, or in their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deans, Archdeacons, <hi>AND THE REST that bear Office therein,</hi> unlawful or repugnant to the Word of God,) who are my Accuſers, and cry, as <hi>Morley, Ex uno diſce omnes;</hi> and when they have render'd me as one of the worſt on Earth, they make the reſt as bad; when I take them to be (for the moſt) the beſt Miniſtry that I ever knew. And no wonder that their Writers and Preachers thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, when their Canons <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excommunicate them (unheard,) not excepting Lords, Knights, Miniſters, or any. And Lying is now grown ſo common a Sin in <hi>England,</hi> (confeſſed by all,) that few know what Reports to believe, or to reject: So that to betray my own Cauſe to theſe Accuſers and Canoneers, is to betray the Innocency of many Thouſands.</p>
            <p>III. I have long thought it my duty to call this ſinful, divided, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tearing, bleeding Nation to Repentance, in a Treatiſe called, <hi>REPENT O</hi> ENGLAND, (<hi>Bradford</hi>'s dying Words,) though Experience telleth me, that ſuch Men as this will take the Motion for a greater Crime, than all the Sins that I call them to repent of; ſo odious a thing is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60957:52"/>
and Confeſſion to the Proud and Impenitent. And before I call others to Repentance, (ſeveral ſorts,) I take it for my firſt Duty to exerciſe my own: To which end, I unfeignedly reſolved to confeſs what I could by any means find to be my Sin; and being referred to this <hi>Accuſer</hi> for my Conviction, I found the Falſhoods and Calumnies ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſo groſs, that I took it for my Duty not to ſeem by Silence to give Credit to them; but having confeſſed what Sins I found, to do my part to ſave others from the Temptations to Hatred, and Lying, and Perſecution, which ſuch Men lay before them.</p>
            <p>IV. And having laboured moſt of Forty two Years, by Writing to profit Poſterity, as well as the preſent Age; and written above a hundred and twenty Books to that End, and God having proſpered them far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my expectation, (in <hi>Germany,</hi> and other Foreign Lands, as well as in <hi>Britain,</hi>) I thought it Treachery to ſuffer the Devil and his Agents to blaſt them all, (with thoſe that know me not,) without any Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Confutation of the Slanderers. Sure if they were worth ſo many Years Labour, 'tis worth a little to take them out of the Fire or Water where Diaboliſm caſteth them: Which I am the more moved to, becauſe while I have the Thanks of Thouſands that have read them, common Fame, and Mr. <hi>Cantianus,</hi> that called me to this Work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and others, do tell me, that the Generality now known by the Name of <hi>Tories</hi> (or malignant Haters of ſerious Piety) in <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially among the Univerſities and Clergy, do ſo much hate my Name, that they will read no Book which they ſee my Name prefixed to, (unleſs as the Adverſary againſt whom it is written.) And as I have ſmall hope of curing that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Prejudice, (which is more the hurt of the Envious than of me,) ſo I muſt not by Sloth or Silence contribute to its Increſe, and Men's Guilt.</p>
            <p>§ 121. I will conclude with theſe three farther Notices to all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, for the true underſtanding of all theſe Controverſies with the Men who ſo implacably hate and accuſe me.</p>
            <p>I. That they groſly cheat their ſequacious Believers with this great Lye, that <hi>I am againſt Biſhops;</hi> whereas I am for a Divine Right of three ſorts of Biſhops, (two by direct Inſtitution, and the other by Conſequence,) <hi>viz.</hi> I. General Biſhops, (call them Archbiſhops, or Dioceſans, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicks, or Evangeliſts,) that in every Nation are over many Churches.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Epiſcopi Gregis,</hi> or Ruling Paſtors of ſingle Churches, which are all true Presbyters.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>Epiſcopi Praeſides,</hi> or <hi>Pro-eſtotes,</hi> which are the Preſidents of the Presbyters in particular Churches. And that I am of the Judgment of <hi>Grotius, De Imperio ſummarum poteſtatum circa ſacra,</hi> and highly value Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Overall</hi>'s Convocation-Book in the main, but abhor all <hi>Foreign Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,</hi> yet deſiring the moſt extenſive <hi>Foreign Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 122. II. That they groſly cheat their Believers, in telling them that I am againſt <hi>Forms and Liturgies,</hi> when they know that we offered to uſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60957:52"/>
theirs, upon the Amendment of ſome Faults, and ſevere cruel Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and by their Demand were put to draw up Additional Forms, which we did in the very Words of Scripture: And though ſome called it <hi>The Reformed Liturgy,</hi> becauſe it ſeemeth an entire Frame, yet it is falſely ſaid, that <hi>we would have that or none;</hi>] for we only offered it to the <hi>Biſhop's Examination,</hi> which they would never do: And even this Accuſer hath nothing that I find againſt it, but that I confeſs <hi>it was ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily drawn up in eight Days, and therefore muſt needs be imperfect, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a Review.</hi> And ſo it is our Crime, that we take not their three Books to be all ſuch Effects of Infallibility, as to have no one Fault con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God's Word; and yet to confeſs our own (though in the Words of Scripture) to be the Work of defectible, imperfect Men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needing a perfecting Review. <hi>Humility,</hi> and not <hi>Subſcribing</hi> to an <hi>Arrogant</hi> Claim of their Indefectibility, is our great Crime.</p>
            <p>§ 123. III. They yet more dangerouſly deceive their Believers, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading them, <q>That we appropriate <hi>Godlineſs</hi> and <hi>ſerious Religion</hi> to our <hi>Extemporate Praying,</hi> and to the Oppoſition to Biſhops, Liturgy, and Conformity; and that we falſely diſhonour their Church, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting their Candidates and Clergy to be more unable Preachers, or more ungodly Livers, than the Nonconforming Miniſters and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates; and their Pariſh-Flocks to be more <hi>unqualified</hi> for Church-Communion, and a more irregular Church, than ſuch as we have deſired in our Motions for Reforming-Concord: <hi>Whereas</hi> (ſay they) <hi>we have the beſt Clergy and Church in all the World.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I ſay, 1. That we have largely enough, in <hi>Folio,</hi> oft told the World what it is we account and call <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> even the <hi>making</hi> and <hi>keeping</hi> the <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant; Believing, willing</hi> and <hi>living</hi> according to the <hi>Creed, Lord's Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Law of Chriſt.</hi> We offered them a Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; we owned all that was good in theirs: We know that Prayers from a Book, as from a Habit, are accepted, if they come from a penitent, believing and obedient Soul; and that the Prayers of ungodly Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are unacceptable to God, whether with a Book, or without.</p>
            <p>2. And we love and honour Conformable Miniſters and People that are Chriſtians indeed, and ſhew it by ſerious practice of Chriſtianity: And we are very thankful to God, that <hi>England</hi> hath had ſo many ſuch, that were conformable long ago; and we doubt not, hath many ſuch yet, even under the new (and much worſe) Conformity. We know not that Nation that hath more excellent Men than many of the Biſhops were in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time, and than many Divines ſince have been; ſuch as <hi>Robert Bolton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Preſion,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sibs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Scudder,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wheatley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dyke,</hi> Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> Mr. <hi>Downham,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stoughton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> Dr <hi>Willet,</hi> Dr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> Archbiſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Downam,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Beadle, &amp;c.</hi> Oh, how many of ſuch excellent Men hath this Land been bleſſed with! (And the pious Nonconformiſts
<pb facs="tcp:60957:53"/>
were of the ſame Spirit, though not in all things of the ſame Opinions.</p>
            <p>I have lately told you in a ſmall Book, called <hi>CAN and ABEL,</hi> what are the things that make the difference, which hath my chief Regard. But ſuch Conformiſts as I have named have, ſince <hi>Laud</hi>'s <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ays, with many gone under the name of <hi>Conformable Puritans,</hi> and by this Accuſer are reproached by the Name of [<hi>Paſſive Conformiſts,</hi>] becauſe they had rather the Ceremonies and needleſs Subſcriptions were forborn, than able, faithful Preachers ſilenced.</p>
            <p>The Prejudice that he ſaith I had from my Youth againſt the Biſhops and Clergy, was only againſt <hi>Ungodlineſs</hi> and <hi>Malignity.</hi> Is it like that I was againſt the <hi>pious Conformiſts,</hi> when I was tutored by them, heard them, and was of their Judgment?</p>
            <p>But can we not, even among <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> diſtinguiſh the <hi>Malicious, Ungodly, Worldly,</hi> from <hi>holy Men of Love and Peace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 124. If Poſterity and Strangers muſt be deluded by ſuch falſe Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians as this, that tell them the ſerious Godly Miniſters and People were Schiſmaticks and Rogues, and the Haters of ſerious Religion were the moſt Religious, who can help it? They talk ſo now to thoſe that live among both Parties. And the debauched, ſenſual Youth, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous and ambitious Worldlings, ſeem (partly) to believe them: But ſo do not the ſober Sort, that daily ſee the Confutation of their Malice.</p>
            <p>§ 125.

Here and there there was a civil Perſon by Temper and Education; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, not a ſerious Word could I hear from their Mouths about God, or our Redeemer, and the Spirit's ſanctifying Works; or of Death and Judgment, and the Life to come, (ſave in the Pulpit;) nor did they love to hear any ſuch from others, but their Talk and whole Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was about the World, or common worldly Things, and (as Mr. <hi>Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> largely deſcribeth them) any Godly ſerious Diſcourſe did but diſguſt them, and marr their Mirth, and make them revile the Speakers as Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaus, Hypocrites, or ſome ſuch Names.

Or truſt that Phyſician that cureth none? I thank God that I have found more of the Effects of his Saving Grace than the ordinary ſort, and Members of the deſcribed Church-Party, which theſe Men extol, did ever ſhew me.</p>
