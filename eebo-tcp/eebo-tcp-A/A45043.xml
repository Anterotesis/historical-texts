            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

by some,
that in such
a restles age of <hi>printing</hi> a
man should <hi>decline</hi> that,
which so many <hi>Court</hi>
and <hi>Idolise,</hi> the reputa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
of an <hi>Authour,</hi> and
be hardly induced to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
his works to come into
the World by another
hand. It must needs be
a <hi>great</hi> minde that can
<pb facs="tcp:59103:6"/>
contemn <hi>great</hi> things.
But that I should be so
much concerned in the
publishing of this, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but give thee an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
Going about the
beginning of 1649. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Seas, I left
some three, or four of
these <hi>Paradoxes</hi> imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
yet such was the
estimation the Authour
had gotten by former
things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and such the
<hi>avarice</hi> of the plodding
<hi>Stationer,</hi> that he would
needs fasten on them as
they were, but with a
slight promise from the
other to <hi>divertise</hi> so far
<pb facs="tcp:59103:6"/>
as to bring them into
some considerable bulk.
Upon these hopes, some
moneths after my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
what I left was
committed to the <hi>press,</hi>
but as for any <hi>advance</hi>
(by reason of the War in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> whither the
Authoor was designed in
order to some <hi>publick</hi>
transactions, as also his
<hi>relation</hi> to the <hi>State,</hi>
besides the <hi>burthen</hi> of his
<hi>profession,</hi> not easily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
such <hi>diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)</hi>
there was so little
done, that returning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>England</hi> towards the
latter end of 1651. I
<pb facs="tcp:59103:7"/>
found so much <hi>printed,</hi>
as I had left behinde me
in <hi>writing.</hi> But under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that there was a
considerable <hi>impression</hi>
of them, and that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle
why they came not
abroad, was, besides the
<hi>imperfection,</hi> the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the <hi>bulk,</hi> I have
for thy satisfaction, been
so importunate with the
<hi>Authour,</hi> as that he hath
<hi>built</hi> up those <hi>foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
to what thou findest.
The <hi>superstructure</hi> I
must confess is not much
but if it be considered
that without it thou hadst
had nothing, I may say
<pb facs="tcp:59103:7"/>
it is <hi>all.</hi> Nor mayest thou
justly quarrel, that the
satisfaction is but slender
in regard of the <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi>
of almost three
years, that this book
hath been printing, hadst
thou received nothing
but that of the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of <hi>Women,</hi> a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scovery,
which haply,
were it put in execution
might bring us to a
greater <hi>settledness</hi> and
<hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
in regard that
<hi>Women,</hi> where they
once come to <hi>govern,</hi> do
it <hi>perpetually,</hi> and had
rather want <hi>life</hi> then
<pb facs="tcp:59103:8"/>
               <hi>domination.</hi> This is all
I have to say to thee,
unless it be to tell thee
that my interest with
the <hi>Authour</hi> may haply
prevail with him, to do
that <hi>violence</hi> to his <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
as to furnish thee
with some other things
of better consequence,
though certainly we
meet with an <hi>age</hi> which
hath so little inclination
for any thing of <hi>worth,</hi>
that were it not for some
particular <hi>persons</hi> left
like things gathered
from a <hi>shipwrack, we</hi>
might <hi>despair</hi> of <hi>inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,</hi>
or at least <hi>that</hi>

            </p>
            <p>If we conceive that
most correspondent to
the law of nature,
which most Nations do
agree in (though in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent)
and that we see
upon all the <hi>Globe</hi> very
<hi>few</hi> and <hi>little</hi> Republicks,
but <hi>many</hi> and <hi>vast</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
we may deduce
from thence, that most
people, do desire to be
under the sway of <hi>one,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59103:15"/>
who if he be not indued
with a <hi>supreame</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited</hi>

their <hi>servant</hi> then their

to thinke that
so <hi>great</hi> a part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
would be content
to obey their <hi>slaves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor doth it proceed
from <hi>cowardize:</hi> for we
see the old and modern
<hi>Persians,</hi> the stoutest
<hi>Septentrionall Nations,</hi>
the <hi>Turks, Scithians,</hi> and
<hi>Muscovites</hi> at this day,
pride themselves so
much in this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that they adore
their Emperors as gods;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59103:15"/>
Nor doth it proceed
from <hi>Stupidity,</hi> for the
<hi>wisest</hi> and <hi>politest</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have imbraced it,
and though some politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
have termed it but
the <hi>privation</hi> or <hi>disease</hi>

many more, have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
it the only best

unanimously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
must bee obeyed
without resistance;
Now they <hi>assume,</hi> that
Royalty is the only go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
that God
hath ordained, and is
pleased with (Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>ectypes</hi> of him and
bearing his name) and
therefore they ought to
be obeyed <hi>without resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi>
and none ought
to <hi>lift their hands</hi> against
them. Now if none
ought to bee the least
disobedient, and that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59103:16"/>
               <hi>Rebellion is as the sin of

who they say are not to

should be for the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of some unjust co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
which if Subjects
might actually disobey
&amp; cal to account, all the
world would bee filled
with <hi>confusion</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</hi>
But say they,
<hi>Kings</hi> are <hi>onely answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God</hi> whose <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents</hi>
they are, and
not subordinate to any

above all law, which

evinc'd, whatsoever
they doe is lawfull and
not examinable.</p>
            <p>Besides, what more
contrary to the <hi>ease</hi> and
<hi>order</hi> of the people, then
the <hi>multiplicity</hi> of Laws,
<hi>litigious</hi> interpretations
of them, and <hi>obstreperous</hi>
Lawyers? but all this
is cut off, and saved,
when the <hi>fountaine of
Law</hi> is in one breast, and
the people may present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know the resolution
and interpretation from
one that <hi>cannot doe
wrong.</hi> For all Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the King, and hee
by <hi>maxime</hi> not capable
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59103:17"/>
of doing any wrong,
whatever he doth must
be just and right; and
what greater happinesse
to a people, then grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them <hi>speedy</hi> justice.</p>
            <p>The <hi>proportion</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Now the <hi>greatest</hi>
soules aime at nothing
so much as at <hi>rule,</hi> and
at no rule in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of that over men.
Now if <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

be <hi>truly</hi> rewarded with
any thing that is <hi>evill;</hi>
and Nature never tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59103:18"/>
it must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that superiority
seems to bee set as a

would not disdaine to
governe, where hee is
<hi>pounded</hi> up with servile
restrictions, and limited
by those who were
borne to obey him.
<hi>Caesar</hi> chose rather to be

Now for the <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
of a State, what
better way to it then
<hi>peace,</hi> and what better
way of preservation of
peace, then by having
continually ready ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
force, which may
quel every insurrection,
and <hi>stifle</hi> it in the birth,
and yet serve for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>magnificence</hi> and
<hi>attendance</hi> upon the
Prince? what better
<hi>plentation</hi> of wealth,
then to have a Court
<hi>entertained</hi> with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
and <hi>glittering</hi> in

as it were <hi>triumphing</hi> in

<hi>curiosities</hi> of Art? and
yet this without Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Courts is vainely
expected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rome</hi> had never known
<hi>Nero's golden house,</hi> had
it not beene for <hi>Nero;</hi>
nor the great <hi>Arch,</hi>
had <hi>Trajan</hi> never lived;
nor had <hi>Spaine</hi> ever
dreamt of an <hi>Esicuriall,</hi> if
he had wanted a <hi>Philip.</hi>
And yet things are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
their chiefest and
lasting glories. Besides
what better way to
keepe a Kingdome <hi>quiet</hi>
then by employing the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59103:19"/>
poorer sort of people,
upon such workes as
the Prince shall either
fancy or delight in?
Thus we see the <hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids</hi>
at this day remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
the fame of the
place whereon they
stand. And we read of
the <hi>Hortipensiles</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon,</hi>
&amp;c. none of which
had ever beene done or
knowne, had not the
care and noble wisdome

the people that way,
who else might have

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:59103:20"/>
Besides, all the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the Politicians
could never shape out
but three kindes of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<hi>Democracie,</hi>
which is nothing but
<hi>dregs</hi> and <hi>confusion,</hi> and
an <hi>audacious</hi> licence to do
every thing; &amp; indeed an
<hi>interstice</hi> of government,
rather then government.
<hi>Aristocracy,</hi> when onely
the nobles have the reign
in their hands, and are so
apt to <hi>burst</hi> into factions,
that it could not <hi>thrive</hi>
nor <hi>prosper</hi> any where.
<hi>Aristotle</hi> indeed in his
<hi>Politicks</hi> mentions some
few <hi>obscure</hi> ones, and we
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59103:20"/>
know but one extant at
this day. And <hi>Monarchy</hi>
which is the only perfect
<hi>system</hi> of government,
which indeed includes <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy</hi>
within it self; for a
Prince must have Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours,
who if they
were Guardians to him,
and might <hi>impose</hi> their
advice, what a <hi>repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
inconsistent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi>
thing were a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
to himselfe. But
if the last judgement
of every thing be to be
left to him, and no man
can so absolutely rule
his <hi>understanding,</hi> but
that it must bee
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59103:21"/>
somewhat sway'd and
byass'd by his will,
it will follow, that it is
necessary to the very
<hi>essence</hi> of a Prince, to
have his own wil <hi>free</hi> &amp;
<hi>uncontrolable,</hi> and then
what a poore thing
is a Prince, if he be not
obeyed.</p>
            <p>Besides, since all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
do <hi>ascend</hi> and
<hi>dissolve</hi> into universals,
there must among so
many private fathers, be
one publicke Father, to
be the great <hi>Archetype</hi>
of all the rest. And if
private fathers have
such intire authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59103:21"/>
their sonnes; (Nay
which the Romans and
some wise Nations had
power of life and death
over their children) it
is but equitable, that
publicke Fathers should
have <hi>Analogicall</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over those who
stand bound to them in
that relation.</p>
            <p>You will say, they
may be <hi>vicious</hi> persons.
But their vices are only
as <hi>private</hi> men, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
render them in their
publick capacity either
lesse <hi>just</hi> or lesse <hi>skilfull.</hi>
Besides they stand open
to the <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>envy</hi> of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59103:22"/>
all men, and so every
little slip of theirs may
be observ'd and blaz'd,
which if they had beene
private persons, had
been as obscure as <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.</hi>
Or put the case
their vices be high and
big, they seldome want
superiour vertues to
<hi>cloud</hi> and <hi>shadow</hi> them.
For every thing being in
<hi>great</hi> and <hi>high</hi> soules, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive,</hi>
it is impossible
for them to keep a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity</hi>
in their vices,
which are commonly
<hi>illustriously great,</hi> and
rather matter of <hi>obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
then <hi>hate</hi> or
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59103:22"/>
               <hi>scorne:</hi> for the <hi>Grandeza</hi>
and <hi>Gayety</hi> of them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts
them from those
poore ridiculous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
which fall on
the slips of more meane
and sordid natures.</p>
            <p>And you will say,
they may be <hi>ravenous:</hi>
great <hi>fires</hi> must have
great store of <hi>sewell;</hi>
great <hi>magnificences</hi> that
cannot stoop to <hi>thrift,</hi>
must <hi>stray</hi> to <hi>gaine,</hi> and
who should better
supply the <hi>head</hi> with
<hi>spirits,</hi> then the <hi>lower</hi>
parts of the same body?
Besides the publicke
losse is nothing all this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59103:23"/>
while, for it is in the
<hi>same</hi> Country, onely
gathered into <hi>one</hi> hand,
and <hi>gloriously</hi> spent,
whereas otherwise it
might have been insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
<hi>misled</hi> away in <hi>ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
&amp; Princes what they
<hi>draw up</hi> from their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in <hi>Vapours,</hi> they
<hi>returne</hi> down to them in
<hi>showers</hi> and <hi>inrich</hi> and <hi>fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>
the places where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they reside.</p>
            <p>And in case they
sometimes fall <hi>heavy</hi> on
private persons, 'tis but
<hi>exercising</hi> that <hi>severity</hi>
which the law provides
against <hi>vice,</hi> and then
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59103:23"/>
tis worke of excellent
<hi>justice,</hi> Or if happily the
parties be <hi>innocent</hi> and
<hi>blamelesse,</hi> we should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
him but a <hi>bad</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
that would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
a <hi>publick Burden,</hi>
with his own privat suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
&amp; cheerfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
up his estate when
the Commonwealth,
should either <hi>gaine</hi> or
<hi>save</hi> so much by it:</p>
            <p>But then you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
they are <hi>Usurpers,</hi>
no man envies <hi>reward</hi>
to <hi>danger,</hi> and what
greater danger, then
for a <hi>man</hi> with all his
<hi>relations</hi> and <hi>interests,</hi> to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59103:24"/>
encounter a present
power, which if they
overthrow, 'tis fit they
should injoy the <hi>fruits</hi>
of it. And then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
by this meanes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages
them to a great
<hi>warinesse,</hi> and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>flatteries</hi> and <hi>obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of the people, which
otherwise they would
have <hi>neglected.</hi> And
they must also walke
<hi>providently,</hi> least they
leave <hi>holes</hi> for others to
<hi>creep</hi> in at upon them,
as they did upon their
Predecessors, Withall
it hath beene knowne
that a many Princes
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59103:24"/>
have <hi>sweetned</hi> and <hi>disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>
the memory of their
<hi>accesse</hi> to Government,
by making many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>lawes</hi> and <hi>provisions</hi>
in their severall Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
which <hi>heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
and <hi>successive</hi> Princes
(confident of their <hi>titles</hi>

to doe the <hi>contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You will say further,
that the rayes of <hi>these</hi>

none so <hi>eminently</hi> evill
as <hi>Flatterers</hi> and <hi>favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.</hi>
But I pray you
will you not give peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that do <hi>great</hi> things
leave to injoy the <hi>poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
reward, the <hi>relation</hi>
and <hi>report</hi> of them? Or
in case they did <hi>nothing</hi>
memorable, would you
not allow them that
<hi>groane</hi> under the burden
of publicke affaires, so
<hi>small</hi> a diversion and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
as flattery?
which indeed soberly
considered, is so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to <hi>allay</hi> the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of life, that the most
<hi>unfortunate</hi> men, whey
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59103:25"/>
they want others to do
it to them, do it for
themselves, and <hi>pleasantly
chase</hi> away all <hi>ugly</hi>
thoughts and <hi>Idea's</hi> by
their happie feeding
themselves with a few
<hi>lovely</hi> dreames.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Favorites,</hi> will
you deny them the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
to make choice
of their own <hi>Privadoes?</hi>
or if you suffer them to
make choice, will you
<hi>strangle</hi> their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
denying a <hi>mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi>
interchange, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
of Courta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies?
Or will you bee

so <hi>injurious</hi> to good

what more powerfull

then the <hi>aim</hi> and <hi>design</hi>
of the particular <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
and <hi>endearments</hi> of

            <p>THere is no one
question which
hath so violently
tortured the Moralists,
or variously divided
them then that of a
cheifest good, which
yet, they could never
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59103:27"/>
yet so determine, but
that it lyes open to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
objections, &amp; begets
new doubts: they might
(methinks) with more
ease have considered
the variety of mens
complections, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
the search of an
universall happinesse,
have affirmed that the
<hi>Summum bonum,</hi> was only
that which the particular
fancy and humor of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man would bee
pleased to make it, for
so long as their tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature
clime education,
custome and interests
are so different, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59103:28"/>
to bring them
to a conformity.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding
what they had resolved
on this, had been but
the production of a
new falsity, if there
had been a wanting of
stupidity and drowzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in men, and that
<hi>Fictum impossibile</hi> of
content had never been
imagined.</p>
            <p>For if wee consider
the severall ends that
men propose to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
and finde most of
them either irrationall
and imperfect, or else
unsuitable to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59103:28"/>
we shall finde a
great deale of reason to
pittie mankind that
distracts it selfe with
so many monstrous and
untoward thoughts,
and many times bends al
his endeavors to obtain
that which he should
be affraid to injoy, and
many times with a
great deal of sweat and
industrious madnesse,
devises and labours
his owne ruine, so that
there cannot be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
plague to him, nor
can fate more compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
punish him then by
resigning him over to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59103:29"/>
the injoyment of his
own wishes.</p>
            <p>And put the case hee
should injoy them, since
he is so stupid that hee
cannot wish any thing
truly good, he did
but please himselfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his burden, and de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceive
his understanding
with glittering misery,
and then what better
were he then some jovial
madde man, who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
himselfe to be
some great Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst
his fetters and
straw, but in case hee
misse and should sit
downe without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59103:29"/>
is not that man
miserable, who is fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
of his best and

forc'd cowardly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
the contrary
wants; what other is
this, but as if he could
not dance a galliard,
should swallow downe
opium, and thinke to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay

stupification.</p>
            <p>And put the case that
some few men arrive at
any of these dul compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences,
which most do
so studiously court, what
one condition wants its
sting and venome:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59103:30"/>
wealth cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t make a man
invulnerable, jealousie
doth ever; honour can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make a man secure,
yet it raises up a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of enemies: fame
can neither render a
man more strong or
wise, yet it is easily bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
and when once it
declines brings double
ignomy; health may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a man active, and
save a groane or two,
yet at such a state it
may arrive that it may
prove a sicknesse; or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it never so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
one poore steelet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

it: now what one

with either of
these when 'tis infected
with such bitter ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients,
whom easily spoil
all the rest of delight,
which is onely imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
whilst they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
but we love to toyl
for uncertainties, and in
this are worse then
children, who sport in
raising of bubbles and
such toyes, but we are
earnest in things more
rediculous.</p>
            <p>But wee'l, suppose
that any of these foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
could bee enjoy'd
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59103:31"/>
without their inherent
evills, yet surely a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of all sublunary
things, might now and
then suggest a possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of surviving them,
and then what more
hideous misery then to
have beene fortunate;
and since death must
either surprize all men,
or overcome all men;
and his stroake is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
as unevitable;
what man can fully
please himselfe with
that which hee is not
certaine to enjoy a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:59103:31"/>
But suppose a man
were intirely possest of
a happinesse, such a one
as were perfect in it self,
and he might perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
injoy without the
least feare of losse. If it
were but single, and
such a one as runnes in
one continued current,
time would make it
burdensome, &amp; repititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
loathsome; for that
eternity is but durance,
that is not diverted
by change; and those
pleasures but tortures,
that are not varied by
sweet jealousies, or sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
by eclipses.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59103:32"/>
Who would not rather
choose the racke at
length, then perpetuall
repose upon a bed of
roses? What taste would
not be soone weary of
the sweetest delicaties?
Among all the terrours
of men, death is the
sharpest; of all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
life the strongest:
Yet we see <hi>Tython</hi> after
he had obtained a petty
immortality, grew wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of himselfe, and after
a great many wishes,
was very glad to shrinke
into a Grashopper: nay,
and for this very cause,
doth an old Criticke
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59103:32"/>
quarrell with <hi>Homer,</hi> for
making his gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
when they are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the passions of
men, and but masters
of determinate plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
            <p>But suppose this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
were chequered
with variety, and that
there would be evernew
entertainment, and new
diversions, this were
not content, but rather
a transportation: And
how can we say the soul
is satisfied, when she is
ever labouring of new
desires, and ever stroak'd
with fresh entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59103:33"/>
which if ever
they come to repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
grow much more
wearisome, and much
more gall and spurne
her. Thus have we seen
many persons great and
glorious in their several
ages, tyr'd with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality
of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and willing to fall
backe even to solitude
and ease. Thus did
<hi>Lucullus</hi> surfeit on Asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aticke
victories, and
providently retire to a
strange and unheard of
luxury: And yet <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesian</hi>
afterwards ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the same course,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59103:33"/>
was presently wearied
of that silence and secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
which he imagined
would have been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to him, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to returne again
to businesse. Whence
we may deduce, that as
the most capacious souls
are the most eager in
their delights, so are
they the least satisfied
with them, and have
the most violent appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
of change; and
what is this but to hate
content, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a tame slavery
under the tyranny of
one condition?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:59103:34"/>
Nay, were it possible,
that variety could bee
endlesse and infinite, yet
this variety would bee
so troublesome that a
man would naturally
grudge, and cry on an
inordinate fluxe and
change, and blesse those
lives as happiest, that
regularly over-acted the
same things, and spent
every minute according
to rule and prescript.
And certainly hee that
killed himselfe, out of a
wearinesse of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
the same things,
would also have dyed
on the contrary termes,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59103:34"/>
if his life had been waf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in a perpetuall va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riety.</p>
            <p>And if wee looke
somewhat more nicely
into the thing it selfe,
we shall finde that the
sluggish Name of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
never came from
any other forge then
the dull multitude (who
though they be masters
of words, are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enemies of reason,
and therefore ought to
bee accounted one of
those <hi>Grotesco</hi> Maximes,
and <hi>willy-with-wishes,</hi>
that doe so disfigure and
misguide the life of
man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:59103:35"/>
For alacke, what is
it? hath it not a sound
of restraint and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance?
and doth it not
rather imply a lethargy,
then any actuall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime?
Joy it doth not
amount unto, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a heavy privation
of joy. It signifies rest,
and imperfect acquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence;
but joy is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by perpetuall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and tickl'd with
change of pastimes,
and may bee content
though not happy; but
joyfulnesse immediately
includes happinesse:
Now what a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59103:35"/>
condition is that,
wherein a man must be
patient without either?
and how can that man
not be weary of himself
that wants that sweet
charme, that bewitches
mans life into all that
is lovely, Joy? And if
he wants joy, he wants
happinesse; and if his
unhappinesse be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with ignorance,
is he not I pray, wrapt
up in a double misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune?
Since the plague
of ignorance is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
that can fall upon
men, the badge of our
forefathers sinne and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59103:36"/>
our slavery; and that
very weight which sinks
us downe from our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
constitution, into
the cernuous lownesse
of beasts.</p>
            <p>Besides, content is a
meere mortification and
eradication of the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
those excellent
wings and engines of
the soule; but joy doth
both enliven and heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
them, she both stirs
them up and tutors
them, whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mangles and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
them. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
joy is like an itch,
which spreads further
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59103:36"/>
by that delightful mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of rubbing and
chasing: content meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mortifies the minde,
and so brings in a gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green,
and a gangreen is
followed with no mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
attendants, then
cutting and burning.</p>
            <p>But suppose you mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
happinesse content,
yet were there not such
a thing in nature. For
as <hi>Boetius</hi> hath demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
there is but one
great happines, and that
made up of a compleat
variety of those things
whose shadowes wee so
much adore; and that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59103:37"/>
no man can be happy
till he be made in some
measure a Deity. And
how farre wee poore
pismires that crawle
upon this hill, are
from it, let any body
judge. Some Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
indeed, drunke
with their prosperity,
have and still assume
this Title, yet they dye
like men. Nay and in
the very height of this
vanity are ashamed of
their parasites, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sute
all these portentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
attributes, by the
stings and whispers of
their owne thoughts.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59103:37"/>
Nor indeed if we should
feigne a reality in such a
conceit, is the soule ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of receiving it.
For as she hath a kinde
of a circumscribed ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
within herselfe, so
hath she a limited, as I
may say, immensity:
And therefore is rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
and extravagant in
her appetitions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
and like the heaven
from whence shee first
came, is carried on in
a perpetuall motion,
which <hi>Content</hi> indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to stop, doth
but in a manner stifle,
and by consequence
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59103:38"/>
annihilate her. Besides,
shee being a thing of
such a strange capacity
and wide comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it is impossible that
any determinate narrow
thing, much lesse, some
fragment or fraction of
it, should be suppos'd of
a proportion to fill her.</p>
            <p>Since it is thus, it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
followes what an
unworthy thing it is in
man to set up his rest
upon any of these toyes,
and to dote upon one
particular shadow in a
broken mirrour, where
hee cannot see that
face which would
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59103:38"/>
have irradiated one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
image in the whole;
for since all pleasures
here are but petty fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillations,
and parcells
of the whole, and
therefore have lost of
its nature, like Christall
beaten to peeces, being
Opake, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
would have beene
Diaphanous; tis but a
folly to looke after
them, since we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
finde them all, or if
we would, cannot unite
them: I must conclude,
that man must like a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
bee perpetually
rowled on his owne
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59103:39"/>
               <hi>Axis,</hi> and as much as
lyes in him avoid, to be

by divesting of them
of all that the Taylor

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59103:39"/>
much as to deprive them

of most of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
or at least the
most noble and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
part of it, youth,
which are the onely
judges in this case. As
for those things which
they call old men, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
against them, as a
generation of decrepit
and wither'd understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
a people whose
mindes, could they bee
looked into, would
prove infinitly more
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59103:40"/>
monstrous then their
bodies, and such as like
old Monkies, having
either gnaw'd away, or
lost their tayles, read
lectures to young ones
to cut theirs too.</p>
            <p>But I positively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that what was
done in the primitive
times, when our reason
was not deprav'd with
long traditionall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,
nor tinctured
by any prevalescent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
is most conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and consequently
ought most to bee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.
But <hi>Adam</hi> and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59103:40"/>
               <hi>Eve</hi> wee know was so
farre from being cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed,
that it was the
great marke of their
liberty and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and the first brand
that stigmatized them
after their fall. Nor
indeed did the ages that
presently succeeded
that, either grow up
into garbe or fashion,
but continued with a
very little variation,
and possibly what their
progenitors did only
with Figge-leaves, they
supplied with Kid-skin
aprons.</p>
            <p>Yea, and those Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59103:41"/>
who have not
alienated their naked
simplicity, either by
commerce, or busie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
doe as yet
retaine this open in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie,
and declines
not into these unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
sophistications of
Garments; as was
observed in many of
the <hi>Indians</hi> at the first
discovery, who living
meerly among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and by their own
peculiar customes, it is
to be supposed retained
most among them, of
that which nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
to be kept pure and
unvaried.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:59103:41"/>
Not to say, that all
men naturally desire to
goe uncovered, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it is a shrewd
suspition of it, that
when the sun returnes
to this side our Horizon,
they know no better
way to congratulate
the presence of that
fruitfull light, then
by putting on thin or
open cloathes, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
bathings, which
is no other: but, since
that Tyrant custome
prohibits them absolute
nakednesse, they would
approach it as neare as
they can, and surely
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59103:42"/>
it must either bee hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
or excellent du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that they strive to
performe it upon that
occasion.</p>
            <p>But in women, these
desires are farre more
intense, for they wee
see, doe at all times un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the part of their
cheifest Beautie, as
their face, neck, breasts
and hands, so that they
doe indeavour in part
to breake that restraint
which hides the rest of
their glory, and to set
sorth their delicat Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
plaited and weaved
with such varietie,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59103:42"/>
their Ivorie necks, their
harmonious faces, their
milkie spherical breasts;
and their melting hands.
And though possibly
jealousie may cause all
these to be hid, yet 'tis
but violation: and the
weather, yet that is
but providence, or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
company, yet that
is but compliance, for
what woman is there,
the beast exempted from
deformitie, that could
not wish that all her
garments were of Lawn
and transparent, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then rich and gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous.
For if, as <hi>Plato</hi>

saies, soules unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

be a curious mansion,
which so fine a substance
as the soule is in love
with, and then I pray
you can you blame the

and what a torment is
delight if it be shut up
in one breast, and not
defused into a lively
communication, for all
kind of blessings mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
by their devision,
and what greater bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
then a rare sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry

into love.</p>
            <p>We give to all the
Vertues the habits
and visages of women,
and of all the vertues
Truth is the best (for
Truth is the mother of
Justice, and Justice they
say, comprehends them
all) yet shee is naked,
though shee love the
publicke and hate cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and is it not very
fit that all the sex
should imitate such an
excellent patterne and
mistresse?</p>
            <p>It may be objected,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59103:44"/>
that this would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
infinite provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and incitements to
lust: but I say not; for
I dare say, that what by
painting, what by the
loosenesse and change
of garments, what by
these gaudy inventions
of dressings, that flex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure
and fracture of
gate, the deformity is
hidden, unlesse to a
very nice eye, there is
much more fuell added,
then if all went with no
more mantles then Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
thrust them into
the world with; Haire
hanging loosely downe,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59103:44"/>
or else carelesly gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up in a fillet, and
perhaps some little kind
of cover, that might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine
the Virgin all
flower, from being too
much gaz'd at, and
blowne upon. Nay,
this experience will
tell us, for <hi>Lerius</hi> avows,
that in his voyage to
<hi>Brazill,</hi> affirmes he had
fewer insurrections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
that naked simple
people, then he had had
among the curiosities
and adulterated beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of his owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
For indeed if wee
consider it aright, there
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59103:45"/>
is nothing that doth so
much puffe up lust, as
the circumstances of
rich apparrell, curious
dressings, and strong
perfumes, which scrue
up the apprehension,
and fix the imagination
upon somewhat that is
great. So that by this
means, we know a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of great persons
zealously courted to
have their appetites sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied;
whereas if they
were either left naked,
or reduced to a vulgar
garbe, they might lye
fallow, or be endited for
Witches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:59103:45"/>
But indeed nakednesse
restores women to
themselves; for what
an irregular height
doth <hi>Venetian Chippins</hi>
mount them to? What
Towers doe the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish
Tires weare upon
their womens heads?
How are the <hi>Grecians</hi>
buried in cloaths? How
doe the dressings of all
Nations disguise them?
that they must put off
their Masquine habits,
or bee taken to peeces
like watches ere they
can bee enjoy'd; and to
what other end, I pray,
were they made? The
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59103:46"/>
customes of Countries
are different, and that
garbe is majesticke at
one place, which is redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
or sordid in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
All people have
not the same concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of beauty; which is
as hatefull to an Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian
as blacke to us:
But once uncloathe
women, and they are all
the same; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
about the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and measures of
a body differ not. And
what greater right can
wee doe to women, then
to bring them to bee
judged by one rule?
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59103:46"/>
And since every wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
judges herselfe the
fairest, she that would
be backward to this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitriment,
would be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of herselfe, and
consequently a Renna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade
from her sexe. The
three goddesses in <hi>Ida</hi>
design'd to bee stripp'd
to the view, &amp; the single
examination of a shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd;
and <hi>Comines</hi> will
tell you, that shee was
a Princesse that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in a Lawne smocke
to bee viewed by Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours,
as towards a
marriage, said shee
would put off that too,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59103:47"/>
if there were any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity:
For as there is
an inextinguishable jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
and emulation
among women, so there
is an unmeasurable
pride; and pride arising
out of confidence will
never decline judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
way of judgement,
then those rules, which
the voyces of all men
conclude upon? for a
woman may paint a
green or yellow cheeke
as easily as a red; but the
sweet composure and
measure of her body,
her thighs, breast or
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59103:47"/>
visage, limbs, she cannot
alter. And how imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
are they to be seen
through cloathes, which
may hide and falsifie
many things, which may
truly be discerned in a
veracious nakednesse.</p>
            <p>There have two
great blemishes ever
laine upon this sex; the
uncertainty and change
of their judgements, and
their inconstancy in their
cloathes and carriage.
And how can either bee
better removed, then if
they were once reduced
into such a posture as
they should all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59103:48"/>
agree in, and they
had not liberty to
change? And I pray
what other way is
there, unlesse you make
them all naked.</p>
            <p>But then they may
complaine, that take
away their Arts and
their Ornaments, they
shall want of their
complacency, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
to their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.
But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
they have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
enough left them,
they may <hi>Dye,</hi> or
pounce, or figure their
flesh, they may have
abundance of cheap ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59103:48"/>
ornament from
shels, feathers, and
stones; and since the
deeds of our Ancestors
are left us for example,
the old <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
may be imitated in
this, for dying and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying:
And since it is
fit to borrow the
customes of other
people, if they bee use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and fit to bee
assum'd, there may bee
seen choice of dressings
enough in the one, and
the other <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, since the
Sunne, the Moone, and
all the glorious battalia

of heaven, appeare as
Nature made them,
since the strongest and
most handsome Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malls
are satisfied in

not, since the most
delicate and <hi>Aromatick</hi>
flowers are not ashamed
of their barkes or
prickles, which are
commonly unsightly, if
not offensive. Tis but
an irregular and morbid
desire in women, who
are the Master-peeces
of Nature, and of that
sort of her productions,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59103:49"/>
wherein shee is most
vain-glorious, and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

of Art, which
are so farre beneath

For if we say there is
such a thing as danger

fear, or mis-information,
yet possibly the danger
may never touch us:
If we consider it in the

               <hi>Danger</hi> but <hi>misery.</hi> And
if we consider it in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

and this falls under
none of them, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
that this hath
no time at all, which
being inseparable to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

it will be evident, that
<hi>Danger</hi> is a meer <hi>Non-entity,</hi>

            <p>In the comparison of

for <hi>Dangers,</hi> supposing

since all wise men agree

dare affront <hi>dangers</hi> are
therein tried, and move
at that time in their
naturall motion, and
to its own proper moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every thing hath an
appetency, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must necessarily
delight in it. And can
there be a greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to a man then for
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59103:55"/>
so smal a trifleas his own
heart should inable him
to conquer a monster or
a multitude. This the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
<hi>Ovid</hi> knew wel
enough, and therefore
after he had compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
armed <hi>Cadmus,</hi> hee
sayes hee had a minde
—<hi>Telo praestantior omni.</hi>
For indeed such minds,
are like gold purified by
the fire of <hi>dangers,</hi> and
exalted up to their due
perfection. And if <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
doe so cheerfully,
even in her vegitative
things imbrace every
advantage, may we not
think that rational souls
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59103:55"/>
have these desires so
much the more strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
by how much their
<hi>Natures</hi> are the more
noble.</p>
            <p>For the passive part
of fortitude, tis so far
from being a Traytor
to the happinesse of
man, that it inebriates
the minde in all calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and makes them
lushious; nay restorative
unto her. Now this
without <hi>danger</hi> could
not bee, for jealousie
ever attends upon mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and there is none
holds fast one linke of it
but he may justly feare
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59103:56"/>
for to catch another.
What greater misery
then poverty which
threatens by flying from
us, and is a negative e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy?
yet <hi>Baucis</hi> and
<hi>Philemon</hi> by induring of
it.</p>
            <q>Effecere levem—</q>
            <p>And since what is not
burdensome to us but
light, must needs please
us, and that a man is
never himself but when
he exercises his head or
his heart, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>dangers</hi> he could not
do, it is evinc'd, that
wee are beholding to
them, as the spritefull
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59103:56"/>
spurres, and dear enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
of the life of
man.</p>
            <p>Moreover, man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in nothing so
much as in fame, and
how can he bee more
glorious then by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a serenity, nay glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
amidst so many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
as <hi>dangers</hi> are?
Or what can be more
delightfull to him, then
to see he is so much his
own master, that he can
defie all casualties, and
either carelesly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
them, or expect
them with confidence.</p>
            <p>What more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59103:57"/>
to whole Armies,
nay even insulting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors,
then <hi>securitie?</hi>
what better means to
frighten away securities
then <hi>dangers?</hi> which
must needs be of a very
soveraigne vertue, that
are a means to preserve
whole Armies, and of a
most diffusive fruitful <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
that when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
least they are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test.</p>
            <p>Besides, rewards are
proportioned unto <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;</hi>
which shewes
them of a worthy, and
deserving <hi>nature,</hi> and
therefore many men
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59103:57"/>
have beene called the
saviours of their <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
at one time, for some
little performances,
which if they had done
at another, would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have beene noted,
and hence it is that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great stratagema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
wits, have no better
ways either of startleing
their <hi>enemies,</hi> or retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their <hi>friends,</hi> then by
increasing the shew of
their <hi>dangers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what other
means, if <hi>Tyrants</hi> had to
possesse themselves of
<hi>Guards,</hi> to bring the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
into commiserati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59103:58"/>
then by this onely
pretence, which neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
shewes how pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
and popular <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi>
are, and what atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
they require
(which shewes their
majesty) that they
whom they once threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
must immediately be
secured, for what else
are guards but honorable
imprisonment?</p>
            <p>But if the shaddow,
and meer representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>dangers,</hi> what is
the substance and <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi>
themselves, when a
<hi>man's</hi> in <hi>safety</hi> few regard
him, many may envy
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59103:58"/>
him: but falling once
into <hi>danger,</hi> tears, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration,
releife, and
that possible from his <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,</hi>
which is the
sweetest of al, come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him.</p>
            <p>Since we have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested,
the rare use and
necessity of <hi>dangers,</hi> it
will not be hard for us
now; to shew them of
that <hi>Gallant Cordial</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that they closely
accompany the best
things, and immediately
flow from our most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
<hi>happinesses,</hi> from
which they are no more
separable then heate
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59103:59"/>
from light.</p>
            <p>And are not I pray
you the best things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in the greatest <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
Purselain</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
Glasses are the most
apt to be broke, the
richest flowers are the
soonest <hi>pulled,</hi> the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
Stag, wil be soonest
<hi>shot,</hi> the best Faces doe
the soonest <hi>decay,</hi> the
best men are most lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to <hi>envy,</hi> the richest
to <hi>spoile,</hi> or indeed, what
better in all the world,
then that divine stone
of the <hi>Chymists,</hi> yet men
in the atchieving of it,
doe commonly hazzard
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59103:59"/>
both their braines and
subsistance, and in case
they come neer an end,
it is a very good escape
if their <hi>glasses</hi> bee not
melted or broken, or
evill spirits, as <hi>Flamell</hi>
admonishes, doe not
through <hi>envy</hi> blinde
their eyes, and spoile all
the <hi>worke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But indeed to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the thing aright, <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi>
are so incorporated
and mingled with the
best courses of life, that
like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> twinnes
they both live and dye
together.</p>
            <p>What more fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59103:60"/>
then to be the favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of a <hi>Prince,</hi> yet the
thrones of <hi>Princes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are not placed
on <hi>Cubes,</hi> nor are those
<hi>Cubes</hi> founded on <hi>Rocks,</hi>
or cemented with brass;
there is a sword hangs
by a horse haire perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
o're their heads,
and they may dye by
the cornel of the grape,
by a <hi>haire,</hi> by a pricke,
as wel as other men, and
then wher's the <hi>Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi>
does not he hold by
a poor Tenure, that has
no more assurance? and
can he promise himselfe
continuance in case of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59103:60"/>
the change of the Lord:
or suppose the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his <hi>Master</hi> were
constant and durant,
how shall he be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
of his affection?
or be free from that
secret undermining of
that vast faction and
a dangerous precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in his fall? and
yet notwithstanding all
this, who would not
chuse, nay, wish to be
the <hi>Privado</hi> of a <hi>Prince?</hi>
so that it was but <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillanimously</hi>
said of him
who was of an opinion,
that if a Crown were
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59103:61"/>
lying on the ground,
and men knew with
what thorns it was lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they would hardly
take it up.</p>
            <p>For if we will consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the principal cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of life, which men
imagine to themselves
will be the most <hi>pleasant</hi>
and fullest of <hi>delight,</hi>
we shall finde them at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with depending
<hi>inconveniences</hi> and <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi>
What greater piece
of allurement then the
company and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of <hi>women</hi> and yet
this for the most part
brings on <hi>venereal</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59103:61"/>
which are the most
nasty, dangerous, and
worse to be rooted out
of any whatsoever?
What life seems more
royal and magnificent
then to be perpetually
<hi>feasting?</hi> And yet this
brings on <hi>surfets, gouts,</hi>
and other diseases that
make a man miserable
even to his grave. What
greater or more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
way to profit
then <hi>Marchandise,</hi> which
notwithstanding is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hour subject to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
that a mans life
and substance being
committed to winde
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59103:62"/>
and water, two of the
most uncertain things
in the world, are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
but two or
three inches from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
            <p>Since we have been
so far in <hi>danger,</hi> it were
a sin not to be in <hi>debt,</hi>
since <hi>debt</hi> and <hi>danger,</hi>
accompany on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and me thinks if
a man would but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
these great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
which men
in this condition have,
he must needs say there
is somewhat in it, much
more pleasant than the
vulgar imagine, who
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59103:62"/>
though they think it an
estate, wherein there is
nothing but misery and
the uttermost calamity
of fortune, yet is it
quite otherwise: For
first, a man having past
the <hi>Meridian</hi> of his
fortune, sets and rests
without noise, he is not
entangled with <hi>depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies,</hi>
needs neither
to care for <hi>publick</hi> bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
or <hi>miseries,</hi> but is
wholly withdrawn into
himself. Besides what
nobler duty is there
of mankinde, than to
give every man his own,
and this he is perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59103:63"/>
sollicited to, nor
does he want his daily
<hi>attendance</hi> and <hi>visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
which the greatest
<hi>Favourites</hi> in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of their fortunes
miss; nor can he ever
be unprovided for, since
at the utmost, he is sure
of <hi>lodging</hi> and good
<hi>company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will amount to
this, that since dangers
are not onely <hi>unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
but even <hi>consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi>
to the greatest <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi>
it were a madness
to avoid the one for
fear of the other. And
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59103:63"/>
certainly <hi>Damocles</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little understood the
value of a royal enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
when for fear
of the sword hanging
at a horse hair over his
head, he could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
himself out of that
noble feast that was
set before him.</p>

Was it that they
knowing such a supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority

too cruel and

thought it in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

Or else (according to

it as inconsider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able?
Certain it is that

            </p>
            <p>That this is a <hi>truth,</hi>

that looking

pardon it in respect of

therefore if great <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>

            <p>But a <hi>Martiall-man,</hi>
you will say, is a <hi>savage</hi>
bruitish thing, a thing
that knows how to run

them, one whose

               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:59103:70"/>
triffles. But when a
man tells you, that even
the <hi>wisest</hi> men, have
been strange doters on
this sexe, and absolutely
given up to them, it will
change the case. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
there is no man
thinks <hi>Solomon</hi> a <hi>fool,</hi>
and it is well known,
how these <hi>white Devils</hi>
seduc'd him. <hi>Augustus,</hi>
that was certainly one
of the <hi>steadiest</hi> men in
the world, one that in
his <hi>youth</hi> out-witted the
<hi>hoary senate,</hi> was all his
life time led by one
<hi>Livia,</hi> who had that
great <hi>prevalescence</hi> with
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59103:71"/>
him, that he by her
means disposed the
succession of the <hi>Empire</hi>
upon a son of her womb
by a former husband,
though he had nearer
kindred of his own.
But to make this yet
plainer, age we say be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
wisdom, now how
general the affection of
old Men is to Women
needs no proof, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the older they
grow, some of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score,
marrying Girles
of sixteen, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is a clear Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the truth of
this point, and of the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59103:71"/>
wisdom of those reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
<hi>seniours</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
accordingly.</p>
            <p>Besides, as certainly
there wants not its rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> that
all <hi>vertues</hi> are of this
we plead for; so we may,
in the perusal of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
finde as many fair
and brave examples of
virtue given by <hi>women</hi>
as there hath been by
<hi>men.</hi> Look over the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oul of them, and yee
may easily fill each of
them into a sufficient
common place, where
many things put
down as nobly done
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59103:72"/>
by men, it may be are
either <hi>bruitish, heady,</hi> or
<hi>passionate,</hi> whilest in
the woman things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
more smooth and
temperate. Or if there
be any thing of <hi>passion</hi>
or <hi>exorbitancy,</hi> it is but
an addition of <hi>lustre</hi> to
their sex, as a blush, or
glowing in the face sets
off their beauty.</p>
            <p>Now if it be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that <hi>governours</hi>
should be of good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
<hi>affable,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
of <hi>countenance,</hi> and
such as seem to harbour
no crooked or dark de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
no men, can be
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59103:72"/>
so fit for Government
as women are. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
their natural <hi>sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>innocency,</hi> their
talk, is commonly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to such things
as it may easily be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
that their heads
are not troubled about
making of <hi>Wars,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
of <hi>Empires,</hi> or
founding of <hi>Tyrannies.</hi>
So if we consider both
what hath been said,
and that even those at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
which are to be
most wish'd for in a
Governour are in them
we shall clearly gain
what we desire: What
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59103:73"/>
greater happiness to a
people than to have a
Governour that's <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious?</hi>
Now all <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi>
and <hi>Experience</hi>
teaches us, that the sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
mindes are most
capable of these <hi>impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
and that women
are for the most part
more violently <hi>hurried</hi>
away by such agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
than men are. How
few men-<hi>Prophets</hi> do
histories afford us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparison
to <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesses;</hi>
and even at this
day, who such absolute
followers of the <hi>Priests</hi>
as the <hi>women</hi> are? If
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59103:73"/>
you wish them <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi>
these are the <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest</hi>
things on the
earth; They have <hi>tears</hi>
at command, and if
<hi>tears</hi> be the effect of
<hi>Pitty</hi> and <hi>compassion,</hi>
and <hi>pitty</hi> and <hi>compassion</hi>
be the mother of <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi>
must we not think
that mercy rules most
in them, and is the soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
expected from them?
If you wish <hi>affection</hi>
to the <hi>Country;</hi> where
can you better have it?
Have not the women
many times cut of their
<hi>Hairs,</hi> to make <hi>Ropes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
for <hi>Engines</hi> and <hi>Strings</hi>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:59103:74"/>
for <hi>Bowes?</hi> Have they
not given up all their
<hi>Rings</hi> and <hi>Jewels</hi> to
defray <hi>charges?</hi> Have
they not been <hi>content</hi>
to perish with their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
in their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and what greater
love of country can be
shewn? And how great
would this be, if a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
lookes upon her self
as the <hi>mother</hi> of her
<hi>Country?</hi> What ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
would she not
have towards the <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
her <hi>children?</hi>
When you see private
women sometimes shew
such extraordinary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59103:74"/>
thereof, that it
comes near <hi>dotage</hi> or
<hi>madness.</hi> Or would you
have affection to the
people at home? No
effect so violent, as that
of women: murthers,
banishments, proditions
have been but small
matters thence arisen,
and what <hi>Tragical</hi> ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
their <hi>despairs</hi> have
brought, <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances</hi>
will abundantly
shew.</p>
            <p>Thus were this noble
sex restor'd to that right
which nature hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on it, we should
have all <hi>Quiet</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:59103:75"/>
in <hi>common-wealths-Courts</hi>
would not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up with <hi>factions</hi> and
<hi>underminings,</hi> but all
would flow into <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
and <hi>liberty.</hi> Instead
of molding of <hi>Armies,</hi>
we should be preparing
of <hi>masks,</hi> and instead of
depressing of <hi>Factions,</hi>
we should have <hi>balls</hi> &amp;
<hi>amorous</hi> appointments.
So that <hi>men</hi> might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
their <hi>handycrafts,
oxen</hi> might <hi>Plow, Mill-horses</hi>
drive about the
<hi>Wheele,</hi> whilest all this
labour, &amp; sweat should
serve but for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and easiness of the
<hi>Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:59103:75"/>
Then also should we
have no <hi>Wars,</hi> which
<hi>Slectingius</hi> and <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
argue so much, and
the <hi>people</hi> pray so much
against. For women, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>tender</hi> conditions,
and most part of <hi>seden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi>
lives, would not
engage in such rough
employments, proper
onely for man, who is
onely the best kinde of
savage, over whom they
have also this <hi>prive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
that they can
<hi>bring forth</hi> the greatest
<hi>conquerours,</hi> but man can
onely <hi>destroy</hi> them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for several emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59103:76"/>
have they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their <hi>active</hi> valour,
whereof they want not
their several Instances.
Nay, some nations have
unanimously grown up
into it, as the <hi>Amazons</hi>
of old, and I believe,
were it not for the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation
of men at this

seen someting modern
very like them, and Sir
<hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not have been at the

            </p>
            <p>Withall we know,
how necessary it is in
every <hi>States-man</hi> to be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59103:76"/>
master of all the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices</hi>
and <hi>slights</hi> that
may be to gain upon
them he deals with.
Now if any can be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for this than wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
I am much decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
For what by their
<hi>importunities, glances,

artifices,</hi> and little <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>delities,</hi>
it is as impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to escape them,

            </p>
            <p>Suppositos cineri doloso.</p>
            <p>But I see a <hi>volly</hi> of

You will say they will
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59103:77"/>
be <hi>inconstant,</hi> fitter they
for all occasions of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.
They can turn
and <hi>tack about</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the <hi>winde</hi> serves,
and so will never <hi>ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack,</hi>
whereas many
Princes have split them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
by being too <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate</hi>
in one course.
You'l say they will be
<hi>proud.</hi> But what more
proper than <hi>Majesty</hi> and
<hi>high</hi> deportment in a
<hi>Governour;</hi> without <hi>pride</hi>
how should there be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
how should
there be <hi>subjection?</hi> You
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59103:77"/>
will say they will be too
<hi>delicate</hi> and <hi>gay.</hi> This
is but to keep the <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginations</hi>
of the people
<hi>aloof,</hi> which must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
be <hi>heightened</hi> by
such curious <hi>deceptions,</hi>
which are as needfull
for them, as the <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na

are <hi>talkative.</hi> So much
the better for the <hi>people,</hi>
whereas <hi>dark</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
<hi>Princes,</hi> that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mean nothing or
ambiguously leave the
people in suspence, and
make liberty either
dangerous, or flattery
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59103:78"/>
misconstrue it. You'l
say they'l be cruel? I
would fain know what
<hi>King,</hi> take the wisest
or the best, ever bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gl'd
much if a head or
two were in his way.
And therefore why
should we condemn
them for what is so usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
practised. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
you will say they are
<hi>unwise.</hi> But I pray you
how many <hi>sotts,</hi> and <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals,</hi>
and <hi>changelings</hi>
by virtue of <hi>successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
have mounted the
Throne? Things it may
be of <hi>obstinate</hi> natures to
boot, whereas women,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59103:78"/>
cannot be worse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

worst: and withall are
more easie and supple
to be guided by wise
<hi>Counsellours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We must therefore
<hi>conclude,</hi> that as women
<hi>bring forth</hi> children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world, as they
<hi>multiply</hi> themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these <hi>visible</hi> and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall</hi>
souls, and after
they have brought them
forth, are most tender
and carefull to <hi>bring</hi>
them <hi>up;</hi> So it is most
fitting, having all these
<hi>preheminences</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences</hi>
of <hi>nature,</hi> that
when they were brought
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59103:79"/>
up, they should also
have the <hi>Government</hi>
of them. For a Potter

by its first thoughts
whereas if it truly des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended

easily found, that many

many such things as

            <p>To go no farther for

seems the one to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew'd,
and how much

other: whereas if they
were both stripp'd into
a naked consideration,
there is nothing but
trouble, and a kinde of
servitude in the one,
and repose and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escence
in the other.
For if man were to be
valued by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
or frequency of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59103:81"/>
his motions, a <hi>spaniel</hi>

disfranchis'd of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain
and outward di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances,

even with the body
(for certainly its very

I mean of such imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections

to exercise those noble
functions that her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
leads her to. For
to run upon a common

(which by this means,
must be strangely

not onely unnecessary,
so may it be objected,
that the freest and most

unconcern'd in any

superiour Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
they must needs

thus quietly &amp; serenely
to be his own prisoner,
then with a great deal

carry shackles about

            </p>
            <p>We may add to this
that <hi>going</hi> in man, seems
to be one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

which were curs'd

that it is no less
wonder and delight to

Nor is it much to be
urg'd, that nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences
this some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59103:84"/>
in others by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary

for not to say, that such

in a manner useless, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
made indeed for
matches than service:
who was ever yet heard
of that could outrun
a <hi>Hart</hi> or a <hi>Barbary,</hi> or
to make equal journies
with a <hi>Dromedary?</hi>
And if it should be
suppos'd that they were
able to do so, that were

Besides we are to

For as there are but

it, so it proceeds for the

hurts, or loss of <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
which must needs
be from a mans par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
valour, or else
receav'd in the defence
of his <hi>Countrey.</hi> If it
be the former, what

can be imagin'd
than to loose part of
what we brought into

we owe all we have, or
to speak a little more
pressingly, to all the
<hi>interests</hi> both of our
<hi>Altars</hi> and <hi>Chimneyes,
Friends, Children, Laws</hi>
and <hi>Liberties.</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon this occasion
one man may safely
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59103:86"/>
and rationally be more
proud of a pair of
<hi>Crutches,</hi> than another
man, who hath meerly
obey'd the agitations
and stings of <hi>ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
ought in conscience
to be of a <hi>triumphal</hi>
Charriot.</p>
            <p>To all this we are
to add, that we, by this
means enjoying rest,
enjoy that which all
things, even to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<hi>inanimates</hi> tend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
with a strong appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
stones them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
violently rush
down to their Centre, &amp;
encrease their motion,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59103:86"/>
when they approach
it; flames and fire
mount upward impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of these Unctious
and Sulphureous Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
to which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
them. All things
tend to quiet and rest.
Consider but even the
nature of things, and
it will be found but a
mechanical <hi>protrusion,</hi>
clashing and <hi>arietation</hi>
of <hi>atoms,</hi> which scuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles
being once ceas'd,
they rest in <hi>shapes,</hi> and
quiet themselves into
a Body.</p>
            <p>But to go no further
than the <hi>minde</hi> of man,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59103:87"/>
all the <hi>passions</hi> and
<hi>traverses</hi> of it, are but
so many <hi>hurries</hi> and
<hi>tempests,</hi> and they must
be <hi>calmed</hi> before a man
can see himself, as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
must be smooth'd
which a man would
make a mirrour of.</p>
            <p>Or if a man give
himself to the pursuit
of <hi>sciences;</hi> there is no
way so advantageous
as quiet and a serene
attendance upon our
thoughts. Hence it was
that the <hi>Poets</hi> secluded
the <hi>Muses</hi> to Mount
<hi>Parnassus,</hi> to <hi>Fountains</hi>
and <hi>Groves,</hi> as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59103:87"/>
that <hi>Cities</hi> were not
places for any profound
and <hi>abstractive</hi> medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
much conversation
an enemy unto it. Out
of this reason I believe
it was that S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Henry
Wotton,</hi> after so many
<hi>Embassies</hi> and <hi>Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
concluded an <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphe</hi>
of his.</p>
            <q>Tandem hoc didici a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimas
sapientiores
fieri quiescendo.</q>
            <p>But least I may seem
to speak without
ground, and not out of
Experience, and the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59103:88"/>
things themselves, as
many subtle and aery
wits have done, whose
<hi>contemplations</hi> have
been <hi>rarified</hi> into such
thinness, that they have
<hi>vanish'd</hi> into nothing,
things and <hi>actions</hi>
being ever the best fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
and directors of
conceptions, whilest the
<hi>minde</hi> it self, <hi>towring</hi>
meerely by the strength
of its own notions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
looses it self in its
height, or falls down
out of weariness, it will
be but necessary that
I quote an <hi>example</hi> or
two, the one of a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:59103:88"/>
the other of a
<hi>Countreyman;</hi> the one
of as little <hi>merit</hi> as he
hath much <hi>fame;</hi> the
other of very small
<hi>fame,</hi> considering the
greatness of his <hi>worth.</hi>
'Tis <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> and
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Anthony Bacon,</hi> son
to the <hi>Lord Keeper
Bacon, Brother</hi> to the
<hi>Lord Chancellour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first being a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
souldier, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
bed-rid of his
wounds recollected
that great minde of his
which had been usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
employ'd in war,
into that fatall inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59103:89"/>
of the Order of
the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> which as in
its <hi>increase,</hi> it is in a
manner miraculous, so
in its <hi>discipline,</hi> it is no
less. For of what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
<hi>Physick</hi> except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
hath it not brought
forth excellent men in
great numbers? How
have they out-stript all
other Orders in a few
years, and were it not
for their blinde cursed
dependance upon the
<hi>Pope,</hi> whereby they
even wilfully put out
their own reason, and
that they are a sort
of men absolutely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59103:89"/>
to the <hi>aggrandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation</hi>
of their own
<hi>society,</hi> they were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
to be imitated
by the best <hi>Governments</hi>
on the earth. But as
Physitians say, that too
good a posture of health
is sickness, because the
humours, being in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilibration</hi>
may the
sooner be over-turned;
and we see the most
admirable inventions
have brought along
with them their incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,
so is this
sort of men, out of an
intended <hi>harmless</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
grown up into
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59103:90"/>
such <hi>artifice</hi> and <hi>insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation</hi>
of <hi>State,</hi> that
like your sutlest poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
they work most
dangerously and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
unseen, and have
been so inconsistent
with civill government,
that <hi>France</hi> once ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
them for a time,
and the state of <hi>Venice</hi>
for ever.</p>
            <p>For the other as he
<hi>writ</hi> nothing, so his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity</hi>
with-held him
from <hi>doing</hi> much. He
that could but consider
the marvellous spirit
of his Brother, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of <hi>Lamenesse</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:59103:90"/>
put into the scale, might
easily shape an <hi>Idaea</hi> of
him, but with this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion,
the one
<hi>tower'd</hi> into all the
heights of <hi>sciences,</hi> and
like an <hi>Eagle</hi> was one
of the first that could
behold <hi>intellectuall</hi>
truth, the other <hi>div'd</hi>
into the secrets of <hi>state,</hi>
and like a cruel <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralist,</hi>
left no <hi>vein</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>search'd.
The one had
a <hi>hand</hi> larger than his
<hi>Fortune,</hi> for all those
great <hi>offices</hi> and <hi>prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
he past through,
<hi>supply'd</hi> onely his state
and <hi>liberality</hi> into a
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59103:91"/>
great <hi>debt</hi> and a <hi>pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
not fit to be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
to posterity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ignominy to his
<hi>Prince.</hi> The other had
a <hi>providence</hi> so much
greater than his <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,</hi>
as you may say
exceeded on the other
side. He was a great
<hi>Transactour</hi> for the <hi>Essex</hi>
faction, when they and
the house of the <hi>Cecills,</hi>
upon the <hi>setting</hi> of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> strove
who should be the
greatest <hi>adorers</hi> of
<hi>rising</hi> King <hi>James.</hi> He
wanted not kindred on
the other side, which
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59103:91"/>
he knew very well, and
so cunningly used it,
that by throwing out
doubtfull and suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
words when he lay
bed-rid, he got <hi>Essex</hi>
house in the <hi>Strand</hi>
given him at one time
which, what he sold it
for, Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi>
will tell you, and also
ask you this question
<hi>What he would have
done if he had been
ble to walk.</hi> Certainly
he was a man of a <hi>vast</hi>
and a <hi>regular</hi> minde,
so great a <hi>Commander</hi>
of himself, and so much
a <hi>master</hi> in the <hi>Arts</hi>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:59103:92"/>
of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi>
that his Brother the
high <hi>Chancellour</hi> was
not to be blam'd, when
he wish'd his infirmity
upon himself, so that
the other might go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
about her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
service?</p>
            <p>What I have said of
this head, that is to say,
of <hi>Natural</hi> restraint, as
I may so call it, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
may very well
serve also for <hi>civill</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
or imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which though for
the most part it be but
temporary, as the other
is, and assures not of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59103:92"/>
a continuation so long
as life, yet it seems to
be accompany'd with
more horrours and
more dangers. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inflicted by the
civill Magistrate, it
seems but as an earnest
of some further punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the grounds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which most men
are thrown into Goales,
which we finde to be
either for the <hi>breach</hi>
of some law, or for
denying to act some
what against law, or
else such as whose <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts</hi>
have not been
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59103:93"/>
answered with success,
there will not any thing
so formidable be found
in it. For if it be the
former, it is our <hi>deserts,</hi>
and we ought to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to it, as to that
which the law impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
upon us for our
demerits, and at most
it is but a gentle school<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for an errour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the progress of the
party offending is <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi>
and it may be his
final ruine <hi>prevented,</hi>
while in the mean time
he is at <hi>leisure</hi> to look
into himself, and to
make use of his <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:59103:93"/>
for <hi>future</hi> causes.
If it be the second, what
more noble occasion
in the world of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
than in denying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to <hi>unjust</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
which certainly
may assure and pacifie
any resolv'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<hi>honesty,</hi> amidst the
greatest <hi>torments,</hi> much
more <hi>restraint.</hi> For
what greater satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
can any man have,
than the <hi>fruition</hi> of his
<hi>integrity</hi> though it be
<hi>clouded</hi> and covered
with never so much
<hi>misfortune?</hi> And for
the third, since it is not
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59103:94"/>
much more than the
<hi>fortune</hi> of the <hi>war,</hi> and
every man that <hi>attempts</hi>
must needs <hi>hazard,</hi> it
were <hi>unworthiness</hi> and
<hi>pusillanimity</hi> to <hi>attempt</hi>
if a man will not be
content with the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensations</hi>
of <hi>fortune,</hi> to
which we remit our
selves, withall not
knowing, how she in
her <hi>lubricity</hi> may every
moment change cases.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole it
will appear, that since
<hi>Restraint</hi> is the most
high happy and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
course of life, and
that our <hi>souls</hi> which are
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59103:94"/>
much nobler than our
<hi>Bodies,</hi> are much <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tag'd</hi>
thereby, and yet
these souls, though such
immortal and noble
substances, are but <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison</hi>'d
and <hi>pent</hi> up in
our <hi>bodies,</hi> it were a very
great injustice that the
<hi>body</hi> should ill resent
any <hi>confinement,</hi> when
that the immortal <hi>soul</hi>
that <hi>actuates</hi> it, is so
close a <hi>prisoner</hi> to the
<hi>body</hi> it self.</p>
