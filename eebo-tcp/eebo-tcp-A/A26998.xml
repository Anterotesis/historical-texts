            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Author of the following Tract is the Reverend Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> now enjoying that Glory he ſo converſed with in his mortal ſtate. Among his many Excellencies, his Love to God, to Peace, and Truth, was not the leaſt eminent. The laſt rendred him averſe to Logomachies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; well knowing, How vain all eriſtick debates be, if the Queſtion be not truly and plainly ſtated. This Book will give thee a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of that peculiar accuracy in this kind, as even determineth the Controverſie before an Argument be produced.</p>
            <p>It is not to be concealed, that ſome complain of the multitude of his diſtinctions; but ſuch may conſider, that the Comprehenſiveneſs of his Mind accommodated things to the most ſubtil, as well as the leſs intelligent Reader<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and provided againſt future Errours, as well as the miſtakes he attends to in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar points before him.</p>
            <p>Indeed he was a man born for more laſting
<pb facs="tcp:64665:3"/>
ſervice than one Age; yea, his Name will be greateſt, when impartial inquiſitiveneſs after Truth ſhall render men painful; and ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the miſchief of narrow and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Principles hath forced the confident to mutual allowances, and well ſtudied deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. But how unhappy was he (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch as miſtake him) that he is oft charged with deſerting this or that Truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he underſtood it in a conſiſtency with it ſelf, and ſuch other truths wherewith it was connected. As if Ort hodoxie muſt be ſacrificed when-ever a Doctrine is made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible; or the choice of terms more apt to confute the erroneous, leſs obnoxious to miſtakes, and moſt expreſſive of digeſted thoughts, ought to alarm all ſuch, who ſeem capable to know little more of Truth than the ſound of oft repeated Phraſes.</p>
            <p>Nay, as more convincing what treatment any man muſt expect, who ſets himſelf to heal a blind depraved World; The cleareſt repreſentation of his mind will not ſilence the ignorant from charging him with thoſe Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours which he moſt expreſly diſowns. Three of the moſt material are denied and confuted by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in this very Treatiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the moral freedom of the Will of an unregenerate man, conditional Election, and the merit of good Works as oppoſed to, or coordinate
<pb facs="tcp:64665:3"/>
with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. Neither must it be over-look'd, that it was his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in this Book above any other, to ſpeak as near to theſe points as his Judgment could admit; and in other Treatiſes he more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declares againſt them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Of Free-Will,</hi> p. <hi>87.</hi> he tells us, he denies that mans Will in his unregenerate ſtate is free from vitious inclination, or from the conduct of an erring Intellect, or from the Biaſs of Senſuality, <hi>&amp;c. 2.</hi> He denies that the Will thus vitiated, will ever deliver it ſelf without Gods <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> it being rather inclined to grow worſe. <hi>3</hi> As that degree of <hi>common Grace,</hi> which is in the unregenerate, is but ſuch as conſiſteth with the predominant <hi>Reign</hi> of Sin; ſo the Will of every unregenerate man in that pravity, is as a <hi>Slave</hi> to its own vitious dispoſitions, errour, and temptations. Who can ſay more againſt Free-Will? <hi>Obj.</hi> But he affirms the <hi>natural</hi> freedom of the Will. <hi>Anſw.</hi> He doth ſo, and explains it, <hi>p. 84, 85, 86, 91.</hi> and it is no more than that a Sinner is a man ſtill, tho' he be depraved; and he is a liberal, and not a forced Agent in what he acteth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But he ſaith, <hi>p. 88.</hi> That by common Grace a man may do more good and leſs evil than he doth. <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's true, he ſaith ſo. But, <hi>p. 85.</hi> he diſtinguiſheth between
<pb facs="tcp:64665:4"/>
               <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi> and denies that we can do that by common Grace, which is proper to ſpecial Grace: and ſaith, men have but juſt ſo much, and no more moral Liberty, and <hi>power,</hi> as they have of Gods Grace to relieve their vitiated Wills. See <hi>p. 91.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Of Conditional Election,</hi> p. <hi>99.</hi> He condemns the Notion called <hi>Scientia Media:</hi> p. <hi>100.</hi> he ſaith, God decreeth not mens Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Sanctification, meerly on <hi>Foreſight</hi> of our Faith: but decreeth our Faith it ſelf. Sin he permitteth, but Faith he effecteth, and <hi>decreeth to effect:</hi> and <hi>p. 101.</hi> he ſhews, how God decreeth both the means and end. And tho' God juſtly denieth his Grace to many that forfeit it by wilful reſiſtance and contempt; yet <hi>he takes not the Forfeiture of the Elect.</hi> Yea he adds, That he is deceived, and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God, that feigneth him to ſend his Son to redeem the World, and his Word to call them, and his Spirit to renew them; and all this <hi>at random,</hi> not knowing whether it may not all be loſt; or leaving it chiefly to the Free-Will of them, whoſe Wills are contrarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined and vitiated; whether Chriſt and all his preparations ſhall be loſt: <hi>p. 102.</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth the plain Chriſtian who holds that our deſtruction is of our ſelves, but our help and Salvation of God; and God is the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>chief</hi> Cauſe of all good, and men and Devils of all evil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64665:4"/>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But he will not ſay, that God hath by his Will and Decree ordained from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that men ſhall ſin, or will and chuſe evil, <hi>p. 100, &amp; 101.</hi> God doth not decree that men ſhall ſin, that they may be damned; for ſin is no work of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But yet he ſaith, <hi>p. 100.</hi> that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. God decreeth <hi>who</hi> ſhall de damned for ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he foreſaw mens ſins, not as an <hi>idle</hi> Spectator, but a willing Suſpender of his own Acts, ſo far as to leave Sinners to their ſelf-determining Wills. Reader, if thou art a man of thought, thou ſeeſt Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is clear for abſolute Election, tho' he did not think it neceſſary for the vindication thereof to judge, that God <hi>abſolutely</hi> decreed men to ſin, that he might damn them: it's enough, that it is from Gods Sovereign Will, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are not elected; it would be an eaſe to the damned, that they could juſtly ſay, God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed us to all our ſins, that he might bring us under all this puniſhment, a Non-election to Efficacious Grace, and a poſitive Decree to damn ſuch for ſin, which themſelves would chooſe, beſt ſuited with his Conceptions of Gods Goodneſs, Truth, and Purity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Of the Merit of good Works:</hi> Note, Reader, that he is not fond of the word <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> but his Adverſary leads him to the uſe of it, as thou mayſt ſee <hi>p. 96.</hi> But let us hear
<pb facs="tcp:64665:5"/>
what his ſence is of this point: <hi>p. 119.</hi> All Saints are ſaved by the full ſufficient Merits of Chriſt, and have <hi>none at all</hi> of their own, unleſs the amiableneſs of Grace freely given them, be <hi>called</hi> their Merit; and, <hi>p. 95.</hi> we do with <hi>Paul</hi> renounce <hi>all Works</hi> of our own, that are thought to make the reward to be of Debt, and not of Grace; and that are ſet in the <hi>leaſt</hi> oppoſition, or competition with Chriſts Merits, or in any place, ſave <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> ſubordination to him: nay, he ſays he firmly holds, That Works done with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of obliging God by Merit in commutative Juſtice, or as conceited ſufficient without a Saviour, and the pardon of their failings, do more further their Damnation, than Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yea, <hi>p. 97.</hi> none but Chriſt merited of ſtrict <hi>diſtributive</hi> Juſtice, according to the Law of Innocency, nor by any Works that will ſave from the charge of ſin, and <hi>deſert</hi> of death. And that thou mayeſt know what he aſcribes to our Graces, Holineſs, or Works: He tells us, <hi>p. 119.</hi> we mean by Merit but the moral aptitude for the reward of a free Benefactor, who alſo is Rector, when the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of a free gift ſuſpended on official con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, is ſapientially made a means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing obedience. This one Clauſe, if under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood (and he is a bold Traducer of ſo great a Man, that cannot underſtand words ſo
<pb facs="tcp:64665:5"/>
plain) will acquit Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and inform thee of the place of all Goſpel-<hi>Conditions. 1.</hi> All Gospel-bleſſings are the free gifts of Chriſt as Benefactor, they have their being without any regard to what we do, therefore nothing in man is a jot of the righteouſneſs or merit <hi>for</hi> which they are beſtowed. <hi>2.</hi> Chriſt is our Rector or Governor, he will rule us as well as be beneficent to us. <hi>3.</hi> As a means to incline us to comply with him as Rector, he ſuspends theſe bleſſings on terms of what he makes our Duty; and wiſely orders them as <hi>Motives</hi> to our Obedience. <hi>4.</hi> Any Act of our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is no more than a conformity to that <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of his, and doth not hinder all we receive from him to be of <hi>free gift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But he ſaith, that good Works are neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He doth ſo, and how few deny it? But, <hi>1.</hi> Not if a man dye as ſoon as he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; but if he have time, <hi>p. 94. 2.</hi> Their rewardableneſs is by Gods <hi>free Grace,</hi> and <hi>Promiſe,</hi> for the ſake of <hi>Chriſts</hi> meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Righteouſneſs, Sacrifice, and Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; their imperfection being pardoned, and their holineſs amiable through him: Theſe are his words, <hi>p. 76. 3.</hi> He ſaith; Not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or as a ſupplement to the Sacrifice, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and free Grace of Chriſt our Saviour, and Faith in him, <hi>p. 93, 75.</hi> And we give
<pb facs="tcp:64665:6"/>
our ſelves to Chriſt, as our Prophet, Prieſt, and King, to be ſaved by his <hi>Merits,</hi> p. <hi>94.4.</hi> He ſaith, our beſt Works will not ſave a man from the charge of ſin, and deſert of death, <hi>p. 97. 5.</hi> He denies that <hi>external Obedience</hi> is neceſſary to our admiſſion into a juſtified ſtate, as he ſhews in the Thief on the Croſs. And when he ſaith, we are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Faith, Godlineſs, and Works; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is not taken by him for the pardon of ſin, which he aſcribes wholly to the Merits of Chriſt; but he takes Juſtification there for our acquittance againſt the accuſation that we are <hi>Infidels, Ungodly,</hi> and <hi>Hypocrites.</hi> And ſaith, that againſt the charge, that we are <hi>Sinners, deſerving Hell,</hi> we are juſtified by <hi>Chriſt</hi> believed in, <hi>p. 94.</hi> His meaning is plainly this, <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone by his Merits forgives our ſins, and purchaſed eternal Life for us. But ſeeing that Christ hath promiſed to forgive none but the penitent Believer, and declared he will deſtroy all impenitent, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, ungodly ſinners: Now he thinks, that we muſt be truly acquitted, that we are not ſuch, or we ſhall not be ſaved by Chriſt: Yea, he thinks, that when God juſtifies a man for Chriſts Merits, he doth alſo declare a man to be a true Believer; becauſe he will juſtifie no other, and will juſtifie all ſuch; and when God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits a man into Glory, he doth even thereby
<pb facs="tcp:64665:6"/>
adjudge him a believing, penitent, holy, and upright man; and free from the charge of being an infidel, hypocritical, unholy Enemy; againſt whom the Gospel denounceth Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and bars relief. Let theſe things be weighed, and none will wonder that he ſhould ſay on his ſick bed, <hi>No works, I will leave out works, if he grant me the other:</hi> And truly, in health none ſpake more humbly of his own Works than he uſed to do. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome confident weak perſons have infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from that paſſage, that he changed his Principles when he came to dye; we ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thee, that after that paſſage was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by him, even the night before his death, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was asked, whether he was of the ſame ſentiments, as formerly, about Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification? He anſwered, That he had told the World ſufficiently his thoughts about it by ſeveral Writings, and otherwiſe; and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he referr'd them. And after a little pauſe, with his Eyes lifted up to Heaven, he cryed, <hi>Lord, pity, pity, pity the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this poor City.</hi> And in the time of his ſickneſs he declared to us and others, that his thoughts in theſe things were the ſame as formerly.</p>
            <p>Our regards to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> force the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what we here inſert; tho' we would not be judged ſo happy, as to arrive at his

            <p>THE Deceiver calleth his Book <hi>The Touchſtone of the Reformed Goſpel,</hi> as if he owned a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel diſtinct from that of the Reformed Church. And he undertakes to name fifty two points, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants affirm, but tells you not where, nor proveth his affirmation, but you muſt believe him as a <hi>Touchſtone</hi> of Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dec.</hi> The firſt Proteſtant affirmation feigned, is, <hi>That there is not in the Church One, and that an infallible Rule for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Holy Scripture, and conſerving of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in matters of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> A <hi>meer Lye,</hi> if he mean that this is any part of Proteſtant Doctrine; but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64665:8"/>
he may find as crude confuſed words, in ſome <hi>ignorant perſon</hi> that is called a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reformed Catholicks</hi> hold, that <hi>there is in the Church one, and that an infallible Rule for underſtanding the holy Scripture, and conſerving of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in matters of Faith.</hi>] And that Rule is, [<hi>The Evidence of its own meaning as inherent in its ſelf, diſcernible or intelligible by men prepared and inſtructed, by competent Teaching and Study, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary help of Gods Grace and Spirit.</hi>] This is that Rule.</p>
            <p>But the Reformed believe not 1. That there is any Rule by which ignorant, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced, heretical, wilfully blind, wicked, uncapable men can underſtand ſuch Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as they are hereby undiſpoſed to underſtand, unleſs by a great change made on themſelves. Nor that any Prince can make a Statute, which on Man can miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand, abuſe or violate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor that Men can underſtand it without <hi>teaching,</hi> and that <hi>ſound teaching,</hi> nor by hearkening to Erroneous Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor that the <hi>Slothfull,</hi> that will not meditate on it, can underſtand it, tho' they have the ſoundeſt teachers.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64665:8"/>4. Nor that <hi>Novices</hi> can underſtand as much in a ſhort time and ſmall Study, as aged long exerciſed Students.</p>

            <p n="6">6. Nor that any man, how holy ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, perfectly underſtandeth every word in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Nor that a perſon may not be <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,</hi> and <hi>deceived,</hi> that yet knoweth which is the <hi>Infallible Rule</hi>: It maketh not all <hi>Infallible</hi> that know it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Nor that any Church, or any Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſtians on Earth have ſuch a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity as conſiſteth in <hi>perfect knowledge and agreement in all matters of Faith,</hi> that is, of <hi>Scripture-record</hi> from God.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Nor that God hath tyed this Infallible Regulation to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or made <hi>him</hi> this <hi>Rule</hi>; ſeeing no ſuch word of God is extant, and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils have condemned Popes of Hereſie, Infidelity, Ignorance, and moſt brutiſh luſt and wickedneſs.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Nor that the Judgment of the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> or <hi>Biſhops</hi> is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rule; for 1. The Papal part are but a <hi>third part:</hi> And they will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe that the other two or three
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64665:9"/>
parts (<hi>Abiſſines, Egyptians, Syrians, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians, Georgians, Circaſſians, Greeks, Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi> Proteſtants) are the <hi>Infallible rule.</hi> 2. And if they met in an equal Council, they that are moſt out of <hi>the Council,</hi> would be the <hi>moſt in it.</hi> And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. and many others now condemned, have had the <hi>Major part.</hi> And <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> that thought that [<hi>few Biſhops or Prieſts were ſaved,</hi>] thought not the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to be the infallible Rule.</p>
            <p n="11">11. And Pope and Councils agreeing are not that <hi>Infallible rule</hi>; for <hi>two falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> makes not one <hi>infallible,</hi> nor two Knaves one honeſt Man. Popes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils have oft condemned one another; yea, they have oft agreed in evil, as did that at <hi>Laterane</hi> the 4th. under <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> that decreed the <hi>depoſition of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that exterminate not all</hi> that renounce not all Senſes and Humanity; for thoſe that have led into the Churches of the Weſt all the horrid Errors of <hi>Rome,</hi> to pretend yet that they are the <hi>Infallible rule of underſtanding Scripture,</hi> is Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency quite beyond that of Satan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p n="12">12. If this Deceiver hold what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his accuſed Proteſtant Opinion, he muſt condemn the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:64665:9"/>
that agreeth not of the ſenſe of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Texts of Scripture, Horſeloads of Commentators, and Cartloads of School-contenders, contradicting one another: And he that will ſay that all revealed in Scripture is not matter of Faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth God, as revealing that which is not to be believed. All matters of Faith are not <hi>eſſential</hi> to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but ſome are only for the <hi>perfection</hi> of it: All is matter of Faith that we are bound to believe as Divine Revelation. All the Scripture is ſuch, thô the ignorant muſt have time and help to underſtand it, and explicitely receive it. The Popes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (<hi>e. g. Sixtus Quintus,</hi> and <hi>Clem.</hi> 8.) have differed in many hundred Texts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the very Latine Tranſlation. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred Volumes of Controverſies among them, tell us how far they are from ending Controverſies, and agreeing in all matters of Faith: But in ſo much as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, all ſerious believing Proteſtants, or Reformed Catholicks, are agreed.</p>
            <p>Now, to trouble the Reader with the proof of any of theſe twelve particulars, would be but to abuſe Time and him; as to prove that no Man is perfect, and <hi>he that ſaith he hath no ſin, is a Lyar</hi>: and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64665:10"/>
to prove that the grand Deceivers of the Church are not Infallible, and that Gods Word is not unevident and unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that ſuch Villains as their own Councils and Hiſtorians ſay many Popes were, ſpeaks not more intelligibly and wiſely than God; and that the Volumes of Canons and Prieſts Writings are not of more evident meaning than Gods Word; theſe need proof to none but thoſe that are uncapable of it.</p>
            <p>What Rule is there for the Infallible underſtanding the ſence of all our Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Laws? none but what I mentioned. The intelligible evidence in the words, (what elſe are words uſed for) to men duely inſtructed and ſtudyed. The <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> govern by deciding particular cauſes by the Law, but are not an <hi>Infallible Rule</hi> for all Men to underſtand the true ſence of the Law by, (while Judges and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments differ from each other, as Popes and Councils did.)</p>
            <p>The Texts cited by the Deceiver, are ſo vilely abuſed, as if he purpoſed but to make ſport by taking Gods Word in vain.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Deceiver would Cheat the Ignorant by Confuſion; and belying the Reformed Catholicks: for,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It's falſe, that the Reformed hold any of this undiſtinguiſhing Aſſertion. They diſtinguiſh between <hi>humane Faith</hi> and <hi>Divine.</hi> (And I hope, <hi>God and Man</hi> may be diſtinguiſhed.) They ſay that it muſt be a <hi>Divine Faith</hi> (that is, The <hi>Belief of Gods word for the Infallible Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity of God</hi>) that muſt ſave us, and not the <hi>belief of Man alone</hi>: But that a <hi>humane Faith</hi> is <hi>needful</hi> in <hi>Subſerviency</hi> to a <hi>Divine.</hi> God hath appointed <hi>humane Teachers</hi> to the Flocks, and <hi>Oportet diſcentem Credere</hi>; He will never <hi>learn,</hi> that will <hi>believe</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on his Teachers Credit. But he muſt <hi>believe Man</hi> but <hi>as Man,</hi> an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, fallible Creature, yet as like to know more than he that chooſeth him for his Teacher; And that which Man is to teach us, is to ſee <hi>the Evidence of Gods own Word,</hi> that we may believe it for <hi>that Evidence,</hi> as our <hi>Teachers themſelves</hi> muſt do. For if the Teachers do but <hi>believe one another,</hi> and not <hi>God,</hi> (or God only for <hi>Man's Authority,</hi>) this is not <hi>Religion,</hi> nor <hi>Divne Faith,</hi> but <hi>humane,</hi> ſuch as they had that believed <hi>Pythagoras, Plato, Mahomet,</hi> &amp;c. If Boys learn of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64665:11"/>
their School-Maſter to underſtand the Greek or Latin Teſtament, and believe them as to Sence, this is not <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> but a help towards it. The word of God is Infallible: And by the help of fallible Men, (ſuch as diſagreeing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators be,) we are furthered for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it. But falſe bloody Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers are not the likeſt to teach us the Truth, nor fitteſt to be truſted.</p>
            <p>His Citations of Scriptures, (to miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Controverſies,) are ſo putidly <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, that I am aſhamed to detect them by words, which every Man may do.</hi>

               <head>The Third accuſed Point.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Scriptures are eaſy to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and therefore none are to be reſtrained from Reading them.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. We and all Papiſts with us agree, (the more is the Guilt of the Deceivers Fraud,) that ſome of the Scripture is eaſy to be underſtood, and is actually underſtood by all true Chriſtians, even all that is <hi>eſſentsal to Chriſtianity,</hi> and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation. Bellarmine, Caſtrus,</hi> and many others, tell us, that for <hi>all that,</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:64665:11"/>
the Scripture is plain and ſufficient: Yea, ſo it is, in many Thouſand particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Texts: If this be not ſo, let this Man tell us if he can, how it cometh to paſs, that Papiſts, Greeks, and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Commentators agree of the meaning of moſt of the Scripture, (perhaps of Nineteen Texts in Twenty,) if it be not plain.</p>
               <p>But do Proteſtants ſay, that there <hi>is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> in the Scripture hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood? the Father of Lyes will ſcarce affirm this of them, leſt their Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries and Controverſies ſhame him.</p>

               <p n="8">8. Whether he that thus Condemneth God and his Law, and extolleth Man's, be like to make good his accuſation at God's Barr? Alas! muſt ſuch things as theſe be diſputed by Men that would be our Infallible Rule?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Either the knowledge of God's Word is needful, or not. If not, why did God write part of it himſelf? And ſend his Son to Preach it? And his Spirit in his Prophets and Apoſtles to write and Record it? Are blind Worms fit to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe God of Folly, and needleſs Work? Can Men obey God's Law that know it not?

And is it not by his Law that God Governeth, and by his Goſpel that Chriſt Saveth, and the Holy Ghoſt doth illuminate and Sanctifie? And doth not that Man or Clergy then put down God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, and ſet up themſelves in the ſtead, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the reading of God's Law and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,

And whether the People were bound to believe them, (as Jewiſh Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,) and whether all the Apoſtles and Chriſtians were Rebels and Hereticks, for not believing them? And whether it was not for the Sins of Prieſts and Princes, and the peoples complying with them, that God by his Prophets reproved the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and at laſt forſook them to Captivity, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> laſt. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5 laſt.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64665:14"/>
that is none of the Controverſie. But whether their Teachers muſt teach them to <hi>underſtand God's</hi> Book, or to <hi>throw it away</hi>? May not the <hi>Teacher</hi> and the <hi>Book,</hi> conſiſt together? Muſt School-Boys be forbid to Learn their Grammar, becauſe they muſt have a Teacher? Muſt he teach them the Book, or teach them without Book? But all the Craft is, to get all the World to take only ſuch Cheaters as this for their Maſters, and then Bible or no Bible may ſerve turn.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Is it not the Office of Teachers to Tranſlate God's Word into known Tongues, that the People may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it? This is the firſt part of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: If not, why do they uſe Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Vulgar Latin? And why did <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5th. and <hi>Clem.</hi> 8. make ſuch a ſtir to Correct the Latin? And why do ſo many Comment on them? And the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> turn it into <hi>Engliſh</hi>? But what is all this for, but to help Men to underſtand the Book?</p>
               <p n="17">17. Doth not all the Word of God cry down Ignorance, and cry up Knowledge, from End to End? And what Knowledge is it, but <hi>Divine,</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> of God? What elſe is the ſcope of all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64665:15"/>
the firſt Nine Chapters of <hi>Solomons</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs, and of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 19. and 119, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God ſaith, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>My People periſh for lack of knowledge</hi>: And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 11. <hi>It is a people of no underſtanding, therefore he that made them will not ſave them.</hi> Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Blindneſs are made the common cauſe of Errour, Sin and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
               <p>But we are ſo far from taking all parts of Scripture to be equally neceſſary to be underſtood, that we are more than the Papiſts for firſt and moſt diligently teaching them the Eſſentials, the Creed, Lord's Prayer, and Commandments, and Baptiſm, and Church Communion, and the Lord's Supper, and leſſer parts as they grow up; what they muſt learn firſt their Teachers muſt inſtruct them.</p>
               <p n="18">18. If he ſay, as they ſtill do, that the <hi>Ignorant will miſunderſtand the Scripture,</hi> and every one turn it to his own Fancy, and Hereſie: I anſwer, The way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this, is to teach it them diligently, (what elſe is the Miniſtry for?) and not to forbid it them. Every Knave may pervert the Law of the Land to maintain his own ill Cauſe; and muſt the Law therefore be forbidden them? Reaſon is far more commonly abuſed than Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64665:15"/>
There is no Hereſie, or Error, no Villany, Perjury, Cruelty, Perſecution, Oppreſſion, or Injuſtice, but Reaſon is pleaded for it: Muſt Reaſon therefore be renounced? Hereſies are for want of underſtanding God's word; and muſt be cured by underſtanding it.</p>
               <p n="19">19. And if all the World muſt take the Popes or Prieſts words, inſtead of Gods, or for their Rule, how ſhall thoſe in <hi>Aethiopia, Syria, America,</hi> or here, know what the Popes Word is? That never ſee him, or any that hath ſeen him? And how ſhall we know, when above twenty times there have been two Popes at once, which of them is the Right? And when they contradict and Damn each other, which of them muſt we believe? And when General Councils accuſe them of Errour, and Condemn them, which is to be truſted with our Souls? Or if it be Councils that muſt be to us inſtead of Scripture, when they Damn each other, which muſt we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? (And ſo abundance of them have done.) When the Pope and they agreed to depoſe Chriſtian Princes, and give away their Dominions, and diſoblige their Subjects from all their Oaths of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, is it as true as the word of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64665:16"/>
God, that all Subjects muſt believe and obey them?</p>
               <p>But how ſhall all the poor People know what the Pope and Councils ſay and hold? They can neither read their Volumes, nor underſtand them, nor know which are authentick and true? Muſt they all believe their Pariſh Prieſt? What if he be as very a Deceiver as the writer of this Touchſtone, that doth but Cheat from the beginning to the end? Yet muſt we take his word inſtead of Gods? Or when other Prieſts, or Fryars contradict him, which of them muſt we believe? What if his Pariſhoners know him to be ignorant, or a common Lyar? Yet muſt our Salvation reſt on his word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and God's word be forbidden us. What if we obey him in Error, and Sin, will he undertake to be Damned for us? Or will his undertaking or Damnation ſave thoſe whom he miſlead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>?</p>
               <p>As to his Citation of Scripture againſt Scripture, it is ſo palpable a perverſion, that I will leave any Man that will but Read the Text, to his own ability, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him: <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.1. <hi>No Man in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Earth, was worthy to open the Sealed Books</hi> that <hi>John</hi> ſaw in his Viſion: What then, muſt no Man therefore open the

               <p>And with as ſhameleſs a Face doth he cite the Fathers, againſt the drift of all their writings and Labours, and the Judgment of all the Churches of Chriſt, for many hundred years, of its pureſt foundeſt Primitive times.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>That Apoſtolical Traditions, and ancient Cuſtoms of the Church, (not Founded in the written word,) are not to be received, nor do oblige us.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is but more Deceit, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and falſe report.</p>
               <p>The Reformed Catholicks hold,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Memory is not ſo ſure a way to deliver any Laws and Doctrines to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, through many hundred years, as writing is. For it muſt lie on the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſo many Thouſands, in ſo many Ages, and ſo many parts of the World; Of ſo many Languages, Kingdoms, and croſs Intereſts and Opinions in their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64665:17"/>
quarrels; and the things to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred are ſo many, that this needs no proof, with any but Fools or Mad-men: What a Religion ſhould we have had, if inſtead of the Bible, it muſt have all been brought us down by the Memories of all the Rabble of ignorant and wicked Popes? yea, or of the beſt? and by the Memories of all the Prelates and Prieſts that have pretended to be the Church? Why do they themſelves write their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Traditions, if writing them were not needful? And why have we all our Statutes, Records, and Law-Books, if the Lawyers and Peoples Memories would keep and deliver them without theſe? When Men's Memories, Wits, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty are ſo weak, that we can ſcarce get one Story carried without falſifying through many Hands.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We hold, that God in mercy hath therefore conſidered Man's Weakneſs, and Neceſſity, and before the Apoſtles died, inſpired them to Record ſo much of his Law, and Goſpel, and Will, as was univerſally neceſſary for all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to know, in order to Divine belief; Obedience, and Salvation: And hath left nothing of this importance and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity unrecorded in the Law of Nature,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64665:17"/>
(God's Viſible works,) and Scripture, knowing that after Ages were not to have new univerſal Legiſlators, to make ſuch Laws for all the World; nor to have Men miraculouſly enabled to do it, and give proof that it is Divine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We hold that God's written Word and Law, is perfect in its kind, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. and ſufficient to its proper uſe and end: Which <hi>Bellarmine, Caſſinus,</hi> and the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> and many School-men, in their Prologues on the Sentences, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs extendeth to all things commonly neceſſary to Salvation, yea, and to be the Divine Rule of Faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet we deny not, that if God had ſeen meet to deliver any neceſſary part of Law or Goſpel, Faith or Practice, as his will, by bare word and Memory of Man; we had been bound to believe and obey it, when we had ſound proof that it was indeed from God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We hold, that for fulleſt certainty, we have poſſeſſion of the Bible it ſelf, and of the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity brought us by two Means Conjunct, that is, <hi>The Scripture,</hi> and practical Cuſtom of the <hi>Church.</hi> As the Scripture or written Word ſhineth to us by its own Light, ſo Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition tells us which be the Canonical
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64665:18"/>
Books, and how the Church received them as Divine, and that there are no other ſuch: And the practice, of Baptiſmal Profeſſion and Covenanting, and of the Church Aſſemblies, and reading Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Catechizing, and of Euchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Communion, and Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tell us what in all Ages hath been taken for true Chriſtianity. As we hold a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Belief, needful in Subſerviency, as a means to Divine Belief, ſo we hold <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Tradition</hi> needful to the conveyance of God's Word to us. But, by your leave, we will diſtinguiſh the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> from the <hi>Authour:</hi> If the King ſend me a Law or Mandate by a Meſſenger, or by the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-Poſt, I will receive and obey it, and yet not take the Poſt or Meſſenger for King, or Legiſlator, or Infallible.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And the Reformed Catholicks do own all true Tradition, but are for a far ſurer Tradition than the <hi>Roman</hi> Sect. Our Tradition of Scripture, and the great points of Chriſtianity, cometh to us by Evidence Infallible, that may be called Natural, with the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Moral Evidence alſo; and not on the boaſt and bare word of one proud Sect, that pretendeth to Fanatick Inſpiration and Authority above all others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:64665:18"/>I call that <hi>Natural Evidence,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth from ſuch <hi>neceſſary</hi> Cauſes that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwiſe, nor can deceive: And I call that the beſt Moral Evidence, which cometh from Mens teſtimony of greateſt credit for skill and honeſty, and we have both theſe.</p>
               <p>Mans Soul hath ſome neceſſary acts that cannot <hi>but be,</hi> and <hi>cannot be otherwiſe</hi>: Such is <hi>ſenſation</hi> of <hi>ſenſible objects duely preſented; Intellectual perception</hi> of things preſented according to the evidence in which they appear: The <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>our ſelves</hi> and <hi>our own known welfare,</hi> and any thing that is known to be an <hi>only and neceſſary means</hi> thereto, and hath <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modam ratiomem boni</hi>: The Love of <hi>Truth</hi> as <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> as <hi>Good</hi>: The <hi>hatred of miſery,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe all Men have as men, and that which dependeth on theſe dependeth not only on mens honeſty. And our evidence of Tradition is ſuch as this. It is from the Common Conſent of all capable Witneſſes, of various Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, Paſſions and Intereſts, Friends and Foes; whereas the Tradition of Sectari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Papiſts, dependeth on the Credit of one Sect, that falſly pretend a peculiar truſt with both Scripture and Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tho' againſt the greater part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64665:19"/>
And pretend Fanatically that even ignorant Popes and Prelates in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, have a gift of infallible knowledge.</p>
               <p>For Example: If there were a doubt raiſed, Whether there be any ſuch City in the World as <hi>Rome, Paris, Vienna?</hi> or whether there was ever ſuch perſons as K. <hi>James,</hi> K. <hi>Charles, Ludovicus</hi> 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>France,</hi> &amp;c.? Or whether the Statutes in our Books were really made by the Kings and Parliaments named in them, and be the ſame unchanged, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is <hi>Natural evidence</hi> of all this, becauſe it ariſeth from neceſſary <hi>acts</hi>: All ſorts of men of contrary intereſts could never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to lie and deceive men in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, no more than they could all agree to kill themſelves: And if ſome would be falſifyers, the reſt would preſently detect and ſhame them: If any Lawyers would falſyfie or change the Statutes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would preſently manifeſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, they being commonly known, and the croſs intereſts of ſo many depending on them; yea, I ſay not only that this is Natural Infallible Evidence, but that it is more than very much other Phyſical Evidence of many other things; becauſe we have better means to know Mans Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural neceſſary acts, than we have to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64665:19"/>
know moſt other Creatures of God.</p>
               <p>And then for <hi>Moral Evidence,</hi> we have all the Godly's atteſtation of all Ages, and Nations, and Sects of Chriſtians, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt the Papiſts alſo, agreeing that <hi>This Bible,</hi> and <hi>This Creed,</hi> and theſe Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, were all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly tranſmitted to us from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Spirit,</hi> in his <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what's the Tradition of the Papal Sect to all this, who tell us falſely, you <hi>cannot know the Scripture to be God's Word, but by taking it on the belief of the Pope and Church of Rome, as Endowed with the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Judgment, and the gift of Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> Alas! what abundance of Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities muſt be proved true, before any Man can by this method believe God's word!</p>
               <p n="1">1. Before they can believe the Goſpel, and that Jeſus is the true Chriſt, they muſt believe that he hath a Vicar.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And a Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And the Pope is this Vicar, and his Sect this Church. And</p>
               <p n="4">4. That he hath the Office, Power and Gift, of infallible Judging, which the Major number of Chriſtians or Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches have not.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:64665:20"/>5. And that Chriſt (not yet believed in,) gave him power and Infallibility.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And that he that now Reigneth, is the true Pope by due Election, Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Qualification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> With many more ſuch Impoſſibilities: And what is it to give up the Cauſe to the Infidels, if this be not?</p>
               <p n="7">7. But we judge that God's Law in Scripture, ſecured from the charge of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Rememberers</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers,</hi> is ſo ſufficient to its proper uſe, that there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no <hi>Supplemental Tradition,</hi> as if it were but half God's Law; but only <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient hiſtorical Tradition.</hi> And we chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the Papiſts to prove <hi>de facto,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That any ſuch ſupplemental Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Exiſtent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they poſſeſs any other, but what the other Churches know.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they are more than other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, authorized to be the Keepers and Judges of that Tradition. And</p>
               <p n="4">4. We fully prove them Innovators, and that Popery is a meer Novelty: It is copiouſly proved by <hi>Peter Moulin, de no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate Papiſmi, David Blondel de Eccleſia, Andrew Rivet</hi> Defence of <hi>Morney</hi> againſt <hi>Coffetean,</hi> and againſt <hi>Silveſter,</hi> and many others.

               <p n="8">8. If Tradition tell us of any Cuſtoms uſed in the Apoſtles, or Primitive times, that be not in Scripture, and ſo be not made matters of Neceſſity to all; yea, or of any occaſion all <hi>mutable Cuſtoms</hi> that are <hi>mentioned in Scripture,</hi> (as <hi>waſhing the Saints Feet, the Holy Kiſs, the Womans Vail, long or ſhort Hair, Collections each Lords Day, Preachers Travelling on Foot, &amp;c.</hi>) we quarrel not with the then uſe of ſuch Traditions, when they were ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, no more than with forbearing things ſtrangled and blood: Nor quarrel we with the Churches after, that ſetled <hi>Eaſter</hi> Day, and made the <hi>20th.</hi> Canon of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and uſed divers Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies at Baptiſm.

               <p n="9">9. We maintain openly, that <hi>Tradition is againſt the Papacy and its Corruptions.</hi> They are but a third or fourth part of Chriſtians: The other two or three parts of the Chriſtian World, profeſs that the <hi>Tradition</hi> of <hi>their Churches</hi> is <hi>againſt the Popes univerſal Sovereignty,</hi> and againſt all the Corruptions of which they accuſe him. None but the ſhameleſs will deny that the <hi>Abaſſians, Armenians, Greeks,</hi> and others, plead that this is <hi>their Tradition.</hi> And Reader, tell us, why the Tradition of <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three parts</hi> of the Church ſhould not rather be believed againſt a <hi>third part,</hi> than that which the <hi>third part</hi> boaſt of againſt all <hi>the reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Ask them <hi>which way</hi> they know and keep their Traditions? Whether they have any Hiſtory, Records, or any other way which we may not know as well as they? If they pretend that it is a Secret, kept by their Church, it's a ſtrange Secret that ſo many Thouſands know: But if it be a thing proveable, let them prove it.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Is it not unmercifulneſs, to tell all the Chriſtian World, that as big and hard as the Bible is, if they knew and obeyed it

and God's Spirit, without taking the <hi>Sence only at the rebound,</hi> on the <hi>belief of the Pope and his Clergy.</hi> For we never thought that a Man's own natural Wit <hi>without a Teacher,</hi> and the help of <hi>God's Spirit,</hi> can ſavingly underſtand and apply the Scripture.</p>
               <p>And yet we would fain tell Papiſts a better way to Convert a Philoſopher, or a Turk, than to Preach to them thus: <hi>God hath written his Law and Goſpel to the World, but you cannot tell what is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, till you take that ſence on truſt from our Pope and Clergy, and know that Chriſt authorized him to be Judge; and that before you believe in Chriſt, or underſtand the word that ſo authorizeth him.</hi> Were not corrupted Nature very blind in things Spiritual, Plow-men, and Tinkers, and Coblers, would be able to confute ſuch Fopperies, and much more Prieſts, and Popes, and Prelates.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But I pray you tell me, whether the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Prelates,</hi> do not <hi>interpret Scripture by their own underſtandings?</hi> Whoſe underſtandings elſe do they judge by, in Conclaves or Councils?</p>
               <p n="5">5. And tell me, whether he that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Pope is <hi>Chriſts Vice-Chriſt and Ruler,</hi> at the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and is <hi>infallible,</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Oh!

               <p n="1">1. Proteſtants are further from the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that <hi>Peters</hi> Faith failed, than the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Papiſt Doctors: Some Proteſtants hold that no Man that hath true ſaving Faith, doth ever totally loſe it; much leſs <hi>Peter.</hi> Others hold, that <hi>no Elect</hi> Perſon that hath true Faith, doth totally loſe it: And ſo thought <hi>Auguſtine</hi>: Others add, that though ſome, as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>quale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque ſemen ſidei perderint,</hi> having no more immutable Grace than <hi>Adam</hi> had in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, yet all that have a Confirmed Radicated Habit, perſevere. And as to <hi>Peters</hi> Faith, all ſave thoſe called <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> agree, (as far as I know,) that his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64665:24"/>
Faith was not totally loſt, nor <hi>Peter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed into a State of Damnation: But will all the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſay as much?</p>
               <p>We commonly hold that the <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Peters</hi> Faith, muſt be diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Acts,</hi> and the <hi>Act of Aſſent</hi> from the Act that exciteth <hi>Confeſſion and conquereth Oppoſition.</hi> And that <hi>Peters</hi> Faith did not totally fail as to the <hi>Habit,</hi> nor the <hi>Aſſent,</hi> that Chriſt was the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> But that it actually failed as to the latter Act, that ſhould <hi>conquer Fear:</hi> Chriſt ſaid to him and the reſt before that, <hi>Why are ye fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, O ye of little Faith: Little Faith, is Faith failing in Degree. This is our Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over the World, even our Faith,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John.</hi> And did not <hi>Peters</hi> Faith fail as to part of that Victory, when he Curſt and Swore that he knew not the Man?</p>
               <p>But by <hi>Peters</hi> Faith, this Deceiver mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Popes Faith: And he inſtanceth in the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that were to be heard becauſe they Sate in <hi>Moſe's</hi> Chair, and in <hi>Cajaphas</hi> the High-Prieſt. Reader, ſee what Chriſtians theſe Slaves of Chriſts pretended Vicar are: Doth he not plainly infer, that the people did well that believed the Prieſts, and the <hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that Chriſt was a Deceiver and workt Miracles by the Devil; and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64665:25"/>
was a Blaſphemer and a Traytor, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Death; and that cryed <hi>Away with him: Crucifie him?</hi> And what wonder if they obey their High Prieſt, when he Commandeth them to Murther Thouſands and Hundred Thouſands Saints Nicknamed Hereticks, when they juſtifie them that killed Chriſt and the Apoſtles, becauſe the Church Commanded it, (unleſs they will renounce their own plain Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence?)</p>
               <p>And muſt we indeed believe, that the Popes Faith never failed, becauſe <hi>Peters</hi> did not? Then we muſt believe that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils that are their Church, have been very falſe and ſlanderous. Reader, I will give thee but an Account of one or two, (when their own moſt flattering Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians have written of many a long time, that they were rather <hi>Apoſtatict,</hi> than <hi>Apoſtolici,</hi> and named but to keep the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of time.)</p>
               <p>The great General Council at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> (that Burnt <hi>John Hus</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> for Truth and Honeſty,) finding three Popes Heading three Churches called <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks,</hi> had no way to return to Unity, but by putting down all three: With much adoe they got down two of them: But Pope <hi>John</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> had the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64665:25"/>
faſteſt hold, and they had more adoe to get him down; and had not the Emperour reſolved to back them, they had been foiled. Hereupon he is accuſed in the Council, Firſt, by Fifty Four Articles, of ſuch Monſtrous Villanies, as one would think humane Nature were uncapable of. Afterward many more are added, of Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> of Inceſt with his Brothers Wife, and the Holy Nuns, and Raviſhing Maids, and Adultery with Men's Wives, and much more; and of Simony, almoſt incredible: And amongſt the reſt, (which I forbear to recite, leſt I tire the Reader,) they ſay and prove, that he <hi>was a notorious Simoniack,</hi> and a <hi>portinacious Heretick; That oft before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Prelates,</hi> and other <hi>Honeſt Men,</hi> by <hi>the Devils perſwaſion he pertinaciouſly ſaid, aſſerted, dogmatized, and maintained, that there is no Life Eternal, nor any after this: And he ſaid and pertinaciouſly believed, that Man's Soul dieth with the Body, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, as are the Bruits: And he ſaid, that the Dead riſe not, contrary to the Articles of the Reſurrection, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Articles being ſhewed to the Pope, he <hi>confeſt his Sin,</hi> and <hi>conſented to be Depoſed,</hi> and begged Mercy, but all in Hypocriſie, while he ſought to get out of their Hands and Power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:64665:26"/>And now Reader, doſt thou think that it is the mark of a Heretick, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Burning and Damnation, for a Man to think that this Popes Faith failed? Were it not for tiring you, I would repeat ſuch Articles againſt many others of them, as would make you think, that not only the Heathen Philoſophers, but even <hi>Mahomet</hi> was a Saint in compariſon of theſe Swiniſh and Diabolical Popes.</p>
               <p>After this, the Great Council at <hi>Baſil</hi> accuſed <hi>Eugenius</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> of Hereſie and multitudes of horrid Crimes, and depoſed him: But he outfaced them, and ſtanding it out to the laſt, got the better, and the Succeſſion is ever ſince continued from this Pope, that was depoſed by a grand Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council.</p>
               <p>Before theſe, Pope <hi>John</hi> the <hi>12th.</hi> was depoſed by a Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> called by <hi>Otho</hi> the Emperour, for ſuch horrid Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies, as no Pagans that we read of ever matcht. Read them but in <hi>Baronius,</hi> and <hi>Binnius</hi>: Drinking Healths in Wine to the Devil, and calling at Dice upon <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> beſides Murders, Simony, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt and all Wickedneſs, are all conſiſtent with Papal Faith: And if this be no failing, I ſhall grant that the Popes Faith (nor the Devils,) can never fail.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:64665:27"/>Reader, is it not worſe than Infidelity that theſe Men teach, if they ſay that the Church hath not Erred? Was it no Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror when <hi>Aaron</hi> ſet them up the Golden-Calf? nor when they went after the Idols of the Heathen, and worſhipped in the High places? Was it no Error to take Chriſt for a Deceiver and Blaſphemer, worthy to be Crucified? Was it no Error to reject the Goſpel, and perſecute the Apoſtles?</p>
               <p>And had the Apoſtles no Error, when they believed not that Chriſt muſt Die for our Sins, and riſe again, and aſcend to Heaven, but thought he muſt then ſet up an Earthly Kingdom? Was it no Error of <hi>Peter, Math.</hi> 16. to diſſwade Chriſt from Suffering, for which Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Get thee behind me Sathan, thou ſavoureſt not the things that be of God, but thoſe that be of Men</hi>? And I think he Erred, when <hi>Paul</hi> openly rebuked his Separation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>If <hi>all the Church</hi> on Earth conſiſt only of <hi>perſons that have many Errors,</hi> then <hi>the whole Church hath many Errors:</hi> But the Antecedent is ſo true, that I take him that denyeth it, to be ſo far from knowing what the <hi>Church</hi> is, or what a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is, that he knoweth not what a <hi>Man</hi> is,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64665:28"/>
and a Church of ſuch are ſo unfit to be truſted as infallible, with all Mens Salvation, that they have not the Wit of common il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate Men, or Children: And if in all things elſe they were as mad as in theſe two Opinions. 1. <hi>That the Church never did nor can Err.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And that <hi>all Mens Senſes muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed for Tranſubſtantiation</hi>; doubtleſs they ſhould be kept in <hi>Bedlam</hi> from humane Converſe.</p>
               <p>But for my part, I do not think that any Man of them not ſtark mad, doth believe himſelf that there are any men in the World that have no Error, (that have any uſe of Underſtanding.) He is far from knowing what <hi>Man</hi> is, that knoweth not that he ſwarmeth with Errours: I oftner doubt whether the greater number of moſt mens thoughts, are true or falſe.</p>
               <p>But if by the <hi>Church</hi> they mean only the <hi>Pope,</hi> if he cannot Err, then it is no Errour to believe that there is no Life but this, and that Mans Soul dieth as the Beaſts, and that it is lawful to Murther Gods Servants by Thouſands, or hundred Thouſands; if all the foreſaid Popes in the ages 800, 900, 1000, 1100, Erred not, ſure there is no ſuch thing as Errour in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:64665:28"/>But perhaps by the Church is meant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Councils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 1. If they Erred not in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, doth it follow that therefore they had no Errour?</p>
               <p n="2">2. But did not the ſecond Council at <hi>Epheſus</hi> Err? Where they tell us that <hi>Sola Petri Navicula,</hi> only the Popes Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers eſcaped the Hereſie? Did not the Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi> Err in their Opinion, when it determined that the Reaſon of <hi>Romes</hi> Primacy was becauſe it was the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Seat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>? Were all the Councils free from Errour that were for the <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?</hi> And thoſe that were againſt them? And all that were for the <hi>Monothelites?</hi> And thoſe that were againſt them? And all that were for Images, and thoſe that were againſt them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>?</p>
               <p>But at laſt they come to this, that the Pope may Err, and Councils may Err, but when they agree, they cannot Err: A happy meeting of Erring perſons, if they are both cured by it. But ſure it is not the meeting: For the Pope is at <hi>Rome,</hi> when the Council is at <hi>Trent, Epheſus, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, &amp;c.</hi> If a Council may Err, and the Pope Err, what proveth it impoſſible for them to agree in Errour? The Pope and Council at <hi>Lateran</hi> 4th. agreed for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64665:29"/>
the Popes depoſing Princes that Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate not all out of their Dominions that deny Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Was this no Errour?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. But this was not a matter of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Is it no matter of Faith with them, <hi>Whether it be Lawful or not,</hi> according to Gods Law, to kill men that believe their Senſes, and to depoſe Princes? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Subjects may break their Oaths of Allegiance, and forſake their Prince if the Pope Command them, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Prince will not be a Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer or Perſecutor? Theſe are no matters of Faith with them? But ſure they have made them Articles of their Religion. And either the Rebels, and Murtherers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Pope and Council Err, or elſe Gods Law and Goſpel Err.</p>
               <p>The Judgment of the Reformed Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks is this,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is no man living without Errour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Apoſtles of Chriſt were Commiſſioned to deliver his Goſpel to the World, by Word and Record, and had his promiſe of his Spirit to lead them into all Truth, and keep them from doing that Work Erroneouſly which they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned to do: (Tho' not to make them
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64665:29"/>
abſolutely free from Sin or Errour in all other things.) And therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture written by them is free from Errour, by Virtue of the ſpecial promiſe and Spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That all true Chriſtians, (really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,) are free from all Errour, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with true ſaving Faith, and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to Salvation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That therefore the <hi>Church</hi> as it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth only the ſaid regenerate true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, hath no Damning Errour, or none but what is pardoned, as conſiſtent with ſaving Faith and Holineſs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the Univerſal Viſible Church, is the whole Company of men on Earth, that profeſs true ſaving Faith, and are by Covenant Vow Baptized into this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: And that all this true Viſible Church, <hi>profeſſeth no Errour,</hi> inconſiſtent with <hi>their Profeſſion</hi> of the <hi>foreſaid ſaving Faith:</hi> Becauſe the <hi>profeſſion of ſaving Faith</hi> is <hi>eſſential</hi> to <hi>viſible Chriſtianity,</hi> and to the <hi>viſible Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For mark, that I ſay not that they <hi>profeſs no Errour inconſiſtent with ſincere Faith in themſelves ſubjectively,</hi> nor yet that as to <hi>objective Faith,</hi> may not by <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen conſequence</hi> overthrow it: For there is ſuch a concatenation of Divine revealed

Truths, that it is a doubtful caſe, whether any one Errour (which all men have,) do not by remote Conſequence ſubvert the very Foundations. But no true Viſible Church or Chriſtian, ſo <hi>profeſſeth</hi> any one Errour, as not to <hi>profeſs the eſſential points</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> tho' they may think falſely that <hi>both are true.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Proteſtants teach, that unſeen Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences are not to be ſo charged on thoſe that ſee them not, and hold faſt the (injured) Truth, as if it were a known or direct denyal of the Truth.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But every Church, and every man, being imperfect both in knowledge, Faith and Holineſs, have all ſome Errour: For to be objectively <hi>de fide,</hi> is to be <hi>of Divine Revelation:</hi> And all the Scripture is <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation.</hi> And if the queſtion be, Whether any Pope, Council or Church, underſtand all the Scripture without any Errour? judge by <hi>Commentators,</hi> and common Experience.</p>
               <p>And now what ſaith the Deceiver a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all this?</p>
               <p n="1">1. He citeth <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.21. God hath promiſed to preſerve his Word in the Church: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Church cannot Err? A forged Conſequence, no more follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but that the true Church ſhall not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64665:30"/>
loſe or forſake Gods Word: For then it would ceaſe to be the Church:</p>
               <p>But 1. Not that the beſt Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all that Word without any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor that any particular Church viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble may not apoſtatize, or turn Hereticks, or corrupt Gods Word, and forbid men to uſe it in a known Tongue, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts do.</p>
               <p>Next he citeth <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16. As if all the Church had the ſame promiſe of the Spirit of Infallibility, as the Apoſtles had: If ſo, then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Papiſts are none of the true Church, becauſe they have many Errours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And if the major part be the Church, rather than a minor Sect, then all other Chriſtians that are againſt Popery are free from Errour, for they are twice or thrice as many as the Papiſts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And when the far greater part were <hi>Arrians,</hi> they were free from Errour: Yea, the Council of <hi>Sirmium,</hi> to which Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> profeſſed full conſent. Or did Chriſt break his promiſe to all theſe?</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the Pope or all his Prelates, have as full a promiſe of the Spirit as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, then they may write us a new Bible, and Word of God, as they did: No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64665:31"/>
then if the Canons and Decretals be as much Gods Word as the Bible? But why then do they not confirm their Canons by Miracles as the Apoſtles did? And why did ſo many Popes contradict each other? Had both <hi>Stephanus, Formoſus, Nicholas,</hi> and the foreſaid <hi>Johns</hi> that denyed the Life to come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſame Gift as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? Surely we may well ſay to them as St. <hi>James, Shew me thy Faith by thy Works?</hi> They did ſhew it by moſt odious Simony, Gluttony, Drunkenneſs, Lying with Maids and Wives, even at the Apoſtolick Doors, Murdering Chriſts Members by Thouſands, Silencing faithful Preachers, Depoſing Emperours, Commanding Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and Rebellion, even to Sons againſt their own Fathers: Forbidding all Church Worſhip of God to whole Kingdoms for many years, when a King will not obey the Pope: By ſuch Works they ſhew their Faith! O the power of Satan, and the horrid pravity of man, when ſuch things are not only Juſtified, but truſted to for Juſtification, and made conſiſtent with a Church that <hi>never Erred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed theſe Errours crept in by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which maketh it difficult to Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Scripture Propheſie, to know juſt the year when the miſchief became ſo

ripe as to prove <hi>Rome</hi> to be <hi>Babylon</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to Pagano-Chriſtianity, and the Pope to be <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> But if I ſee a man Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging mad in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> I will not make it an Article of my Faith, that he is <hi>Sanae mentis,</hi> becauſe I know not juſt when his <hi>amentia &amp; deliratio,</hi> or Melancholly became a <hi>Mania,</hi> or <hi>Furor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Deceiver alſo citeth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe men muſt <hi>hear the Church,</hi> where a Sinner dwelleth, that calleth him to Repentance after due Proof and Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, therefore the Pope and his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates cannot Err. An Argument liker a Deriſion, than a ſerious Proof: Did not the Pope then Err, when Biſhops and Councils have in vain called him to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? Doth not the Church Err then moſt damnably, that commandeth Murder, Treaſon, and moſt heynous Sin, and is the Leader of the Impenitent? Muſt we take ſuch then as Heathens and Publicans? But as the <hi>man thinketh,</hi> ſo the <hi>Bell tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> Do but Fancy that by the [<hi>Church,</hi>] is meant only the Pope and his Clergy; and that all is ſuch Sin which the Pope calleth ſo, tho' God command us, and then all ſuch Texts will ſeem to them to ſay what they would have them ſay.</p>

                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:64665:32"/>The man alſo citeth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.27. <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt will preſent his Regenerate Church, perfect and ſpotleſs in Judgment.

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="3">3.

The Papiſts themſelves keep hidden Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, where they cannot have more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p n="5">5. But we cannot ſay, that yet the Church hath been ſo low ſince the days of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that all Princes have diſowned the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, and we hope it never will be ſo.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But <hi>all Ages</hi> and <hi>parts</hi> of the Church, have not been <hi>equally pure and ſound:</hi> In ſome Ages the <hi>Arrians</hi> were moſt: In the Reign of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> Junior, <hi>Anaſtaſius, &amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Eutichians</hi> prevailed: In the days of <hi>Philippicus</hi> the <hi>Monothelites</hi> prevailed, ſo that at one of their Councils <hi>Binius</hi> ſaith, <hi>There were Innumerable Biſhops</hi>: In one Emperours time thoſe prevailed that were againſt Images; in <hi>Irene's</hi> and <hi>Theodora</hi>'s

               <p>Now in all theſe Caſes, the <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>profeſſing Chriſtinanity, was ſtill Viſible:</hi> But which of all the parts was the <hi>pureſt and ſoundeſt,</hi> was known to none but the <hi>ſound parts</hi> themſelves. And when and where the Errours became ſo great as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to nullifie, or invalidate the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity this was known only to thoſe near, that had opportunity to know the mind of the accuſed: For <hi>Noxa Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put ſequitur</hi>: One man, tho' a Prince or Prelate, cannot make all his Subjects He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks by his Errour.</p>
               <p>So that nothing hath been more Viſible, than that there have ſtill been profeſſed Chriſtians, and ſo an Univerſal viſible Church on Earth.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64665:34"/>
to the Erroneous; (For no man knoweth that he Erreth;) but it hath been viſible to the Sound. And ſo, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> yet Profeſſeth Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we know: But whether their Errours prove them <hi>Babylon,</hi> or nullifie their Chriſtianity, muſt be known only by trying the guilty Individuals.</p>
               <p>Here the Cheaters ſay to the Ignorant, If <hi>the Church hath been always Viſible, where was your Church before Luther?</hi>

But whether Papiſts, <hi>Arrians, Eutychians, Neſtorians, Monothelites, Phantaſians,</hi> Image-Worſhippers, do invalidate their profeſſion of Chriſtianity, by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Errours and Crimes, it much more concerneth themſelves, than us to enquire and judge.</p>
               <p>But tho' thoſe that nullify not their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity, are all of the ſame Church Univerſal that we are of, yet we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that their <hi>New humane Church,</hi> which is [<hi>only the Pope as Head, and all that adhere to him as ſuch,</hi>] are no Church of Chriſt at all.

               <p>And now what an ignorant Cant is it to ſay, <hi>The Church cannot Apoſtatize</hi>; Ergo, <hi>it cannot Err</hi>; Ergo, <hi>the Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>and his hireling Clergy cannot Apoſtatize</hi>; and Ergo, <hi>They cannot Err!</hi> Tell me, whether <hi>Rome</hi> be all the World?

Reformed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks hold, that <hi>Peter</hi> is called <hi>firſt</hi> in numbring them: That he was by Chriſt in many inſtances, preferred before others: That he was an <hi>Eminent Speaker,</hi> and <hi>worker</hi> of <hi>Miracles</hi>: That all the Apoſtles were not <hi>Equal</hi> in <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>worth</hi>; but ſome herein <hi>greater</hi> than other. What, was <hi>Judas</hi> no leſſer than the reſt, that was a Thief and Traytor? <hi>John</hi> was Eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Diſciple whom Jeſus loved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:64665:37"/>But we hold, 1. That as <hi>John</hi> was not made Lord or Ruler of the reſt, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Loved more,</hi> ſo <hi>Peter's</hi> Preheminence made him no <hi>Maſter or Ruler</hi> of the reſt: The <hi>twelve Apoſtles</hi> were choſen Relative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the <hi>twelve Tribes. Peter</hi> as <hi>Reuben</hi> was the <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>denyed Chriſt,</hi> and was called <hi>Satan,</hi> with a <hi>Get behind me,</hi> (Mat. 16.) as <hi>Reuben</hi> defiled his Fathers Bed. But as <hi>Levi</hi> was the third, ſo was <hi>James</hi> the firſt <hi>Sanctified Apoſtle:</hi> And as <hi>Juda</hi> the fourth, is called the <hi>Law-giver,</hi> from <hi>whom the Scepter ſhould not depart, &amp;c.</hi> ſo <hi>John</hi> the fourth is the Diſciple of <hi>Eminent Love</hi>; and <hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>Everlaſting Grace,</hi> when Faith and Propheſie ceaſe. But Chriſt made no one of them Ruler of the reſt.</p>
               <p>Proved, 1. No Text ſpeaketh any ſuch thing: And the Headſhip of Governing Power, would have been of ſuch grand neceſſity to be known, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles muſt needs have plainly and oft inculcated it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Peter</hi> never <hi>Exerciſed</hi> any ſuch Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; what mention is there of any Laws or Mandates of his to the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The reſt never ſought to him for Laws or Orders.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="8">8. He never once claimed any ſuch Power.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. tells us of none in the Church greater than <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> But the reſt were Apoſtles as well as he.</p>
               <p n="10">10. No ſuch Article was ever put into the Churches Creed.</p>
               <p>We grant that Chriſt did in inſtituting the Apoſtles Office, inſtitute a diſparity of Miniſters in his Church, and this to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Ordinary continued part of their Works, but not in the Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. And we grant that in putting <hi>Peter</hi> firſt, Chriſt intimated, that among men of the ſame Office, there may for Order ſake be a Priority; as the Preſident of a Synod or Colledge, or the Fore-man of a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64665:38"/>
Jury, or a Chief-Juſtice, or the Speaker of a Parliament: God is not the God of Confuſion, but of Order, as in all the Churches: If a Pariſh or an Independant Church have one grave Paſtor, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers young Aſſiſtants, that were but his Scholars, nature will give him ſome awing Preheminence among them.

Or muſt the <hi>Clergy</hi> have no ſuch Government over them? Yes, <hi>the Pope,</hi> ſay the Papal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons; he is Sword-bearer over the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy: So you ſee what <hi>Church-power</hi> is come to.

O! how much worſe than Hangmen, would ſuch men make all Kings and Magiſtrates!</p>
               <p>Was not all the Chriſtian World in a ſad caſe then, when the Pope was under the <hi>Arrian Goths,</hi> and the Subject of a Foreign <hi>Arian</hi> muſt Rule all Kings and Kingdoms?</p>
               <p>No man of Brains can be ignorant that Popedom or Prelacy, do not always make men mortified Saints, (that oft have been ſcarce Men, much leſs Chriſtians;) nor that the Prince hath a great Power, both in <hi>Chooſing</hi> and <hi>Ruling</hi> the Clergy that are his Subjects.

and never boaſt that they have of their own a Redundancy to ſave others.

               <p n="1">1. No man can perform to God, more Duty than he oweth him: It's a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; Duty is <hi>quod debetur.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. There is no Moral good done by any man, which was not his Duty, and Gods Law commanded not: For Gods Law is perfect, and therefore obligeth to all Moral good: And as Sin is the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law, ſo Moral good is the conform Obedience to the Law.</p>

               <p n="6">6.

               </p>
               <p n="7">7.

               </p>
               <p>This not underſtood, maketh theſe Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> abuſe the words of Chriſt and <hi>Paul,</hi> about Chaſtity, and Marriage. And becauſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>every man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive this Saying,</hi> and <hi>Paul, ſhe hath not Sinned:</hi> He <hi>that Marrieth doth well,</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:64665:46"/>
and <hi>he that doth not, doth better</hi>; they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that there are <hi>Moral actions</hi> which are <hi>not beſt,</hi> and yet <hi>no Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The true plain ſolution is from the two laſt Conſiderations. 1. God hath made no Law commanding or forbidding <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> or <hi>Celibate as ſuch,</hi> or <hi>in Common.</hi> To Marry is no Sin, conſidered meerly as Marriage. 2. But God hath made Laws againſt <hi>hurtful</hi> and <hi>injurious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,</hi> and to guide men to know, when Marrying is a Duty or a Sin. 3. And if any ones caſe were ſo neutral, as that it could not be diſcerned, whether Marrying were a hurt or benefit, it would be no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, eligible or refuſeable action. 4. But to ſome it is a <hi>great Duty</hi> by <hi>accidents,</hi> and to ſome a <hi>great Sin.</hi> Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> never meant that it was <hi>no mans duty,</hi> and <hi>no mans ſin,</hi> but only that <hi>ſimply as Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> it <hi>was no mans duty</hi> or <hi>ſin,</hi> or the matter of a <hi>commanding</hi> or <hi>forbidding Law,</hi> but only by <hi>accident,</hi> it may be ſuch to one more than to another.</p>
               <p>That this is <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, the Papiſts muſt confeſs. For 1. Do not they ſay that the Marriage of Prieſts, Fryars and Nuns are Sin? 2. If any one Marry an Infidel, or utterly unſuitable Perſon, without neceſſity, againſt Parents wills,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64665:47"/>
or one that is impotent, or hath the Pox, or that he cannot maintain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>? Is not this a hainous Sin? What elſe ſignifie Gods Law, and mans, againſt unlawful Marriages.</p>
               <p>And if one cannot live chaſtly without Marriage, and Parents command it, it is not a Sin to refuſe? The Law ſaith, <hi>Let all things be done to Edification, and whether ye Eat or Drink, or whatever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> And is it only Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and no Command, to Marry or not Marry, as it makes to Gods Glory or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it? There are few actions of a mans Life, that make ſo much to his hurt, and utter miſery, as unwiſe and unmeet Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying. And is this on Sin? May they not ſee <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning then, if they were but willing? It is hard to imagine a caſe in which ſo important an action as Marriage, can be neither Sin nor Duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſometime men uſe the word [<hi>Sin,</hi>] and [<hi>Sinners,</hi>] for meer Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and ſuch Sin as is inconſiſtent with a ſtate of Salvation. And we eaſily grant, that all Sins are not ſuch Sins as theſe; But Gods Law is perfect, tho' man be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and forbiddeth all Sin, even the leaſt.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:64665:47"/>3. But ſee the Hereſies of Popery? This man here ſaith, [To <hi>do that which is Counſelled, is not neceſſary, becauſe one may nevertheleſs be ſaved: But he who omitteth what is commanded, (unleſs he do pennance,) cannot eſcape Eternal pains.</hi>]</p>
               <p n="1">1. See here what a frivolous Counſeller they make Chriſt, when it's not neceſſary to follow his Counſel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. See here how they make <hi>Neceſſity</hi> to be only of that which a man cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without: When <hi>Saul</hi> a Perſecutor, and Blaſphemer, an Infidel, Murderer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be ſaved, if he be truly Convicted: <hi>Obedience</hi> hath it's <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> tho' we knew that God would forgive Diſobedience, to the Convicted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. See here how <hi>they damn themſelves and all mankind,</hi> every man living <hi>omitteth what is commanded</hi> many hundred times, for which he doth not that which they call Pennance. He is a Lyar, <hi>that ſaith he hath no Sin,</hi> ſpecially of Omiſſion. Gods Law bindeth us all to Believe, to Hope, to deſire Holineſs and Heaven, to love God and our Neighbours, and our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, with a ſtronger degree of Faith, Hope, Deſire, and Love, than we do: Every Prayer, and Meditation is ſinfully defective: Every hour hath ſome omiſſion
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64665:48"/>
of improvement: And all this is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, nor all confeſt to a Prieſt, nor all known or obſerved by any Sinner: And ſome omiſſion we are guilty of at our very Death, by gradual defect of Faith, Hope, Patience, Love, Content, and Joy. And muſt all theſe go to Hell?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Seeing by <hi>Penance</hi> they mean not bare Repentance, but making God ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by a task, of Penalty laid on them by a Prieſt, ye ſee how they damn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, would be the Maſters of all others Salvation, by their Pennances.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But it's like that Purgatory is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by them in <hi>Pennances</hi>; or elſe no man ſhould go to Purgatory, but all to Hell: For all have many omiſſions of commanded Duty, which they did no Pennance for in this Life.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But you ſee of how little value they judge Chriſts Sacrifice and Merit, that pardoneth no omiſſion of a <hi>duty without Pennance, and Satisfaction truly.</hi>

He tells you not, that this is as much a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie among themſelves, as with the Proreſtants. He tells you not, how <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> and <hi>Palagius</hi> managed it, and that their Pope <hi>Celeſtine</hi> took <hi>Auguſtines</hi> part: He tells you not, that the <hi>Thomiſts, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans, Oratorians,</hi> and moſt <hi>Nominals,</hi> and <hi>Scotiſts,</hi> ſay as much againſt Free-will as we do, and we as much for it as they. He ſuppoſeth that you never read what <hi>Lombaerd, Aquinas, Bradwardine, Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, Ferrarienſis, Zumel, Bannez, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez, Aegedius Romi, Capreolus,</hi> and a Multitude more, ſay as much, and many more, againſt Free-will, than the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants: He tells you, not that even the Learned <hi>Jeſuits, Suarez, Vaſquez, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> with <hi>Penottus,</hi> and many ſuch, are as much againſt Free-will, as moſt Learned Proteſtants. The man takes you for a Herd of ſilly Animals, that know not but that he ſaith true, what falſhood
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64665:49"/>
ſoever he ſhall tell you: But the truth of the Controverſie is this:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Proteſtants loath ſo ſilly a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Controverſies, as this chat of <hi>Free-will</hi> without diſtinction: And ſo of <hi>Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They know that <hi>Phyſical, Moral,</hi> and <hi>Political Freedom</hi> of will, are not all one thing. <hi>Phyſical Freedom</hi> or Power, is that by which the <hi>natural</hi> faculty of the will, can <hi>determine it ſelf</hi> to act, (not without a ſuperiour Cauſe, but) without any extrinſick or intrinſick <hi>Coactor,</hi> or <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitating cauſe of Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moral Freedom</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> is that by which the will is from under the overſtrong Byas of a <hi>vicious Diſpoſition,</hi> or <hi>deceitful Argument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Political Freedom</hi> is, when no Law of God or Man obligeth him to any Evil, but all to good.</p>
               <p>Protheſtants hold, 1. That <hi>Phyſical Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> is common to man, as man. That is, that he wants not <hi>natural faculties</hi> to chooſe aright, but a <hi>right Inclination</hi>: And that he ſinneth not for want of ſuch <hi>faculties,</hi> but for want of their right diſpoſition and action.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That all men have juſt ſo much, and no more <hi>Moral Liberty and power,</hi> as they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64665:49"/>
have of <hi>Gods Grace,</hi> to Relieve their viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated wills and diſpoſitions, and to help them in the act. No man is freed from <hi>vitious Inclinations,</hi> further than <hi>Gods Grace freeth him,</hi> which is much more where there is <hi>ſpecial Grace</hi> and <hi>ſtrong,</hi> than where there is but <hi>common Grace</hi> or <hi>weak.</hi> And that the <hi>Thraldom</hi> or <hi>Impotency</hi> of the Vitious, is but the <hi>diſeaſe</hi> of their <hi>wills,</hi> and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Sin: <hi>e. g.</hi> Where the Drunkard or Fornicator ſaith, <hi>I cannot forbear my Sin:</hi> He is ſo much the worſe and more unexcuſeable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Every man hath not only <hi>Political Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> to avoid Sin, but much more, even Gods urgent Precepts, Promiſes, and Threats: God doth not only give <hi>us Leave,</hi> but <hi>commandeth us</hi> not to Sin.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Libertas hominis,</hi> when a man may <hi>have</hi> what he <hi>chooſeth,</hi> is more than <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertas Voluntatis,</hi> which is but the <hi>Mode</hi> of it's ſelf <hi>determination</hi>; as without <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint</hi>

               <p>If a man indeed diſable himſelf, as put out his Eyes that he may not read, or cut out his Tongue that he may not Preach; the diſabling act is vitiouſly aggravated, from all the good to which he diſabled himſelf, as if it ſtill had been his Duty: But we cannot ſay that God ſtill command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him when Blind to Read, or when Dumb to Speak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Indeed God chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

               <p n="6">6. In what Sence ſhall ſuch ſay the Lords Prayer, <hi>Forgive us our Sins</hi> or Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes?</p>

               <p>But it's like he will ſay that he did not mean, that any <hi>man doth keep</hi> all <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> but that he <hi>can do it,</hi> tho' he do not. <hi>Anſ.</hi> I again ſay, 1.

               </p>
               <p>But perhaps he meant not that it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to keep all the Commands, for all <hi>our Lives,</hi> but for <hi>ſome ſhort time?</hi> I anſwer, 1.

               <p>But perhaps he ſpeaketh but of <hi>ſincere Obedience,</hi> and not of <hi>abſolute</hi> ſinleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. <hi>Anſ.</hi> If ſo, he is a deceiver to feign that we deny it: But their Doctrine of Perfection and Supererogation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Many wordy Controverſies are made about things, that in Sence men are commonly agreed in. 1. We all believe Gods Word, that they were deceived that thought they could be juſtified either by the Law of Innocency or Nature, or the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or any meritorious Works of their own, without, or as a ſupplement to the Sacrifice, Merits and free Grace of Chriſt our Saviour, and Faith in him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By Faith is meant <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> In the Goſpel it is all one to be a <hi>Believer,</hi> a <hi>Diſciple</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and to be a <hi>Christian.</hi> The Chriſtian Faith is that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in the Baptiſmal Covenant, believing in and giving up our ſelves to, God the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64665:54"/>
Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: To Chriſt as our Prophet, Prieſt and King, to be ſaved by his Merits and free Grace: And this is put in oppoſition to the Works of <hi>Adam's</hi> or <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, or any other that are conceited to ſuffice and merit, without the foreſaid Redemption by Chriſt. And is not this the true Doctrine of all true Chriſtians?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe good Works that are our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Law of Chriſt, are but the performance of our Baptiſmal Covenant, and the Fruits of Faith, without which it is dead Hypocriſie, and are of abſolute neceſſity to Salvation, to all that have time to do them.</p>
               <p>Againſt the charge, That we are Sinners deſerving Hell, we are juſtified by Chriſt believed in: Againſt the accuſation, That we are Infidels, Ungodly, Hypocrites, we muſt be juſtified by our Faith, Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Works, or periſh.</p>
               <p>But we do alſo hold, 1. That if a man be convicted, as the Theif on the Croſs, and ſhould die ſuddenly, no outward good which he cannot do, is abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Salvation, but only his inward Faith, Love, and Repentance, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion if able.</p>

               <p n="1">1. None of them dare ſay, that men are Damned or Saved without Gods fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, nor againſt his abſolute will, by overcoming his Power.</p>

               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="6">6.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64665:57"/>
Corn, though they neither Plow nor Sow, but that they ſhall Eat and Drink, and live thereby; and that they ſhall Plow and Sow, and mannure the Soil, and ſo have Corn.
<q>So God doth at once decree, [that this and that man ſhall have the means of Grace, (eſpecially a Saviour and the Goſpel,) and ſhall faithfully uſe them, and be Sanctified by them, and ſincerely obey God, and overcome the World, the Fleſh and the Devil, and perſevere to the End, and that for Chriſts Merits he will give them the Grace of his Spirit, and pardon their Sins, and bring them to Glory.]</q> All this is our Decree of God.</p>
               <p>But he doth not decree that men ſhall ſin, that they may be Damned: For ſin is no Work of God, nor a means appointed by him for Men's Damnation, no more than a Righteous King doth make men Traytors or Murderers, that he may Hang them. But he juſtly denyeth his Grace to many that forfeit it by willful Reſiſtance, Diſobedience, and Contempt; though he take not the forfeiture of his Elect.</p>
               <p>He is deceived and wrongeth God that maketh him the Author of Men's ſin: And ſo doth he that feigneth God to ſend his Son to redeem the World, and his Word

unacquainted with them. And thoſe Angels that rejoyce at a Sinners Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, are not unacquainted with it.</p>
               <p>And as to their Praying, we know not how it is that Angels expreſs their deſires to God; but we all agree that they deſire our welfare, and therefore may be ſaid to pray for it, if all notified Deſire be Prayer.

But we pray not to dead Saints nor Angels: 1. Becauſe we have an hundred Commands to pray to God, and not one to pray to them, and where there is no Law, there is no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion or Sin. Therefore while we are ſure it is no Sin to forbear it, and know not but it is Sin to do it, we go the ſafe way: If they ſay, it is againſt the Popes Law or his Clergy's, we ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> it is a ſmall thing to us to be judged of man, (who can but kill our Bodies,) we have one that judgeth us, even the Lord. Let the Pope Damn us if he can.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the firſt Commandment forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us to have any God but one, ſo the

ſecond forbiddeth us to worſhip ſo as the Heathens did their Idols, becauſe it is Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily interpretative Idolatry and Scandal: But the Heathens uſed to pray to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Deities, whom they judged to be much like that which the Papiſts judge of Angels, and praying to Inviſible Spirits is to imitate them as ſcandalouſly as praying toward Images: No wonder therefore that you ſo uſually leave out the ſecond Commandment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Gods Word is the Rule of all accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Religious Worſhip, (tho' but a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule in many Modes and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,) and therefore we fear ſwerving from it.</p>

to fall down and worſhip him.</hi> Therefore we had rather hearken to the Angels than to Devils: And fear, they that do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, worſhip Devils for Angels, becauſe <hi>only Devils</hi> have ſought ſuch Worſhip. And the Devil oft turneth himſelf as into an Angel of Light to deceive, as his Miniſters do into Miniſters of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

It is enough for us to believe, that after the true Conſecration, it is no more <hi>meer Bread and Wine,</hi> (as after the Coyning a 20 <hi>s.</hi> Piece, a Crown, or a Noble, or an Angel, it is not <hi>meer Gold,</hi> but the ſaid na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Coyn.)

This adjuncts and effects will ſhew the difference between this Counterfeit Sacrament and Chriſt.

like the Knave in <hi>Ignoramus</hi>'s Play, that Proclaimed the man to be Mad, from whom he intended to extort Money, that is, for binding and abuſing him. What is it to proclaim Chriſt and <hi>Paul</hi> to be Fools, that could not ſpeak Senſe, if this be not?</p>
               <p>But the Doctors have alſo contradictions to charge on Chriſt, even that elſe-where he ſaith, [<hi>He that eateth his Fleſh ſhall live for ever:</hi>] <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That is, <hi>He that truſteth in a Sacrificed Chriſt as the means of his Salvation, as bread</hi> is the <hi>means</hi> of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Life:</hi> He that would not underſtand, cannot underſtand the plaineſt Words: But doth Chriſt ſay, that <hi>any man eateth his fleſh, that drinketh not his blood?</hi> Or that he ſhall have <hi>Life, that doth the one without the other?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And ſeeing they take every Rogue that eateth their Wafer to eat Chriſts Fleſh, do they not here falſly ſay that all ſuch ſhall have Eternal Life: O happy (miſerable) Church, that hath Eternal Life, how wicked ſoever, for eating the Wafer, and calling it Chriſts Fleſh! And all this, that <hi>Faith</hi> may not be thought to be meant by eating.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But ſeeing it muſt needs be eating by the Teeth, or by Fleſh eating that is meant, they have found out a crafty literal way:
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64665:76"/>
Chriſt ſaith that <hi>he loveth and cheriſheth his Church as his own Fleſh, and we are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones:</hi> And ſo they that Murdered a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of the <hi>Albigenſes, &amp;c.</hi> and Maſſacred 40000 in <hi>France,</hi> and 200000 in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Burnt them in <hi>England, Germany,</hi> the Low Countries, and Tormented and Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and many other Lands, did learn the <hi>literal way of eating Chriſts Fleſh.</hi> And who doubts but the Devil tells them that they ſhall <hi>thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain everlaſting Life?</hi> But why then are they <hi>againſt drinking his blood,</hi> when actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they draw it out by ſtreams?

               <p n="3">3. And what but flat oppoſition to Chriſt, ſhould move theſe men to forbid one half of his Sacrament, which he calls the <hi>New-Teſtament in his blood?</hi> One would wonder what ſhould be their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: It is no matter of Pleaſure, Profit, or Honour: This very Deceiver had more
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64665:77"/>
wit than to pretend Antiquity for it, or any one ancient Doctor of the Church. They dare not deny (ſave to Ignorants and Fools,) that it is a Novelty contrary to unqueſtioned Conſent and Practice of all Chriſts Church, for above a thouſand years, or near at leaſt. It is undenyably againſt <hi>Chriſts Inſtitution and Command, againſt his Apoſtles Doctrine, and Scripture Practice</hi>; againſt all the Judgment and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the ancient Church, againſt the Nature and Integrity of the Sacrament, againſt the Concord of the Church, that will never Unite againſt all theſe, againſt the Senſe and Comfort of Believers. What then doth over-rule ſo many men to Tear the Church, to Murder ſo many <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians</hi> as they did, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for ſuch a thing as this is? Reader I will tell thee all that I know: The Devil is in conſtant War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt and his Kingdom, and the Souls of men: As he thought he could have triumphed in making <hi>Job</hi> curſe God to his Face; ſo he would fain ſhew that he can make Chriſts own pretended Miniſters oppoſe and deſpiſe the plaineſt of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and defie his Word and him to his Face.

whoſe very hearts are againſt the Laws of Chriſt: And puffing up theſe men by degrees, he tells them how they muſt be Great, and arrogate Power equal to Chriſts Apoſtles, and ſo domineer over the Souls of men; and all this on pretence of honouring Chriſt: And having gotten a Generation of groſs ignorant debauched Villains, into the Papal elevated Seat, and the Ruling Church Power, when ſome poor Woman once or twice ſhed ſome of the Wine, or a Prieſt chanced to ſpill it, their prophane Holineſs decreed that they ſhould drink the Wine no more (ſave the Clergy,) but ſhould eat Chriſts Blood, which they ſaid was in his Fleſh, and a while they dipt the Wafer in Wine; and then pretended Infallibility being their vain Glory, they muſt not change leſt they ſhould ſeem to be fallible, and ſhould Repent; for Repenting undoes Satans Kingdom.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:64665:78"/>Among Heathens and <hi>Jews,</hi> there were various ſorts of <hi>Sacrifices:</hi> Some Hilaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, ſome Euchariſtical: Some of things Lifeleſs, and ſome of Living Creatures; where ſtrictly <hi>part was burnt</hi> and ſo <hi>offered</hi> to God, and part given to the Prieſt, and part eaten by the Offerers.</p>
               <p>We hold, 1. That Jeſus Chriſt offered his Body on the Croſs a Sacrifice to God for the expiation of Sin, as a thing pleaſing to God, in a ſence which no other Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>was or is; not that God delighted in his Blood, Pain or Death as ſuch; but as <hi>finis gratiâ,</hi> it was the moſt excellent means to demonſtrate his Wiſdom, Love, Juſtice, and Mercy, and ſave a ſinful race of men, with the honour of his Law and Government.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We hold that Chriſt hath inſtituted his Sacrament, to be a viſible <hi>Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of this his Sacrifice, both for <hi>Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration</hi> and for <hi>actual Inveſtiture</hi> and <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> of Chriſt to be our Saviour, and Head in Union, and of his Grace and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, Pardon, Reconciliation, Adoption, Juſtification, Sanctification, and Title to Glory. And we know that the ancient Churches called this often <hi>a Sacrifice:</hi> Not in the ſame ſence as Chriſt was our Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; nor as the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Types were <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi>;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64665:79"/>
but a <hi>Repreſentative Sacrifice,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting Chriſts own. But we are the ſhier to uſe the name Sacrifice, where Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts apply it to Idolatry.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We know that all Chriſtians are bound to dedicate themſelves to God, and even to lay down their Lives when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it; and bound to offer him peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Confeſſion, Praiſe, Thanksgiving, and to give Alms to the poor, and ſerve and honour him with all their Wealth and Power. And all theſe are called <hi>Sacrifices</hi> in Scripture, becauſe they are <hi>ſacred ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, acceptable to God through the merits of Chriſts Sacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is not this man a Calumniator then, that faith we hold, [<hi>that there is not in the Church a true</hi> and proper Sacrifice,] unleſs he call none true and proper but what no man can offer to God.</p>
               <p>But what ſay we to the <hi>Sacrifice of the Maſs?</hi> We ſay, that for the Prieſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that after his words, Bread is turned into Chriſts Fleſh in a Phyſical ſence, and Wine into his Blood, and that this is our God, and that he ſacrificeth this God to God, and eateth and drinketh him ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, and that all that ſo receive him have Eternal Life: This is a prophanation of Holy things, a deceiving of Souls, a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64665:79"/>
blaſpheming of Chriſt, and Idolatry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. And all ſacrificing in their Maſs, that is more than a <hi>Repreſentation of Chriſts own ſacrificing himſelf, for Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration and Communication of the gifts of his Teſtament, and the expreſſion of our Gratitude, and Devotedneſs to God by him,</hi> is their own prophane invention.</p>
               <p>How do they offer his broken body and blood ſhed, any otherwiſe than <hi>Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> unleſs they kill him, and eat him when he is Dead? It was only a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of his own <hi>ſacrificed</hi> Body and Blood, which he made at the Sacrament himſelf; not then broken and ſhed, but to be broken, ſlain, and ſhed ſoon after, (unleſs he had two bodies, one dead and one alive.) The Sacrament indeed was called a Sacrifice by the ancient Churches, to ſignifie that it is not Chriſts body as <hi>now glorified in Heaven</hi> that is there <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, but his body as once fleſh and blood ſacrificed on the Croſs:</hi> And how can it be that, but by <hi>Repreſentation, ſacrificing</hi> it was <hi>killing it:</hi> Do they kill Chriſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thouſand times over, yea, and kill his <hi>Gloryfied body?</hi> He hath no exiſtent Fleſh and Blood in Heaven, ſpeaking pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and formally; but a <hi>Spiritual glorified body,</hi> that was Fleſh and Blood on Earth:
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64665:80"/>
And doth every Prieſt turn Chriſts Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual glorified body into Fleſh and Blood again? O what a Maſs of prophanation is their Maſs.</p>

               <p>Therefore, if Boys or Girls Vow Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, and it prove thar they cannot keep it without ſin, the Matter becometh to them unlawful, and they muſt break it: As for inſtance: 1.

keep it, the Kingdom or Church is like to ſuffer by it. 3. If Parents or Prince countermand the Vow in Youth.</p>

What is Phyſick, Aſtronomy, Geography, but the ſhell of knowing and honouring Gods Works, and God in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And the Image of Kings, of Holy Men, are purpoſely made and Printed by Proteſtants, in Love, Honour, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the perſons Living or Dead, whom they repreſent: You may ſee many Rooms adorned with the Images of the Fathers, and of late Divines: For their <hi>Relation</hi> they love with ſome ſort of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Pictures of thoſe whom you have burnt as Hereticks: See whether you find them not in <hi>John Fox</hi> his Acts and Monuments.</p>

               <p>And we abhor the Papiſts Omiſſion of the ſecond Commandment, and turning the Tenth into two, leſt the people ſhould perceive the evil of ſuch Imagery.

               <p n="4">4. And to pray before the Image of Saints, and then to ſay, <hi>we do not pray to them , but to thoſe that they repreſent,</hi> is but to do what the Heathen Idolaters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to do to their Demons: They uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſaid, We be not ſuch Fools as to think Wood, and Stone, and Gold, and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,

               <p>But publick worſhip requireth a conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Soul and Service, and therefore a conjunct underſtanding: Elſe there is no true Union and Communion in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. For one ſound of words with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of deſires, is no Chriſtian Union and Communion. It muſt be ſuppoſed that either the Hearers are not praying at all,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64665:95"/>
or elſe that every one is ſecretly praying after his own thoughts for various things, without any Concord.</p>
               <p>What melody would it be for all the Church to ſing in as many Tunes as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? What King or Judge will take it for a Petition, for a man to talk-gibberiſh to him, or ſay he knoweth not what?</p>
               <p n="10">10. Even Papiſts deride Quakers, for meeting to ſay nothing: And what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is there, when they hear and ſay nothing underſtood, ſaving that the Voice maketh it a more pompous Mockery, than the Quakers Silence? O! who would have thought that the primitive manner of publick worſhip, ſhould ever have dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated into ſuch a prophane abuſe of God and man, againſt plain Scripture, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal practice, and humane Reaſon? And this as a part of a grand deſign to kill the Life of all true Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and delude Souls with the dead Carkaſs of mortified For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, and Ceremonies; and that men ſhould think that Souls are ſaved as Wiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards do pretend, to do Cures by <hi>Charms</hi> of words not underſtood; they ſerve God with empty ſhells, when they have caſt away the Kernels: Like the ſilly <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Woman, that lookt for a Chriſt to come to tell them, <hi>whether in this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:64665:96"/>
or at <hi>Jeruſalem men ought to worſhip,</hi> little knowing what it was to worſhip God as a Spirit, in Spirit and Truth, when it ſhould be neither at that Mountain, or at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But hath this man no Scripture, (againſt Scripture?) Yes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.8. [<hi>The people were praying without, while the Prieſt was offering Incenſe within.</hi>] Therefore the publick Worſhip may be performed, ſo as the people underſtand not: That, 1. The Prieſts action only out of their ſight is the publick worſhip, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples praying is not ſo. 2. The offering <hi>Incenſe,</hi> is Praying; or becauſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not to do the Prieſts Office in Incenſe and Sacrificing, therefore Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters muſt pray and praiſe God alone, without the people, and all this publick worſhip. 3. If the Levitical, Sacrifices were offered by the Prieſt alone, Chriſts Goſpel worſhip muſt be performed by the Prieſt alone, the people not knowing what he ſaith: And the precepts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the New-Teſtament, muſt all be reduced to the Levitical Order of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe and Sacrificing. 4. And is he ſure that all the people in the outer Court, prayed they knew not what, or in an unknown Tongue? What uſe is Scripture of to theſe men?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:64665:96"/>His next is, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.17. <hi>None was to go in with the Prieſt to make attonement for the Congregation, &amp;c. Anſ.</hi> You ſee that theſe men are Judaizers, and ſet up the Levitical Law for the Churches Rule of Service, as if Chriſt had not changed the Law. But our Queſtion is not now, Whether their Prieſt have any ſolitary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement to make for the Congregation; but whether Chriſt hath not inſtituted ſuch publick worſhip, in which Miniſters and people muſt underſtandingly joyn? Doth their Prieſt celebrate their Maſs alone, out of the peoples ſight or hearing, in a Sanctuary while they are in the outer Court? Do not their people aſſemble to their Maſs? Will they ſtand to it, that their Church renounceth all worſhip of God in Holy Aſſemblies, ſave by the Prieſt alone? And is this the Holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church?</p>
               <p>And the man here profeſſedly calls the <hi>Prieſts ſolitary action, the publick Service, which is for the people, and not by them, and therefore they need not underſtand</hi>; and all the peoples Prayers are <hi>private and ſhould be underſtood</hi>; ſo that (the Myſtery ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,) either the <hi>Prieſt is all the Church,</hi> or elſe they have <hi>no publick Church Service,</hi> if they muſt meet, that every one may
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64665:97"/>
have a ſecret Prayer of his own, and may only <hi>ſee</hi> the Prieſts Service called pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. And by this he pretends that he anſwereth <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. Adding moſt ſhameleſly, 1. That it ſeemeth there by the Text, that the common Service of the Church, was not then in a Tongue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly underſtood. 2. Becauſe there was one to <hi>ſupply</hi> the <hi>place</hi> of the Ideots, to ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> where he ſaith, that the <hi>Geneva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, moſt deceitfully</hi> and <hi>maliciouſly</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, [<hi>He that is an Ideot, how ſhall he ſay Amen?</hi>] And raileth at them for putting [<hi>So be it.</hi>] O! what is man, and how incredible is the pretended infallible Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, that can expect that all men truſt their Souls on ſuch palpable deceit! When St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpent a great part of the Chapter to diſſwade thoſe that by Inſpiration, could ſpeak ſtrange Languages, that they ſhould not uſe them in the Church, as being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifying, or at leaſt not without an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter; this man gathers, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Service was in an unknown Tongue? As if this diſſwaded uſe of ſome Prophets gift, were the common Service. 2. And when he diſſwadeth them from Praying in an unknown Tongue, or giving thanks in it, ſaying, <hi>elſe how can he that occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Room of the unlearned ſay Amen,</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:64665:97"/>
this man feigneth, that yet they were to give <hi>thanks in an unknown Tongue,</hi> and one was to <hi>ſupply</hi> the <hi>place</hi> of the <hi>Ideot</hi> or unlearned, in ſaying <hi>Amen,</hi> (See verſ. 23.) <hi>Paul</hi> would have all ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> this man ſays <hi>one was to do it for them: Paul</hi> argueth that therefore they muſt ſpeak to the underſtanding of the unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: This man turneth his own words againſt him: Doth his <hi>Supplier</hi> of the <hi>Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots</hi> place himſelf, underſtand or not? If not, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, How can he ſay <hi>Amen</hi>? If he do, how doth he ſupply the place of the Ideots, that are ſuppoſed ſhould ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> and cannot?</p>
               <p>For the ſake of this Chapter and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, I ſhall never think any words ſo plain, that Papiſts cannot turn againſt their moſt evident ſenſe.</p>
               <p>But what is the Man's pretence for this erroneous Confidence?

               <p>And what meaneth the man to rail at them, that ſay <hi>So be it,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Amen?</hi> Is it not a true Tranſlation?
