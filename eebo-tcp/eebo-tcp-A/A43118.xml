            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Bookseller will needs have a Preface to encourage the Sale of the Book. Now, for my part, I think there needs no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation than its Title; for thoſe that will not be induced to buy it, becauſe 'tis <hi>French,</hi> will not fail to have it for the ſake of its <hi>Politick's;</hi> yet, if any ſhould ſcruple laying out their Money only on the Credit of the Title Page, their Scruple (I doubt not) will be removed, when they are told that the Author of the <hi>Growth of Popery,</hi> ſays; That this Book is the meaſure of the <hi>French</hi> Kings Deſigns, and I'm ſure there's none of us all that will be-grudge <hi>Two Shillings</hi> to be made Privy to his Councels. But if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe things, nor the Credit it had in its Native Language, will cauſe the Book to Sell, I cann't imagine how a Preface ſhould do it; for I know few (if any) that read the Preface of a Book they intend not to Read alſo; I have known ſome, indeed, Read the Book, and omit the Preface, which I doubt would be the Fate of this, ſhould I make it long, I ſhall therefore only tell you how this Scheme of the vaſt Deſigns of the <hi>French</hi> King
<pb facs="tcp:109071:5"/>
became Publick, and ſo conclude. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was a Perſon bred up under <hi>Mr. Colebert,</hi> and to ſhew his Abilities, he writ this Treatiſe, and in Manuſcript preſented it to the <hi>French</hi> King, which was favourably received; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, Vanity prompting him to Publiſh it in Print, the King lookt upon him as one that had diſcovered his Secrets, and turned his Favour into Frowns, cauſed him to be impriſoned in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> where he continued a long time, and was not deliver'd thence, but to Baniſhment, which, to thoſe that read the Preface, affords one Encouragement more to Read the Book, ſince it diſcovers a Secret which moſt Men ſeek more after, and delight more in than Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Truth.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>1. What the Politicks are. 2. What their Object, End, and Means. 3. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſorts of Governments. 4. That Monarchy is the beſt.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Politicks are the Art of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning States. The Ancients have call'd 'em a Royal and a moſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Science, ſurpaſſing in excellency, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to all others. They have allow'd them the ſame precedence in practical
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109071:6"/>
Learning, which the Metaphyſicks and The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie, have among the Speculative.</p>
                     <p>The means which the Politicks preſcribe, are compriſed under the heads of an exact Obſervance of Religion, a doing Juſtice in all caſes; a providing that the People be protected in the times of Peace and War; and a preſerving the State in a juſt and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable mediocrity, by exterminating the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes of Poverty and of Riches.</p>
                     <p>The Politicks have three principal bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: Namely, the three ſorts of regular Governments, in which Men live under the Authority of Laws.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is Monarchy, in which one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prince doth command for the Publick good.</p>
                     <p>The Second is Ariſtocracy; in which the honeſteſt and wiſeſt Perſons, being elected out of all the Subjects, have the Direction and Adminiſtration of Publick Affairs.</p>
                     <p>The Third is Democracy, in which all Deliberations and Orders are held, and do paſs by the Agency and Vote of the People.</p>
                     <p>The principal end to which a Democracy tendeth, is Liberty. That of an Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is Riches and Virtue. The end of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, is, the Glory, the Virtue, the Riches, and the Liberty of the Country.</p>
                     <p>A Tyranny, the moſt dangerous of all vicious and unlawful Governments, ſtands in direct oppoſition unto Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>A Tyrant commandeth meerly for his own Perſonal, not the Publick Profit: A King does the contrary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:109071:6"/>Tyranny is deſtructive to the Glory, the Virtue, the Riches, and the Liberty of the People.</p>
                     <p>An Ariſtocracy often falls into an Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; and this happens when a determinate number of perſons is no longer choſen out of the whole to Govern, and the choice is made of the Rich and Noble only; not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally out of all the Citizens.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes there riſeth up Oligarchy, even within Oligarchy; and this comes to paſs, when the Magiſtrates are choſen of the Nobleſt and Richeſt of ſome preferred Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, not of all the rich Gentry.</p>
                     <p>An Ariſtocracy is in ſome ſort an Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, but much better than that which is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſuch: Foraſmuch as in an Ariſtocracy, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is adminiſtred to perſons of all ranks, according to deſert; which in an Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chique State is not done.</p>
                     <p>A well-temper'd Ariſtocracy is of long duration, and ſeldom comes into the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſuffering any Change.</p>
                     <p>An Oligarchy, on the contrary, ſuch as was the Government of the <hi>Decem-viri,</hi> or Ten, at <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Thirty at <hi>Athens,</hi> is eaſily corrupted. For the perſons who are in command, do frequently uſurp a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Authority. Such Uſurpation is not ſtiled a Tyranny; (for this is of one alone) but ſtrictly a Dynaſtie; that is, a Potentacy or Power, violently aſſumed and retained, contrary to the diſpoſition of the Laws. The <hi>Greeks</hi> (whoſe the word Dynaſtie is,)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109071:7"/>
do take it in this caſe, in an ill ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>An Ariſtocracy and an Oligarchy are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, when ſome one among the Rich, the Noble, or the Brave, does attain to an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown height. Thus <hi>Caeſar</hi> became Maſter of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Ariſtocracy is alſo in danger, when they that Govern, come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt with the multitude, or are hated by them, ſo that the inferiors grow facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and mutiny againſt them, as hapned at <hi>Rome,</hi> when the Tribunes of the People were firſt created.</p>
                     <p>The apprehenſions which the more than ordinary virtue of ſome excellent perſons, gave the People of <hi>Greece,</hi> cauſed the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of Oſtraciſme among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and of Petaliſme at <hi>Syracuſe:</hi> Puniſhments, but glorious for ſuch as were condemn'd to them.</p>
                     <p>A Democracy likewiſe, ſometimes, turns into an Oligarchy. And that is, when the dregs of the ignorant people, ſeduced by evil Orators, (whom the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,</hi> or, <hi>Leaders of the People</hi>) do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Affairs tumultuouſly, with uproar and violence, without reſpect to Law or Equity. Thus the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſeduced by their ſpeakers, did put to death <hi>Ariſtogenes,</hi> and other Captains who had fought in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with <hi>Thraſibulus,</hi> and gain'd a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Victory upon the <hi>Lacedomonians,</hi> their enemies.</p>
                     <p>Obligarchies are the means ſometimes that People loſe their liberty: and fall into ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude. <hi>Piſiſtratius</hi> became Tyrant of <hi>Athens</hi>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:109071:7"/>
that way, and <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of the <hi>Syracuſians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are as various Monarchies, Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracies, and Democracies, as there are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manners of men. But I have diſcours'd all this only curſorily; and I deſign not any further to engage my ſelf in theſe matters, my purpoſe being to ſpeak preciſely of the concerns of the French Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>There are two ſorts of Monarchy, unto which all Regal Governments, of whatever quality imaginable, are reduced; whether Elective, Hereditary, Barbarous, Deſpoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or any other.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe is entituled, The <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian;</hi> in which the King hath but a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Authority. The ſecond <hi>Aeconomical;</hi> in which the King hath a Sovereign and Abſolute power in his Kingdom, as the Father of a Family hath in his houſe.</p>
                     <p>'Tis no longer a queſtion, Whether Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy be the beſt Government, the caſe having been often debated by Politicians, and ſtill decided for Regality. And indeed it is of greateſt Antiquity, leaſt ſuſceptible of change; moſt conform unto the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of GOD himſelf; and not only repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the Authority which a Father exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his houſe, but it alſo neceſſarily oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs in an Ariſtocracy, and in Democracy it ſelf. For, both in the one and the other of theſe States, the Sovereignty is entirely one; ſo that no ſingle perſon can poſſeſs any the leaſt parcel of it. In an Ariſtocracy, no one of the Senators is a Sovereign; but the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109071:8"/>
whole Senate being united of one accord, is King. In a Democracy, no one of himſelf hath power to make the leaſt Ordinance; the People aſſembled are the Monarch. Thus every where appears an indiviſible Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo conform to the Laws of Nature is Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>In fine, it may be ſaid, that there never was Ariſtocracy, but founded upon the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and ruins of ſome Monarchy: moreover, that Tyranny, it's direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is the worſt of all Governments. Now from all that I have ſaid, it follows by a neceſſary conſequence, That the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chique State is better than any other.</p>

                        <p>1. Of the true good and happineſs of States. 2. Of the true good and happineſs of a King. 3. How Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city may be acquired.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THings reckon'd under the notion of Good, are of three ſorts. Corporal, as Health, Beauty, Strength, Agility, and the like. External, which we commonly call Goods of Fortune; as Birth, Riches, Dignities, Reputation, Friends, and ſuch others. The third ſort are thoſe of the Soul: theſe are ſimply and abſolutely good,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109071:8"/>
that is, good of themſelves; and ſo they can be no other but virtue alone.</p>
                     <p>Things accounted good are no further ſuch indeed, than as they promote our Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, and bring us to it; Corporal and External things are not inſtruments to effect this. But the good of the Soul is the true happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Felicity is not a ſimple habit; otherwiſe a man aſleep would be happy: but it conſiſteth in action, which is the true uſe of Virtue.</p>
                     <p>The Soul makes us capable of living hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily: for happineſs is meaſured by virtue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor can we be counted happy, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably as we are counted good.</p>
                     <p>The intention of Political Science is, to bring to paſs, that men lead their lives hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily; as I have obſerv'd in the precedent Chapter. 'Tis therefore certain, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires they be actually virtuous.</p>
                     <p>All that I have been diſcourſing is of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and confeſſeth truth. Whence clearly reſults, That the Politicks conſider virtue in a much more noble manner than Ethicks do; for theſe, confining themſelves to the forming of idle ſpeculations, can produce but an imperfect felicity, which the Schools do call Theoretical. The Politicks on the contrary go further, and cauſing us to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe virtue, do give us a Practical, that is, ſolid and perfect Felicity.</p>
                     <p>In fine, it is not doubted, but the Act is preferrable to the habit. Beſides, the Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Moral diſcourſes of virtue, can have
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109071:9"/>
no other aim, but at moſt, the welfare of particular perſons; which does not always produce that of the Publick: And the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, regarding the welfare of an whole State, provide at once for that of each particular; as a good Pilot, in endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſafety of his Ship, procures neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, the ſafety of all that are embarqued in it. Alſo, the care of the welfare of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons, ſeems to be beneath the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, except ſo far as it is neceſſary for the publick good. Yet ſometimes particular Men muſt of force ſuffer for the Publick Good; as when a Malefactor is puniſhed, and when ſome Houſes are pull'd down to ſave a Town from Fire, and from Enemies.</p>
                     <p>The happineſs of a State is of the ſame quality with that of particular perſons. For as we ſay, a Man is happy when he hath Strength, Riches, and Virtue; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we ſay a Common-wealth is happy when it is potent, rich, and juſtly governed.</p>
                     <p>A Monarch is, in reference to His State, what the Soul is to Man. There is no doubt therefore, but that the proper Goods of a King are thoſe of the Soul: and that he can poſſeſs no other. Fortune being beneath a true Soveraign, and extrinſick to Him, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give him ought of that kind from Gold or Glory: All that He hath doth ariſe from His own Virtue, His Power, His Treaſures, and the various effects of Beneficence which he holdeth in His Hand, do not conſtitute His Happineſs: as GOD Himſelf is not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109071:9"/>
Bleſſed by external Bleſſings, but only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them as a diſtribution made to His Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that He may cauſe them by ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means to experiment His Goodneſs.</p>
                     <p>The Magnificence of a Man renders him conſiderable, if his Spirit in it be Great and Heroick.</p>
                     <p>But it is not enough to have ſpoken of that which conſtitutes Felicity, we muſt take ſome account of the means which conduce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
                     <p>Nature, Conſtancy and Reaſon, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to endue us with Virtue. The two former do enrich the Mind, and diſpoſe it to receive Virtue; then Reaſon being cleared by the light of Precepts, makes it ſpring up, and cultivates it.</p>
                     <p>Of all Precepts, thoſe of greateſt effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy are the Political, which being indeed Laws, do command and oblige Men to obey, in a manner, blindly: neceſſitating and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining us to live well, whether we will or no. 'Tis upon this ground it hath been ſaid, That there lies no ſervitude at all in ſubmitting to the power of the Law; and that it's the proper act of Men truly free, to reduce their inclinations, and ſubject their practice to the ſame: Foraſmuch as the conforming of Life and Manners to the impulſes of Virtue, which is always right, always uncorrupt, is in truth a ſetting our our ſelves at full liberty, and an enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſement from the Empire of importunate and irregular Paſſions.</p>

                        <p>1. Of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy. 2. Of the Situation and Quality of <hi>France.</hi> 3. Of the Nature of the French.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Monarchick Government doth not more excell other Governments, than the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy doth all other Monarchies on Earth. It is hereditary, and for Twelve whole Ages there hath been ſeen Reigning from Male to Male, upon the Throne of <hi>France,</hi> the Auguſt Poſterity of <hi>Meroue</hi> of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> and of <hi>Hugh Capet.</hi> For it is exactly proved, that theſe three Races of our Kings, are Branches iſſued out of the ſame Stock. This very Succeſſion, ſo Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate as it hath been, and ſo long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, makes at preſent the ſureſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the welfare of the State; and carries in it Splendor, Reputation and Majeſty. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to how many Ills are Elective King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms expoſed? How many Cabals? How many Complottings; and in truth, Wars, are kept on foot by ſo many different agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? The one and the other <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and the Kingdom of the <hi>Poles,</hi> do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109071:10"/>
ſenſible proofs of this Opinion.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Spartans</hi> heretofore did draw ſo great an advantage from the Honour they had to be commanded by Princes of the Blood of <hi>Hercules:</hi> The <hi>French</hi> have far greater cauſe to glory; ſince in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of His Majeſties triumphant Anceſtors, there may be counted an hundred <hi>Heroes</hi> greater than <hi>Hercules</hi> himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Is there a Monarch in the World, whoſe juſt power is more abſolute, than that of our King? and by conſequent, is there a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy comparable to the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy? It is neceſſary that the power of a good King be not confin'd within other bounds than Reaſon and Equity do preſcribe: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there will ever be diviſion between Princes and People, to the ruin of them both. What a diſorder would it be in Man, if the Eye or Hand ſhould fail of following the impulſes of the Soul? this diſobeying and rebellious Member would prove dead, or ſeized with a Palſie. If then the whole Body ſhould fall into an univerſal revolt againſt the Spirit of Man, all the Symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the Order and oeconomy would be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly defaced. Thus the Subjects in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, once ceaſing to yield their King a full Obedience, and the King ceaſing to exerciſe His Soveraign Authority over them, the Political Ligatures are broken, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is diſſolved, by little and little all is reduced to extream calamities, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to Anarchy, and an annihilation.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109071:11"/>
Such are the inconveniencies that occur in Royalties of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> kind, where the Prince hath but a limited Authority; and if all that <hi>England</hi> ſuffer'd in the late times were pourtray'd here, it would be eaſie to obſerve of what importance it is unto the felicity of a Monarchy, that the Prince do in it command without reſtriction. In fine, the obedience of inſtrumental parts, as thoſe of Organical Bodies, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of a State, is of ſo indiſpenſible a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that the common good and conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of that Whole, which they compoſe, depends upon it. In Democracies, even the moſt tumultuous and diſorderly, all muſt bow under the Will of the multitude, though blind, ignorant and ſeduced: in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the parts of the Bodies of Brutes muſt act by their motions, though they be in rage and madneſs. And the reaſon of this neceſſity is, that the Body and the Soul, which is the form thereof, are but one indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Whole; ſo a King and Subjects are together but one whole, that is, one State.</p>
                     <p>In fine, the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with all the mixture that can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired for a compleat and perfect Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Counſellors of State do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an excellent Oligarchy in it; The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and other Officers of Judicature do form an Ariſtocracy; The Provoſts of Merchants, the Mayors, the Conſuls, and the General Eſtates do repreſent rarely well
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109071:11"/>
limited Democracy; ſo that all the different modes of governing by Laws, being united in the Monarchy, do render it as excellent and conſummate, as Reaſon can propoſe. The Regality of <hi>France</hi> is therefore of the Oeconomick kind; in which the King hath an abſolute power in his State, as the Father of a Family in his Houſe; and though he govern at His pleaſure, and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, it is always for the good of His Kingdom: even as the Maſter of an Houſe does Rule it with an entire Authority, and inceſſantly provides for the accommodating of this Family. There is nothing Deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical nor Barbarous in <hi>France,</hi> as in the States of the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> and <hi>Turks.</hi> In ſhort, our Laws are Holy and Equitable, to a greater degree than in any Common-wealth that ever was; and they are conceived with ſo much prudence and judgement, that they are apt to make the People happy in the gentle times of Peace, and enable them to triumph in the occaſions of War.</p>
                     <p>The Situation and Compactneſs of <hi>France</hi> are known to all the World; ſo that it would be a needleſs labour, ſhould I here expatiate, to ſhew the Beauty and Richneſs of our Grounds and of our Rivers: or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how we abound in Wine, in Corn, in Silk, in Wools, in Cloth, in Wood, in Cattle, in Salt, in Mines, and in Money; how neceſſary we are to our neighbours; and to what degree we may forego their Succors and their Merchandiſe. I might
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109071:12"/>
juſtly be accus'd of a fondneſs for ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diſcourſe, if I ſhould particularly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all theſe great advantages; and as much, if I ſhould ſpeak of the pureneſs of the Air, and the incredible number of Inhabitants: the moſt ignorant having a full and an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red knowledge of 'em. I ſhall only ſay, that it need not be wondred at, if Men whom Fortune brings forth, and breeds up in ſo excellent a Climate, be capable of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly contriving, and ſucceſsfully executing the haughtieſt Enterprizes. In fine, its an unſpeakable ſatisfaction to a Man that ſets himſelf to Treat of the Politicks of <hi>France,</hi> that he may know the <hi>French,</hi> of all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon Earth, are the moſt ſuſceptible of Learning, of Policy, and of Government. For if one conſider the Situation of the Country, he may be aſſured, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations of Heaven are eminently favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it. The Experience and Skill of the Ancients do inform us, that the Situation of Regions is the prime cauſe of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the Men in 'em; as it is of the quality of the Plants and Fruits which they produce.</p>
                     <p>The Laws of this State being ſo Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as they are, do argue the Wiſdom of thoſe that enacted them; and of the People that accepted them; whereof the long du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Monarchy is a ſecond proof.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, the great Acts of the <hi>French</hi> do ſpeak their Valour. They ſerve in our Age, for examples to all Nations in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109071:12"/>
matter of execution; and not only ſo, but are as eminent likewiſe for their Counſels: And they have choice of the beſt Generals on Earth to lead Armies, as well as of the beſt Soldiers. That heat and impetuoſity which is taken to be viſible in all their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, is an effect of their high Courage; and the confidence they ſhew, with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what leſs of reſtraint and reſpect than pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence could wiſh, can be imputed to nothing but their fearleſneſs: In fine, the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, declared with very much judgment, <hi>That the</hi> French <hi>ſeem'd to be Fools, but were really wiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, ſince we know what <hi>France</hi> is, let us examine what may moſt conduce to the well-governing of it, to the conſerving it in Plenty, and in Reputation; in what it may be augmented, and how its intereſts with the neighboring States ought to be ſecured. In a word, let us ſee what way may be taken to maintain the parts that compoſe it, in ſo regular an harmony, that they may all inceſſantly contribute to the weal of the Monarchy.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>OUr Anceſtors have ever been great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers of Religion. Long before the coming of JESUS CHRIST, the <hi>Druids</hi> were their Prieſts, and had an entire dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, not only of affairs relating to the ſervice of their falſe Gods, but of thoſe too which concern'd diſtributive Juſtice; even in the general Aſſemblies held by all the <hi>Gauls,</hi> whether for confirmation of Peace, or for reconciliation of diſagreeing parties, who might embroil the Republiques, or whether the making of ſome common Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional enterpriſes was in queſtion, ſtill there was no reſolution formed, but by their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. No wonder then, if ſince the Truth of the Goſpel appeared, and made known the holineſs of Chriſtianity, the Prelates have conſerv'd ſo many Prerogatives and Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. They have been called to the Royal Counſels; they have aſſiſted at the deciſion of the moſt important affairs, they have eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where hold the firſt rank; much hath been attributed to their Judgments, and the reſpect had for their Character and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109071:13"/>
Dignity, hath gotten them great and ſignal priviledges, which have exempted them from contributing to the burthens of the State; though at the ſame time wealth was heap'd upon them by Alms and Foundations. But as Church-men, after the mode of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> uſe to convert whatever is freely granted them into a point of Religion; in ſuch manner, that by little and little, they engage the tender Conſciences of the faithful in vain ſcruples, and poſſeſſes them with a ſuperſtitious fear of offending; they have not been wanting to aſſert and maintain, that theſe exemptions and privileges were not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally given them; that Kings did but ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle them in poſſeſſion of an advantage which was by Divine Right inſeperable from their Profeſſion: that they, while Men of War fought for the Glory and Liberty of their Country, ſufficiently did their part, in lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, as as was anciently done, their eyes and hands to GOD, to impetrate His powerful Protection: that their Arms were Prayers, Oblations, and Penitence, which they never forbore to uſe for the publick ſafety; that from the Caves and Deſerts whither they retired, they ſent up Meterials to the higheſt Heavens, which formed into Thunder there, might fall back upon, and beat down the enemies of the <hi>French</hi> name. In fine, That if Gentlemen gave their blood, and the People their ſweat and labours for the welfare of the Kingdom, they Day and Night did pour out Tears at the feet of Altars
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109071:14"/>
to diſarm the wrath of GOD. Upon ſuch reaſonings as theſe the Eccleſiaſticks have founded their pretences for poſſeſſing thoſe goods, of which, publick and private Piety had made them Proprietors, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning themſelves for what ſucceſs the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral affairs of the State might have.</p>
                     <p>But this is not all, they have tried by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers reiterated attempts, to make themſelves Maſters of all the Temporal Juriſdiction, and draw Civil cauſes unto their Tribunal: nor have they forgotten any pretext which they thought might promote this dangerous enterpriſe; ſometimes they have pleaded, That the Church alone having right to judge of the Validity of Marriages, as being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Sacrament, all that depended on 'em ought to be handled before Eccleſiaſtick Judges. Sometimes again, That Chriſtians binding themſelves in their Contracts by an Oath, the cogniſance appertain'd to them. Such Kings as perceived that theſe attempts did tend to the overthrow of their Authority, withſtood them with a right Kingly vigour. But what difficulties were there not of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to be overcome for a full attainment of their end? and what reſiſtance did not the Church-men make to maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſo unreaſonable an Uſurpation? Our Hiſtory affords us examples of it, which I cannot call to mind without grief and wonder. Their obſtinacy hath gone ſo very far, that they have forced our Kings to grant them Declarations upon unequitable and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109071:14"/>
diſadvantageous conditions; and ſo capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with them both for the Tenths and Acknowledgments of the Lands which they poſſeſs; as alſo for the Rights of Mortmain and Indemnity. I cannot tell by what name I ſhould call theſe proceedings. Our Sirs of the Clergy could not doubt, but that being born Subjects of the Crown, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could releaſe them of this duty; and that the privileges which they have, or rather which they have invaded, being founded upon the holineſs of their Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, could not extend to theſe Temporal Goods, which always are the States. Yet the old error is ſo potent, and their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination ſo ſtrongly prepoſſeſs'd for theſe Immunities, that they can ſcarce acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Kings Sovereignty to this day. What clamour did they not raiſe about the Arreſt of the laſt Commiſſion of Oyer in <hi>Auvergne?</hi> with what fervour did they charge their Deputies to remonſtrate to His Majeſty concerning it? Yet this Arreſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novateth nothing; but is, in all reſpects, conform to the preſcript, and purſuant to the uſe of <hi>Charles</hi> the VIII. his Pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Sanction, Kings and Emperors, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver practis'd otherwiſe in ſuch caſes. Nor can it be deny'd, but that Religion coming, among others, under a Political conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and Kings being Protectors of the Church, of its Doctrine, and of its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, it's a part of their Office to notifie to men the Laws of GOD. The Tables were
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109071:15"/>
conſigned to the hands of <hi>Moſes,</hi> not to the hands of <hi>Aaron;</hi> and in the Temple of GOD, the Law of GOD was often heard by the People, from the Mouth of their Kings. 'Tis upon this account that <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec</hi> was both King and Prieſt; and 'tis from this intention that the Emperors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the firſt Synods, that They ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gave judgments contrary to Sydonical deciſions; and that other Chriſtian Princes have had liberty to receive, or not receive Councils, though Legitimate and Univerſal. Nothing is more conſentaneous to perfect equity, than that the Gentlemen of the Clergy be obliged to contribute to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick charges: They receive vaſt ſums from the State; and what they pay to the King out of 'em, amouts not to a ſixth part of what they duly ought to pay.</p>
                     <p>But to reduce them gently to reaſon, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches muſt be made by degrees; and in ways that may be to them unperceivable. Firſt, they may be calmly told of the right of Mortmain, which being part of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient inheritance of the Crown cannot be alienated. They may ever and anon be put in mind, that Reſidence is of Divine Right; that it is unbecoming a Prelate, or an Eccleſiaſtick, to keep a great Table, to have a multitude of Pages, Horſes, Dogs; intimation may be made them, that the King intends to reſtore the ancient Law of Fiefs; by which all ſorts of perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, are obliged to ſet forth, at any time,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109071:15"/>
a certain number of Soldiers, equipped and paid at their charge. In fine, they may be required to make a new valuation of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Rents. For what pretext will they have to complain, or be diſcontented? Can they find any fault at all in it if His Majeſty doth put things in their Primitive State; which is the foundation of all publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Diſcipline? Other inſinuative means may be ſet on work, which ſhall make no ſhew at firſt, yet may prove in the ſequel, of incredible advantage to the King's Affairs.</p>
                     <p>While I ſpeak here of the Clergy, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to ſpeak of any but Biſhops, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Pariſh-Prieſts, and Chappellans. I know well, that taking the word <hi>Clerus</hi> in its ancient latitude, it may be ſaid to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all Chriſtians: but I extend it not ſo much as to Monaſticks, who in truth were, at their riſe, ſo far from having par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and conventual Churches, as now they have, that they were reckoned Laicks, that is, of the People, and had their places ſeparate from the Prieſts.</p>
                     <p>Whatever care Kings hitherto could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly take to hinder frauds in Beneficiary mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they have not been able to find means effectual for it: Their prudence hath been ſtill ſurmounted by the pravity of men, which never wanteh artifice and expedients in occaſions that concern their profit. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, theſe frauds are of ſuch a quality, and ſo important, in reference to the ſalvation
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:109071:16"/>
of all Chriſtians, that the charitable ſagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Laws ought to be indefatigably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed about them: neither Pains nor Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſhould be ſpared, in a deſign whoſe accompliſhment is ſo neceſſary. And indeed, what miſchief doth not follow; for example, when a wicked man, by intruſion, gets poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome Benefice with Cure of Souls, all his Sacerdotal Functions are ſo many Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; (for he is a ſuſpended perſon, <hi>ipſo facto</hi>) all the Abſolutions he gives are null; the Fruits of the Benefice cannot be his, becauſe he is not the lawful Guardian of it; and ſo his appropriating them to his uſe, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Larceny; for which he is indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bound to make reſtitution. But be it a Biſhop that commits this act of intruſion; and all the Conſecrations of Prieſts which he ſhall ſolemnize are null, whence will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult a nullity of all the Abſolutions thoſe pretended Prieſts ſhall give. What a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenation of Crimes? what a dreadful ſeries of Evils, Simonies, Confidences, and other bad means which are uſed to finger Benefices, do tend to the ſame Conſequences. Sure, the cure of this Malady, Mortal to ſo many thouſands of Souls, is an atchievement wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a King.</p>
                     <p>I am of Opinion then, that to cut up the root of all theſe diſorders, the King might create a Secretary in his Council of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and when this Officer is in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his charge, a Declaration of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ſhould come forth; by which, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:109071:16"/>
the great abuſes that have crept int-Beneficiary matters, it ſhould be ordained that all the Benefices in the Kingdom be Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>giſtred by the ſaid Secretary of that Council, and no diſpatch there made until the Deeds, upon which a Benefice is claimed, have been ſeen and ſigned, and placed in the Regiſter by the ſame Secretary, upon pain of the nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of all that may have been petition'd for, and granted; Cognizance of all cauſes ariſing in conſequence of this Declaration, muſt be given to the Grand Council, and this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Juriſdiction would facilitate the verification of it.</p>
                     <p>This Declaration would produce ſeveral advantages. One is, that there could be no more fraud uſed, in order to demiſſions, or to reſignations; and the Bankers of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would no longer have means to promote the cheats of pretenders to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices. Another is, that the King would exactly know all that the Church does poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs in <hi>France;</hi> which is a matter of extreme neceſſity, both for the regulating of the Tenths, and alſo for other conſiderations. A third advantage would be, that in proceſs of time this Secretary of Conſcience might make a Bank in the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, which is, to the King, of unſpeakable conſequence: for by this means, all the Money that goes into <hi>Italy</hi> out of <hi>France</hi> would be known; and upon ſuch knowledge it would be more eaſie for him to take his meaſures with the Pope and Colledge of Cardinals. A fourth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:109071:17"/>
advantage is, that the King, by degrees, might become Maſter of all the Benefices of the Kingdom, in the ſame manner as the Pope is Maſter of the Biſhopricks and Abbies; which would augment the Royal Authority. That I may explain my ſelf, I will reſume the thing from its original. In the firſt Age of Chriſtianity, the firſt Biſhopricks were conferred without any Bulls from the Pope at all. Afterward He bethought Him, to ſend or write unto the Chapters, who then choſe the Biſhops, and recommended to them, to reſpect the merit of ſuch or ſuch a one, when they ſhould proceed to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. I think that <hi>Alexander</hi> the III. was the firſt Inventer of theſe kind of Letters; and they were called Bulls, becauſe they were ſeal'd up with the Pope's Seal, (<hi>Bulla</hi> being Latin for a Seal.) At the beginning, theſe Letters which the Popes thus ſent, were but ſimple Letters of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and recommendation: but it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that the Chapters reverenced them, and that here and there, at leaſt, one, who had obtained them, was choſen; all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to Biſhopricks came to believe, that it was neceſſary to obtain them. Thus, what was at firſt but, as hath been ſaid, a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, became at length a point of right and duty. Such was its Riſe. Now this being certain, there may be uſe made of the example: and thus, when a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Benefice ſhould be vacant, the King might order, that a Letter be written to the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109071:17"/>
Patron, and ſome Perſon recommended to his Nomination. There is no cauſe to doubt, but the Patron will Nominate whom His Majeſty hath thus recommended; ſo that inſenſibly it will grow a Cuſtom, to take the King's recommendations, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while perſons did thoſe of the Popes; and as the Bulls became at length neceſſary for Biſhopricks and Abbies, ſo the King's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhall become neceſſary for all ſorts of Benefices, and He render Himſelf Maſter of all Church-men. The King, in this, will have ſufficient reaſon, becauſe He being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of Religion, which is the prime Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of every State, it is His intereſt to know whether they that ſhall be provided of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, be Orthodox, and of good Life; leſt they ſpread ſome bad Doctrine among the people; for Hereſies and Scandals do cauſe diviſion in the Common-wealth, as well as Schiſms in the Church. Beſides, it concerns the tranquillity of the State, that Curates, who have the direction of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, be well-inclin'd for the good of the Kingdom, and ready to keep particulr Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in their duty.</p>
                     <p>To deſcend now unto the caſe of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick Religious, and find out a way (for rendring them uſeful to the State) to take them off from that lazineſs and loathſome beggery in which they live, as alſo reduce them to ſuch a number as may be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate to other ranks of men in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. It is to be noted, that there are three
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109071:18"/>
ſorts of Monaſticks. The firſt is made up of the Orders of S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> S. <hi>Benedict,</hi> S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and <hi>Premonſtrey.</hi> Theſe are they that poſſeſs the bulkie riches of the Church; I mean the Abbies and Priories. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſort comprehends the <hi>Carthuſians,</hi> the <hi>Minimes,</hi> the <hi>Coeleſtins,</hi> the <hi>Feuillans,</hi> and ſome others, who poſſeſs Goods with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and beg not but by Toleration. The third kind, is that of the meer <hi>Mendicants,</hi> who ſubſiſt by Alms, as do the <hi>Jacobins,</hi> the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> and their branches, that is, the Reform'd, as they term 'em, who are iſſued from them. Theſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their Vow of Monaſtick Poverty, yet are not deſtitute of ſome foundations: but they plead for themſelves, that the Pope is Proprietor of the Goods, they do but take the Profits; which certainly is a vain and frivolous ſubtilty. The Female Religious being compriſed under theſe three kinds, there is no need to make of them a ſeparate Article.</p>
                     <p>There are too to many Monks. Its an abuſe ſo prejudicial to the Kingdom, that the King can no longer diſſemble it: it is time to take it ſeriouſly and effectually in hand. For Monks live in ſingle ſtate, they raiſe no Families, get no Children, and ſo are barren grounds that bring forth no fruit to the Crown. Beſide, the blind obedience by which they are tyed to the pleaſure of the Pope, doth form a foreign Monarchy in the very bowels of <hi>France;</hi> and into it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109071:18"/>
they train along the credulous people, which is a thing of very great conſequence. This Politie is founded on the abuſive and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Maxims of <hi>Rome;</hi> which too are purely Political. For, that the obedience which Monaſticks give the Pope, is Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, there is no colour to pretend: nor is there a Chriſtian but ſees what his duty binds him to in this caſe; and is altogether ſubject to his Holineſs in Doctrinals, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out need of making particular vows to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him. The name of Religion in the matter, is but a phantaſm, and a falſe pretext which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> aſſumeth, to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment its Temporal Power, and to have its creatures in all quarters. By conſequence the abuſes ought to be retrenched, as was done by <hi>Charlemagne</hi> in his time, and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other great Kings.</p>
                     <p>But for the effecting of this I ſhould not at all adviſe, that the attempt be openly made. For that would be to draw upon the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, the importune clamours of all the Monks, and their Zealots; nay, to draw <hi>Rome</hi> upon their backs, which might coſt them ſome trouble. In fine, it would be to draw on them the People; who are ever fond of Novelties that ſurpriſe them, or are prejudicial to them, and always averſe to thoſe which they have foreſeen, and are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for them. 'Tis therefore by-ways that muſt be taken. The firſt which ſeems to me fit to be pitcht upon, would be, to require of the Monaſtick Communities, that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109071:19"/>
they diſpatch Miſſions unto <hi>America,</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> to convert the Salvages, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Holy Sacraments to Chriſtians. The Monks, who are commonly impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, will ſtrain to ſet forth the greateſt number of their fraternity they poſſibly may, in hope to make conſiderable Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; thus there will be forwardneſs enough to embarque. The preſent juncture is advantageous for this deſign. For they are charged with more Perſons than they are able to maintain; Charity being evidently cooled toward them. A ſecond means may be, to debar them the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Women. It is ſcandalous to ſee Religious Men receive viſits from them in Churches; and there, in preſence of the Holy Sacrament, ſpend whole After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons with them. For remedy it might be ordained, that they ſhould have Parlours, where Women might go to conſult them. The thing is a point of deceney; and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, the <hi>Carthuſian</hi> Friars, and all Nuns, generally have. The third means might be, that the Fathers of ſuch as enter into Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould pay an Annual Penſion to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by way of Alms, during their Sons life; which is the practice in <hi>Spain.</hi> This Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſome will ſay, cauſeth in <hi>Spain</hi> an huge multiplication of Monks. But 'tis not the Penſion that fills the Cloiſters in that Country; 'tis the licence the Monks have to do what they pleaſe. In <hi>France</hi> they are not upon ſuch Terms. A fourth means, is to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:109071:19"/>
oblige the Monaſticks to abide in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, and not go abroad but very rarely, and for urgent affairs: ſo do the <hi>Carthuſians.</hi> A fifth, to embroil the Monks with the Biſhops; for which they are ſufficiently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed. A ſixth, to prohibit that Children of Sixteen (when as yet they know not what they do) bind not themſelves by Vows, which engage them for the whole remainder of their lives: but remit that Ceremony till their <hi>22d.</hi> year of Age. The ſeventh means would be to ſuppreſs that Congregation, as they call it, among Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick perſons, (as for inſtance, there are the Congregations of S. <hi>Maur,</hi>) and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that the Religious who make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in an houſe, do there fix; not cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from Lower <hi>Britannie,</hi> for example, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Paris;</hi> nor inceſſantly changing, as their wont is, unleſs ſome indiſpenſible neceſſity does oblige to ſuch changes. The <hi>Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> keep in their houſes, and run not from place to place: Nuns do the ſame. The Voyages of Monks, and all their tranſmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, have no other end, but to get an univerſal acquaintance. Beyond all this, it may be declared to the Monks, (at leaſt its a thing that ſhould be done in its ſeaſon) how that the King underſtands not their Monaſtick Profeſſion does Exempt them from his Juriſdiction. Thus the Orders being purged from their impurities, will reſume their ancient Iuſtre, and be true Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries of Doctrine and Sanctity. In fine,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109071:20"/>
no perſon will doubt, but the King may take cogniſance of all that concerns the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Policy of the Church; becauſe this is in ſuch ſort annexed to the Government of States, that not a Patriarch, nor even the Pope himſelf, can make any regulation of it without His Majeſties conſent.</p>
                     <p>That reaſon of State which preſſeth for a retrenching of the number of Monks, does alſo reflect upon Nuns; and that with the more Juſtice, becauſe the greateſt part of young Women, who become Votaries, are driven thereunto by the violence of their kindred. There will never want juſt means to hinder this abuſe from having a longer courſe. As for inſtance, Young Women may be declared incapable of making vows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 22 years of age at the leaſt. It may be enacted, that they never ſhall be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, [<hi>i. e.</hi> ſetled of the Order] in the Convent where they have had their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either as Penſionaries or Novices. This would be well enacted. For oft-times the Nuns, in hope to the gainers by their Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, do flatter the ſilly Maidens, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade 'em to live with them. All kind of humane iuducements muſt be remov'd, and the inſpirations of the Holy Ghoſt, left to their full operation. It may again be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that Recluſes do take no Money, as a Portion, but only ſimple Penſions yearly for life, and thoſe likewiſe cautiouſly limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. A Law too may be made, that the Goods which might fall to a Daughter from
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109071:20"/>
her Parents, and her collateral Kindred, ſhould at their Deceaſe, fall to the State, and the King by repreſentation, be inveſted with the ſame Right to the Goods of the deceaſed as this Daughter had had, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the Publick for the loſs ſuſtained by a Recluſe, being incapacitated to raiſe a Family. Further, a general Regulation might<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be made of all Marriages of young Women, with due reſpect had to the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of each of 'em in particular; and it might be ordered, that in caſe any of them would take up a Religious life, they ſhould carry as much with them into Religion, as into the Married ſtate. For if the Order was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Daughters becoming Votaries, ſhould have leſs Portions than thoſe that Married, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo hugely covetous they are, would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them to the Cloiſter. But when they ſhall find no profit in taking this courſe, they will rather chuſe to diſpoſe of them in Marriage, and make Alliances by that means.</p>
                     <p>This ſubject inclines me to ſay ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that the moderating of Portions is a piece of the ancient Civil Law of the <hi>French,</hi> and of divers other Nacions, in which Daughters had nothing at all. Thence it is as we ſee in the Cuſtoms, that a Nobleman is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed to Marry his Daughter with a Noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay of Roſes, and ſhe becomes diſabled to pretend to any other Portion, provided the Match be ſuitable and fitting. This moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is neceſſary: Foraſmuch, as the vaſt wealth which is given to Daughters in Marriage,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109071:21"/>
does incommode the richeſt Houſes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Gentlemen themſelves would no more contract undue Alliances; and ſo the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility recover their ancient eſteem. Young Womens Birth, their Beauty, their Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their Virtue, and their Ability in the management of Domeſtick Affairs, would be to them inſtead of Wealth. They would make it their care to lay up a rich Stock of ſo many precious things, that perhaps it may one day come to paſs, that Men will, as heretofore they did, give Money to have Wives; whereas at preſent, Women do ſo to purchaſe Husbands. I have ſpoken here of Marriages occaſionally; I am well aware, that the Matter ought to be reſerved for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Chapter. To conclude, its a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient of the Glory of a King, to honour the Holy See; to love and protect the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, to maintain the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church in its Liberties; never ſuffer that any propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions be advanced any way, that may wound the Authority of the Canons; and employ all the rigor of his Ordinances a gainſt perſons, who ſhall have the raſhneſs to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a ſuſpected or erroneous Doctrine.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>1. That Biſhops ought to be near the King. 2. Of the Penſion to be paid the Order for a Monk enter'd. 3. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſticks cannot Alienate; therefore neither ſell a Rent-charge. 4. They ſhall not have power to purchaſe.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>I Have affirmed <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. That Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are obliged by Command of GOD, unto reſidence. This is true: yet foraſmuch as they are alſo the Kings Subjects, and Royal Dignity requireth, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty have Biſhops about him, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had; it is fit to ordain, That each Biſhop be at Court Three Months every year, attending His Majeſty, to Honour Him; during which time they may negotiote their Affairs; and the reſt of the year abide fix'd in their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes; the King aſſigning to each of them the Months in which their preſence will be needful.</p>
                        <p>In the ſame <hi>Chapter,</hi> I have ſaid, That to prevent the vaſt number of Monks it ſhould be ordained, that the Parents of ſuch as enter into an Order, ſhould pay
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:109071:22"/>
an annual Penſion to that Order during the perſons Lives. The effect of this Law would be, that ſuch a Penſion being a Monachal Right in form of Clericature given by Act of State; they that would have Revenue enough to be Monaſticks, would have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be Secular Prieſts. And ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe Devotion ſhould incline them to take Orders, and Conſecrate themſelves unto GOD, would rather chuſe to remain Seculars, than ſhut themſelves up in a Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter all the remainder of their Lives. Now the more to fortifie this Law, it ſhould be added, That Biſhops make no more Prieſts upon the Title of Poverty, upon Penalty of maintaining them: The reaſon againſt it, as to Secular Prieſts, being as ſtrong in reference to Regulars; becauſe it is no leſs a diſparagement to the Clergy, that a Prieſt Monk do beg, and fall into extream pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (which may happen) than that one of the other rank do ſo.</p>
                        <p>It is manifeſt, that Monaſtick communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have no power to Alienate any thing; and that Monks do daily re-enter into their Eſtates, which they poſſeſſed heretofore. Hence it follows, that neither can they charge them with any Rents for Money taken up: Foraſmuch as by theſe kind of Contracts, they Mortgage their Lands: but to engage an Eſtate in ſuch a manner, is to make a kind of Alienation.</p>
                        <p>'Tis a fetch of the Benedictine Monks to take up Money for Rent to be paid by
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:109071:22"/>
them; that ſo they may appear always poor, and have pretexts to ſolicite the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality of devout People: alſo that they may have Protectors, for the greater number of their Creditors is, the greater is the number of perſons intereſſed in their conſervation.</p>
                        <p>Yet there is nothing more unjuſt than this Cuſtom: For there are Monaſtick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities that owe more than all their Goods, moveable and immoveable are worth. The Monks care not though their Houſe be ruin'd, nor though they ruine ſome of their Creditors, provided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſubſiſt. For by paſſing from one Convent to another, they are quitted of all the Debts they have created.</p>
                        <p>It greatly concerns the Publick to Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit theſe kind of Contracts, that Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks may be kept from defrauding any Man for the future; and to decree, that the Contractor ſhall pay the Rents Contracted for, and they bound to do it, both all in common, and each of them in particular: then, that the Notaries be Fined and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared incapable of bearing any Office: Or if inſolvent, condemned to the Gallies for 101 years: Moreover, that the Purchaſers of ſuch Rents ſhall, for their part, pay a Mulct of 3000 Livres to His Majeſty, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Money be converted to His uſe.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, it would be very fit to require all Notaries, all Creditors of Monaſticks and the Monaſticks themſelves to make Declaration of the Sums and Rents charged
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:109071:23"/>
upon them, bring in the Contracts for the ſame before Commiſſioners nominated by the King to be Regiſtred, and this within a time expreſly limited: which being once paſs'd, no more ſhall be received; and all Contracts not Regiſtred, remain null, and as if they were cleared. This courſe would be very ſevere, but excellent to reduce the folk of the Cloiſter to Reaſon.</p>
                        <p>There is an important Obſervation to be made too, namely, That all the Contracts which Church men have made, are utterly null, unleſs their Creditors can make it appear, that the Money they lent did turn to the profit of the Church, and that there was an authentick permiſſion to make ſuch Contracts. This Doctrine is a point of Law; for the Church is ever a Minor, and all that it poſſeſſeth hath come from the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of particular perſons; without whoſe conſent, or at leaſt the Magiſtrates, and ſuch as are capable of it, the Eccleſiaſticks can make no alterations in the Eſtates they have received. So that the King may not only forbid Contracts for the future; but alſo Declare thoſe to be diſſolved, which have been made heretofore, and diſcharge the Monaſteries of them. Debts have been annulled for leſs reaſons often. It muſt likewiſe be prohibited to Monks, and to the Church, to purchaſe any Eſtate in Land, or High-rents, upon pain of ſuch Contracts being null and void in Law; and the Sellers and Notaries incurring the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned penalties.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="37" facs="tcp:109071:23"/>Our Lords the Prelates have lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought them, and reſolved to compell ſuch Gentlemen as have Chappels in their Houſes, where the Sacrifice of the Maſs hath been at any time performed, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane the ſaid Chappels, or endow them with Land for the maintenance of a Prieſt. This would be a means to gain the Church more than Two hundred thouſand Livres of Rent at one blow; wherefore it will be fit to Ordain, that this enterprize of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops do not take effect; except in caſe of Chapels built hereafter, and built for other perſons.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>A King cannot have a more Illuſtrious Object of his Cares and Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than the preſerving of that Religion which he hath received from his Anceſtors in the States he governs: becauſe diverſity of Belief of Divine Service, and of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, doth divide his Subjects, and breeds
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:109071:24"/>
Animoſities among them: Whence ariſe Contentions, War, and in the end an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal defiance. Unity of belief, on the contrary, knits Men together; and 'tis ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſeen, but that Fellow-ſubjects who call upon GOD in one and the ſame Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and offer at the ſame Altars, do alſo fight with the ſame Arms, or under the ſame Banners. If this Maxim be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally true in Chriſtian Politicks, and the Religion we profeſs the only one, as it is, that we can ſavingly embrace, the Princes are obliged to maintain it with all their Might, and employ that Soveraign Power for the Glory of the true GOD, which they hold of his Goodneſs. The <hi>Pagans,</hi> whoſe particular conduct was ſo prudent and juſt, and who have left us ſo many Examples of wiſdom and virtue, made it their principle, not to ſuffer in their Republicks any novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that thwarted the common and popular belief; and they adher'd ſo peremptorily unto it, that they would not ſo much as permit any man to undeceive them of their Errors. The Books of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> which had been found near his Grave, and contained the ancient Religion of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Senate cauſed to be burnt; becauſe the Praetor <hi>Rutilius,</hi> who had been commiſſion'd to read them, affirmed upon Oath, That the Contents of e'm tended to ſubvert the Religion which the People obſerved at that time. They refus'd, even to open their eyes unto the light of truth, though known
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:109071:24"/>
to them, when they apprehended it would be novel to the people. They rather choſe to ſtick to Fables, which length of years had conſecrated among them, and the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude was through cuſtom addicted to. Thus too the <hi>Athenians</hi> thought they did an act of neceſſary Juſtice in condemning <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> to death, for having taken on him to perſuade the people that there was but one only GOD. They knew however, that in truth this Philoſopher was the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his time, the Honour of the City, and of all <hi>Greece:</hi> the diſcerning men amongſt them were convinc'd of the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of this Doctrine, and the Sect of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> made profeſſion of it; ſo that it muſt be confeſs'd, the fall of <hi>Gentiliſm,</hi> and ſubverſion of Idols, is an effect of the hand of GOD, who alone can work miracles of Grace and Omnipotence.</p>
                     <p>The Kings, His Majeſties Predeceſſors, have ſet themſelves with unwearied dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to preſerve the Catholick Religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable: They have never failed to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors of the Apoſtolick See, and the Church. They expelled the <hi>Arrians;</hi> they turned their Arms, and expoſed their lives againſt the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigenſes;</hi> they vanquiſh'd e'm; they deſtroy'd e'm; they puniſh'd the Poor men of <hi>Lions:</hi> In fine, they have provided that Chriſtianity receive no harm in any places unto which their Authority extended. The laſt Age produced a new Monſter to oppoſe the Church. <hi>France</hi> ſaw him born in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109071:25"/>
and unhappily bred him up, with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral complices of his Impiety and Revolt. Hiſtory will tell Poſterity how much Blood was ſhed during the courſe of well nigh Fourſcore years to quell this dangerous Sect: and the world well know, that the Zeal there was to reduce Hereticks to their duty, did take up the Reigns of Six of our Kings; the glory of cutting off the laſt head of this <hi>Hydra,</hi> being reſerved for his preſent Majeſty. But it is expedient to ſee what weapons muſt be uſed for an execution ſo long expected.</p>
                     <p>There is no cauſe to doubt, but that upon the Principles of Chriſtianity, and Maxims of Policy, its neceſſary to reduce all the Kings Subjects to one and the ſame Belief: And though they that make Profeſſion of the pretended Reformed Religion, be now without Arms, without Strong-holds, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Treaſure, without an Head, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Allies; yet they are not out of caſe to be feared. They ſtill retain a remembrance of their boldneſs, and by-paſs'd Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: they look back on the Towns they once ſeized, and out of which they could not be driven but by force of Arms, as if they were their proper Inheritance, and had been unjuſtly pluck'd out of their hands; they bear in their hearts the ſame averſion for Order and Diſcipline, that they ever had; and their minds are always inclining to revolt, and to Confuſion and Anarchy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It diſquiets them not to think who ſhall
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:109071:25"/>
head them; they have Soldiers of their own number, whom they can advance to be Captains by giving them Authority to command e'm. They perſuade themſelves, that if they were in Arms, they ſhould want neither Money nor Friends. They believe, that the Glory of the King attracts as much Envy on him as Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and that his Virtue raiſeth in his Neighbours no leſs Anger than Terrour. In ſhort, there is ground to think, that he will have more than an Hundred Thouſand Men of his Enemies in the heart of his State, while there are <hi>Huguenots</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> they too, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, do but wait an occaſion to make their Muſters. Thus they are perpetual Obſtacles to the Deſigns that might be formed; and though weak, may nothwithſtanding be dreaded. 'Tis true, the honeſt men of their Communion do well know, that they cannot be in a calmer repoſe than they now enjoy by the Grace of the King, and under the ſecurity of his Edicts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in theſe matters the multitude carries it. Theſe are a Torrent, that by its Rapidity, overturns Rocks which ſeems unmoveable.</p>
                     <p>It will be ſaid, that the good treatment which the <hi>Huguenots</hi> receive, doth preſerve the friendſhip of the <hi>German</hi> Princes for <hi>France;</hi> and if favourable Juſtice ſhould be no longer done them, the King would loſe the moſt potent and moſt conſiderable of his Allies. This diſcourſe is but a found, and void of all ſubſtance of reaſon: for, beſide that the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> are not of the Religion of our Hereticks; They need not the Kings Protection for maintaining the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots</hi>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:109071:26"/>
in their pretended liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: but the <hi>French</hi> Arms ſecuring them againſt the power of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and principally of the Emperor, who hath divers pretenſions upon them; they cannot recede from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance they have made with his Majeſty; nor will they do it, though the laſt man of the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots</hi> was brought to the Scaffold: nay, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the Kings Forces are ſo uſeful to all thoſe Proteſtants, it will would be their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt not at all to Arm themſelves for the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots</hi> preſervation, but far otherwiſe, even to promote their expulſion out of <hi>France:</hi> and the reaſon is, becauſe if this party were in a condition to raiſe ſtirs, the King would have his hands full of work to repreſs them: and ſo his Forces being diſſipated, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror might take his time to enlarge his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: the thing that <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth did, when <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt was not in a poſſibility to ſuccour the Princes. It being therefore certain, that the Liberty of <hi>Germany</hi> hath its ſupport and prop in the Arms of the King; they are not ſollicitous there for the affairs of the <hi>Huguenots</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> and ſince the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Empire are knit to his Majeſty by other engagements than thoſe of Religion, they will continue the ſame Deportment; and his Majeſty on his part, will always have the ſame reaſons to ſuccour them, though the time ſhould come that he ſhould have no more <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots</hi> in his Kingdom. No ſuccour neither may they hope for from <hi>England;</hi> that's a State too weak to make any trial of ſtrength againſt <hi>France:</hi> all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there are muſt paſs the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:109071:26"/>
Sea; and the Iſle be disfurniſh'd of Soldiers and Proviſions; yet this all would be nothing to purpoſe: mean time their affairs would lie expos'd to the Levity and Lunacy of the people. <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Swedeland</hi> are of like conſideration; and they both have other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts to Negotiate with the King, than thoſe of the <hi>Huguenots. Denmark</hi> is defective in power. The <hi>Calviniſts</hi> mount unto a ſtrain of Policy above ordinary, when they would have us believe, That whatever is not of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion is of the Opinion of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renton:</hi> the <hi>Lutherans</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſympathize with them leſs than with us. Thus the King hath nothing to be afraid of from the pretended Allies of the <hi>Huguenots.</hi> Yet theſe men, as I have already ſaid, are to be feared; and they would be ſeen ſtoutly to beſtir themſelves, if ſome extraordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion ſhould happen in <hi>France,</hi> as a Civil War, or ſome great Invaſion by Foreign Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; in ſuch a Juncture they would do as they did in the War of <hi>Paris:</hi> they took up Arms, and reſpectively proteſted they were for the Kings Service; but if the Peace had not been ſoon made, they would not have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born to think themſelves neceſſary; and to make all the Propoſitions that they could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine advantageous to their party. They would have re-demanded their places of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; they would have preſs'd for a reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Temples, for an augmentation of their pretended Priviledges, and for a free exerciſe of their Religion: and, according to their good old cuſtom, have uttered Complaints
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:109071:27"/>
and Menaces. But if by ill chance a Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Army of Strangers, whether Catholicks or Religionaries, ſhould enter the Kingdom, the King muſt reſolve to ſee the Hereticks declare againſt him, or elſe content them in all their pretenſions, which would prove an engaging of his State in like Calamities, as our Fathers in their time ſaw.</p>
                     <p>It ought to be ordained, that they ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly follow their ancient Confeſſion of Faith which was permitted them in <hi>France;</hi> and that ſuch as vary from it, ſhall be no longer reckon'd in the number of thoſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Reformed Religion, who have Liberty of Conſcience given them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>Huguenots</hi> have no ground at all to plead the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> ſo loudly and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly as they do: they extorted it by violence, and with Sword in hand: yet was it but an <hi>Interim,</hi> an Order taken, until they ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves of the truth; which they have had time enough to do. But did they not violate it themſelves by the War of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedock,</hi> that other of <hi>Sevennes;</hi> and again by that of <hi>Rochelle?</hi> nay, they call'd the Enemies of the State unto their Succour, and took a courſe to bring Fire and Sword into all parts of the Kingdom. Shortly, in matter of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that which is good at one time, is frequently not ſo at another; all things muſt be accommodated to the general rule of Policy, which is, that the good of States be inceſſantly procured. When the Edict of Pacification was accorded, there was proviſion made for the welfare of <hi>France:</hi> if that welfare does
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:109071:27"/>
now require that the Edict be revoked, there is no remedy, revoked it muſt be, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
                     <p>From all this which I have ſaid it follows, that the King hath moſt juſt cauſe to ſecure himſelf from the Profeſſors of the Proteſtant Reformed Religion, and put them into ſuch a ſtate, as he may have nothing to apprehend from their particular. Perhaps it will be ſaid, that 'tis expedient there be <hi>Huguenots</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> becauſe they oblige the Church-men to ſtudy, and to live with the greater circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, and a more exact obſervance of the rules of their Profeſſion. But this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not worth the conſidering. The Church of GOD will never be ſupported by theſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane means. He is in the midſt of it, and governs it Himſelf by His Holy Spirit, which animateth and filleth it. At whatever time there ſhall be no more <hi>Huguenots</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> there will be fewer bad, and a greater number of good men; which the King ſhould particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly deſire; ſince States are always ſuſtained by people that love Virtue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It paſſeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for certain, that it is fit the King do diſable the Religionaties, as to their doing any harm, and as to their giving cauſe of ſuſpicion.</p>
                     <p>It remaineth to examine what way may moſt readily and moſt commodiouſly lead unto this end. I would not adviſe that theſe People of the other Religion ſhould be compell'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of <hi>France,</hi> as the <hi>Moors</hi> were out of <hi>Spain;</hi> which proved in the ſequel, ſo preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the whole Country. 'Twould be a piece of inhumanity to drive the <hi>Huguenots</hi> in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109071:28"/>
that manner: they are Chriſtians, though ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Body of the Church: beſides, this courſe would deprive the State of not a few good Families, and put the unhappy num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of e'm out of all hope of Converſion and Salvation: ſo that the King, in this concern, ſhould do well as ſeems to me, to imitate the Church, the common parent of all Chriſtians; who, in the Remedies She prepareth, ever mingleth mildneſs and Mercy, with Juſtice, and Compaſſion with Correction.</p>
                     <p>The firſt means then which the King might employ, ſhould be to provide, that the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi> might frequent the coverſation of the Catholicks with more familiarity than they do. For by this coverſation they would, in time, be undeceiv'd of the Opinion with which they are pre-poſſeſs'd, that we hate them; they would put off the Averſion they have for us; they would know our Deportment; and be informed of our Doctrine in the points that offend them; becauſe they underſtand not the Myſteries of them; which would induce them to confeſs, as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> did on the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, That the Church does not teach things as they once thought it did. Nothing is to my Underſtanding, or can be, more effectual for the Converſion of the Hereticks, than this fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Converſation; it is not poſſible, but that at length, the ſpirit of Men ſhould yield unto impreſſion; the plumage of the Eagle, 'tis ſaid, conſumes that of other Birds; Light diſſipates Darkneſs, Truth triumphs over Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond means ſhould be, to confer a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:109071:28"/>
of Honour upon Converts; and to make a Stock for this purpoſe, which might never fail. I ſhould think it would be none of the beſt courſe to exclude the <hi>Huguenots</hi> from all Employments; they muſt enter into leſſer Offices, though not at all into the greater. The reaſon is, becauſe if they be put off from all kind of publick buſineſs, they will accuſtom themſelves to tarry at home idle, and their ambition will be extinguiſh'd in ſuch ſort, as perhaps they will make it a point of Religion to do nothing; whereas being taken to ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Offices, they will habituate themſelves to a living among Catholicks, and their Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will awaken, when they ſhall compare themſelves with their Superiours.</p>
                     <p>The third means I offer is, to ſelect ſome particular Men, and create them ſuch buſineſs referring to Religion, as may conſtrain them to attend the Council, and keep following the Court. Buſineſs of that kind may be ſtarted to Gentlemen, upon the Exerciſe they have in their Houſes. There is not one of them but is obnoxious to a Proceſs in that caſe; and the Biſhops will, with joy, be the Proſecutors. Beſides, the King's Procureur (or Attorney) General is concern'd to know, whether Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, Baptiſms, and Burials, be ſolemniz'd with due accurateneſs in theſe private houſes; and whether good and faithful Regiſters of them be kept or no: Great defects herein being eaſily ſuppoſeable, the ſame will be juſt matter of complaint againſt the Owners, as negligent in obſerving the conceſſion made them, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Exerciſe in their Caſtles. The like may
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:109071:29"/>
be done, if others, contrary to the Edict, be admitted to theſe Preachings beſide the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks.</p>
                     <p>A Fourth means would be, to oblige the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligioniſts to put again in due ſtate the ancient Chappels of their Houſes, which they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh'd or prophan'd; the purſuance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ought to be by the diligence of each Biſhop in his Dioceſs. There muſt not be made a common affair of it to all the <hi>Huguenots</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but divers particulars only be fix'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And the thing it ſelf is as reaſonable as any. For they had no right to deſtroy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that had been all along deſtin'd to Divine Service, according to the Religion of the King, receiv'd by all the Kingdom, and alſo profeſs'd by our Progenitors.</p>
                     <p>The Fifth means is, that when an Affair of ſuch quality as I mention'd, comes before the Council, the Deputies which the <hi>Huguenots</hi> have at Court in the name of them all, be not permitted to intervene in it. There are 3 Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the putting by of theſe interventions: The Firſt is, that the <hi>Huguenots</hi> cannot conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Body in <hi>France,</hi> nor aſſemble without the Kings expreſs permiſſion. The Second, that Private and Particular affairs ought not to be ſet up in the rank of thoſe that are general and publick. The Third, that the King will do Juſtice without their intervention. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation ſhould not be all at once abrogated out-right; but no regard muſt be had to what the Deputies repreſent in the name of all the party.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth means ſhould be, that the King do
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:109071:29"/>
take effectual order the <hi>Huguenots</hi> may no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger have their dwellings, nor their Exerciſe in places not Royal; at leaſt ſuch as have any Lords of the Proteſtant Reformed Religion for Proprietors. As for Example, <hi>Vitrey</hi> in <hi>Bretan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> belongs to <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Prince <hi>de Tarante,</hi> who is of that Religion; and it belongs to him by a Demiſe made him of it by <hi>Monſieur de la Tremouille.</hi> The <hi>Huguenots</hi> have there a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and a Religious Exerciſe: this Town they muſt exchange, and have another for it given them; reaſons will not be wanting to colour ſuch permutations: there is nothing that may contribute more to their Converſion. For it will be an incredible diſpleaſure to them to live among people with whom they have no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, nor any Union, either by Intereſt or Blood.</p>
                     <p>A Seventh means is, to ſuppreſs by natural death, all <hi>Huguenot</hi> Counſellors. The Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Edict are now of no more uſe.</p>
                     <p>The Eighth is, to give them for their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods Catholick Commiſſaries; ſuch as are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what vers'd in the Controverſies, and have the skill to favour the Wranglings that are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually among them. Theſe Commiſſaries were heretofore all of them Catholicks. Particular Synods, when Petition'd for, muſt not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd them; but National ones ſhould never be granted: and at the cloſe of all their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donal Aſſemblies, Money ſhould be demanded of the Miniſters for the King's Affairs, by way of Loan or of Tenths, or under ſome other pretexts.</p>
                     <p>The Ninth means is, to get them proſecuted
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:109071:30"/>
for their common Debts, and ſo cauſe them to ſell, by Decree, ſome of their Temples, which ſure cannot be judged to be in Mortmain, or Un-alienable.</p>
                     <p>A Tenth is, to Prohibit that any Subject go out of the Kingdom without the King's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. For the <hi>Huguenots</hi> muſt not depart out of <hi>France;</hi> and they will be compris'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a general Prohibition.</p>
                     <p>The Eleventh is, to take order the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors may intimate to the poorer ſort of Catholicks, that it is a point of Conſcience to ſerve <hi>Huguenots.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Twelfth is, to oblige them on a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical account, unto an Abſtinence from Fleſh, upon thoſe days which the Catholicks do ſo obſerve, in like manner as they are already obliged to heed the Feſtivals, out of reſpect to the Publick Religion: then hereupon, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſh ſuch as ſhall tranſgreſs in the one or the other of theſe two things.</p>
                     <p>The Thirteenth means is, to endeavour the Marrying of Catholicks to the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and cauſe the Children iſſuing from ſuch Marriages, to be Educated in the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion.</p>
                     <p>A Fourteenth may be, to hinder the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi> from ſelling any Eſtate they have in Land: for this kind of poſſeſſion does tye them to the Intereſts of the State.</p>
                     <p>The Fifteenth and laſt, is, to change the place of that Academy which they have at <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi> and fix it in ſome other Town, as <hi>Vange,</hi> or <hi>Beaufort.</hi> There is a Preſident for ſuch a change in the Tranſlation of the like Academy from <hi>Montauban</hi> to <hi>Pullaurens.</hi> The pretext
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:109071:30"/>
for drawing them out of <hi>Saumur</hi> is, that this Town being a Paſs on the <hi>Loire,</hi> and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Communication of divers great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, the King cannot be too well ſecured of it: beſide, this planting an Academy at <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi> is an Uſurpation; the <hi>Huguenots</hi> having never had a Patent for it. It would ſignifie nothing, ſhould the <hi>Huguenots</hi> alledge, that they have it for a place of ſecurity: For they are now as the King's other Subjects be, who do not at all demand any. What would come of it, if all Collective Bodies ſhould demand pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Security? 'Tis a madneſs.</p>
                     <p>Further yet, it might be declared, That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, who aſpire to the Office of Miniſters, ſhould be obliged to teach a courſe of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, or two years in Theology. Thus there would be fewer Miniſters than there are; and at length, their number being diminiſhed, the number of <hi>Huguenots</hi> would infallibly diminiſh alſo. The King might likewiſe ordain, That the Proponents ſhould be examin'd in preſence of ſuch Commiſſioners as he ſhould pleaſe to appoint; to the end they might undergo a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Trial. For His Majeſty is concern'd, that theſe Miniſters be perfectly well ſtudied, left they prove promoters of Sedition, and not Paſtors. At the time of their Examination, the ſame Proponents ſhould be oblig'd to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all the Catholick Doctors in any contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſial queſtions they ſhould think fit to move. The <hi>Huguenots</hi> cannot refuſe this Propoſition; becauſe their Proponents ought to be prepared in all matters: and ſince the <hi>Huguenots</hi> affirm, that their Miniſters are their Biſhops, there
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109071:31"/>
muſt no perſon be a Miniſter who hath not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the Age of Twenty ſeven years at leaſt. Theſe are ſummarily the humane means that ſeem to me moſt conducible to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Profeſſors of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion.</p>

                        <p>1. What Nobility is. 2. Of the Nobles of <hi>France,</hi> of their Degrees, and the Ranks of Gentlemen. 3. Of the Orders of Knighthood. 4. In what reſpects Gentlemen may be uſeful to the King.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving examined what relates to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, the Firſt of the Three Orders that compoſe the Body Politick of <hi>France;</hi> it is time to ſpeak of the Second, which is that of the Nobility: Nobility is a Quality that renders the Poſſeſſors of it Generous, and ſecretly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſeth their Soul unto an affection for Honourable things. The Virtue of Anceſtors does make this excellent impreſſion of Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon perſons; and there is in ſeminal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I know not what ſpirituous and energeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Principle, that tranſmitteth and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the inclinations of Parents unto their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants: as is obvious to remark; not only in Men, and in all the Animals, which have a natural Generation; but alſo in Plants, and in things evidently moſt inanimate. This Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtral Virtue, verily, gives us the firſt tincture in order to a right Noble Accompliſhment;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:109071:31"/>
and every Man iſſued from great and illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Berſonages, does continually feel a kind of elaſtick impulſe in the ſecret receſſes of his Heart, which thruſts him on to imitate them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their Memory ſpurs him on to Glory, and brave Actions: but if through negligence, or the degeneracy of an ill nature, it ſo comes to paſs, that he anſwers not the hope which the Grandeur of his Progenitors gave ground to conceive of his Deportment; in this caſe, all the Luſtre of their Ancient Reputation which environ'd him from the inſtant of his Birth, and whether he will or no, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd him all along the courſe of his life, it does, I ſay, by making him be noted, for (<hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitas a noſcendo dicitur</hi>) but promote his ſhame, and the more conſpicuouſly ſhew his defects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the augmenting and juſtifying a contempt of his Perſon. Thus an actual Virtue is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for Gentlemen, that they may be able to bear up the weight of their condition, which otherwiſe preſſeth them quite down. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Rank and Honor of their Houſe is, the greater their Diſhonor; and ſo much the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that Precipice into which their diſſoluteneſs doth caſt them.</p>
                     <p>There are uſually noted three kinds of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. The Firſt is a Nobleneſs of Blood: when the ſource of a great extraction is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the obſcurity of a long ſucceſſion of years, and cannot now be diſcovered. This kind is in greateſt eſteem among Men: and indeed we call things that are left us of this quality, Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and do bear a ſort of Religious Reſpect to them: we are generally poſſeſs'd too with
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:109071:32"/>
a perſwaſion, that whatever is unknown, is full full of Myſteries; hence Objects of ſuch a nature are apt to ſurpriſe us; and we here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon are awed at them, and do admire them. Such effects, the greatneſs of an unſearchable high-deſcending Pedigree does produce. Nor need we much ſcruple to affirm, that this kind is the only proper and genuine Nobility; and that the Two others are only Nobilitations. What difference is made between a perſon No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and one Ennobled, is familiarly known. This firſt kind of Nobility is thought to require a poſſeſſion of the Virtue of Anceſtors, and withal, a poſſeſſion of their wealth; this too in ſo eſſential a manner, that if each of them be not joyntly poſſeſs'd, the Nobility is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct. We daily ſee proofs that evince the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and the Truth of this Notion. Be it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated by the way, that the Virtue here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd is the Military Art.</p>
                     <p>The Second kind of Nobility, is that which takes its riſe from Offices and eminent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, unto which the Laws have annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this mark of Honour.</p>
                     <p>The Third is acquir'd by the Prince's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which are called <hi>Letters of Nobilitation.</hi> It is a right peculiar to the Kind to give ſuch Letters; as the <hi>Roman Panegyriſt</hi> once ſaid to the Emperor <hi>Trajan.</hi> It belongs not but to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> to create a Nobility. It is for none but the King to Honour brave aud valiant Subjects with this Quality. This Third and laſt kind is leaſt conſidered: becauſe the Perſon who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it, hath not the Virtue of Anceſtors for a foundation and caution of his own. Yet it
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:109071:32"/>
is ſometimes more conſiderable than either of the two others; and <hi>Marius</hi> in <hi>Saluſt</hi> had great reaſon to tell the Gentlemen of <hi>Rome;</hi> that he had rather begin the Nobility of his Race, than faintly continue it, or unworthily loſe it; and that it was more Glorious for him to tranſmit to his Poſterity a ſparkling Virtue, hard to be follow'd, than plod ſlowly on upon the ſlight, and almoſt effaced tracks of a common Virtue which his Anceſtors had left him. In all theſe three kinds of Nobility, there muſt be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Virtue of the Perſon inveſted with 'em: for when all is done, it is but Virtue that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers effective worth.</p>
                     <p>All Nations have had a particular eſteem for Nobility, nor can any well-order'd Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth be named, which hath not invented ſome ſingular mark of Honour to make it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous. The <hi>French</hi> in this point, have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd and out-done all People upon Earth; as for the firſt, Antiquity, <hi>Caeſar</hi> obſerves, that the Nobles, that is, the Gentlemen, had among the <hi>Gauls,</hi> as much power over the <hi>Plebeians,</hi> as Maſters at <hi>Rome</hi> had over their Slaves. After <hi>Gaul</hi> was reduced to the State of a Province, Nobility preſerved its ancient Prerogatives; and the Emperors knowing, that the Nobles loved Glory, and ſought it above all things, ſtiled them <hi>Honorati,</hi> and gave them an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute precedency in all Aſſemblies of the <hi>Gauls.</hi> For the <hi>Romans</hi> had thought it neceſſary to weaken the Authority of the <hi>Druids.</hi> In the time of Chriſtianity the ſame Order was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued; and the Nobility gave their Suffrage apart in the Election of Biſhops, expreſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:109071:33"/>
the People; yea, even before the Clergy themſelves. Upon the declining of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the Gentlemen did, in <hi>France,</hi> judge the Cauſes of their equals; and hence, without doubt, came into uſe the Parliaments, Courts and Aſſemblies, which our Kings held of their Peers and Barons; that is, of the qualify'd Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of their Kingdom, when a Caſe of ſome Peer or Grandee of the State was to be Tried. The Nobles were diſtinguiſh'd anciently from <hi>Plebeians,</hi> by their Hair, which they wore long, for a mark of their ancient Liberty; and when any one of them committed a fault that was unbeſeeming his Birth, the reſt Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenc'd him to depart the Country, or cut off his Hair; This was therefore a no leſs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than Exile. In <hi>Charlemagne</hi>'s time, the Gentlemen of <hi>France</hi> named themſelves <hi>Franks,</hi> by way of Excellence. In fine, the <hi>French</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility hath alwavs had ſuch an high degree of Excellency, and ſo great a pre-eminence, that it was preferr'd in all Caſes; as when vacant Biſhopricks or Abbies were to be provided for; or when the principal Magiſtracy and Seats of Judicature were to be fill'd up, or the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of important Places, Warlike imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Leading of Armies, were to be diſpoled of. To conclude this Matter, it may be affirm'd, that Kings did take the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men into a partnerſhip with themſelves, as I may term it, in the Regality; they honour'd them with part of their Power, by conferring on them Fiefs, and by entruſting them with the charge of doing Juſtice, and of Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning Officers to that end.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:109071:33"/>Hereupon it was neceſſary to put a gradual difference between Gentlemen themſelves: nor is it indeed ſufficient that they all have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent Prerogatives above the vulgar, or common ſort, as we call them. For Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is alike in every Man, and all Men are Born equal. Fortune on the contrary, and Virtue, diſtinguiſh one from another. But na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon requires there be Order in all things. 'Tis Order that makes the Beauty and Symmetry of the Univerſe. Now as a Muſical Conſort doth not make a perfect har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but by a diverſity of Notes; ſo a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical State can be neither comely nor compleat, unleſs there be a difference between the parts that compoſe it. I know that Nobility, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Philoſophers call it, an Inherent Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, does lodge with its whole Eſſence, in each of its Subjects: As the quality of a Soldier is, for its Eſſence, in the perſon of a Corporal, as well as of a Captain or General Officer. Yet there is a great diſtance, and many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening degrees, between a General and the meaneſt Muſquetier in an Army. Thus the meaneſt Gentleman in the Kingdom is Noble; and to ſpeak after the common Proverb, is Noble as well as the King; but the one is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the other by an immenſe gradua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So, though all Gentlemen be equal in Nobility, yet they are not ſo in Riches, in Lands, in Alliance, in Friends, in Offices, in Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in Age, and in Reputation. Again, they are not equal in Spirit, in Knowledge, in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, nor in Wiſdom; therefore it hath been with much prudence ordered, that they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:109071:34"/>
ſhould have ſome external marks of theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; and for this end, there have been crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Princes, Dukes, Counts, Marqueſſes, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, Knights, Batchelers, Eſquires; leave hath been given them to bear Helmets and Crowns upon their Armories: In ſhort, no pains have been ſpared to find out things that might any way adorn their Quality; and their Valour hath been publickly rewarded, for an excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others to a generous emulation.</p>
                     <p>Here, I cannot forbear to blame thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who give themſelves the Title of Knights, of Marqueſſes, or of Counts, by their own private Authority. This is a ſhameful Uſurpation; and ſo far from heightening the Luſter of Nobility, that it injures them. For a Gentleman who takes upon him the quality of a Marqueſs, and well knows he is none, makes a perpetual Lye, a thing directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Honour, and to the profeſſion he makes, of being a devoted conſtant defender of Truth. Beſide, this huge number of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes, Lords and Knights, does bring thoſe Qualities into contempt; and is a cauſe, that true Marqueſſes are not conſidered now, as they of right ought to be. 'Tis therefore extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly important, that proviſion be ſpeedily made in the caſe. For this confuſion deſtroys the uſefulneſs of thoſe Dignities, they being ſuch as his Majeſty ſhould keep in his own hand, and Husband them with deliberation and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality; that they might be diſtributed on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to Men of Honour, and ſuch as have evidenced a Zeal for his Service, and for the good of his Kingdom; that the perſons alſo
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:109071:34"/>
to whom they are Granted, might fully enjoy them, with all the advantages and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that are by cuſtom annexed to them. I will not omit, that it is neceſſary to give the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the greateſt reſpect that may be; to the end, that Citizens may conceive the greater deſire to become Gentlemen; which ſhould be granted them, when they have rais'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a Worthineſs of it, either by juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a remarkable Eſtate, or doing ſome il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious exploit in War.</p>
                     <p>The whole Conſtitution of the Nobility is Military: Nevertheleſs there have been inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in <hi>France,</hi> particular Orders of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, of which, the King is Grand Maſter Himſelf; and into which He admitteth ſuch Gentlemen as He accounts moſt worthy of it. Such are the Orders of the Holy Ghoſt, and of <hi>St. Michael.</hi> There are others, of which the King is barely Protector; The Order of <hi>S. Lazarus</hi> is of that nature. But this is of no great advantage to the State: Becauſe all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficences, all Favours, all Honours and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, ſhould come directly and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the Hand and Bounty of the King. For the continuation therefore of this Order of <hi>S. Lazarus,</hi> His Majeſty might unite the Grand Maſterſhip of it to the Regality, as the King of <hi>Spain</hi> does.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>MY beginning to Treat of the Three Orders of the Body Politick of <hi>France,</hi> as the Clergy and the Nobility, leaving the Third Eſtate to be laſt ſpoken of, is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod like theirs, who having ſome Edifice to examine, do begin at the top; and ſettle to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the upper Stories, before they look on the Foundations. In truth, the People are the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis upon which all Republiques have their ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 'Tis they that manure the Ground, and cauſe it to bear Fruit. 'Tis they that pay the Subſidies; that breed Workmen, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Merchants. Yet that which we call the Third Eſtate, does not conſiſt of Peaſants, or the meer rural ſort; 'Tis principally the Freemen, and Communalties of Towns, and Officers of Juſtice, that compoſe it. This Third Eſtate was not called to the General Aſſemblies of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> either in the time of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or during the Firſt and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Race of our Kings; it was well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the Third before they had that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge. I believe, not until the Reign of <hi>Philip the Fair.</hi> But it is not upon this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I am now to inſiſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:109071:35"/>However, in ſpeaking of the Third Eſtate, the whole Popular body is to be conſider'd; and it may be divided into three parties of men; namely, Husbandmen, Artificers, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. Of the Officers of Juſtice we will ſpeak in the next Chapter. The leaſt-infected, and beſt party of the People, is the Husband-men that daily labour; which takes up their Heads and Hands, all the year long without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, keeps them in ſimplicity and obedience. There cannot be too great a number of 'em; eſpecially not in <hi>France,</hi> by reaſon of the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the Country; and our Corn being Tranſported into Foreign parts, we ought to make great Stores of it, and have as much as may be in a readineſs. Exact care muſt be taken, that theſe Men may always be in a condition to take pains: and that they have but little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Townſmen, whoſe little labour, and other manners, might corrupt their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. And, that Eaſe and Plenty do not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them inſolent. For there is nothing more dangerous and inſufferable, than a ſort of rich Peaſants. No leſs care muſt be taken, that an extream penury do not reduce them to extream miſery. For too great Poverty lying on them, they no longer have either Men or Cattle: they are ty'd up to ill Diet, lodge on the ground: ſuffer Hunger and Cold: their Children periſh for want of Food; there are Epidemical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes bred among them; they are not ſuccour'd; they dye away: by this means the Country is diſpeopled; and being void of Inhabitants, the Grounds are unhusbanded, and abandoned. When I ſhall come to diſcourſe of the Finances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:109071:36"/>
I will point out a way to preſerve Country-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a moderately-commodious Eſtate: at preſent I will only ſay, that it would be to very good purpoſe to create a Superintendant of Husbandry; who ſhould have his Eye on thoſe affairs, and ſee, that the Grounds be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, Vineyards well kept, and Meadows fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordered: in like manner as there are Maſters of Waters, and Foreſts, who take care that the Woods be not damnifi'd; and Surveyors for the High-ways; and in fine, Jurats for every Craft.</p>
                     <p>The Second party of the Popular order, is the Handicrafts-men, or Artificers; theſe are no leſs uſeful to the State than any other. For, beſides that Manufactures do keep men at work, and engage them; they are the cauſe that the Silk, the Wool, the Skins, the Flax, the Timber, and the other Commodities that grow in <hi>France,</hi> are made uſe of; and that Country People have the means to barter theſe things, and put them off; eſpecially being wrought into Wares not made in Foreign parts, we ſhall grow to be further principal Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturers, as we already are of Hats for <hi>Spain,</hi> and Stuffs for all <hi>Europe:</hi> which is a matter of exceeding great conſequence: and in proceſs of time, when the work is once on foot, things will paſs from hand to hand, and oft-times go out of the Kingdom. All this quickens Trade, and makes Money paſs to and fro: which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteth the Publick, and therewithall at once, every ones private welfare.</p>
                     <p>'Tis not enough to have Husband-men and Artificers in a Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there muſt of neceſſity
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:109071:36"/>
be Merchants alſo: for without their Induſtry, the Artificers Shops would be Stores never emptied; the Granaries would remain full of Corn; and the Cellars, of Wines; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be gone. We will more largely treat of this, when we come to the Article of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>

                     <p>IF men were entirely juſt to one another, and each of 'em (in the phraſe of one of the greateſt <hi>Greek</hi> Philoſophers) a Law unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; there would need neither Law nor Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to keep them in perfect tranquility. But Nature being corrupted, we no longer conſult that Original Righteouſneſs, which is inſeparable from reaſon, and which without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion, inwardly preſſeth us to render to all their due, as exactly, as we would ſhould be done to ourſelves.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:109071:37"/>
We equally uſe fraud and force to content our injuſtice and irregular deſires. Whereupon it hath been commodiouſly done by wiſe Men, to form, as may be ſaid, a new reaſon, which they called Law. But becauſe Laws are of no uſe, except they be armed with Correction to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſuch as deſpiſe them; and have ſome ſoul, and living principle; therefore Magiſtrates have been created<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who are to pronounce the Oracles which thoſe Laws inſpire, to put the Laws in Execution, and maintain the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of them. Theſe Officers are choſen of the beſt and moſt intelligent Men in a State; and if Common-wealths be duly regulated; ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily the Rich are preferred before the Poor, and Nobles before <hi>Plebeians;</hi> becauſe 'tis ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed they have a greater meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and virtue; and by conſequence are leſs capable of certain mean things, in which a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous condition, and a mean extraction, might engage them. Thus Miniſters of Juſtice in <hi>France,</hi> call'd <hi>Men of the Robe,</hi> are in truth neceſſary in Publick Society. For if there was no evil-doer, Laws and Magiſtrates would be of no more uſe, than Joyners, and the Doors they make for the ſecurity of Houſes, if there were no Thieves: whereas, ſhould not a Man in a whole Kingdom ever ſwerve from right reaſon and pure equity; there muſt neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs be Prieſts for Religion; Soldiers for defence againſt Foreign Invaſions that might happen; and People who may ſome of 'em Till the Ground; others apply themſelves to Trades and Manufactures, that Men cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. So that theſe three ſorts of Perſons are
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:109071:37"/>
inſeparable from a Common-wealth; and they make up the Three Eſtates we have ſpoken of, which have been receiv'd without any conteſt.</p>
                     <p>Yet it ſeems, that of late, the Parliaments have ſought to infuſe into ſome green heads, that they compos'd a Fourth Order in the Kingdom; and the ſame, not only diſtinct from the other Three, but altogether ſuperiour to them, by reaſon of their Sovereignty, and of the Power they have to deliberate upon the pleaſure and Edicts of the King. If they ſhould not be brought off from this opinion, perhaps they would draw the other Sovereign Courts and Officers of Judicature into the ſame Error; an Union of them all not being deniable: becauſe otherwiſe the affair of Juſtice would in <hi>France,</hi> form two bodies; which may not be. But from allowing this Fourth Body in the State, namely that of Juſtice, a ridiculous inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would follow; to wit, that a Sergeant (or Catchpole) of a Village, would be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a body ſuperior to that of the Nobility; and by conſequence, in ſome ſort, ſuperior to a Marquis. For in matter of Hierarchy, the laſt of a more excellent Order, is greater than the firſt of a leſs excellent one: as the loweſt of the Arch-Angels, is greater than the higheſt of the Angels.</p>
                     <p>But to clear the difficulty before us, it muſt be remembred, that heretofore in <hi>France,</hi> the Eſtates which were called Parliaments, did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble twice a year for two conſiderations: one was, to judge of Appeals, that were made from judgments paſs'd by inferior Officers. The other, to give the King Counſel when
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:109071:38"/>
He demanded their Opinion about Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the State. For alway, during the firſt and ſecond Race, the King's did diſpoſe of Publick Affairs, as of Peace and War; and this is ſo much a truth, that if thoſe ancient Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments had had the diſpoſing of the State, they would never have ſuffered, that the Children of <hi>Lewis,</hi> when they had divided the Kingdom among them, ſhould have fallen to make War one upon another; which could tend to nothing but a publick deſolation. They would as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle have permitted the enmities of <hi>Brize, Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det,</hi> and <hi>Fredegonde.</hi> In like manner under the Second Race, they would not have endured that the Sons of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Mild, ſhould act ſuch outrages on their Father, that <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald ſhould have given <hi>Neuſtria</hi> to the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> In the Third Race, that <hi>Lewis</hi> the Groſs ſhould have ruin'd ſo many great Lords; who made up the greateſt-part of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: that <hi>Lewis</hi> the Younger ſhould have yielded up <hi>Guienne</hi> by the Divorce of <hi>Eleanore:</hi> that the Count of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Britannie,</hi> and ſome others, ſhould have leagu'd together againſt Queen <hi>Blanche.</hi> In fine, there are thouſand and a thouſand examples in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do evidence that theſe Kings always had the free and Sovereign adminiſtration of their State: nor will there one be found to prove, that the Parliaments ever contradicted them. They preſented themſelves at the feet of their Princes, with Petitions, and humble Remonſtrances: they made no reſiſtance, nor exercis'd Authority. So that our King's have been King's indeed, always abſolute Maſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:109071:38"/>
and for proof hereof, it will be ſufficient to look into all the Statutes; there it may be ſeen how they ſpake, and what part the Eſtates had in them. The principal end of Parliaments therefore was, to the end the Law-ſuits of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons; and people perceiving that Appeals brought to them were received, and ſentences invalidated; many, to try Opinions in their caſes once again, became Appellants: by this means affairs were multiply'd; and that conteſting parties might not have the trouble to come up from the remoteſt parts of the Kingdom, Deputies of the General Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were appointed, they alſo ſtiled Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to be ambulatory. The Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they had, was ſometimes for three Months, ſometimes for ſix, according to exigence of State; but alway by the Command and Letters of the King. Theſe Parliaments went into the Provinces, to judge the cauſes that were brought them; almoſt in like manner as we now ſee done at the Extraordinary Seſſions: which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of diminiſhing the number of Cauſes to be diſpatch'd, as had been conceiv'd, really augmented them. <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Fair</hi> ſaw cauſe to make ſuch a Parliament ſedentary at <hi>Paris,</hi> another at <hi>Rouen,</hi> a third at <hi>Thoulouſe;</hi> and ſucceeding Kings eſtabliſh'd others in other Cities, as they are at preſent. From this faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful account it reſulteth, that the Parliaments are not a Fourth Body in the State; but be extracted out of the Three ancient Orders; at firſt they were taken out of the Clergy and Nobility only: becauſe the Commons at that time were not conſiderable afterwards, Theſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:109071:39"/>
alſo were received in. Other Sovereign Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties are but Images of theſe Parliaments. As to the Sovereignty of the Parliaments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it neither is, nor ever was other, than an emination of the Sovereignty of the King, in whom that Quality is natural, and indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The Parliaments can pretend to no more than His Majeſty may pleaſe to impart to them.</p>
                     <p>The Sale of Offices of Judicature having been introduc'd, there follow'd divers creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of new Officers, both in matter of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, and alſo in that of Juſtice: among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, thoſe of Preſidial Courts were inſtituted: which perhaps was done, only out of a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary intereſt; a needleſs degree of Jariſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being thereby ſet up, and ſuch a one as tendeth to the involving and oppreſſion of the Kings Subjects. Theſe Courts are ſo many petty Parliaments, in judging ſupreamly, and finally in ſome caſes: yet by the trick of Petty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fogging Practice, ways are found to get Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals from judgment paſs'd, to be received, and new proceſſes begun, to the vexation and undoing of the parties concern'd. There have been in all times, chief Judges in Towns; as Bailiffs and Seneſchals; a thing of indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible neceſſity for keeping the People in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: all the fault that can be found in it, is by reaſon of their number, which certainly is exceſſive.</p>
                     <p>'Tis not enough that the King hath Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and other Officers to determinate differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>among His Subjects: there muſt alſo be a Counſel about His Majeſty; by whoſe Advice, He may correct all ill Adminiſtration of Juſtice;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:109071:39"/>
may reverſe all Sentences given againſt the Mind and Intention of the Statutes; and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Order through the whole extent of His State. This Counſel is the <hi>Sacrarium</hi> of the Monarchy: and the perſons admitted into it, who may juſtly be ſtiled the Eyes, the Ears and Hands of the Prince) ought to have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Knowledge in Affairs, acquired by long and approved Experiences: They muſt love the Kingdom, the Kingly Power, and the King's Perſon. They are the Seminary, whence are taken Intendants of Provinces, Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors and Miniſters for Negotiations with Strangers. The Counſel is compos'd at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Gownmen only. It would not be much amiſs, nay, on the contrary, it would be very well done: if the King pleaſed to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this Honour unto other Profeſſions, when there were found Perſons capable of it: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Preference gives the Gentlemen of the Long Robe too much Authority; whereas there is need of retrenching what they have already; much rather, than of conferring any new advantage upon them, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter. As for the Royal Privy Council, in which Secret Affairs are debated, and which ought to be of very few Perſons, that Matters may be kept in ſilence, and not untimouſly divulged; I will not ſpeak of it in this place; nor ſay, in what manner it ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: becauſe this depends upon the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Maſter of it; and each King takes a different courſe in it. There have been Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces who committed the principal Care of all Affairs to one ſingle perſon: and <hi>France</hi> hath
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:109071:40"/>
ſeen, for inſtance, the Cardinals of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> and <hi>Richlieu.</hi> Others have parted Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſhared them among as many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as there were different Affairs. So did King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth. This, in my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was the more wiſely done; for that in matter of Government, the great Secret is to divide Authority, and hold the ballance even between a plurality of Perſons. Hiſtory teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us of what conſequence it was to our Kings of the firſt Race; that they had but one Maire of the Palace; and how dear it coſt their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Upon a like reaſon of State the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors divided the charge of the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Prefect. But Miniſters, whatever for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, muſt for qualification, be Men of Virtue and approved ſufficiency: They likewiſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> ought to be reprehended and puniſh'd for all that the King does amiſs, and contrary to Law.</p>
                     <p>The incredible number of the Miniſters of Juſtices in <hi>France,</hi> is in truth, ſomewhat mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous; Neither is there any diſorder in the State, more preſſing, or requiring a more ſpeedy Application of the Royal Authority. The truth is, if a Man conſider this multitude of Magiſtrates, will he not have ground to ſay, that the <hi>French</hi> are extream hard to be governed, ſeeing ſo many great Perſonages are employed in Governing them? Again, it may be ſaid, That this Nation, ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Illuſtrious by the Glory of its Actions, and by ſo many Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries wherewith its Arms have been honoured, is yet incapable of virtuous Inclinations; ſince there is need of force to reduce them to the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:109071:40"/>
rule of the Laws: though GOD never gave Men a more precious Preſent. On the other hand, can it be affirmed, that our Legiſlators wanted Wiſdom, or did not ſufficiently ſhew it in making the Laws? Yet if reflection be made upon the multitude of Law-ſuits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the vexation is a grievance to the Kingdom, may not a Man perſwade himſelf, that Equity is baniſh'd thence, and Upright dealing utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcarded? Should it then hereupon be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for granted, that the private ſort in <hi>France</hi> are not good condition'd People; can it be imagin'd that the Publick Government is any thing reaſonable and proper for its due ends? But if a Man proceed to penetrate further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Internals of the State, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what a deſolation the corrupting of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice hath made, looſning and breaking the moſt Sacred ties of Friendſhip; in fine, if he obſerve how the Monarchy hath often been in danger of ſubverſion, will he not wonder that the Publick Fortune hath held out, and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies been born up in the Storms that have ſo many times turmoild them?</p>
                     <p>The exceſſively great multitude of Officers, being the principal cauſe whence ſo many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs take their riſe; the remedy muſt be firſt apply'd thereto. And this remedy is nothing elſe, but ſuch a retrenchment as is expedient, or, to ſay better, neceſſary to be made. The fewer Officers of Juſtice there are, the more Soldiers and Artificers, and Merchants, and the fewer litigious Actions will be. For it is manifeſt that buſineſs of that kind has ever multiply'd, as the number of Officers hath been
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:109071:41"/>
augmented: in like manner, as the more Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, the more Patients. To arrive at the end propos'd, it would be convenient, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mature deliberation upon the eſtate of <hi>France,</hi> the number of its Inhabitants, and the quantity of Law-buſineſs, it be adviſedly ſtated in the King's Council, what number of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were fit to be reſerved, and of what qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity they ſhould be; then that the reſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd gradually, as the perſons dye away, or at once by a Declaration. What, in my opinion, might particularly be done, is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Preſidial Courts being compos'd of Officers that are needleſs to the State, a charge unto the People; having alſo but a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel interloping Juriſdiction, the fruit of an evil Counſel given to King <hi>Henry</hi> II. and a mere invention to get Money; the extinction of them is not to be doubted of; but effected by a ſubſtraction of the Officers Annuities. By this means the King will ſave that Pay, which amounts unto a Sum conſiderable to the State; and the Royal Juriſdictions, each in its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct, may do what thoſe Preſidials, upon which they depend, are wont to do. The Preſidial Clerks place, its being engaged, (or bound for ſecurity to one or other) as is uſual, ſhould not hinder the execution of this. Aflair: And when by deceaſe there are no more Officers left, care ſhall be taken of the concern of thoſe to whom the places were engaged, the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating whereof will by that time have no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:109071:41"/>Secondly, Of Sergeants, Two Thirds whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt be ſuppreſs'd.</p>
                     <p>In the Third place, all Proctors, that are not Advocates; and a certain number of Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates ſhould be appointed in each Parliament and Juriſdiction, who might do the Office of Proctors. This is not incompatible. For the thing is already in uſe many parts of <hi>France.</hi> The benefit of this regulation is manifeſt; in that the Proctors are very ignorant that have but a ſlight tincture of practice; yet out of Covetouſneſs they often draw up Writings for their Clients, and make them pay as dear for 'em, as if the beſt Advocate had taken the pains. Mean time theſe Writings, for the moſt part, are nothing worth; and the poor Suitors frequently loſe good Cauſes, through the naughtineſs of their Proctors, and for want of being well defended. Again, ſuch an order taken, another advantage would accrue, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Advocates being Proctors, they will be obliged to follow what the Judges ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them; whereas at preſent they make a jeſt of it, and will not Plead but when they pleaſe. There cannot be a regulation made in <hi>France</hi> more profitable in matter of Juſtice; and if the King, in a neceſſity of State, would make a Money matter of it, which might at any time be done, there would be rais'd out of it, for all <hi>France,</hi> more than 20 Millions. But it had need be gone about with a great deal of Addreſs. A Third advantage by this regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is, That all Advocates being Proctors, there would no more ſlip into the Court a ſort of young Men, who ſhelter their Ignorance
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:109071:42"/>
and Idleneſs under a Lawyers Gown and a ſquare Cap.</p>
                     <p>In the Fourth place, All the Maſters of Requeſts belonging to the Palace, or Court (of Juſtice) of <hi>France,</hi> ſhould be ſuppreſt. And the Truth is, it ſeems to me a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that theſe Officers ſhould be Counſellors of Supreme Courts, yet not impowred to judge any thing ſupreamly. But that the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the King's Houſhold and other privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged perſons, may not be depriv'd of the benefit of the <hi>Committimus,</hi> Power muſt be given them by ſpecial priviledge, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence their Actions, and proſecute them in a Chamber of Enqueſts. I ſay, by ſpecial pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, becauſe I know the Parliaments take no cognizance ordinarily, ſave of Appeals: but in the caſe now expres'd, this ſpecial pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge ſhall ſuperadd to them this new kind of Juriſdiction. And it will be highly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to thoſe Commoners and Priviledg'd perſons; for by this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Expedient they would get a decree ſpeedily upon one Trial, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally end their buſineſs. It is to be noted here, that the firſt ſtating of Caſes, in order to an Hearing, is not ſo incompetent to Parliaments, but that they do the thing for ſubſtance, upon demands incidentally made. Yet this is meant only in behalf of priviledged perſons, and all ſuch as claim the right of a <hi>Committimus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The Judges Provoſts of Towns are to be ſuppreſs'd, and they laid to the Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchalſies and Bayliwicks. For, what are ſo many different Officers in one and the ſame Town good for?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:109071:42"/>In a Sixth place, All the Courts of the Aids ſhould be united to the Parliaments; and this done, when the Officers of the Supream Court in each kind, have been reduc'd to the number which its judged meet to retain. I will ſay more of this in the Chapter of the <hi>Finances.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seventhly, All the Elections are to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, and the Aſſeſſing of Pariſhes, done by the Treaſurers of <hi>France;</hi> of the Seneſchalſies, by the Lieutenant of the Province. I ſhall ſpeak more plainly of it in the Chapter of the Finances and Taxes. Where alſo the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Store-houſes of Salt, and of the Gabells, ſhall be treated of in the Article of Gabells. Beſides, the Chamber of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, and the Court of Moneys, ſhould be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Chamber of Accompts; and half of all the Chambers be ſuppreſs'd likewiſe. For thirty Officers may do all that the Chamber of Accompts, the Treaſury, and the Court of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies now do, In fine, it is for the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and the good of the State, that all the Preſidents Places be ſuppreſs'd, as well thoſe of Superior Courts, as of others: and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Preſidents be diſcharged by Commiſſion. 'Tis to be conſider'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this new Order would much augment the King's Authority. For what will not Counſellors do to obtain a Commiſſion to preſide? and having obtained it, what will they not further do to keep and confirm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in it? 'Tis pertinent to recall to mind here, that the Mighty Prince <hi>Philip the Fair,</hi> at his making the Parliament Sedentary, made the Count of <hi>Burgundy</hi> firſt Preſident of it. And that anciently, the firſt Preſident of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:109071:43"/>
of Accompts was the chief Butler of <hi>France:</hi> Likewiſe, that at that time, and long after, the Chancellors of <hi>France</hi> were of the Church, or of the Sword; and great Dignities not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Men of the Robe privatively. Which being done ſince, without doubt gives them too much credit, and leaves the Nobility too little. It is important that the thing be not continued, but on the contrary, all reſtored to Primitive Order. As for Country Courts, 'tis fit they be narrowly limited, and brought to be meerly predial and dominial; that is, for Rents and the Fealties of Lordſhips: not capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining an Inventory, or receiving a ſuit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween parties, for more than three Livres. To conclude, the ſhortning of proceedings in Law, would much conduce to the reduction of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>
                     <p>Let it not be objected, that this reduction of Officers, and ſuch a multitude of Suppreſſions, will ruin a multitude of Families. For though it were ſo, yet ſhould not the thing be ſtuck at; the Reformation of a State being concern'd: nor is the ill of particular perſons to be put to accompt, when the Weal of the Publick is in queſtion, GOD Himſelf, who is King of Kings, and Eternally Juſt, how many men did He deſtroy by that univerſal deluge for the Reformation of the Univerſe? How many <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> did He cut off in the Wilderneſs, to ſave the groſs of the People? There is plenty of examples in this kind, and Soveraigns have a right to do like things with like Juſtice, when the general welfare of their Subjects is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. Kings are Eagles, to whom GOD
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:109071:43"/>
gives His Thunder-bolts to carry: the ſtrokes that come from their hands do come from the hand of GOD, whoſe Images and Inſtruments they are.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, it's a thing which cannot be diſſembled, that the Parliaments, conſtituting an Ariſtocratick Government in part, as they do, are quite contrary to Monarchick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Ariſtocracy is adverſe to Regality; becauſe of all Governments it comes neareſt to it. As, to uſe the very terms of <hi>Heſiod,</hi> a Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter envies, and is againſt a Potter. Be it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred here briefly, that <hi>Theopompus</hi> King of <hi>Sparta</hi> having created the <hi>Ephori,</hi> at laſt after a great deal of time, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> was fain to put them to death; when they had ſlain King <hi>Agis.</hi> The Senate becoming too potent, overthrew the firſt <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, and in one word, what hath our Age ſeen in the trial of <hi>Chenailles?</hi> and what did a former in that of Chancellor <hi>Poyet?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A ſecond ſource from which the Evils of litigious ſuits do ariſe, is the ſale of Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. The Emperor <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> ſound this miſchief in his Empire; it having been introduced by <hi>Domician.</hi> S. <hi>Lewis</hi> ſaw cauſe to weed the abuſe out of His Kingdom; it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got in through the confuſion and trouble of ſome precedent Reigns. It will be glorious for the King to do in His State what the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Severus</hi> and S. <hi>Lewis</hi> did in theirs, with greateſt glory to their Memory. But as Policy requires, that in ſuch enterpriſes, way be made by degrees, and greateſt events brought on by ſmall beginnings: ſo it is neceſſary here, to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:109071:44"/>
proceed leiſurely, and with meaſured ſteps. The fixation of Offices hath been much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced already: for though what hath been done ſeemed to ſignifie an authorizing the ſale of them: yet in truth, there hath been ground gotten. To continue the work, and bring it to perfection, there muſt a Decree paſs, or a Declaration be made, and publiſh'd at the Seal, by which the King declares, that he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth no longer to admit any oppoſition in matter of Title to Offices. This is juſt; for the King ought to be ever Maſter, and have the liberty to beſtow the charges of His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom on whom he pleaſeth, and thinks worthy of 'em. Thus no one will be alarm'd: but this Declaration will extend unto the price it ſelf, by a conſequence eaſily deducible; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſince the principal and eſſential right to Offices conſiſteth in the Title, and the price is but an acceſſory, as they term it: 'tis reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the price alway follow the Law of the Title: as the Title to a Benefice brings in the Revenue of it; And as in Marriage, the Validity of the Sacrament makes the Validity of the Contract, and of the civil effects. Thus receiving no more oppoſition at the Seal for the Title; there neither will be any in reference to the price: and hence it will come to paſs, in tract of time, that Offices will be no longer ſecurity for Money; which will diminiſh the price of them, and inſenſibly bring it to nothing. But it is very juſt too, that the Mortgaging of Offices, as hath been done hitherto, be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed for the future. For the Officer may dye before he hath paid the <hi>Paulette;</hi> whereby his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:109071:44"/>
Office is extinct; or if of Grace the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives it, the value of what ariſeth from the caſualty, is much leſs than the ſum for which the thing was engag'd: ſo that there muſt loſs certainly accrue. But if the King make a new creation of an Officer, all engagements are gone: for 'tis then no longer the Office that formerly it was.</p>
                     <p>Let it not be ſaid, that without the Sale of Offices, the Caſualties will be worth the King nothing. For the contrary is true: and if the Caſualties be worth Him Two Millions, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that ſale of them, His Majeſty will make Four Millions of 'em, if they be no longer ſaleable. Foraſmuch as in this Caſe, they will be no longer Hereditary; and being no more Hereditary, they will revert to the King upon the deceaſe of every Titulary: and ſo the King may diſpoſe of 'em in favour of the Perſon that is moſt acceptable to Him, and if it pleaſe His Majeſty, the new admitted Officer may fine to the Coffers of His Treaſury Royal, as the Officers of Gentlemen do to the profit of the Monaſticks. As to the Objection, that by ſuch ſuppreſſion of Officers and Juriſdictions, and taking away the ſale of Offices, the King will loſe the Revenue of many of His Clerks places, and of the <hi>Paulette;</hi> The Anſwer is eaſie; for as to the Clerks places ſuppreſs'd, the King will be recompenc'd by the greater value of thoſe that ſhall remain; and as for the <hi>Paulette,</hi> the retrenchment of the wages of the Officers ſuppreſs'd, will be much more conſiderable.</p>
                     <p>A third cauſe of vexatious Law-driving is, that Offices of Judicature are gainful to thoſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:109071:45"/>
that execute them. An evil this, the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſeſt of any that can affect a State; for all becomes ſuſpected, all becomes corrupt where profit is to be made; Avarice and Ambition creep in; Juſtice, Uprightneſs, and Truth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part: whereupon we may conclude with the ancient Proverb, <hi>That Money doth many things which the Devil cannot do.</hi> For an entrance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Reformation in this matter, it would be good to ordain, Firſt, That Judges not the Kings, ſhould take no more Spices. Secondly, That Judges in the Royal Courts ſhould not decree Executions for their attendance againſt the parties that are in conteſt. Thirdly, That if Spices, (or Fees upon ſentence obtained) be allowed, the parties ſhall give what they will, as the former cuſtom was, and not be compelled. Fourthly, That there be no more tranſacting by Commiſſaries in Sovereign Courts.</p>
                     <p>Judges ſhould be forbidden to admit any ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation from parties at Law, even though it be but to let them know the difficulties of their Affairs, and put them in a way to clear the ſame. For a Judge ought not to be prayed to do his Office, in favour of a man whoſe caſe is good, much leſs of one whoſe caſe is bad.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>1. Of ſome general Orders in Government. 2. Of puniſhment and recompence. 3. Of Royal Virtues.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the Chapters now diſpatch'd, I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted many things which may be of uſe for the Kings ſervice, for the general good of His State, and of every of His Subjects in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. In the Chapters that are to follow, others very conſiderable ſhall be added. However, I judge it not amiſs to make here a diſtinct Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſome important points, which I cannot eaſily rank any other where.</p>
                     <p>It hath been long in diſpute, whether it be good to alter Publick Laws? and upon debate of the Queſtion to and fro, 'tis concluded, that there is oft-times ſo preſſing a neceſſity, that it cannot be forborn: but withal, that ſuch alterations muſt be inſenſible to the People, who hardly come off from old Cuſtoms; and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be brought to any new obſervance, but by a long circumference, and ways to them unknown. Legiſlators are Phyſicians of Common-wealths, and in this caſe ought to imitate the ordinary Artiſts of that Profeſſion, who ſeeing the whole habit of a body out of order, and that to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Patient from Periſhing, 'tis neceſſary to change it, do preſcribe remedies, which the more ſlowly they operate, the ſurer their effect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:109071:46"/>Now the firſt Law, which in my Opinion might be made, or rather renewed in <hi>France,</hi> is to baniſh thence all Uſuries, of whatever quality, except among Merchants; and thoſe ſhould be expreſly prohibited, which ariſe from perſonal Obligations, under pretence of dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and intereſts; even intereſts adjudged by ſentence not excluded; this pretence being but a means to authorize Uſury, and defraud the Law, which forbids it. Uſury was ſtrictly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited among the ancient Inhabitants of <hi>Candie:</hi> but the coveting of Riches, to elude the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Statute, diſpoſed the borrower, that he ſhould ſeem to have ſtollen the Money he had need of, and which in reality was lent him. By this Artifice the Debtor was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to pay the Intereſts; which were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to the Creditor on the account of any Loan, but in hatred of Robbery, which he ſaid had been committed upon him. This means cannot be uſed in <hi>France;</hi> for that Theft is there a capital Crime, both in Religion and in Policy. But the Spirit of Man being unbounded, and having more craft when bent to tranſgreſs, than the Law hath prudence to hinder evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the taking of damages and intereſts hath been introduced amongſt us; which is an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the <hi>Cretan</hi> expedient. For the feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a detenſion of Money againſt the owners will, as is done in <hi>France,</hi> and the Debtor thereupon condemn'd to pay the Intereſts, can be no other thing for ſubſtance, than the feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Robbery, as was done in <hi>Candie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is not any Nation of note, in which Uſurious Contracts have not been prohibited
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:109071:46"/>
among the Subjects. 'Tis known what the Law of the Church in this behalf is, and what that of the Old Teſtament, ſo often repeated in Scripture, was. Uſury ſure, hath cauſed the greateſt diſorders that have hitherto troubled the tranquility of States. The <hi>Athenians,</hi> the <hi>Spartans,</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> did not forbid it only; but were alſo forced to aboliſh Debts contracted; and for publick benefit, reſcin'd the compacts and promiſes that private Men had made, though they ſeemed inviolable, as having been made under the Authority of the Laws, and upon the ſecurity of general cuſtom, which they were not wont to over-rule. An act of very particular conſequence All Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Contracts ſhould be annulled, yea the culpable and complices as to the crime of Uſury, put to death; the Uſurer in <hi>Plato</hi>'s opinion, being worſe than the Thief.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Law ſhould be, to permit Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts for annual Rent out of Land: yet with charge, that they be publiſh'd for publick ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; as I have ſaid elſewhere, when I treated of the ſhortning of Law-ſuits. Withall, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to a denier, the Arrearages, which are a kind of Uſury, but the moſt tolerable of any ſeeing there is an Alienation of the Land; and it is a fiction prudently hit upon by the Popes <hi>Calixtus</hi> the Third, and <hi>Martin</hi> the Fifth. As for the Declaration in form of an Edict which is to be made herein; Contracts, even the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made, ſhould be reduced to the Thirtieth denier. The <hi>Romans</hi> limited Uſe to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth, afterwards to the Two hundredth, and at length aboliſh'd it altogether.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:109071:47"/>A third Law ſhould be, that no ſum lent to any Son of a Family, or to others under 25 years of age, without the conſent and authority of their Relations, do produce any action; no not thought the Contracts be ratified by the Debtors, after they come of age. <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> made a like Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; and there is nothing more effectual to repreſs the greedineſs of Uſurers, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch of young people: whereupon they would ſet themſelves to labour, to exerciſes and ſtudy. The profit which theſe Laws would yield the State, beſide their ſtopping the courſe of great Evils, would be, that perſons who are alway concern'd, and impatient to be getting, ſeeing they could not put out their Money at Intereſt eaſily, and that the Intereſt of their Contracts would be at too low a rate, muſt of force ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to two things, each of which is eminently advantageous to the Kingdom. For they would addict themſelves to Trades and Husbandry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or put their Money in the hands of Merchants to make benefit of it, if not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into partnerſhip with them, which they ſhould be permitted to do. For Uſury in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Commerce, was never forbidden, and is the Secret that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have found, to make all their people Merchants. On the other hand, the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> have engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Traffick, upon obſerving the profit it yielded.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Law might be, that Gentlemen be diſabled to ſell their Fiefs or Inheritances, until they have made declaration of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty in open Court. Among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Lands engaged reverted to their ancient own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:109071:47"/>
at the Jubilee. The <hi>Spartans</hi> Lands were not divided at all; I mean thoſe 7000 por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which <hi>Lycurgus</hi> had lotted out. The <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crians</hi> in like manner ſold not their Eſtates: the ſame is obſerved in <hi>Flanders.</hi> The Fiefs of the great Houſes of <hi>Bretanie</hi> are never parted out. Subſtitution of Heirs in <hi>France</hi> doth hinder the Alienation of Lands. In <hi>Spain</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen cannor ſell their Eſtates: And Laſtly, the Demeſne of the Crown in <hi>France,</hi> is in-ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enable, which may preſcribe a Law for all No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Families. This Ordinance would make Gentlemen good Husbands. When the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> and all civilized-People, made a partition of their Lands, they conſider'd the benefit that might thence redound to their States, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wiſely provided, that all ſuch as poſſeſs'd Inheritances ſhould fix in the Country: having an Eſtate there which they could not carry away, they would love the places where they had their ſubſiſtance; and every one defending his own Poſſeſſion, all would jointly defend the Common-wealth, and fight for the Publick Intereſts.</p>
                     <p>The Fifth Law ſhould be, that a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being ruin'd, and having acknowledged his Poverty in Court, ſhould be no longer No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; there being no Eſtate ſo ſhameful, as that of a Man of Quality reduc'd to an extream Miſery. On the contrary, that a <hi>Plebeian,</hi> when he hath rais'd himſelf an advantageous Fortune, which might be limited at 50000 Crowns, ſhould be ennobled; provided always, that the profit had been made by laudable and lawful means.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:109071:48"/>A ſixth Law ſhould be, to hinder the publick begging of the Poor, by appointing the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt penalties upon it; and ordain, for that end, that every Pariſh both in Town and Country, do maintain their own Poor, not ſuffering them to wander; puniſh all that make a Trade of it; ſend the ſtouteſt of them to the Gallies, and ſet all the reſt on work according to their ability. This is a means to fetch out that idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is among the meaner ſort.</p>
                     <p>The ſeventh Law might be, to render Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers reſponſible, as to Civil Intereſts, for all the Faults and Crimes their Children ſhould commit while they depend on them, and under 25 years of age; or, however, whilſt they dwell in their Fathers Houſe. The Mulct to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for afterwards in the Patrimony of thoſe faulty Children; This Law is in force in <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanie,</hi> and was ſo at <hi>Rome.</hi> Maſters, in like manner, for the faults of their Houſhold-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; and paying an Arbitrary Fine beſides, becauſe they ought to correct them. In the Third place, Provoſt Marſhals and their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, for all Robberies and Murthers commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the High-ways, Burglaries, Counterfeit Coin, and other the like Crimes within their diſtrict, if they took not up the Malefactors, and brought them to their Trial. This Law would hinder well-nigh all miſchiefs of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it being, as may be ſaid, of publick No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriety, that Provoſts hold Intelligence with all perſons of ill Life. Again, all Lieutenants criminal and Judges, for the Crimes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their Towns, by the ſame reaſon. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Inns, and Houſes of Entertainment, for
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:109071:48"/>
the Crimes committed by their Gueſts, while they are in their Houſes. Owners of Houſes, for the Crimes committed by their Tenants during their term; becauſe they ought to know, and anſwer for the good abearing of ſuch as they entertain. Captains and Officers for the Crimes of their Soldiers; the Inhabitants of an Houſe for thoſe committed in it. This is done in <hi>Spain.</hi> In the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Towns, the Townſmen of each Street are reſponſible for what is done there; And if a Man be ſlain, the Townſman before whoſe door he falls, is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to pay for his Blood. This Order is excellent. For aſſoon as there is a noiſe in the Street, all run thither, and the Authors of the Fact, whatever it be, are ſeized, brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judge, and forthwith puniſh'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the quality of the Crime. In paralel to this Rule of Government in <hi>Turkie,</hi> ſevereſt penalties muſt be impoſed upon ſuch as tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the Laws, and eſpecially the Laws that relate to Publick Order and Policy; thoſe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties alſo ſpeedily inflicted; otherwiſe the ſaid Laws will be of no uſe. For example, 'Tis ordained in <hi>France,</hi> that no Lackey wear a Sword; that no Towns-man have Arms; or that Bakers make their Bread of a certain Weight, or other things of like nature. They that obey not, muſt be inſtantly puniſhed, the Rich by pecuniary Fines, the Poor by Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Penalties. The <hi>Turks</hi> cauſe Offenders who have not Money to pay their Fines, to be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with a Lath.</p>
                     <p>An Eighth Law, All Printers and Bookſellers muſt be forbidden, and that upon pain of death,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:109071:49"/>
to Print, Sell, Diſperſe, ſet to Sale, or keep any Book of what Quality or Subject ſoever, without its having been Approved, and Licence given them under Seal in due manner; after which may nothing be added to the Book.</p>
                     <p>But as it is juſt to puniſh bad Subjects, ſo it is reaſonable to reward the good: and them that out of love to their Country, employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in advancing its Reputation and Glory. The King ought to be the ſole Maſter and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter of all Rewards; and confer them himſelf, ſo as they that receive any Beneficence of His, may be convinc'd they owe it to His Bounty. This would be an infallible means to attract to Him the hope of His Subjects, and together with it, their Reſpect, whereupon every one would ſtrive to pleaſe Him, in doing of his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and no body promiſe himſelf any Grace or Advantage, but by his Merit, his Services and Diligence. There are ſeveral kinds of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with which His Majeſty may Honour His Subjects; I ſay, Honour them; becauſe a Subject, in receiving a benefit from the hand of the King, receives withal, a mark of the Eſteem which is had of his Perſon, and of the ſatisfaction he hath given in his Conduct. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more glorious to a Man of Worth; nothing can yield him a truer Contentment. A Gift from an ordinary hand is many times ſomewhat ſhameful to him that takes it; and hence comes the adage, That it is better to Give than to Receive. But when a King is the Donor, the Dignity of the Royal Hand doth add to the Gift a new quality, which augmenteth the Worth and Excellency of it:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:109071:49"/>
whence it is, in ſuch a caſe no leſs praiſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive than to give.</p>
                     <p>This now which I have affirmed, cannot be doubted of: yet it may be taken for evident, that of theſe rewards, there are ſome purely Honourable, others only Profitable; and a laſt ſort, both Honourable and Profitable too. The reward purely Honorary is, when the King confers upon a Subject ſome Dignity which he had not afore; as upon a <hi>Plebeian,</hi> the quality of Gentleman, upon a Gentleman that of Knight, or Marqueſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and permits him to carry <hi>Fleurdelizes</hi> in his Coat of Arms, or ſome other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Memorial of a great Action: Or grants him the privilege to wear a Crown in his Creſt, or the like. This kind of reward is unlimited, becauſe Sovereignty is a ſource from whence new Honours and Dignities inceſſantly flow; as projections of Light do every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment iſſue from the Sun, without exhauſting its ſecondity; and on the contrary, the more rays that it emitteth, the more reſplendent is it in it ſelf; ſo the more Honours a King confers, the greater Luſtre He adds to His own Royal Majeſty. The <hi>Romans,</hi> of any People upon Earth, did moſt abound in conferring rewards of this nature: and on that account, brought into uſe Crowns, Triumphs, Statues, Rings, Inſcriptions, Publick Praiſes; and ſtuck not to grant Deifications, Temples and Sacrifices: ſuch a love they had for Virtue; and ſo ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous were they to inhance the merit of their Fellow-Citizens: thus inciting them to worthy Perſormances, and principally to an advancing the power of the Common-wealth. For any
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:109071:50"/>
man that hath a Noble Spirit, and is Virtuouſly diſpos'd, does more to merit a juſt reward, than he would to gain the Empire of the World: becauſe in the iſſue, 'tis always Virtue that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs; and oft-times but Fortune that rules. In conformity to this example, which both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and the Authors of it, and Experience, do render Illuſtrious, the King may Honour ſuch as ſerve Him beſt, with Honourable Titles; but ought to puniſh all thoſe, who, without His Permiſſion, dare aſſume and uſurp them. 'Tis neceſſary that there be a difference of rank between Perſons; and the diſtinguiſhing of them by their merit, is to be preferr'd far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all diſcrimination made by their Wealth.</p>
                     <p>It would alſo be very commodious, that as the Honour of Knighthood is purely Perſonal, ſo the King ſhould make the Dignity of Baron, of Marqueſs, of Count, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Perſonal likewiſe; not real, or annexed to Eſtates; the ſaid Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to become extinct by deceaſe of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons inveſted with them. This Expedient, to recompence Men of worth, being well managed, would produce a marvellous effect; and an whole race, thereby become Men of Merit. For, what would not the Son of one of theſe perſonal Marqueſſes do, to prevent falling from that degree of Honour which his Father had? and how could he chooſe but preſs vigorouſly on in the Court of Honour that has been thus mark'd out to him? But in this caſe, there is one thing to be further done, which might much profit the State, by laying a more Expreſs Obligation on the Nobility to ſerve the King: and that is, that the King do give His Letters
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:109071:50"/>
for perſonal Marqueſſates, in ſuch form as they may be verified in the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Chamber of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, and the Perſons Honoured with them, do homage to His Majeſty thereupon. Such kind of Homages have been done heretofore for Officers, and even for Penſions, though but of two hundred <hi>Livres.</hi> The Emperour in <hi>Germany</hi> hath, in this manner, made Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Counts of the Empire, as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the late <hi>Count de Guimene;</hi> who had not a foot of Land within the Emperours Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The King of <hi>England</hi> creates a Gentleman, Baron, and Earl of a Barony, or County, in which the Gentleman poſſeſſeth Nothing.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond kind of Gratifications and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, is of thoſe that are purely gainful and pecuniary; as Penſions, Tickets for Money, Acquittances by Patent, Ranſoms, Confiſcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of deceaſing Strangers goods, and the like. Theſe however, carry a great deal of honour with them, as I ſaid afore. The third kind, is of thoſe that are at once both gainful an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, as Great Offices, Governments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon this matter of Rewards, there is this further Reflection to be made; namely, that a King never be inform'd of a good Action, but He gratifie the Actor, either with Praiſes, or with Benefits. In fine, all theſe favours muſt be regulated by conſideration of His Service, and the welfare of His State. GOD, in giving Princes a Sovereign Power, inſpires into them Affection for their People. But His will is, that it be a Paternal Affection; that a King do open His Boſom to His Subjects, as His very Children; and that all His Counſels and Deſigns be levell'd
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:109071:51"/>
at their Felicity; without which, Himſelf cannot be happy. 'Tis principally for this great and glorious effect, that Kings are Images of GOD, and be fortified with His Spirit.</p>
                     <p>I have ſaid, that Monarchs are in their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, what the Soul is in the Body of Man, that external Goods cannot enrich them; that Virtue alone is their proper Portion, as it is of GOD Himſelf. It now remaineth I ſhould ſay what kind of Virtue it ought to be.</p>
                     <p>'Tis neceſſary that a Great Prince have Piety, to give His Subjects an Example of it; and bettering of them in this, is the ſecurity of His State. He muſt be juſt to govern them. A Government never is of long duration without Juſtice. This Queen of Virtues comprehends, (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> judiciouſly noted) all the reſt. A King I ſay muſt be Juſt, to render unto every one, and unto Himſelf, what is reſpectively due. The third Virtue of a Prince, is Prudence, to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee of Himſelf what may betide His States. Thus a wiſe Pilot hath the skill to foreſee Calms and Storms: he knows by ſecret notices, whether the Winds will be favourable, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Voyage. The fourth Virtue is Magnanimity; a weight this, that keeps the Soul always in the ſame poſition, and gives it ſo ſetled a firmneſs, that neither good nor bad ſucceſſes can put it out of place; and a King appears unalterable: He thus bears up the hope of His Subjects; they look upon Him as an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured ſuccour againſt Fortune, and perſuade themſelves, there is ſomewhat of Divine Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in His Perſon. Of Royal Virtues, a fifth is Clemency; It pertains to the greatneſs of a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:109071:51"/>
King, that He be benign, and do commiſerate the weakneſſes of His Subjects; who are Men as He is. Miſchances are pardonable, and it ſeems to me, 'tis too much rigor to puniſh a poor wretch for a Crime committed out of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, or by neceſſity; and of which he is leſs guilty, if I may ſay it, than his ill deſtiny, 'Tis to Criminals of this kind, that Grace ſhould not be deny'd: and when a King gives one of His Subjects his Life, who hath been condemn'd to death, he ſhould rejoyce more at the feeling in the Secret of his Heart a Will to Pardon: than at the having in His hand the power to puniſh. To give a Man his Life, is in ſome ſort to create him; and the preſerving of his Being, is a giving of it. It would be, 'tis true, a great fault, to ſtop the courſe of Juſtice, in caſe of publick Crimes, and ſuch as have diſturb'd the Peoples Peace: Yet in ſum it is Noble, that a King be inclin'd to compaſſion and Mercy.

                     <p>The ſixth Royal Virtue is Liberality. One of the Ancients pronounced, that it was leſs diſadvantageous for a King to be overcome by Arms, than by Liberality. A Poet intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> excellently ſaying, That he had nothing left him but the Benefits he had conferred. And to ſay true, A Great Prince never enjoys His Wealth, but when He hath given it. Liberality enricheth Him, and makes Him Purchaſes of ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

value. For thereby 'tis, that He wins the love of his own People, and becomes admired of all others. When I ſay Liberality, I mean a judicious Liberality, ſuch as is a Virtue, not an exorbitant profuſeneſs; a Liberality alway exercis'd with Advantage, and with Glory.</p>
                     <p>To conclude in ſhort; when I conſider other Virtues, I do not find any one of them all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for a King; but it is impoſſible a King ſhould have thoſe which I have mention'd, without having every one of the reſt; ſince they are inſeparable Companions, and muſt be united to make a Virtuous Man.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Art of Finances, or the Treaſury, is a principal part of the Politicks; and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:109071:52"/>
ſo much the more neceſſary in a State, in that Money is the Soul of all Affairs. A Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is no further powerful, than proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably to the richneſs of its publick Treaſury, and the greatneſs of the yearly Income that maintain it. This the <hi>French</hi> Name plainly importeth; for <hi>Finance</hi> is an old Word, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying Power, and comes from the ancient Verb <hi>Finer,</hi> which is to be able, to may or can.</p>
                     <p>Three particulars are here to be conſidered. Firſt, Juſt and eaſie means to make Money. Secondly, the prudent expending it. Thirdly, the keeping it in, and laying it up for neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that may happen; as Famine, Peſtilence, War, Fire, Shipwrack, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>We have in <hi>France</hi> three general means to make Money; The King's Demeſnes. Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions on the People, Merchandiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of this laſt I will ſpeak in the Chapter of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. I will ſay nothing here of Conqueſts; which may come in for a Fourth means of Get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; I will treat of them elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>Before any further advance into this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it will be pertinent to obſerve, that the fundamental Wealth of a State conſiſts in the Multitude and Plenty of Subjects. For 'tis Men that Till the Ground; that produce Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures; that manage Trade; that go to War; that People Colonies; and in one word, that bring in Money. To make way in <hi>France</hi> for multiplying of Men, and oblige them to Marry, the King may at once do two things, after the example of the Emperor <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> Firſt, He may decree Priviledges and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:109071:53"/>
in favour of ſuch as ſhall have divers Children; exempting them from Guardian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, from being Collectors, from Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to look to the Fruits of Sequeſtred Lands, and other burthenſom Offices: He may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them from Subſidies, and even give them ſome Eſtate. Secondly, He might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe penalties upon thoſe that Marry not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a certain Age: and take part in the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of all ſorts of perſons, who in contempt of Law and Wedlock, live ſingle, not having impediment by any natural infirmity. 'Tis up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a like conſideration, that I ſaid in a former Chapter, the King, to reſtrain Parents from compelling their Daughters into Cloiſters, might Declare, that the right of all Recluſes in any Succeſſion, was veſted in Himſelf: And 'tis for the very ſame reaſon that the Ancient Earls of <hi>Flanders</hi> were Heirs to all the Prieſts that were their Subjects.</p>
                     <p>Now to that which <hi>Auguſtus</hi> did for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of his Subjects to Marry, the King might add Two particulars: One is, That the Firſt Year a Man Taxable did Marry the firſt time, being under 26 years of age, he ſhould be exempt from all Subſidies and Impoſitions, and publick Charges, even quartering of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, in caſe he kept Houſe apart, and was ſetled in a Dwelling of his own. If the newly Married be the King's Officer, his Office ſhould not fall into the King's hand, if he died within the year. Commanders alſo, and Soldiers ſhould be diſpens'd with, as to their ſerving for that time, unleſs on urgent neceſſity, or ſome important occaſion. The other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:109071:53"/>
which in <hi>France</hi> had need to be added to <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s Ordinances, is, to take effectual Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that perſons once Married, be not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſeparated again as they are. For 'tis to no purpoſe to contract Marriages, if they be not ſtuck to, and the coupled Parties cohabit not.</p>
                     <p>A ſtrange abuſe in this matter of ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath crept in of late, nor know I how the Officials have become ſo favourable in it, or how the Parliaments have ſuffer'd it. Now-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, a Woman that would have, as they ſay, her ſwing, and without controul, practice all that her giddy, witleſs, and oft times wanton humour prompts her to, raiſeth ſtirs in the Houſe, at length tires out her Husbands pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; hereupon, ſhe complains of his Vices, hath Servants ſuborned for her purpoſe; a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce comes to be adjudged upon their Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Husband is ſentenced to yield her up her Goods, and not only do that, but alſo to let her have poſſeſſion of her Dower, or of a good part of it; at leaſt to allow her a great Penſion. Then this Woman reties, takes an Houſe, and lives after her own faſhion, which is not alway the moſt commendable in the World; her Husband the while, ſinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the whole weight of his Houſhold Affairs. Had ſhe counted upon nothing elſe, but that of neceſſity ſhe muſt live with her Husband, and in his Houſe, ſhe would have formed her ſelf to it, and not have play'd her vexatious pranks; ſo ſhe had promoted the happineſs of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and of the Children, and together with it, her own. For application therfore
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:109071:54"/>
of a remedy in this caſe, it muſt be a Law That a Wife ſhall not ſue for a Separation' as to Perſon or Habitation, but by the advice' of four of her neareſt Kindred; Men of known Integrity: and that a Separation being order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either by Sentence in Court, or by Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation between the parties, ſhe ſhall be bound to enter a Monaſtery, without egreſs again; nor ſuffered to admit a viſit from any man there; it being contrary to Publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, that a Woman who hath loſt her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, (for to be ſeparated from him, is to loſe him) ſhould appear openly, and maintain commerce with other Men. On the other hand, her Sex, and all ſeemlineſs requiring, that in this eſtate ſhe hide her ſelf, and hide withal her ill fortune, and her grief for it. I would too that a very ſlender Penſion be adjud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her. And ſince Husbands will be found in fault on their part likewiſe, and diſcover their ill husbandry, it would be very juſt, that the diſpoſal of their Eſtates be not left to them, nor the poſſeſſion of more than a part of 'em: as is the caſe of Wives: and that ſuppoſing they have Children, the Money ariſing from the remainder, ſhould be received, employed, and adminiſtred by a Guardian: He to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt for it to the ſaid Children in due time. If there be none, the Revenue exceeding the Penſion ſhould be laid out on Hoſpitals, and other neceſſities of the State. This Law ſhould extend to Separations already made. And ſuch rigour being practis'd in matter of Divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there would be no more of 'em. Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and Wives would be under a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:109071:54"/>
Obligation, to live together, and to live together diſcreetly: ſo they would breed up a Family that might prove the contentment of their Life, the comfort of their elder years; and be beneficial to the whole Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>There is a further conſideration to be made in the matter of the Finances; and it is this, namely, that it is expedient the King ſhould declare, that for the future He will be Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and Donotary to His Receivers and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable Officers, fot their Wives dotal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and Marriage ſettlements, and for their Childrens Portions and Donatives: then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining the late Ordinances to take away all difficulty, declare further, the crime of miſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying the publick Money to be puniſhable by death; and ordain, that the Intereſts, Amends, and civil Reparations adjudged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Criminals of that kind, ſhould fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Heirs or Legatees. This Law is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous; yet it is juſt and neceſſary: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it will ſtrike terror on the Financiers: who having no hope to eſcape Juſtice, could not entertain a Thought of committing a fault that would ruine all that is deareſt to them. Beſide, the <hi>Romans</hi> puniſh'd even with death, the very friends of thoſe whom they condemn'd for Crimes againſt the State; the Hiſtory of <hi>Sejanus</hi> affords unqueſtionable proof of it.</p>
                     <p>That which we call the Demeſne of the King, and of the Crown, cannot be Alienated, nor is it liable to any charge or encumbrance. This Law is Fundamental in all kind of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, as well as in <hi>France.</hi> But here
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:109071:55"/>
things are judged to belong to the Crown three manner of ways from all Antiquity: As the Soveraignty, the power of War, Subſidies, and the like. By Declaration; when the King, by His Letters, declares ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar united to the Crown. By Confeſſion, when for the continued ſpace of ten years, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers have accompted for it to the Chamber. There are many queſtions propoſable in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Demeſne; but it is not our buſineſs to State them. <hi>Chopin</hi> may be conſulted, who hath learnedly written of this Subject.</p>
                     <p>In neceſſities of the State, divers things have been engaged by the King to the uſe of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, who have paid in Sums thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yet theſe perſons cannot hinder, but that the things may be recovered. And there are two equitable ways to effect this. The Firſt is, by making a Principal of what is due to thoſe Creditors, and aſſigning them Rents up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Town Hall of <hi>Paris,</hi> or ſome other place; of which there are examples. For when the King had Sold, or rather engaged ſome Rights of His unto particular Men, they have been reſum'd by Contracts for a Rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge. Now thoſe Rights were Demeſne, upon which, to recover the Demeſne, Rents were charged. The ſame courſe then may be taken again. Nor could the Engagees have any cauſe to complain; for the engagements made to 'em, are but to ſecure their due, and give them not any propriety: their ſecurity therefore will be as great when they have Contracts for Rent. For the one and the other pertains to the Demeſne ſtill. And ſuch
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:109071:55"/>
kind of Impoſitions in like manner, the power to impoſe them being Royal and Dominical, the Engagees concerned will by this means have ſecurity for ſecurity, and Rent for Rent. But that the King may reap advantage from this exchange, it is neceſſary to ſettle a Stock for the raiſing of theſe new Rents; and to that end, a new Impoſition muſt be laid upon the Clergy, the Countries of State, Cities, Commonalties, Companies, Colledges, Merchants, and other Members of the Kingdom, the Engagees them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves paying their proportions. There is in this no inconvenience at all: becauſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſne having been engaged for the preſervation and defence of all the Corporations in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it is natural, that they all contribute to free it again.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond way to diſengage the Demeſne, would be, by giving ready Money inſtead of Rents, and making an Impoſition for this end, which might be more eaſie. A reimburſement ſhould be compleated in five or ſix years. Mean time, and before all things, the Engagees muſt be put out of Poſſeſſion, and order given, that the Receivers of the Demeſne do take up the profits. For if any condition be propos'd while the ſaid Engagees are in poſſeſſion, they will make a thouſand difficulties at it; and on the contrary, if they no longer poſſeſs, they will readily conſent. But that the matter may be tranſacted with leſs noiſe, it ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedited in each Parliament apart: or at leaſt the Receivers commanded, by virtue of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Kings Council, to receive all the profits, and even thoſe of the engaged De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſnes.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:109071:56"/>
If there be not made a new impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in order to recover thoſe Demeſnes, the affair will not be of advantage to the King; and there may one be very juſtly made for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons now alledged, and for the putting of things again in order, Let us paſs unto the art of the Tallies.</p>
                     <p>The Impoſition of the Tallies [or Taxes] is a kind of Subſidy or Aid laid upon the people. Under it, (in <hi>France</hi>) are comprehended the Tallion, and the Subſiſtance; as they term them. The Tallie is hugely equitable; it is ancient; it is neceſſary; and in uſe all the world over. For there never was People that paid not to defray the publick Expences. In <hi>France</hi> it is ſo moderate, and may be ſo eaſily paid, that it hath been known to be higher than now it is: becauſe the ſums that make it up are receiv'd without much trouble: Yet at preſent, though it be conſiderably diminiſh'd, the People are ſcarce able to pay it, and the Country extreamly incommodated by it. The prime cauſe of this is, that the ratable perſons conſidered, the rates are not duely proportion'd; the rich Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, the Juſticers of the Villages, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens Farmers, the Eleus, and other Perſons of Power, are ſo eaſed, that they pay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt nothing, and the pooreſt of all do bear all. A ſecond cauſe of the miſchief is, that they who are Commiſſion'd to receive the Tallies, do ſo run up the charges, that they far exceed the principal, and thus draw Money out of the Peoples hands, which they can part with but once. When the Sergeants of Villages need a Cow, or Corn,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:109071:56"/>
or ſome piece of Houſhould-ſtuff, they go to the Peaſants houſes where they know the ſame is to be had; there they make Seizures, and then Sales at what price they pleaſe. They ſeize and ſell whatever they find, to the very Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-loaf of Bread that hath been cut, and is in uſe: upon this, the poor Ruſtick hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left to help himſelf, but is utterly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, and can no longer do his work. The greateſt part of theſe Officers muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd; the more there are of them in the matter of the Finances, the more diſorder and oppreſſion there is. For all of them look for profit; and they ſpoil all by their avarice and ignorance.</p>
                     <p>To remedy the two Evils that have been mention'd, effectual order muſt be taken that the Peaſants may pay equally; that is, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the eſtate they have; and pay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out charges ſuperadded. Firſt, all the Taxes ſhould be made real, as they are in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> that every one may pay. Secondly, The Tax ſhould be levied in kind of the fruits that are receiv'd from the Lands and Tenements, as Wine, Sider, Beer, Corn, Cattle, and the like; the quantity that is to be taken being ſtinted and fix'd, for example, to a Tenth part. A Peaſant that might have ten Buſhels of Corn, would very willingly pay one to the King, and might do it without inconvenience. But when for payment of Forty Sous in Money, which he hath not, the Sergeants and Collectors ſeize upon, and ſell the ten Buſhels of Corn, which too are priz'd at an extream low rate, and all is ſpent in charges, doth he not really, inſtead
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:109071:57"/>
of Forty Sous, pay Twenty Livres? This turns not at all to the profit of the King, and tends to the undoing of his People.</p>
                     <p>Under the name of Lands and Tenements this Tenth might be extended unto Houſes in Cities, Towns and Villages, and they ordered to pay a Tenth part of the Money they might be let out for; which ſhould be very low rated. In like manner a Tenth or Twentieth part might be taken upon Contracts for a Rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge. For theſe are ſtocks, and a real Eſtate. The Eccleſiaſticks, who have ſure been wary men, have taken their Rents in kind, and theſe ſorts of Rents are now infinitely augmented. The greateſt part of the Revenues of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Aegyptians</hi> themſelves, was paid in Fruits. They paid their Armies and Officers with them. Many Kings have taken a Tenth of Eſtates, oft-times a Fifth, ſometimes a Third. It is not neceſſary that the People have Money; but they muſt have Fruits for ſuſtenance of life. The King might have Farmers of this Tenth in each Pariſh, or in each Election, who might let out under<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Farms of it to the Peaſants, as is done in the Tyths of the Church.</p>
                     <p>If it be thought fit to take things in kind, there muſt be Magazines in Cities, as there are Store-houſes for Salt: in them the Receivers ſhould ſell the Fruits, or reſerve them, as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> did in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> The King will need them for Armies, for Fleets, for Victualling places of ſtrength, for Tranſportation into Foreign parts; eſpecially in caſe of a Famine. This is practis'd in many Countries abroad, and particularly in <hi>Italy.</hi> What is done in a petty
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:109071:57"/>
State, may be done in a great Kingdom. It is not to be doubted, but that if the Tallie were thus rais'd, it would go further than it does, and the People ſuffer no incommodity by it at all. But one thing which preſſeth more at preſent, is, the putting of the Country in caſe again. For this end, the rich muſt be permitted to give Cows, Sheep, and other Cattle, upon terms, to the poor Peaſants. This is done in very many places, yea, in the greateſt part of the Kingdom. The too ſevere, and over-ſcrupulous Pariſh Prieſts prohibit it; but they will not any longer be able to do ſo, when the thing is publickly permitted.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems unreaſonable, that ſome certain Cities ſhould, upon imaginary Privileges, be for ever exempted from the charges of the State; and mean time, the Country bear the whole weight of them. The pretext of theſe Franchiſes hath induced divers of the Peaſants to retire to theſe places. Order muſt be taken in the caſe, and all theſe Cities obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the expences of the Kingdom, which they are ſo conſiderable a part of. They may then be brought to pay, under colour of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance or Loan. There ſhould be Gariſons ſent them, or Soldiers quartered upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that all the Beams of the State may bear their part in publick affairs, and ſo the weight be more eaſie to them, whereas one alone would be over-charg'd, and break under it.</p>
                     <p>The third means the King hath to bring Him in Money, conſiſts in the Gabells. Some have ſaid, that the Gabells are not of the nature of the Kings Demeſne: and their reaſon is,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:109071:58"/>
becauſe the Ordinances for the firſt impoſition of them do import, that it was not the Kings intention they ſhould ſo be. The contrary might be true. For, beſide that the Salt-pits did heretofore belong to the Emperour, as goods of the Empire, the ſums that are raiſed out of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are raiſed by publick Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and turn to the profit of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: as hath been done for many Ages. But however that be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not to enter into a diſpute, which can be of no conſequence here, I will conſider the Gabells according to the preſent ſtate of things. I will not ſay when this kind of Impoſition did commence in <hi>France;</hi> nor upon what examples of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity our Kings did ground themſelves. Not will I explain, how, beſide the Gabells of <hi>France,</hi> which are call'd <hi>The grand party,</hi> there are the Gabells of <hi>Provence, Dauphine, Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Lionnois;</hi> becauſe the thing is known, and makes not to our purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The Gabells are paid in <hi>France</hi> by two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent means. Firſt by Impoſitions; ſo in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces neighbouring on the Salt-free Countries. There, for fear the Subjects would not take Salt at the Kings Garners, the Officers ſee how many Minots each Pariſh ought to take: then a rate is made in the Pariſhes, for it, as for the Tallie. The ſecond means is without Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: this is the uſe in places remote from the Salt-free Countries. There, becauſe prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Salt cannot be brought in, every one fetcheth from the Garners at the price currant.</p>
                     <p>The King receives a great deal of Money from theſe Gaballs; but the People pay exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:109071:58"/>
beyond what comes into His Coffers. The infinite number of Officers belonging to a Store-houſe, the Receivers, the Commiſſioners, the Archers, the Charges, the Portage, the Fees of Officers, to whom Preſents are alſo made, do ſwallow up huge ſums, which the King fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers not, and the People do pay. For there is not a petty Gabeller but lives handſomely by his Employment: not a Commiſſioner but makes him a Fortune, and grows rich upon it, making good chear, and great expences. 'Tis of very much importance that a remedy be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to the malady; and in truth, the vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the King's Subjects do ſuffer under pretext of the Gabelle, are not to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. The Archers enter into Houſes, to ſearch (they ſay) for concealed Salt: in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Authority the doors are open'd to them; mean time themſelves covertly convey in ſome Bags: hereupon they form a Proceſs; and the Maſter of the Houſe is exceſſively fin'd: nor do they depart till they have pillag'd all they can lay hands on. If entrance be deny'd them, they force the Houſe, and act all Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: nor dares any one complain; all are at their Mercy; and thus they ruine the poor Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom they ſingle out. This is no way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to the King's affairs, nor is it His inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that His Subjects ſhould be ſo ill treated. But it is eaſie to break them of this courſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all, it muſt be debated in the Kings Council of the Finances, what ſum is fit to be taken for the Salt; this ſum being determin'd at ten or twelve Millions; for example, two ſeveral parts of it ſhall be ſet out, to be yearly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:109071:59"/>
paid: one for the Country-Pariſhes, another for the Cities. Each of theſe allotted parts ſhall be ſent into each Generality, and thence to the places where there is a Store-houſe of Salt. The allotment for the Country ſhall be divided by the Pariſhes, as is now done for the Tallie, the Subjects among themſelves rating every one's proportion. The Gentlemen, the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> men, the Monaſticks, and others, muſt be engaged in it, and bear their part: becauſe they are charged by reaſon Salt is ſo dear as now it is; and by conſequence, the King making a change to the profit of all, all ought to be taxed, to recompence the diminution that will follow in the Finances.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Sum allotted for the Cities, ſhall in like manner be ſent to the Generalties, and Salt-Garners, that ſuch Rents as the Towns are to pay the King may be divided; The houſes may be meaſured by the Perch, and the Rents aſſeſſed accordingly; much like to what is done for cleanſing the Strrets at <hi>Paris.</hi> The Cities that claim a Freedom, as <hi>Angers, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhall enter into this contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the ſame reaſon that the Eccleſiaſticks and Gentlemen do; inaſmuch as they will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably profit by the ſuppreſſion of the Gabells, and abatement of the price of Salt. For it is to be obſerved, that that meaſure which now coſts at <hi>Paris</hi> five and forty Livres, might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount not to two Crowns, and ſo proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably in other Cities.</p>
                     <p>Now the number of Perches in each City being known, (having been taken by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the Kings, who might be Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens)
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:109071:59"/>
it will be very eaſie, on any neceſſity, toraiſe an aid from the City, upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the ſaid Perches, by way of Loan or Subvention, or under ſome other title. And that the Citizens may not oppoſe the Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in the matter, permiſſion muſt be given to each City, to treat every year with what Merchants they pleaſe; and agree a price for the Salt that ſhall be there ſold through the whole year; He to ſell it, who will oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to afford it beſt cheap; (except the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens had rather leave it free for all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants that would, to bring in,) always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that there be no power to compell any one to buy. The like may be done in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Village; the Gentleman cauſing Salt to be Sold in a Servant's name, and making the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it. This courſe, will, without doubt, be gain to the People; and Salt being ſold in ſuch manner, it may be brought to paſs, that the Commodity it ſelf ſhall pay the Rents which ſhall be due to the King, and they the while, buy it at much a lower rate than they do. So that clearly, all ſorts will receive ſuch a propoſal with applauſe. To augment the cheapneſs of Salt, it ſhould be ordained, that it be free from paying to Lordſhips, and by the Load, and from Impoſts.</p>
                     <p>The thing being reſolved in the Council, the King ſhall make a Declaration in form of an Edict, by which His Majeſty ſhall take off the Impoſitions upon Salt, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Towns and Pariſhes will pay Him year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Sums He ſhall reſolve upon in His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil: and that until the Declaration be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:109071:60"/>
the Gabell ſhall continue its courſe. It would be needful to ordain, that theſe Sums be paid into the hands of the Receivers of the Tallies. For there would be no more need of a Receiver of a Salt-garner. What are ſo many Receivers good for, but to conſume all? In this caſe, the Receivers of Salt muſt be otherwiſe diſpos'd of. This Declaration would include a ſuppreſſion of all the Officers of the Gabells; for when Salt ſhould be freely Sold, the King would have no more uſe of 'em. As for their re-imburſement, proviſion might be made, either by continuing their wages during their Lives, or by aſſigning them Rents, which might be redeemed for little and little; or by giving them ready Money. The People too might be charged with this re-imburſement, in favour of the ſuppreſſion of the Gabells. This Affair might be worth the King a great deal, and can never fail of being beneficial: the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will gain ſix Millions by it, beſide the quiet it will yield them. It being put in execution, the King may purchaſe the Salt-pits, upon the greateſt part of which, He would-previouſly have the Tenth part of the Salt, if He took the Tenth of all Revenues, as I ſaid afore. Again, in doing as hath been ſhewed, He would have an Army ready raiſed: for all the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers muſt be led into the Field. There are in their Companies notable ſtout Men, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo have been in action.</p>
                     <p>As for the Salt-free Countries which have bought out their freedom, no one durſt touch them hitherto, by reaſon of the ſtrength of the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> the Civil and Forraign Wars, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:109071:60"/>
other Conſiderations, as the Minority of Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now that the King is Maſter, and in a condition to make Himſelf be obeyed; 'tis reaſonable, that he do oblige ſo many great and rich Provinces to bear a part of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of the State, in proportion to their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, for the eaſing the reſt of <hi>France.</hi> And to this end, one of the three following Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be made them. Firſt, to take a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſement of the Sums paid by them; which re-imburſement ſhall be made, by granting them a diminution of the Tallies, without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hand in Purſe other ways. Hereto may be ſubjoyn'd, that the King may not wholly diſcharge them: becauſe ſuch a diſcharge tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the oppreſſing of his other Subjects: that a King may indeed augment and diminiſh Subſidies, as ſeemeth him good, but not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them; it not being poſſible, that a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould ſubſiſt without publick Incoms: that it muſt be remembred on this occaſion, how <hi>Nero</hi> propoſing to take off all the Impoſts that were paid at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Senate oppos'd it, as a thing that would be the ruine of the Empire. The Second Propoſition might be, that theſe Provinces be obliged to pay the King a yearly Rent, by way of Supplement, and in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ancient Treaty. The Third, that the Tallie, and other Impoſitions on them, be augmented, to even the ballance, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done any other way.</p>
                     <p>There are certain means to maintain the Finances; among others, the Free Gifts that are preſented to the King by the People of thoſe Provinces, which are called <hi>Countries of</hi>
                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:109071:61"/>
                        <hi>State.</hi> No other Order need be taken with them, but to hinder as much as may be, that the principal Members of theſe States be not in the Offices they bear, unjuſt at the Publick coſt. Yet they muſt make their advantages in them, otherwiſe the States would come to nothing; which would occaſion no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and a retardment of the King's Affairs. His Majeſty might make Himſelf Maſter of the Deputations, and gainful Commiſſions, which are given to the States: As for example, in <hi>Bretannie, Monſieur</hi> the late <hi>Mareſchal de la Milleray,</hi> nominated alone, or rather, caus'd to be nominated whom he pleas'd, and there was no more deliberating after he had given or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; 'twas one way he had to gratifie his Friends. <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Duke <hi>Mazarin,</hi> does the ſame ſtill; which may, in His perſon, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed well: but the King may cauſe whom he will to be nominated, and the liberty of the States will not ſuffer by it any prejudice, or innovation at all: for ſuch is the condition of things in theſe places. I will not ſpeak here of the Farms of Iron, nor of others of like va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. Theſe things run in ordinary courſe.</p>
                     <p>But having ſpoken of the bringing in of Money, I muſt ſpeak of a due laying out, and a like due laying up thereof. The advantage of an Exchequer doth not conſiſt in the bare getting in of Money; but alſo in a meet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending of it: and there is no leſs profit in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it forth, than in receiving of it. 'Tis neceſſary the King ſhould ſpend to maintain his Revenues. For if all the Sums that come into His Coffers ſhould not iſſue thence again,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:109071:61"/>
no one, in the end, would be able to pay Him any thing. The Kings of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> who took a third part of their Subjects Eſtates, caus'd the Labyrinth to be built, the Pyramids to be erected, the Lake of <hi>Meotis</hi> to be dug up, and other Fabricks raiſed, which are incredible to Poſterity. Their deſign was to diſperſe among People, the Treaſure they received from them; and withal, baniſh ſloth and idleneſs out of their States. Theſe two Vices, ſo dangerous in Kingdoms, the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Laws did ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provide againſt, that there were particular Magiſtrates appointed, unto whom every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Man was obliged to give an account eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year of all that he had done throughout the year; which was executed with ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs and rigor, that if any one had taken an ill courſe to live, or not preſerv'd his Eſtate, he was ſeverely puniſh'd for it. The ſame thing was done at <hi>Athens,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> had Cenſors, who took the like care; they had it in charge, to make a review of all the People every fiſth year, and inform the Senate of all that was amiſs in the Commonwealth. I have often wondred, that there is no ſuch Officer in <hi>France:</hi> and that each ones Eſtate is not preciſely known, which 'tis hugely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, it ſhould be; becauſe in difficult times, when the Kingdom perceives it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſelf involv'd in urgent neceſſities, ſuccor muſt be drawn from every one in proportion to his Intereſt in the Publick Fortune, that is, in proportion to what he poſſeſſeth in the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Expence muſt be made with good Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry; and a judicious parcimony obſerved in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:109071:62"/>
it; that it run not out to a profuſion on one hand, nor ſink into a ſordid avarice on the other: If Meaſure and Rule be not kept in the iſſuing out of Money, all the Gold of <hi>Aſia</hi> will be but a ſmall matter. <hi>Caligula</hi> found the way to conſume in his debauches in one year, the immenſe Treaſures which his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor had been heaping up all along the whole courſe of his Empire. Thus it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that a King do cauſe the ſums to be paid which are charged upon the Receipt of his Finances; and alſo that He give liberally; but always ſo order the matter by his Prudence, that nothing go out of, or be kept in his hand, but for the preſervation and proſperity of His Subjects.</p>
                     <p>I ſaid in a former Chapter, that there were too many Officers in <hi>France;</hi> that the wages they draw from the King were unprofitable, nay, prejudicial to the State. Since the Sale of Offices was introduced, divers new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been made. All theſe Edicts were meerly to get Money in ſome preſſing Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; and nothing but the conjunctures of the time rendred them tolerable. Now that thoſe occurrences are over, and the conjunctures paſs'd, things muſt be reduc'd to due order, by ſuppreſſing all thoſe new Officers.</p>
                     <p>I noted, that wherever Magiſtracy brought gain, diſorders would creep in; the reaſon of which is very clear, and very natural. For it is infallibly certain, that Judges will augment the number of Suits, while thoſe Suits will bring them in profit. Conſequently, uſeleſs Officers being ſuppreſs'd, and proviſion made
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:109071:62"/>
in the caſe by a due reduction, ſufficient Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries muſt be allowed them, and they forbidden to take any thing of the Plaintiff or Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, upon the Penalties expreſs'd in the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Statutes. And that the King might make a ſtock to raiſe thoſe Salaries, without char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging His Finances, it ſhould be ordained, that ſuch as go to Law ſhall, when they commence their Suit, depoſite a certain ſum into the hands of the Clerks: this, to be done in all the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Juriſdictions. As for other Judges, they ought to take nothing at all: the proprietary Lords muſt defray the charge of their Courts, if they will keep up the Power to hold them: they having it of the King upon this condition, from the firſt Grant of the Fiefs.</p>
                     <p>In matter of the Finances, it is not ſufficient to have the Secret of getting Money, and the skill of duly expending it: but there muſt be alſo a right courſe taken to make reſerves of it. The <hi>Romans</hi> had a publick Treaſury, where every year they laid up certain ſums for the neceſſities of the Commonwealth. Other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were no leſs provident. Hiſtory tells us of the Stores of <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Croeſus,</hi> of <hi>Midas,</hi> and many others. The King having ſetled an Order in His Finances, both as to Expences and Receipt, it will be very prudently done of Him, to limit what he ſhall think fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: and this reſervation ſhould make the firſt Article in his Finances, and be continued until he hath in his Coffers, in ſome ſecret place, the fourth part at leaſt of all the Coin in the Kingdom: the reſt (if well us'd) may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent for all the People to maintain Commerce,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:109071:63"/>
and pay the King's Revenues I ſay, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſhould be in a ſecret place, and known only to perſons of approved Fidelity. For if many had notice of it, ſuch a ſtore might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion Seditions, and Civil Wars. Now a fourth part of the Money being once laid up apart in the King's Coffers, ſome addition to it ſhall be made continually from year to year, in proportion to what comes in anew.</p>
                     <p>Yet liberty muſt be left to Perſons, for ſome time, to have Gold and Silver Plate: yea, it would do well, to augment the uſe and mode of having it, if it may be; and that for three reaſons. Firſt, becauſe the Goldſmiths per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving hope of gain, will not want inventions and induſtries to get into <hi>France</hi> as much Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal as poſſibly they may, either in ingots, or barrs, or coyned pieces. Secondly, becauſe by this means Riches will be kept in the Kingdom, and when a ſeaſon for it comes, all they that are owners of ſuch Plate, may be commanded to carry it to the Mint, and there receive the price of it. The third reaſon is, becauſe the Goldſmiths having wrought up, and made Plate, contrary to the direction of the Statute, (which undoubtedly they will do) a ſearch may be made in the caſe, if affairs require; a ſearch highly juſt, and no leſs advantageous.</p>
                     <p>Two regulations muſt be made for the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths, and they enjoyned to obſerve them, upon pain of forfeiting Life and Goods; and ſo ſtrict an hand held over them, that of all who trangreſs, not a Man be pardoned. The firſt is, to prohibit their working upon any piece of Gold, or Silver Coyn. The ſecond,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:109071:63"/>
that they do not change the form of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited Plate: rectifie and mend it they may. At the ſame time, all Perſons that have any ſuch and would put it off, muſt be commanded upon great penalties, to carry it to the Mint, where ready Money ſhall be paid them for it, at the currant price; they making proof that they are the true owners; and this to avoid Thieveries which may have been committed. Theſe two regulations will oblige the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths to make uſe of new Silver, or Foreign Coyns, and thus they would cauſe a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity of either to enter into <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The State would receive no ſmall profit by taking a due order in matter of Coyn. It ſhould be ordained therefore in the firſt place; that no more be made any where but at <hi>Paris;</hi> and all other Mints, and their Officers, ſuppreſs'd as Uſeleſs. The <hi>Romans,</hi> who had ſo much Money, had but one place to make it in, which was a Temple of <hi>Juno</hi>'s at <hi>Rome. Charlemain</hi> forbad any Money to be made otherwhere than in His Palace. And the truth is, ſhould all the Money of <hi>France</hi> paſs through <hi>Paris,</hi> the King would much better know what quantity of it was in His Kingdom. Secondly, the <hi>Court des Monnoyes</hi> muſt be ſuppreſs'd, and united to the Chamber of Accompts, as I have ſaid hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. In the third place, the value of Braſs Money muſt be abated; this kind of Coyn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ruine of the State. It cannot be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd how many Liarts and Sous the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have brought into <hi>France.</hi> It would be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to ſet the Sous at two Liarts a-piece, the Liarts at a Denier, and the Doubles at an
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:109071:64"/>
Obole, (half a Denier:) but this ſhould be done by little and little, and the fall made by degrees, that the people be not ruin'd: mean time, Silver pieces of ſix blanks, others of a Sous in value, and of twelve Deniers, are to be ſtamped. Braſiers, and workers in Mettal, muſt be forbidden to melt up any Sous, Liarts, or Doubles; or otherwiſe uſe them in work. For after the Reduction, a Sous, a Liart, and a Double, would be worth more in work than in Money; and that quantity of them which is in the Kingdom being preſerv'd, would ſuffice for Commerce in ſmall wares; they alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> worth in Money than otherwiſe, Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners would bring in no more of them. In the fourth place, 'tis fit that a Gold-coyn be made of the value of the <hi>Leuis</hi>'s; this Coyn to have on the front a Sun, the face thereof repreſenting the King, with theſe words about it, <hi>Nec pluribus impar,</hi> and the year it is made in: On the reverſe, a Croſs charged or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned with Fleurdelizes; and the ordinary Motto, <hi>CHRIST<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S vincit, regnat &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

New Silver-coyn alſo ſhould be made; the pieces called <hi>Monarques,</hi> or <hi>Dieudonnes,</hi> or ſome other names; in them the Figure of the King crowned after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Antiquity, with the Title <hi>Ludovicus XIV. Franciae Rex:</hi> on the reverſe, a Croſs with Fleurdelizes, and the ordinary Inſcription. Of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:109071:64"/>
theſe pieces there muſt be ſome of twelve De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers, others of two Sous, ſix Deniers: others of five Sous, of ten Sous, of twenty, of forty. And to have matter for them, all Loueſes of ſixty muſt be forthwith prohibited: becauſe a multitude of falſe ones go abroad. Afterward, the Loueſes of thirty Sous, made any where but at <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhall be call'd in; and there muſt the new Coyns be alſo made. They will be well received by the People; for that every one hath an extream affection for the King; and becauſe in <hi>France</hi> we account by Livres, or Franks, and have no ſuch Money; the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decues being no longer current. This new Coyning of Money is likely to bring a great deal into the Kings Coffers.</p>
                     <p>Gold and Silver muſt be held in <hi>France</hi> at an higher rate than they bear among Strangers; that we may draw it hither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nothing hath brought us ſo much Gold from <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and other Countries, as the permiſſion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time grantéd, that light pieces ſhould paſs. The ſame thing ſhould be done awhile, for once again: it would cauſe all Foreigners to come and take off our Wines, our Linnen, and our Corn.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould not forget to ſay, as I put an end to this Chapter, that the Maſters of Accompts, the Correctors and Auditors, having wages of the King, ought not to take any other Salary for any thing they do, that directly refers to His Majeſties ſervice; I mean, for the Accompts of the Treaſurers of the Reſerve, and other Accomptable Officers: for they are paid for this by their wages: practiſing in the manner
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:109071:65"/>
they do, they take, as the ſaying is, two Tolls of one griſt.</p>
                     <p>I ſaid, that it was not at all juſt, that the Maſters of Accounts, Auditors, and Correctors, take Fees for the Accounts they examine, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as they receive Wages and Privileges from the King: alſo this Cuſtom was anciently practis'd, and this would be to reduce things to the primitive State. I well know, that the pretence of theſe Fees is founded upon the creation of ſome Chamber of Accouuts, where thoſe payments are made that never go to the Chamber; but this pretext is frivolous; for the Chambers of Accompts in <hi>Montpellier,</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, ought not in like mauner to take any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for examining the Accounts of the King: ſo theſe new Chambers take away no Money from that at <hi>Paris,</hi> that peradventure takes from them the homages, and the verification of gifts; but in this the Clerks only are the looſers, and the Maſter Auditors and Correctors are not concern'd.</p>

                     <p>EIther Calm or Storm, if perpetual, would alike unfit the Sea for Navigation. The Waves muſt not rage, and ſwallow up the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels they ſhould bear: but there muſt be Wind enough to fill the Sails, and give convenient motion; nay ſome little Tempeſts are of uſe to quicken the Pilots skill; whom continual fair weather would entice into a dangerous idleneſs. Juſt ſo is it neceſſary, that there ſtill be, in a great State, eſpecially in Nations of the <hi>French</hi> temper, ſome moderate agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that the noiſe of Arms produce an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon them, like that of the Winds upon the Sea. Peace, by general conſent, is that at which all Politicians do aim; nor can it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd to be preferrable to War, being natural, as Liberty is. Yet War hath its peculiar ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; and thoſe to ſuch a degree, that we
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:109071:66"/>
may account it to be of Divine Right. To ſay true, what other right did GOD give His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt the Kings of <hi>Canaan?</hi> In ſhort, War makes the Peace of Kingdoms the more firm, as a Storm cauſeth the Air to reſume a more ſetled ſerenity. The prudence of Laws therefore ſhould have provided Expedients for the preſervation of States in each of theſe ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: and the Wiſdom of Legiſlators hath been juſtly taxed, in that they have not ſufficiently thought upon this proviſion.

In ſum, the Mythologiſts repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting this Goddeſs armed, and bearing both the Shield and Thunder-bolt of <hi>Jupiter</hi> her Father, do therein let us know, that the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of a good King ought to ſerve Him both for Peace and War. And ſuch was the manner of teaching, in deepeſt and moſt remote Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: Philoſophy then but growing up, and baſhful, durſt not ſhew her full luſtre unto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd and ignorant men, to whom She was yet very much a Stranger. She accoſted them veiled with the ſhadows of Fable; and went ſoftly and ſecretly about the preparing of their reaſon to receive her illuminations and inſtructions. But to return to our ſimilitude; A Storm doth not reach to the whole extent of the Ocean; and whatever Tumults be in ſome part of a Kingdom, yet the whole doth not ſo feel the ſhock of War, but that in others, Peace ſubſiſts; ſo as the Glory of Arms, and the Contentments of a full Tranquility, may
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:109071:66"/>
be had together. Nevertheleſs, ſince theſe two different times do require like different cares; each of which were enough to take up the whole application of an excellent King; it is expedient to conſider them ſeverally.</p>
                     <p>Peace is undoubtedly proper for the Cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Arts and Sciences. Knowing Men there muſt be in a Common-wealth; it being neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that there ſhould be good Men. For knowledge 'tis that enlightens our Soul, ſhews us Virtue, and inflames us with deſire to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs it. I joyn Sciences here and Arts; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſſible that Men ſhould have the one without the other. For as they are Images of GOD, they are mov'd by a natural propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to produce one thing or other; ſo that having acquired general Speculative Principles, they neceſſarily deſcend to Practical operations, which are perform'd by particular Rules, from whence Arts take their riſe. This is done during a Calm; then the Soul, not interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any violent agitation, enjoys, and by reflections, which by its leiſure and repoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to make, views its ſelf. 'Tis in theſe precious hours that it may come to know the Dignity of its Original, and be aſſured of its Immortality. At ſuch a time, having and keeping its faculties united, it gathers the fruit of a ſolid Wiſdom; which is unto the Soul, as the Sun is to the Eyes of the body; and being of all goods the greateſt, communicates its ſelf in precepts; whereof Law is the abſtract and conſummation, giving the ſame ſpirit to all the People.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:109071:67"/>To proceed: it is important, that Cities be enrich'd with publick Buildings, as Temples, Palaces, and other ſumptuous Edifices; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe People have, by that means, the more affection for their Country. The <hi>Trojans</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretting their defeat, were griev'd more for the ruine of <hi>Troy,</hi> than the ſubverſion of its Empire. And the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Babylon</hi> lamented the demoliſhing of the Temple, where they had offered their ſacrifices, more than they did the loſs of their Liberty. This affection of People for their Country, is likewiſe augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the contentment they receive in it; and this Maxim was a principal reaſon why the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> exhibited to their Subjects publick ſhews.</p>
                     <p>'Tis in a time of Peace that a Prince ſhould prepare His Forces for War: yea, He ought to be always in Arms, they being the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of His Royal Majeſty, and ſupport of the Laws. A People not armed does degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; and we ſee, that Nations heretofore eminently redoubtable, are now bankrupt as to Valour and Reputation. <hi>Croeſus</hi> after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, counſelled <hi>Cyrus</hi> His Conqueror, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for the Favour which had been ſhewed him, to diſarm the <hi>Lydians,</hi> and promote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them Muſick, good Cheer, and Pleaſures: ſo they would never revolt, nor fail of obeying His Command. This Counſel of <hi>Croeſus</hi> was really good: For by that means the Inhabitants of <hi>Lydia</hi> loſt their former love for War, and forgat their ancient virtue. Yet it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that Arms, which are the Kings, (for He hath the power of the Sword) ſhould be
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:109071:67"/>
in the hands of all private Perſons alike: and the difference between a Citizen and a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a Soldier and a Country-Labourer, not be diſcern'd: Arms therefore muſt be in their hands whom the King intends for that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and He being every ones Protector, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing all by His Authority, all others muſt be expreſly forbidden to bear any, without His permiſſion, upon pretence of Hunting, or Journey, or Enemies: and this upon pain of being Fined, and in caſe of reiterated Offence, ſent to the Gallies. Theſe Penalties too muſt not be meerly comminatory, but as they term it, <hi>Legal,</hi> and of indiſpenſible neceſſity. Not that Gentlemen ſhould all be depriv'd of the liberty to wear a Sword: on the contrary, 'tis fit to be injoyn'd them, that they never neglect to do it; becauſe it is the mark of their Quality, and continually minds them of the Virtue of their Anceſtors. It may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited them to carry Fire-arms; yet 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to permit them to keep in their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Muſquers, Fire-locks, Piſtols, and other Arms; for that they naturally are Defenders of the State, and by conſequence ought to be furniſh'd for any occaſion that may be offered. For the ſame reaſon 'tis meet that Gentlemen be enjoyn'd to keep their Stables ſtor'd with good Horſes, to breed up and manage a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them for their Service in War. But to this end, the uſe of <hi>German</hi> Horſes for the Coach, muſt be forbidden, and none of them ſuffered to come into <hi>France:</hi> but Mares only for breed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="126" facs="tcp:109071:68"/>Lawyers, Eccleſiaſticks, Citizens, Merchants, Artificers, Husbandmen, ſhould never wear a Sword, becauſe 'tis not their Profeſſion; and I would as much approve a Gentleman's fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying to wear a Lawyers Gown, or a Prieſts Caſſock. But that no ſuch perſon do abuſe this Honourable mark, it muſt be ordained as a fundamental Law of Honour, that whoever ſtrikes with a Sword, a Man, who, (not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch profeſſion) has none, ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared actually fallen from all Honour, and as a very <hi>Plebeian,</hi> yea Villain, (to uſe the old word) deprav'd from all Gentility, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to the rank of a Labourer.</p>
                     <p>Since Arms are the Kings, as I ſaid, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that there be Magazines in divers parts of the Kingdom: they, committed to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody of ſafe Hands, and perſons of unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Fidelity: in them a ſtore of all ſorts of Arms Offenſive and Defenſive; ready fix'd, to Arm 40000 Men. There ſhould be Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page for Horſes, Boots, Spurrs; One of theſe Magazines ſhould be plac'd at <hi>Paris,</hi> to cover <hi>Picardy, Champagne</hi> and <hi>Normandy.</hi> One at <hi>Lion,</hi> for any occaſion that might happen on the ſide of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> of <hi>Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerland,</hi> or the <hi>Franche Comte.</hi> One at <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe,</hi> or ſome other City of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> for all that might be apprehended from <hi>Spain,</hi> or the Sea of <hi>Guyenne.</hi> And one at <hi>Angers,</hi> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Coaſts of <hi>Bretagne,</hi> and <hi>Poictou.</hi> There need be beſide theſe, two Arſenals for the Sea; which I ſhall ſpeak of in their place. It will be neceſſary to have in the Magazines a good number of Cannon for Battery, and of Field-pieces
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:109071:68"/>
ready mounted with Powder, Ball, and Equipage for the Horſes of the Train.</p>
                     <p>The King ſhould have, for the ſecurity of his State, ſeveral Fortified Places in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. 'Tis an ill piece of Policy to neglect them; and good heed had need be taken, that he that may chance to win a Battel, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Maſter of the Field, do not at the ſame time become Maſter of the Cities alſo. It is known what Revolutions <hi>England</hi> hath ſuffer'd by it. And on the contrary, <hi>Flanders</hi> clearly ſhews what a Countrey thick ſet with Fortreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is. Yet Exceſs being every where vicious-I would obſerve a mediocrity here. But, above all, there muſt be left no Fortifications in Towns or Caſtles, which belong to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Lords: except the King places in them other Governors than the Proprietors. Theſe kind of Places embolden Perſons of Quality that poſſeſs them, to Declare themſelves, and make Parties in a time of Civil War: what paſs'd at <hi>Tailebourg</hi> in the laſt Troubles, is an example fully authorizing what I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd. I will ſay more of ſtrong Places and Gariſons in the Chapter of the Education of Children.</p>
                     <p>It is not ſufficient to have ſuch ſtrong places, and them well furniſhed with Gariſons and brave Soldiers; unleſs there be given them Captains fit to Command them, and to be their Governors. In each place then there muſt be four ſorts of Officers. The Governor, the King's Lieutenant, the Governor's Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the Major. Theſe all having their Commiſſions from His Majeſty, it is expedient,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:109071:69"/>
that, as far as is poſſible, their bearing Office be limited to a certain time; to the end, that the continuing of 'em longer may be in nature of a recompence for their Services. And they thus attending with the greater diligence to their Duty; I ſhould alſo wiſh, that being continued in employment, they ſhould change place. As for example, That a perſon who hath been the King's Lieutenant three years at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> ſhould go ſerve as Lieutenant-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor at <hi>Peronne,</hi> or elſewhere. Not that ſuch a Change were fit to paſs upon all the Officers of a place at the ſame time. But let their Commiſſions laſt three Years, and every Year one be changed, that they may ſerve together one Year only. It is meet to, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Turks,</hi> that their Commiſſions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, they be kept a Year without employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſee whether there be any complaint againſt them. Theſe alterations would work two effects equally advantagious to the King's Service. The Firſt is, that every one would ſtick to his Duty. The Second, that the King always having ſuch kind of Employments to give, there would be more perſons to hope for them; which would much more ſtrongly engage them to well-doing. The ſame uſage ſhould be introduc'd, if it be poſſible, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Governors, the King's Lieutenants. There is a concluding obſervation to be made; namely, that it being the Cuſtom for Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors to have ſome Companies of Carabines, which they call their Guards; they give them Caſſocks of their own Livery. I would have this Order changed; and that the King ſhould
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:109071:69"/>
every year ſend each Governor a Troop of Horſe to ſerve about him for a Guard; they having the King's Caſſocks as a Badge of their Commiſſion; and their Officers carrying the Staff in preſence of their Governor during their year of ſervice. This would be a means to augment the Authority of the King, and not diminiſh that of the Governors.</p>
                     <p>As to Armies, it cannot be preciſely ſaid of what number of Men they ſhould conſiſt; nor whether they ought to be ſtrongeſt in Horſe or in Foot. This wholly depends upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes that are made, upon the quality of the Country, and nature of the Enemy. I ſhould adviſe, that a Great King do keep Troops on foot, even during Peace, nothing is ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to a State as old Soldiers. <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> after his Victories, did not caſhier the Forty <hi>Roman</hi> Legions; which prov'd to be the ſafety of the Empire. <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> on the contrary, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded them; and thence came, in the iſſue, the diſſolution of the Power of the <hi>Romans Auguſtus</hi> however, and the other <hi>Caeſars,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a great fault in keeping the <hi>Pretorians</hi> in a Body, for the Grandeur of their Perſons; and Hiſtory tells us what lamentable changes they made in the ſucceſſion of the Emperors. The <hi>Turks</hi> have fallen into like diſaſters by following the like uſage. I ſhould therefore judge it expedient to divide the Troops into ſeveral Quarters, and keep them in far diſtant Gariſons. The ancient Kings of <hi>Aegypt</hi> had a great many Soldiers perpetually in Pay, and were always apprehenſive of their Inſtructions: but found a way to ſecure themſelves from all
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:109071:70"/>
ſuch Seditions of their Armies. Dividing them into Bodies, according to the diverſity of Nations, they gave them different Enſigns; as for inſtance, to ſome a Crocodile; to others a Dog; to a third ſort a Cat; and ſo the reſt. Now the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> being hugely Superſtitious, they were eaſily induced to believe, that their Tutelary Deities were included in the figure of thoſe Beaſts which were given them for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; and that they had the ſame Antipathies among them in Heaven, which thoſe Beaſts that repreſented them, had to one another up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth. Thus under a Veil of Religion, thoſe People were poſſeſs'd with an averſion for each other, like thoſe Animals which they had been ordered to carry in their Banners; yet all were cloſe united, and perfectly at ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord for the common defence of the State: ſo nothing could be executed againſt the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Prince; becauſe as ſoon as any ſhould begin to ſtir, the reſt would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately have oppoſed them. Upon this example the King might divide all his Troops by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; and though there ſhould be no enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Religion in the caſe, yet much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage would, without fail, be drawn from thence. For the Nations would ſtrive to out-vie one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, with more zeal and ardor than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments now do. Theſe Regiments themſelves might have names given them from the Arms of their Provinces; as that of the <hi>Bretons</hi> might be called the Regiment of the <hi>Ermine;</hi> that of the <hi>Normans</hi> the Regiment of the <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards, &amp;c. Jutius Caeſar</hi> raiſed a new Legion among the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and gave it the name of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:109071:70"/>
                        <hi>Lark.</hi> But what I ſay in this particular, is but the giving my Opinion. For I am not of the mind, that the order of the Militia ſhould be changed, or Regiments disbanded, which conſiſt of the beſt and moſt War-like Troops that are in the World.</p>
                     <p>'Tis ordinarily a great queſtion; of what Soldiers an Army ſhould be compoſed. We have Subjects and Forreigners. The Subjects are Gentlemen and <hi>Plebeians.</hi> The <hi>Plebeians</hi> are Citizens and Ruſticks. On the other hand, of Forreigners, ſome are the Auxiliary Troops of Allies, which ſerve at the coſt of their own Princes: as when the King ſent ſuccors into <hi>Germany,</hi> and unto the <hi>Hollanders:</hi> Others are Troops that ſerve at the coſt of the State which employs them. The Ancients termed them <hi>Mercinaries.</hi> Such at this time are the <hi>Suiſſers,</hi> and not a few <hi>Germans.</hi> All theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſorts of Soldiers may be uſed, as neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the conjuncture of Affairs requires. The <hi>Romans</hi> did ſo. It is true, by their Treaties of Alliance they always obliged their Allies to ſend them a certain number of Soldiers; but theſe were not incorporated with their Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and it is clear, that Subjects are ever beſt; of Subjects, Gentlemen have ordinarily more courage than others. Of <hi>Plebeians,</hi> thoſe of the Country are to be preferred before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Cities; becauſe Peaſants are more accuſtomed to Labour and Hardſhip than Townſmen are. Auxiliary Troops ſerve but for a time; and often, when ſome continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſervice is demanded of them, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hard conditions. Mercenaries will have
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:109071:71"/>
Money, and care not if a State be ruin'd, ſo themſelves are paid. In fine, Strangers may on the ſuddain change Intereſts and Party; ſo of Friends becoming Enemies; and that in oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of greateſt importance. Mercenaries above all, do ſerve without affection, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſtand it out in Fight unto the utmoſt. They puſh on a Victory indeed, but ſcarce ever win a Battel. In ſhort, Strangers ſhould be as little made uſe of as poſſible: and ſcarce for any other cauſe, but that Enemies might be deprived of their Aid. When Strangers only are taken into Service, the Subjects grow leſs War-like, and the moſt conſiderable of them deſpiſe War, as is done in <hi>Spain;</hi> and extreamly ill done. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were ruined principally by the fault they committed in employing <hi>Numidian</hi> Troops and other Strangers; and not ſending out their own Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens in their Armies.</p>
                     <p>I will not here ſpeak of the Art of War; 'tis a matter that deſerves a Chapter apart. Yet I will ſay curſorily, that the Rules of it change as Time and Seaſons do. We neither attack Places nor defend them, in the very man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that the Ancients did. There is alſo a great deal of difference between their way of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ours; ſo that they had not the Arms which we now uſe. All of precept for the leading of an Army, that faileth not nor chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, is, that Diſcipline be exerciſed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Commanders ſhould never be remiſs.</p>
                     <p>The only School of War, is War it ſelf: and twenty Years experience will better make a great Captain than an hundred Years Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:109071:71"/>
Not but that we have examples of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Command given to perſons, who never were in Armies afore. There are elevated Spirits, to whom nothing is impoſſible; but the inſtances are rare; and 'tis too too hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous a courſe to rely upon them. For a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain muſt have, not only ſpirit and courage, but alſo credit with his Soldiers; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be gotten but by ſervice. In fine, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for a great State to keep War on foot, and Men of Quality muſt be employed in it: to the end there may always be a ſtock of good Soldiers, and a breed of Generals. Theſe two things give a Nation marvellous advantages and eſteem among Foreigners.</p>
                     <p>Though <hi>France</hi> now be a moſt powerful Monarchy, by means of its Extent, of its Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, the Fruitfulneſs of the Soil, the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of its Inhabitants; and though greateſt States have not always moſt ſtrength, as big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Men are not always ſtouteſt; yet were it to be wiſh'd, that the King did add unto his Kingdom, Firſt all the Low Countrys to the <hi>Rhyne.</hi> This Conqueſt would re-ſettle Him in poſſeſſion of the ancient demain of His Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, giving <hi>France</hi> gain its primitive limits. It would make him Maſter of the Northern Seas, and by conſequence, Arbitrator between the Crowns of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark, Poland, &amp;c.</hi> Conqueſt muſt be aſpired to out of a thirſt of Empire, being an unjuſt thing, (if we believe <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> for I would not determine, but that the right of War were a very lawful right, conſonant to what I have ſaid in the beginning of this Chapter;) but the deſire of Conqueſt
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:109071:72"/>
ſhould principally be for the doing of good to all Men; which is the end why GOD gave them Laws. The more Subjects and Power a juſt Prince hath, the better will it be for the World. Secondly, It were convenient that the King had <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> to keep all <hi>Germany</hi> quiet. In the third place, He need have the <hi>Franche</hi> County, to lay a reſtraint upon the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> leaſt dividing themſelves between the Empire and <hi>France,</hi> or ſerving <hi>Spain</hi> in a War there, they ſtrengthen his Enemies. In the fourth place, <hi>Milan</hi> is neceſſary in reſpect of <hi>Italy,</hi> to give the leſſer Sovereigns and Republiques pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and ballance the Power which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath uſurp'd there. In the fifth place, <hi>Genoa</hi> and all its Territory, pertains to the King: nor would the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> have revolted, had it not been for the bad counſel given to <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, to diſcontent <hi>Doria. Genoa</hi> would make the King Maſter of the <hi>Meditera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi> Sea; beſide, thoſe two Acquiſitions would keep the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> lock'd up within <hi>French</hi> Territories: So he would never depart from the King's Service, being entirely His depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant. We muſt re-enter the Iſle of <hi>Elba,</hi> and into <hi>Portolongone,</hi> and <hi>Piombino,</hi> on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, to drive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of <hi>Italy.</hi> Here our nearneſs would keep the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Parma,</hi> of <hi>Modena,</hi> and of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> and even the State of the Pope, in a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for <hi>France. Corſica</hi> would not ſtand out after the reduction of <hi>Genoa;</hi> and then <hi>Sardinia</hi> would be no difficult Conqueſt. This would ſtrongly favour any ſtirs on the account of Liberty or Diſcontent that might be raiſed
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:109071:72"/>
in the Kingdoms of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples:</hi> nor would it be an hard matter to raiſe them in time.</p>
                     <p>On the Coaſt of <hi>Bayonne</hi> there would be need of <hi>Fuentaravia;</hi> and thoſe parts of the Kingdom of <hi>Navarr</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have in poſſeſſion, might be juſtly re-demanded. The King might alſo carry His Arms into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonia:</hi> we have ancient pretenſions there; and the Conqueſts of it would be no leſs eaſily atchieved than it was in the time of the laſt War. <hi>Majorca</hi> and <hi>Minorca</hi> would follow without trouble. Thus the King would be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Umpire of the Mediterranean, and of all the fortune of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> If it ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen one day that the Queen, or Her Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, ſhould have an Hereditary Right there, the King would be in a condition to do Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf reaſon in theſe matters. The means of making theſe Conqueſts ſeverally, cannot be ſhewed without particular diſcourſes.</p>
                     <p>Mean time, what I have ſaid is not, in truth, to be done in a day: it would be an enterpriſe of many years. Yet there is nothing of meer fancy it it. I propoſe no Conqueſt to be made but what hath really been made, except that of the Iſles of the Mediterranean, which our Kings never minded; for that before <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth they never were in caſe to ſtrengthen themſelves at Sea. <hi>Bretagnie</hi> was ſeparted from the Kingdom, the Wars of <hi>Italy</hi> took up every Reign unto <hi>Henry</hi> the Second. Then follow'd the affairs of Religion, which put a ſtop to all the deſigns that might have been formed in this behalf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="136" facs="tcp:109071:73"/>Here one thing I ſuggeſted in the precedent Chapter, is to be remembred; namely, That Conqueſts do afford a State one expedient to get Money. In this the <hi>Roman</hi> Captains are to be imitated; who made it a point of Glory to lay up extraordinary ſums in the Publick Treaſury; and their Triumphs were as illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by the wealth they brought home with them, as by the Enemies they had defeated in their Expeditions. It would be very material therefore, that Generals ſhould account it a Glory to them, to bring the Spoils of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies unto the profit of the King and Kingdom; or at leaſt make the Conquered Countrys main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and pay their Armies. But the difficulty is not to make Conqueſts; the Arms of the <hi>French</hi> will be Victorious wherever they appear. All the trouble is to find out the ſecret how to keep what hath been gotten. It is fit to ſay ſomething on this particular.</p>
                     <p>The means to preſerve Conquer'd Countrys which the Ancients uſed, and that with good ſucceſs, are in a manner theſe. Tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſhiftings of the People. As when the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> led away the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>Babylon.</hi> The taking away of their Money, of their richeſt Goods, their Antiquities, their Holy Things and things of Religion; as was done with the ancient Idol-gods, and as the Ark of the Covenant, the Tables of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> holy Writings, were dealt withall. The ſame for ſubſtance might be done among us, by ſhifting of Saints Reliques and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Images. The leading away of the ableſt Men, and ſuch as have greateſt credit with the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:109071:73"/>
People. So did the <hi>Romans</hi> when they carried ſome of the <hi>Greeks</hi> out of their Country to <hi>Rome,</hi> and treated them there with all poſſible kindneſs and civility. In like manner as to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers: the <hi>Turks</hi> drew at one time 30000 Work-men out of <hi>Perſia.</hi> The <hi>Romans,</hi> out of their Enemies whom they had vanquiſh'd and taken in War, reſerved thoſe whom they thought ſtouteſt, and made them fight on the Theatre, the People being Spectators, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying them by that means. Chriſtianity ſuffers not ſuch inhumanity. Slavery was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way practis'd in the caſe of Priſoners of War, and the ranſom we make them pay, is an Image of that old Cuſtom. Some People to this day ſtay their Priſoners, or ſend them away to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, after the faſhion of the Ancients.</p>
                     <p>To proceed, other means in reference to conquer'd Countrys are, the mixing of the old and new Subjects by Marriage, the Conquerors accommodating themſelves to the manners of the Conquered, taking up their modes, eating with them, as <hi>Alexander</hi> demeaned himſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Perſians.</hi> Then again, the ruining the Fortifications of their Towns; the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Hoſtages of them: the taking away their Arms, and keeping them weak; the abſtaining from their Wives; the giving them no jealouſie in matter of Love. To have little converſe with them, eſpecially in their Houſes; and when any is, to ſee it be with ſeriouſneſs and decency; to honour them; to do them a pleaſure on occaſion; not play with them; not pick any quarrel with them: not touch their Liberty, nor the Goods that have been
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:109071:74"/>
left them: not diſquiet them for matters of Religion. To do them Juſtice, maintain them in their Laws and Cuſtoms, and in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Government, as the <hi>Romans</hi> did; who permitted the People whom they had ſubdued, to have their accuſtomed Laws To be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fedent of them, and ſhew a confiderde in them. To appear not deſirous of their ſecrets: not interrupt them in their pleaſures: make them pay the Tribute agreed upon with them exactly, not at all augmenting it. To keep word with them in all things, ſeldom meddle in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, except it be to accord them: to lend them no Money; but owe them ſome, and punctually pay the Intereſts of it: not let them know the true State of affairs; not give them entrance into ſtrong holds; which muſt always be well furniſh'd with Men and Proviſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the Governor never come among them without being ſtrongeſt, or having Hoſtages. To prevent their aſſembling, and hinder as much as may be their having Commerce with Neighbours that are under another Prince's Dominion: to keep off all kind Strangers from Houſes, and ſeverely puniſh ſuch of 'em as ſhall cauſe the leaſt trouble, or any motion that may tend to Sedition. If our Conquerors had practis'd in this manner, <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> would have been <hi>French</hi> to this day.</p>

                        <p>Of the Sea, and its uſefulneſs. 2. Means to augment the Kings Power there. 3. Of Commerce. 4. Of Colonies.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Water of the Sea are wholly obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the humorouſneſs of Fortune; and the Wind that governs them turneth and changeth with as much inconſtancy as that blind Goddeſs. Yet it is certain, that thoſe States whoſe renown is greateſt in Story, did not eſtabliſh their ſupreme Dominion, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the power they attained to at Sea: as if Virtue, ſtout and undaunted, had reſolv'd to Combat and Conquer her Enemy in the very ſeat of her Empire. The <hi>Romans</hi> are one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, (whoſe example is ever to be follow'd with as peculiar a diligence, as their conduct of matters was with ſingular wiſdom, and hard to be imitated:) They impoſed not upon the World their Laws, till they had forced the Seas to receive and acknowledge them. Had they not ſet out War-like Fleets, they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accompliſhed their glorious Deſigns; they had never extended their Frontier beyond <hi>Italy;</hi> never brought down the Pride of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage;</hi> nor Triumphed over all the Crowns on Earth. The <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and the <hi>Grecians,</hi> conſidered the Sea as the principal ſupport of their Domination. <hi>Xerxes</hi> having caus'd the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:109071:75"/>
termed it) with Stripes, accounted his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſatisfy'd in the ſight of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> which he drew after him into <hi>Greece,</hi> with ſo much Magnificence and Pomp, that it ſeemed as if <hi>Jupiter</hi> Himſelf was come down from Heaven. The <hi>Venetians</hi> ſtill renew every year their Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with this Element, by an old fond ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Cuſtom, caſting into the Sea a Ring, as if they eſpouſed it: perhaps by this uſe they would inform all the particular Subjects of their Common wealth, that they ſhould be content with the inconſtancy and infidelity of their Women, ſince the State of eſpouſing the Sea, eſpouſeth inconſtancy and infidelity it ſelf. The Riches of <hi>Tunis,</hi> of <hi>Algier,</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> plainly prove the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity there is for Princes to be Strong at Sea, and do ſhew the Profit which does thence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue. Theſe are petty States, yet dare mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their Forces with thoſe of the Greateſt Monarchs. The former of them are <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Slaves, the others revolted Burghers; and how inſolent ſoever the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are, they muſt confeſs, that all the Brittiſh Iſles laid together, do not equal the half of our Continent, either in Extent, or in Fruitfulneſs of Ground, or for Commodiouſneſs of Scituation, or in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men; in Wealth, in Valour, Induſtry, and Underſtanding; yet they fear not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm themſelves Sovereigns of the Sea. Had they caſt up the Wracks they have ſuffered, and the Battles they have loſt; had they well examin'd our Ports and Havens: in fine, had they compar'd the Coaſts of <hi>France</hi> with thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> they would condemn their Vanity,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:109071:75"/>
as <hi>Canutus,</hi> one of their ancient Kings, did.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, all States are not diſpoſed unto Navigation: either becauſe they are too far up in Midland Countries, or becauſe the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the People ſuits not with it; or becauſe they want Subjects: but 'tis ſo far, that any of theſe Obſtacles ſhould hinder the <hi>French</hi> from addicting themſelves unto it; that on the contrary, all things conſpire to raiſe deſire of it in them; and to give them hope of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous ſucceſs. The work however is ſuch as muſt be leiſurably carried on, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by little and little; ſo great a deſign continually allarming <hi>Europe, Aſia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> Friends and Foes. A precipitation of it would be its ruine. I ſay not what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Veſſels would be fit for <hi>France</hi> to put to Sea. But I affirm that the King may keep an hundred Gallies, and an hundred Ships on the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi> and a Fleet of Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Sail upon the Ocean. The more Veſſels He ſhall have, the more enabled He will be to recover the expence made about 'em. As to the building of ſuch numbers ſix or ten years of time may be allotted for it: and there is Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in <hi>France,</hi> there is Cordage, there are Sails; there is Iron and Braſs; there are Victuals and Workmen; ſo that the King's Subjects will gain the Money which is laid out in 'em. Is it not far better for the King of <hi>France</hi> to build Ships for the employing and enriching of His Subjects, than it was for the Kings of <hi>Aegypt</hi> to build their uſeleſs Pyramids? There need be no anxious enquiry whence a Stock ſhould riſe for this advance; every year will
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:109071:76"/>
bring in Money; and the Veſſels once made, and their Guns mounted, it will not coſt the King a Quardecu for other Equippings. 'Twill be but to give the Captains Places in the Ships and Gallies, on condition to fit them out; and there will more perſons come to take them, than there will be Offices and Places to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed. 'Tis true, Fleets being out, there will need vaſt Sums to maintain them: but the Sea will yield a maintenance for the Sea, either by Commerce or by War. Neither will it be always proper to keep ſo many Veſſels in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. On the other hand, it will not be neceſſary to have ſo many Troops at Land as are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. For <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italy</hi> will not dare to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſh themſelves of their Men; ſo there will be no need of a Land-Army but towards <hi>Germany.</hi> The number of Rowers will be made up by bringing Men from <hi>Canada,</hi> and the <hi>American</hi> Iſlands: or by buying Negroes at <hi>Cape Verde:</hi> or by ſending all Malefactors to the Gallies. And when things have taken their courſe, Seamen will be had; time, and the profit that will accrue, will afford ſtore, and bring them in from all parts of the World.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon the Corſairs of <hi>Algiers, Tunis</hi> and <hi>Tripoli;</hi> will not be able to keep at Sea; and the <hi>French</hi> being continually on their Coaſts, they will be conſtrain'd to tarry at home for the guarding of their Towns: ſo not in a condition to ſend out Troops for col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the Tribute which they exact of the <hi>Arabs,</hi> and Princes who lye further up in <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca;</hi> the Tributaries will, without fail, revolt: and the King may in the ſequel, Treat with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:109071:76"/>
them for their recovering their Liberty, and take them into his Protection, There is no cauſe to fear the Power of the <hi>Ottoman Port</hi> in this particular. For beſide that the <hi>Turks</hi> are no good Seamen, the Grand Signior doth make no ſuch account of the Pyrats of <hi>Algier,</hi> as that their fortune is conſiderable to Him. The Friendſhip of the <hi>French</hi> is more neceſſary for Him, both in point of Commerce, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to other Intereſts.</p>
                     <p>The Fleets which the King might keep upon the Ocean, would make Him Maſter of all the Powers and Trade of the North. Yea, though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſhould unite againſt <hi>France,</hi> they could not avoid their ruin in the end. For how ſhould the one and the other make good their Commerce, which is all they have to truſt to, if they were forced to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain great Armada's to continue it? The point of <hi>Bretannie</hi> is the Gate to enter into, and go out of the <hi>Channel.</hi> Fifty Ships of War at <hi>Breſt</hi> would keep this Gate faſt ſhut; and they ſhould not open it but by the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> would not be able to attempt any thing but by His permiſſion, if there were kept a Fleet on the Coaſt of <hi>Guyenne.</hi> Thus there would need no War al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to be made for all theſe things; nor His Majeſties Forces hazarded. It would be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to give his Order to Forreiners. Nor will it be difficult to cut them out work in their own Countries, and by this means ſtay their Arms at home, and make them ſpend their ſtrength there. I ſhall ſomething of this in its place hereafter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="144" facs="tcp:109071:77"/>There is one further excellent means to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the King at Sea: and it is the taking Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that no more of His Subjects go to <hi>Malta.</hi> To do this, there muſt be given in Fee to the <hi>French</hi> Knights of <hi>St. John of Jeruſalem,</hi> ſome Iſle in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> as for Inſtance, the <hi>Iſle du Levant,</hi> for which they ſhould pay an acknowledgment to the King, as they do for <hi>Malta</hi> to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> There might be given them too on the ſame condition, an Iſle in the Ocean, as <hi>Beſle-Iſle, l'Iſle-Dieu,</hi> or the <hi>Iſle of Ree:</hi> ſo that the <hi>French</hi> Knights fighting not but againſt the Enemies of their Country, they would make War upon the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> as upon <hi>Turks;</hi> and keep the Iſlands at their own charge, whereas the King is fain to keep great Gariſons, and be at vaſt expence to do it. There is no cauſe to fear that they will ever give the King any trouble: for being <hi>French,</hi> they cannot fail of Affection or Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: and their Kindred, together with the Wealth they have in <hi>France,</hi> will be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Hoſtages to the King, and caution for their Fidelity. This Project is juſt: for of ten parts of the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> no leſs than eight do come from the Commanderies of <hi>France;</hi> and it is eaſie to be put in execution; for there need be only a ſtopping the income of the Commanderies to effect it. The Order in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral will find its advantages in it; both in that there will be an addition made it of two conſiderable Iſlands: and that the King will receive the Knights into a more particular Protection than he hath done hitherto. The number of Commanderies may alſo be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:109071:77"/>
by giving them ſome Maladeries, (or Hoſpitals for the diſeaſed) which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways uſurped by People that have no right to them at all.</p>
                     <p>Be it obſerved in the laſt place, that it is very requiſite the Office of Admiral, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Admiralty, ſhould be united to the Crown. It hath been an ill Policy in <hi>France,</hi> and a Diminution of the King's Authority, to communicate unto a Subject ſo much of His Soveraignty at Sea as hath been done. He muſt reſume it to Himſelf, and be every way Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme alone: Then He may appoint a ſelect number, whoſe charge may be to give Him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the State of Maritime concerns; and hold a Council from time to time upon them in His Majeſties Preſence, if He pleaſe to aſſiſt. Theſe Officers ſhall in this Council judge of Prizes, and other Sea-affairs; and when its neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, be Commiſſion'd, ſome of them, to viſit the Ships, and make report, or ſend their acts in Writing concerning them. Other Officers for the Marine ſhall be Military: they, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the King's Orders, and have the conduct of Deſigns and Enterprizes in the uſual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It is important to the King's Service, that the Captains of Ships and Gallies, be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with Dignities and Rewards. There may be created Mareſchals of <hi>France</hi> for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at Sea: as there are for thoſe at Land, with the ſame Honours and Prerogatives. The <hi>Romans</hi> decreed a Triumph for Captains who had been victorious at Sea, and called it a <hi>Naval Triumph.</hi> They gave alſo Naval Crowns, as well as Mural and Civical. Theſe Honours
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:109071:78"/>
would eminently promote the King's intention as to the Marine. There muſt be two Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals erected: One in <hi>Provence,</hi> in ſome Town upon the <hi>Rhoſen,</hi> for what relates to Naval Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions on the <hi>Mediterranean:</hi> another up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the River <hi>Loire,</hi> for all occaſions on the Ocean. By means of theſe two Rivers, it will be eaſie to bring out to Sea all the Veſſels that are builded: and all neceſſary Proviſions and Tackling whatever. Nor need it be feared that any Enemy ſhould get up theſe Rivers: they too may be ſhut up by Bridges, or by Chains, or by Forts.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſties Power thus ſtrongly ſetled on each Sea, it will be eaſie to ſecure Commerce in <hi>France,</hi> and even draw the Merchants thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from all parts. I ſay ſecure Commerce: for till all this be done, it will ever be uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and dangerous. Now 'tis unneceſſary to expatiate here, in proving what profit Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce brings in to moſt potent States; the thing is generally known, and all Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of it. Again, I know not why it hath been ſaid, that Trading is contrary to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; except it be, for that Merchants are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly buſied in ſtudying inventions to get Money, and be in a ſort, Servants to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. The <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> admitted not any Citizen of theirs unto the adminiſtration of Affairs, unleſs he had for Ten whole years ſorborn Merchandizing: becauſe they would not have their principal Magiſtrates accuſtomed to Gain, and expert in the means to do it. Theſe kind of inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being blameable in perſons, who being
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:109071:78"/>
deſtined to great Employments, ought to be above all Conſiderations of private Intereſt.</p>
                     <p>Commerce in every Common-wealth ought to take its meaſure from the temper of the People, from their ſtrength, their wealth, the fertility of their Grounds, and the ſituation of their Country. Therefore Order muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that things traded in be uſeful, and in a manner, neceſſary. For it is a rule in Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, that a Man ſpend not his Money in what is pleaſing, though he needs it, but only in what is abſolutely neceſſary. But neceſſity is ſtated by the Birth, the Dignity, and the Eſtate of Perſons; as for example, noble Furniture is neceſſary for a great Lord; not ſo, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meaner Gentleman: and thus in othes caſes, proportionably ſtill to the rank and fortune of Men. It muſt be ſtudiouſly prevented, that Commerce introduce not into a State, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity, Exceſs and Luxury; which are often fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with Ambition, Avarice, and a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous corruption of Manners. And foraſmuch as it is not ſufficient to Commerce, that there be people to Sell, but Merchants muſt be had to buy, otherwiſe no Wares can go off; in which all the advantage of Trade doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt: it is meet, that Traders furniſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelve, with neceſſaries, rather than with things that meerly tend to Eaſe, or Magnificence. Among neceſſaries, thoſe make up the firſt rank, which do ſuſtain Life it ſelf; the ſecond is of them that are for convenience; others are alſo neceſſary to preſervation from Diſeaſes, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of Time and violence of Enemies, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinals, Dwelling, Arms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="148" facs="tcp:109071:79"/>There is every where a twofold Commerce, which is viſible in <hi>France,</hi> more than in any other part of the World. The Firſt is for things ordinarily found in the Country, ſome of which are ſpent by the Inhabitants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and others tranſported. The Second, for Foreign Merchandiſes. We have in <hi>France,</hi> Wines, Corn, Linnen and Salt, in ſo great a quantity, that we ſend them into the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor Kingdoms; and the quality of them is ſo excellent, that ſtrangers cannot forbear to come and carry them out of our Ports. We have Cattle, Skins, Wooll, Tallow, Oils, and other things neceſſary for Man, of which Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiners export very little, but our ſelves do in a manner ſpend them all: and this is the great wealthineſs of <hi>France,</hi> that we have enough to ſerve our turn without Foreign Merchandiſes; but Forreigners cannot do well without ours. We receive from other Countries, Minerals, Pearls, Precious Stones, Silks, Spices, and what ſeems to be matter of Luxury. Order ſhould be given, that in <hi>France,</hi> the Commodities we have be made uſe of, before any Foreign Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſes be employed: becauſe this Order fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed would bring in the people Money, and take off their Commodities; which would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline every one to fall to the work of his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the whole Kingdom be thereby huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly benefited.</p>
                     <p>It hath been a queſtion offer'd to debate, Whether Traffique in <hi>France</hi> ſhould be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Subjects, or by Forreigners? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reaſons might be produced in the caſe, upon each hand: but to make a ſhort deciſion;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:109071:79"/>
'tis evident, that Foreigners muſt be allowed to gain by our Merchandiſes, if we would have them take them off. For if we carry them home into their Ports, we ſhall make leſs ſales, and be at greater coſt, than if they came to fetch them. Yet that our Merchants may ſhare in the profit, they may enter into Partnerſhip with them, or be their Commiſſioners here, or freight them themſelves, provided, they ſell at ſomewhat cheaper rates, and ſo be content with moderate gain; or take in payment, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, the Foreign Commodities.</p>
                     <p>By means of Commerce, as well as by War, there may be <hi>French</hi> Colonies planted abroad, and ſo the dominion of the King extended, even to far diſtant Countries. All the Nations of the Earth are intermix'd, and may be termed Colonies, ſome of one People, ſome of another: Of as many as are known, few can be affirmed to be originally of the places they inhabit. But to plant Colonies out of danger, they muſt be ſeated in as much nearneſs ſtill as is poſſible: For if they be ſeparated at too great a diſtance, it will be difficult to relieve them: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they may revolt, or ſome one or other make himſelf Maſter of them; and ſo the State will be in danger to loſe its Subjects. Secondly, it is neceſſary, that Colonies be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in ſuch Countrys as are able to maintain the Families, that are deſign'd to make them up: otherwiſe Proviſions, and Money it ſelf, muſt be carried to them, which would cauſe loſs and damage to the Common wealths that ſend 'em. In the third place, the Country ſhould bear things that may yield profit to the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:109071:80"/>
State, which erects the Colony. Fourthly, the Scituation ſhould be ſuch, as the State may have ſuccour, and forces from them, both for War, and for Commerce. In the fifth place, the Country ſhould not be ſo Fertile, and ſo much profit to be there made, that the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Subjects ſhould be drawn thither, and the State drein'd of People, as hath happen'd to <hi>Spain,</hi> by means of the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> In fine, for prevention of the inconveniences, I have mention'd, means muſt be uſed to have always Hoſtages from thoſe of the Colonies, that they may be kept in their duty, and in the greater adherence to the intereſt of the State.</p>

to change the quality of them, is impoſſible This regulation, or amendment, is effected by diſcipline; which can only give an after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the works of Nature, keeping to her foregoing draughts, and deſigns, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating what ſhe hath begun.</p>
                     <p>A principal point then, in reference to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is to know their Genius, that they may not be put out of their natural order, but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in things to which they are Originally bent. The Philoſophers, to make known the difference of capacities, have told us, that as for Souls, ſome are of Gold, others of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, other of Iron; and that as a good Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayor muſt not miſtake himſelf, in diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe three Metals; ſo a good Politician ſhould not fail, in the judgment he makes, of the Children that are in the State: it's a piece of his profeſſion to diſcern, what each of them will be proper for, that the intentions of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be ſortify'd, and poliſhed by precepts.</p>
                     <p>There are no Common-wealths, but have in them Prieſts, Judges, Counſellors of State, Soldiers, Sea men, Merchants, Artificers, Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen; Children muſt be educated for theſe different Profeſſions, and timely enabled to diſcharge them. 'Tis fit, that in the caſe of the younger ſort, Three Ages be diſtinguiſhed. The Firſt, from their Birth, to the end of the Seventh year. The Second, from that Seventh year to the Fourteenth. The Third, from Fourteen unto one and twenty. Childrens firſt Five years ſhould be ſpent in their Nurſing up; and they not diſquieted with any higher documents. 'Tis good, to put them upon
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:109071:81"/>
ſome gentle exerciſe, as they are growing, and cauſe them to endure cold; they will have the more Vigour, by that means. There are ſome Nations, that plunge their Children into run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Water, and give them ſlight Clothing in the midſt of Winter: ſo the ancient <hi>Gauls</hi> are noted-to have done. The bodies of Children muſt be plyed to the acting of all kind of Poſtures, and Motions; this will get them a facility and dexterouſneſs for any thing. After the age of Five years, unto Seven, 'tis conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to tell them ſtories, that may raiſe in them a deſire to do well in that profeſſion to which they ſhall be deſtinated. From Seven years, unto Fourteen, thoſe that are intended to be given to the Church, or to the affairs of Juſtice, or thoſe of the State, ſhould learn Latin, and Greek, becauſe in thoſe Languages, they have the ſource of all the Doctrine they will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to profeſs: as likewiſe after Fourteen, unto One and Twenty, they ſhall be taught Rhetorique, Philoſophy, Theology, Law, or Politicks: which muſt be continued alſo, after that Age in the uſual manner. It is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that Seminaries for Prieſts be erected in every Dioceſs, and our Lords the Biſhops ought to take all poſſible care in it. The young Perſons, that are intended for the Wars, may be taught Italian, Spaniſh, and High Dutch: they that are deſign'd for Trade, ſhould know ſomewhat in thoſe three Languages: but ſuch as are thought on for Commerce, in further diſtant Countrys, ought to Learn the <hi>Arabic,</hi> or the <hi>Sclavonian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> or ſome other of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tongues that are current in <hi>Aſia,</hi> or in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:109071:81"/>
                        <hi>Africa,</hi> as the Latin is in <hi>Europe.</hi> There muſt be publick Profeſſors for theſe Languages, as there are for Latin, and Maſters places en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed at the Publick charge. After fourteen or ſixteen years of Age, the Youths ſhould be diſpos'd of unto places, where they may learn the Art of Traffick. As for thoſe that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd to the Wars, whether Gentlemen, or Plebeians, they ſhould be ſent at fifteen or ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years unto Gariſons, and the skill of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on Horſeback or on Foot, there taught them; and they exerciſed once a weak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly; which would moſt conveniently be done on Sundays and Holy-days. They ſhall be taught to handle the Pike and the Musket, the uſe of the Sword, the Halbard, Partiſan, Broad-ſword, and other Arms; they ſhall be put to Run, and Leap, and Wreſtle. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ordinarily exercis'd their young People; which was very providently done of them. For Strength and Expertneſs is not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained but by long and daily exerciſe. In the Gariſons ſhall be taught Fortification, the Mathematicks, Dancing, Vaulting, Ridiug; and it would do well, to take away Academies and Maſters of Exerciſe, from places not Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd, that the Gariſons may be the Academies, as I may term them, where theſe things are learnt. Yea, to the end, that all ſorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons might betake themſelves to the Gariſons, it ſhould be ordained, that no private Maſters ſhall take any Apprentices, but in Gariſon'd places; and that no one keep a Shop, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe any Trade, in any City of the Kingdom,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:109071:82"/>
without a Teſtimonial from the Governor, that he hath ſerv'd his Apprentiſhip in a Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon Town: as we ſee, that no Phyſicians, or Advocates, are admitted to practiſe, but ſuch as have ſtudied in ſome Univerſity.</p>
                     <p>Order muſt be given, that Maſters cauſe their Lacquies to learn a Trade, and that for this, they give them, after four years ſervice, 200 <hi>Livres,</hi> and a ſuit of Cloaths: or if they ſerve leſs time, a ſum proportionable after that rate. Nor muſt it be ſuffered, that Lacquies have wages given them as is done; becauſe they are ill husbands, and lay up nothing. Their Reward-money muſt be put in a Publick purſe, or into ſome Merchant's hands, who will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible for it. The ſhare of Lacquies that die, will ſerve for other Youths that ſhall be choſen. This would prove an excellent means, for the having of Soldiers: For the Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices would ſerve in their turn, on Military occaſions: they would go upon the Guard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor would this take them off from perfecting their skill in the Calling they had choſen. It would too, be profitable, that poor Soldiers have skill in one handicraft or other, and be made to work at it, whenever they are not on the Guard; by this means, they would avoid idling, and get Money for a ſubſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>The Pariſhes both in Town, and Country, might be obliged to ſet forth and maintain each of them a Soldier or two in Gariſon, giving alſo a ſum for their being taught a Trade at the ſame time. There would be Pariſhes able to maintain a Man and half, others half a Man,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:109071:82"/>
the reſt in proportion to the number of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants in each of them. So the King would have 50000 Men well-nigh in Gariſon, and a Nurſery of Soldiers, without its coſting Him a Quardecu; for none muſt have pay, but old Soldiers: its by taking this courſe, that the <hi>Turks</hi> raiſe their <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and they become their beſt Men, and moſt Warlike.</p>
                     <p>When the young Men have been a while in Gariſon, that is, two or three years, they ſhall be ſent to the Army, if there be War on foot: and all recruits ſhall be rais'd out of the Gariſons: by this means they will be rais'd without any expence at all: for inſtance, if there need a recruit of 4000 Men, each of the Governors ſhall be ordered to ſend, one an hundred, another two hundred: and the Men being drawn out of the Gariſons, new ſupplies ſhall be put in, taken out of the Pariſhes, which ſent the former. Thus the Armies would be alway compos'd of none, but expert Soldiers; which is a matter of exceeding great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. I will not preſcribe, in what Towns, or in how many places, it is fit to ſettle Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons; becauſe this depends on the Kings Will and Pleaſure: and Towns, to be choſen for this purpoſe, need not be nominated; the moſt commodious, and beſt ſcituated are known.</p>
                     <p>As to thoſe that ſhould be deſtin'd for Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice, they might be taken out of the ſame Gariſons; and ſhould be taught principally Navigation: but it would be better, to breed them up in the Ships themſelves, that they might be accuſtomed to the Sea. It is fit that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:109071:83"/>
they ſhould underſtand all the practiſe of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners; and alſo be Handicrafts men, as well as Soldiers: it would be very good, that ſome of the number were Carpenters, or at leaſt each of them ſomewhat skilled in uſe of the Axe and Adice. If Soldiers both at Sea and on Land were Artificers, their Captains, or others might cauſe them to work. They ſhould be paid for what they made, and the Perſon that employed them might fell their work, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in groſs or by retail: as Garments, Shooes, Cloth, Hatts, Gloves; and this would prove hugely beneficial; all the Soldiers would find con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in it, &amp; hardly one of them fall into debauch.</p>
                     <p>When the Youngſters have been ſome time in Gariſon, and are not needed for recruits, they ſhould be ſent home with their Diſcharge and Certificate. Hereupon they may ſet up the Trade they have learned, or addict themſelves to Husbandry, as they ſhould think moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for them. The Country Youth, not choſen by the King's Commiſſioners for the Gariſons, ſhould abide in their Pariſhes, to learn the Art of Husbandry, and be exerciſed in it.</p>
                     <p>A like courſe, as is to be taken with young Men, ſhould alſo be taken with young Women. There muſt be School-Miſtreſſes in every City, publickly pay'd, who may teach them all kind of works: the Maids giving them too, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for a reward. It would do well to uſe means, that Women, and even thoſe of higheſt rank, might count it a ſhame to be unskilfull: work would notably fix their thoughts, and buſy them to excellent good purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="157" facs="tcp:109071:83"/>Of Women I had not yet ſpoken; nor will I ſay, of them, ought more: herein I ſhall Imitate <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and beſides him <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> who both conceiv'd it not poſſible, to give them any Rules, and that their temper was ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious, that they could not endure to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by Law: this is more to be excuſed in <hi>French</hi> Women than in others: 'tis their due to be Miſtreſſes; ſince they may Glory, upon better Title than the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Dames, that they give birth to Men, who are capable of rendring themſelves, by their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Conquerors of all the Earth</p>
                     <p>It ſeems to me a fault, that Maids ſhould be ſuffer'd to Marry at Twelve, and Males at Fourteen, at which Ages the too too indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Laws have fixed the Puberty of the Sexes. For, as to Nature, it is not poſſible but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of thoſe years only muſt extremely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice their Health by Marriage, and ſpend their ſtrength before they have attain'd it. 'Tis the making of young Trees bear Fruit before the time: the Children are without doubt the leſs vigorous for it. How can the Parents give them, what they as yet have not themſelves? Again, Morality and the Laws are concerned in the caſe: the truth is, when a Girl is put ſo young into the poſſeſſion of a Husband, ſhe hath the leſs of baſhfulneſs and Modeſty; nor is Virtue ſo well ſecured for her. Beſides, at this age, neither Man nor Woman is of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to know their Duty: and hence it comes, that the Marriages of perſons ſo young are ordinarily attended with no very ſure Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:109071:84"/>
and Succeſs. Finally, how can the one or the other, take care of the Affairs of an Houſe, being altogether unexperienced? or duly govern their Children, needing Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment themſelves, and having not, by allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Laws, power to diſpoſe of any thing? So that it muſt be ordained, they ſhall not be capable of making a valid contract of Marriage till they have attained, Females, the age of Eighteen years compleat, and Males of Twenty.</p>

                        <p>1. How <hi>France</hi> ſhould act with Forreign Princes, and Firſt with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> 2.

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HAving treated in the precedent Ceapters, of things Internal to the State: I think it reaſonable to ſpeak of Externals and what
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:109071:84"/>
courſe is to be taken in them. For to promote the happineſs of People, and govern them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, 'tis not enough, that you regulate their Lives, and their comportment at home, but their eaſe and well-being muſt be ſecur'd againſt ſtrangers abroad, and principally againſt their Neighbors. Now Intereſt being the prime motive unto all States, we ought to conſider other Nations, either in quality of Friends, or in that of Enemies; ever accounting of them, according to the advantage we may receive from them, or the damage they may do us. As they on their part take no thought of us, but in proportion to what they fear, or to what they hope for from our Arms. Beſides, to treat ſafely with Forreigners, it is neceſſary that we know their Deſigns, their Strength, their Alliances, their Temper, and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Foraſmuch then as <hi>Spain</hi> ſhareth with us, at this time, the Concerns of all <hi>Europe;</hi> and there is not a Power in Chriſtendom, but hath Alliance with the one or the other of theſe two Crowns, it is meet we examine in the firſt place, what meaſures we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Council of <hi>Spain</hi> proceeds with a great deal of ſlowneſs; but always with a great deal of Evenneſs: and ſince the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> put it in their head to get the Dominion over all <hi>Europe:</hi> the ſaid Council hath continually ſteered the ſame courſe. The end which theſe States-men have propos'd to themſelves, has been Tyrannical and Unjuſt; and the means they have made uſe of to attain it, bad, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtive,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:109071:85"/>
and ill-adjuſted, which the declining of their Affairs doth evidently demonſtrate. Our Enemies are always Allies of theirs, either co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly, or openly and declared; juſt in like manner, as they who chuſe the King's Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to be intereſſed with <hi>France,</hi> will be Enemies of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Emperor is Leagu'd with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King by Conſanguinity, and moreover, by reaſons of State. For We are cauſe of fear to the Empire on the North, and towards <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> as We are to <hi>Spain</hi> on the <hi>South,</hi> and towards <hi>Italy.</hi> Of all the other Princes, the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> ſeems faſteſt knit to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> and the Pope would, perhaps, be of the Party, did not his Dignity, of being the common Father of Chriſtians, withhold Him; and if He, as a Temporal Prince, did not alſo apprehend ſome Irruption on our part.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Spain</hi> is a Country yielding little increaſe; either for that the Ground is barren; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Inhabitants neglect to cultivate it. The diſcovery of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of the <hi>Moors</hi> have diſpeopled it. <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and the places in <hi>Italy</hi> are a charge to <hi>Spain,</hi> in time of War: and what is rais'd there doth ſcarce ſuffice to maintain the Armies and Gariſons.</p>
                     <p>Their Government is hard, and ill to be endured; becauſe they are inflexibly ſevere; and the Monks, (whoſe depravation is there at the higheſt pitch) and Inquiſitors, do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext of Religion, exerciſe incredible
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:109071:85"/>
grievances. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are valiant for their Perſons: but Men of Quality deſpiſe the Military Profeſſion, as heretofore the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> did: and the name of Soldier is, in a manner, ignominious with them. They are Idlers, and prefer Pleaſure, and a Gallantry, before any thing, be it ever ſo important, or of greateſt conſequence.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath little Money, and much expenſe to defray. The vanity of the Viceroys and Governors of His places, doth ſpend Him above meaſure. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are preſumptuous, haughty, and provided there be Honour done them, you may treat advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly with them. <hi>Charles</hi> V. had reaſon to ſay, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeem to be wiſe; but are not. Their Forces are not at all to be feared; we ruin'd them in the late War; and the Affairs of <hi>Portugal</hi> have hindred their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering them. The Minority of their King, the Diſcontent of <hi>Don John,</hi> and the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſome Lords upon the particular King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, which compoſe the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, augment its weakneſs. <hi>Sicily</hi> might eaſily make Inſurrection. The <hi>Neapolitans</hi> upon a pretext of Liberty, ſuch a darling in <hi>Italy,</hi> would ſet up for themſelves, if they had ſuccors; and perhaps a new Pope would favour our deſigns there, if he were made to ſee, that it would be no impoſſibility for him to make ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Family King of <hi>Naples,</hi> or joyn that Kingdom to the State of the Church, of which he is poſſeſs'd already.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="162" facs="tcp:109071:86"/>If ever the <hi>Spaniards</hi> be attacked, it muſt be done with force, and all at once, in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf, on the Sea, and on the Coaſt of <hi>Portugal.</hi> This is the beſt method for the <hi>French.</hi> Such a general effort would produce two effects. The Firſt is, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Partiſans would be aſtoniſh'd, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Forces ready to make reſiſtance. The Second, that all their Enemies would reſume Vigor, and might ſet on foot again their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions againſt them. If a through Conqueſt be intended, we muſt not do as was done in the laſt War: muſt not make it our buſineſs to take all their fortifi'd places, one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, or to keep them when taken. But this is a matter fit to be diſcours'd of by it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Portugal,</hi> it's a State, yet under age, and not throughly ſetled: to us, a perpetual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument for weakning the <hi>Spaniard. France</hi> hath nothing to fear on that ſide. It would do well, to convey covertly ſome Troops, or ſums into the Country: and above all, give ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly great hopes unto the <hi>French,</hi> that are in ſervice there, if they made any important enterpriſes upon <hi>Spain,</hi> which would divert their Forces. It would, I ſay, do very well to order ſome Soldiers thither, and 'twere to be wiſh'd, there were ſo many <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> that the Partiſans might not dare to make a Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> for fear of having thoſe ſame <hi>French</hi> for Enemies. The Queen of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> who is <hi>French,</hi> both by Birth, and by Affection, may bear up this Intereſt; and She may be told, that there is a neceſſity of it on
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:109071:86"/>
Her part, and that Her Fortune depends upon it.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be accounted on in all Treating with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that they are every whit as fooliſh as they ſeem to be.</p>
                     <p>The Pope, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Italy,</hi> are of one and the ſame temper. The <hi>Italians</hi> are wiſe and circumſpect: nor ſhould we, but very ſeldom, enter into Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation with them. To reduce them to our intentions, we muſt work by down-right force, they are weak, and (as I have ſaid) Wiſe: they are people for Pleaſure; their Country is the beautifulleſt, and beſt in the World; conſequently they love it, and know their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; they are able to foreſee, and fear the ill that may betide them. The Pope will ever conſider <hi>France,</hi> by reaſon of the County of <hi>Avignon,</hi> of the conſequences of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordat of 1618. and becauſe of the <hi>Janſeniſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> are weakned by their War with the <hi>Turk;</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Mantua,</hi> of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena,</hi> and of <hi>Florence,</hi> and the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> can do nothing that's conſiderable. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> muſt never ſeparate from <hi>France.</hi> We have the entrance into his Eſtates: and a War with us, but of 3 Months, would utterly ruin him: He may be induc'd to hope, that he ſhall be reinſtated in the Principality of <hi>Geneva.</hi> If War be made in <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Italians</hi> muſt not have time given them to look about them. As they are the Wiſeſt, ſo when inur'd to War, they are the braveſt upon Earth. In one word, they are the Maſters of the Univerſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="164" facs="tcp:109071:87"/>The <hi>Swiſſes</hi> are Mercenaries, who will alway ſerve the King for his Money.</p>
                     <p>As for matter of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they have not any Friends: themſelves be a ſort of People without Faith, without Religion, without Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, without any Juſtice at all, of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt levity that can be, Cruel, Impatient, Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonous, Proud, Audacious, Covetous, fit for Handy ſtrokes, and a ſudden execution; but unable to carry on a War with judgment. Their Country is good enough for ſuſtenance of Life, but not rich enough to afford them means for iſſuing forth and making any Conqueſt: accordingly, they never conquered any thing but <hi>Ireland,</hi> whoſe Inhabitants are weak, and ill Soldiers. On the contrary, the <hi>Romans</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd them; then the <hi>Danes,</hi> and the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> in ſuch a manner too, that their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Kings are the Heirs of a Conqueror. They hate one another, and are in continual Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either about Religion, or about the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. A War of <hi>France</hi> for three or four years upon them, would totally ruin them. So, it ſeems reaſonable that we ſhould make no Peace with them, but upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of greateſt advantage for us; unleſs the King think meet to defer the execution of this Project to another time; or that His Majeſty, preſs'd with the love He hath for His own People, do incline to prefer their eaſe, before ſo fair hopes.

                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:109071:87"/>In fine, if we had a mind to ruin the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> we need but oblige them to keep an Army on foot: and there is no fear that they ſhould make any invaſion upon <hi>France;</hi> that would be their undoubted ruin, if they be not call'd in by ſome Rebels. Now if they have an Army, they will infallibly make War upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo ruin themſelves. You muſt put them upon making great expences; and for this end, raiſe a jealouſie in them for the Iſles of <hi>Jerſey</hi> and <hi>Guernſey,</hi> of <hi>Wight</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> for the <hi>Cinque-Ports,</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> and by that means, oblige them to keep ſtrong Gariſons in all thoſe places: this will create a belief in the people that the King formeth great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects againſt their pretended Liberty; and while He is in Arms, His Subjects will hate Him.</p>
                     <p>They muſt be wrought to diſtruſts of one another, by writing Letters in Cypher to ſome particular perſons, and cauſing them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted. For (being ſuſpicious and impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) they will ſoon be perſwaded, that the Letters were ſeriouſly written. Some Forces ſhould be landed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in other parts. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> may be induced to revolt, as having a mortal hatred for the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo will not neglect to ſet themſelves at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Factions muſt be rais'd, and the Sects favoured againſt one another; eſpecially the Catholicks, among whom, the Benedictine Monks in particular, ſhould be ſecretly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd, on the King of <hi>England</hi>'s behalf (wherein it will be eaſie to deceive them) that they ſhall be reſtored to all the Eſtates, which they once
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:109071:88"/>
poſſeſſed in the Iſland, according to the <hi>Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticon</hi> there Printed. Upon this, the Monks will move Heaven and Earth, and the Catholicks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelves. The rumor, which hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy gone abroad, that the King of <hi>England</hi> is a Catholick, muſt be fortifi'd, and ſo all will fall into utter confuſion, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy be in caſe to be divided.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, our League with the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> ſhould be renew'd, and they put into a belief, that we will give them all the Trade ſtill: becauſe they have a through Knowledge of it, and are proper for it; whereas the <hi>French</hi> have no inclination that way, and Nature cannot be forced. They muſt be told, that now they are come to the happy time for advancing their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and ruining their Competitors in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty of the Northen Seas. Beſide theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, if the King give <hi>Belle-Iſle,</hi> or <hi>L'Iſle Dieu,</hi> or the Iſle of <hi>Ree,</hi> to the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> as I have ſaid before, theſe Knights will make irreconcilable War upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> redemand the Commanderies of their Order, and by their courſes, and Piracies, oblige them to keep great Fleets at Sea; which will ruine them, by ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the profit of their Trade. Mean time, the King ſhall increaſe His Strength at Sea; and then finding His Enemies weakned, conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate their Depreſſion, and Subverſion.</p>
                     <p>It is not difficult, to make defence againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enterpriſes of the Emperor; for He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make War upon <hi>France,</hi> though He would: ſuch a War would be too coſtly for Him; and and to make any progreſs in it, He muſt needs
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:109071:88"/>
bring into the Field exceſſive great Armies. But if He armed Him ſo potently, the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> would grow jealous of Him, and make Levies to oppoſe Him, and to hinder His paſſage through their Territories: beſide, His Hereditary Countrys would be disfurniſh'd of Men, and ſo expos'd to the inroads of the <hi>Turks:</hi> ſo that there is no cauſe to apprehend any thing on the part of the Emperor. On the contrary, He hath intentions to give the King content; becauſe He may receive great ſuccors from Him, in Wars with the <hi>Turk,</hi> as happen'd of late Years.</p>
                     <p>The Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> whether Catholicks or Proteſtants, have an equal intereſt to keep themſelves in the King's Protection: for the reaſons I noted afore in the Chapter of the <hi>Huguenots;</hi> ſo that they will always oppoſe the Emperors growing greater, on the ſide of <hi>France:</hi> as it may be, they would oppoſe the deſigns of the King; if He ſhould carry His Arms too far up into <hi>Germany.</hi> 'Tis the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of leſſer States, that the Kings their Neighbours be equal in Power, that the one may maintain them againſt the others.</p>
                     <p>To conclude: the King hath no Allies, whom He ſhould ſo highly eſteem, as the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> there is not a braver Nation, a Nation more open, more honeſt.

                     <hi>I</hi> Took ſo great ſatisfaction in the reading of thoſe your Reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Roman Clergy,</hi> that I have thought I could not better employ my time, than illuſtrating them with a large Comment; and though ſometimes I improvs upon your judgement, and make bold to puſh on ſomewhat farther than you are pleaſed to go, yet ſhall you not find that I have gloſs'd upon your diſcourſe, as ſome Monks have done on the Bible, for I have faithfully confirm'd your Opinion by the Hiſtory of our <hi>France,</hi> and by the wiſe ſayings of the beſt Authors. And if by their help I let you ſee that your Maxims carry you to much higher enterpriſes than your Counſels aim at, this is not to Contradict, but to Aſſiſt you, and per adventure to ſay for rou; what you would have been content to have ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:109071:93"/>
your ſelf. After having thus fought under your Banners, the intereſt of my Party, which in your Fifth Chapter you are ſo hard upon, obliges me to engage in their defence. And I know you are too generous, Sir, to take this ill. But I beſtow not above a Third part of this Diſcourſe on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that you may clearly perceive I have more than double the pleaſure in following your ſteps, than I find in oppoſing you. To return then to my chief deſign, which is, to eſpouſe your quarrel, and take your part againſt the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations of <hi>Rome,</hi> I will ſhew you what more remains to be ſaid on that occaſion, there is a pretty Book called <hi>An Examination of the Powers of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> Chigi, then when he came in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Leg at to His Majeſty. A Book furniſh'd with invincible Reaſons, and a profound knowledge of Antiquity, eſpecially for what concerns our <hi>France.</hi> And from thence I acknowledge to have received ſome of the Authorities that I alledge.

                     <hi>FRance</hi> is much oblig'd to my Lord the Marqueſs of <hi>C.</hi> for having mark'd the many <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations</hi> of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the Rights of our Kings. He has wiſely obſerv'd, <hi>That the Churchmen have attempted, on ſeveral occaſions, to render themſelves Maſters of all the Temporal Juriſdiction. That their obſtinacy has proceeded ſo far, that making advantage of trouble ſome times, they have forced our Kings to Declare in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour upon very unjuſt Conditions, and to yield to them the Rights of</hi> Mortmain <hi>and</hi> Indemnity <hi>for the Lands they poſſeſs.</hi> Whereby the State is ſo much the weaker as they grow in ſtrength, <hi>and that the conceipt of theſe Priviledges is ſo full</hi>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:109071:94"/>
                     <hi>in their Heads, that to this day they can hardly acknowledge the King's Sovereignty. That the multitude of</hi> Monks <hi>is an abuſe of ſo ſenſible, that the King can diſſemble it no longer, and that 'tis high time ſeriouſly and effectually to apply ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. That their blind ſubjection and dependance on the Pope's Will, makes a Foreign Monarchy even in the very boſom of</hi> France. <hi>And that they ſeduce the ſilly credulous People, which is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of pernicious conſequence. That this Policy is founded on the abuſive and deſtructive Maxims of</hi> Rome, <hi>which are meerly Politick. That thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Vows of Obedience to the Pope, and the name of Religion in this caſe, is only a Bugg and vain pretence laid hold on by the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>for promoting their Temporal Power, and making their Creatures in every corner. That the ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Monks, and their rambles from one end of</hi> France <hi>to the other, ſerve only to debauch them with an univerſal acquaintance.</hi> All theſe Obſervations are true and judicious. But the fear that my Lord Marqueſs ſhews of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> or at leaſt, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement he had made, <hi>That it is the Glory of a King to Honour the Holy See,</hi> hinders him from ſounding the bottom of the Evil, and from preſenting the neceſſary remedy. For it may be ſaid of the wholſome Rules that he preſcribes for reducing the Clergy to their Duty, and for preventing of Fraud in matters of Benefices, that this comes to no more, than the paring a Man's Nails when his Skull is broken, and ought to be trepann'd. The great Honour, and the great Intereſt of the King indeed, would be to think of a way, how he may round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:109071:95"/>
ſhake off this infamous and tyrannical Yoke of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, which my Lord Marqueſs calls the <hi>Holy See.</hi> And deliver himſelf from this buzzard Superſtition which rides even our very Stateſmen, <hi>viz.</hi> That there can be no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion Catholick, but in ſubmitting to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Juriſdiction of the Holy. See.</p>
                  <p>Is it becauſe the Pope is the Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt, His Majeſty has a number of Biſhops within His Realm, who, if they underſtand, and do their duty, are the Vicars of Jeſus Chriſt? So that we need not travail over the <hi>Alps</hi> to ſeek one. Inſtead then of <hi>providing a</hi> French <hi>Secretary of Conſcience, who may make a Bank in the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>by which means we might know what Money paſſes from</hi> France <hi>to</hi> Italy, which is the advice of Mounſ. the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, He ſhould rather break the Bank in <hi>France,</hi> and give order that no more Money paſs out of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Italy;</hi> for this Bank is a continual Pump which draws away the faireſt Caſh of <hi>France,</hi> which fattens a ſtranger with our Kingdoms Treaſure, which carries much away, but returns nothing.</p>
                  <p>I know all theſe Tributes and Reſpects are paid to the Pope, becauſe he is ſuppos'd to be the Head of the Church; and his Flatterers tell us, That the Church can no more ſubſiſt without the Pope than the Body without the Head. But that great Chancellor of the Univerſity of <hi>Paris, John Gerſon</hi> was not of this Opinion, for he writ a Book expreſly <hi>De auferribilitate Papa ab Eccleſia.</hi> That is to ſay, to prove that this ſame head might very well be quite taken away, and the Church yet be
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:109071:95"/>
never the worſe, nor take any harm. The Cardinals have ſometimes continued more than two years before they could agree about their Choice of a Pope. During all which time the Body of the Church was without a Head. The Churches of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> did not at all feel the want of it, and matters went ſtill on there as they were wont. Which puts me in mind of the Man of Wood, that being moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on Horſe-back, and coming under a Tree, a bough ſtruck off his head to the ground, yet the heart of Oak kept the Saddle, and trotted on with the company nothing diſmaid, for that the head was not eſſential to the reſt of the body.</p>
                  <p>It is too ſoft an expreſſion to call the Pope an unprofitable Head of the Church, he is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely pernicious to it. I paſs by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals, ſuiting my ſelf herein with the humour of Mounſ. the Marqueſs, who conſiders the Catholick Religion little farther than as it makes for the intereſt of <hi>France.</hi> But what greater miſchief can the Pope do to the Church, than to render the Power of the Church ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to Sovereign Princes, as a pure politick device to invade their Rights, grind their Subjects, and form even an Empire within their Empire.</p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs endeavours with great reaſon to make the King jealous of the Popes Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Monarchy over his Subjects. He might with as good reaſon have mov'd him to be jealous of that Spiritual Monarchy, which is in effect purely Temporal. For he has well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, <hi>That the name of Religion is a falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi>

                     <hi>us'd by the Court of</hi> Rome <hi>to advance his Temporal Power. And that the Popes having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with Letters of Recommendation to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to have an Eye on ſuch an ones mirit to be choſen Biſhop.</hi> Have <hi>after in proceſs of time turn'd theſe Letters Recommendatory to Bulls and Decrres to diſpoſe of the Biſhopricks of</hi> France <hi>at their pleaſure;</hi> which is a Tyranical invaſion of the Rights of the King, and of thoſe of the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Glaber,</hi> who liv'd in the times of <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> relates <hi>lib. 3. cap.</hi> 4. how Pope <hi>John</hi> ſent a Cardinal into <hi>France</hi> to Found and Conſecrate a Monaſtery within the Dioceſs of <hi>Tours;</hi> and that the Prelates of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Hugh</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Tours</hi> oppoſed him, and ſaid roundly, That the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> having a Dioceſs to himſelf, ought not to meddle with the affairs of another Dioceſs, nor ſend his Commands to their Biſhops, who are his fellow Biſhops and Colleagues.</p>
                  <p>The Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> in their <hi>Reſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> publiſh'd at the time of the Appeal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the abuſe about the Breviary of <hi>Anjou,</hi> by the Biſhop of <hi>E<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore in the time of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and even in St. <hi>Anguſtin</hi>'s days, the Popes did write <hi>Ad Coepiſcopos Galliae &amp; Collegas.</hi> Now <hi>Collegue</hi> imports equality of Power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:109071:96"/>And if the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have not any power over the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> they can much leſs pretend to any over our Kings. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> VI. promiſed <hi>Lotharius, diſt. 10. c. 9. can. 10. to obey his Edicts both at preſent and for the future.</hi> Pope <hi>Pelagius</hi> to the like effect to <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debert, The Holy Scriptures,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>command us to obey Kings, and to be ſubject to them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Popes were always humble Subjects of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors ſo long as that Empire continued. And 'tis but the other day that they got free from the Emperors of <hi>Germany<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Onuphrius de varia Creatione Pontif l.</hi> 4. teſtifies, That even then when they were look'd upon as the Succeſſors of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> their Authority reached no farther, but only to maintain and defend the truth of the Doctrines of Faith. And for the reſt were wholly ſubject to the Emperors, who ordered all things according to their wills, and were wont to create the Popes.</p>
                  <p>It is a notable Obſervation the Marqueſs has made, <hi>That the Tables were put into the hands of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and not into the hands of</hi> Aaron, <hi>and that it is the part of Secular Princes, that the People be inſtructed in the Laws of God.</hi> He was entruſted with the firſt Table as well as with the ſecond, to teach us that the care of the Service of God belongs as much to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Prince, as that of Juſtice and Civil Government.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Expreſſions of the Marqueſs, That <hi>Secular Princes are the Protectors of the Church, of its Doctrine, and of its Canons,</hi> are intended by him in a more liberal and ingenious ſenſe, than they meant, from whom he takes them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:109071:97"/>
For they are the ordinary terms of thoſe who make the King ſubject to the Pope, and who own not the King for the Sovereign of the Church, but only for its Protector, and to execute the Commands of his Holineſs, and for that his Canons be obſerved. This is the Stile of my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Montauban. Peter Bertier</hi> in his Remonſtrance made to the King in the City of <hi>Rheims, June 8th,</hi> 1654. where after he had term'd his Sovereign Power a true reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Deity, he ſinks it again not only below the Pope, but even below the Biſhops, who are the Kings ſubjects, ſaying, That the Biſhops are the Head to govern, and the Mouth of the Church to ſpeak, but that the King is its arm, and its right hand to execute its Decrees and Ordinances. This Scholar of the Jeſuits ſpeaks like his Maſters; for all the Jeſuits harp on the ſame ſtring, which <hi>Becanus in Pref. ad Reg. Jac. Kings are only to execute the Popes Commands.</hi> What is the duty of Kings (ſays he) in relation to the Church and to Religion? I will tell you in one word; they ought to guard and defendit, not as Lords but as Servants, not as Judges but as Executioners.</p>
                  <p>And why, I pray, has not the King the ſame Sovereignty in <hi>France,</hi> that the Emperor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> and the Emperor <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> enjoy'd? under whom the Canons of the Synods were none other than counſel and advice, till theſe Emperors had examin'd and authoriz'd them. Did not theſe Sovereigns altogether call and diſſolve thoſe Synods of Biſhops at pleaſure? and wherefore ſhall our Kings be rob'd of that Power? Our great King who ſurpaſſes all his
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:109071:97"/>
Predeceſſors in Glory and Magnanimity, ſhall he ſuffer a ſtranger Biſhop to ſnatch from his Crown this eſſential Right, of governing the Church of his Kingdom, and He of a King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Serjeant to put in execution the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of that Biſhop, and thoſe of the Biſhops his Subjects.</p>
                  <p>The world is well chang'd ſince Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> in his Letters, inſerted in the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> expreſs'd himſelf to the Emperor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> to this effect, <hi>We beſeech your Clemency with ardour of Spirit, and as though we were preſent, we caſt our ſelves at your knees, and lie at your feet, I with my Brethren.</hi> Then it was that Popes kiſſed the Feet of Emperors, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now Emperors kiſs the Popes Toe.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 679. the Pope <hi>Agathon</hi> pray'd the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to diſcharge the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute which the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> pay'd Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to the Emperor for their Conſervation. Very far from compelling the Emperors, the day of their Conſervation, to lay a ſum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney at the Popes feet for Tribute, as a token of ſubjection, which afterwards the Emperors of <hi>Germany</hi> have been oblig'd to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> the Firſt gave a good Example for our Popes at this day, how they ſhould demean themſelves towards the Emperor, for he ſpeaks thus to the Emperor, <hi>l. 3. Ep. 6. I am the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Servant of your pity.</hi> And in the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>Whilſt I ſpeak thus before my Maſters, what am I other than Duſt and a Worm.</hi> And <hi>l. 2. Ep. 61. I am ſubject to your Commands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might bring many Examples how anciently the Chriſtian Emperors, and the Kings of <hi>Italy</hi>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:109071:98"/>
created and depos'd the Popes, commanding them, and depoſing them at their pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Not to go farther than our <hi>France,</hi> there we may ſee what Power our Kings of the firſt Line exercis'd in the Government of the Church. The Hiſtory of <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> may furniſh us with many examples, <hi>l. 4. c.</hi> 5. King <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharius</hi> ſpeaks thus to the Inhabitants of <hi>Tours, Have not I commanded that the Prieſt</hi> Cato <hi>be made a Biſhop? Why are my Commands ſlighted?</hi> and <hi>Chap. 18. Paſcentius</hi> is made Biſhop of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, ex juſſu Regis Chariberti,</hi> by the Command of King <hi>Heribert.</hi> The ſame King being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd, becauſe <hi>Emerius</hi> had been turn'd out of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Xaintes,</hi> cauſed him to be beaten, who came to ſignifie to him that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and made him be drawn upon a Cart loaden with Thorns, into baniſhment, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd <hi>Emerius</hi> to his place from whence he had been caſt out, <hi>l. 6. c. 27.

                  <p>In all theſe paſſages we find no mention of the Pope, nor of <hi>Annates,</hi> nor of Letters of Inveſtiture. For in thoſe days the Biſhops of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:109071:98"/>
                     <hi>Rome</hi> meddl'd not at all with the Election of the Biſhops of <hi>France.</hi> Above all is memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the <hi>Francique Synod,</hi> to be found in the Third Tome of the Councils of the Edition of <hi>Cologne, Pag.</hi> 39.

                  </p>
                  <p>Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the Firſt, by a Council, made this Law to paſs, <hi>That</hi> Charlemain <hi>ſhould have the Right and Power to chooſe the Pope, and to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the</hi> Roman <hi>See.</hi> Which Conſtitution is inſerted in the <hi>Roman Decretal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Council of <hi>Mayence</hi> held under <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, an. 813. diſt. 63. Can. Hadrians,</hi> begins thus, <hi>To</hi> Charles Auguſt, <hi>Rector of the True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Defendor of the Holy Church of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> And the Second Council of <hi>Mayence,</hi> under <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debonnaire, to</hi> Lewis <hi>the moſt Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Rector of the True Religion.</hi> At this day theſe Titles would be counted wicked.</p>
                  <p>Now for all that <hi>Charlemain</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonnaire</hi> have advanc'd the Pope out of meaſure, yet his Authority, even in Spirituals, was no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than precarious, and ſuject to thoſe Kings that were Emperors. For proof of this, <hi>Hinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> relates <hi>l. 55. c.</hi> 20. That the Emperor <hi>Charlemain</hi> did <hi>convoke</hi> a general Synod in <hi>France,</hi> whereby the worſhipping of Images was condemn'd; and the Second Council of <hi>Nice</hi> which defended them, was rejected as a falſe Synod, thô the Pope had approv'd it. And thô at this Synod, convoked by <hi>Charlemain,</hi>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:109071:99"/>
the Authority of the Pope was admitted. For the Hiſtory of thoſe times teaches us, <hi>That</hi> Charlemain, <hi>who had advanced the Pope, made uſe of the Authority given him, to his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, even againſt the Pope himſelf, when he had a mind.</hi> Inſomuch that he was not content to make the Popes Opinion be condemn'd in this Synod aſſembled <hi>(pro forma</hi> at leaſt) by order of the Pope; but he ſent to the Pope a Book, which he writ againſt the Second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and againſt Images, which we have ſtill to this day.</p>
                  <p>After that <hi>Charlemain</hi> had rais'd the Pope, in giving him a good ſhare of the Country, which he had taken from the <hi>Lombards,</hi> the Popes began to be puft up extreamly, and by little and little made themſelves formidable, taking upon them the Figure of Judges and Correctors of the Actions of Princes through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> by Excommunications, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and finally, by the Depoſition of their Crowns. Now 'tis very remarkable, that whereas, by their imaginary Arms they have laid at their feet the Emperors of <hi>Germany</hi> and and the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and brought their Eſtates into a miſerable confuſion, yet had they never the like ſucceſs againſt <hi>France,</hi> they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been able to Depoſe our Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could prevail to have any Interdict re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in their Kingdoms, which ſo often as they attempted, they were mock'd, their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers beaten, and their Partiſans ruin'd. But alas, the Submiſſion which <hi>Henry</hi> the Great made to the Pope (the only Inſtance that we can be reproacht withal) is a cooling caſt in our way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:109071:99"/>Under <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debonnaire</hi> was held at <hi>Paris</hi> a Council againſt Images, that is to ſay, againſt the Pope who maintain'd them. Of which Council we have all the Acts entire. And in the beginning of his Reign <hi>Claudius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Turin</hi> broke down all the Images he could find within his Dioceſs, and liſted himſelf againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who ſtood for their Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and writ a Book againſt Images, and the Pope durſt not be angry, becauſe this Biſhop was ſupported by the Authority of <hi>Lewis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Great Troubles being ſtirr'd in <hi>France, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the Fourth confederates with the Sons of this <hi>Lewis,</hi> too <hi>Debonnaire,</hi> who had engag'd in a wicked Conſpiracy againſt their own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Sigebert</hi> about <hi>an.</hi> 832. teſtifies, That Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> came into <hi>France,</hi> and took part againſt the Emperor with his Sons.

                  <p>After this, Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Firſt Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated King <hi>Lotharius,</hi> (for in thoſe days Depoſing was not talkt on) to make him leave <hi>Waldrade,</hi> and take again <hi>Thetherge</hi> his former Wife. Whereupon, the Articles drawn up by the <hi>French,</hi> and which may be ſeen in <hi>Hine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Bheims</hi> import, <q>That the Biſhops hold that as the King ought not to be Excommunicated by his Biſhops, ſo can he not be judged by other Biſhops: becauſe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:109071:100"/>
he ought to be ſubject to the Empire of God alone, who alone could eſtabliſh him in his Kingdom. Then alſo, the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> writ to the Pope Letters full of hard words, related by <hi>Aventin</hi> in his <hi>Annals</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as to call him Thief, Wolf, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Popes growing in Inſolence, <hi>Adrian</hi> II. took upon him to command King <hi>Charles the Bald</hi> to leave the Kingdom of <hi>Lotharius</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to his Son <hi>Lewis.</hi> The ſame <hi>Hincmar,</hi> a Man of great Authority in his time, writ ſeveral Letters to him, containing many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances on this occaſion, and amongſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> other matters, informs him, <q>That the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and the Seculars of the Realm aſſembled at <hi>Rheims,</hi> have ſaid, and ſay by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, That never was ſuch a Command ſent from that See to any of our Predeceſſors.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He adds, That Biſhops and Secular Lords us'd threatnings againſt the Pope, which he dares not repeat. And for the King's part, ſee how little he valued the Pope's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; amongſt the Epiſtles of the ſaid <hi>Hinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> are to be found the Letters of <hi>Charles the Bald</hi> to Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> wherein, after having charg'd him with Pride and Uſurpation, he adds, <q>What pit of Hell has vomited out this prepoſterous Law?

                  <p>The Pope thus provok'd, Excommunicates the King, but no body durſt publiſh the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, nor be the bearer of it. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the King aſſembles at <hi>Paris,</hi> his Knights, Barons, and Prelates, and demanded of them, of whom they held their Fiefs, and their Church-Temporalties. They anſwered, That they hold them of the King, and not of the Pope, whom they accus'd of Hereſie, Murder, and of other Crimes. In the mean while, the Pope made it his buſineſs to ſtir up <hi>Germany</hi> and the Low Countrys againſt <hi>France.</hi> But the King

ſent into <hi>Italy, William de Nogaret,</hi> who, aſſiſted with the advice of <hi>Sciarra</hi> a <hi>Polander,</hi> took the Pope at <hi>Anagnia,</hi> and having mounted him upon an hurdle, carried him Priſoner to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he died of grief and anger. Obſerve, that this Pope who thundered againſt Kings, had ſo little Power at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo little love of the People, that not a <hi>Roman</hi> ſtirr'd a foot to deliver the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo rudely treated even in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. For all this the King had immediately from the Succeſſors of <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> rare Bulls, for aboliſhing the memory of all theſe Tranſactions; as may be ſeen in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travaganta Meruit</hi> of <hi>Clement</hi> V. where this King is prais'd as a Religious Prince, who had deſerv'd well of the Holy See. For the Popes are of the nature of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who will lick their Maſters feet when they have ſoundly bang'd them.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1408. Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> XIII. angry becauſe <hi>Charles</hi> VI. had expreſs'd the exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and pilferings of the Popes Court, which drain'd <hi>France,</hi> ſends into <hi>France</hi> a Bull of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication againſt the King and his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> Order'd, That theſe Bulls be torn in pieces, and that the Pope <hi>Benedict,</hi> whom they call'd <hi>Peter de Luna,</hi> be declar'd Heretick and Schiſmatick, and Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Peace. And theſe Bulls were torn by the Sentence of the Court, <hi>June</hi> 16. 1408. and ten days after, the Court being riſen, at Eleven a Clock in the Morning, two Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers, who had brought this Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made their honourable Amends upon the ſtairs of the Palace, and after were carried
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:109071:102"/>
back to the <hi>Lovre</hi> in the ſame manner they had been brought (being drawn on two Sledges, adorn'd with Coats of Painted <hi>Canvas,</hi> and Miters of Paper on their heads) with the ſound of Trumpets, and the publick Laughter. So little did they care for the Popes thunder. And what would they have done, if theſe Bulls had brought the Sentence of Depoſition againſt the King? <hi>Charles de Moulin</hi> in his Treatiſe againſt the <hi>Perites Dates,</hi> relates a pretty Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Court againſt the Pope under <hi>Charles</hi> VI.</p>
                  <p>From the ſame vigor of the <hi>French,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Dignity of the Crown of their Kings, are riſen theſe cuſtoms which have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd many Ages, that a Legate of the Pope is not receiv'd in <hi>France,</hi> nor any Reſcript, nor Command of the Pope, without the Kings leave, and without that the Legate communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Powers to the Kings Procurator-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and that they be view'd and verified in the Court of Parliament, who modifie and and reſtrain them to Maſters that do not dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the Rights of the King, the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Church, nor the Ordinances Royal. Againſt which ancient form Cardinal <hi>Balui</hi> being come into <hi>France an.</hi> 1484. and there acting as a Legate without the Kings permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Court, at the requeſt of the Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor-General, decreed a Commiſſion for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to be brought againſt him by two Counſellors of the Court, and did forbid him to uſe farther any Faculty or Legantine Power, on pain of being declared Rebel.</p>

                     <hi>An.</hi> 1510. the <hi>Gallican</hi>-Church being aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Tours,</hi> it was concluded, That the King <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. might with a good Conſcience diſpiſe the abuſive Bulls and unjuſt Cenſures of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> II. and might by Arms oppoſe his Uſurpations, though the Pope ſhould go on to excommunicate, or to depoſe him. Which is more, by a Council held at <hi>Piſa,</hi> he declar'd himſelf fallen from the Papacy, and caus'd Money to be coin'd with this Inſcription around it. <hi>Perdam nomen Babylonis.</hi> There is ſome reaſon to believe he would have made good his word, had he been 30 years younger. And we hope that God has reſerv'd this Glory for another <hi>Lewis</hi> in our days, who with the vigour of a flouriſhing Youth, has the prudence of an old <hi>Cato;</hi> as alſo the courage and fortune of an <hi>Alexander.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. and his Adherents were depos'd, <hi>John D'Albert,</hi> King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangl'd with the ſame misfortune, whoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by this Pope <hi>Julius</hi> II. was given to <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> King of <hi>Arragon.</hi> And this is all the Right the <hi>Spaniard</hi> has to that our great Kings Hereditary Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1561. on <hi>Friday 12th</hi> of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> Maſter <hi>John Tanquerel,</hi> a Batchelor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, was condemn'd by a Sentence of the Court to make confeſſion publickly, that he had indiſcreetly and raſhly held this Propoſition; <hi>That the Pope is Vicar of Chriſt, having Power ſpiritual and ſecular, and that he may deprive of their Dignities the Princes that rebel againſt his Commands. And notwithſtanding that</hi> Tanquerel <hi>proteſted, that he had propos'd</hi>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:109071:103"/>
                     <hi>this</hi> Doctrin aliter tantum &amp; non juridice; that is to ſay, not for affirming it as true, but as a Subject for diſpute in the Schools, was he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to make this acknowledgment.</p>
                  <p>During the Wars of the League <hi>an.</hi> 1591. were ſent from <hi>Rome</hi> Bulls monitory of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XIV. by the which King <hi>Henry</hi> the Great was declar'd uncapable of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> as an Heretick, and a Relapſer; and his Kingdom was expoſed to prey. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Court of Parliament aſſembled at <hi>Tours,</hi> made this Decree.</p>
                  <p>The Court having regard to the concluſions of the Kings Procurator-General, have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and do declare the Bulls monitory given at <hi>Rome</hi> the firſt of <hi>March</hi> 1591. null, abuſive, damnable, full of impiety, and impoſtures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the holy Decretals, Rights, Franchiſes, and Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi>-Church. Do Order that the Copies ſealed with the Seal of <hi>Marſilius Landrianus,</hi> under-ſeal'd <hi>Septilius Lamprius,</hi> be torn by the Executioner of High-Juſtice, and burnt in a Fire which ſhall be kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled for this occaſion, before the great Gate of the Palace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was executed <hi>Auguſt 5th</hi> of the ſame year.</p>
                  <p>I verily believe that many good <hi>Freuch</hi> men read not theſe Examples with pleaſure, and reckon it no glory that the Pope has never ſet his foot on the neck of a King of <hi>France,</hi> as Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third did to the Emperor <hi>Frederick,</hi> nor kick'd off his Crown with his foot, as <hi>Celeſtine</hi> II. to the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> VI. nor brought our Kings to yield homage to the Pope for their Kingdom, as other Kings have
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:109071:103"/>
done, and do to this day. Without doubt they will laugh at the juſt puniſhment which <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. had for his Inſolence from the Officers of the generous King <hi>Philip the Fair,</hi> and to ſee how after this treatment the Popes Succeſſors of <hi>Boniface,</hi> did compliment him with a many Commendations, and Apoſtolick Benedictions.</p>
                  <p>Without doubt alſo theſe good <hi>French</hi>-men are well ſatisfied with the pragmatick Sanctions whereby our Kings have repreſs'd the Exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and have appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Collation of a number of Benefices; and think we are well helpt up in that the King, the Magiſtrates, and the Sorbonne will own no other Superior to the King but God, for what concerns Temporals.</p>
                  <p>But I pray to what end is all this briskneſs in our Kings, in our Parliaments, and in the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon againſt the Uſurpations of the Pope in Temporals, but to yield him the Spirituals, and to confirm his pretenſions even in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals? Grant him the Spiritual Power, and he will be Maſter of the Temporal without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and he ſhall bring under his Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction all ſecular Cauſes under the colour of a Sacrament, of an Oath, of Charitable Uſes, or of matters of Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>The Concords of our Kings with <hi>Rome,</hi> and their pragmatick Sanctions about the Collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Benefices, what have they come to? Is not this to come in for a ſhare with the Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who had ſeiz'd the Royalties, and by ſolemn Articles to make them a Title, which they had no pretence to before their Invaſions? And what other do our Kings, in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:109071:104"/>
the Spiritual Power of the Pope, but own themſelves his Subjects in Temporals? for the one hooks in the other of neceſſity. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of ſix ages has prov'd this truth. 'Tis the voluntary Subjection of Emperors and Kings to the Spiritual Power of the Pope, that has given him the liberty to Excommunicate them, for this belongs to the Spiritual Juriſdiction. And the very ſame Juriſdiction has authoris'd him to exempt their Subjects from the Oath of Fidelity, for the keeping of an Oath is a duty of Religion: ſo that if the Pope be obey'd by a diſcontented and factious People, you ſee an Emperor or King is depos'd by the Spiritual Juriſdiction: and the Pope may ſpare the other Power that he pretends to over the Temporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Kings, ſeeing that his Spiritual power all alone is ſufficient to ruine the poor Prince.</p>
                  <p>And if that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, that are of his Communion, own him for the Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt; let the Kings underſtand it in what ſenſe they pleaſe, he will make them know, when-ever their weakneſs ſhall give him an opportunity, that he takes himſelf for the Vicar of the Secular Power of Jeſus Chriſt, as well as of the Spiritual: And that to him, as to Chriſt whom he repreſents, all Power is given in Heaven and on Earth. This is what the laſt Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> attributes to him, and applies to him that Propheſie of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 72. particular to Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>All Kings ſhall be proſtrate before him, and all Nations ſhall ſerve him</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Kings that proſtrate themſelves the moſt humbly before him, are thoſe he throws
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:109071:104"/>
at his Feet. Witneſs the Treatment he gave our good King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, who Ador'd him: and yet he Thundered upon him, and perſecuted him even to death, and beyond death. For after he was Aſſaſſinated, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of his Excommunication and Depoſition, by his Creatures of the League, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe</hi> that he favour'd: He would not at all ſuffer any Obits or Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be made for him at <hi>Rome,</hi> as if he had a mind to have him Damn'd, after he had caus'd him to be Murder'd. Particularly he extoll'd, in a Publick Harangue, the execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Parricide <hi>Jacob Clement,</hi> and compares his Fact to the Myſtery of the Incarnation of the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>The deſign of this perſecution drawn out ſo at length againſt the King, the Princes of the Blood, and againſt all the Kingdom, is to be ſeen in the Memoirs of the Advocate <hi>David,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted at <hi>Lions, An.</hi> 1577. as he was upon his return from <hi>Rome,</hi> where he had been Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to the Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> the King's Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador with the Pope. This Biſhop of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> a Creature of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> being at <hi>Rome, An.</hi> 1576. inſtead of ſerving the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the King his Maſter, who had ſent him to make an excuſe, by reaſon of the neceſſity of the King's Affairs, for the Peace he had made with the Duke <hi>Alenzon</hi> his Brother, and with the Princes of the Blood that were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; He apply'd himſelf wholly to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and the Pope, who had then complotted together their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh deſign of the League. For the Pope,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:109071:105"/>
whoſe cuſtom it is to build his Greatneſs upon the weakneſs of Kings, and the troubles of their States, ſeeing the Royal-Houſe declining, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd, and drawing to an end, and <hi>France</hi> haraſſed with Civil Wars; was eaſily wrought upon to favour the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd manifeſtly to the Crown by the excluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Princes of the Blood. So upon the whole matter, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> a Prince well made, and of high undertaking, powerful in Friends, lov'd and ador'd by the People, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give him all the Soveraignty in <hi>France,</hi> which he counts himſelf debarr'd of, by the pragmatick Sanctions, and by the Liberties of the <hi>Gallicane</hi>-Church.</p>
                  <p>Then during the ſtay of this Ambaſſador at <hi>Rome, An.</hi> 1576. an Agreement was drawn between the Pope and Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Pope Declares, That <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> had ſeiz'd the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> which of Right belong'd to the Houſe of <hi>Charlemaign.</hi> That he and his Race had render'd the <hi>French</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory and diſobedient to the Holy See, by that damnable Error which they call the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the <hi>Gallicane</hi>-Church, which is none other, (ſays he) but the Doctrine of the <hi>Valdenſes, Albigenſes,</hi> the Poor of <hi>Lyons, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts.</hi> That it is this Error which makes the Arms of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> in defence of the Holy Church, unfortunate, and that they never will proſper, ſo long as the Crown ſhall continue in this Line.</p>
                  <p>In order thereunto, an opportunity was now offer'd by reaſon of the preſent Diviſions, to labour in good earneſt the Reſtoration of the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:109071:105"/>
Crown to the true Succeſſors of <hi>Charlemaign</hi> who had always conſtantly obey'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Holy See. And who had in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſhew'd themſelves the lawful Heirs of the Apoſtolick Benediction upon that Crown, though depriv'd of their Inheritance by fraud and violence.</p>
                  <p>That 'tis plain, the Race of the <hi>Capets</hi> are wholly deliver'd over to a reprobate Senſe; ſome being poſſeſs'd with a ſpirit of Mopiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Stupid, and of no Valour. Others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by God and Men for their Hereſie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and ſhut out from the Communion of the Holy Church. Whereas the Branches of <hi>Charlemaign</hi> are freſh and flouriſhing, Lovers of Virtue, vigorous of Body and in Mind, for the execution of high and laudable Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes. He goes on and Propheſies for them, that as War bad been the means whereby they loſt their Degree, ſo Peace ſhall do them the ſervice to reſtore them to their ancient Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Kingdom, with the good Will, the Conſent and the Choice of all the People.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards follows a Leſſon of the Conclave, for the execution of this Deſign, well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be read. For it is the whole plot and project of the League, which was exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd all along, even to the very laſt Act with the States of <hi>Blois,</hi> when the Theatre on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain fell upon the Actors Heads, and that the Tragical death of two of the Principals broke the great deſign ready to be accompliſht; which was to ſhut the King in a Monaſtery, and the Queen in another, and to put to death all the Princes of the Blood, to make way for Monſieur
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:109071:106"/>
the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> to whom immediately the Crown was to be given.</p>
                  <p>For the Concluſion of this Accord, his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs requires of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> that he ſhall cauſe to be acknowledg'd the power of the Holy See, by the States of the Realm, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſtriction or modification:</hi> aboliſhing the Priviledges and the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi>-Church, the which he ſhall promiſe and ſwear to do before he take the Crown.</p>
                  <p>The Pope enrag'd to ſee his great deſign quaſh'd, that he had laboured and puſh'd on with ſo much Artifice, by the execution made by the King upon the perſons of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and of the Cardinal his Brother, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates and Depoſes the King, who, for all that, loſt not his Crown, till he loſt his Life; alſo, being aſſaſſinated by <hi>James Clement,</hi> a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minican-Monk: who being immediately kill'd by the King's Servants there preſent, had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly been Canoniz'd by his Holineſs for his Heroick Act, if the buſineſs of the League had proſper'd: for we have have ſeen and read with horror the <hi>Legend</hi> of St. <hi>James Clement,</hi> Printed and Diſperſed through <hi>France:</hi> and his execrable Paracide has been defended as a juſt and meritorious Action by the Jeſuit <hi>Guignard,</hi> who has written a Book expreſly on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Even <hi>Bellarmine</hi> condemns highly thoſe that kill'd the Monk who murdered his King, becauſe, (ſays he) they kill'd <hi>Sacratum virum,</hi> a Man conſecrated, accounting this deteſtable Monk more Sacred and more inviolable, than the Sacred Majeſty of the King,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:109071:106"/>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> the Great having inherited the Crown of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, the Pope proſecutes the League againſt him with a re-doubled Zeal. So that beſides the open War, there followed three ſeveral attempts upon his Perſon, by Villains inſtructed, and poſted in convenient places for their deſign by the Jeſuits, who for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, were baniſh'd out of <hi>France,</hi> and a Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid was erected cloſe by the Palace, with an Inſcription which declar'd the cauſe of their baniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Now, for all that His Majeſty profeſſed the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, yet would not the Pope of a long time receive him into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of the Church, becauſe as yet his Party was but weak. But when his Holineſs ſaw that the Intereſts of the League declin'd, and that good Cities and whole Provinces treated with the King, then the Holy Spirit ſuggeſted to him, that he might receive into his fold of the Church this ſtraying Sheep; out of fear, leaſt <hi>France,</hi> provoked too far, ſhould, in the end, come to do what has been often threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that is, to make a Patriarch of the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licane</hi>-Church.</p>
                  <p>And yet in this Reconciliation, the Pope made appear ſo much Pride and Rancor, this great King could not but in the Perſon of his Ambaſſador, lying on the Ground at the Pope's Feet, receive a bitter Cup of Repentance.</p>
                  <p>Never had a King of <hi>France</hi> made the Pope the like ſubmiſſion. The Pope has taught our Kings a Leſſon to take advantage in their turn of his Neceſſities, to make him bend or break. And I am full of hope that our Great and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:109071:107"/>
King will have a deep reſentment of ſo great an Indignity done to His Heroick Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father. Eſpecially might His Majeſty be pleas'd to conſider, that the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that Reconciliation, never pardon'd him; keeping near his Perſons Confeſſors that conſpir'd againſt his Life, cauſing Seditious Sermons to be Preacht in <hi>Paris,</hi> and cenſuring at <hi>Rome</hi> in full Conſiſtory the Sentence of the Court of Parliament againſt <hi>John Caſtel,</hi> executed for having ſtruck with a knife at this Great King, in order to cut his Throat. And this cenſure was made at <hi>Rome</hi> four Months before that this excellent King was kill'd, to prepare their Spirits for this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable Aſſaſſination.</p>
                  <p>Thereupon, when <hi>Ravaillac,</hi> who perform'd what the other Martyrs of the Pope had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, was examin'd, and asked why he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook this deteſtable Parricide, he anſwered, <hi>That there needed no more than to have heard the Sermons preached in</hi> Paris <hi>the laſt</hi> Lent, <hi>to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any body of the Motives; for the reſt that the King was preparing to make War againſt God, in that he would make War againſt the Pope, and that the Pope is God.</hi> In ſhort, one might find in this Wretch the ſparks of that fiery Zeal, and blind Devotion for His Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the deſperate Spirit of the League, which the Pope, by the means of the Jeſuits, induſtriouſly fomented in <hi>France,</hi> to produce this horrible and dire Effect.</p>
                  <p>When it was repreſented to theſe Bigot Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricides, that the King having been Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, was afterwards Abſolv'd and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:109071:107"/>
to the Pope; they anſwer'd, That his Converſion was feign'd. And they who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted againſt his Perſon, before this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, might ſhield themſelves with the Canon <hi>Excommunicatorum</hi> of Pope <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> which ſpeaks thus, <hi>We count them not Murderers, who ſhall happen to kill any Excommunicated Perſons, out of an Ardour of Zeal, for the Catholick Church their Mother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve then, that all they whom the Pope taxes for Hereſie, they that Appeal from the Pope to a future Council, and they that levy Taxes upon the Clergy, are Excommunicated by the Bull <hi>De coena Domini,</hi> which the Pope pronounces every Thurſday abſolutely: a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Kings and Princes are involv'd in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and the Kings of <hi>France</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt: no Hereſie being more Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal at <hi>Rome,</hi> than the aſſerting of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the <hi>Gallicane</hi>-Church, and the not owning the Terreſtrial Empire of his Holineſs. It concerns then thoſe to make good proviſion for the ſecuring of their Lives, who are by this Canon expos'd to all thoſe who ſhall be puſht on to kill them by an ardor of zeal for the Catholick Church.</p>
                  <p>He was much deceiv'd, who thought that the Pope, and the Jeſuits, his Emiſſaries, take it very ill any ſhould repreſent to the World, that by the Doctrine, and by the Cenſures of <hi>Rome,</hi> Subjects are inſtructed to kill their Kings, as often and as many as it ſhall pleaſe the Pope to Excommunicate; and that the Murder of our two laſt <hi>Henries</hi> enſued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. I think the quite contrary, they are
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:109071:108"/>
well content that in laying to their charge theſe furious Executions, which have plung'd our <hi>France</hi> in a gulph of Miſeries, we ſerve their deſign, which is to ſcare our Kings and Princes, and render them tame Slaves to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the fear of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Depoſition, Rebellion, Knife and Poiſon.</p>
                  <p>But this is not to be fear'd ſave where the People are bigotted with a ſottiſh Zeal, and believe in the Pope, inſtead of believing in God, and obeying the King. <hi>France</hi> at this time is pretty well purg'd of this Zeal. And by the Grace of God, and the wiſe Conduct of His Majeſty, there is no longer now any am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Prince within the Kingdom to rob him of his Peoples Affection, or that may dare to make any Alliance with the Pope, to tumble him from his Throne, and ſhare the Crown.</p>
                  <p>We have this good fortune, that we may ſet out to the life the ill aſpect of <hi>Rome</hi> upon our Kings, and that dangerous vigilance over <hi>France,</hi> without any danger of abating the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of our Great King; but on the contrary, were his truly Royal Courage capable of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, it would yet ſwell the higher, from the conſideration of the Evils that <hi>Rome</hi> has done, and will yet do to <hi>France,</hi> if he do not hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſe the Uſurpations ſhe exerciſes, with impunity in all the parts of his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The honeſt <hi>French men</hi> that have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be near his Perſon, might repreſent to Him the danger of this Doctrine maintain'd by the Popelings of His Kingdom, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt committed to</hi> St. Peter, <hi>as well the earthly as the heavenly Empire,</hi> which are the very
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:109071:108"/>
words of Pope <hi>Nicolas.</hi> Therefore Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine, Ch.</hi> 27. againſt <hi>Barclay,</hi> holds ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, That the Pope may diſpoſe of all the Temporals of the World. <hi>I affirm</hi> (ſays he) <hi>with confidence, That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the time he was Mortal, might diſpoſe of all Temporal things, and deprive the Kings and the Princes of their Kingdoms and Dominions, and that without doubt he has left the ſame Power to his Vicar, to be employ'd, when he ſhall judge it neceſſary for the good of Souls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V. diſplays this Power with great Oſtentation, in his Bull againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> wherein after that he calls Himſelf <hi>Servant of Servants,</hi> he declares, That <q>God has eſtabliſht the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> Prince over all Nations and Kingdoms, to take, deſtroy, diſperſe, conſume, plant and build,</q> and in the Power hereof he does Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themize, degrade, and depoſe this Queen, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves all her Subjects from the Oath of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that they had made her, and forbids them abſolutely to give her Obedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> XIV. ſet out ſuch another Bull againſt our Great <hi>Henry,</hi> declaring him uncapable of the Crown, and expoſing His Kingdom to prey. But both this and the other Bull were torn and caſt into the fire by the hands of the Hangman.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve that the Pope exerciſeth this Power over the Temporalties of Kings <hi>for the good of Souls,</hi> and as <hi>a Spiritual Prince.</hi> So that our <hi>French</hi> Stateſmen may ceaſe to have their Eyes wilfully ſeal'd up by that diſtinction of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual power, which they allow him, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral power that they deny him. For that it
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:109071:109"/>
is by virtue of the Spiritual Power, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth the Temporal. See what Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſays, <hi>De pont. Rom. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <q>The Pope may change the Kingdoms, take them from one, and give them to another, as a Sovereign Spiritual Prince, when it ſhall be neceſſary for the good of Souls.</q> And of this neceſſity he ſhall be the only Judge, as the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Spiritual Prince. For 'tis thus the Cardinal argues, <hi>Apol. pro Garnet p.</hi> 84. <q>If the Church (that is to ſay the Pope) had not the power to diſpoſe of Temporal things, ſhe would not be perfect, and would want the Power that is neceſſary for the attaining her end: for (ſays he) the wicked might enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Hereticks, and go ſcot-free, and ſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, be turn'd upſide down.</q> This reaſon charges imperfection on the Church in the Apoſtles time, for that had no power over the Temporals.</p>
                  <p>Theſe horrible Principles ſo ſtrongly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> were of freſh memory found ſo prejudicial, both to the ſafety of our Kings, and to the Peace of <hi>France,</hi> that thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the third State <hi>an.</hi> 1615. were mov'd to propoſe to the General States an Article, containing the means to diſpoſſeſs, the people of that Opinion, that the King might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by the Pope, and that by the killing of Kings one might gain the Crown of Martyrdom.</p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Du Perron,</hi> in the name of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> oppos'd this Article, and employ'd all the ſtrength of his Eloquence and Learning in two fair Speeches, the one before the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, the other before the third State, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:109071:109"/>
them that our Kings may be depos'd by the Pope, offering himſelf to ſuffer Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in defence of this Truth. The Lords of the Nobility, to their great ſhame, joyn'd with the <hi>Clergy,</hi> for the putting their Kings Crown under the Miter of the Pope, much degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the vertue of their Anceſtors, thoſe <hi>French</hi> Banons, by whoſe advice <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> declar'd to the Cardinal <hi>D'Anagnia,</hi> the Popes <hi>Legat,</hi> that threatned him, that it did not at all belong to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Sentence againſt the King of <hi>France.</hi> But the third State held firm to their Article that maintain'd the Dignity of their King, and the ſafety of his Perſon; and could never be won by promiſes, nor affrighted by threatnings to depart from it, ſhewing themſelves in this more noble than the Nobility.</p>
                  <p>It is no wonder in this caſe that the third State ſhew'd more affection to their King than the Clergy, ſeeing that the Clerks hold, That they are not the King's Subjects; for in effect they acknowledge another Sovereign out of the Kingdom. And who can think it ſtrange if they labour to heighten that Monarchy of which they make a Party? But that the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, the Kings right arm, that they ſhould be ſo baſe to ſtrike their Head, and lay it at the feet of an <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhop; this is that which after Ages will reflect upon with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and indignation, and which Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhall bluſh to relate, and be vex'd that they cannot let paſs in ſilence.</p>
                  <p>So the Nobility being joyn'd with the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, the Article of the third State was cenſur'd
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:109071:110"/>
and rejected. Whereupon the Pope writ Triumphant Letters to the Clergy and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, who had been faithful to Him in this Cauſe, glorying in His Victory, and exalting the Magnanimity of theſe genero<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s Nobles. But in truth, the Deputies of theſe generous Nobles deſerv'd to have been degraded from their Nobility, and they of the third State to have receiv'd their Titles.</p>
                  <p>The minority of the late King, and the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Queen-Mother, render'd them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to theſe Injuries, and apt to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; inſomuch that this Harangue made to the third State was printed, with the Priviledge of the King, and the Pope gain'd his point.</p>
                  <p>The falſe dealing of the Cardinal, who made this Speech, is remarkable; namely, that he had a long time followed King <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, even then when he was of a contrary Religion, and depos'd by the Pope: and that a little before, in an aſſembly held at the <hi>Jacobins</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> he had reſiſted the Popes <hi>Nuncio,</hi> who would that this Doctrine of the Temporal Sovereignty of the Pope might be held for an Article of Faith. But in theſe two Harangues, the Cardinal made a kind of a Recantation, and pronounc'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf his own condemnation. Ungrateful wretch! to have thus abus'd the tender Age of the Son of his King, and his great Benefactor: and to have baſely betray'd the Rights of the King, to oblige the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this may not ſeem ſo ſtrange, if one conſider, that he got the beſt part of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment for certain Services of pleaſure, that do not much bind the Conſcience of him that
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:109071:110"/>
receives them, nor that of him who is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd for them. And in truth, thoſe diverting Services that he and Monſieur <hi>De la Ravenne</hi> render'd to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, deſerve that Poſterity ſhould erect for them Statues crown'd with Myrtle.</p>
                  <p>God be thank'd that <hi>France</hi> now has a King vigorous both in Age and in Virtue, who is the terrour of <hi>Rome,</hi> having ſhewn himſelf ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of its Uſurpations upon <hi>France,</hi> beyond all his Predeceſſors; and of whom we have good occaſion to hope that he will ſhake off this <hi>Italian</hi> Yoke, and baniſh all Foreign Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction out of his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>We alſo ought to bleſs God, for that the <hi>French</hi> Nobility at this day is much of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent temper from that which in the full States ſubmitted the Crown and life of their King to the Popes Tyranny 56 years ago. And that is ready to cover their Fathers faults by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly aſſiſting their King, to make Him the only King within his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>To effect this, above all things, thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Immunities and Exemptions muſt be taken from the Clergy, which indeed are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts from the Kings Authority to that of the Popes. 'Tis in truth very reaſonable, that they who have the charge of Souls, ſhould be diſcharg'd from many publick Services, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they are vow'd and reſerv'd to the Service of God: but however, not that they and their Lands ſhould no longer depend on the King, and be ſubject to another Sovereign.</p>
                  <p>This is what was repreſented to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, by that illuſtrious Perſonage <hi>Achilles</hi>
                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:109071:111"/>
                     <hi>de Harley,</hi> firſt Preſident of his Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament at <hi>Paris,</hi> in a Speech he made to him, to diſſwade him from recalling the Jeſuits, he Remonſtrates to him, That <q>according to their Doctrine, he who has taken the loweſt Orders of the Church, could not be guilty of High Treaſon, whatever Crime he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for that the Clergy are no longer the Kings Subjects, nor belonging to his Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. In ſuch manner that the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (if one would believe them) are exempt from Secular Powers, and may, without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, attempt againſt Kings with their bloody-hands; and that this Doctrine they maintain in their publiſh'd Books, <hi>Thuanus l. 130. ad an.</hi> 1604.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this effect, the Jeſuit <hi>Emanuel Sa</hi> holds, That <hi>the Rebellion of a Clerk againſt the Prince is not the Crime</hi> laeſae Majeſtatis, <hi>becauſe he is not a Subject of the Prince.</hi> Words that have been left out in the Edition of <hi>Paris,</hi> but remain in that of <hi>Cologne,</hi> and that of <hi>Antwerp.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> that has not been purged, ſays the ſame thing. He affirms, <hi>De Cl. C. 28. That a Clerk cannot be puniſhed by the Civil Judges, or in any wiſe brought before the Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Seat of a Secular Magiſtrate.</hi> He likewiſe ſays, That <hi>the Sovereign</hi> Pontifex <hi>having deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the Clerks from the ſubjection of Princes, Kings are no more the ſuperiors of Clerks.</hi> The Pope then by his reckoning is the King of Kings, if he can deliver whom he pleaſes from their ſubjection due to their Princes by their birth, by making them Clerks; and it will be in his Power not to leave in <hi>France</hi> any Subject to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:109071:111"/>
the King, if all his Subjects will but accept of the meaneſt Orders.</p>
                  <p>This Body of the Clergy has its Judges and Officers apart, and Priſons apart. Their Cauſes will not bide the Trial before the Kings Judges, but fly to the <hi>Rota,</hi> or to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory at <hi>Rome.</hi> There may be found an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible number of Perſons in <hi>France,</hi> who, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Title of the Clergy, have ſhaken off the Yoke of the Kings Authority; and a third part of the Land of the Kingdom is in the Church-mens hands, for which they will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther render Homage nor Service to the King. And though the lots and vents, the quints, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quints, and other Rights of Lordſhip belong to the King; all theſe Rights are loſt after that the moveable goods are enter'd into the poſſeſſion of the Clergy. The King alſo loſes his Rights <hi>D'Aubanir,</hi> of Confiſcation, and of Deforence, the Clergy being a Body that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dies, yet mortifies the Inheritances; new Donations falling to them every day, but none goes from them. A famous Writer ſaid plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, That as the Arms and Thighs dwindle when the Belly ſwels to exceſs; ſo in the Body of a State the Nobility and People that are as the Arms and Legs of a Commonweal, are impair'd by the fatning of the Clergy.</p>
                  <p>I am of thoſe who wiſh the Clergy may have thoſe means, and that Dignity which may lift them above Contempt and Oppreſſion, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them reſpected even of Kings. But becauſe I love them, I wiſh their Riches may not be ſo exceſſive, as to create in Kings a jealouſie, that may cauſe them to be taken away, as has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:109071:112"/>
in <hi>England,</hi> and in other places.</p>
                  <p>'Tis therefore a great imprudence of our Lords, the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> who poſſeſs the beſt part, and the fat of the Kingdom, enough to cauſe jealouſie in the Seculars, and the ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of Sacriledge; to add, yet this unjuſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of immunity from all Charges, both for their perſons and for their goods; and defend themſelves with the Popes Authority, which exempts them. Which, in effect, is to tell the King, That they are another Kings Subjects, who has Power to Command Him, to diſpoſe of the Lands, under his Obedience, and to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his Authority over the Perſons of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If for this they alledge a long Cuſtom, we may ſay, That the Popes to ſettle their Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations in <hi>France,</hi> have ever embroil'd our Kings in Troubles, and oblig'd them to think of ſomewhat elſe, beſides the repelling the blind encroachments of a ſtranger Kingdom that crept into their Realm; and that they had to do with weak Princes, or ſuch as had their hands full other ways. But now that God has given <hi>France</hi> a King, wiſe, powerful, flouriſhing, and who has leiſure to have an Eye or all his Intereſts, will theſe Gentlemen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that he will ſuffer long that a third of his Kingdom lie unprofitable to him, and even that it be reſerv'd to fortifie a Foreign Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy? and though natural reaſon requires that they who live at eaſe ſhould comfort thoſe who fight for their preſervation; all this while that the Nobles and the third State op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the invaſion of Strangers, all this while
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:109071:112"/>
that the King is fortifying his Frontiers, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Gariſons, ſetling Officers both for the State and for the War, Why do not the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who are thereby maintain'd in the quiet enjoyment of ſo great plenty, contribute one Mite towards the defraying of publick Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? Why ſhall their increaſe be a diminution to the ſtrength of the King, who is kept wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for their repoſe and preſervation?</p>
                  <p>Shall not the King who is ſo clear-ſighted, ſee what an impoveriſhment it is to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that <hi>France</hi> be tributary to a Stranger, under the Title of Annates, Offerings, Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, Abſolutions, and Cauſes Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial?</p>
                  <p>Againſt theſe Depredations, our ancient Kings had provided ſome remedy by the prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Sanctions, vext to ſee the faireſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the Kingdom paſs over the <hi>Alps</hi> by a Religious ſpoil, and go into the Purſes of thoſe who laugh at our ſimplicity.</p>
                  <p>But what reaſon is there that they who pay ſo willingly Tribute to the Pope, ſhould make ſo great difficulty in paying to the King? Is it not becauſe they believe they owe all to the Pope, and nought to the King? <hi>St. Paul</hi> teaches them to pay Tribute to the Higher Powers, <hi>inaſmuch as they are Miniſtess of God.</hi> And <hi>St. Chryſoſtom</hi> commenting upon this Text, tells them who are <hi>theſe higher Powers. If</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Apoſtle has eſtabliſht this Law whilſt the Princes were</hi> Pagans, <hi>how much more ought this to be done under Princes that are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers?</hi> And he had ſaid before, <hi>The Apoſtle commands this to all, even to the Prieſts,</hi> Which
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:109071:113"/>
is more, he adds, <hi>though thou art an Apoſtle, though thou art an Evangeliſt, or a Prophet, or what ever elſe thou art.</hi> From <hi>St. Ambroſe</hi> we have the ſame Leſſon in his Oration of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Temples, <hi>If Tribute be demanded, refuſe it not, the Lands of the Church pay Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute.</hi> Even Pope <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal ſay, <hi>That the Church pays Tribute of its exterior Goods.</hi> Alſo, <hi>That Tribute muſt be paid to the Emperors, in acknowledgment of the Peace and Repoſe, in which they ought to maintain and defend us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The right of Kings and Truth muſt needs be very ſtrong, that could draw from the Pope and his Canoniſtical Doctors this acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For the Canon Law was not founded for any other end, but to ſupplant the Civil Laws, and eſtablish the Popes Juriſdiction throughout. This is a Body of Foreign Laws, that have their Tribunal apart, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on a Foreign Prince, and where the King has nothing to do but look on; I mean till ſuch time as he ſhall pleaſe to take cognizance of ſo unreaſonable an Uſurpation. And forbid that any Cauſe be judged in <hi>France</hi> by other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than His, and much leſs any Cauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd in <hi>France,</hi> be appeal'd to <hi>Rome.</hi> And, in truth, he is but a King by halfs, till he alone poſſeſs all the Juriſdiction exercis'd within his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>This is what <hi>Charles du Moulin</hi> ſaid in an Epiſtle to <hi>Henry</hi> II. where he writes freely againſt the Empire that the Pope has ſet up within our <hi>France,</hi> where the Pope has Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that ſubmit not to the Laws of the King,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:109071:113"/>
but to thoſe of the Pope, which are the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-Law, and the Conſtitutions that come from <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But (ſome may object) Would you have the King judge in Spirituals? I Anſwer, That if the King ought not to be Judge, it does not follow that the Pope muſt. The King has his Biſhops that may and ought to judge of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters purely Spiritual; but of nought without being authoriz'd by the King: and there is no need of an Authority out of the Kingdom for this.</p>
                  <p>I will ſay more, That the Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is a part of the Office of a King. For ſo it was in the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And who would believe that in this Age, and in <hi>Spain,</hi> where the Inquiſition Reigns, King <hi>Philip</hi> IV. aſſum'd to himſelf the Soveraign Power of Churches within his Dominions? For this purpoſe he apply'd that excellent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Iſodore,</hi> which is attributed alſo to the Council of <hi>Paris, That the Secular Princes ſhould know, that they ought to give an account of the charge of the Church committed to them by Jeſus Chriſt; for whether that the Peace or the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline receive improvement by believing Princes, or that they are impair'd: He who committed the Church to their Power, will demand an account.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O the excellent paſſage! O the Holy Leſſon! God give all Chriſtian Kings the Grace ſo well to learn it, that they may never leave this Charge of the Church which Jeſus Chriſt has committed to them upon the hands of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and when they have taken it into their own hands, to acquit themſelves worthily, and render a good account.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:109071:114"/>Alas! Alas! Have Kings Eyes to ſee their Rights, and have they no hands to maintain them? Are they quick-ſighted enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the Government of the Church is committed to them, and that they are to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an account to God; and have they not the courage to reſcue them from unjuſt and ſtrange Hands that ſnatch them away? Think they to acquit themſelves of this great Account, of the Government of the Church of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, by ſaying, That the Holy Father has diſcharg'd them of it, when they have in their hands the power to diſcharge Him from his Uſurpations?</p>
                  <p>In Truth, they will never be in condition to Govern the Church committed to them; they will never be but Kings by halfs, till they have baniſht from their Territories this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Spiritual Juriſdiction, which deſtroys the Civil, and which will draw under its Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance all ſorts of Cauſes, there being none, wherein there is not ſome matter of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or ſome kind of Tranſgreſſion of Gods Commandments, and that by conſequence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to the Juriſdiction of the Pope, if He muſt be own'd the Soveraign Spiritual Judge in <hi>France.</hi>

                  <p>The Popes themſelves inform our Kings of their Right to Govern the Church. <hi>Leo</hi> IV. writing to <hi>Lewis</hi> and to <hi>Lotharius,</hi> did not he own that the Inveſtiture of the Biſhop comes from the Emperor, and the Pope has only the Conſecration? Did not He beſeech the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to inveſt a perſon he had recommended? and does he not acknowledge, that the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:109071:114"/>
dares not Conſecrate him, without the Emperors conſent? And Pope <hi>John</hi> X. in his Epiſtle to <hi>Hereiman</hi> of <hi>Cologue,</hi> about the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of <hi>Heldwin</hi> of <hi>Tongres;</hi> does he not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, <hi>That the old Cuſtom has this force, that none ought to confer a Biſhoprick upon any Clerk, ſave the King, to whom the Scepter has been given of God.</hi>

                  <p>The Council held at <hi>Thionvil,</hi> under <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debonnair, An.</hi> 835. gives us this good Maxim, That the Pope ought to be call'd Pope and Brother, not Father and <hi>Pontifex:</hi> and that <hi>Lewis</hi> had more Power in the Government of the <hi>Gallicane</hi>-Church, than the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Agobard</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lions</hi> has it in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Co<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="4+ letters">

                     <hi>Gregory Turonenſis</hi> does furniſh us with more than Ten Examples of the right of Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture belonging to our Kings before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire fell into their hands. In the times of <hi>Clovis</hi> they held the Royal Right of the Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiture of Biſhops. They had alſo a Right which they call'd Regal, which was the Power of enjoying vacant Biſhopricks and Prebends, and the moveables of Biſhops dying without a Will. And it is very eaſie to prove, that under the firſt Line of our Kings, and a long while under the Second, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> were the Soveraigns as well in Spirituals as in Temporals. And though they had loſt their Soveraignty about the end of the Second Line, and under the Third by their negligence, and by the cunning of the Popes, watchful for their advantage; nevertheleſs an infinite
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:109071:115"/>
of Perſons, in thoſe times, both of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and of the Law, took notice of, and Taxed the Uſurpations of the Popes upon the Rights of our Kings. Amongſt others, <hi>Aegydius Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Bourges,</hi> in the time of <hi>Philip the Fair,</hi> this Archbiſhop, for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Regiſtred in the Court of Parliament, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates, That the <hi>Gallicane</hi>-Church has that Right, and that Liberty to provide for its oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions by Synods of the Biſhops of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, without that the Pope ought to meddle, unleſs by way of exhortation.</p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>D'Offat</hi> (Letter 90 to the King) ſhews, That the Pope ought not to meddle at all with the Election of t<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The excellent Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris, Peter de Marca,</hi> in his agreement of Empire and the Prieſthood, has wiſely and boldly Remonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; That ſince the Pope would hold the ſame Degree in <hi>France,</hi> that the Soveraign Sacrificer held in the Synagogue, he ought not to pretend to more Authority in our <hi>France,</hi> than the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Sacrificer had in the Kingdom of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> where he was the Kings Subject: his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, his Juriſdiction, the Affairs of the Church, the Order of Ceremonies were within the Kings Juriſdiction: who depos'd the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificer, and ſet another in his place, out of his pure and full Authority. God be prais'd for that in theſe later times, where the Throne
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:109071:115"/>
of iniquity, the Papal See is ſo much adored, he has rais'd up ſuch brave Aſſertors of our Chriſtian Liberty, which would bear up again, and for which we want only to ſhake off the Yoak.</p>
                  <p>What is alledg'd the moſt ſpecious for the neceſſity of a Pope to ſuperintend the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Kingdom, is, that the Kings need an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter of their Differences, that may be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reſpected, and whoſe Dignity and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may oblige them to Submiſſion and Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>But if this general Arbiter, inſtead of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Peace amongſt Princes, foment their Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and embroil their Affairs, to fiſh in troubl'd Waters, they ſhall do wiſely to let him alone, and yet more wiſely to rid themſelves of him.</p>
                  <p>There's no queſtion but that when a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Peace is for the advantage of the Pope, that then he will ſet himſelf ſeriouſly about it. But it rarely happens otherwiſe, then that the good of one party ſhall be diſadvantageous to the Pope, and then 'tis ill truſting to his Arbitrement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>France</hi> has more reaſon to ſtand upon its guard than any other Nation, for the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> has always ſought its ruin: has fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd its Enemies, or rais'd them up anew. When the <hi>Engliſh</hi> made War againſt us, <hi>Rome</hi> abetted their quarrel, and aided them with Spiritual Weapons. I cannot let paſs the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous aſſiſtance ſent to <hi>Henry</hi> V. of <hi>England,</hi> when he levied an Army to go into <hi>France:</hi> this was a Ship loaden with Conſecrated Apples,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:109071:116"/>
which were diſtributed to all who would Liſt themſelves for this War: and they liſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a good Will, having ſcrambl'd for the Apples with Greedineſs and Devotion, and were well ſatisfied in Conſcience of the Juſtice of this Expedition by theſe Apples Apoſtolical.</p>
                  <p>The Pope employ'd more powerful means againſt us, when <hi>France</hi> was weak, and the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> powerful, whom he aſſiſted with all his Forces Spiritual and Temporal. What a ſtrong League did he make to deſtroy both King and Kingdom? What Evils did he heap on <hi>France?</hi> and after the injury done us, how much praying did he require before he would be appeas'd?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomas Campanella</hi> ſpeaks thus of this Judge of differences, <hi>Who ſhall carefully read Hiſtory, ſhall find that the Popes have made more Wars amongſt Chriſtians, than they have quieted.</hi> Let <hi>France</hi> mark what he adds, <hi>So far have the Popes been from oppoſing himſelf,</hi> Hiſpanis Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorum helluonibus, <hi>to the</hi> Spainiards <hi>unſatiable devourers of Empire, that the Pontifical Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has lent pretences to their Voracity: Witneſs</hi> Navarre <hi>and</hi> France <hi>in the times of</hi> Henry III.</p>
                  <p>For this laſt hundred years, all the Popes (except <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the VIII.) have favour'd the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> And what reaſon can we have to expect better from them, ſeeing that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Cardinals are born Subjects to <hi>Spain,</hi> in the Principalities of <hi>Milan,</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and of <hi>Sicily;</hi> and that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> is inclos'd within theſe Principalities? Judge what confidence we can have in ſuch Arbiters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:109071:116"/>
                     <hi>France</hi> loſes plainly both Money and Pains' ſending Ambaſſadors to theſe Gentlemen, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, and enriching them, when they are aſſembled for the Election of a Pope. The fear they have of <hi>France</hi>'s Power, may gain ſome reſpect, but it is a reſpect without Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and when <hi>France</hi> has gain'd it, I do not ſee what <hi>France</hi> has gain'd.</p>
                  <p>They have reaſon to fear the King, knowing that this Great Prince is ſenſible of their Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations; and they have no great reaſon to love his Subjects, becauſe they are no great purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of Indulgences. And the leſs the King cares for them, the more will they fawn upon him; but we may aſſure our ſelves, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all their ſtrength, and ſet to work all their Art and Subtilty to put a ſtop to his Progreſs, and to pull down his Greatneſs.</p>
                  <p>That agreement of the Pope with the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> ought never to be forgotten. What rancour did he teſtifie againſt the Royal Line that Reigns at this day? what Pains did he take to diſinherit and deſtroy it? Into what combuſtion did he caſt the poor Kingdom, that he might have a King of his own Choice, who might aboliſh the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi>-Church, and make <hi>France</hi> a Fief of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> Let us for our experience learn the truth of that Character given by <hi>Aeneus Sylvius,</hi> who was afterwards Pope <hi>Pius</hi> II. That there was never any great Slaughter in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> nor any great Calamity happen'd either of Church or State, whereof the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were not the Authors. <hi>Hiſt. Auſtria.</hi> And as much is ſaid by <hi>Machaivel</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:109071:117"/>And if we conſider that the great Evils done by the Pope to Kings, were done under the colour of com-promiſe; we ſhall find that 'tis the ſureſt way to decline his kindeſs, and to have nought to do with him; and that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways comes better off that affronts him, than he that flatters him.</p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs after he has wiſely conſider'd, that the name of Religion is a falſe pretext laid hold on by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> thereby to encreaſe their Temporal Power, and raiſe them Creatures every where, the abuſes he would have retrench'd after the example of <hi>Charlemaign,</hi> and of many more great Kings.</p>
                  <p>But to compaſs this, it is not adviſeable to appear in it barefac'd, for (ſays he) <hi>That would be to bring upon us the Clamours and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of all the Monks and their followers; this would be to bring</hi> Rome <hi>upon our back, which might give us trouble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confeſs that no good can be acquir'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble. But I cannot conceive that it would be much trouble to deliver <hi>France</hi> from the Uſurpations and the Exactions of <hi>Rome.</hi> To forbid that there be in <hi>France</hi> no more Courts depending on the Pope; nor Money carried from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> or any Cauſe removed thither by Appeal. And that no proviſion of Benefices be receiv'd from thence. This, in truth, would be to bring <hi>Rome</hi> on our backs; but not one Sword would be drawn in the Cauſe either within the Kingdom or without. Should the Emperor do the ſame within his Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, our King would not ſtir; nor would the Emperor any more be concern'd if the King
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:109071:117"/>
ſhould ſet back the Juriſdiction of the Pope to beyond the <hi>Alps.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. of <hi>England</hi> did the ſame in his Kingdom, what Prince undertook the quarrel againſt him: How eaſily would the People accuſtom themſelves to be free from the Papal Exactions: and how vain and idle were the Attempts of the Popes Partiſans in <hi>England</hi> to reſtore his Authority? that Prince hack'd and haraſs'd what he had a mind to in the Eccleſiaſtick Eſtate, and the clamours of the Monks, which the Marqueſs is affraid on, frighted not him, though he treated them courſely.</p>
                  <p>Nor are we at all to fear leaſt the Monks take up Arms, as the Chiefs of the League forc'd them to do; which would ſerve only to make them be laught at, and gave a ſubject to the <hi>Painters</hi> for thoſe antick and ridiculous Portracts that they have left us. Or if any little broil ſhould be rais'd by ſome of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, how ſoon muſt it fall before a great King who is never without an Army.</p>
                  <p>Who ſhall read over all the Book of the Marquiſs, ſhall find that he propoſes Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations in the State far more hand to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, than the baniſhing of the Canon-Law and Papal Juriſdiction out of the Kingdom. For he would perfectly melt down the Juſtice and Policy, and caſt them all anew. He has truly made it appear, that he underſtands the Malady of the State, and yet his Projects to remedy them cannot be put in execution, without bringing to ruine and deſpair many active Spirits that live on their Proſeſſions, which is very dangerous to attempt in a State.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:109071:118"/>
Whereas the expulſion of the Canon-Law out of <hi>France,</hi> and the reduction of all Cauſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on depending to the Civil Magiſtrate, and of all perſons acknowledging the Pope to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the King, would not at all be any dangerous Innovation. To diſcontent the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Eccleſiaſticks that are unactive, as bred up in the ſhade, and in contemplation, or in idleneſs, can be no great danger: eſpecially leaving them their Revenues, at leaſt for life.</p>
                  <p>I neither have the wit nor the preſumption to give a model of what Orders ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd the Church after the Papal Juriſdiction is baniſht the Kingdom. And I ſhall go no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to ſay, that I ſee no vigour in the <hi>Roman</hi> Juriſdiction, and their Partiſans in <hi>France,</hi> that may hinder the King from caſhie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them abſolutely, and making himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter at home. Even the Excommunications and Interdicts that would follow, would ſtrengthen him, being of no other effect but to provoke the Parliaments, and to animate the People againſt the Pope. The greateſt part of the Clergy would ſubmit to the King, and would caſt off all Foreign Domination: and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Clergy would be inconſiderable, would be diſperſt, and vaniſh before the Rays of the Authority Royal.</p>
                  <p>And, I pray, a King of <hi>England,</hi> could he accompliſh this Work, to free himſelf from the Papal-Yoke, though carried thereunto more by paſſion than prudence? And our Great King, ſo Vigorous, ſo Powerful, ſo Wiſe, ſhall not he dare to undertake it, for fear of vexing the Pope and the Monks? Shall he be ſcar'd with an imaginary Monarchy, that has
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:109071:118"/>
neither force nor foundation, ſave in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thoſe that fear it, and eſtabliſh it by their ſottiſh fear?</p>
                  <p>What is moſt conſiderable in this Example, is, That the Pope continues baniſht out of <hi>England.</hi> For though reſtor'd by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and his Power own'd for the ſpace of five years; Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the Kings her Succeſſors, found themſelves ſo much at eaſe in being deliver'd from the <hi>Roman</hi>-Yoke, and in being acknowledged Supreme, under God, in all Cauſes, and over all Perſons, as well Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical as Civil; that they have maintain'd, and do yet maintain this Authority eſſential to their Crown.</p>
                  <p>This Authority is no leſs eſſential to the Crown of our Great King; and 'tis this that the good Prince, <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents to all Kings and Princes of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> in the Remonſtrance he has made them, touching the Rights of their Crowns. They have not hitherto been ſo happy to liſten to it, but let us hear what he ſays to them.</p>
                  <q>If you that are the moſt Powerful, come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in earneſt with your ſelves, that well-nigh a third of your People and of your Lands belong to the Church; will not the Thoughts of ſo great a loſs move you, which withdraws from your Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction ſo many Men, and ſo much of your Lands in ſuch manner, that every where they plant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies and Provinces for the Pope? What Thorns and Thiſtles ſuffer you to grow in the Country un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Subjection, ſo long as ſo powerful a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction flouriſhes and ſpreads over ſo much good Soil within your Kingdoms, openly maintaining that they are exempt from your Power, and that they
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:109071:119"/>
are by no right ſubject to your Laws, and to your Judgments? inſomuch, that whereas formerly the Clerks deſir'd no more but their Tiths, and liv'd thereon content; at this day the Pope, chief of the Clerks, is not content with leſs than a third part of your Subjects, and of your Lands.</q>
                  <p>Theſe words of a King, our Neighbour, happily enjoying a Sovereignty independant of the Pope, of which his Anceſtor robb'd this Robber an hundred and forty years ago, ought to move in our Kings a virtuous Emulation to recover, and after to maintain the Rights pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to their Crown. And the example of ſo flouriſhing a ſucceſs ought to encourage them to ſo juſt and ſo noble an Undertaking.</p>
                  <p>From this great and principal acquiſition, that the King ſhall be the only Sovereign in his Kingdom, other advantages will ariſe. Theſe ſtranger Courts being put down (that are the Mills whither every one brings, and where the Moulture goes all to <hi>Rome,</hi> or to their Creatures) the Money they drain from the Kings Subjects ſhall ſtay in <hi>France;</hi> and ſeeing that this employs a great number of Officers, that only do harm to the State; when this Gate ſhall be ſhut, the young Men will ſeek out other ways to make themſelves valued by, and the Arts and Commerce of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will be more conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall likewiſe ſave the Treaſure, that is ſpent unprofitably in the Embaſſies to <hi>Rome,</hi> and in courting the good Graces of the Cardinals at the Elections of Popes, and in the Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Legates and Nuncio's; by all which <hi>France</hi> does nought elſe but proſeſs and encreaſe her Slavery, without the return of the leaſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:109071:119"/>
For what-ever Compliments, what-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Expence <hi>France</hi> may make, yet the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King is the Minion of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Spain</hi> are the Chapmen that but moſt of their Wares, and that have moſt blind De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion for the Holy See. And in truth, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Politicks of <hi>France</hi> (by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs) and Monfieur <hi>Silhon,</hi> and before them Cardinal <hi>D'Oſſat,</hi> have teſtified their little ſatisfaction with <hi>Rome,</hi> and publiſh'd her Cheats, in ſo far that as we know that <hi>Rome</hi> does not at all love us; in like manner <hi>Rome</hi> well knows, that we care not for Her: and I cannot underſtand to what end ſerve all our Civilities to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> but to puff them up the more, and provoke the Gentlemen to laughter, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt receive a wonderful pleaſure in ſeeing their profeſſed Enemies come to kiſs their feet.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that ſo long as <hi>France</hi> ſuffers <hi>Rome</hi> to diſpoſe of many Benefices, we muſt always have occaſion to deal with them; and as the Pope, to Preſerve his Credit, amuſes the Princes with com-promiſes and treaties which he draws out at length, deporting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as the Judge of Differences, whereas he creates more than he decides. So very often Princes contribute to his Inclination by their delays, and in ſetting before his Council-board Affairs that they have no intention ſhould be concluded. And whatever their Inclination be at the bottom, he is courted and careſs'd as the Arbiter, which pleaſes him extremely. And why ſhould it not pleaſe him to have at his Court the Ambaſſadors of the Empire, of <hi>France,</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and other Princes that bring him Authority by their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:109071:120"/>
and bring gain to his Court and his Citizens, by their Liberalities, and by their Expences, ſuitable to the Dignity of their Maſters? The great Men and the Sages of Council to His Majeſty may, when they pleaſe, conſider what good comes to our Kings, by their keeping the Pope in this humour, of his being their Judge, and in letting him enjoy his pretended Rights in <hi>France.</hi> And whether it is not better, and a ſhorter way, for <hi>France</hi> to do its own buſineſs without him, and to take from him what does not at all belong to him in our Kingdom, that we may have no more to do with him.</p>
                  <p>The King has been pleas'd to declare, That he deſir'd to re-unite his Subjects in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. This ſo Chriſtian and Royal Deſign cannot be executed, ſo long as the Pope ſhall have any Power in <hi>France;</hi> for this Re-union cannot be made, unleſs the Parties mutually yield ſome matters either in the Doctrine or in the Diſcipline; 'tis certain that the Pope will never conſent, at leaſt not to be own'd the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of Jeſus Chriſt, that has all the Power which Jeſus Chriſt had upon Earth; and that on the other hand, the Proteſtants who have quite another Opinion of him, and ſuch an one as all know (though they make it not an Article of their Faith) they can never ſubmit to his Authority. But if that <hi>France</hi> were not govern'd in Spirituals, ſave by the King and his Biſhops, an half of the way to this great Work were already over; it being moſt certain, that moſt of the Points in difference are not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by the Theologians, vow'd to the Popes Service, farther than as they ſerve his Intereſts.</p>

                  <head>REFLECTIONS UPON THE Fifth Chapter OF THE <hi>Politicks of</hi> France, Which Treats of the HUGUENOTS.</head>
                  <p>I Have Treated my Lord, the Marqueſs of <hi>C.</hi> with all the Reſpect that was poſſible for me in my Reflections upon his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Clergy. I could not do more to comply with him and ſerve him, than by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving his Judgment, and confirming it with Authorities, adding only what he durſt not venture, and (may be) had a mind to ſay.</p>
                  <p>Upon his Chapter of the <hi>Huguenots</hi> I ſhall keep my ſelf within the ſame Reſpect. But I would hope from his Ingenuity, that after I have taken ſome pains in commending and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the judgment he has made on the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Clergy, he in recompence would give me the liberty to oppoſe that which he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, upon thoſe he calls <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:109071:121"/>
complain of the Treatment he would have dealt to them.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe I take great delight in according with him as far as is poſſible, I embrace the advice he gives at the entrance, <hi>That a King cannot have a more noble Object of his care, than to preſerve in his States the Religion he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from his Anceſtors.</hi> For though this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition be not univerſally true, I will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it in his Senle, ſuppoſing that he means the True Chriſtian Religion. And 'tis that His Majeſty <hi>he receiv'd of His Anceſtors;</hi> the which I preſume he will not limit to two or three Deſcents of his next Predeceſſors; but as he has drawn from three Stocks the lawful Succeſſion of our laſt Kings, and affirms, That they are <hi>Branches ſprung from the ſame root,</hi> he cannot take it ill that we go back to the Firſt and Second Race, to find the Religion that His Majeſty has receiv'd of his Anceſtors. Therefore as the Noble Marqueſs in his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter, ſpeaking of the pretended Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions of the Clergy, appeals for that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the old Kings and Emperors, who own'd no ſuch thing, and ſays, <hi>That the Clergy cannot take it amiſs if His Majeſty reduce things to their Primitive ſtate.</hi> In like manner the Marqueſs cannot take it amiſs, that Religion be reduc'd to its Primitive ſtate, at leaſt to the ſtate it was left in at the time when our Kings were Emperors. Now I have ſhew'd in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapter, that the Emperor <hi>Charlemaign,</hi> one of His Majeſties Anceſtors, <hi>Convok'd</hi> a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, in which the Worſhip of Images was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and that he himſelf made a Book
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:109071:121"/>
againſt the Second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and againſt Images, which we have preſerv'd to this day; and that under <hi>Lewis the Mild,</hi> his Son, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Synod was held at <hi>Paris</hi> againſt Images, all the Acts of which we have entire. This Doctrine is a principal Point of the Religion that our Kings receiv'd from their Anceſtors, and which we profeſs. And as much may be ſaid in point of the Holy Sacrament, of which ſo much noiſe is made at this day, that we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly refer our ſelves to what was believ'd in the times of His Majeſties Anceſtors.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould ſtray from my Subject, ſhould I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon Controverſie; the Marqueſs obliges me to ſtand upon another Guard, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Eloquence in treating us as Rebels and Enemies of the State.</p>
                  <p>I am far from juſtifying the evil Actions of our Party. But ſince we are to deal with Men of ſuch a ſpirit, that diſplay the Evil and ſuppreſs the Good, that inſult over us for Actions forc'd by the deſpair of a few, and proteſted againſt by the greater Party; and that will not acknowledge the ſignal Services we have done for the Crown, which ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have been forgotten, ſo long as the Race of <hi>Henry the Great</hi> ſhall Sit upon the Throne. I think my ſelf oblig'd to repreſent truly what is moſt conſiderable in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and in their actions ſince the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Purity of the Goſpel into <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay the laſt return, becauſe that it has been, and has flouriſht there two or three hundred years before, and the Profeſſors, remain'd there skulking, and yet in great numbers, after long
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:109071:122"/>
and cruel Perſecutions. For we diſſemble not, but own that this Holy Doctrine came to us, and was planted by the remains of thoſe poor <hi>Valdenſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> the deſtruction of whom is rank'd by the noble Marqueſs, amongſt the good Works of the firſt Rates. The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter that <hi>Reinerius,</hi> their cruel Inquiſitor, gave them, is very remarkable, and may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie thoſe who ask, where was our Religion before <hi>Luther,</hi> c. 4. <hi>Contra Valdenſes. This,</hi> ſays he, <hi>of all Sects, is the moſt pernicious, for three Reaſons. Firſt, becauſe of its long duration, for ſome ſay, that it has continu'd ſince the time of Pope</hi> Sylveſter; <hi>others hold, that it began even in the Apoſtles time. Secondly, becauſe of all Sects, this is the moſt general, there ſcarce being any Country where this Sect has not taken root. In the Third place, by reaſon that all contrary to other Sects that become abominable, by the enormity of their Blaſphemies againſt God, theſe People ſeem very Godly, for they live juſtly before Men have a ſound belief in all things, and of God, and of all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles contain'd in the Apoſtles Creed: only this, They Blaſpheme againſt</hi> Rome. An admirable Teſtimony from the Pen of a Mortal Enemy, that deſerves to be Writ in Letters of Gold. Let us joyn hereunto that of good King <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. the Father of the People; He was much importun'd by thoſe of the Clergy, who pray'd him to root out the Inhabitants of the <hi>Cabrieres,</hi> and of <hi>Merindol</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> that were of this Profeſſion, and ſome remainders of the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes.</hi> But this juſt King, afore he would grant that bloody Requeſt, would ſee their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, which having read, He ſwore
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:109071:122"/>
they were better Chriſtians than he and his People, and preſerv'd them from the rage of their Enemies. But theſe Enemies obtain'd what they deſir'd of King <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, and made an horrible ſlaughter of thoſe poor <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If theſe <hi>Albigenſes</hi> be Hereticks, becauſe they <hi>Blaſpheme againſt Rome,</hi> Is not the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs one, and all the Men of Politicks in <hi>France,</hi> who declaim ſo openly, and ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly againſt the Pope's Uſurpations, that makes of Religion a pretence thereby to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Rights of the King, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Universal Monarch of all the World?</p>
                  <p>Theſe Gentlemen would abate much of the hatred they bear us; would they be pleas'd to conſider that the Pope and <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy hate us, for a Cauſe that is common to us both. For it is not upon the account of any Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies about the Holy Sacrament, the Invocation of Saints, and the Prayers for the Dead; but it is becauſe we oppoſe boldly the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of <hi>Rome;</hi> it is becauſe we <hi>Blaſpheme againſt Rome,</hi> as the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> in <hi>Reinerius</hi>'s days, That we are call'd (as he calls us) <hi>A pernicious Sect.</hi> This is the great Hereſie for which we have been made Objects of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick hatred, and for which the Devotion of the People is made to conſiſt in a bloody Zeal to burn us, and Maſſacre us.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1520. the Light of the Goſpel ſhin'd throughout all the parts of <hi>France.</hi> And the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> Siſter of King <hi>Francis</hi> I. who was enlighten'd therewith, was a great Rampire againſt the fury of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, that labour'd to extinguiſh this Holy Light by
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:109071:123"/>
Perſecution: However, ſhe could not hinder, but that much cruelty was exerciſed. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her deceaſe the Perſecution grew hot again, and continued during the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> I. and <hi>Henry</hi> II. For the ſpace of Forty years, thoſe that were converted, maintain'd their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Profeſſion, by a conſtancy in their Sufferings, in imitation of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the Primitive Church. Notwithſtanding this Vigor, many of the Princes, and of the beſt Families of <hi>France,</hi> as the Princes of the Blood of the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> embrac'd the Reform'd Religion.</p>
                  <p>Under the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> II. the Princes of the Blood, debarr'd of their Rights by thoſe of the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> the Queens Uncles, form'd the deſign at <hi>Ambois,</hi> to baniſh thoſe from the King's Perſon, that held them at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. This attempt failing, was call'd a Crime of High Treaſon, and charg'd on them of the Reform'd Religion, though <hi>Renaudy</hi> the chief of the Plot, was a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, and this Party was compos'd of Noblemen and Gentry of both the Perſwaſions. Whoſo underſtands the Priviledges of the Princes of the Blood in <hi>France,</hi> will never accuſe theſe Undertakers of the Rebellion. <hi>Thuanus</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in their Favour, <hi>Hiſt. l.</hi> 24. That <hi>not one of them was prov'd to have attempted againſt the King, or againſt the Queen, but only againſt Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that Govern'd all at Court in a Tyrannical way:</hi> For then the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was ſtill lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a Stranger in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Francis</hi> II. being dead, his Succeſſor <hi>Charles</hi> IX. being a Minor, the Princes of the Blood had more Right than afore to be admitted to the management of Publick Affairs, at leaſt
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:109071:123"/>
joyntly with the Queen-Mother. But when they ſaw themſelves excluded, and their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in danger, they Levy'd Forces for their Preſervation.</p>
                  <p>When the King came of Age, the Princes ſeeing Him much incens'd againſt them, and that He was of a dangerous and implacable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they retir'd, and ſtood upon their Guard. The ſeveral Affronts they receiv'd, and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Maſſacres, occaſion'd two or three little Wars.</p>
                  <p>To rid himſelf of them all at one blow, the King ſet his Siſter for a bait, to draw in and to deſtroy the whole Party of the Princes, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her in Marriage to the Prince of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who was afterwards our <hi>Henry the Great.</hi> He and his Couſin Germain the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> were impriſon'd, and the Principals of their Party ſlain in their Beds, having Danc'd at a Ball the Evening before. Never were Dancers at ſuch a Wedding.</p>
                  <p>Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XII. had a hand in this execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Action, his Predeceſſor <hi>Pius</hi> V. refuſed to conſent to this Marriage, becauſe (ſaid he) the Prince of <hi>Navarre</hi> is an Heretick. But when the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> told his Succeſſor <hi>Gregory</hi> XII. that this Marriage was a trap to catch the Hereticks, he then diſpatcht the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, and encourag'd the Deſign.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Navarre</hi> having ſav'd himſelf at <hi>Rochel,</hi> was immediately aſſiſted by a great Party that had eſcap'd the Maſſacre, and the War broke out afreſh. Thereupon was form'd that Faction of the League, to deſtroy the Princes of the Blood, under the colour of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and particularly, to deſtroy the King
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:109071:124"/>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> III. as appear'd afterwards. During theſe long Troubles, what refuge found the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> whom God reſerv'd for the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> but amongſt theſe of the Reform'd Religion? Theſe were they that aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that defended, and even nouriſht him in his long and cruel Adverſities.</p>
                  <p>And after, in the end, when the League had pull'd off the Mask, and had driven the King from <hi>Paris,</hi> and beſieg'd him at <hi>Tours,</hi> came not they to his Relief under their brave Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and did they not deliver him from the utmoſt danger, though he had ſent his Armies againſt them, to extirpate them?</p>
                  <p>I would gladly ask the Noble Marqueſs, Where were then the honeſt <hi>French?</hi> and where were the Rebels? Would he find the honeſt <hi>French</hi> amongſt the fiery Zealots and <hi>Bigots</hi> of the League, <hi>Who have ſhed ſo much Blood to beat down this dangerous Sect,</hi> as he is pleas'd to brand us? With your good leave, Noble Marqueſs, which of the two is this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Sect, that which teaches that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Kings are inviolable, and that expoſes their Lives to defend thoſe Kings that had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted them; or that which holds, That a King Excommunicated by the Pope, may be juſtly kill'd by any body; and which out of zeal for Religion, plunge their Bloody Hands into the Bowels of their Soveraign, as St. <hi>Jacob Clement</hi> did, and as <hi>John Caſtrel</hi> and <hi>Peter Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iere</hi> attempted, and as <hi>Ravaillac</hi> perform'd? Where is the <hi>Huguenot</hi> that ever offer'd any thing of this Nature, during all the Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Party? Or where is the Miniſter that ever broacht ſuch Doctrine to his Flock,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:109071:124"/>
to kill their King, which your Spiritual Fathers have ſo often done? I would alſo ask the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, Where he finds <hi>that term of near four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcorce years ſpent in quelling this dengerous Sect,</hi> which is the title he is pleaſed to give us? Would he take in to theſe 80 years, the 38 after the death of <hi>Francis</hi> II. till the Peace of <hi>Amiens,</hi> in which time the Reformed Party were the conſtant, and the only ſupport of the Great <hi>Henry</hi> for near 30 years? Will he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay, That thoſe Arms which defended the hope of after Ages, and the fortune of <hi>France,</hi> were unjuſt?</p>
                  <p>Let him alſo ſay if he pleaſe, Whether by the <hi>zeal that has been to reduce the Hereticks to their duty,</hi> he means that Butchery of the St. <hi>Bartholomews,</hi> and the Maſſacres in every Town of <hi>France,</hi> at that time and before, which are reductions of a ſtrange nature.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe he may Object, That their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Princes of the Blood was only a pretence for the <hi>Huguenots</hi> taking up Arms, and their unjuſt reſiſtance againſt their Sovereign. It will ſuffice to anſwer, That their Arms were neceſſary for the Preſervation of that Great Prince, whom God reſerv'd for the bleſſing of <hi>France;</hi> and that when He came to the Crown, they were judg'd worthy of a Reward. I would beſeech alſo all indifferent perſons to conſider them ſimply as men, that are neither Angels nor Devils, and to tell us, if they think it ſtrange that men, the Relicks of Fires and Slaughters (which were the only arguments employ'd for their Converſion for ſo many years) take the courſe at length that Nature teaches them, to defend themſelves againſt force with
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:109071:125"/>
force. This to take it at the worſt, is all the Rebellion can be objected againſt them in all that paſt Age, till the quiet ſettlement of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great.</p>
                  <p>But the good Providence of God has well clear'd them from the neceſſity of that excuſe, having ſet them out an Employment ſo juſt, and ſo fortunate for their Arms, that all who love, and who ſhall for future Ages love the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of <hi>France,</hi> and the Greatneſs of the Royal Family, will have perpetual reaſon to bleſs the timely ſuccour of this Party, and to praiſe God, who rais'd them for the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Let us come to their condition, after that <hi>Henry</hi> the Great was eſtabliſh'd on His Throne. The King being turn'd <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, and ſeeing his Party of the Reformed Religion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and in trouble, as expos'd afreſh to what they had afore tried, gave them Places of Security for about twenty years.</p>
                  <p>This was the Ground-work of all their Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and I am much inclin'd to believe that this was procur'd for them by thoſe who projected their ruine. For their Enemies might well think, that a King that underſtands his Intereſt, would not long ſufler in the heart of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom places aſſign'd for Protection, againſt Himſelf in effect, and to make reſiſtance, in caſe he kept not all his promiſes. That theſe Places would be retreats for all diſcontented Perſons, and Incendiaries that would trouble the State. That Strangers ſeeing in <hi>France</hi> a Party ſtrengthen'd with Gariſons, and holding themſelves in perpetual defiance, would never leave bidding them to cock up, and fomenting
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:109071:125"/>
their diſcontents. That this thorn in the foot of <hi>France</hi> would always hinder it from advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; and after all, that this would be a kind of dangerous Diſcipline in a State; to accuſtom Subjects to repreſent their Grievances with Sword in Hand.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, they might well fore-ſee, that the Reform'd being ſeiz'd of theſe places, would not quit them at the end of the term aſſign'd, imagining that the enjoyment of their Religion, of their Goods, and of their Lives, depended all on their keeping of theſe Places; and that by their refuſal, they would oblige the King to win them by force; which would make them Criminals, odious, and objects of the Juſtice and Vegeance of an incens'd Maſter.</p>
                  <p>And even ſo it happen'd. For their term for holding theſe places being expir'd, the King demands them again, and having at their inſtant requeſt prolong'd their term for three or four years, at length wiſely reſolv'd to force them; this gave occaſion for the Aſſembly of <hi>Rochel,</hi> where moſt imprudently, and contrary to their duty to God and the King, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to hold the Places by force; a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of deſpair ill-grounded. For though the King ſhew'd himſelf favourable to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Religion, after he had taken theſe Places by his Arms, he would have been yet more favourable to them, had they render'd the Places humbly and peaceably at his demand.</p>
                  <p>When the Aſſembly of <hi>Rochel</hi> began, was held the National Synod of <hi>Alaix,</hi> in which the famous <hi>Du Moulin</hi> was Preſident. In that Country where many of theſe Places of Security were, he apply'd himſelf ſeriouſly to conſider
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:109071:126"/>
the poſture of the Affairs of his Party, to ſound their Inclinations, and to give them good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. And he found that <hi>the greateſt and the beſt part</hi> was diſpos'd to render their Places to the King, and did not at all approve of the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Aſſembly of <hi>Rochel,</hi> of which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he thought himſelf oblig'd to inform that Aſſembly; and having return'd home, he writ them an excellent Letter, a Copy whereof I have procur'd, which is as follows:</p>

                           <hi>I</hi> Write not to you, to pour my Sorrows into your Boſoms, or entertain you with my partcular Afflictions. I need no Conſolation on that account, thinking my ſelf greatly Honour'd, that in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affliction of the Church, it pleaſes God to ſet me the foremoſt. I ſhould account my ſelf very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, if all the Storm might fall on my Head. So that I might be the only Sufferer, and the Church of God continue in Peace and Proſperity. One Care more preſſing, has mov'd me to write to you, and has forc'd Nature, which was ever averſe from medling with Publick Affairs, and acting beyond my Calling. For ſeeing the Church generally in eminent danger, and upon the brink of a Precipice, it was impoſſible for me to hold from ſpeaking. Nor can I be ſilent in this urgent neceſſity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making my ſelf guilty of inſenſibility, and of cruelty towards the Church of God. And, I hope, in ſpeaking my Thoughts about Publick Affairs, my Domeſtick Affliction will deliver me from jealouſie in your Opinion. And if I be not believ'd, at leaſt I may be excus'd.</p>
                        <p>I confeſs indeed, it does not become me to give Counſel to an Aſſembly of Perſons, choſen out of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:109071:126"/>
all the Kingdom, to bear the weight of Publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in a time ſo full of difficulty; but I think it for your advantage to be inform'd rightly what is the Opinion, and what the Diſpoſition of our Churches, from perſons that have a particular knowledge of them.</p>
                        <p>The queſtion then being, whether you ought to break up your Aſſembly, in Obedience to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, or continue to hold together, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the Affairs of the Churches; I am bound to tell you, that it is the general deſire of our Churches, that it might pleaſe God we may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in peace, by obeying His Majeſty. And that ſeeing the King reſolv'd to make himſelf obey'd by force of Arms, they aſſure themſelves, that you will to your power endeavour to avoid this Tempeſt, and rather yield to neceſſity, than engage them in a War that will moſt certainly ruin the greateſt part of our Churches, and will plunge us in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, whereof we well ſee the beginning, but know not at all the end. By obeying the King, you will take away their pretence, who incenſe his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to perſecute us. And if we are to be perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, all they who fear God, deſire that this may be for the Profeſſion of the Goſpel, and that our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution may truly be the Croſs of Chriſt. In a word, Sirs, I can aſſure you, that <hi>the greateſt and the beſt</hi> part of our Churches deſire your Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly may break up, if it can be done with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to your Perſons: and even many of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, love that Publick Peace are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually about us, praying and exhorting us, that we may not, by throwing our ſelves down the Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, involve them in our ruin.</p>
                        <p>On this occaſion I need not repreſent to you the general conſternation of our poor Flocks, who caſt
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:109071:127"/>
their Eyes upon you as Perſons that may procure their quiet; and by yielding to neceſſity, may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert that ſtorm ſo ready to break upon their heads. Many already have forſaken the Conntry, many have quitted their Religion, from whence you may judge what a diſtraction there will be, ſhould theſe troubles go on farther.</p>
                        <p>Nor need I more recommend to you, to have a tender care for the preſervation of our poor Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, knowing that you will rather chuſe Death, than draw upon you the reproach, that you have haſten'd on the perſecution of the Church, and deſtroy'd that which the zeal of our Fathers had planted, and brought this State into confuſion.</p>

And there is none of you that having ſent his Servant any whither, or given him leave to go, does not think you have power to call him back again.

                        <p>There are alſo repreſented to you many Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and Controventions to the Kings Edicts; which Complaints to our great ſorrow, are but too true: yet, without alledging that we our ſelves have given the occaſion of many of theſe Evils; the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty lies not in repreſenting our Grievances, but in finding redreſs. Conſider then, whether the

continuance of your Aſſembly may heal theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies, whether your Seſſion may put our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es under ſhelter, provide neceſſaries for a War where the Parties are ſo unequal, Levy Forces and make a Fond for Payment; if all the good your Seſſion is capable to produce, ſhall be equivalent to the loſs of ſo many Churches that lye naked, and expos'd to the wrath of their Enemies; whether when they are beaten down, you can raiſe them again; whether in the manifeſt diviſion that is amongſt us, you have the power to bring together all the ſcatter'd parts of this divided Body, which were it well united, would yet be too weak to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it ſelf on the Defenſive.</p>
                        <p>Pardon me, Sirs, if I tell you, that you will not find all thoſe of our Religion diſpos'd to obey your Reſolutions; and that the fire being kindl'd all about you, you will remain feeble Spectators of the ruin that you have made to tumble upon your heads. Beſides, you cannot be ignorant that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny amongſt us, of the beſt quality, and moſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to defend us, condemn openly your Actions, imagining and expreſſing that to ſuffer for this Cauſe, is not to ſuffer for the Cauſe of God. Theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no kind of reſiſtance, and opening the Gates of their places, and joyning their Arms to thoſe of the King, you may eaſily gather what the loſs will be, and what a weakning of your Party. How many perſons of our Nobility will forſake you, ſome by Treachery, others through weakneſs? Even they that in an Aſſembly are the moſt vehement, and that to appear zealous, are altogether for violent courſes, are moſt commonly thoſe that revolt, and that betray their Brethren. They hurry our poor Churches into the greateſt danger, and there leave them, and run away after that they have ſet the Houſe on fire.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="240" facs="tcp:109071:128"/>If a Fight, or the Siege of a Town ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, whatever might be the event of the Fight or Siege, it would prove a difficult thing to contain the People animated againſt us, and to hinder them from falling upon our Churches, that have neither Defence or Retreat. And whatever Orders the Magiſtrates of the contrary Religion ſhould give, it will be impoſſible for them to take effect.</p>
                        <p>I might alſo repreſent to you many Reaſons ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the State of our Churches, both within and out of the Kingdom, to let you ſee that this Commotion is altogether ill-tim'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, and that it is to ſail againſt Wind and Tide. But you are wiſe enough to ſee and conſider the poſture of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and from whence you may hope for ſuccor, and whether amongſt you the Virtue and the good Agreement, and the Quality of your Chiefs is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented or diminiſh'd. Certainly this is not the time when the troubling of that Pool will bring us a Cure. And it is plain, that if any thing can help us amidſt ſo much weakneſs, it muſt be the zeal of Religon, the which, in our Fathers time, did ſupport us, when we had leſs Strength and more Virtue. But in this cauſe you will find that Zeal very cool, becauſe <hi>the moſt part of our People</hi> believes that this Evil might have been prevented, without making a breach in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Aſſure your ſelves, there will always be Diviſions amongſt us, when we ſhall ſtir upon ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil accounts, and not directly for the Cauſe of the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p>Againſt all this, 'tis Objected, That our Enemies have reſolv'd our ruin. That they undermine us by little and little, and that we had better begin preſently, than attend longer.</p>
                        <p>'Tis very true, he muſt want common Senſe,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:109071:128"/>
that doubts of their ill-will Mean time, when I reflect on our ſeveral Loſſes, as that of <hi>Letoure,</hi> of <hi>Privas,</hi> and of <hi>Bearn;</hi> I find that our ſelves have contributed thereto: and we are not at all to wonder if our Enemies are not much in pain to ſet us right, and if they joyn with us to undo us. But herein it does not follow, that we ſhould throw the Helve after the Hatchet, and ſet fire to our own Houſe, becauſe others are reſolv'd to burn it, or undertake to remedy particular Evils by means weak for that end, but ſtrong and effectual for the general ruin. God, who ſo often has diverted the Counſels taken for our deſtruction, has not loſt his Power, neither has he chang'd his Will. We ſhall find that He is always the ſame, if we have the Grace to wait His aſſiſtance, and do not caſt our ſelves headlong, through our impatience, and daſh upon impoſſibilities.</p>
                        <p>Take this for certain, that though our Enemies ſeek our ruin, they will never attempt it openly, and will lay hold on ſome other pretence, more plauſible than that of Religion, which we never ought to give them. If we contain our ſelves in the Obedience that Subjects owe to their Soveraign, we ſhall ſee that whilſt our Enemies hope in vain, that we ſhall make our ſelves Criminals by ſome Diſobedience. God will cut them out ſome other work, and furniſh us with occaſious to teſtifie to his Majeſty, that we are a Body profitable to his State, and thereby put him in mind of the ſignal Services our Churches have paid to the late King of Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Memory. But if we are ſo unfortunate, that whilſt we keep to our Duty, the Calamnies of our Enemies prevail; at the leaſt, we ſhall have this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, that we have been juſt on our ſide, and that we have teſtified, that we love the peace of the State.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="242" facs="tcp:109071:129"/>Notwithſtanding all this, Sirs, you can, and you ought to give order for the ſecurity of your Perſons. For His Majeſty and His Council having ſaid of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, That if you will ſeparate, He will leave to our Churches the enjoyment of Peace, and of the benefit of his Edicts; it is not reaſonable that your ſeparation ſhould be made with danger to your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And when you ſhall require that you may ſeparate with ſafety, I make no doubt but you will eaſily obtain your deſires, provided that you inſiſt upon what is poſſible, and ſuch things as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of the Times, and the preſent neceſſity may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. It remains, that whilſt you are together, you adviſe what ought to be done, in caſe you may be oppreſt, notwithſtanding your ſeparation.

                  <p>When this Letter was read in the Aſſembly, which did not at all approve it, ſome aroſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, went from the Aſſembly, and never return'd more; And all found in the end, that the Advertiſements of this Holy Perſon were Propheſies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:109071:129"/>It appears then, that notwithſtanding the great Temptations of Fear and Deſpair, that mov'd this Aſſembly to reſiſt the King, their reſiſtance was diſavow'd by <hi>the beſt and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Party</hi> of the Reform'd Churches of <hi>France,</hi> and that they were exhorted to obey the King by their Divines, who, in matters of Conſcience, are the repreſentative Body of the Church, when they are Solemnly Aſſembl'd. Now this was the Senſe of the National Synod, of which this eminent Perſon came from being the Preſident. 'Tis then wrongfully that the Noble Marqueſs taxes all our Party with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, when as our Theologians declar'd themſelves ſo ſtrongly againſt it; the moſt of thoſe that held theſe Places of Security, open'd their Gates to the King; and more than three Fourths of his Subjects of the Reform'd Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion kept in their Obedience.</p>
                  <p>I cannot omit, that in the greateſt heat of thoſe who reſiſted, there yet remained many glances of Loyaly and Love for their King. I ſhall obſerve two: At the Siege of <hi>Montaubon,</hi> the moſt obſtinately defended of all the other Sieges, the King and his Court paſſed before the Walls, from whence they were ſhooting moſt furiouſly: but when the Beſieged beheld his Majeſty, they left off ſhooting, and cry'd out with a great force, <hi>Long live the King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The inſtance of <hi>Rochel</hi> is more remarkable, and it is very memorable. The <hi>Rochellers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd, implored the aſſiſtance of <hi>England,</hi> which was offer'd them; but the Duke of <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham</hi> came late, ſo that the <hi>Rochellers</hi> after they had eaten the Horſes, were now eating their Saddles. In this great extremity the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:109071:130"/>
Duke told their Deputies, that if they would deliver the Town to the King of <hi>England,</hi> they ſhould be aſſiſted effectually. The Deputies refus'd, and the <hi>Rochellers</hi> reſolv'd to undergo all the rigours that their King, provok'd, would exerciſe upon them, rather than deliver the Town to a ſtranger. This juſt King had notice thereof, and treated them the more mildly at the Surrender, overcoming, like a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> evil with good.</p>
                  <p>The Noble Marqueſs does the quite contrary, for he ſtudies to overcome good with evil; diſplaying our Faults, with all the aggravation, and concealing our Services. He ſays, That <hi>the ſpirit of the</hi> Huguenots <hi>is always ready for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts, for Confuſion and Anarchy. That there will be more than an hundred thouſand men of the Kings Enemies in the bowels of his Kingdom, ſo long as there ſhall be</hi> Huguenots <hi>in</hi> France; <hi>and that perhaps they wait only an occaſion to riſe up in Arms.</hi> He pretends even to know their hearts, ſaying, That <hi>they have in their hearts the ſame hatred they had;</hi> which are words flung out with more animoſity than reaſon.</p>
                  <p>For 'tis but ill Logick, that they are all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, becauſe about a ſix part of their number took up Arms, in their defence, to keep ſome Places of ſafety; and that becauſe they have ſin'd they never have repented. If all they who have been engag'd in the Troubles of the State, within theſe laſt forty years, are to be thought the Kings Enemies for ever; His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would find few Perſons in his Kingdom whom he might truſt; and now forty years are paſt ſince the War for thoſe Places of ſafety, was ended. When the Body is in a Fever,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:109071:130"/>
the good humors are ſtir'd as well as the bad, and all ſettle again when the Diſeaſe is over. The ſame is in the Body of a State; it is ſubject to hot fits that enflame both good and bad; but all grow cool and quiet in time, by the wiſdom of the Sovereign, and by the repentance of thoſe that are honeſt good men. To upbraid them as Rebells and Enemies, that took up Arms againſt their duty, and laid them down again forty years ago; this is to violate the Laws of <hi>Amneſty,</hi> without which no State could ſubſiſt. Kings being the Lieutenants of God, ought to deal with their Subjects as God does with his. He forgives and forgets offences; and makes them faithful that were diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, through his Benefits.</p>
                  <p>The Proteſtants of <hi>Languedoc</hi> ſtay'd not for the Kings Benefits, till they teſtifi'd their Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and their Oblivion of what they had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd in the reduction of the Places that they had held, than when their wounds were yet bleeding. This was when the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> in <hi>Longuedoc,</hi> where he was Governor, made a Party againſt the King, hoping to find the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, who are in great numbers in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, ready for an Inſurrection from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of their late Sufferings. But he found the quite contrary; for they all joyn'd as one man with the Kings Forces, and did him excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Service in a battel where the Duke was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and taken, and a Biſhop with him. The old Marſhall <hi>De la Force,</hi> who had ſcap'd the Maſſacre of St. <hi>Barth olomew,</hi> by hiding himſelf under the Carkaſſes of his Brothers, whoſe Throats were cut, was one of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Commanders in this Action.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:109071:131"/>That Marqueſs confeſſes, That <hi>in the Wars at</hi> Paris, <hi>they put themſelves in Arms, and with great reſpect proteſted, that they were at the Kings Service;</hi> and their Actions would have juſtify'd their Proteſtations, if His Majeſty had had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for their Service.</p>
                  <p>I will not looſe time and pains in making Reflections upon the fourteen ways he propoſes to torment us, and make us weary of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, of our Country, and our Lives. Ways enough are found out, without his propoſing. And now, becauſe the King, of late years, has had much to do with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> it has been a part of the Policy of <hi>France,</hi> whilſt they affront the Pope, at the ſame time to treat us with ſome extraordinary Severity, to prevent the ſuſpicion of Hereſie. We humble our ſelves under the powerfull hand of God, and under that of our Sovereign; confeſſing that we are juſtly chaſtis'd for our ſins. For the reſt, we know in whom we have truſted, and ſhelter our ſelves under the Hand that ſtrikes us; aſſuring our ſelves, that it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect us, and that we ſhall find Jeſus Chriſt our Redeemer, and his Spirit our Comforter, both in this Life and in that which is to come.</p>
                  <p>As the Marqueſs is very exact in giving In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to ruine us, he does the ſame towards the end of his Book for <hi>England;</hi> counting it a Nation that is good for nothing but to be ruin'd. We cannot take the advantage of theſe Inſtructions given againſt us, to defend our ſelves againſt them, for we are a Body meerly paſſive, expos'd, and ſubmitted to all that God and the King will do with us. But for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> when he has diſoblig'd them by
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:109071:131"/>
the moſt odious Character that his Malice could furniſh his Eloquence withall; He obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them, in publiſhing all thoſe ways that muſt be taken to deſtroy them; for it is likely, that being told of them, they will look to themſelves. Mean time, his Readers will ſay of him, that they who tell aforehand of their cunning, are not very cunning.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe that the noble Marqueſs terms us Rebels and Enemies of the State, after the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confeſſion of our Faults, which I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cloak'd nor diſſembl'd; I will take the boldneſs to compare them with thoſe of ſome of the Gentlemen of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Jeſuits and their Diſciples: and that they that are not pre-poſſeſt with paſſion may judge, whether to them rather, or to us, belongs the title, Of Enemies of the State, Let us conſider the Actions and the Doctrine of the one and the other,</p>
                  <p>For the Actions, the horrible attempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sacred Perſons of our Kings, by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks and Scholars of the Jeſuits, and all the Enormities of the League, to deſtroy our Kings, our Laws, and our Monarchy, and to transfer it to a ſtranger; carry away without diſpute the prize of Villany, from thoſe who being poſſeſt with a fear ill-grounded, have with Arms defended the Places that were lent to them by Edict, for the ſecurity of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, of their Goods, and of their Lives. Add hereto, that they had their hearts big with the ſenſe of their incomparable Service to the Crown, and believ'd they well deſerv'd what theſe endeavour'd to keep.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:109071:132"/>And as for the Doctrine, theſe never read Lectures of Rebellion and Parricide. And the reſiſtance ſome of the Party made againſt the King, was condemn'd by their Divines, whoſe writings are full of Leſſons of Obedience, and of Fidelity to their Sovereigns. Whereas thoſe of the Jeſuits, and their Diſciples, teach the people to caſt off and kill their King, ſo often as it may pleaſe the Pope to Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate him. <hi>France</hi> has felt the Effects of this Doctrine during the long Wars of the League; and it was the Books and the Sermons that made the Sword be drawn, and that ſharpen'd the Daggers for the Murder of our Kings, whilſt the Proteſtants expos'd their Lives for their Preſervation.</p>
                  <p>Now I am content to let paſs what is paſt, provided the ſame may be done to us. Let us fix upon the preſent. Whom ought you to eſteem the Enemies of the State, thoſe who ſubject the Crown of our Kings abſolutely to the Papal Mitre, and who acknowledge another Sovereign than the King; or they who own him their only Sovereign, and maintain that his Crown depends not ſave on God alone? What, in Conſcience, is the true ground of the great hatred that is born us? is it not for that, if we are to be believ'd, there would not in <hi>France</hi> be any French-man that is not the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, Cauſes Beneficial and Matrimonial would not be carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> nor the Kingdom be Tributary under the ſhadow of <hi>Annates,</hi> and the like Impoſitions.</p>
                  <p>And on this Subject, the Teſtimony of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Perron</hi> for us, in his Harangue to the Third State, is very conſiderable; whe<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> he
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:109071:132"/>
ſays, <hi>The Doctrine of the Depoſition of Kings, by the Pope, has been held in</hi> France <hi>until</hi> Calvin. Whereby he tacitely acknowledges, That our Kings had been ill ſerv'd before; and that thoſe he calls Hereticks having brought to light the Holy Scripture, have made the Right of Kings be known, which had been kept ſuppreſt.</p>
                  <p>Shall they be ſaid Friends of the State, who owning themſelves Subjects of a Stranger So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, dare endeavour to make themſelves Maſters of all the Temporal Juriſdiction? of which the Marqueſs complains loudly, and with good cauſe; and of the great reſiſtance they have made to maintain themſelves in an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation ſo unreaſonable. In this kind, thoſe of the Church of the Reform'd Religion could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be accus'd, in the Towns where we have had ſome Power.</p>
                  <p>Our Religion is hated, becauſe it combats the Pride, the Avarice, and the Uſur pations of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their Subſtitutes in the Kingdom; and becauſe we have ſhewn to the World that ſordid Bank of spiritual Graces they have planted in the Church, and how they have drawn to themſelves a Third of the Lands of <hi>France,</hi> for fear of Purgatory, from ſilly Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, mop'd with a blind Devotion, and from Robbers and Extortioners, who have thought to make Peace with God by letting theſe ſhare in the booty.</p>
                  <p>'Tis an advice very ſuitable to the <hi>Politicks</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> to examine well the Controverſies that are moſt gainful to the Clergy, as this of Purgatory, concerning which an old Poet ſaid the Truth, in his way of Drollery.</p>

                     <l>But if it be ſo,</l>
                     <l>That no more Souls ſhall go</l>
                     <l>To old Purgatory,</l>
                     <l>Then the Pope will gain nought by the Story.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>It would be wiſely done to examine what neceſſity there is for ſo many Begging-Fryers, that ſuck out the Blood and Marrow of devout People; and for ſo many Markets of Pardons in honour of a number of Saints of a new Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and for what deſign are made ſo many Controverſies. And whether it would not be a great Treaſure for the Kings Subjects to Teach them to work out their Salvation, and put their Conſciences in quiet at a cheaper rate.</p>
                  <p>God, juſtly provok'd, by the great Sins of <hi>France,</hi> gives us not yet the Grace of that Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Truth, <hi>St. John, Ch. 8. Know the Truth, and the Truth will ſet you free.</hi> And though it ſhines out ſo clear, to let us ſee the Uſurpation of the Popes upon the Temporals of the King, and upon the Spirituals of the Church; yet ſee we not clearly enough to diſcover all the myſtery of Iniquity, and to reſolve to ſhake off the Yoak.</p>
                  <p>For this great deſign, no other War need be made by the Pope, but only take from him all Juriſdiction in <hi>France,</hi> all Annates, and all evo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Cauſes to <hi>Rome.</hi> This would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produce any other ſtirrs, but the complaints and murmuring of them that are looſers. And the condition, truly Royal, that the King at preſent is in, will ſufficiently ſecure Him from Inſurrections at home, and Invaſions from abroad.

                  <p>The two main Intereſts of <hi>France,</hi> being to weaken the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the Princes of which encloſe him on both ſides; and to throw off the yoake of <hi>Rome,</hi> which holds a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy within the French Monarchy; 'tis eaſie to judge that amongſt the Kings Subjects, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants are abſolutely the moſt proper to ſerve him on both theſe occaſions. I know that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> as well Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks as Seculars, there are excellent Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſerve the King in both theſe Intereſts. But there is need of great caution to well aſſure him, by reaſon of the multitude of Jeſuits Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, with whom theſe Fathers have Induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly fill'd all Profeſſions of the State and Church; and it is for no other end that they have ſo many Colledges. They who have been too good Scholars of theſe Maſters, are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to both theſe Intereſts, being ſo great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, that they eſpouſe the Intereſt of the Catholick King, to advance that of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But to find amongſt the Proteſtants tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty Inſtruments for both theſe accounts, he need not try them; they are fitted and form'd, by their Education, for theſe two Uſes, ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs aſſures His Majeſty, with good reaſon of the friendſhip of the Proteſtant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Germany,</hi> which they would never teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſo freely, as in ſerving him to ruin the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Pope, who ſavours that of the Houſe
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:109071:134"/>
of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> For thereby they would kill two Birds with one Stone. Not to mention our other Neighbours, who have broken with <hi>Rome,</hi> and being diſquieted by its ſecret practiſes, will be ready to contribute to its deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Who ſhall well conſider the Scheme of the Affairs of Chriſtendem, ſhall judge, that all things invite His Majeſty to ſhut out the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of <hi>Rome</hi> beyond the Mountains; Right, Honour, Profit, Liberty, Facility, his Duty to his Crown, to his Subjects, and to his Royal Poſterity; and that many Aids ſmile up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, both within, and out of his Kingdom, for ſo fair and ſo juſt an Enterprize.</p>
                  <p>This is the warm deſire of the honeſt <hi>French</hi>-men. And none there are who better deſerve that Title, than they, who, with the moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, reſent that their Kings ſhould kiſs the Feet of that Prelate, who ought of Right to kiſs their Feet, for having receiv'd his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities from Kings of <hi>France;</hi> and who, in recompence of their good Deeds, have plotted, and plot continually their ruin.</p>
                  <p>When the King ſhall have deliver'd Himſelf and his People, from this ſtrange yoak, he will find the enmity amongſt his Subjects, for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Religon, greatly diminiſht; and the way open to a re-union. And were the difficulties about the Doctrine overcome, the Proteſtants would not ſtick much at the Diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>God, who is the Father of Kings, and the King of Glory, protect and ſtrengthen our Great King, to accomplſh the Deſigns that turn to the general good of His Church, to the greatneſs, and to the reſpect of his Sacred Perſon, and to the Peace and Proſperity of His State.</p>
