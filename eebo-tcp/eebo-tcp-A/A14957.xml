            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>LEt not children haue their pleasures in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of their garments, some delight to haue them iagged and cut: but such fantasticknesse ought to be reformed by wiser and elder, considering their foolishnesse is beyond measure, if all may bee done at their pleasure: and ancient writers repute them out of their wits and mad men that fauour it.</p>
               <p>Againe, painted and gawdy apparrell is not so fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticke in childrens eyes; but as costly to the parents purses, whereby ancient writers proclaime such pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents fellow-fooles with their children.</p>
               <p>The modesty and decency of the vestments of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are strong and good, not curious to the eye alone: And such as are cleane and without fowlnesse or fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse: Which after the estate and meanes of the parents ought to bee principall, so long as by the crafts man it be made with reasonable, and good form and fashion.</p>

               <head>How to order a childe in his diet for drinke.</head>
               <p>FOr a childe to make the beginning of his dinner drinke, is a good way to br√©ed him vp to drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Especially, if he take it for wanton custome, and not for necessity of thirst. It is dishonest to bee suffered, and anoysome to the health of the body of a childe.</p>
               <p>Let not a childe drinke after he hath supt hot broth, immediately vpon it; much lesse if he haue b√©ene fed with milke.</p>
               <p>Let not a childe drinke aboue twice or thrice at the most at one meale, and that gently, and not without reason: who bestoweth wine and beere on his childe beyond reason, defameth and abuseth him more by dishonouring his reason, and prouoking him to an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable diet.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>To moderate the appetite of a childe from saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinesse and being liquorish.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>SOcrates</hi> being olde, would not drinke of the first cup: for why? his braine was light, and the first drinke is euer the most fuming and ouercomming.</p>
               <p>If thy childe be set with his betters, let his hand be last in the dish. And that hee doe it not at all, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he bee first bidden. Neither suffer your children
<pb facs="tcp:2284:13"/>
to put their hands or fingers into brothes, sawces caudles, or such like, at the table especially. Other wise let correction bridle their wantonnesse.</p>
               <p>If he be of sensible y√©eres, let him forbeare his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in a dish, and vse a knife without chusing at his pleasure: for it is vns√©emely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Homer</hi> often reprehendeth sawcinesse in these <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> such like words, <hi>They boldly put their hands into the meat that is set before them.</hi> And as it is vns√©emely to a liquorish person to traine his hands to euery side of the dish, so is it more vile to turne the best morsels in a dish towards thy selfe.</p>
               <p>To gnaw bones belongeth ch√©efly to doggs, but is is a ciuill thing to picke them cleane with a knife.</p>
               <p>The licking of a dish belongeth to cats and dogs and not to children nor men, be the reliques neuer so sw√©et, and betokeneth liquorishnesse, not manners.</p>
               <p>To drinke or speake with meat in the mouth, is most vnciuill and dangerous withall.</p>
               <p>Let the children rise from the boord when nature is sufficed, either by asking leaue, or withdrawing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
               <p>Let children beare away with them their tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, saluting their parents, and first the ch√©efe in the company, then the rest.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2284:14"/>
               <p>When the dinner is ended, let children euer bee ready to giue God thankes: euery man holding their peace, let the children turne their faces reuerently to him that sitteth vppermost at the boord, saying:</p>

               <p>EUerlasting God, which of thy free abundance hast bestowed vpon all mankinde all things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and hast prouided for all men, such sundry graces, as in thy fatherly wisdome are meetest: Powre vpon me (thy most vnworthy seruant) the spirit of vnderstanding, knowledge, and vtterance, and reueale vnto me (O Lord God) the hidden secrets of thy glorious Gospell, that whatsoeuer I shall stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, read, thinke, say, or doe, it may redound to thy honour and praise: O Lord guide my heart &amp; tongue aright, that I may (with sence and reason) compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what I shall read, or what I shall bee taught: To the end, that vnderstanding the right, I may not any way erre: But with purenesse and sanctitie of heart I may euer praise thy most magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and euerlasting name, through Iesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

               <head>A Prayer to be sayd by children after they haue studied, at their going to bed.</head>
               <p>I Giue thee most humble and hearty thanks, O most gracious &amp; blessed Father of heauen, in that it hath pleased thee, of thy most gracious goodnesse, to heare my request. O Lord still giue me grace to go onward in vnderstanding and knowledge, that I may euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more praise thy holy name, and grant me thy grace to amend my life, and to returne vnfainedly vnto thy seruice. And for as much as no creature can breath without thy protection and fauour, vouchsafe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thy mercies vnto mee this night, that I may peaceably and quietly take that rest, which thou hast appointed for the refreshment of my body and minde, the night and darknesse being by thy goodnesse ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as a time conuenient to take the same in, and to cease from our bodily labours. And grant vnto me (O Lord my God) who of my selfe am neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to lie downe, nor being laid able to rise vp, thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciall assistance &amp; help, that I may repose my selfe, and receiue (at thy mercifull hands) sw√©et and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable rest, not according to the gr√©edinesse of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, but as shall bee most expedient for the comfort and refreshing of my wearied body and mind,
<pb facs="tcp:2284:18"/>
that both may be strengthened and enabled to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with that study and exercise, which thou hast or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and appointed for me. Lastly, grant me true repentance for my sinnes, blesse and defend my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, brethren, sisters, kinsfolke, neighbours, and others, whom thou wouldst I should commend to thy fatherly protection, wheresoeuer they remaine, and for the more true and zealous calling vnto th√©e for these things, giue me grace in faith, to say that prayer which thy sonne Iesus Christ hath taught mee saying, O our Father which art in heauen, &amp;c.</p>
