            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am ſo far from believing the <hi>World</hi> will be ſurpriſed with the <hi>Publication</hi> of this <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Volume,</hi> ſince 'tis no more than what I have <hi>promiſed</hi> once and again in my <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Firſt,</hi> that I am ready to <hi>flatter my ſelf</hi> it has been waited for with <hi>Longing Expectations;</hi> eſpecially when I conſider what a <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>general Reception</hi> has been given to the <hi>former Part;</hi> though it has not, at the ſame time, (according to the <hi>Fate</hi> of <hi>Things of this kind,</hi>) eſcaped without the <hi>Harſh</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102383:3"/>
and <hi>Malevolent Cenſures</hi> of ſome; as if the <hi>Letters</hi> were not only not <hi>Genuine,</hi> but the whole of a <hi>Suppoſititious Extract</hi> and <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal:</hi> But I have ſaid ſo much upon this <hi>Head</hi> already, as may in Reaſon ſatisfie the <hi>ſcrupulous Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity</hi> of any <hi>ingenious</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted Perſon,</hi> and therefore I ſhall concern my ſelf no further with it.</p>
            <p>But as I have not failed to be <hi>copious</hi> in a <hi>Vindication</hi> of the <hi>Work</hi> in my <hi>Firſt Preface,</hi> ſo I have been as <hi>ſparing</hi> to expatiate upon the <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>Excellency</hi> of the <hi>Diſcoveries;</hi> leaving that whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Obſervation</hi> of the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Reader,</hi> as I do it alſo in this; wherein I foreſee he will be much better ſatisfied with me, than for my <hi>Silence</hi> in reſpect to
<pb facs="tcp:102383:3"/>
the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of this laſt <hi>Correſpondence,</hi> where ſo much <hi>Danger</hi> and <hi>Difficulty</hi> muſt be apprehended to be, and which I find as difficult to gratifie him with a <hi>Diſcovery</hi> of, any further than the <hi>Letters</hi> themſelves intimate; eſpecially that now the <hi>Author</hi> is actually <hi>abroad</hi> again, and by his <hi>Abſence</hi> contributes a <hi>double Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> for my <hi>Excuſe,</hi> and the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s <hi>Diſappointment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some may be apt to wonder theſe <hi>Letters</hi> ſhould be ſo few, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, bear ſo little <hi>Proportion</hi> to thoſe that make up the <hi>Firſt Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume:</hi> But as a <hi>manifeſt Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> in the <hi>Duration</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> as well as the <hi>different Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> of <hi>Things</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> while theſe <hi>laſt</hi> were written, are <hi>Irrefragable Arguments</hi> againſt

any <hi>Cavils</hi> that may be ſuggeſted by reaſon of ſuch a <hi>contracted Compaſs:</hi> So the fame <hi>Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is no leſs a <hi>Proof</hi> of the <hi>candid Management,</hi> ſince 'tis far enough from being <hi>impoſſible,</hi> but an <hi>Able Head</hi> might have found out <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Means,</hi> to have made the <hi>Second Volume</hi> of theſe <hi>Letters</hi> to ſwell up to the Bigneſs of the <hi>Firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, after all, I do confeſs, I did not think, when I <hi>publiſhed</hi> the <hi>Firſt Part,</hi> that theſe <hi>Papers</hi> (then Rude, and Undigeſted) would have been couched in ſo ſmall a <hi>Room:</hi> And therefore I have found my ſelf under a kind of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> to make up the <hi>Defect,</hi> by the <hi>Subſequent Treatiſe;</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, I cannot but expect, ſomething ſhould be required to be

                  <p>WHen I had diſpatch'd away my laſt to your Lordſhip, I did not expect a ſudden opportunity, if at all, to revive my correſpondence with you, the mighty change that hath been wrought in <hi>England,</hi> having quite ſtopped up the ways of my former Conveyance. But revolving fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with my ſelf, that it would be a matter highly grateful to your Lordſhip, to have from time to time, ſome ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Affairs of this Country; I have left nothing uneſſay'd, whereby I might be in a capacity to gratify your cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, and ſo have now, ſooner indeed than my own expectations, found out a way that I hope, (though my fears are alſo very great) now and then may effect it, which is by — though I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102383:9"/>
muſt alſo inform your Lordſhip, that there is a more than ordinary care and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection uſed now to keep all Court-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues from taking Air, by frequent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of their Cyphers, Entries, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Methods. Your Lordſhip knows beſt how the face of things appear in <hi>England,</hi> upon ſo grand a Revolution; they put the beſt Meen they can upon it here, and tho' there is a fair ſhew made at Court of it, yet nothing is more certain than that the Kingdom is in a general Conſternation, of which ſurprizing marks are to be ſeen as well in the <hi>Lovre,</hi> as in <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Provinces: Some have ſmiled here, and I doubt not of your Lordſhip and our Friends in <hi>England</hi> ſmiling too, when I tell you, that the <hi>French</hi> King aſtoniſhed, and not knowing how to believe, that the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> have been Crowned in <hi>England,</hi> and proclaimed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> has asked ſeveral times a day, whether the News was true or no; ſo dreadful to him is that fatal Accident, and which has made him diſpoſe of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies into all Quarters, where there can be any ſemblance of Danger, as if he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be attacked every way. But all theſe terrors from without, makes the Court abate nothing of their vigorous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the peaceable remains of the reformed within, ſo that upon the leaſt ſuſpition of any meetings of them, they run from all the Neighbouring parts to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102383:9"/>
circumvent them. For there being a report lately raiſed in <hi>Perigord,</hi> that a religious aſſembly of <hi>Hugonots</hi> was held at the Houſe of one M. <hi>Dupare,</hi> the alarum Bell was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately rung, and all the Town got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ran to the Houſe, but found no body in it, ſave a few Children: But this did not hinder the Neighbouring Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages to take the Allarm, who run in heaps to Maſſacre the <hi>Hugonots</hi> and Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi> whom they believe to be always at their heels: And ſuch Pannick Terrors does the apprehenſion of him ſtrike into them, that about the ſame time, the Preacher of <hi>Sarlate</hi> was forſaken by all his Auditors upon an imaginary Rumour, thought to be ſpread abroad, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was at the Gates of <hi>Regaudi</hi>

                  <p>YOur Lordſhip may perhaps call to mind what I formerly tranſmitted to you out of our Minutes, concerning the efforts made by this Crown, to induce the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> to a Neutrality in the War formed by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102383:11"/>
                     <hi>France</hi> againſt the Republick of <hi>Holland</hi> and her then Confederates; And I am now to acquaint you, there have been the like and greater efforts made to keep that ſame Crown from falling into the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Allies againſt her, though both the attempts have failed of the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſucceſs. Its true the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thought fit to temporize the latter end of the laſt Year, and the beginning of this, till they found the Revolution in <hi>England</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, and the Government reduced to a ſettled form, and then they made no bones openly to teſtify their Averſion to <hi>France,</hi> and her intereſt, as well as good-will to the Confederates at the ſame time, by ſuch Acts as gave evident ſigns both of the one and the other: And your Lordſhip cannot think how greatly mortified this Court is, at the News they have lately received of my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> King <hi>James</hi> his Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors being diſmiſt by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and that they would no longer own his Character. It has occaſion'd much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe here, and People daily vend their Sentiments upon it, as they are variouſly affected towards the parties concerned, and among other things I cannot forbear men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning one paſſage, which though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps already known to your Lordſhip; yet give me leave to pleaſe my ſelf (ſince I have nothing more momentous to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) with a ſhort relation of it. It ſeems upon the late King <hi>James</hi> his Acceſſion to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102383:12"/>
the Throne, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſador <hi>Don Ronquillo,</hi> took upon himſelf to adviſe him, not to ſuffer himſelf to be guided by Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars and Monks; the King for anſwer told him, <hi>That the Kings of</hi> Spain <hi>were wont to do it</hi>: The Embaſſador replied again, <hi>I know it Sir, but that is our misfortune.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Majeſty ought to take warning by our Example, and not to daſh your ſelf againſt that Rock; and ſurely if he had taken up with this Counſel, he might have been ſtill in great ſecurity upon his Throne, and his Embaſſador in the higheſt eſteem in <hi>Spain.</hi> But to return, the foremention'd prevarications in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> as they are pleaſed to denominate them here, has at length produc'd a Declaration of War againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> which has been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd by a Trumpeter to the Governor of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Netherlands, and the ſubſtance whereof is here ſubjoined. That the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned deſire his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty had to obſerve the Truce concluded on in the Year 1684. had cauſed him to take no notice of the demeanor of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, in the Courts of all the <hi>European</hi> Princes, where they had made it their whole buſineſs to animate the ſeveral Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to take up Arms againſt <hi>France</hi>; That His Majeſty is not ignorant of the ſhare they have had in the Negotiation of the League made at <hi>Ausburg</hi>; That he is alſo well acquainted with what ſhare the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Neatherlands has

lately had in the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize againſt the Kingdom of <hi>England:</hi> But that yet not being inclinable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that what was tranſacted by him, was done by his Catholick Majeſty's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty was in good hopes to have perſwaded his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majeſty, to have concurred with him for the effectual Reſtoration of the lawful King of <hi>England,</hi> and the preſervation of the Catholick Religion againſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant League that was formed; or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to have obſerved an exact Neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: To which purpoſe he had made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral propoſals that ſeemed to have been well received, ſo long as the ſucceſs of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> continued doubtful; but that when it came to be once known at <hi>Madrid,</hi> that the King of <hi>England</hi> had left his Dominions, that then nothing was me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated upon but a War againſt <hi>France</hi>; That his Chriſtian Majeſty was moreover further informed, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador in <hi>England,</hi> paid dayly viſits to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and was very importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with him to declare War againſt the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi>; That the Governour of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Low Countries was raiſing Men with utmoſt diligence, and had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the <hi>States General</hi> to joyn their Forces in the beginning of the Campaign; and laboured with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to ſend numbers of Men into <hi>Flanders.</hi> Of all which procedures he had informed his

Catholick Majeſty, and offered him a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere continuation of the Truce, provided he would give no ſuccour to his Majeſty's Enemies.

had a moſt tender Love and Affection for the Queen his Daughter, being deeply concerned at the News which portended his approaching Misfortune, had diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what had happened to the King, who at the ſame time took care to ſend away what the Queen deſir'd; But that by the time that the Courier was arrived at the City of <hi>Burgos,</hi> he met there with another who told him, that he was carrying the News of the Queen's Death.

Maſters Niece: They further add<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this conteſt continued and was ſpun out to a long time, under pretence of knowing the King's Pleaſure, and that at length, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long attendance, the Door was open'd to him, but yet at ſuch a time, when the Queen was ſo very ill, that ſhe could not ſpeak one word: That ſhe dyed within a ſhort while after, one Convulſion ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another till ſhe gave up the Ghoſt.

                  <p>I Can't forbear taking notice to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, tho' I have done it once and again al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, of the great difficulties I labour under to procure any true and certain intelligence of matters tranſacted on our ſide, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Affairs of <hi>England</hi>: And I can as little forbear endeavouring to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, whatever ſuch intelligence comes into my Hands, to your Honour, though it be accompanied with ſuch imminent danger, as you cannot but be a little ſenſible off, and which I heartily wiſh none of my Friends may ever have the black apprehenſions of, how much more your Lordſhip whom I ever have and ſhall Love and Honour. Wherefore be pleaſed to receive hereby the heads of thoſe Articles, agreed and concluded on the <hi>French</hi> King's part for the furthering the late King <hi>James,</hi> in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his abdicated Throne, and they are theſe following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> He doth Solemnly promiſe and engage to aſſiſt and promote the late King
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102383:17"/>
his dear Brother in his Pretenſions, with Men, Money, and all poſſible force both by Sea and Land; and firmly reſolves ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to lay down his Arms, or be at Peace with his Enemies, till ſuch time as his ſaid Brother ſhall be remounted on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne, and be peaceable poſſeſſor of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That till ſuch time as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Article ſhould be put in full Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and thoroughly accompliſhed, he hath obliged himſelf to ſupport him, the late King, and all his other dependants in his Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> or elſewhere, with all ſuitable grandeur and dignity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That he ſhould with utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition and application aſſiſt him with a competent number of Forces by Land, and a ſufficient Navy by Sea towards the reducing, under his Obedience the hoſtile part of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and not deſiſt till the ſame were entirely recovered unto him; And after that it were ſo reduced and ſubjected by their conjoint Arms, the late King ſhould be in poſſeſſion of it, till ſuch time as he ſhall be in full poſſeſſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne, but no longer: But how to unravel the later Clauſe of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle at preſent, is beyond my skill, and ſo I will leave it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He hath alſo over and above the preceding Engagements, promiſed to give him all the aſſiſtances neceſſary from time to time, both by Sea and Land, for

the recovery of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> unto him, when he ſhall arrive in one or either of the ſaid Kingdoms in Perſon, and in the mean time hath engaged to be aiding and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting to his party in either of the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as time and occaſion ſhould ſerve.</p>

on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Affairs with two Court-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which are of that Stamp, that for all their boaſting makes wiſe Men have but a poor opinion of the Event. For it cannot be thought that any great matters ſhould be done at <hi>Rome</hi> for the ſupport of the late King, though by this Court's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance and inſtigation, the Cardinal <hi>de Bovillon</hi> in a Congregation of Cardinals lately held there, propounded they ſhould Tax a voluntary Contribution upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for his ſupply, and that to ſet a good and laudable example unto others, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a conſiderable Summ: But by all that I could learn hitherto, the motion was not much reliſhed, and 'tis very likely the Congregation ſmoak the deſign, that the Cardinal thought that, the beſt way to find the <hi>French</hi> King his Maſter Money, who undoubtedly cannot but need it, and that he that ſupplies the one King, ſupplies the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; And if the firſt carries ſo little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of ſucceſs with it, I am ſure your Lordſhip will ſay the other has much leſs, and that to make Copper to paſs for Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Coin, forbodes a general diſatisfaction in the Inhabitants of that Country, where that innovation is introduced, and cannot be thought to make the ſoldiery over mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleſome and daring.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102383:26"/>
methods, and carrying on deſigns to allarm <hi>England</hi> in his abſence. I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wiſh your Out-works may be firm and ſtrong, they are likely to be attacked by a formidable power from without, and I do not queſtion but there are attempts formed within to ſecond the ſame, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a manner a common Diſcourſe here: And this I can firmly aſſure your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of, that ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men who were ſome time ago about the Court, and this City are all of a ſudden diſappeared, but have ſince rendevouz'd at <hi>Breſt</hi> with a full deſign to Embark on Board the Fleet, which, whatever Men may flatter themſelves in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with, is very formidable and very near ready to put out to Sea having its full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of Mariners with an additional number of <hi>Landmen,</hi> which are not ſent there without ſome conſiderable deſign in view. I am confident ſome men in <hi>England</hi> would laugh me to ſcorn ſhould I tell them, that the <hi>French</hi> Fleet is compoſed of Fourſcore and two great Men of War, Forty Frigats, Thirty Fireſhips, and Fifteen Gallies; but your Lordſhip, I hope, will have a better Opinion of my Sincerity, than to think I would any ways impoſe upon you.</p>
                  <p>That this formidable Fleet is deſigned for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſt is not doubted, but as to any particular management, all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I could learn is, that an attempt will perhaps be made during the King's being in <hi>Ireland</hi> to raiſe a Mutiny, and that in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102383:27"/>
the Interim, King <hi>James</hi> is to leave the command of his Army to <hi>Lauzun</hi> and <hi>Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connell,</hi> and to haſten with all ſpeed into <hi>England,</hi> to favour which part of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet is to block up the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> another part in conjunction with the Gallies are to land the Men on board, ſomewhere in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and ſuch ſpare Arms as they have with them, which is thought to be a great Number, and when this is done, they are to ſet ſail for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Coaſt to hinder King <hi>William</hi> and his Forces from returning; Now, my Lord, I confeſs I do not think all theſe things pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable, but there muſt be ſomething more than ordinary in the Wind, and you cannot be too cautious.

for his retirement ſo ridiculous, that let them believe it who will, I think I ſhall not yet, and I am ſure your Lordſhip will not; and that is, that Monſieur <hi>Lauzun</hi> had in a manner conſtrained him to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf into <hi>France,</hi> becauſe his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary courage cauſed him to expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf like a common Soldier, even to ſo much danger that it had like to have coſt him his life: And if the foreſaid reaſon was ſo very ridiculous, I am ſure your Lordſhip will not think the rejoycings made in this City upon the groundleſs report of a Lacque of the Kings who got out of <hi>Ireland</hi> a few days after his Maſter, to be leſs ſo; For upon his Arrival, he was pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Court, that Duke <hi>Schomberg</hi> was not only killed, but King <hi>William</hi> dead al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, which good News, as they call it, was of that importance, that it was glibly ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed down, and the proof thereof never enquired into, and the News happening about Mid-night to come into the City, the Commiſſaries immediately ran up and down the Streets, knocking up the People and crying out to them, <hi>Riſe, Riſe, make Bonfires</hi>; So that in about an hours time, all <hi>Paris</hi> was in a Blaze, and nothing to be heard there, but Hautboys, Drums and Trumpets. Not content with this, the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble made the Effigies of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> dragged them through the Dirt and Mire, and at laſt threw them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Flames; The Bells were rung in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102383:28"/>
Pariſhes, the great Guns roared from the <hi>Baſtile</hi>; and in ſhort, for compleating the farce, nothing was omitted, which was uſually done upon the moſt ſolemn occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, neither was this rejoycing confined to the narrow bounds of one day, but laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral: Neither could the publick news from <hi>Holland</hi> and other parts, that expreſly imported the contrary, make them abate one jot of their vain credulity, nay, the queſtioning the truth of it was almoſt a crime unpardonable. And becauſe nothing ſhould be omitted to enforce the belief of it upon all that ſeemed in the leaſt dubious, the Opinions of the learned Phyſicians, who, I muſt tell your Lordſhip did not want practice upon this occaſion, were hotly urged for it, and who for the moſt part mercenarily agreed to reſolve their patient's Queſtions in the affirmative, <hi>viz.</hi> That the wound of a Cannon Bullet was mortal, from whence it was inferred as a natural conſequence, that becauſe King <hi>William</hi> had received ſuch a wound, he muſt of neceſſity be dead of it. Nothing could be more vain and frivolous than to tell them of the number of People that have had their Leggs and their Arms ſhot off by a Cannon Bullet, and yet have lived in a good ſtate of Health for a long time after; for to this it was readily anſwered, That all that was alledged upon that head, was formerly true enough, but that now Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery was quite another thing; and from

that time forward, whoever was but touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Cannon Bullet, though the skin were but only a little raſed, was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to die: Strange is the effect of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, my Lord, and how eaſily do Men believe what they would have to be ſo, but I ſhall not detain your Lordſhip any longer with ſo ridiculous a Narration, though I queſtion not your kind accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of it from</p>

that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for the Confederates, haſtened to give the King an account of it; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two of the Duke's Miniſters were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what confined, but after a little conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the matter, the King thought it adviſable to give his ſubtil Miniſter orders to confer with the ſaid Embaſſadors once more, yet ſo to order it, that it might not look like a formall conference, or a thing concerted before hand; <hi>Croiſſi</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his matters ſo well, that he met them one day in the ſtreet, when he told them, that he wondered he never could ſee them, that Madam <hi>de Croiſſi</hi> had thought they would have come and drink a diſh of Coffee with her, to which purpoſe, he would invite them to his Houſe at ſuch an Hour. The Miniſters to be complaiſant, and being not accuſtomed to deny Ladies ſuch Civilities, willingly accepted his offers, and promiſed to wait upon the Lady at the hour appointed, which they did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſador who had the word given him meet there alſo, but made as if it had been by meer acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. After they had diſcourſed of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things too and fro by the bye, the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Miniſter very dexterouſly turned the diſcourſe into the Battle of <hi>Fleuri,</hi> and the Engagement at Sea againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleets, and ſo took occaſion to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate to the utmoſt of his Eloquence, the advantages which his moſt Chriſtian
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102383:30"/>
Majeſty had reaped thereby, and to leſſen at the ſame time as much as he could the power of the Confederates. From thence paſſing forward to the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> he laboured to ſhew how difficult a task it was for the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to reſiſt the Arms of the moſt Chriſtian King, and laid the chief ſtreſs of his Arguments upon the preſſing deſire which both the Pope and the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> had to prevent the fire of War, from flaming over the Alps, and ſo take hold of all <hi>Italy.</hi> To all which decoying Diſcourſe, Monſieur <hi>de Croiſſi</hi> ſaid no more, but only ſo much as he adjudged neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſhew the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſador ſpoke nothing, but what was true, for fear leaſt the <hi>Savoyards</hi> would have occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the concertſhip between them, and that the <hi>Venetian</hi> ſaid nothing but what the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur put into his Mouth: However, it ſeems the <hi>Savoyards</hi> were not ſo ſtupid, but that they apprehended quickly a good part of the Truth; And therefore being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to engage themſelves in long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes to no purpoſe, they thought it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to anſwer once for all, that the Duke their Maſter had made choice of his ſide, and that no conſideration whatſoever could oblige him to fail in his promiſes to his imperial Majeſty, King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the reſt of the Confederates.

                  <p>NEver were frequenter Conſults held than at this time here, both as to the Sea and Land Affairs, and the King's time is ſo taken up continually with the one or the other of them, that he has of late neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his ordinary Recreations and Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements; I am confident there is a grand deſign formed againſt <hi>England,</hi> and I have

But yet, my Lord, if my intelligence fail not, they have much more reaſon to fear ſuch a match ſtruck up with the Infanta of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> as giving a fair proſpect to far greater future advantages, then any ſolid preſent ones that might reaſonably be expected from that other Allyance with the grand Duke; more eſpecially ſince the Dauphine will have in her right, not only a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar pretention to the Crown of the King her Father, but alſo a very plauſible one to the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſo an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage may be made of both at the ſame time; I wiſh the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were as jealous of this match as they are of their Wifes, then there may be ſome hopes of fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſame.

this Court, eſpecially ſo far as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> in particular, from whence they have juſt received the bad News of the raiſing the Seige of <hi>Coni,</hi> which is yet but whiſpered amongſt them; But your Lordſhip may ſo far rely upon my Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in this particular, as confidently to report it in <hi>England</hi>; of which News, I queſtion not your giving hereby the firſt Intelligence: But though this ill Succeſs is ſo much the more mortifying to this Court, in that they fully reckoned upon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Place, ſeeing all others that had hitherto been beſieged by their Arms on that ſide, have made little or on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and that they own themſelves they have loſt before it Eighteen Hundred of the beſt of their Men; Yet another Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent has, my Lord, this very Day happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, which at preſent ſeems more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, and a greater Subject of Diſcourſe than the other; and that is, the Death of our Grand Miniſter of State, the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois:</hi> Your Lordſhip knows what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation I have ſtood to him in, and what Word I ſent you once by Major <hi>H</hi>— if there was a Poſſibility of his ſeeing you, of my then Circumſtances upon the ſame Foot. Things being ſtill much the ſame, I ſhall not further trouble you with a vain Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of what I am now well aſſured the ſaid Major has reported to your Honour; but obſerve, That the Marqueſs having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Princeſs <hi>d'Eſpenoy</hi> and Madam
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102383:35"/>
                     <hi>de Soubize,</hi> he found himſelf preſently after ill in the King's Chamber, from whence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into his own to be Let Blood; but not finding any Eaſe by Bleeding in one Arm, and being extreamly oppreſſed in his Spirits, nothing would content him but he muſt needs be Let Blood in the other, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon died at the ſame time. Theſe, my Lord, are the naked Circumſtances of this Great Man's Departure; and you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie upon it, though I do not queſtion but many may be apt to aſcribe his Death to ſome extraordinary and violent Cauſe, ſince I have even already heard a Whiſper of it in a Corner: But whatever Reflections the World may make upon the Cauſes of his Death, I foreſee there will be no leſs Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions upon the Train of Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that may attend it. Perhaps many of the Confederates may be apt to believe that the Death of Monſieur <hi>de Louvois</hi> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch an Alteration of Affairs here, as may not a little contribute to the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of theirs, ſince much of the happy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs that has hitherto attended the King's Deſigns, will be aſcribed to the Addreſs, Cunning and Policy of this Miniſter, and that the <hi>French</hi> Lilies will wither in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's hands. I do very well know that ſuch Suggeſtions carry a great Appearance of Truth in them: But if I may freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver my Opinion to your Lordſhip, from my own Obſervation and Experience, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but declare my ſelf contrary to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102383:36"/>
Sentiments, which, if any Ways relyed on, will be found to prove but broken Reeds; For, believe me, my Lord, the <hi>French</hi> King has had a greater Share in the publick Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of his Kingdom, than any of his Miniſters, for all the Time I have known <hi>France</hi>: And no one underſtands his own Affairs and Intereſts as well as himſelf; to ſay nothing of the Aſſiſtance of ſo many politick Perſons, and Men of great Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he has conſtantly about his Perſon, and who ſerve him with more than ordinary Zeal and Affection; which will ſufficiently compenſate for the Loſs of one ſingle Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Your Honour cannot but be ſenſible why I obſerve this at the preſent Juncture, ſuch an Aery Advantage as this is like to prove, can bring no ſolid benefit to my Country, but a real Detriment will infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſucceed a Dependance upon it. But the Death of Monſieur <hi>Barillon,</hi> which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a few Hours before the other, and who knew <hi>England</hi> better than any other <hi>French</hi>-man, may, I truſt, conduce more to the Tranquility of the Kingdom within, which none more paſſionately deſires to hear of, than,</p>

                  <p>WHat I obſerved to your Lordſhip in my laſt, how vain the Hopes of the Confederates were like to prove, of any good Advantage to their Affairs, by the Death of Monſieur <hi>de Louvois,</hi> appears here daily more and more, by divers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that might be given; But I ſhall only confine my ſelf to inform your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that the Advancement of Monſieur <hi>Pompone</hi> to be Prime Miniſter of State, is a clear Demonſtration of the Truth I have advanced, as 'tis of the King's great Skill and Judgment alſo; Though indeed, it muſt be owned, that this new Favourite enters upon his Miniſtry in a tickliſh Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Time; yet for my own part, I am fully ſatisfied Things are not ſo bad with <hi>France,</hi> as the World would believe them to be, and the following Propoſals of Peace, intended to be, or, as ſome ſay, already offered to the Confederates, would inſinuate; of which I communicate to your Lordſhip a Copy, as I have received them from a Friend, with ſome difficulty.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That towards promoting ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ſo good a Work, he is willing to reſtore to His Catholick Majeſty of <hi>Spain</hi> the City of <hi>Mons,</hi> and other Places he has taken from him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the City and Fortreſs of <hi>Philipsburg</hi> ſhall be reſtored by him, to the Biſhop of <hi>Spire,</hi> in the Condition it is now in, without any Alteration what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That he will entirely quit <hi>Strasburg,</hi> and reſtore it to its ancient Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of a Free and Imperial City.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That he will demoliſh all the Fortreſſes he has built along the <hi>Rhine</hi> for ſeveral Years paſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly, and Laſtly,</hi> That the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſhall be reſtored to all the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he has loſt ſince the War; and alſo receive full Satisfaction for all the Loſſes ſuſtained therein.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>But, my Lord, whether any ſuch Offers have been, or are like ſhortly to be offered to the Confederates, by this Court, I am not fully ſatisfied; but of this I am, and deſire your Honour to be ſo too, that

Things are not yet brought to that Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with <hi>France,</hi> whatever ſome Men may be apt to flatter themſelves with, as for her to be truly real and ſincere in ſuch like Offers: Neither, indeed, do I find it believed here at all; and they are much more concerned to break off the Negotiation which is on foot between the Emperor and the Grand Seignior, than they have preſent real Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to accommodate their own immediate Affairs, and be at Peace with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: But what Progreſs they have made to keep their <hi>Mahometan</hi> Friend in their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, I will not take upon me to inform your Lordſhip with any Certainty; I only note, that they begin to talk of it here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready with very great Aſſurance, as a thing at leaſt three quarters done.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102383:38"/>
ſhould increaſe, to the prejudice of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the <hi>German</hi> Potentates, and other Dependants upon the Empire. It does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, That as ſoon as he has Peace with the <hi>Turk,</hi> he will have at leaſt, an Army of Fourſcore Thouſand Men, all compoſed of his own Soldiers, which he will not fail to quarter, by fair or foul Means, upon the Territories of the Electors, other Princes of the Empire, and the Free Cities; And then would ſlily infuſe in the Cloſe, a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour into the <hi>Germans,</hi> of their being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the ſame deplorable Condition as they were in the Year 1628. when they had none but the City of <hi>Stralsburg, &amp;c.</hi> which yet, by the help of the <hi>Swede,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the whole Force of the Emperor <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> II. Your Lordſhip knows the Story full well, I need not relate it; as you do how to make a ſolid Judgment of the Invalidity of theſe Whimwham Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as well as to refute ſuch Cobweb-Arguments. The Second is much of the ſame Stamp, only the Text is taken from the Progreſs of King <hi>William</hi>'s Arms in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> From whence they would fooliſhly infer, as in the former, That his growing thus formidable, foreboded no Good to the Nations round him; (to <hi>France,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it does not;) and that not only <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but <hi>Holland</hi> too, and even the Catholick <hi>Spaniſh Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> ought to look about them; ſince it was very manifeſt he had now formed a

'Tis too impertinent to run through all the vain Repetitions uſed by them, upon this Subject; I ſhall therefore content my ſelf to ſay, in a Word, there is a great deal more of the Ribaldry behind, to the ſame purpoſe, and that I'll trouble your Lordſhip no longer with it; Though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I could meet at this time with no better Entertainment for you; who am yet proud of the Opportunity to caution my Country againſt any Snares laid for its Liberty from hence, and overturning its Settlement by groundleſs and unſeaſonable Jealouſies; as I am always to acknowledge how much I am,</p>

                  <p>IN the Reign of <hi>Duncane,</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who came to the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Crown upon the deceaſe of his Uncle <hi>Milcolm</hi> in the Year 1040. while one <hi>Bancho, Thane</hi> of <hi>Lochquaber</hi> (from whom the <hi>Stuarts</hi> deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) was gathering the King's Revenues, within the bounds of his own Juriſdiction, and withal ſomewhat ſeverely puniſhing ſuch as he found to be notorious Offenders; it cauſed a Mutiny in the Country, and ſo a Conſpiracy was formed againſt <hi>Bancho,</hi> by a parcel of Riotous and Lawleſs Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, who firſt ſpoil'd his Goods, and then aſſaulted his Perſon, giving him
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102383:51"/>
many dangerous Wounds, ſo that he had much ado to eſcape with his Life: But aſſoon as he found himſelf a little reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, and in a condition to travel, he determined to repair to the Court, in order to require Satisfaction for the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages he had ſuſtained; where, after he had made Complaint to the King of the ſame; and of the Indignities that had been offer'd to him, he at length pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd to have an Herald ſent to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, to cite them to make their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Appearance, for to anſwer to ſuch Matters as ſhould be laid to their Charge: But they, inſtead of complying with the Summons, entertain'd the Meſſenger firſt with all manner of Reproaches; and when they had as deſpitefully uſed him, both in Words and Actions, as they could, ſlew him out-right; and ſo entring into a Confederacy with their Friends and Kinsfolks, as expecting to be call'd to a ſevere Account by an Armed Power from the King, they choſe one <hi>Mackdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald</hi> for their Captain, who readily enough embraced the Command, and ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter routed ſome Troops, ſent againſt them, under the Conduct of a Nobleman, whom they took Priſoner, and afterwards ſlew, with which Succeſs they were not a little elated and fluſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:102383:51"/>Hereupon the King call'd a Council, to conſult what to do, among whom, <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> (ſo famed upon the Stage) was one; who exclaiming much againſt the Pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cariouſneſs of the Government, and the miſtaken Lenity of the King towards notorious Offenders, did notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing promiſe, that if they were pleaſed to leave that Affair to his and <hi>Bancho</hi>'s Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, he did not doubt but in a very ſhort time to give a good account of the Rebels: Hereupon he and <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> were joyn'd in Commiſſion to go againſt them, and in ſome time ſet out with a Body of Men towards <hi>Lochquaber</hi>; The fame of whoſe Approach ſtruck the Enemy with ſuch a panick Fear, that they diſperſed in great Numbers, leaving their Captain <hi>Mackdonald</hi> almoſt deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, who notwithſtanding with the ſmall Remains he had left with him, adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly gave them Battle; but being rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he fled for Refuge to an adjacent Caſtle; and finding himſelf environn'd by his Enemies on all ſides, and no way left for his Eſcape, he firſt ſlew his Wife and Children, and then laid violent Hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, to prevent, as he dreaded, a ſeverer Puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>This Rebellion being thus happily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt by the good Conduct and Manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Mackbeth</hi> and <hi>Bancho,</hi> another more dangerous Storm did upon the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102383:52"/>
Neck of it, threaten <hi>Scotland</hi>; for <hi>Sweno,</hi> King of <hi>Norway,</hi> landed at <hi>Fife,</hi> with a puiſſant Army, deſigning no leſs than to make an entire Conqueſt of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Scotland: Duncane,</hi> to obviate as much as might be the Intentions of the Enemy, raiſes Forces with utmoſt Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and next to himſelf entruſted the Command of them with the two afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Chieftains, <hi>Mackbeth</hi> and <hi>Bancho</hi>; who had but a little while before done him ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Service againſt his Rebellious Subjects. Near <hi>Calroſe</hi> the two Armies engaged, and fought for a conſiderable time, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible obſtinacy, but at laſt the <hi>Danes</hi> prevailed, and the <hi>Scots</hi> were totally rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>Duncane</hi> fled to the Caſtle of <hi>Bertha,</hi> which <hi>Sweno</hi> laid cloſe ſiege to forthwith: <hi>Mackbeth</hi> in the mean time rallies and raiſes more Forces, to whom the King, by the Advice of <hi>Bancho,</hi> ſent word, that he ſhould not march to his Relief till he had further Orders: The King in the interim entertains a feigned Treaty of Surrender with <hi>Sweno,</hi> and to elude the Matter yet further, ſent his Army, as a Donative, ſome Proviſions of Ale and Bread out of the Caſtle, but had firſt mixt both with the Juice of Banewort, a noxious Herb; which did ſo intoxicate the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Soldiers, who feaſted greedily thereon, that they generally fell all faſt aſleep; upon which <hi>Mackbeth</hi> had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102383:52"/>
Orders ſent him to march up without delay, and fall upon them, which he did with that ſucceſs, that the whole Army was ſlain, ſave the King, and about ten Men more, who with great difficulty fled to their Ships. But the Rejoycings made for this Victory were ſcarce cold, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Daniſh</hi> Army, ſent by <hi>Canutus,</hi> to the aſſiſtance of <hi>Sweno,</hi> landed at <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn,</hi> which were alſo encountred by <hi>Mackbeth</hi> and <hi>Bancho,</hi> and utterly routed.</p>
                  <p>Some time after this, as <hi>Buchanan, Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius,</hi> and other <hi>Scotch</hi> Writers relate, tho' in a different manner, As <hi>Mackbeth</hi> and <hi>Bancho,</hi> without any other Company, were agoing to a place called <hi>Fores,</hi> where the King then reſided; it fortuned that they met three Women upon the Road of a very ſtrange Aſpect and Habit; one of them ſaluted <hi>Mackbeth, Thane</hi> of <hi>Angus,</hi> another of <hi>Murrey,</hi> and the third King, of <hi>Scotland</hi>; with which kind of Salutation they were both very much ſurpriz'd, and <hi>Bancho</hi> ſaid to the Women, <hi>why ſo unkind to me, as to beſtow nothing upon me, when you have aſſigned to my Companion not only high Preferments, but even the Kingdom of</hi> Scotland: <hi>Nay,</hi> but reply'd the firſt of them, <hi>we have greater Favours in ſtore for thee; he ſhall reign indeed but with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy end, and leave none of his Poſterity to inherit the Crown; but of thee ſhall thoſe be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102383:53"/>
born who ſhall govern the</hi> Scotch <hi>Nation by a long Succeſſion of continued deſcent:</hi> And this I take to be the Ground of Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s ſaying in his <hi>Scotia,</hi> that it was ſtrangely foretold this <hi>Bancho,</hi> above three hundred Years before it began to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd; that he indeed ſhould not be King, but that out of his Loyns ſhould come a Race of Kings, that ſhould for ever rule <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Apparition, for ſo it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards interpreted, made at firſt no great Impreſſions on the Spirits, either of the one or the other, ſo as that they made no other uſe of it than to jear one another ever and anon therewith; <hi>Bancho</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently calling <hi>Mackbeth,</hi> by way of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule, <hi>King of Scotland,</hi> and the other as often entertaining him with the Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Father of many Kings</hi>; till ſuch time, which happened not long after, that the <hi>Thane</hi> of one of the foreſaid places being condemned and executed for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Mackbeth</hi> was bountifully inveſted by the King in all his Lands, Livings and Offices; which being interpreted by him as a favourable Preſage, and as it were a <hi>Praeludium</hi> towards the Accompliſhment of the foreſaid <hi>Prediction</hi> concerning him, it raiſed his Hopes mightily; and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ſet all his Wits on work, and to imploy all his Engines, among whom <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> was chief, who gave him all the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102383:53"/>
he could in his bloody Deſigns, for to attain to the Crown; which not long after, by a barbarous Parricide (for a good King is Father of his Country) he accompliſh'd, having ſlain the King at <hi>Inverneſs,</hi> or (as others write) at <hi>Botgoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vane,</hi> in the ſixth Year of his Reign, and ſo was forthwith crowned at <hi>Scone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mackbeth,</hi> to ingratiate himſelf with the People, without which, no Government, tho' never ſo juſt, can long ſubſiſt, gets ſeveral good and wholſome Laws enacted for the publick Weal; But this was an effect rather of Policy, than any natural Diſpoſition and good Genius in him, as did afterwards appear; and as Tyrants are always uneaſie, he was never without dreadful Apprehenſions that he ſhould be ſerved the ſame ſawce himſelf, as he had done by his Predeceſſor, and the Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on foremention'd did not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute thereunto, eſpecially that part of it that referr'd to the poſterity of <hi>Bancho</hi>'s attaining in time to the poſſeſſion of the Diadem. And as nothing is more terrible to a wicked Uſurper than the Thoughts of a Succeſſor, eſpecially without his own Line; former Confederacies, for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Supream Power, being now diſregarded, and quite effaced with the Cares to ſecure it; for indeed there is but little Faithfulneſs to be expected from Aſſociates in Villany, be their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102383:54"/>
Engagements never ſo ſolemn; he makes it his whole buſineſs to cut off <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> who had been ſo inſtrumental to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance him (the very Practice of <hi>Richard</hi> the III toward <hi>Henry Stafford,</hi> Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>) and therefore, in order to put his projected Deſign in execution, he invites him, together with his Son <hi>Fleance,</hi> to a ſupper, which he had prepared for them. They ſuſpecting no Treachery in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, made no ſcruple to come, and feaſted merrily; and when all was over, prepared to return to their own Lodgings, but they were on their way thither, without the Pallace-Gates, to prevent the ſuſpition of the King's having any Hand in it, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by ſeveral Ruſſians, whom he had hired for that purpoſe, who ſlew the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outright; But the Son, thro' the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the dark Night, happily eſcaped; and being ſenſible of the danger he was in if he ſtay'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> from the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie and Malice of <hi>Mackbeth,</hi> who, he was now fully ſatisfied, had contrived the Murder of his Father, tho' the other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd all he could to ſuppreſs it, and make appear it was only a matter of chance, he fled into <hi>Wales.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He had not been there long, but that he grew into great Favour and Eſteem with <hi>Trahern,</hi> Prince of that part of the Country, call'd <hi>Northwales,</hi> but into far greater Intimacy, and even to an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102383:54"/>
Familiarity with his Daughter, ſo as that ſhe was got with Child by him; which at length coming to the Ears of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was ſo enraged with the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour done to his Family by this Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and ſo ſenſibly touch'd with his Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Rules of Hoſpitality, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs would ſatisfie him than his Blood, and ſo he ſlew him. The Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he alſo ſeverely uſed, who was at laſt brought to Bed of a Son, whom they named <hi>Walter</hi>; who, tho' but meanly Educated by his Grandfather's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, did notwithſtanding prove to be a Perſon of high Reſolution, and expert in Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Walter</hi> having on a time happen'd to fall out with one of his Companions, occaſion'd chiefly by the other's reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, with his illegitimacy, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him Baſtard; he became ſo enraged thereat, that he flew upon him, and ſlew him outright: But bethinking himſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately of what he had done, with the great danger he was in, if he ſtay'd any longer in the Country, he reſolv'd to flee, and make the beſt of his way for <hi>Scotland,</hi> his Father's native Country; where he had not long arrived, but he happen'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Company of ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, come thither to attend Queen <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet,</hi> Wife to <hi>Milcolm,</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Siſter to <hi>Edgar Atheline,</hi> Kinſman, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102383:55"/>
(right Heir to <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor) and behaved himſelf ſo orderly, and with ſuch a winning Converſation, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came highly eſteem'd of them. This by degrees made way for him to attain the King's favour, who entertain'd ſo good an Opinion of him, that when in ſome time after, Tumults and ſome popular Diſorders had happen'd in the parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Galloway,</hi> and the adjacent Iſlands, he thought fit to entruſt him with the Care of that Affair; and <hi>Walter</hi> was ſo ſucceſsful in his Enterprize, that he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppreſs'd the Diſorders, ſlew the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Ringleaders of thoſe Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and reduced that part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into a very good <hi>Decorum</hi> and Order.</p>
                  <p>I do not find the King ever reſtor'd him to the Inheritance of his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bancho,</hi> and the Thaneſhip of <hi>Loch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaber</hi>; but however it was, he was ſo far ſatisfied with his Conduct, and ſo fully ſenſible of the Service he had done him, that he beſtowed a new Dignity upon him, which was that of Steward of <hi>Scotland.</hi> This was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> term, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> frequenting that Kingdom ſo much at that time, by reaſon of their Concourſe to, and Attendance upon Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> together with ſome other concurring Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, might be the occaſion of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of it. It was no doubt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable power he was entruſted with,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102383:55"/>
by virtue of this new Office, but I do not think it much different, as to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, but only in reſpect to its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, from that of <hi>Thane</hi>; which Term and Office annext to it, becauſe ſo often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd already, and may perhaps more hereafter, I ſhall endeavour a little to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate, and I hope the Reader will think it no impertinent Digreſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thane</hi> therefore is derived by ſome from the old <hi>Saxon</hi> word <hi>Thegn,</hi> which cometh of <hi>Thenian,</hi> i. e. <hi>Miniſtrare alicui,</hi> and made to ſignifie ſometime a Nobleman, ſometime a Freeman; another while a Magiſtrate, and ſometime an Officer or Miniſter; thus Mr. <hi>Lambert,</hi> in his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of <hi>Saxon</hi> Words, interprets it; <hi>Vavaſour</hi>'s Explication of it, is much to the ſame purpoſe; but <hi>Skene de verborum Significatione,</hi> ſaith, that it is the name of a Dignity, and appears to be equal with the Son of an Earl; and that <hi>Thanus</hi> was a Freeholder, holding his Lands of the King; hence <hi>Thanagium Regis</hi> ſignified a certain part of the King's, or property, whereof the Rule and Government appertain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>King <hi>Robert,</hi> had now Governed by his Governour, for the ſpace of Light Years, when a Parliament was held at <hi>Perth</hi>; wherein to manifeſt his Favour, he made his Eldeſt Son <hi>David,</hi> who was then Eighteen Years of Age, Duke of <hi>Rothſay,</hi> and his Brother the Governour, Duke of <hi>Albany</hi>; Virgin Titles, that till this time had been unknown in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan,</hi>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102383:64"/>
and therefore ſeveral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints were prefered againſt him to his Father; who at laſt perceiving it beyond his power to reſtrain thoſe exorbitant Courſes, and that ſuch violations would unavoidably bring both Father and Son to utmoſt Contempt, and might have a very bad Conſequence to attend them; he Writes to his Brother the Governour, and now Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> to take the young Man into his own governance and keeping, till ſuch time and in expectation he ſhould be reclaimed and brought to a better tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. This was that which the Governour for a long time had lacked, as thinking if he were once taken out of the way, his paſſage to the Crown might in time be made ſmooth and eaſie (and therefore leaves no ſtone unturned to get him into his bloody Clutches) at laſt he contrived the matter ſo, that he ſeized him upon the Road near St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s, and conveyed him to the Caſtle of the ſaid place, which he had taken into his own hands upon the death of the Biſhop a little before, under pretence of ſecuring of it; and in a ſhort time after removed him thence, into his own Caſtle of <hi>Falkland,</hi> making him there a cloſe Priſoner: And now reſolved he was to be rid of him, and he could think of no method more expedient to effect his deviliſh deſign than by ſtarving of him; But that life which the barbarous cruelty
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102383:65"/>
of the Unkle had deſtined for a moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable death, the compaſſion of two young Women prolonged for a time: One of them was daughter to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Caſtle, and who had the charge of the young Duke, who as often as ſhe had an opportunity to go into the Gardens adjacent to the Caſtle, did put into him ſome oaten Cake folded up in a Vail which ſhe careleſly wore on her head to keep off the Sun, through a ſmall chink rather than a Window: The other was a poor Nurſe, who through a long Read fed him with the Milk from her own Breaſts. When the young Man's Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as his Life had by this hard ſhift been for ſome days prolonged, which rather ſerved for the increaſing than allaying of his hunger; the Women were at laſt diſcovered by the Spies they had every where about them, and were both villanouſly put to death, the Father ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much unhumane cruelty towards his daughter, as ſhe had ſhewn mercy to his Royal Priſoner, bitterly curſing her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy (as he called it) as endeavouring thereby to ſhew himſelf faithful to a faithleſs Brother, Unkle and Governour. The young Man being thus deprived of all humane relief, was conſtrain'd through the violence of hunger, not only to eat all ſuch filth as he could find within his Priſon, but at laſt to ſet upon his own
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102383:65"/>
fleſh, and to gnaw off his own Fingers, and ſo ended his wretched life, and died, as I may ſay a double Death: This bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous act needs no Comment, it beſpeaks Villany to the height in every part of it.</p>
                  <p>Some time elapſed before this dreadful news of the Prince's death came to the Ears of the King, none adventuring to be the ſad Meſſenger unto him, of that which almoſt all knew off; but when he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed of it, and had alſo ſome ſecret intimations given him, his Brother had had a deep, if not the ſole hand in it (for none durſt accuſe ſo great a Man openly) he grew very ſad and melancholy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; and the rather, in that he had not power to take Vengeance upon him, for the perpetrating of ſo barbarous a deed, and for doing him ſo unretrievable an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury: However to make ſome ſemblance of Kingly Authority, he ſends for the Duke his Brother to come to him, at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to expoſtulate with him about the fact. The Duke who knew the purport of the meſſage as well as himſelf, frames a fair and ſpecious ſtory to excuſe himſelf, as tho he were as innocent of the fact as the Child Unborn; And for a farther proof of it, urges his care to ſeek out the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrators of that horrid deed, and that he had now at length made ſo far a progreſs in the matter; that he did not doubt but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102383:66"/>
if the King would be pleaſed to come to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> he ſhould be able to bring in all the Offenders. The King who was then at a place called <hi>Bute,</hi> where for the moſt part he ever reſided, tho he was very unfit to travel upon many accounts, and eſpecially by reaſon of a tedious fit of ſickneſs he had laboured under; yet ſo great and eager a deſire he had to ſee his Son's death puniſhed, that he made a hard ſhift to get in a Chariot into <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> When he was come thither, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour convenes the Council, and orders the parties accuſed to be brought before them the King himſelf being alſo preſent. The Accuſers, as the Duke (who was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the guilty perſon, had before contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it) ſtoutly charge them with the fact. The King after he had imprecated Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance from Heaven, and the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Curſes upon them and their Poſterity, who had perpetrated ſo horrid an act, being over-preſt with ſorrow and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of Body, returns to <hi>Bute,</hi> from whence he came. The Duke that he might colour the matter as much as might be, brings the ſuppoſed Criminals to their Tryals, and by corrupt Judges (ſuch as the Duke had provided for that purpoſe) were Condemned as guilty of his Murder, whom in all their life time they had never ſeen.</p>

But foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he well knew that the Duke had all the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> under his Obeiſance, partly by Policy, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by virtue of his Office of Governour, he durſt not ſhew his reſentment, nor attempt to call him to an account for it; but was rather afraid on the other hand, leſt having ambitious Deſires to poſſeſs himſelf of the Crown, he would alſo make it his Buſineſs to procure the death of his ſecond Son <hi>James,</hi> and by that means take off the only Rub in his way. The King, I ſay, being thus ſollicitous in Mind about ſecuring that to his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which his unnatural Brother was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to deprive them of, conſults with <hi>Walter Wardlaw,</hi> Arch-biſhop of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> about his Son's Security.

thirty Perſons beſides. But he was ſo ſtraitned by the King's Arms, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued ſo cloſe, that he was forced to flee into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſoon after died there an exile. The ſame Year the King call'd a Parliament at <hi>Sterling,</hi> whereing <hi>Mordo,</hi> with his two Sons, <hi>Walter</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Duncan Stuart,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi> (four of them at one clap) were convicted of High-Treaſon, and the two Sons the very ſame day were beheaded in the open place, before the Caſtle, and next Morning Duke <hi>Mordo</hi> and <hi>Lenox</hi> run the ſame Fate in the ſame place: It's a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Fame (ſaith <hi>Buchanan,</hi> tho' I find it written no where) that the <hi>King</hi> ſent the Heads of the Father, Husband and Children, to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> Wife to the ſaid <hi>Mordo,</hi> his Couſin-Germane; to try (a barbarous Practiſe) whether ſhe who was known to be a fierce Woman, would (as moſtly it happens) through exceſs of Grief, diſcover the Secreſie of her Mind upon ſuch an occaſion: But ſhe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that grievous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd for Spectacle, did not inordinately break forth into any bitter Words, but only ſaid with a calm Temper, <hi>If the faults were true which have been laid to their Charge, the King had done nothing but what is Right and Juſt unto them.</hi> As this <hi>King</hi>'s Reign was uſher'd in with the foreſaid Troubles, it continued to be in a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102383:71"/>
upon other Accounts, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly for the great Penſion raiſed for his Ranſom, and for raiſing of other Moneys; which tho' the Revenues were exhauſted, was interpreted Covetouſneſs in him. But in the thirteenth and laſt Year of his Reign a ſharp Rencounter happening between <hi>Henry Percy</hi> and <hi>William Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas,</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> at a place call'd <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perden,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland; James</hi> thinking himſelf injured hereby by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as the <hi>Scotch</hi> Hiſtorians write, but <hi>Hall</hi> and <hi>Graſton</hi> charge him home with Ungratitude herein, raiſes a great Army, and lays Siege to the Caſtle of <hi>Roxbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>; but when, as the <hi>Scotch</hi> write, he had almoſt brought his Work to Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that the beſieged began to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate about ſurrendring of the place, the Queen in all haſte came to the Camp; and acquainted him there was a horrid Conſpiracy framed againſt his Life, and conjured him to uſe all the Precautions imaginable to ſecure himſelf. The King was ſurprized with the Meſſage, he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with raiſed the Siege, and returned home, to provide for his better ſafety, tho' all avail'd little.</p>
                  <p>But that you may have a clearer Idea of the whole Matter, we muſt a little look back, and tell you again that <hi>Robert</hi> II. had three Sons by his Concubine, whom he afterward married, and ſo ſettled the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102383:71"/>
Crown upon them, to the Excluſion of his two legitimate Sons by his Queen <hi>Euphemia Roſs,</hi> who were <hi>Walter,</hi> Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> Earl of <hi>Strathern:</hi> Now theſe two, tho' they found themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by ſuch a Preference of an ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate Race before them; Yet being inferiour, both in Years and Wealth, they diſſembled their Reſentment for the preſent: The Death alſo of the Earl of <hi>Strathern</hi> weakned their Hands, who left one only Daughter behind him, who was given in Marriage to <hi>Patrick Graham,</hi> a noble Youth, and a moſt potent and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Family as any in that Age; on whom he begat <hi>Meliſſe Graham,</hi> whoſe Parents did not long ſurvive: And the Child not many Years after, being then a Stripling, was ſent into <hi>England</hi> among thoſe who were Hoſtages till the Money for the Kings Ranſom were diſcharg'd and paid. But <hi>Atholl,</hi> tho' he were every ways inferior to the oppoſite Faction, yet ever made it his Buſineſs to take off his Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and did not lay aſide his Hopes of recovering the Crown; and becauſe he was not capable of doing any thing by open force, he craftily ſowed Diſcord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and ſo plied the Matter, that, as has been already in ſome meaſure ſet forth, a very numerous Family were re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duced to a few, for the moſt part, by his Council. For many were of Opinion,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102383:72"/>
that it it was by his Contrivance that <hi>David,</hi> Duke of <hi>Rothſay,</hi> King <hi>Robert</hi>'s Son, was cut off, neither had <hi>James</hi> eſcap'd his Snares, unleſs he had ſpent the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of his Life in <hi>England,</hi> far from his reach: He would have encouraged the Earl of <hi>Fife</hi> to ſeiſe upon the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, taxing his Brother with Slothfulneſs, and fit to be taken off; and when the King, having now no Children to ſucceed him (for <hi>James</hi> was then a Priſoner in <hi>England</hi>) and obnoxious to the Pleaſure of his Brother, had ſuddenly died of Grief, there was only the Governor now and his Children, that impeded his Hopes. But when <hi>Robert,</hi> the Governor was dead, and his Son <hi>John</hi> kill'd at the Battle of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nole</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> he re-aſſumed his former Thoughts with greater Vigour, and ſtrain'd all his Wits to compaſs the ſame; firſt, by getting of King <hi>James</hi> releaſed, and then contriving Duke <hi>Mordo</hi>'s and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's Death; and ſince it was almoſt inconſiſtent that all theſe ſhould ſubſiſt and be ſafe together, he foreſaw that which ſoever fell of them; he was one degree nearer to the Crown: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>James</hi> was at laſt return'd to his Country, he ſet all his Engines on work to haſten <hi>Mordo</hi>'s death, finds out fit tools to bear Teſtimony againſt him, and ſet himſelf as Judge upon him and his Children; and when they alſo were cut
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102383:72"/>
off, there was only King <hi>James</hi> and a young Son of ſix Years old, that ſtood in the way; and when he by a conjuration of the Nobility were once removed, the Earl did not doubt but himſelf who was the only ſurviving Perſon of the Royal Stem, ſhould be advanced to the Throne. <hi>Atholl</hi> therefore, I ſay, being night and day agitated with ſuch Conſiderations, did however keep all his Deſigns cloſe and ſecret; and thro' a counterfeit Zeal for the King's Welfare, made it his Buſineſs to cut off his Relations and Friends; and more eſpecially to advance his own Eſtate by the Misfortune and Crimes of other Men, and ſo to leſſen his Adverſaries. In the mean time, King <hi>James,</hi> to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his own Misfortune, deprived <hi>Meliſſe Graham,</hi> (who we have ſaid was one of the Hoſtages in <hi>England</hi>) of the Earldom of <hi>Strathern,</hi> alledging it was beſtowed on his Grandfather of the maternal ſide, and his Maſculine Line; and for want of ſuch Iſſue, to revert to the Crown: The Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of the young Man induced many to commiſerate his Caſe, but made <hi>Robert</hi> his Guardian almoſt ſtark mad; and ſo being more impatient of the Injury of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to his Kinſman, ſtuck not to accuſe the King openly of unjuſtice; and being ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to appear, to make his defence, but did not, a Sentence of Baniſhment paſs'd againſt him: This did but enrage him more
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102383:73"/>
and more, and his whole Buſineſs ſeem'd to be to engage others, who had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd in their own Perſons or Friends, to entertain the ſame Sentiments of the King, in reſpect to his Avarice and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty as he had done; but it had been well if he had reſted here.</p>
                  <p>You have heard before, how the King was advertiſed of a Conſpiracy againſt him at <hi>Roxborough,</hi> and how the King, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate the ſame, retired home, and took up his Lodgings in the Convent of the <hi>Dominicans</hi> at <hi>Perth,</hi> and what Deſigns <hi>Walter,</hi> Earl of <hi>Atholl,</hi> had been hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from time to time. Now this <hi>Walter,</hi> the King's Uncle, tho' he were <hi>Principall</hi> Author and Contriver of the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, yet he did his utmoſt endeavour to put off all manner of Suſpition of it from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; therefore he privily ſends for, and diſcourſes with <hi>Robert Graham,</hi> afore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; who, as being an active, bold, raſh Man, and an hater of the King, upon account of his own Impriſonment and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He inſtructs them what they were to do, aſſured them of his favour, when the Fact was perpetrated,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102383:73"/>
not doubting but himſelf ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Throne. Having thus agreed and reſolved upon their helliſh Deſign, they advance ſecretly with their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices, whom they had drawn into the Conſpiracy towards the Friers afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, where the King then reſided, and encourag'd the King's Porter, whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had brought over to their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to give them un-interrupted admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; which he does, and they advanced into the Gallery, adjacent to the King's Bed-Chamber, where he ſhews them the Door might be eaſily forced open, he himſelf having taken away the Bolt: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers think it was <hi>Robert Stuart</hi> aforeſaid, <hi>Atholl</hi>'s Grandſon, that let them into the Court; however it was, while they in the mean time tarried in the Gallery, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing to deliberate about the breaking the Door open, an Accident made their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage the more eaſie; for <hi>Walter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such of the Servants as were there, and made Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, they diſpatch forthwith, and then advanced towards the King, and fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: The Queen did all ſhe could to defend him, and receiv'd two Wounds, and thereby was forced to give over the Conflict; and ſo at laſt, the <hi>King</hi> having received to the number of eight and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Wounds, and ſome of them to the Heart, was ſlain by them. Thus fell <hi>James</hi> the I. <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by violent and bloody Hands, and ſeem'd to entail a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Death upon all of his Name that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him; but becauſe the Execution of ſome of the Conſpirators was the moſt terrible that can be met with in Hiſtory, we ſhall ſhall give you a ſhort Account of it, and the rather, becauſe of the Perſons concern'd therein.</p>
                  <p>The Nobles of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> hearing this unexpected News, aſſembled from all parts of the Nation to <hi>Edinburg,</hi> and made ſuch diligent Search after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, that they were ſoon apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Tried and Condemn'd. <hi>Walter Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art,</hi> Earl of <hi>Atholl,</hi> was charged, as being
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102383:74"/>
principal Actor in this Tragedy, his crime exaggerated to the height, and was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in this tremendous manner. On the firſt day, being ſtripped of all his cloaths, ſave only his ſhirt only, he was bound faſt in a Cart to an Inſtrument of wood made like to a ſwipe, with Ropes and Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to the ſame, by which means they ſometimes raiſed him up on high into the Air that the people might ſee him, and by ſlackning of the Rope all of a ſudden, let him down with a ſwang diſ-jointing all his body thereby; then they brought him to an open place, where all might be Spectators and Crowned him with a red hot Crown of Iron, with this Elogium that he might be Stiled the Ring of all Traytors. The reaſon of this part of the puniſhment was ſaid to be this; for that a Witch had told him that he ſhould be Crowned with great Pomp and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence in the preſence of the people, and that the prediction was in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner either fullfilled or eluded. On the ſecond day he was drawn on a hurdle through the high Street of <hi>Edenburg</hi> at an Horſes tail; he was on the third day extended upon a board at the Market-Croſs, his Belly ripped up and his Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els taken out, thrown into the fire and burnt before his face; then was his heart plucked out and burnt likewiſe, and laſt of all his head was chopp'd off and fixed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102383:75"/>
upon a long Pole and ſet upon the higheſt place of the City, his body divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to four Quarters and ſent to the four principal Cities of the Kingdom. The Execution of <hi>Robert Stuart</hi> was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo ſevere as that of his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, ſome reſpect being had to his youth: But as for <hi>Robert Graham,</hi> who (as did appear) was the Perſon that ſlew the King with his own hands, he was put into a Cart and that hand that did the deed, faſtned to a pair of Gallows that was ſet up in the ſaid Cart; then were three perſons appointed to thruſt him through all parts of his body with hot Irons, beginning firſt with thoſe places where it was thought no haſty Death would enſue, as with his Legs, Arms, Thighs and Shoulders, and thus was he carried through all the Streets of the City and tormented in a moſt horrible manner, and at laſt his Belly ript open, Bowelled and Quartered as <hi>Atholl</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and thus was the cruel Death of King <hi>James</hi> revenged in the moſt cruel manner that was ever heard off, beyond all the Bounds of Humanity.</p>

his Son <hi>James,</hi> the ſecond of that Name, a Minor of about ſix years old; And as the King was not yet able to Govern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, another muſt be choſen, to Govern both him and the Kingdom; and this fell to Sir <hi>Alexander Levinſton</hi> and Sir <hi>William Creichton</hi> the Chancellor; the former had the denomination of the Governour, and the other had the Kings keeping.

He perceiving the danger, had no other way left but to ſend to the Earl of <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs</hi> for his Aſſiſtance. <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> diſdains them both and would not be concerned: The Chancellor ſeeing this, agrees with the Governor, and he was ſtill to keep the Caſtle and his Chancellorſhip.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102383:76"/>
the Governor was abſent at <hi>Perth.</hi> He found the <hi>King</hi> with a very ſmall retinue and ſaluted him very dutifully, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in ſome ſurprize at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he exhorted him in a few words as the time would permit, to be of good cheer and fear nothing, that they were come to deliver him from his Captivity; that he might be no longer under the Government of another, but take the Adminiſtration into his own hands and much to the ſame purpoſe. All which the King received with a pleaſant aſpect; either becauſe the motion pleaſed him as deſirous to Rule, or to diſſemble the fear he had of the Chancellor, and ſo went with him to <hi>Edenburg.</hi> The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor upon his return, was horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſurprized at the News, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now unable to remedy the matter, by the means of friends, he and the Chancellor came to an Accommodation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and the reſult was, that the Governor ſhould ſtill continue in his Office, and the King remain in the keeping of the Chancellor, as at firſt: So that the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom before tendred to him, and with which he ſeem'd to be well pleas'd, was now but a meer illuſion, being as much a Captive as ever.</p>

                  <p>This Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> was Succeeded in his Eſtate and Honours by his Unkle <hi>James Dowglaſs</hi> Baron of <hi>Abercorn</hi>; who is Succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Son <hi>William</hi>; who to prevent the diviſion of the Inheritance, Married the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Siſter of the laſt <hi>William</hi> Beheaded, who was Stiled the fair Maid of <hi>Gallaway.</hi> This Earl flouriſhing in Eſtate and Honours, and finding the King take the Adminiſtration of the Government upon himſelf, came to <hi>Sterling,</hi> and in a ſhort time grew into high Favour with him; inſomuch, that through his perſwaſion, the Chancellor and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor were not only diſcharged from their Offices, but put out of the Council, and their Friends baniſhed the Court, and themſelves Summoned to appear before the King, and upon default proclaimed Rebels; ſo that now the Tables are quite turn'd. <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> Rules all, and the King ſuffers minority under him in his Juſt Age, as he really did under the others during his nonage; himſelf and his Kindred and Friends poſſeſſing all places of profit and Preferment in the Kingdom.

                     <hi>James</hi> III.

He was on a time, it ſeems, informed by ſome Sycophant or other, that his kindred laid in wait for

his life, and that he was in great danger; which agreeing with the ſayings of the Witches which he had Conſulted, and who had told him, that the Lyon ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by his Whelps, it made very deep impreſſions upon his ſuſpicions mind, and ſo from a Prince at firſt very hopefull, and of great expe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And as they had thus barbarouſly murdered his Perſon they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded alſo to murder the Earls fame, for they gave out that his Crime was, that he had had Secret Conſultation with Witches, about deſtroying the King, and to put as good a Colour as they could upon this unnatural Act, tho' it were by heaping up iniquity upon ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, they brought ſeveral other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Sorcerers to their Tryal for the ſaid Fact, and burnt them at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> for the ſame.

he had none to communicate his deſign to, or to further him in it, but one only Servant of his own that was left to be with him in his Chamber; him he ſent to get a Ship ready to attend him at the next Part, at the time appointed which he does effectually: In the mean time his perſecutors to Plague him the more with their deluſions, ſent ſeveral Meſſengers from the Court, who feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the preſence of his Keepers (for he was not allowed to talk with any privately) that the King's Anger began to be pacified, and that he might ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope for his Liberty; but when the day appointed for his eſcape was come; he puts as good a meen as poſſible he could upon the matter, and begins to feign a belief in what the Meſſengers ſaid in Favour of him, and Queſtioned not but to have a ſpeedy and honourable deliverance: And to further the Deſign, treats his Keepers with a ſplendid Supper, and Drinks with them till it was late at night; but when they were gone and faſt aſleep, he falls to work, and makes a Rope of the Sheets of his Bed, long enough as he thought to reach the ground; and firſt for to make a Tryal therof, lets down his Man by it, by whole fall he finds it was ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then it ſhould have been.

In the mean time, while theſe things were in Agitation, comes a Rumour into the Court, that the Nobles held a Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation together before day in the Church, the ſubject whereof was uncertain, but that it muſt be ſtrange that ſuch Men ſhould Aſſemble together without the King and his Councellors Knowledge: The King hereupon being haſtily awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of his ſleep, enquires of thoſe about him, what he had beſt to do; in the mean time he ſends <hi>Cockram</hi> before to obſerve what was done, and to give him an Account of all with ſpeed; he with a few followers goes towards the Church, and meets the cheif of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility advancing towards the Court, whom they no ſooner eſpied, but <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> laid hands on him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and catching hold of a large Gold Chain he had about his neck,

ſqueezed him firſt a little and then ſends him to Priſon, himſelf with the reſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directly to the King's Bed-Chamber: Where, when they came, they filled all with Aſtoniſhment, ſo as that there ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a little pauſe upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the preſent, but it was not long e're they ſeized upon the Kings Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors that were about him, and ſent them all away ſave only <hi>John Ramſey,</hi> a very young man that clung to the King, and who intreated for him that he might be ſpared. The reſt were lead to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and with the loud cries of the Army calling for Juſtice upon thoſe miſcreants, were hanged out of the way; and ſuch forwardneſs was ſhewed to have them diſpatched ſpeedily, that when they wanted Ropes upon ſuch a ſudden oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion every one was ready to offer his Horſes Halter or the Reins of his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle for that purpoſe. Theſe Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were charged with many private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and among the more publick ones was, their adviſing the King to Coin baſe Copper Money, which the Common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by way of reproach, called <hi>Black-Money,</hi> and that this was the principal cauſe of the ſcarcity that was in the Land, the want of Trade, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Calamities too long to be incerted.

remov'd the Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> and ſo ſets the King and all his Servants at liberty; for which extraordinary favour, the King ſhewed him great tokens of his affections, but they were not long-lived; for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of old offences are of greater force in a degenerous and impotent mind than freſh kindneſſes. And to foment his jealouſies, he had always thoſe at his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, who never ceaſed to upbraid the Duke to him, of affecting too much po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity, and to conſtrue the ſame as an infallible ſign of his intentions to ſnatch at the Crown when ever a fit opportunity preſented. The Duke, who was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of thoſe jealouſies, entertained of him, and at laſt finding there was a deſign formed againſt him, of no leſs than tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away his Life, and that (as appeared) by poyſon, withdraws privily into <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> Caſtle: And the King, as conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of his evil doings, fearing the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Nobles, hereupon withdraws alſo into the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburg</hi>; where the Earls of <hi>Angus, Buchan</hi> and others forſook him, and aſſiſted the Duke; But the King being haunted ſtill by his Evil Spirits (I mean) thoſe vile fellows, whom he had again placed about his Perſon, he ſummoned the Duke and his adherents, to appear and anſwer for ſuch treaſonable Crimes as he had to lay to their Charge; and withall prepared an Army to Beſiege

So that here is two of them gone, the fate of the third is now approaching, with winged haſt; For the King having once got a Peace with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the Caſtle of <hi>Dunbar</hi> into his hands, which ſeemed for ſome time to put a check up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his exorbitance, he returns to his old haunts, gives himſelf over not only to be guided by Favourites and mean Perſons as before, who were his Leeches to drain his Subjects, to ſatiate his covetous deſires, but to unlawful pleaſure with looſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: Among the men Favourites <hi>John Ramſey</hi> ſaved (as you have heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) by the Kings importunity from an Halter, was chief: This Man having been advanced to the dignity of Lord Stuard <hi>K</hi> of the ing's Houshold, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with many large demeſns, became ſo elated in mind, that not being content

with that large fortune, nothing would ſerve, but he muſt have an order that none beſides himſelf and his Companions ſhould go armed in thoſe places where the King reſided, deſigning by this deviſe to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie himſelf and his Faction againſt the Nobility of the Kingdom, whom he found to go frequently armed themſelves, and accompanied with ſuch as were well provided for their defence: But this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict procured him more hatred, than it wrought fear in his Enemies. In the mean time the King minded nothing as much as to gratifie his mind with the blood of thoſe, who were thought to be the Authors of Rebellion: And ſeeing he could not bring about his purpoſes, he endeavours to ſurpriſe them by cunning, for feigning to be reconciled to one of them after another, he entertained them with that gentleneſs, and in ſo ſoothing a manner as came below the Dignity of a Prince to do. Others of them who excelled in Riches and Power, he accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with Rewards and Honours, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>David Lindſey</hi> Earl <hi>Crawford,</hi> Duke of <hi>Montroſs</hi>; and <hi>George</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> he would have frequently in his Company, carrying it ſo, by communicating his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Counſels unto him, as if he were throuhgly reconciled.

his Sincerity; for they who knew his diſpoſition doubted not but all that ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Goodneſs and Favour tended to no other end than either to ſurpriſe them, one after another, or to ſet them at variance one againſt another, which when he had got the chief of Nobility to <hi>Edenburg</hi> did more clearly appear; for having ſent for <hi>Dowg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs</hi> to him into the Caſtle, he ſhewed him what a brave opportunity he now had to be revenged on them, for if he did but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Heads of the Factions and puniſh them, the reſt would be quiet: That if he lett his opportunity that preſented it ſelf, ſlip, he could never afterward hope for ſuch another. <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> who well knew that the Kings mind was as implacable towards him as the reſt of them, cunningly diſcuſſes that raſh and evil Counſel; arguing with him, what a baſe and flagitious offence all the world would look upon it to be, if he ſhould without due Proceſs of Law, ſuddenly hale to execution ſo many Illuſtrious Perſons, to whom he was reconciled, as having given his Royal Word for pardoning of what was paſt, and that not long ſince, and now ſecur'd with the Publick Faith; for the fierce and enraged minds of Enemies, would not be broken with the ruine of a few, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once to deſpair of Pardon, they would turn their wrath into fury, and the conſequence of that would be, that they would grow more ſtobborn and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate,

The King believing the Earl ſpoke what he thought (for he knew well enough, that he was able to perform what he promiſed) he gave him many thanks for his adviſe, and diſmiſſed him laden with large Promiſes of Reward. The Earl having warned the Peers to take care of their ſafety, and to withdraw from the imminent danger that hung over their Heads, does himſelf alſo retire to a place of ſafety.</p>
                  <p>The King from hence forwards finding his ſecret Counſels laid open, and not daring to truſt any body, betook himſelf to the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburg</hi>; and from thence being conveyed by Sea to the Countries beyond the <hi>Forth,</hi> which ſtill were obedient to him, did in a ſhort time levy a good Army. And now the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,

who before deſigned nothing, but that the King ſhould amend in his male adminiſtration, finding all accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him deſperate, and his evil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition incurable, bend all their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to remove him. A bad Steward (its moſt certain) he had been, and now they are reſolved to call him to a ſevere account for the ſame. The great difficulty that ſtood in their way, and, which they were deliberating to remove, was, whom they ſhould appoint to be their Captain, who when the King were brought to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, might be conſtituted Vicegerent of the Kingdom: It was adjudged high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary it ſhould be a perſon, that was pleaſing to the Commonallity, of an Illuſtrious Name, That the Faction might not be oppreſt and weakned out of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to his Greatneſs; and at laſt after they had thought of one and another, they pitched unanimouſly upon the King's own Son, the Prince of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who being taken from his Keepers and Governours of his tender years, was urged to a ſpeedy compliance, for if otherwiſe, they were reſolved to transfer the Kingdom into the hands of the King of <hi>England,</hi> who would take care to root out him and his Family for the better ſecurity of it. Now the King had paſt over the <hi>Forth,</hi> and pitched his Tents at a place called <hi>Blackneſs,</hi> and the Sons Army, ready prepared to give

But the agreement as being between ſuch as had an incurable jealouſie of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, did not laſt long: In the mean time Couriers and Mediators paſt continually from one to another, at laſt the Lords gave determinate anſwer; That ſeeing the King acted nothing ſincerely with an intention to perform, they adjudged it better to be engaged in a certain War than a deluſive and treacherous Peace; That the only hopes of agreement was if the King would Abdicate the Throne, and have his Son advanced in his room; if not, it would be to no purpoſe for them to try and fruſtrate one another with Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: The King not to be wanting to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this deſperate Fortune, orders his Embaſſadors in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> to communicate this anſwer to thoſe Kings, whom he earneſtly ſollicites to make uſe of their Authority, or if need were, their Forces too in his behalf, for the repreſſing of the inſolence of a few Rebels, and reduce them to Reaſon and their Duty, and to eſteem his Fortune common with their to own, and ſuch as might by the Contagion thereof

The Pope having one <hi>Adrian Caſtlean</hi> for his Legate in <hi>England,</hi> a Man of great Learning and Prudence, he Writes to him to uſe his endeavour to compoſe the <hi>Scotch</hi> Affairs, and bring them to a ſettlement. But this came a day after the fare; for the Lords who knew well enough that theſe proceedings of the King abroad were in agitation, and withall that his mind was implacable towards them, reſolved, before he ſhould have an opportunity to augment the number of his Forces, to try it out by Arms; and though they had the Kings Son with them, as well to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt their Authority to the Common People, as to ſhew that they were not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with or had no quarrel againſt their Country, but a pernicious King, who would have ruined them; yet leaſt the minds of the people ſhould be alienated by the cunning or forreign Ambaſſadors and other accidents that attend procra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, they were buſied night and day how to commit all to the hazard of a Battle: But the Kings timerouſneſs was
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102383:89"/>
an obſtacle to their eagerneſs and haſt, who becauſe he had ordered conſiderable Levies to be made, for the augmentation of the Troops he had on foot already, in the northern parts of the Kingdom, did in the mean time keep himſelf cloſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburg</hi>: But that he might precipitate his fate, he was brought by his Followers, whether deſignedly or ignorantly is uncertain, to forſake this wholſome Counſel which he looked upon to be ſafeſt for him; for they perſwaded him, that by reaſon of the frequent tides there, which might cauſe delay and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to them that were about to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; it were more adviſeable he ſhould go to <hi>Sterling</hi> Caſtle, the beſt ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated place of any, for gathering of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces together out of all parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: That he would be as ſafe there as in <hi>Edenburg</hi> Caſtle, ſeeing his Enemies were unprepared of all things neceſſary for a Siege, That his Fleet alſo which he had prepared to be an help to him at all adventures, might be at hand: This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice did indeed ſeem to be ſound and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and had been ſafe enough in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the event, had it not been that the Governour of the Caſtle being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the oppoſite Faction, excluded him from admittance: And now all things conſpire to his ruin, for the Lords were now at his heels, that he could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102383:92"/>
Daughter, and laſtly a Peace between both Kings during their Lives. This Kings Reign is remarkable upon many accounts, which being not the ſcope of this Treatiſe, we deſignedly omit: But one paſſage I meet with in <hi>Leſley</hi>'s Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Kingdom, which for the rarity of it I cannot omit, and hope the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will not think it an Impertinent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. About this time, ſays the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Author, The King (to tell you a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs that to this day is remembred with great Laughter among the <hi>Roman</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) created a certain <hi>Italian,</hi> with whoſe Wit and Pleaſant Converſation he was much taken, Abbot of <hi>Tungland</hi>; This man, thinking to magnifie his own parts, did on a certain time perſwade the King, that he was ſo well skilled in the Secrets of Nature and more eſpecially in the noble Science of Chimiſtry, that he could tranſmute any other Metal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gold, if the King would pleaſe to bear the Charges thereof; But after much Time and Treaſure ſpent, and long Expectation of this Glorious Effect, all proved Abortive, and came to nothing; ſo that the vain Braccadocio fell into great contempt both by the King and People, which grieved him very ſore; ſo that he ſets all his Wits on work how he might do ſomewhat that might
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102383:92"/>
regain his fame in the world, and at the ſame, recover the King's Favour. At laſt he gave out a Report, that he would by flying be in <hi>France,</hi> before the Kings Ambaſſadors, who were ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and were then actually under ſail, to purſue their Voyage; and that this might not be all talk without any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, he boldly appointed a Day and Place, which was <hi>Sterling</hi> from whence to begin his flight, the noiſe whereof brought (you may be ſure) a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of People together, among whom was the King himſelf.</p>
                  <p>When the Time was come, the man gets up to the Top of <hi>Sterling</hi> Caſtle, and having faſtned the Wings which he had made of the Feathers of ſeveral Fowls, to his ſides, he lifts himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Air, thinking to purſue his courſe. But alas, he came quickly down headlong to the ground, his Wings availing him nothing, whereupon the people, who knew not whether they ſhould rather Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke his Preſumption, or Pity his Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, flocked about him, and asked him how he did, he made Anſwer that he had broken his Thigh-bone, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of ever flying any more, at which they all laughed their fill: But this <hi>Ica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> to ſalve the matter, laid the fault of his flying wholly upon his Wings,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102383:93"/>
becauſe they were not made of Eagles Feathers and the like, but only of Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which were not fit to cut the Air with flight, and which by a certain innate Virtue, operating according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thoſe Fowl, drew the Feathers downwards to the Dunghill where thoſe Birds fed.</p>
                  <p>But to re-aſſume the Thread of our Story, things continued in a tollerable ſtate of Tranquillity, till the death of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. the <hi>King</hi>'s Father-in-law; but <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. a young, ambitious, and active Prince, had not long mounted the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne, when he makes Preparations to recover his Right in the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>French King</hi> to fortifie himſelf as much as poſſible againſt the impending Storm, requir'd Aid of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi>; who, by his Embaſſadors, would have accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated Matters, and perſwaded both Kings to a Peace: But King <hi>Henry</hi> perſiſting in his Reſolution, the <hi>Scot,</hi> won by <hi>French</hi> Promiſes of Money and Ammunition, joyns with them in League againſt <hi>England</hi>; and becauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to accommodate the Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both Nations, about ſome Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities and Depredations, committed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Borders, would not come up to their Terms, <hi>James</hi> takes this occaſion to ſend <hi>Lyon</hi> King at Arms to King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>

<q>King I am ſent to admoniſh thee that thou go not forward to the place which thou haſt determined, which warning if thou doſt deſpiſe, it ſhall ſucceed ill with thee, and all ſuch as ſhall attend thee: Further I am Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, to give thee Intelligence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, that thou eſchew the famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity and Cuſtom or Counſell of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, if thou do otherwiſe, it ſhall tend to thy Diſhonour and Hurt:</q>

The King who ſuppoſed there was nothing too hard for his Arms, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially now the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>French</hi> Wars, and being buoy'd up by the flattery of his Courtiers, jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged he could do that eaſily in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; but while he lay loitering at <hi>Ford,</hi> came an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Herauld into his Camp, requiring him to appoint a day and place where both Armies might give Battle; whereupon the King calls a Councell of War, wherein the greateſt part were of opinion that it was moſt adviſable they ſhould return home, leaſt they might with ſo ſmall a Force hazard the State of the whole Country, eſpecially ſeeing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102383:95"/>
they had already obtained ſufficient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, Glory, and Riches, and fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the League of Friendſhip made with the <hi>French</hi>; neither could there be any appearance of reaſon, that they who were now ſo much diminiſhed in their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ſo weakned with the Fatigues they had undergone, ſhould now be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſo great a multitude of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> daily increaſing with Re-inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for it was Rumored then, that the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> was arrived in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Camp with Six Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand old Soldiers from before <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the further inforcing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it was moreover added, That if the King did depart, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army muſt neceſſarily ſeperate, and could not be drawn together that Year again, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to march from the remoteſt Parts of the Kingdom: But and if the King muſt needs fight, that then it were more adviſable he ſhould do it in his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, keeping the appointment both of the Time and Place, always in his own Power; But when the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and ſuch Mercenary Courtiers as took <hi>French</hi> Penſions, oppoſed theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, the King, who was eager for Battle and to haſten his own Ruin, was eaſily perſwaded to wait for the Enemy,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102383:96"/>
in that Place. In the mean time when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did not advance and engage at the day appointed by the Herault; the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nobility laid hold of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity afreſh to go to the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom they laid the matter home again; Alledging, That the reaſon why they declined Battle, was an Artifice of the Enemy only to gain time 'till all their Forces were come together, while the <hi>Scotch</hi> dwindled away more and more; and therefore it was high time they ſhould have recourſe to the like Pollicy, and ſince the Enemy failed of their word, it was no ways diſgracefull to the <hi>Scots</hi> either to return into their own Country without giving them Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, or to Fight within their own Limits; of which Councel the firſt was infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the beſt, but if that were not approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off, there was abundant reaſon for to execute the latter; for ſeeing that the River <hi>Till</hi> was not foardable for ſome Miles ſpace, and could not be paſt by the Army but by one Bridge, there a few might be able to reſiſt a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; beſides, if part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were paſt the Bridge, the ſame might eaſily be broken, by Engines conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently placed for that purpoſe, ſo as to obſtruct the paſſage of the reſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them who of neceſſity muſt be cut
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102383:96"/>
to peices. But ſo was the King taken with his own Conceit, that you had as good have talked to a dead Man as to him, upon this head; And therefore he ſlightingly ſaid, <hi>That if the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Army were an Hundred Thouſand ſtrong, he would Fight them.</hi> With which raſh Anſwer the Nobility were very much diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon <hi>Archibald Dowglaſs,</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> a Man that far excelled the reſt of the Nobles, both in Years and Authority, endeavoured in a gentle O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to alter the King's Reſolutions, enlarges upon and ſhews the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and advantage of the former Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells given him by the Nobility; for he made it appear, that the King had been punctual in the League with <hi>France</hi> and gratified their Requeſt, in that he had now turned the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Arms before bent againſt the <hi>French,</hi> againſt himſelf, and againſt his own Country; and had ſo ordered his own Affairs, that thoſe great Armies ſhould neither injure <hi>France,</hi> nor endamage <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſeeing they were not long able to keep the field in thoſe cold Countries and a Barren Soyl, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſhed of neceſſaries for the ſupport of Life through the Calamy of the late Wars, and which at beſt produced but little Corn; but Winter was drawing near
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102383:97"/>
which in thoſe Northern parts was felt betimes. And (continued the Earl) as for the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors urging of us to come to a Battle, I cannot think that ſhould be looked upon as either new or ſtrange by us, that a Foreigner who hath no reſpect to the publick good of this Kingdom, but to the private intereſt of his own Nation, ſhould be ſo laviſh of other Mens blood: And beſides, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt is unreaſonable and impudent; for he would have the <hi>Scots</hi> do that which the <hi>French</hi> King, a Perſon of the higheſt Prudence, thinks not fit to do for his own Kingdom and Honour; neither ſhould the miſcarriage of this Army be looked upon by him as a ſmall loſs, becauſe they were not ſo numerous; for all thoſe are here, who excell either in Virtue, Authority and Counſell; and if theſe be once loſt, the ſurviving Commonalty will become an eaſy prey to the Conquerors. What, is it not at preſent ſafer and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al more profitable to protract the War? For if <hi>Lewis</hi> thinks that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> can either be exhauſted by Expences, or wearied with delay, what can be better, as to the preſent State of things, than for us to enforce the Enemy to divide their Forces, that we may keep one part of their Army to watch and look after our motion, making a continual ſhew of our
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102383:97"/>
readineſs to make Incurſions, and by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them under a conſtant apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof, eaſe the burden of the <hi>French</hi> by our Labour and Vigilancy; and I think thoſe men, who I fear, are more Valiant in Words than in Actions, have ſufficiently Conſulted for their Glory and Renown under which names they would couch their own temerity; for what could have been more honourable for the King, than to have raſed ſo many ſtrong Holds, waſted all with Fire and Sword, and to carry away ſo great Booty, that ſeveral Years Peace will not be able to reduce the Country to its former ſtate; And what greater benefit can we expect from the War, than that amidſt ſuch claſhing of Armor and noiſe of War, we ſhould enjoy Reſt with Wealth and Glory, to our greateſt Praiſe and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation by refreſhing our own Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and to the ignominy and ſhame of the Enemy? For that ſort of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which is won more by Counſel than by Arms, is a property of Man, but more peculiarly agreeable to the Conduct of a great Captain, in regard that the Soldiers can claim no manner of ſhare therein. Tho' all that were preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by their Faces, their Conſent hereunto; Yet it made no impreſſions upon the King, who had ſolemnly Swore
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102383:98"/>
and was now fully bent to Fight, and ſo he Command <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> if he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of his life to return home. The Earl finding things thus precipitated through the Kings temerity, and foreſeeing the dreadful Event, burſt forth into Tears; and as ſoon as he was able to Speak, ſaid, If the former courſe of my Life did not ſufficiently Vindicate my Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from the opinion of Cowardice, I know of no other reaſons whereby to purge my ſelf; I am ſure while this Body was able to endure the Toils of War and other Fatigues, I have never been ſparing to imploy the ſame, for the Honour of my King and Good of my Country; But ſeeing my Counſells wherein alone I can now be uſeful, are deſpiſed, I'll leave my two Sons, who next my Country are deareſt to me, and the reſt of my Friends and Kindred, as a certain pledge of my good Will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you and the publick good; and I pray unto God theſe my fears may prove Falſe and Abortive, and that I may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be accounted a falſe Prophet, than that what I fear and ſeem to behold ſhould come to paſs. When he had thus ſpoken, he packs up his Baggage and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts; the reſt of the Nobles ſeeing they could not draw the King to be of their mind, Judged it ought to be their
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102383:98"/>
next care ſeeing they were inferiour in number to the Enemy (for they had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Scouts that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army was ſix and twenty Thouſand ſtrong was to fortify themſelves by taking advantage of the ground, and ſo to pitch their Camp on the adjacent Hill, which was hard of acceſs and which they Fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt round with Cannon; in the Rear they had Hills, from the Foot of which to the Eaſt was a Marſh that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their Left Wing, and on their Right they had the River <hi>Till,</hi> with high Banks over which was a Bridge, not far from the Camp. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> when they found by their ſpies, that there was no approaching of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Camp without manifeſt danger, wheeled off from the River, and made as if they marched toward <hi>Berwick,</hi> and from thence ſtreight to the adjacent part of <hi>Scotland</hi> to Ravage the Country, and a Rumour of ſuch a deſign increaſed the ſuſpicion thereof: Which Rumour was ſome Days before ſpread abroad, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raſhly or purpoſely feigned by the the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they might decoy the <hi>Scots</hi> from their ſtrong Holds down into the Plains. King <hi>James</hi> thinking that not to be endured, ſets Fire to his Camp and Marched; The ſmoak blinded the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſo as that they could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102383:99"/>
the Enemy Marching; but at laſt both Armies came to <hi>Flodden</hi> Hills al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unknown to one another. There the <hi>Engliſh</hi> March their Artillery over the Bridge and their Army paſt the Ford at <hi>Milſord,</hi> and ſo draw up their Army in Battalia, as the ſituation of the ground, would admit, but in two Bodies; ſeeming to have a deſign to cuff off the <hi>Scots</hi> Proviſion. In the firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my the main Body was Commanded by the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> Admiral, who not long before was come with a ſtrong Re-inforcement to the Army; the Right Wing by <hi>Edmund Howard,</hi> and the Left by <hi>Marmaduke Conſtable.</hi> The other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was ſo poſted as if they had been for reſerves, and alſo drawn up in a tripartite diviſion, the Right being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Dacres,</hi> the Left by <hi>Stanley,</hi> and the Main Body by the Earl of <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey,</hi> who was General of the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The <hi>Scots</hi> made a forefold diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of their Army, whereof the King himſelf Commanded the Main Body, <hi>Alexander Gordon</hi> and <hi>Alexander Humes</hi> the Right Wing, <hi>Mathew Stuart,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lennox, Campell,</hi> Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> the Left: And <hi>Hepborn</hi> with the reſt of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>Lowthian,</hi> Commanded the reſerves. <hi>Gordon</hi> begins the Battle and quickly routed the Left Wing of the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102383:99"/>
                     <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, but returning from the Chaſe he found the remainder of his Wing almoſt cut to pieces. For the left Wing Commanded by <hi>Lennox</hi> and <hi>Argile,</hi> being elated at their Succeſs, fell on Pell-Mell without keeping their Ranks upon the Enemy, leaving their Enſigns behind-them: The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador doing all that ever he could to keep them back, as foreſeeing, they ruſhed on headlong to their inevitable ruin; But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtood the ſhock with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Bravery, and adding cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to their Valour, wheeled a body of their Men about, which fell upon the Rear of this diſorderly Rout and almoſt kill'd every Man of them. In the mean time the Main Body where the King was, with the reſerves Commanded by <hi>Hepborn,</hi> ſought with great obſtinacy, but at laſt were Rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but night coming on hindred the purſuit. Next morning the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> ſent out <hi>Dacres</hi> with a Party of Horſe to learn Intelligence, who coming to the field of Battle and finding the <hi>Scotch</hi> Artillery without any Guard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and the greateſt part of the ſlain unſtripped, he acquaints the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral therewith; who ſets his Army looſe to ranſack the Camp, and afterwards Celebrated the Victory with utmoſt Joy. And now we come to tell you of the

Kings Fate himſelf: Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians generally agree that he was ſlain in this Battle, the <hi>Scots</hi> for the moſt part oppoſe it; Urging, that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which was rifled in the field and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be his, was not ſo, but the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of one <hi>Alexander Elſinſtone,</hi> a young Gentleman reſembling the King both in Viſage and Stature, whom the King (that he might delude thoſe that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him, and at the ſame time alſo with his own preſence animate thoſe that fought elſewhere) had cauſed with all Tokens of Royality to be Armed and Apparelled like himſelf: But (ſays my <hi>Engliſh</hi> Author Biſhop <hi>Goodin</hi>) not to make uſe for an Argument the great number of Nobility that Guarded their true King and conſequently that their Counterfeit ones fought elſewhere; Its manifeſt that his Body was known by many of the Priſoners, who certainly affirmed, that it could be no other than the King's, tho' by the Multitude of his Wounds it were very much disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for his Neck was laid open in the midſt thereof with a long Wound, his left Arm almoſt cut off in two ſeveral places, could ſcarce hang to his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and had been beſides ſhot through ſeveral parts of his Body with Arrows; and this ſeems to have the greateſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102383:100"/>
of truth in it, tho' what <hi>Buchanan</hi> and others his Countrymen, alledge, is not improbable, <hi>viz.</hi> That after the King found the Battle encline to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> without any hopes of retriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, he paſſed the <hi>Tweed</hi> and near <hi>Kelſo</hi> was ſlain by <hi>Humes</hi>'s followers; it remaining uncertain, whether it was done by his Command, or that theſe Ruffians thinking to gratify the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of their Patron, were in hopes when the King was once cut off, they might tranſact what villany they pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed impunedly, but if he ſurvived, they were in great apprehenſions of being called to a ſevere account for their tardineſs during the Battle. To which they alſo add other conjectures; that the very night after the Battle, the Monaſtery of <hi>Kelſo</hi> was ſeiſed by one <hi>Carr</hi> a confident of <hi>Hume,</hi> and the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot chaſheered, which, its likely, he durſt not have attempted, if he had known the King had been alive: But theſe things are ſo uncertain, ſays <hi>Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> that when <hi>Hume</hi> was afterward called to an Account, and Tryed for the Fact, by the Earl of <hi>Murrey,</hi> the King's baſe Son; it came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, they were not able to prove it upon him, but withal adds, that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102383:101"/>
                     <hi>Lawrence Faliſer,</hi> a Perſon of integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but then a Lad and ſpectator of of the Action did often affirm to him, that he had ſeen the King on Horſe Back paſs the <hi>Tweed</hi>; and hence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny took occaſion to report (which laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many years) that the King was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and would appear in due time, after he had pay'd his vow of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to view the Holy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcre. But this ſavours two much like the legendary Story of <hi>Arthur</hi> of old, and of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> not many Years before, of whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated ſuch another Tale; But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and take for granted, that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as before noted) upon the place of Battle, his Body being encloſed in a Sheet of Lead was brought into <hi>England,</hi> and by the Kings Command laid in ſome bye Vault or Corner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Funeral rites, he ſaying, <hi>That it was a due puniſhment for one who had perjuriouſly broken his League</hi>; So that Death it ſelf had not put a Period to his misfortune; Tho' otherwiſe he was a Prince of great perfections both of Body and Mind, and endued with moſt of thoſe Royal Virtues that are neceſſary for the equal poize of a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But his return did variouſly affect the minds of the <hi>Scots,</hi> for ſeeing all the Publick buſineſs now tranſacted by the Conduct of the Queen and the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> a great many of the Nobility, the head whereof were <hi>John Steward,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> and <hi>Campell</hi> Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> taking it in very ill part that they were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to any part of the publick Adminiſtration, received the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> with high expreſſions of Joy, as hoping by his aid, either to gain over the Power of the adverſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to themſelves, or at leaſt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate their pride. On the other hand,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102383:105"/>
the Queen, who was alienated from her Husband, was much concerned at his arrival, and ſought by all means to undermine him: <hi>Hamilton</hi> alſo out of the relicts of his own Hatred was none of his Friend; beſides he feared, leaſt <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> who, he knew, would not be content with a ſecond place, ſhould mount the ſaddle, and make him truckle under, ſo that he ſtrain'd to maintain his own Dignity, and oppoſed him with all his might. They kept themſelves therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Edenburg</hi> Caſtle, and tho' they had ſeen very well, that many of the Nobility affected alterations, yet conſiding in the ſtrength of the place and the Authority of the Kingly Name, (a ſorry defence) they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſecure from all force. In the mean time the oppoſite party held a great meeting of the Nobles, where they choſe three of their own Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be Guardians both of King and Kingdom, and who ſhould they be, but the Earl of <hi>Angus, John Steward</hi> Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> and <hi>Colen Campell</hi> Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>; And uſing great Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in their buſineſs, firſt they paſſed the <hi>Forth,</hi> and cauſed <hi>James Beaton,</hi> a ſhrewd Man, to joyn with them; who perceiving the ſtrength of the

party, durſt not ſtand out. From thence they went to <hi>Sterling,</hi> and Conferred all publick Offices and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments upon ſuch as were of their own gang only, and afterwards di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected their march for <hi>Edenburg,</hi> which they entred without any reſiſtance. For it was not Fortifyed at all, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately fell to work with the Caſtle, about which they caſt a ſmall Trench and Beſieged it. The Defendants who had made no Proviſion for a Siege ſurrender'd up both it, themſelves, King and all. All were ſent away but the King, who now had more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially three new Maſters before named, and who take the whole weight of the Government upon their Shoulders. They agreed among themſelves, that they would manage it by turns, each of them attending four Months a piece upon the King, who was their prey: But this Conjunction was neither hearty nor of long duration. <hi>Dowg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs,</hi> his turn was firſt ſerved, who brought the King into the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Houſe, and made uſe of all the Biſhop's Furniture and other Accomodations as if they had been his own. (for he had a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore revolted from their Faction) and that the Earl might engage the King

When they were juſt ready to engage; <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> Commands <hi>George Hume</hi> to alight from his Horſe, and to manage his part in the fight, who anſwered, he would not: No not if the King himſelf Commanded him. This ſtruck ſome damp upon the <hi>Dowglaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> however to make a Virtue of neceſſity they fell on with very great Fury, as men who had their King, and who was the price of the Combat, to be ſpectator; the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> ſtanding by the King all the while, and not ſtriking a ſtroke. At laſt <hi>Walter Scot</hi> happening to be wounded, his men began to give ground, and at length fled out-right; but the loſs of <hi>Andrew Car,</hi> a Perſon of ſingular eminency did very much allay the joy of the <hi>Dowglaſſes</hi> for this Victory, and the carriage of <hi>Lennox,</hi> heightned their Jealouſy of him, ſo that he thought it adviſable to leave the Court; and leave the King ſtill a Captive and without hopes of Releaſement.

that end, they prudently make up the old breach betwixt Them and the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> a Family abounding in Wealth, Number, and Greatneſs, and admitted them into a ſhare of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. On the other hand the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> was highly in favour of moſt People, and having privately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the King's Letters to moſt of the Nobility, who he thought would have kept his Councel, he mightily ſtrenthened his Party; Wherefore in a convention of his faction at <hi>Sterling,</hi> where <hi>James Beaton</hi> and ſeveral other Biſhops were preſent, he openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them the deſign of aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the King to Liberty, which was Unanimouſly agreed to, tho' the day appointed for muſtering their Forces was not yet come: Yet hearing that the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> were Aſſembled at <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lithgow</hi> to intercept their march, it was thought adviſeable to attack them, before they joyned with the <hi>Dowglaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and accordingly <hi>Lennox</hi> with what preſent force he had with him marched directly towards them. But the <hi>Himiltons</hi> having got intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that the Earl would march out of <hi>Sterling</hi> that day early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had called the <hi>Dowglaſſians</hi> out of <hi>Edenburg</hi> to their aſſiſtance before: But the King to favour <hi>Lennox</hi> as well

And when <hi>George Dowglaſs</hi> had in vain flattered him to make more haſt, at laſt he broke forth in theſe menacing words, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q>Sir, Rather then our Enemies ſhould take you from us, we will lay hold on your body, and if it be rent in pieces, we will be ſure to retain one part thereof.</q>
Which words made ſuch an impreſſion upon his mind that when the <hi>Dowglaſſes</hi> were baniſhed ſome Years after, and that he had ſome inclination to recall the reſt of them, yet he could not endure to hear any body ſpeak of a Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with this <hi>George</hi>: The <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> betwixt fear of the Enemies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, and hope of aid at hand, had ſet themſelves in array at the Bridge of the River <hi>Aven,</hi> which is about a mile from <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> and placed a ſmall Guard upon the Bridge to ſecure the Paſs, and drew up the reſt of their Forces at the brow of the Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Victory was uſed by the <hi>Hamiltonians</hi> with much cruelty, and among the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſlain, was the Earl of <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox</hi> himſelf, highly lamented by all Perſons, and more eſpecially, by the King himſelf, who now ſaw no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible hopes of ever retrieving his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and could not chooſe but ſee, how fatal his preſence was to all that attempted it.</p>

But fury abating with time, and the <hi>Dowglaſſes</hi> being ſeverally intent upon other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and concerns, and ſecure, as they thought as to the Kings Departure from them, gave him at laſt an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to gain his Liberty, which all the former attempts of his Friends could not effect for him. They believed now, that his mind was fully Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to them by thoſe Blandiſhments and Immoderate Pleaſures they had indulged him in, and beſides, thought that if he were minded to remove, there was no faction ſtrong enough to oppoſe them, neither was there any ſtrong Garriſon whither to retire but only to <hi>Sterling</hi> Caſtle, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to the Queen for her Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And then it was deſerted for a time by the Queens Officers when ſhe hid her ſelf for fear of the <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſes,</hi> and when the tumult was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

The King having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſome ſmall relaxation, ſaw that this muſt be his only refuge, and and therefore he deals privately with his Mother to exchange that Caſtle and the Lands adjoining for other Lands, as convenient for her; and providing all other requiſites, as private as he could, the <hi>Dowglaſſes</hi> not being ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as formerly in their watch over him, he retired by night with a ſmall retinue from <hi>Falkland</hi> to <hi>Sterling,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſoon ſent for ſome of the Nobles to come to him, and others hearing the News came of their own accord, ſo that now he ſeemed ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſecured againſt all force.

too and fro for ſome Days, and no temper of Accommodation could be found out: But at length they came to this; That <hi>Tantallon</hi> Caſtle ſhould be ſurrendered to K. <hi>James,</hi> a Truce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both Nations for five Years, and the other demands in referrence to the <hi>Dowglaſſes</hi> he promiſed to grant under his Signet. When the Caſtle was ſurrendered according to Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, the King failed of his Royal Word, and not one of the <hi>Dowglaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> were permitted to return; which was foul prevarication in him, and a ſtain that will not eaſily be blotted off his Memory, ſeeing this was a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal matter in the Agreement and the Equivalent for the Caſtle. The Truce about half expired, was infringed by a War between both Nations: which the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador endeavoured to compoſe, and about the ſame time, <hi>James</hi> tranſacts with the <hi>French</hi> King and afterward with the Emperor about a Match, which was like to endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger his life; For the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> almoſt confident of the Succeſſion, yet look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it a long way about to ſtay either for Fortuitous or Natural dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to befall him, and fearfull in caſe he married, he might have Lawfull Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of his own, ſtudied to haſten his Death by Treachery. a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity

was offered them to effect it by his Night-walkings to his Miſſes, having but one or two in Company, but however it were, they ne'er could put their purpoſe in Execution. The Emperor's offers were rejected and at laſt he went over himſelf into <hi>France</hi> to ſeek him a Wife, and brings over along with him <hi>Magdelen</hi> Daughter to <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, but ſhe died ſoon after and had no iſſue. The Death of <hi>Magdalen</hi> did but whet his deſires to get him another Wife, and to that End he diſpatched Cardinal <hi>David Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and others into <hi>France</hi> to treat of a Match between himſelf and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> Widdow to the Duke of <hi>Longeville,</hi> by whom he had two Sons and a Daughter, of whom you'll hear by and by. But before her arrival in <hi>Scotland, John Forbes</hi> a young Gentleman of a great Family was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of a Deſign he had many years before, to Aſſaſſinate the King: It was believed to be a malitious proſecution of the <hi>Huntley</hi>'s, but Condemned he was and loſt his head; and a few Days after, came on another Tryal, which on the account of the Family of the accuſed Parties, the Novelty of it, and the heinouſneſs of the puniſhment was very Lamentable and Tragical, and plainly ſhews the Kings mind was cruel
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102383:112"/>
and implacable. <hi>Joan Dowglaſs,</hi> Siſter to the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> of whom we have ſaid ſo much, and Wife to <hi>John Lyons</hi> Lord of <hi>Glames</hi>; alſo her Son and lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Husband, <hi>Gileſpy Campell, John Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> Kinſman to her former Husband, and an old Prieſt were accuſed for endeavouring to poyſon the King. All theſe tho' they lived continually in the Country far from the Court, and their Friends and Servants could not be brought to witneſs any thing againſt them, yet were put on the rack, to extort a Confeſſion from them, and ſo were Condemned and ſhut up in <hi>Edenburg</hi> Caſtle. <hi>Joan Dowglaſs</hi> was burnt alive, with great Commiſeration of all the Spectators; The Nobleneſs both of her ſelf and Husband did much affect the beholders: Beſides ſhe was in the vigour of her youth, much celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for her rare Beauty, and in her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry puniſhment ſhe ſhewed a manlike Fortitude. But that which people were more concerned for, was, that they thought the enmity againſt her Brother who was baniſhed, did her more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice then her own objected Crime. Her Husband endeavoured to eſcape out of the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburg</hi>; but the Rope being too ſhort to let him down to the foot of the Rock, brake almoſt all the bones of his body with the fall, and ſo
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:102383:113"/>
ended his Days. Their Son, a young Man and of greater Innocent ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then to have the ſuſpicion of ſuch a wickedneſs juſtly charged upon him, was for all that ſhut up a Priſoner in the Caſtle; And the accuſer of all theſe, <hi>William Lyons</hi> by name, afterwards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that ſo eminent a Family was like to be utterly ruined by his falſe Information, Repented, when it was too late, and confeſſed his offence to the King. Yet ſo bloody was he (an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I think hardly to be parallelled in all the records of time) that it did not prevent the Execution of the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or hinder their Eſtates from being Confiſcate; and the aforeſaid young Gentleman was not diſcharged from his Impriſonment and Reſtored to his Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance till after the King's Death which is now upon the Wing. But as we have given you the Tragical part of his paſt life in all the Circumſtances of them, we ſhall depeint unto you all the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent cauſes of his Tragical and Untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Death and to that End; we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to recount ſome few things to you that in order of time precede; and you muſt note, That King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. having upon the account of his Divorce from Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> Proclaimed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf head of the Church, and utterly diſclaimed the Pope's Authority in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

and knowing that money was a bait that ſeldom failed, and would be very likely to catch him, they make an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the firſt place to pay him yearly out of the Rents of the Church, the ſum of Fifty Thouſand Crowns for the maintenance of ſome Regular Troops, beſides, the ordinary Subjects which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed his Proclamation, in caſe the King of <hi>England</hi> made War upon <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> upon the King's failure to keep the appointment at <hi>York</hi>: Yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that unleſs the matter was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and favourably interpreted to the King by ſuch as had his Ear, that would not do the buſineſs. Wherefore they made very liberal Gifts unto the K.

For the King had given the Ward and Marriage of <hi>Kelley</hi> in the County of <hi>Angus,</hi> to his ſecond Son, and he went thither to take poſſeſſion thereof: Thereupon they fall to work, make their propoſals to the King, which were ſtoutly backed by <hi>Oliver Sinclar</hi> and ſuch of the Clergy as had beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance at Court, and eſpecially at the time when they gratifyed his Luſt with mens Wifes and Maidens as before noted; and with all this oyling they found him at laſt pretty plyable, and this induced them to lay hold of the opportunity to ruin the Treaſurer, whom they ſuſpected to be the only <hi>Remora</hi> of their whole Deſign: And therefore they lay before him, how that he was turned Heretick, and had always a new Teſtament in <hi>Engliſh</hi> in his Pocket; and beſides, that through his Majeſties fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour he was grown ſo high and ſo proud
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:102383:117"/>
that there was no enduring of him; but withal ſo extream covetous, that he was the unfiteſt man alive for that Office; and overbold for procuring of the King the Ward of <hi>Kelley</hi> for his ſecond Son, which was worth Twenty Thouſand Pounds. But to this the King Anſwered, <hi>That he looked upon his Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to be a plain honeſt Gentleman, that he loved him ſo well, at that he would give him again the ſaid Ward and Marriage for a Word of his Mouth.</hi> The Prior of <hi>Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenweem,</hi> a cunning Fox, replies, <hi>Sir, the Heireſs of</hi> Kelley <hi>is a jolly fair Laſs, and I dare venture my life, that if your Majeſty will ſend for her preſently, he will refuſe to ſend her.</hi>

                  <p>But the King affirmed ſtill the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, till at laſt they procured him to ſend actually for the young woman, and the Prelates and their faction contrived it ſo that the ſaid Prior of <hi>Pittenweem</hi> ſhould carry the Letter, and Conduct the young woman back to the King.

The King who was then haſtning to <hi>Fife,</hi> ſent the young man to <hi>Edenburg</hi> to the Lords of the Seſſions, and ordered <hi>James Lermouth, James Kinnedy,</hi> and <hi>Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resky</hi> to meet, and charged them to give as much heed to what the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhould Declare as if he himſelf were preſent, and ſent them a Ring which they knew, from off his Finger for a Token.

The King therefore going to <hi>Edenburg,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Seaton,</hi> commands him to be tryed for his life, and having been Convicted, loſt his head. The Crime laid to his charge, was, that he had on a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain day, determined to break the Doors open and to murder the King, and had ſecret cabals with the <hi>Dowglaſſes</hi> that were publick Enemies.

                  <p>When <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. found himſelf thus baſely diſappointed by his Nephew, he was not a little incenſed thereat, and prepared an Army to invade <hi>Scotland.</hi> There were near two years ſpent with nothing but Incurſions on both ſides, there being neither a certain Peace nor a Juſt War between them; at length the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> drew near to the Marches, the <hi>Scots</hi> encounter the Duke with an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rault to expoſtulate concerning the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the War, and withal diſpatched the Ld. <hi>Gowrdon,</hi> with ſome ſmall Forces to defend the Frontiers; The Herault was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained till the <hi>Eng.</hi> Army came to <hi>Berwick,</hi> to prevent his giving them Intelligence of their ſtrength.

The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility did all they could to diſſwade him from it, and eſpecially ſhewed a great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs

that he ſhould any way haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his own Perſon, the loſs of his Father in like manner being freſh in their memories, and <hi>Scotland</hi> too ſenſible of the Calamities that enſued upon it.

The opportunity of an

The News of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat was no ſooner brought to the King, who was not far off, but he fell into a great rage and fury, which terminated in ſadneſs and heavy grief of heart, as <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> II. his great Anceſtor did upon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his Son <hi>James</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; and this brought him to watch and be abſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious, diſdaining to eat his Victuals: And coming to underſtand that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was full of murmurings that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould be thus endangered for the Prelates pleaſure, and knowing withal that ſuch Complaints were Juſt and True, this made him burſt out with ſome threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and revengeful language againſt ſuch as had given him ſuch bad advice, and ſo haſtned his untimely Death: For thoſe evil Councellors had no ſooner underſtood what he ſaid, but they conſidered the danger they might be in, if he ſhould ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, and fearing the Effects of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, they poiſoned him, having learnt the Art in <hi>Italy,</hi> called an <hi>Italian Poſit,</hi> in the Three and Thirtieth year of his Age, and two and Thirtieth of his Reign.

I call God to witneſs, that next to my ſelf, I know none that I would prefer before her, or if the matter come to a diſpute, that can exclude her; Thou knoweſt, ſaid ſhe, who are the Competitors, by what aſſiſtance, or in hopes of what Force, can ſuch poor Creatures attempt ſuch a mighty thing?</q>
After ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcourſe, the Concluſion was ſhort;
<q>That it was a buſineſs of great weight and moment, and that this was the firſt time ſhe had entertained ſerious thoughts about it, and therefore ſhe had need of longer time to diſpatch it.</q>
Some Days after ſhe ſent for the Ambaſſador again, and told him, That ſhe extreamly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered why the Nobility ſhould demand ſuch a thing of her, upon the firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the Queen, eſpecially knowing that the cauſes of former offences were not yet taken away;
But continued ſhe, <q>What, pray do they require? that I having been ſo much wronged ſhould before any ſatisfaction received gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify her in ſo large a manner; This demand is not far from a threat: If they proceed on in this way, let them know, that I have Force at home, and Friends abroad as well as they, who will defend
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102383:128"/>
my juſt right.</q>
To which he anſwered, That he had ſhewn clearly at firſt, how that the Nobility had inſiſted on this hopefull Medium of Concord, partly out of Duty to their own Queen, in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to maintain her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>weal, and increaſe her Dignity, and partly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to contribute and ſettle publick Peace and Amity, and that they dealt more plainly with her then with any other Prince. In this Cauſe, proceeds, ſaid he, your known and experimented good will towards them, and alſo upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their own ſafety; For they knew they muſt venture Life and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune if any body did oppoſe the right of the Queen, or if any War did ariſe betwixt the Nations on that Account. And therefore their deſires did not ſeem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warantable or unjuſt, as tending to the cradicating the ſeeds of all Diſcords and the ſettling of a firm and ſolid Peace.
She rejoyned, <q>If I had Acted any thing that might diminiſh your Queens right, then your demand might have been Juſt, that what was amiſs might be amended; but this poſtulation is without an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that I ſhould wrap my ſelf up in my Winding-Sheet while I am alive, neither was the like asked before by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prince; however I take not the good intention of your Nobility amiſs and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:102383:128"/>
the rather becauſe it is an Evidence to me, that they have a deſire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Intereſt and Honour of their Queen; And I do put as great a value upon their prudence in providing for their own ſecurity, and of being tender of ſhedding Chriſtian Blood, which could not be avoided if any faction ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe to Challenge the Kingdom, but what ſuch party can there be, or where ſhould they have Force? But to let theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations paſs, ſuppoſe I were inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to aſſent to their demands, do you think I would do it rather at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Nobles than of the Queen her ſelf? But there are many other things that avert me from ſuch a Tranſaction. Firſt, I am not ignorant how dangerous a thing it is to venture upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, the diſceptation concerning the right of the Kingdom I always mightily avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the controverſy has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſo much canvaſſed in the months of many, concerning a Juſt and Lawfull Marriage, and what Children were Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards and what Legitimate, according as every one is addicted to this or that that party; that by reaſon of theſe diſputes, I have been hitherto more back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in Marrying. Once when I took the Crown publickly upon me, I Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried my ſelf to the Kingdom, and I
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:102383:129"/>
wear the Ring I then put on my Finger, as a Badge thereof, however my Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution ſtands, <hi>I will be Queen of</hi> England <hi>as long as I live,</hi> and when I am dead let that Perſon Succeed in my place which hath moſt right to it, and if that chance to be your Queen, I will put no obſtacle to it. But if another hath a better Title, 'twere an unjuſt Requeſt to me, to make a publick edict to his prejudice; If there be any Law againſt your Queen 'tis unknown to me, and I have no great delight to ſift into it, but if there ſhould be any ſuch Law, I was ſworn at my Coronation that I would not change my Subjects Laws. As for the Second Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation, that the Declaration of my Succeſſor will knit a ſtricter bond of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity betwixt us, I am afraid rather it will be a ſeminary of hatred and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; What do you think I am willing to have ſome of my Grave Cloaths al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways before my Eyes? Kings have this peculiarity, that they have ſome kind of ſentiments againſt their own Children, who are born Lawfull Heirs to Succeed them. Thus <hi>Charles</hi> VII. of <hi>France</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſguſted <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. and <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. and of late <hi>Francis</hi> ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented <hi>Henry,</hi> and how it is likely, I ſhould ſtand affected towards my Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, If ſhe be once Declared my
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102383:129"/>
Heir, juſt as <hi>Charles</hi> VII. was towards <hi>Lewiss</hi> XI. beſides, and that which weighs moſt with me, I know the inconſtancy of this people, I know how they loath the preſent State of things, I know how intent their Eyes are upon a Succeſſor. 'Tis natural for all men as the Proverb is, <hi>To worſhip rather the riſing than ſetting Sun.</hi> I have learned that from my own times, to omit other Examples when my Siſter <hi>Mary</hi> was ſat at the Helm, how eager did ſome Men deſire to ſee me placed on the Throne, How ſollicitous were they in advancing me thereto; I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant what danger they would have undergone to bring their deſign to an iſſue, if my Will had concurred with their Deſigns: Now perhaps the ſame Men are otherwiſe minded, juſt like Children when they dream of Apples in their ſleep, they are very Joyfull, but waking in the morning, and finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fruſtrate of their hopes their mirth is turned into mourning. Thus I am dealt with by thoſe, who whilſt I was yet a private Woman, wiſhed me ſo well; If I looked upon any of them a little more pleaſant than ordinary, they thought preſently with themſelves that as ſoon as ever I came to the Throne, they ſhould be rewarded rather at the rate of their own deſires, than of the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:102383:130"/>
Service they performed for me.</q>
But now ſeeing the event hath not anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red expectation, ſome of them do gape after a new change of things in hopes of a better Fortune, for the wealth of a Prince, tho never ſo great cannot ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the unſatiable deſires of all Men: But if the good will of my Subjects do flag towards me, or if their minds are changed, becauſe I am not profuſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in my Largeſſes, or for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe, what will be the event, when the malevolent ſhall have a Succeſſor na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to whom they may make their grievances known, and in their anger and pet betake themſelves? What dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhall I then be in, when ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a Neighbour Prince is my Succeſſor, the more ſtrength I add to her in aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining her Succeſſion, the more I detract from my own ſecurity; This danger can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be avoided by any precautions, or by any bands of Law; yet thoſe Princes who have hope of a Kingdom offer'd them, will hardly contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within the bounds either of Law or Equity: for my part if my Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor were publickly declared to the World, I ſhould think my affairs to be far from being ſettled and ſecured.</p>

                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:102383:130"/>A few days after, the Ambaſſador asked the Queen, Whether ſhe would return any Anſwer to the Letter of the Scottiſh No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility? I have nothing, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> at preſent, to anſwer, only I commend their Diligence and Love to their Prince, but the matter is of ſuch great weight, that I cannot ſo ſoon give a plain and expreſs anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, but when the Queen ſhall have done her Duty, in Confirming the League ſhe obliged her ſelf to Ratifie, then 'twill be ſeaſonable to try my Affection towards her; in the mean time, I cannot gratifie her in her Requeſt without Diminution to my own Dignity: The Ambaſſador reply'd, He had no Command about that Affair, nor ever had any Diſcourſe with his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs concerning the ſame; neither did he then propound the Queen's Judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Right of Succeſſion but his own, and had brought Reaſons to enforce it; but as as for the Confirmation of the League by her Husband, 'twas inforced from the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> without the Conſent of thoſe to whom the Ratifying or Diſannulling thereof did much concern; neither was the thing of ſuch conſequence, as therefore to exclude her and her Poſterity from the Inheritance of <hi>England</hi>; I do not enquire, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> by whom, how, when, by what Authority, and for what Reaſon that League was made, ſeeing I had no command to ſpeak about any ſuch matter; but this I dare affirm, that though it were confirmed by her in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102383:131"/>
Compliance with her Husbands Deſire, yet ſo great a ſtreſs depending on it, his Queen in time, would find out ſome reaſon or other, why it ſhould and ought to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved: I ſpeak not this, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> in the name of the Queen, but my intent is to ſhew, that our Nobility have cauſe for what they do, that ſo all Controverſies being plucked up by the Roots, a firm and ſure Peace may be eſtabliſhed amongſt us. As this aggravated the Spirits of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſo it was no doubt a great Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to Queen <hi>Mary</hi>; but truckle ſhe muſt, and ſo ſhe confirmed the League, reſigning any Pretenſions to wear the Arms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> during the others Life; and ſome time after an interview be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both Queens was appointed to be at <hi>York,</hi> but ſome accidents fell out that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it, and though the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was afterwards detained in <hi>England</hi> for ſo many years together, (the cauſes whereof we are now a going to ſhew you) yet they never ſaw one another all their days; and becauſe the Story of <hi>David Rizzio</hi> has ſo great a Connection with the Misfortunes of this Queen, it will be neceſſary in this place to give you the Particulars of it.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>David Rizzio</hi> was born at <hi>Turin</hi> in <hi>Savoy,</hi> his Father an honeſt poor Man, that got a mean livelihood for himſelf and his Family, by Teaching the Elements of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and having no other Patrimony to leave his Children, he made them all, of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102383:131"/>
both Sexes, skillful Muſicians. <hi>David</hi> was one of the number, who being in the Prime of his Youth, and having an excellent Voice, was by his Skill in Muſick raiſed up to the hopes of a better Fortune; he went firſt to <hi>Nice,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> then kept his Court, but meeting with no entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there conformable to his hopes, and contriving every way how to relieve him in his Penury, he light upon one <hi>Morretius,</hi> who, by the Dukes Command was then preparing to go for the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whom he followed thither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retius</hi> being himſelf a Man of no great Fortune, and looking upon his Service as uſeleſs and unneceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>David</hi> reſolved to ſtay in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and try his Fortune there, eſpecially becauſe he underſtood the Queen delighted in Muſick, and was not ignorant of the Rudiments thereof her ſelf; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to make way into her Preſence, he firſt dealt with her Muſicians, of whom many were French, to admit him to be one of their Society, which they did; and having plaid his part once or twice, was liked very well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereupon he was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to be one of their Set or Company, and he ſo complied with the Queen's Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that what by flattering of her, and what by undermining of others, he grew into high Favour with her, and into the extream Hatred of his Fellows; neither did he Content himſelf with this favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able blaſt of Fortune, but he held his
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102383:132"/>
equals in Contempt, and by ſundry Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations wormed them out of their places, and began to Treat about Matters of State, and at laſt was made Secretary, and by that means had private Converſe with the Queen apart from others. The ſudden advance of this Man from a low and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt beggerly State to ſuch Power, Wealth, and Grandeur, afforded matter of Diſcourſe to the People; his Fortune was far above his Virtue, and his Arrogance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his Equals, and Contention with Superiours, did far exceed his Fortune; and this Vanity and Madneſs of the Man was much augmented by the flattery of the Nobility, who ſought his Friendſhip, Courted him, and admired his Judgment, walked before his Lodgings obſerving his Egreſs and Regreſs; but the Earl of <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi> alone, the Queen's baſe Brother, but a Man of Virtue and Sobriety, and ſuch as had no Diſſimulation in his Heart, was ſo far from fawning on <hi>David,</hi> that he gave him many a ſoure look, which troubled the Queen as much as <hi>David</hi> himſelf: Now about this time, did <hi>Matthew Steward,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> get leave of the Queen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Scotland,</hi> with his Son, <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Darnley,</hi> a young Nobleman of an high Lineage, and moſt goodly Perſonage, being Couſin German to the Queen, who received him very Courteouſly, and delighting daily in his Society, did at laſt reſolve to Marry him. <hi>David</hi> therefore to make his Party

good againſt <hi>Murray,</hi> applies himſelf with great Adulation to this young Gentleman, who was to be the Queen's Husband, ſo that he came to be ſo familiar with him, as to be admitted to his Chamber and Bed ſide, and to ſecret Conference with him, where he perſwaded him, out of his unwary Credulity and forwardneſs to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs his deſires, that he was the chief occaſion to make the Queen caſt her Eye upon him; beſides, he caſt in Seeds of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord between him and <hi>Murray</hi> every day, as knowing, that if he were removed, he ſhould paſs the remainder of his Life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Affront or Diſturbance; and there being now much talk abroad, not only of the Queen's Marriage with <hi>Darnley,</hi> and his ſecret Recourſe to her, but alſo of the too great familiarity between her and <hi>David Rizzio, Murray</hi> by his down-right dealing with her upon theſe accounts, got nothing but her Hatred, and ſo leaves the Court, that he might not be thought the Author of what was acted there; but the Queen finding that <hi>Murray</hi> was highly favoured of the People, was ſo incenſed againſt him, that ſhe haſtened his long before deſigned end, and the manner to accompliſh it was thus: <hi>Murray</hi> was to be ſent for to <hi>Perth,</hi> where the Queen was with a few Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, there <hi>Darnley</hi> was to Diſcourſe him, and in the Conference they all knew he would ſpeak his Mind freely, and then a Quarrel would ariſe, upon which, <hi>David
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:102383:133"/>
Rizzio</hi> was to give the firſt blow, and then the reſt were to wound him to Death. <hi>Murray</hi> was made acquainted with this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy by his Friends at Court, yet, come what would, he reſolved to go; but as he was on his Journey, being again advertiſed of the deſign by <hi>Patrick Ruuen,</hi> he turned aſide to his Mother's Houſe near <hi>Loch-Levin,</hi> and being troubled with a Lask, excuſed himſelf, and ſtaid there. Thither ſome of his Friends came to viſit him, whereupon a Report was preſently ſpread about, that he ſtaid there to intercept the Queen and <hi>Darnley</hi> in their return to <hi>Edenburg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This hopeful Plot was the Preludium to the unhappy Marriage that ſoon after ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, to which end a great part of the Nobility were called together at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> that ſo the Queen might countenance her Will and P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Vulgar alſo were very free in their Debates about the freedom or not freedom of the Queen to Diſpoſe of her ſelf in Marriage, till at length came an Engliſh Ambaſſador, who declared, That his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs did much admire, that ſeeing both of them were equally Allied to her, they ſhould precipitate ſo great an Affair with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acquainting her with it; and therefore ſhe earneſtly deſired that they would ſtay a while, and weigh the thing ſomewhat more ſeriouſly, to the great Benefit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably of both Kingdoms. But this Embaſſy effected nothing, ſo that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> diſpatched Sir <hi>Nicholas Throgmorton</hi> to tell the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> and his Son, that they had a Convoy from her to return at a ſet day into <hi>England,</hi> and that day was now paſt, and therefore ſhe commanded them to return, which if they refuſed, they were to be Baniſhed, and their Goods Confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But this Commination would not do neither, but they perſiſted in their purpoſe;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:102383:134"/>
and becauſe the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> would not be thought to Marry a private man, ſhe Creates <hi>Darnley</hi> Duke of <hi>Rothſay,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Roſs</hi>; moreover, the Predictions of Wizzardly Women in both Kingdoms, did contribute much to haſten the Marriage, who Propheſied, That if it were Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate before the end of <hi>July,</hi> it foretold much future advantage to them both; if not, much Reproach and Ignominy; which Predictions, how true, will appear by and by. Beſides, there were Rumours ſpread abroad of the Death of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and the day mentioned before which ſhe ſhould Die.</p>
                  <p>This Marriage was no ſooner Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and Proclaimed by an Herauld at Arms in <hi>Edenburg,</hi> and elſewhere, but the People began to murmur grievouſly, and eſpecially the abſent Nobility ſtormed mightily at it; and did not only reſt there, but take up Arms: but having no good Correſpondence one with another, they were ſoon diſſipated and ſuppreſt; and in ſome time after a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the Eſtates of the Kingdom was Indicted to be held, that ſo the Goods of thoſe who were Baniſhed might be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate, their Names ſtruck out of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and their Armorial Enſigns torn to pieces. And the Queen was continually ſolicited by <hi>David Rizzio,</hi> to cut off ſome of the Chief of the Faction, and to have a Guard of Foreigners about her Perſon, (a project that is wont to be the beginning
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:102383:134"/>
of all Tyranny,) and becauſe they ſhould be the more at <hi>David</hi>'s Devotion, they muſt conſiſt of Italians, his own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; but becauſe this muſt not be done bare-faced, they were to come in from <hi>Flanders</hi> by piece-meal, one by one, and at ſeveral times too, which way of proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure was another ſtep towards this Queen's Ruin. But as <hi>David</hi>'s Power and Authority with the Queen daily increaſed, ſo the King grew into greater Contempt with her every day; for as ſhe had raſhly precipitate in Conſummating the Marriage, ſo did ſhe as ſoon repent of it, and gave manifeſt Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of her alienated Mind. For as ſhe had preſently after the Celebration of the Marriage, publickly proclaimed him King by an Herauld, without the Conſent of the States; and that afterwards, in all her Mandates, till that time, the King and Queens Names were expreſt, now ſhe changed the Order, keeping both Names in, but ſetting her own down firſt. At length, the Queen, to deprive her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of any opportunity to do Courteſies to any, began to find fault with him, that whilſt he was buſie in Hawking and Hunting, many ſlight matters were acted unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, or elſe were wholly neglected: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would do better that ſhe ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe her Name for them both, and by this means he might enjoy his Pleaſure, and yet no publick Buſineſs be retarded. The poor King was willing to gratifie her in every
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:102383:135"/>
thing, and yielded to be diſmiſt upon ſuch frivolous Grounds, that ſo being remote from tha Council and Privacy of publick Affairs, the obligation for all Boons might redound to the Queen her ſelf. For theſe were her Thoughts, that if her Husbands Favour could do no good Offices to any, and his Diſpleaſure were formidable to none, he would by Degrees come to be contemned of all. And further to increaſe the Indignity, <hi>David</hi> was ſubſtituted, with an Iron Seal, to impreſs the Kings Name on Proclamations: Being thus fraudulently Coſened out of Publick Buſineſs, leaſt he might alſo prove an interrupter of their private Pleaſures, he was diſpatch'd away in a very ſharp Winter, to a place called <hi>Debly,</hi> with a very ſmall Retinue, far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Dignity of ſome private Perſons, for a Prey rather then for any Recreation; At the ſame time fell ſuch a quantity of Snow, that the place, which was not very plentiful at beſt, and beſides troubled with Thieves, was enough to ſtarve him, who was bred always at Court, and uſed to a Liberal Diet: And he would have been in great hazards of wanting Neceſſaries, had not the Biſhop of <hi>Orkney</hi> caſually came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he knowing the ſcarcity of the place, brought with him ſome Wine, and other Proviſions for his uſe.</p>
                  <p>The Queen, not Content to advance <hi>David,</hi> and as 'twere, to ſhew him to the People, from ſuch an obſcure Original, on
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102383:135"/>
the account before-mentioned, but ſhe took Counſel another way, how to Cloath him with Domeſtick Honour; for whereas the Queen had for ſome Months paſt permitted more Company than uſual to ſit with her at Table, that ſo <hi>David</hi>'s place in the crowd might be leſs envyed; She thought, by this ſhew of Popularity to gain the point, that the unaccuſtomedneſs of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ight might by the multitudes of gueſt and daily uſage, be ſomewhat alleviated, and ſo mens high Spirits by degrees be innured to bear any thing. But at laſt, it went ſo far, that none but he and one or two more fate at Meat with her; and that the narrowneſs of the Room might detract ſomething from the Envy of the thing, ſhe would ſometimes Eat her Junkets in a little Parlour, and ſometimes alſo at <hi>David</hi>'s Lodgings; but the Methods ſhe thus uſed to leſſen, did but increaſe the Reflections, for this maintained Suſpicions, and adminiſtred occaſions to add Diſcourſes. Now were Men's Thoughts let looſe, and they were influenced the more, that <hi>David,</hi> in Houſhold-ſtuff, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel, and number of brave and ſtately Horſes, exceeded even the King himſelf; and it made the matter look the worſe, that all this Ornament did not credit his Face, but that rather his Face ſpoiled all this Ornament. But the Queen not being able to amend the fault of Nature, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by heaping Riches and Honour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, to raiſe him up to the Degree of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102383:136"/>
the Nobles, that ſo ſhe might hide the meanneſs of his Birth, and the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Body too, with the vail of his lofty Promotions; but care muſt be had that he ſhould be advanced by Degrees, leaſt he might ſeem to be but a poor mercenary Senator. The firſt attempt was made upon the account of a piece of Land, near the City of <hi>Edenburg,</hi> called by the <hi>Scots, Malvil:</hi> The Owner of the Land, together with his Father-in-Law, and others that were beſt able to perſwade him, were ſent for, and the Queen dealt with the preſent Poſſeſſor to part with his Inheritance; and ſhe deſired his Father-in-Law and Friends to perſwade him to it: But this matter not meeting with the deſired ſucceſs, the Queen took the repulſe as a great Affront to her, and which was worſe, <hi>David</hi> took it very hainouſly alſo. Theſe things being known abroad, the Commonalty began to bewail the ſad ſtate of Affairs, and expected that things would grow worſe, if Men, eminent for their Families, Eſtates, and Credit, ſhould be outed of their ancient Patrimony, to gratifie the Luſt of a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly Varlet. Yea, many of the Elder ſort called to mind, and told others of the time, when <hi>Cockburn</hi> wickedly ſlew the Kings Brother, and of a Stone-cutter, was made Earl of <hi>Marr,</hi> which raiſed up ſuch a flame of a Civil War that could not be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed but by the Death of the King, and almoſt the Deſtruction of the Kingdom.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102383:136"/>
Theſe things were ſpoken openly, but Men did privately mutter much worſe; yet the King would never be perſwaded to believe it, unleſs he ſaw it with his own Eyes; ſo that one time hearing, that <hi>David</hi> was gone into the Queen's Bed-Chamber, he came to a little Door, of which he always carried the Key about him, and found it Bolted on the inſide, which it never uſed to be: whereupon he knocked, but no body an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and ſo he was forced to go his ways, but conceived great Wrath and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation in his Heart that he could not ſleep that Night. From that time forward he conſulted with ſome of his Servants, (for he durſt truſt but a very few, many of them having been corrupted by the Queen, and put upon him rather as Spies over his Actions, than Attendants upon his Perſon) how to rid <hi>David</hi> out of the way: His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign they approved of, but to find out a probable way to effect it was the difficulty. When that Conſultation had been managed for ſome days, others of his Servants, who were not privy to the Deſign, ſuſpecting the matter, and there being evident ſigns of it, went and acquainted the Queen therewith, and withall told her, that they would bring her to the place where they were, and they were as good as their words. For to that end they obſerved and watcht the opportunity, when others were ſhut out, and the King had only his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents about him, and ordered it ſo, that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:102383:137"/>
the Queen, as if paſſing through his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to her own, ſurprized him with her Partizans: whereupon ſhe inveighed bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt him, and highly threatned his Domeſticks, telling them all their Plots were in vain, for ſhe knew all their Minds and Actions, and would remedy them well enough in due time. Things being brought to this deſperate paſs, the King thought fit to acquaint his Father, the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> with his ſad Condition; and after ſome Conference, they both concluded, that the only remedy for the preſent Malady, was to reconcile that part of the Nobility which were preſent, and to recal thoſe that were abſent. But great expedition was required in the thing, becauſe the day was near at hand, wherein the Queen had reſolved to Condemn the Nobles that were abſent, having appointed a Convention of the States for that purpoſe, againſt the Wills of the Engliſh and French Ambaſſadors, who interceeded in the caſe; for they well knew that the accuſed had not committed ſuch heinous Offences, and beſides, foreſaw the danger that would enſue thereupon. About the ſame time did Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſend her a very obliging and long Letter, full of good Advice in reference to the preſent State of her Kingdom, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to reduce her from a wrathful to a reconcileable Temper. The Queen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to underſtand that the Nobility knew that ſuch Letters were come, and that they
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:102383:137"/>
gueſſed at the Contents of them, ſhe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited a civiller reſpect to them than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and began to read the Letters in the preſence of many of them. But when ſhe was got about the middle, <hi>David</hi> ſtood up, and bid her, <hi>Read no more, ſhe had read enough, ſhe ſhould ſtop</hi>; which ſtrange car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his ſeemed to them rather Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant than New, for they knew how impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly he had carried it towards her here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, yea, and ſometimes how he would reprove her more ſharply than ever her own Husband durſt do.</p>
                  <p>At that time the Cauſe of the Baniſhed Lords was hotly agitated in the Parliament Houſe; ſome to gratifie the Queen's Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour would have the puniſhment due to Traytors paſt upon them; others ſtiffly contended, that they had done nothing worthy to be ſo ſeverely uſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But <hi>David</hi> in the mean time went about to all of them, one by one, to feel their Pulſes, what every Man's Vote would be concerning the Exiles, if he was choſen Preſident by the reſt of the Convention; And he told them plainly, the Queen was reſolved to have them Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, that it was in vain for any of them to ſtruggle againſt it, and beſides, who ever did, ſhould be ſure to incu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:102383:138"/>
the Articles, or at leaſt that the major part might be of ſuch a Gizzard as to pleaſe the Queen; and this audacious procedure and wickedneſs in ſo mean a Fellow, was feared by ſome and hated by all.

However they were willing to truſt him, amongſt ſome few more, in a matter of ſo great a Concernment, both by reaſon of his great Prudence, as alſo becauſe his Children were Couſin-Germans to the King. But here the King was told by them, what a great Error he had committed before in ſuffering his Kinſmen and Friends to be driven from Court, in favour of ſuch a baſe Raſcal as <hi>Rizzio</hi>; yea, that he himſelf did in effect thruſt them out of the Court with his own Hands, and ſo had advanced ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Muſhroom, ſo as that now he himſelf was abaſhed and deſpiſed of him. They had alſo much other diſcourſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the State of the publick, and the King was quickly brought to acknowledge his Fault, and to promiſe, to act nothing for the future without the Conſent of the Nobility.</p>

to all the People. There was a conſtant Report at that time, That one <hi>John Damiot</hi> a French Prieſt, counted a Conjurer, told <hi>David</hi> once or twice, that now he had fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered his Neſt, it was time for him to be gone, and withdraw himſelf from the Envy of the Nobles, who would at length prove too hard for him, and that he ſhould make anſwer, The Scots were greater Threatners than Fighters: He was alſo warned a little before his Death, That he ſhould take heed of a Baſtard, to which he replied, That as long as he lived, no Baſtard ſhould have ſo much Power in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as that he had need to be afraid of him; for he thought his Danger was predicted from the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> the Queen's Natural Brother; but the Prophecy was either fulfilled or eluded, by <hi>George Dowglaſs</hi>'s giving him the firſt Blow, who was a baſe begotten Son of the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi>; after he had began, then every one ruſhed in to ſtrike him, either to Revenge their own particular Grief, or the publick Concern. This was the end of the ſo highly honoured <hi>David Rizzio,</hi> whoſe Original and Profeſſion we have given you an account of before, and to which laſt, with ſome other of the now recited paſſages, no doubt of it, <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of <hi>France</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards alluded, when one in his preſence, taking occaſion to extol the Wiſdom of King <hi>James,</hi> and calling him by the Name of <hi>Salomon,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Well he might be termed ſo, ſeeing he was the Son of</hi> David <hi>the Fidler.

David</hi> was no ſooner killed, but a tumult aroſe all the Houſe over, for the Earls of <hi>Huntley, Athol,</hi> and <hi>Bothwell,</hi> who were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at Supper in another part of the Palace, were ruſhing out, but they were kept within their Chamber by thoſe who guarded the Courts below, and had no harm done them: When <hi>Ruven,</hi> (who you ſee, was a prime Manager of this Affair, and who did as it were give <hi>David</hi> his Death's Wound, by commanding of him out of the Queen's Preſence as aforeſaid) went out of that Privy-Room into the Queen's Bed Chamber, where not being able to ſtand, becauſe of his Weakneſs, he ſat down and called for ſomething to Drink; whereupon the Queen fell upon him with ſuch Words, as her preſent grief and fury ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to her, calling him a Perfidious Traytor, asking him, How he durſt be ſo Impudent as to be in her Preſence, ſitting, whereas ſhe her ſelf ſtood; this he excuſed, as not done out of any Contempt or want of the Senſe of his Duty, but out of the weakneſs of his Body; but gravely and wiſely adviſed her, that in managing the Affairs of the Kingdom, ſhe would rather Conſult the Nobility, who had a concern in the publick, than Vagrant Raſcals, who could give no pledge of their Fidelity, and who had nothing to hazard, either in Eſtate or Credit; neither was the Fact then committed without a Preſident; that <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was a Kingdom bounded by Laws, and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:102383:140"/>
was never wont to be govern'd by the Will and Pleaſure of any one Man, but by the Regulation of the Law, and Conſent of the Nobility; and if any former King had done otherwiſe, 'tis certain he had ſmarted ſeverely for it: Neither were the <hi>Scots</hi> at this day ſo far degenerated from their Anceſtors, as to bear not only the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but even the Servitude of a Stranger, who was ſcarce worthy to be their Slave: This Speech did enrage the Queen more than before; whereupon the company de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, having placed Guards in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient places for fear any Tumults ſhould ariſe.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time what was tranſacted flew all over the Town, and as every ones Diſpoſition was, right or wrong, they took Arms, and away they went to the Palace, where the King ſhewed himſelf unto them out of a Window, and told the multitude, That he and the Queen were ſafe, and that there was no cauſe for their Tumultuous Aſſembly; for what was done, was done by his Order, and what that was ſhould be known in due time, and therefore at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent every one ſhould go to his own Houſe; upon which command they withdrew, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome few that ſtaid to keep Guard. Next morning, the Nobles that returned from <hi>England,</hi> taking the opportunity, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to come to their Trial in the Town-Hall, being ready to plead their Cauſe, for that was the day appointed, but none ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing

againſt them, they openly proteſted it was not their Fault, for they were ready to ſubmit to a Legal Trial, and ſo every one returned to his own Lodgings. The Queen, under theſe Perplexities, ſent for her Brother <hi>Murray,</hi> and after a long Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, gave him hopes that ſhe would for ever after commit her ſelf to her Nobles; hereupon the Guards were ſlackened, tho' many thought that her Clemency did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage no good to the publick, for ſhe ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together the Soldiers of her old Guard, and went through a back Gate by night, with <hi>George Seaton,</hi> who attended upon her with 800 Horſe, firſt to his own Caſtle, then to <hi>Dumbar:</hi> She alſo carried the King along with her, who for fear of his Life, was forced to Obey. When ſhe came thither, ſhe haſtned to gather Forces together, and pretending a Reconciliation with thoſe that were lately returned from Baniſhment, ſhe turned her fury upon the Slayers of <hi>David,</hi> and put out a ſevere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation againſt them; many of them that were accuſed were Baniſhed, ſome to one place and ſome to another; ſome were Fined, but they that were moſt Innocent, and therefore thought themſelves moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, were put to Death; but the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Contrivers of the Fact were fled, ſome to <hi>England,</hi> and others to the <hi>Highlands</hi>

And to increaſe the Indignity of the thing, ſhe put the Varlet almoſt in the Arms of <hi>Magdalen de Valois,</hi> the late Queen: As for her Husband, ſhe threatned him, and obliquely in her Diſcourſes ſcoff'd at him, doing her utmoſt endeavour to take away all Power from him, and to render him as contemptible as ſhe could: But the time of her Delivery now drawing nigh, ſhe was Reconciled to the Earls of <hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle,</hi> and retir'd to <hi>Edinburg</hi>-Caſtle, where on the 19th day of <hi>June</hi> 1566. a little after 9 in the morning, ſhe was brought to Bed of a Son, afterward called <hi>James</hi> the Sixth of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Firſt of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>

As for his Apparel and Dreſs, ſhe threw the Fault upon the Embroiderers, Goldſmiths, and other Tradeſmen, tho' it was but a falſe ſhamleſs pretence; For it, was well known to every body, it was her doings. Whereas for <hi>Bothwell</hi>'s Ornament, ſhe wrought many of them with her own Hands; beſides the Foreign Ambaſſadors were adviſed, not to enter into any Conference with the King, tho' they were in the ſame Caſtle together, for the moſt part of the Day.</p>
                  <p>The young Gentleman being thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteouſly uſed, expoſed to the ſcorn of all, and his Rival honoured before his Face, reſolved to retire to his Father to <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> who as ſome conceived, had ſent for him; and that nothing might be wanting on the Queen's part to ſhew her accuſtomed Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred at his departure, She took away all the ſilver Plate which he had uſed ever ſince he was Married, and put Pewter in their ſtead; beſides, ſhe gave him Poiſon
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:102383:144"/>
before his departure, that ſo the Evil might be more ſecret, if he died when abſent from the Court; but the Poiſon wrought ſooner than thoſe who gave it ſuppoſed it would; for he had ſcarce been gone a mile from <hi>Sterling,</hi> when ſuch a grievous Pain took him all over his Body, that it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apparent, his Diſeaſe was not uſual, but fraudulently deſign'd; but he no ſooner came to <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> but that the miſchief did manifeſtly diſcover it ſelf, for there aroſe blue Puſtules all over his Body, with ſo much Pain and Torment, that there was little hope of his Life; and when <hi>James Abernethy,</hi> an able, faithful, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Phyſician, was conſulted about his Diſtemper, he made preſent anſwer, that he had taken Poiſon: Hereupon he ſent for the Queen's Domeſtick Phyſician, but the Queen would not ſuffer him to go, fearing leſt his Skill might Cure him, and ſhe was not alſo willing that many ſhould know of his being Poiſoned. When the Ceremonies of the Baptiſm were over, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany by degrees gone home, the Queen was private with <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and ſcarce any other company at <hi>Drummond</hi> and <hi>Tullibar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> a Nobleman's Houſe, where ſhe ſpent ſome days about the beginning of <hi>January,</hi> and ſo returned to <hi>Sterling,</hi> and pretended daily to go to <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> but at the ſame time expected to hear every Minute of the Kings Death; and to prevent the worſt, ſhe reſolved to have her Son in her own

Power, and that her deſign might occaſion no ſuſpicion, they began to find fault that the Houſe wherein he was kept was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient; that in ſuch a moiſt and cold place he might be ſubject to Rheums; but the true cauſe of his removal was far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: for 'twas very plain, that the place whither he was carried, was far more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious upon the aforeſaid account, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcituated in a low marſhy Ground, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Mountain betwixt it and the Sun. riſing; whereupon the Child, ſcarce ſeven months old, was brought in a very ſharp Winter to <hi>Edenburg</hi>; but when ſhe there heard, that the King was recovered, as having overcome the Poiſon by the vigour of his Youth, and ſtrength of his Natural Conſtitution, ſhe renewed her Plot to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him, acquainting alſo ſome of the Nobility therewith. In the mean time News was brought her that the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to fly into <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> and that he had ſpoke about it to the Maſter of an Engliſh Veſſel which was then in the Frith of <hi>Clyde:</hi> Hereupon, ſome thought that an opportunity was offerred her to ſend for him, and if he refuſed to come, to kill him out of the way; yea, ſome offerred to be her Agents in the thing, and all of them adviſed that the Fact ſhould be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately committed, and that it ſhould be haſtened before he was perfectly recovered of his Illneſs. The Queen having already gotten her Son into her Poſſeſſion, that ſhe
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:102383:145"/>
might alſo have her Husband in her Power, though not as yet agreed in the deſign how he ſhould be made away, reſolved to go to <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> having, as ſhe imagined, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently cleared her ſelf from his former ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions, by many kind Letters ſhe had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent him; but her Words and Deeds were not both of a piece, for ſhe took al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt none with her in her Retinue but the <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s, and other Hereditary Enemies of the King. In the mean time ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to <hi>Bothwell</hi>'s Care to do what was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributary to the Deſign at <hi>Edenburg,</hi> for that place ſeemed moſt convenient for them to act this Helliſh Tragedy, and alſo to conceal the Fact when 'twas perpetrated. For there being a great Aſſembly of the Nobles, the ſuſpicion might be put off from one to another, and ſo divided between many. And now when the Queen had tried all the ways ſhe could to diſſemble her Hatred, at laſt by many Chidings, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and Lamentations, ſhe could yet ſcarce make him believe, that ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him; but comply he does, and ſo, though hardly yet recovered from his Sickneſs, was brought in a Litter to <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> to the fatal place deſigned for his Murther, which <hi>Bothwell,</hi> in the Queen's abſence, had undertaken to provide; and that 'twas an Houſe that had not been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited for ſome years before, near the City Walls in a loneſome ſolitary place, beneath the Ruins of two Churches, where
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:102383:146"/>
no clamour or out-cry could be heard, thither he was thruſt with a few Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants only: for the moſt of them (being ſuch as the Queen had put upon him, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Spies than Servants) were departed, as foreknowing the approaching danger; and thoſe that remained could not get the Keys of the Door from the Harbingers that provided the Lodgings.</p>
                  <p>The Queen amidſt all this Impiety, was mighty ſollicitous to have all the Suſpicion thereof averted from her ſelf, and her Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation had proceeded ſo far, that the King was now fully perſwaded there was a firm Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement between them; ſo that he ſent Letters to his Father, who ſtayd behind Sick at <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> giving him great Hopes and Aſſurance, that the Queen was now ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely his, and commemorating her many good Offices towards him, he now promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf there would be a change of all things for the better. And as he was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Letters, the Queen came in on a ſudden, and Reading of them, ſhe gave him many Kiſſes and kind Embraces, telling him withal, that ſight mightily pleaſed her, in that now ſhe diſcerned there was no Cloud of Suſpicion hovering over his Mind. Things being thus well ſecured on that ſide, her next Care was to contrive, as much as poſſible, to caſt this Guilt upon another; and therefore ſhe ſent for her Brother the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> who had lately got leave, and was going to St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> to viſit his
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:102383:146"/>
Wife, who lay there (as he heard,) dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly Ill; for beſides the danger of Child-bearing, ſhe had Puſtles, that roſe all over her Body, with a violent Feaver. The cauſe of her detaining him ſhe pretended to be, that ſhe might Honourably diſmiſs the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Ambaſſador, who came too late to the Princeſs's Baptiſm; but tho' this ſeemed a very mean pretence to take him off from ſo juſt and neceſſary a Duty, yet he obey'd; in the Interim, the Queen every Day made her Viſits to the King, and reconciled him to <hi>Bothwell,</hi> whom ſhe, by all means in the World, deſired to be out of Gun-ſhot, of any the leaſt Suſpicion: She made him large promiſes of her Affections for the future, which over Officious-carriage, thô ſuſpected by all, yet no Man was ſo bold as to adviſe the King of his danger, in regard he was wont to tell the Queen all that he heard, to Inſinuate himſelf the more into her favour; only <hi>Robert</hi> the Queen's Brother, moved either with the Horridneſs of the Fact, or with pity to the Young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, took the Boldneſs to acquaint him of his Wives plot againſt him, but on this Condition, that he would keep it to himſelf, and provide for his own ſafety, the beſt he could. But the King did for all that reveal it to the Queen, according to his Cuſtom, whereupon <hi>Robert</hi> was ſent for, but he ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny'd it, ſo that they gave one another the Lie, and were laying their Hands on their Swords; now the Queen was glad to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:102383:147"/>
ſee, that her Deſigns were likely to have ſo good a Concluſion, and therefore ſhe calls for her Brother <hi>James,</hi> as if he were to decide the Controverſie, but the Truth was, that he alſo upon that Accuſation, might be cut off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was no body elſe preſent but <hi>Bothwell,</hi> who was ſo far from keeping of them from going together by the Ears, that he would rather have killed him, that had the worſt of the Combat, as plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When this ſtirr was quieted, the Queen and <hi>Bothwell</hi> were wholly intent, how to perpetrate the Murder, and how to do it too, with all imaginary Secrecy, and that the Queen might diſſemble both Love to her Husband, and a forgiveneſs of all old Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhe cauſed her Bed to be brought from the Palace, into a Chamber below that of the Kings, where ſhe lay after ſhe had ſate up late with him in Diſcourſe, for ſome Nights.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, ſhe devizes all manner of ways to caſt the Odium of the Fact, when committed, upon her Brother <hi>James,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi>; for ſhe conceived, if thoſe two, whoſe Eſteem and Authority ſhe moſt feared and hated, were taken out of the way, all other things would fall in o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

had left the King one <hi>Paris,</hi> a French-man, and a Partizan in the Conſpiracy, entred into the King's Bed-chamber, and there ſtood ſtill, yet ſo, that the Queen might ſee him, and that was the Sign agreed on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, that all things now were in a readineſs. The Queen, as ſoon as ſhe ſaw <hi>Paris,</hi> as if <hi>Sebaſtin</hi>'s Marriage had come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Mind; ſhe began to blame her ſelf, that ſhe had been ſo negligent, as not to Dance that Night at the Wedding, as it was agreed on, and to put the Bride to Bed, as the manner is; whereupon ſhe preſently ſtarted up, and went home to her Palace, whither when ſhe came, ſhe had a pretty deal of Diſcourſe with <hi>Bothwell,</hi> who being at length diſmiſt, went into his Chamber, changed his Cloaths, put on Soldiers Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and with a few in his Company, paſſed through the Guards into the Town; two other Parties of the Conſpirators, came ſeveral ways to the appointed place, and a few of them entred into the King's Bed-Chamber, of which they had the Keys, (as I ſaid before) and whilſt he was faſt aſleep, they took him by the Throat, and Strangled him, and one alſo of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants who lay near him. When they were Slain, they carryed their Bodies through a little Gate, which they had made on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the Walls of the City, into a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den near at hand, and then they ſet Fire to the Gun-powder, which blew up the Houſe from the very Foundation, and made

ſuch a Noiſe, that it ſhook ſome of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Houſes, yea, thoſe that were faſt aſleep in the fartheſt part of the City, were awakned and frightned at the Noiſe, when the Horrid Fact was done, <hi>Bothwell</hi> was let out by the Ruins of the City Walls, and ſo returned to the Palace, through the Guard, by another way, then that he came; this was the common report of the King's Death, which held for ſome Days, and which you'll find a fuller Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of in due place.

of the Murder; neither was the Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> free from ſuſpicion; for there were ſhrew'd Conjectures againſt him, as the high and cruel enmities between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; that he was never well reconciled to the Queen, before ſhe hatch'd that Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in her Mind; and that of late, when he accompanyed her to <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> he was made acquainted with the utmoſt of her Projects. And Men's ſuſpicion were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed of him, becauſe, at that time, he had retired to his Brother's Houſe, the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> which was nigh to the Houſe where the King was Slain; whereas, before he always uſed to live at ſome eminent part of the City, where he might conveniently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Viſits, and curry favour with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by Feaſting them; and beſides Lights were ſeen in his Houſe, and a Watch all that ſame Night, from the upper part of the City, and when the Deſigned Powder Clap was given, then it was obſerved, the Lights were put out, and his Vaſſals, many of whom watched in their Arms, were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to go out of Doors. But the true Story of the Matter of Fact, which broke out after ſome Months, gave occaſion to People to look upon thoſe things, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Indications, which before were but ſuſpicions only. When the Murder was committed, the Conſpirators (as before hinted, preſently diſpatch'd Meſſengers into <hi>England,</hi> who were to report, that the King was cruelly Murdered by his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:102383:150"/>
eſpecially by the Contrivance of the Earls of <hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Morton</hi>; and the News did ſo enflame the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to a Hatred of the whole <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation, that for ſome Days, no <hi>Scotch</hi> Man durſt walk the Streets, without running the Riſque of his Life; and tho' many Letters paſt to and fro that made ſome Diſcovery of the Secret Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Deſign, yet the People would hardly be appeaſed. In the mean time, the King's Body was left for a time, as a Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to be gaz'd on, and a great concourſe of People continually flock'd to ſee it; the Queen having ordered that it ſhould be laid upon a Form or Bier, turn'd up ſide down, and brought by Porters into the Palace, where ſhe her ſelf view'd the Body, which was the moſt beautiful and comlieſt of the Age. The Nobles that were preſent deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that a Royal and Magnificent Funeral ſhould be made for him. But ſhe, good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, cauſed him to be carryed out by Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in the Night, to be buryed in no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of State; and that which increaſed the Indignity the more, was, that his Grave was made near <hi>David Rizzio</hi>'s, as if ſhe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to Sacrifice the Life of her Husband, on purpoſe to appeaſe the Ghoſt of that baſe Varlet.</p>
                  <p>There were two ſurprizing Prodigies hapning at that time, which are worthy of Relation, and were Conſtrued, as being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ominous to that poor Prince; one of them a little preceded the Murder, and thus it
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:102383:151"/>
it was; One <hi>John Londin,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Fife,</hi> having been Sick for a long time of a Fever, did the Day before the King was Murdered, about Noon, lift up himſelf a little out of his Bed, and as if he had been in great Aſtoniſhment, cry'd unto ſuch as ſtood by him, with a loud Voice, <hi>Go help the King, for the Parricides were juſt now going to Murder him.</hi> And a while after he called out with a Mournful Tone, <hi>Now 'tis too late to help, he is already Slain</hi>; and the Perſon himſelf died ſoon after; the other did accompany the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſelf. There were three of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Friends of the Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> the King's Couſin, who were Men of Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for their Valour and Fortunes, that had their Lodgings not far from the King's, who when they were aſleep about Midnight, there ſeem'd a Man to come to <hi>Dugal Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wart,</hi> who was next the Wall, and to pull his Hand over his Beard and Cheek, ſo to awake him, ſaying; <hi>Ariſe, they are offering Violence to us,</hi> upon which he preſently awakes, and conſidering of the Apparition with himſelf, another of them Cries out preſently in the ſame Bed, <hi>Who kicks me?

ſeemed to go out of the Houſe by the Door, not without ſome Noiſe. While they were deſcanting together on what they had heard and ſeen, the Noiſe of the King's Houſe, that was blown up, drove them all into a great Fright. The Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the King's Murder, and ſo did <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray,</hi> which put both of them in danger of their Lives; nay, <hi>Bothwell</hi> underſtanding that <hi>Murray</hi> was Sick at his own Houſe of the Gout, did under a pretence of Viſiting him, deſign to Murder him, as he had done before; but <hi>Murray</hi> had removed a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to his Brother <hi>Robert</hi>'s Houſe, and ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped and now the Queen and <hi>Bothwell</hi> are as unſeparable as their Shadows, and take a full ſwing of their pleaſures; but the Arrival of the French Ambaſſador, and his inſiſting how infamous the King's Murder was among Strangers, put ſome damps, upon their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; beſides, they were not a little ſollicitous, concerning the Rumours ſpread of <hi>Bothwell,</hi> being concern'd in the Fact, and how to avoid the Danger, and clear of all ſuſpicion, was now become the main Head of their Conſultation. There was a Deſign laid before, to have him try'd and acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for preſently upon the King's death, <hi>Bothwell</hi> and ſome of his Complices came to the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> who was Hereditary Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Judge in Criminal Cauſes, and firſt pretended, they were wholly ignorant of what was done, and wondered at it all as a New, unheard of, and incredible thing;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:102383:152"/>
then they proceded to the Examination of it, and to that end Summoned ſome poor Women out of the Neighbourhood, but they ſtuck between Hope and Fear, being uncertain, whether they ought to ſpeak, or hold their Peace; but tho' they were very cautious in their words, yet, uttering more then was expected, they were diſmiſt as having ſpoken nothing upon any certain Ground; and as for their Teſtimony, it was eaſie enough to diſpute it; whereupon ſome of the King's Servants, whom the Fire had not deſtroy'd, were ſent for, and being interrogated concerning the Ingreſs of the Aſſaſſines, anſwered, That the Keys were not in their Power; and it being urged on them again, in whoſe Power then? They reply'd the Queens, whereupon the further Examination was put off, as they pretended, but indeed was quite ſuppreſt, for they were afraid, if they went any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Court Secrets would become all publickly known.</p>
                  <p>And yet to ſet a Gloſs upon the Matter, a Proclamation was Publiſhed, and a Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary Reward was offered to the Diſcoverers of the King's Murder, but who durſt be ſo bold, as to Impeach <hi>Bothwell,</hi> ſeeing he was to be the impleaded, the Judge, the Examiner, and the Exacter ef the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too. Yet this fear which ſtopped the Mouths of divers ſingle Perſons, could not bridle the Multitude, for Libells were Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, Pictures made, and Night-hawkings
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:102383:152"/>
and Cries were uttered, whereby the Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides might eaſily underſtand, that their whole Deſign was diſcovered, who projected the Wicked Fact, and who was aſſiſtant to put the ſame in Execution; and the more the People were forbidden, the more did their Grief make them ſpeak; and tho' the Conſpirator ſeemed to deſpiſe theſe things, yet they were ſo inwardly prick'd and touch'd, that they could not diſſemble their Sorrow. And therefore committing the Examination about the King's Death, in which they ought to have proceeded; they fell more ſeverely and in earneſt upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gueſt, and that was againſt the Authors of Libels, or, as they called it, the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niators of the Earl of <hi>Bothwell</hi>; and this they ſo ſeverely proſecuted, that they ſpared no Pains nor Coſt the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e; and made it Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, not only to Sell, but even to Read thoſe Libells, when they were Sold; but they who endeavoured to bridle the Tongues of the People, by threatning Capital Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them, were not ſatisfied with the King's death, but ſtill retain'd their Hatred againſt him, though now in his Grave. For the Queen gave her Husbands Goods, Arms, Horſes, Apparel, and other Houſhold-ſtuff, either to his Fathers Enemies, or to the Murderers themſelves, as if they had been forfeited into her <hi>Exchequer.</hi> And as theſe matters were openly acted, ſo many did as publickly inveigh againſt them, ſo that a Taylor, who was to fit ſome of the King's
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:102383:153"/>
Cloaths for <hi>Bothwell</hi>'s Body, was ſo adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous as to ſay, now he ſaw the Old Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Cuſtom verified, that the <hi>Executioner had the Cloaths of them that ſuffered by his Hands.</hi> But tho' theſe things wrought no ſmall diſquietude to the Parricides Day by Day, yet nothing ſtuck ſo cloſe to them, as the Dayly Complaints of the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> who, though he would not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to come to Court, by Reaſon of <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s Power, accompanyed with the higheſt Luxury, yet he ſo earneſtly ſollicited the Queen by Letters, that ſhe would commit <hi>Bothwell</hi> to Priſon, who without doubt, was the Author of the King's Murder, till a Day might be appointed to bring him to a Tryal; that ſhe, tho' eluding his deſire by many Stratagems, yet ſeeing at laſt, the Examination of ſo heinous a Fact, could not be avoided, deſigned to have it carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on in this manner.</p>
                  <p>The Meeting of the Aſſembly of the Eſtates was nigh at hand, and ſhe was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous before that time, to have the Matter decided, that ſo <hi>Bothwell</hi> being abſolved by the Votes of the Judges, might be further cleared by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This haſt was the Cauſe that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was carryed in an orderly manner, or according to the Ancient Cuſtom in that Judicatory Proceſs, for the Accuſers, (as is cuſtomary,) ought to have been cited, with their Kindred, as Wife, Father, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, either to appear Perſonally, or
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:102383:153"/>
elſe by Proxy, within 40 Days, for that is the time limitted, by the Law; but here the Father was only Summoned, without Summoning any of his Friends, only his own Family, which at that time was in a low Eſtate, and reduced but to a few; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the mean time, <hi>Bothwell</hi> flew up and down the Town, with a great many Troops at his Heels, ſo that the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> thought it not adviſeable for him to come into a City full of his Enemies, where he had neither Friends nor Vaſſals, to ſecure him; and ſuppoſing there was no danger of Life, yet there could be no freedom of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; but <hi>Bothwell</hi> appeared at the Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and came into the Town-Hall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf both plaintiff and Defendant too. The Judges of the Nobility were called over, moſt of them being <hi>Bothwell</hi>'s Friends, and none daring to appear on the other ſide to accept againſt any one of them; only <hi>Robert Cunningham,</hi> one of <hi>Lennox's</hi> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, put a ſmall ſtop to the Proceedings, for he having liberty to ſpeak openly, boldly declared, the Proceſs was not according to Law nor Cuſtom: Where the Accuſed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was ſo Powerful, that he could not be brought to Puniſhment, and the Accuſer was abſent for fear of his Life; therefore whatſoever ſhould be determined there, as being againſt Law and Right, was null and void; yet, they perſiſted in their Deſign notwithſtanding. And the Iſſue of the whole was, that they declared, they ſaw
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:102383:154"/>
no reaſon to find <hi>Bothwell</hi> Guilty; yet if any man hereafter ſhould lawfully accuſe him, they gave a caution that this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be no hindrance to him; and ſome thought the Verdict was wiſely given in by them, for the Indictment was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in ſuch Words, that the ſevereſt Judges could ne'er have found <hi>Bothwell</hi> guilty upon it, for it was laid againſt a Murder committed the 9th of <hi>February,</hi> whereas the King was ſlain the 10th.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Bothwell</hi> was acquitted of the Fact, but not of the Infamy thereof, ſuſpicions ſtill increaſing upon him, and his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeemed only to be deferred; but any pretence whatſoever, though a ſhameleſs one, ſeemed good enough to the Queen, who made haſte to Marry him; but as a ſurpluſage to his Abſolution, there was a Chartel or a Challenge, poſted on the eminenteſt part of the Court, declaring, That though <hi>Bothwell</hi> was lawfully acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the King's Murder, yet to make his Innocency the more appear, he was ready to decide the matter in a Duel againſt any Gentleman, or Perſon of Honour, that ſhould dare to lay it to his Charge: Next morning there was one who did as man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully poſt up an anſwer to this bold Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, provided the place of Combate were appointed, wherein without danger he might declare his Name: But I do not find the matter proceeded any further: At the ſame time the Queen was very urgent
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:102383:154"/>
to haſten the Marriage, and yet withall ſhe deſired by any means to procure the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Conſent, that ſhe might ſeem to act nothing but by the Suffrage of the Nobles; And <hi>Bothwell</hi> too, to credit the Marriage with the colour of the publick Authority, deviſed this Stratagem. He invited all the Nobility of the higheſt Rank, that were then in Town, as there were divers of them, one Night to Supper; and when they were Jocund and Merry, he deſired they would ſhew that reſpect to him for the future, which they had always done here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore; but at preſent, his only requeſt was, that whereas he was a Suiter to the Queen, they would ſubſcribe to a Schedule which he had made about that matter, and that would be a means to procure him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the Queen, and reſpect with all the People: The Lords were all amaz'd at ſo ſudden and unexpected a motion, and could not diſſemble their Sorrow, neither yet durſt they refuſe or deny him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a few, that knew the Queen's Mind, began firſt, and the reſt, not foreſeeing that there were ſo great a number of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers there preſent, ſuſpected one another, and at laſt all ſubſcribed; but the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when they had recollected what they had done, ſome of them as ingenuouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, they would never have granted their Conſent, unleſs they thought the thing had been acceptable to the Queen; for beſides that the matter carried no great face of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:102383:155"/>
honeſty, and was prejudicial to the publick too, ſo there was danger, if any difference ſhould ariſe (as it came to paſs between her and her former Husband) between her and <hi>Bothwell</hi> alſo; and if he were rejected, it might be laid in their Diſhes that they had betrayed the Queen to a diſhonourable Marriage; and therefore before they had run too far, they reſolved to try her Mind, and to procure a Writing under her hand to this purport, that ſhe did approve of what they had done in reference to her Marriage; which Scroul was eaſily obtained, and by a joint Conſent of them all, delivered to the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> to keep. Next day all the Biſhops in the Town were called into Court, that they might alſo ſubſcribe; this care being over, another ſucceeded, which was, how the Queen might get her Son into her Power; for <hi>Bothwell</hi> did not think it ſafe for him to have a young Child brought up, who in time might Revenge his Fathers Murder, neither was he willing that any other ſhould come between his Children and the Crown; whereupon, the Queen, who could deny him nothing, undertook the task her ſelf to bring the Child to <hi>Edenburg</hi>; but when ſhe came to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Mar</hi> ſuſpected what was a brewing, and therefore ſhewed her the Prince, but would not let him be in her Power: The Queen ſeeing her fraud de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, and not able to cope with him by force, pretended another cauſe for her

Journey, and prepared to return; but on the Road, either by reaſon of her over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much Toll, or for Anger that her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, which the Authors thought craftily laid, were unſucceſsful, ſhe was taken with a ſudden illneſs, and was forced to retire to a poor Houſe about four miles from <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where her pain ſomething abating, ſhe proceeded on her Journey, and came that Night to <hi>Linlithgow</hi>; from thence ſhe wrote to <hi>Bothwell,</hi> by <hi>Paris,</hi> what ſhe would have him to do about her ſurprize; for before ſhe departed from <hi>Edenburg,</hi> ſhe had Concerted with him, that at the Bridge of <hi>Almon</hi> he ſhould ſurprize her in her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and carry her whither he pleaſed as it 'twere againſt her Will; the Cenſure of the Commonalty upon this matter was, that ſhe could not altogether conceal her Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with <hi>Bothwell,</hi> nor yet could well want it, nor could ſhe openly enjoy it as ſhe deſired it, without the loſs of her Reputation; it was too tedious to expect his Divorce from his former Wife, and ſhe was willing to conſult her Honour, which the pretended to have a very great regard unto, yet ſhe would provide for her Luſt alſo, of which ſhe was very impatient, and therefore the Device was thought to be very pretty; that <hi>Bothwell</hi> ſhould redeem the Queen's Infamy with his own great Crime, the puniſhment whereof he did not yet fear at all; but there was a deeper reach in the projected deſign, as came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:102383:156"/>
to be underſtood; for whereas the People did every where point at and curſe the King's Murderers, they to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their own ſecurity, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, as 'tis thought, of <hi>John Leſley</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Roſs,</hi> deviſed this attempt upon the Queen. 'Tis the manner in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when the King grants a Pardon for Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, that he that Sues it out expreſſes his great Offence by name, and the reſt of his Crimes are added in general Words; accordingly the King's Murderers deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ask Pardon for this ſurprize of the Queen by Name, and then to have added in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ardons by way of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, <hi>and all other wicked Facts</hi>; in which clauſe they perſuaded themſelves, that the King's Murder would be included, becauſe it was not ſafe for them to name themſelves Authors of it in the Pardon, neither would it be creditable for the Queen ſo to grant it; neither could it be well added in the grant of Pardon, as an Appendix to a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Crime; another Offence, leſs invidious, but liable to the ſame puniſhment was to be deviſed, under the ſhaddow whereof the King's Murder might be diſguiſed and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; and no other did occur to their view but this pretended force put upon the Queen, whereby her pleaſure might be ſatisfied, and <hi>Bothwell</hi>'s ſecurity provided for too; and therefore, he, with 600 Horſe, attended her coming at <hi>Almon</hi> Bridge, and carried her, by her own Conſent, to <hi>Dunbar</hi>;
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:102383:156"/>
where they had free Converſe one with another, and a Divorce was made betwixt <hi>Bothwell</hi> and his former Wife, and that in two Courts: Firſt, She was cited before Judges publickly appointed to decide ſuch Controverſies; and after that, before the Officials, or Biſhops Courts, though they were forbid by a publick Statute, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe any part of Magiſtry, or to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with any publick: Affair; ſo that Madam <hi>Gordon, Bothwell</hi>'s Wife, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to Commence a Suit of Divorce, in a double Court before the Queen's Judges; and what muſt the Accuſation be, but that her Husband was Guilty of Adultery, which was the only juſt cauſe of a Divorce amongſt them, and this before the Papal Judges, who though forbidden by the Law, yet were impowered by the Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> to determine the Controverſie: Her Allegations againſt him were, That before their Marriage, he had had too much unlawful or inceſtuous Familiarity with her Kinſwoman: The Witneſſes and Judges made no delay in the Caſe, for the Suit was commenced, proſecuted, adjudg'd and ended all in ten days.</p>
                  <p>On theſe emergent Occaſions a great many of the honeſt Nobles met at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and ſent to the Queen, deſiring to know of her, Whether ſhe was kept willingly, or againſt her Will? If the latter, they would Levy an Army for her Deliverance. It was obſerved ſhe received the Meſſage not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:102383:157"/>
Smiling, and anſwered them, that it was true, ſhe was brought thither againſt her Will, but was ſo kindly treated ever ſince, that ſhe had little cauſe to complain of the former Injury: Thus was the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger eluded; but yet, though they made all the haſte they could to take off the reflection of the force, by a lawful Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, yet there were two rubs ſtill in the way; one was, that if ſhe Married while a Priſoner, the Marriage might not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted good, and ſo eaſily diſſolved; and the other difficulty was how to have the uſual Ceremonies performed, that the Bans ſhould be publiſhed three Lord's Days in the publick Congregation, of a Marriage intended between <hi>James Hepburn</hi> and <hi>Mary Stuart,</hi> ſo that if any one knew a lawful Impediment, why they ſhould not be joined together in Matrimony, they ſhould then declare the ſame, that ſo it might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided in the Church: to bring this matter therefore about, <hi>Bothwell</hi> gathers his Friends and Dependants together, reſolving to bring back the Queen to <hi>Edenburg,</hi> that ſo under a vain ſhew of their Liberty, he might determine of their Marriage at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; To this end his Companions were all armed, but as they were on their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, a fear ſeiz'd on ſome of them, leſt at one time or other it might turn to their prejudice to detain the Queen as yet a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; and if there were no other ground for it, yet this was enough, that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:102383:157"/>
her in an armed manner, when all things were in Peace and Tranquillity, upon which ſcruple they threw away their Arms, and ſo brought her in a ſeeming more peaceable poſture to <hi>Edenburg</hi> Caſtle, which was then in <hi>Bothwell</hi>'s Power. Next day they accompanied her into the City and Courts of Juſtice, where ſhe affirmed before the Judges, that ſhe was wholly free and under no reſtraint at all; but as to the publiſhing of the Marriage in the Church, the Reader, whoſe Office it was, wholly refuſed it, which was a new Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; but upon his refuſal, the Elder Deacons and Eccleſiaſticks aſſembled, as not daring to reſiſt, and commanded the Reader to publiſh the Banes according to cuſtom; but the man was ſo bold, as plainly to tell them, that he himſelf knew a lawful Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, and was ready to declare the ſame to the Queen or to <hi>Bothwell</hi> when ever they pleaſed to Command him; whereupon he was ſent for to the Caſtle, and the Queen remitted him to <hi>Bothwell,</hi> who, with all he could do, either by fear or favour, could not divert him from his Reſolution, and yet he durſt not commit the matter to a Diſpute; yet on he went to haſten the Marriage, and there was none to be found beſides the Biſhop of <hi>Orkney</hi> to Celebrate the ſame, it was he alone that preferred Court favour before Truth; the reſt being utterly againſt it, and producing Reaſons, why it could not be a lawful Marriage
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:102383:158"/>
with a Perſon that had two Wives yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and had lately confeſt his own Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and had been alſo Divorced from a third; yet though all good Men did loath this way of procedure, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty curſed it, and even the Earls own Kindred, by Letters diſſuaded him from it, while it was in proſecution, and abhorred it when done; there were ſome publick Ceremonies diſſemblingly performed, and Married they were for all that: Thoſe of the Nobility there preſent (which were but few, and they <hi>Bothwell</hi>'s Friends and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures too, the reſt being gone to their homes) were invited to Supper, and ſo was <hi>Crocke</hi> the French Ambaſſador, who, though he were of the <hi>Guiſian</hi> Faction, and did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides dwell near the place, yet abſolutely refuſed to come, as thinking it ſuited not with the Dignity of that Perſon he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, to countenance that Marriage by his preſence, which he heard the common People did Curſe and Abominate; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the King of <hi>France,</hi> and Queen of <hi>England,</hi> did by their Ambaſſadors declare againſt the Turpitude of the thing; and though that was troubleſome to the Queen, yet the ſilent ſadneſs of the People did ſo much the more increaſe her fierce Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as things ſeen pierce deeper than things only heard. As they both went through the City, none Saluted them with wonted Acclamations, only one ſaid, and that only but once, <hi>God ſave the Queen,</hi>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:102383:158"/>
whereupon, another Woman near her ſpoke aloud once or twice, ſo as the ſtanders by might her, <hi>Let every one have what his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert is,</hi> which inraged her ſtill the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Citizens, ſo that now ſeeing the danger ſhe was in by the alienated Minds of her Subjects, ſhe caſts about how ſhe might eſtabliſh her Power, and firſt of all, ſhe determined to ſend an Ambaſſador into <hi>France,</hi> to reconcile thoſe Princes, and the <hi>Guiſes</hi> to her, whom ſhe knew were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with her precipitate Marriage, and the Biſhop of <hi>Dunblain</hi> was pitch'd upon for that purpoſe, whoſe Inſtructions were Politickly framed, and long, and no great queſtion made but they would do the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: The Biſhop, after his arrival in <hi>France,</hi> obtains a day of Audience, (not knowing that by this time <hi>Bothwell</hi> was forced to fly, and the Queen taken Priſoner, as you'l hear by and by) whereof the very ſame day the French King and his Mother had received Letters, one from <hi>Crocke</hi> the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and another from <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Cockerburn,</hi> a Scot, who had ſerved as a Captain of Horſe ſome years in <hi>France</hi>; The Scotch Ambaſſador being admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King's Preſence, made a long and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate Speech, partly to excuſe the Queens Marriage, without the advice of her Friends, and partly to commend <hi>Bothwell</hi> to the skies, beyond all Right and Reaſon; Hereupon the Queen interrupted the vain Man by ſhewing him the Letters ſhe had received
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:102383:159"/>
from <hi>Scotland,</hi> how that the Queen was made a Priſoner, and <hi>Bothwell</hi> ſted, at which ſudden ill News, the Man was aſtoniſhed, and held his Peace, whilſt thoſe that were preſent partly jeered him, and partly ſmiled at this unlook'd for accident, and there were none of them all but thought ſhe ſuffered deſervedly.</p>
                  <p>But to return to our Domeſtick Affairs, the way they projected for their ſecurity was, after they had fixed thoſe by Gifts at preſent, and Promiſes for the future, who were either Perpetrators or Partizans in the King's Murder, to make a Combination of the greater Nobility; and if that were once done, they might go on and undervalue the reſt, or cut them off, if they remained ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate; whereupon they aſſembled the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and propounded unto them, the Heads of thoſe Capitulations they were to Swear to; the Sum of the whole was, that they ſhould maintain the Queen and <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> in all their Actings, and on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, they were to Favour and Countenance the concerns of thoſe of the Confederates then preſent; a great many were perſwaded to it before, and ſo Subſcribed; the reſt perceiving it was bad to Conſpire, and as dangerous to refuſe, Subſcribed alſo. But the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> that his Authority (which was great for his Vertue,) might give ſome Countenance to the thing, was ſent for upon this occaſion; but he after all the Tamperings with him that could be, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:102383:159"/>

Both Armies being thus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalled in Battle Array, the Queen's Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noneers and Foot were driven from their Poſts by the Regents Forces; on the other hand the Regents Horſe, being fewer in number, were beat back by the Enemy; and when they had performed that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, they endeavoured alſo to break the Battalions of Foot, in order whereunto they charged directly up the Hill, but were beat back by the Archers placed there, and by ſome of thoſe who after their rout, had rallied again, and joyned with the reſt of their Body: In the mean time the Left Wing of the Enemy marched

but the Earl could not be content to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer as he pleaſed, over the King's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Subjects, but he muſt mock and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride with the ignorant multitude, the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Ambaſſadors alſo, and uſe them with all the deſpight imaginable; for it ſeems, they knowing his former meanneſs in <hi>Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> made no great Court to him, which raiſed his Fury; this was quickly percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ſome about the King, whom the Earls Practices and Inſolence had diſobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and who failed not to let the King know it; and for all the Earls Aſcendency made him ſomewhat to decline in Favour, which another accident gave a helping hand to, for Sir <hi>Francis Ruſſell,</hi> upon ſome diſorders that fell out upon the Borders, happening to be ſlain of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſide; Mr. <hi>Woton</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador, who ſtood in competition with the Earl for the King's Favour, took occaſion to lay the blame upon him, alledging that the Laird of <hi>Fernihaſt,</hi> who was Warden of the <hi>Scots</hi> Borders, had Married the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi>'s Brothers Daughter, and that the ſaid Earl had cauſed the ſlaughter to be committed, that the Borders might break looſe: <hi>Wotton</hi> was ſeconded by others in this complaint ſo effectually, that the Earl was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted priſoner to the Caſtle of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> where having remained for a few days, he got by the interceſſion of the Maſter of <hi>Gray,</hi> whom he won with fair promiſes to be his Friend, (It's ſtrange he ſhould find any,

But this was a ſorry foundation to go upon, and ſo the ſuperſtructure thus huddled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, could not laſt long, wherefore the execution of ſome, and Impriſonment of the reſt, quickly diſſipated this Cloud, and all was Serene again, and Halcion days: But here give me leave to ſay ſomewhat, as well in Vindication of the Memory of that true Engliſhman, and Noble Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> who was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:102383:198"/>
for this Conſpiracy, and Beheaded many years after, (when he had been Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral by the King's Commiſſion, and had by that, Power over the Lives of many others, contrary to the Civil Law, which ſays, <hi>He that hath Power over the Lives of others, ought to be Maſter of his own</hi>;) as to ſhew the perverſion of Juſtice in that Reign, and the poorneſs of the King's Spirit to be gull'd at that rate by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, in this, as well as other Particulars: Sir <hi>Walter</hi> was Tryed at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and made a brave Defence; All the material Evidence brought againſt him, was, the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Accuſation, which he only deſired might appear, (<hi>viva voce</hi>) and he would yield without any further Defence; but that would not be granted, for they knew full well, <hi>Cobham</hi> would not, or could not accuſe him, you muſt know, <hi>Wade,</hi> then Lieutenant of the Tower, and a great Creature of the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s, had tampered with <hi>Cobham</hi> about the aforeſaid Accuſation of <hi>Rawleigh,</hi> knowing <hi>Cobham</hi>'s weakneſs, but that would not do, and therefore he circumvented him one day, by getting of him to ſet his Name in a blank piece of Paper, and ſo filled up the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation himſelf; <hi>Salisbury, Rawleigh</hi>'s great Enemy, being thus armed againſt him, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

not know how far he might be impoſed upon, but was confident he would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him to his Face, and therefore would not put his Life upon that hazard; and thus the Trial held till nine at night; at laſt, his Fate carried him againſt his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and he yielded upon the producing his Hand, which was immediately done, (and it was in truth his Hand) but none of his Act.

The King, at the Queen's Requeſt, as in Juſtice he could do no leſs, ſent ſix Lords, <hi>viz.</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Salisbury, Worceſter, Suffolk,</hi> Sir <hi>George Carew,</hi> and Sir <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> to Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate with <hi>Cobham</hi> upon the ſaid Head; <hi>Cobham</hi> proteſted he never did nor could accuſe Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> but ſaid, That Villain <hi>Wade,</hi> after a long Sollicitation ſo to do, but not prevailing, got him by a trick to write his Name upon a piece of Paper, which he dreaming of no harm, did, ſo
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:102383:199"/>
that if any Charge came under his Hand, it muſt have been forged by <hi>Wade,</hi> by Writing ſomething above his Name, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Conſent or Privity; The Lords returning to the King, made <hi>Salisbury</hi> their Spokeſman, who eluſively ſaid, <hi>Sir, My Lord</hi> Cobham <hi>hath made good all that ever he ſaid</hi>; and ſo the matter reſted, Sir <hi>Walter</hi> being no ways relieved hereby, but the King further poſſeſt with his guilt; but ſurely the baſeneſs of thoſe Lords, and the King's credulity, were unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Crimes.</p>
                  <p>Soon after this Hodge-podge of a Plot, the King and Queen were Crowned in great Pomp at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>; And the ſame year a Conference was managed at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> between the Prelatical and Puritan Party, the latter conceiving great hopes, that becauſe of the King's Education in the <hi>Scots</hi> Diſcipline, he would be of their ſide, but they miſtook quite their mark, for he was by that time become Heart and Soul Epiſcopal, and to give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Demonſtration of his entire Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, iſſues out a Proclamation, (of which no Prince was ever ſo prodigal, and which at laſt, as naturally happens, were as little regarded) for Uniformity in Religion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law Eſtabliſhed; then at length comes a Parliament, between whom and the King, notwithſtanding ſome mutual Careſſes for a time, aroſe ſeveral Jars and Jealouſies, but the diſcovery of the Gun-Powder

Treaſon attributed to the King's Wiſdom and Foreſight, ſeemed for a time to heal all the Breaches; which helliſh Contrivance againſt the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, will fall pertinently enough to be noted in this place. The Popiſh Party finding their Petition for a Toleration of Religion rejected, grew enraged thereat, and now nothing would ſerve but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of King, Prince, and the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative Body of the whole Nation in Parliament; and to that end they hid 36 Barrels of Gun-Powder under the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Houſe; the principal Contriver whereof was <hi>Robert Catesby,</hi> a Gentleman of a plentiful Eſtate, who made choice of <hi>Thomas Piercy, Winter Grant, Ambroſe Rookwood,</hi> (I am told, the Anceſtor of the late <hi>Ambroſe Rookwood</hi> executed for Conſpiring the Death of our Renowned Sovereign King <hi>William) Wright, Treſham,</hi> Sir <hi>Everard Digby,</hi> and others, who are all bound to Secreſie by thoſe Sacraments which are the greateſt Ties upon the Soul, and St. <hi>Garnet,</hi> the Jeſuit, was their Confeſſor: <hi>Piercy</hi> was to hire the Cellars under the Parliament Houſe, to lay Wood and Coals in for his Winters Store, and <hi>Guido Faux,</hi> a deſperate Ruffian, (who was to give Fire to the Train) was appointed to be his Man to bring in Wood and Coals; The Gun-Powder bought in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> was brought in the Night from <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>

hand of an immature fate; However, it were the manner of the Prince's death was variouſly rumour'd, ſome ſaying he was poiſon'd with a bunch of Grapes, others with the venemous ſcent of a pair of Gloves preſented to him; and ſome again, that a French Phyſician gave him poiſon; and it was obſerved, that poiſon was never more in faſhion than at this time; but ſurely there was ſomething black enough in it; for when Sir <hi>Thomas Mouſon,</hi> a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who was one of the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Agents in the poiſoning of Sir <hi>Thomas Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> had paſt one days Trial at <hi>Guildhall,</hi> the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Coke</hi> vented ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, as if he could diſcover more than the death of a private Perſon, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>God knows what is become of that ſweet Babe Prince</hi> Henry, <hi>but I know ſomewhat</hi>; and bleſſing himſelf at the horror of ſuch villanies as came to his knowledge; and 'twas believed, that in ſearching the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, he had lighted on ſome Papers that ſpake plain in that which was ever whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and what ſtrongly increaſed the ſuſpicion was, that <hi>Monſon</hi>'s Trial was laid aſide, he quickly ſet at liberty, and the Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices wings clipt for ever after. And no leſs jealouſie did ſomething rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Earl of <hi>Somerſet</hi>'s Trial for the ſaid Murder of <hi>Overbury,</hi> create in Men's Minds about this matter; for when the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> according to Cuſtom,

gave <hi>Somerſet</hi> notice of his Trial next day, he abſolutely refuſed it, ſaying, <hi>They ſhould carry him in his Bed, that the King had aſſured him, he ſhould not come to any Trial, neither durſt the King bring him to any</hi>; this was an high ſtrain, and a Language not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by Sir <hi>George Moor</hi> the Lieutenant, and tho' otherwiſe eſteemed a wiſe Man, it reduced him to his Wits end; After ſome pauſes, he at laſt reſolves to go to the King, then at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> as late as it was, being Twelve a Clock at night; he bounced at the Back Stairs as if he had been mad; to whom <hi>Jo. Leveſton,</hi> one of the Grooms came out of his Bed, and enquired the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that unreaſonable diſtemper; <hi>Moor</hi> tells him he muſt ſpeak with the King im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, <hi>Loveſton</hi> anſwered, <hi>He was quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>; meaning in his Scottiſh Dialect, <hi>He was faſt aſleep,</hi> but <hi>Moor</hi> ſaid he muſt awake him, and ſo was called in and left alone with the King in his Bed-chamber, where he tells him thoſe paſſages that happened between <hi>Sommerſet</hi> and himſelf, and deſired to be directed by the King what he ſhould do; for he was gone beyond his Reaſon to hear ſuch bold and undutiful Expreſſions from a faulty Subject againſt a Juſt Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign; Hereupon the King falls into a fit of Tears, and ſaid, <hi>On my Soul,</hi> Moor, <hi>I wot not what to do, thou art a Wiſe Man, help me in this great ſtreight; and thou ſhalt
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:102383:204"/>
find thou doſt it for a faithful Maſter</hi>; with other ſad Expreſſions to the ſame purpoſe; <hi>Moor</hi> leaves the King in that Agony, but firſt aſſured him, he would ſtrain his Wits to the utmoſt for to ſerve his Majeſty, and was really rewarded with a Suit worth 1500 Pounds, tho' he was cheated of one half by a true <hi>Scot</hi> that pretended great friendſhip to him; he returned to <hi>Sommerſet</hi> about Three next Morning, which was the day he was to come to his Trial, and told him, he had been with the King; found him a moſt Affectionate Maſter, and full of Grace in his intentions towards him; but ſaid for to ſatisfy Juſtice the Earl muſt appear, tho' to return again inſtantly, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceedings againſt him; and that thereby he ſhould come to know his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and their Malice, tho' they ſhould have no power to hurt him; with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he allaid the Earl's Fury, and got him quietly about Eight in the Morning to the Hall; yet fearing his former bold Language might revert him again, and that finding himſelf thus brought within the Toye by this trick, he might be more enraged to fly into ſome ſtrange diſcovery; he took care to place two Servants on each ſide of him; every one having a Cloak on their Arms, and gave them a poſitive Command, If <hi>Sommerſet</hi> did any way fly out againſt the King, that they ſhould immediately Hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink

him with the Cloak, take him by force from the Bar and carry him away, for which he would not only ſecure them from any danger, but they ſhould be ſure of a bountiful Reward; but the Earl find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf over-reached; recollected a better temper and went on calmly in his Tryal, where he held the Court till Seven at night; but he that had ſeen the King's reſtleſs motion, and concernedneſs of Mind all that day, by his ſending to every Boat he ſaw landing at the Bridge, and curſing all that came without tidings, would have eaſily judged, all was not right, and that there were very good grounds for <hi>Sommer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet</hi>'s boldneſs; but at laſt having word brought him that he was condemned, with the particulars of the Trial, all was quiet. You may judge of the Story as you pleaſe, but my Author Sir <hi>A.

not enter upon any further narration of <hi>Overbury</hi>'s death, of the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Divorce, and her Marriage with <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> how the Diſcovery was made, how the King was made a Pimp (as he told Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>) to carry on their Bawdry and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as being not pertinent to the preſent Deſign; but acquaint you that the Lady <hi>Arabella Steward</hi> (whoſe Genealogy we have already given you) dying about this time in the <hi>Tower,</hi> ſets Mens Tongues and Fears at work that ſhe went the ſame way; ſhe had been Married ſome years before to Sir <hi>William Seymour,</hi> Son to the Lord <hi>Beauchamp,</hi> and Grandchild to <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>Hertford,</hi> and both of them being at ſome diſtance allyed to the Crown, ſuch a conjunction would not be admitted in the Royal Almanack, ſo dreadful is every Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition that comes near Princes Titles, eſpecially if they light upon jealous and weak Minds.

year of his Age, and the Two and twentieth of his Reign compleat, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than a Preſumption, that he run the ſame Deſtiny with his Anceſtors, whoſe Deaths were Violent as well by Father, as Mother's ſide, which we have more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly noted; for <hi>Henry Stuart</hi> Lord <hi>Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> his own Father, was Strangled, and carry'd out of his Houſe, and ſet under a Tree, and then his Houſe Blown up with Gunpowder; his Grandfather <hi>Matthew Stuart</hi> Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> was Shot at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> of which Wound he ſome days after died; and his Great Grandfather <hi>John Stuart</hi> Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi> was ſlain near <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict he had with the <hi>Hamiltonians</hi> and the <hi>Douglaſſes,</hi> about the Enlargement of <hi>James</hi> the Fifth.

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:102383:212"/>
was thought to be, that the King now being weary of his too much Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Power, was about to ſet up <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol,</hi> his deadly Enemy againſt him to pull him down: The Application of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine was one of the 13 Articles charged afterward upon the Duke by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who rarely accuſe upon falſe Rumour, or bare Suggeſtion; and ſurely he will have work to do that takes upon him to excuſe the King, his Succeſſor, in this Matter for Diſſolving the Parliament, to preſerve one that was accus'd by them for Poiſoning his Father; eſpecially if it be conſider'd, that the Commons had then Voted him Four Subſidies, and Four Fifteenths, which they had not time to paſs into an Act. What did farther increaſe Mens ſuſpicions, was, one Doctor <hi>Lamb</hi> (a Fellow of a moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous converſation) his frequenting to, and being much imploy'd by the Counteſs and her Son, which did at length ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe the People againſt him, that finding him in the Streets of <hi>London, An.</hi> 1628. they ſet upon him with Stones and Staves, and knocked out his Brains; as alſo one <hi>Butler</hi> an <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> that pretended to be a <hi>Chymiſt,</hi> and was very intimate with the foreſaid Company, I mean the Duke and his Mother; and indeed, the Story of his Death (as was then reported) is a very convincing Evidence of ſome ſecret Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation betwixt the Duke and him, which made the Duke be deſirous to be rid of
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:102383:213"/>
him: <hi>For Miſchief</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>Wilſon) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an ingroſſer, is unſecured, unſatisfied, when their Wares are to be vented in many Shops.</hi> This Man was, by the Dukes means, recommended, upon ſome plauſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to ſome Jeſuites beyond the Seas, where he was entertain'd with a great deal of ſpecious Ceremony and Reſpect in one of their Colleges; and at Night being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by them into his Chamber, with much Civility, which was hung with Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtry, and had Tapers burning in ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-out-Armes upon the Wall; when they gave him the <hi>Good-night,</hi> they told him, they would ſend one ſhould direct him to his Lodging; and they were no ſooner out of the Room of Death, but the Floor, that hung upon great Hinges on one ſide, was let fall by Artificial Engines, and the poor Vermine <hi>Butler</hi> dropt into a Precipice, where he was never more heard of.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, King <hi>James</hi> was Learned, and had fine Notions in Conception, but could bring but few of them into Action, tho' they tended to his Honour and Safety; for this was one of his Apothegms, which he made no timely uſe of, <hi>Let that Prince that would beware of Conſpiracies, be rather jealous of ſuch, whom his extraordinary Favours have advanc'd, then of thoſe whom his Diſpleaſure hath diſcontented; theſe want Means to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their Pleaſures, but they have means at pleaſure to execute their deſires.</hi> But a late Learned Author has expreſt as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

His Coronation at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> alter'd the Old Coronation Oath, and framed another New one for him in the room of it; it was a foul ſtumble at firſt daſh. It rarely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, and I think but very few Inſtances can be given, that one and the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon proves a Favourite to Two Princes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but, it ſeems, nothing could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Charmes of the Glorious <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who now Governs the Son more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotically than 'er he had done the Father, and put him upon thoſe very Expeditions, that, with other concurring Miſmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, made Shipwrack of His Honour at home, procured him ſcorn and contempt abroad, and haſtned thoſe Calamities, which, at length, reſolved in his own ſad Cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe and Ruine. But ſurely it argu'd a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mean and poor ſpirit in him, to take him into his Boſom, and to be govern'd by one, that had twice, in his Father's time, ſo highly affronted and diſdain'd him; the firſt at <hi>Royſton,</hi> before many People, by bidding of him, in plain terms, Kiſs his A — And the ſecond time at <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> in the ſight of about 400 Perſons, when lifting up his hand over his head with a Ballon Braſſer, and ſaying, in moſt undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful terms to him, <hi>By G. it ſhall not be ſo, you ſhall not have it</hi>; The Prince anſwer'd, <hi>What, my Lord, I think you intend to ſtrike me.</hi> It's true, to have forgotten, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to revenge ſuch Injuries when he had been King, had been worthy the Noble

Mind of a Prince; but it alſo became him never to have ſuffer'd him to come near his Court, to be upbraided with the ſight of ſo much ſcorn, that had been ſo publickly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd him: and ſome Criticks at Court at that time, did not ſtick to read his future Deſtiny. At King <hi>James</hi>'s Death the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was rent into Four Factions, <hi>viz.</hi> the Prerogative, Popiſh, Puritan, and Country Party, which, in a ſhort time, was reduc'd into two, the two former uniting their force againſt the other two; and one ſhould have thought, it had been the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the New King to have compoſed thoſe firſt, rather then make War abroad: But King <hi>James</hi> his Body was ſcarce cold, when <hi>Buckingham</hi> put King <hi>Charles</hi> upon a War with <hi>Spain.</hi> Both of them, when in that Kingdom, had receiv'd ſo many Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities from his Catholick Majeſty, that they now reſolve to Invade his Country with a Powerful Fleet, and a Land Army, under the Command of my Lord <hi>Wimbleton</hi>; but in their paſſage they met with a Furious Storm, which ſo ſcatter'd the Fleet, that of Eighty, no leſs than Fifty Ships were miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for ſeven days. But this was but the beginning of the Misfortunes of this Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Expedition, for the Confuſion of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders was ſuch, as the Officers and Soldiers ſcarce knew who to Command, or whom to Obey; ſo that when they came to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> a Conqueſt which would have paid the Charge of the Voyage, and to the Honour

of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> offer'd it ſelf; for the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Shipping in the Bay lay unprovided of defence, ſo as the ſurpriſing of them was both eaſie and feaſible; but this was neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and when the Opportunity was loſt, Sir <hi>John Burroughs</hi> Landed the Army, and took a Fort, but was forced to quit it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Diſorder and Intemperance of the Soldiers, who upon that return'd on Board again, and ſailed away for <hi>England re inſecta</hi>; which occaſion'd no ſmall cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour from the People, and eſpecially in that none was puniſhed for Miſmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But how diſhonourable ſoever this Expedition was, the King and his Miniſter loſt much more Reputation, by lending a Fleet to the <hi>French</hi> King, to beat that of the <hi>Rochellers</hi> under <hi>Monſieur Sobiez,</hi> the Great Duke of <hi>Roan</hi>'s Brother, whereby a foundation was laid to ruin the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Intereſt in <hi>France,</hi> and which all the power that e're they could afterward make, when the Tables were turned, could not relieve, though the Duke himſelf (who was much ſitter for the Delicacies of a Court, than the toyls and ſtratagems of War) was at the head of it, and periſhed by the hands of <hi>Felton</hi> at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> juſt as he was ready to Embark the ſecond time in perſon for that purpoſe.

                  <p>After the War had been manag'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and Parliament with various fortune for ſome years, and ſeveral Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſet on foot to compoſe thoſe unhappy and fatal Differences, at laſt came the fatal day wherein the Quarrel came to be decided between them at <hi>Naſeby</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thamptonſhire,</hi> which was on Saturnday <hi>June</hi> 14. 1645. Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> was the Parliaments General, and the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his own Army in Perſon; who in the beginning of the Fight prevailed, for Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> Routed the Parliaments Left Wing commanded by <hi>Ireton,</hi> but Purſuing to far left the Kings Left Wing open to be charged by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who falling furiouſly on, and the reſt Rallying, obtained a moſt abſolute Victory. But among the vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Priſoners and Horſes taken with Arms and Ammunition, that which was even a greater loſs to the King then the Battle, was, that one of his Coaches, with his Cabinets of Letters and Papers fell into the Parliaments hands, whereby his moſt Secret Counſels with the Queen, which were ſo contrary to thoſe he declared to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, were diſcovered: For in one of his Letters he declared to her, his intention to make Peace with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and to have
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:102383:216"/>
40000 of them over into <hi>England,</hi> to proſecute the War there: In others he complained, he could not prevail with his Mungrel Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> (ſo he was pleaſed to call thoſe Gentlemen who had ſtuck to him all along) to Vote that the Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> were not a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Parliament: That he would not make Peace with the Rebels (the Parliament) without her approbation, nor go one jot from the Paper She ſent him; That in the Treaty at <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge</hi> he did not poſitively own the Parliament, it being otherwiſe to be conſtru'd, tho' they were ſo ſimple as not to find it out, and it was Recorded in the Notes of the King's Council, that he did not acknowledge them a Parliament. Which Papers the Members took care to Print and Publiſh to the World, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a publick Declaration what the Nobility and Gentry who followed the King might truſt too, and I dare ſay, this ſtuck ſo cloſe in the Minds of many, that nothing contributed more to his Ruine, then this double dealing of his. Now the King's Garriſons ſurrender by heaps, <hi>Oxford</hi> was the laſt, which being blocked up by the Parliaments Forces, the King thought himſelf in no ſecurity in it; For the Parliament refuſed to admit him to come to <hi>London,</hi> unleſs he ſigned their propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherefore the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador in the <hi>Scots</hi> Quarters adviſing him to throw himſelf into the <hi>Scots</hi> Power, it was <hi>Hobſon</hi>'s

The firſt is no ſooner ask'd but granted; but the bargain for the Sale of him (and ſurely never was any King in this World ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as to be ſold by his own Subjects before himſelf) being a mighty buſineſs to the <hi>Scots,</hi> it laſted from the 5<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1646 to <hi>January</hi> following, when being concluded, the Parliament who now had a full right to him, after they had bought him, confine him to <hi>

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:102383:217"/>
manner, ſo he cannot now enjoy his own Eſtate in his own Houſe, nor has one Ship to command. Soon after this the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Army began to be jealous of each other; and the latter having no face of Authority to recur unto, the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Members in both Houſes being three to one, what do they do but ſend Cornet <hi>Joyce</hi> with a Party of Horſe on the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1647 to take the King out of the Parliaments Commiſſioners hands and to keep him in the Army; which however he might take it, was not deſigned for his advantage, tho' they ſeemed to lament the hard conditions the Members impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him not only in his Liberty, but in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him from his Children and Friends; and now they allow him both, profeſſing they would never lay down Arms until they had put the Scepter into his hands, and procured better Conditions for his Friends: And in order hereunto, they ſeem to joyn the King's Intereſts with their own, and in their Declaration for Redreſs of Grievances, declare for the King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the Members prefix a certain time for their Sitting, and charge 11 of the leading Members that had been moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to eſtabliſh the Covenant with being guilty of High Treaſon, and moſt of them fled for it. The Covenanters could not but ſee whither theſe proceedings tended, and therefore they had upon the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> ſettled the Militia of <hi>London</hi> in the hands
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:102383:218"/>
of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> but upon a Letter from the General or the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> to the Parliament, that the Militia of <hi>London</hi> might be put into the hands of Perſons better affected to the Army, the Commons tamely Submitted to it, and repealed the foreſaid Ordinance of the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May.</hi> But the City-Men in Common Counſel Petition the Commons againſt this, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting upon their own Right to diſpoſe of the Militia: The Lords upon the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Petition revoke the Ordinance of the Commons of <hi>July</hi> 23 and confirm that of the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> according to the Cities deſire, and kept back ſome of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons till the Members within had agreed to it, and enforced the Speaker to paſs a Vote that the King ſhould come to <hi>London,</hi> and ſo both Houſes Adjourned for four days. In this Interval the Members who favoured the Army, and the Speakers of both Houſes went to the Army, and there complained of the Violences put upon the Parliament; and the Houſes after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of the four days Adjournment, meet, and choſe new Speakers, and Voted, 1. That the King ſhould come to <hi>London.</hi> 2. That the Militia of <hi>London</hi> ſhould be Authoriz'd to raiſe Forces for the defence of the City. 3. That power be given to the ſame Militia to chooſe a General. 4. And that the Eleven Members Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach'd by the Army ſhould take their Seats in the Parliament. The Citizens
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:102383:218"/>
hereupon proceed to raiſe Forces, which, tho' Numerous, yet being raw and not fit to cope with an old Experienc'd and Victorious Army, they were forced to come to Terms and comply with the Army in their demands; ſo that in ſhort the Speakers and Members returned again, and recinded all that was done ſince the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> and Voted ſeveral Lords guilty of High Treaſon, and the Lord Mayor with ſeveral other Citizens were committed Priſoners to the Tower upon the ſame account. The King could not but conceive ſome hopes from theſe Broyls, that might tend to his Advantage, and indeed both Parliament and Army ſeem to Court him now, and the Parliament ſent propoſitions of Peace to him at <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Court</hi>; but <hi>Cromwel</hi> was as fearful the King ſhould agree with the Parliament as the King was unwilling to agree to them, and therefore <hi>Cormwel</hi> gave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners inſtructions, that if the King would aſſent to Propoſitions lower then thoſe of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that the Army would ſettle him again in his Throne; hereupon the King returned Anſwer to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he waved now the Propoſitions put to him, or any Treaty upon them, flies to the Propoſals of the Army, and urges a Treaty upon them, and ſuch as he ſhall make; profeſſes he will give Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, to ſettle the Proteſtant Religion, with Liberty to tender Conſciences, to
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:102383:219"/>
ſecure the Laws, Liberty and Property and Priviledges of Parliaments, and as for thoſe concerning <hi>Scotland</hi> he would Treat apart with the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners. Upon Reading of the King's Anſwer, a day was appointed by either Houſe to conſider of it, and in the mean time they order'd the ſame to be communicated to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners. It was affirmed in thoſe times that <hi>Cromwel</hi> had made a private Article with the King, that if the King cloſed with the Propoſitions of the Army, <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſhould be Advanced to a degree higher than any other, as Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and Vicar-General of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Thomas Cromwel</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> 8 time was. But it ſeems he was ſo uxorious that he would do nothing without communicating it to the Queen, and ſo wrote to her; That tho' he aſſented to the Armies Propoſals, yet if by aſſenting to them he could procure a Peace, it would be eaſier then to take of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> than now he was the head that govern'd the Army. <hi>Cromwel</hi> who had his Spies upon every motion of the King intercepts theſe Letters, and reſolved never to truſt the King again, yet doubted that he could not manage his deſigns, if the King were ſo near the Parliament and City at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi>; Therefore <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> ſent to the King that he was in no ſafety at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> by reaſon of the hatred which the Adjutators bore to him, and that he would be in more ſafty in
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:102383:219"/>
the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Wight,</hi> and ſo upon the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> at night made his eſcape, having Poſt-horſes, and a Ship provided for him at <hi>South-hampton</hi> to that purpoſe. But when he came to the Iſland he was ſecured by Collonel <hi>Hammond,</hi> who gave the Parliament notice of it, from whence the King ſent to the Members for a Perſonal Treaty of Peace at <hi>London,</hi> which after much debate was agreed to upon four Preliminaries, which the King utterly rejected, and ſo incenſed the Houſes that they Voted, that they would make no further applications or addreſſes to the King; That no other preſume to make any application to him without leave from both Houſes; That whoever Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed in that kind ſhould be guilty of High Treaſon; That they would receive no more Meſſages from the King, and that none preſume to bring any Meſſage from him to either or both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or any other Perſon. Theſe were hard lines to this unfortunate King, who now had no more to do then patiently to ſubmit to what time produced; but how pleaſing ſoever theſe Votes were to the Army, the <hi>Scots</hi> and diverſe parts of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation were not content with them, and ſo they riſe in Arms in <hi>Eſſex, Kent, Suffolk, Norfolk, Wales</hi> and the <hi>North,</hi> and declare for the King and People: Part of the Fleet alſo Revolted to Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> but all theſe Revolts were quelled by a
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:102383:220"/>
Victorious Army in a ſhort time. But while the Army was buſied abroad, the Members having gotten poſſeſſion of the Fleet, and the City of <hi>London</hi> being well affected to them, they joyn with the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners and reſcine the Votes of the Non-addreſſes to the King, and appointed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with him at <hi>Newport</hi> in the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> to continue for forty days, and to that purpoſe take him out of Priſon, and allow him the Liberty of the Iſland; and the King upon the matter with reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancy enough, grants the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the Members, their own Demands. But no endeavours of his Subjects, nor the joynt deſires of the <hi>Scots</hi> and Members, could protect this unhappy Prince from his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Ruine; for the Army now eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where Victorious over the <hi>Scots</hi> and Royaliſts, draw together, and make a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance againſt all Peace with the King, that Juſtice might be done upon Him, the Crown-land and Church-land might be ſold to Pay their Army, and that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Parliament be Diſſolved, and another Called: But the Members were intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King's Anſwer to their Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and laid aſide the Armies Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, which they take as a ſlighting of them, and then ſeized the King in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and make Him a Priſoner in <hi>Hurſt</hi>-Caſtle, an unhealthy place, and March to <hi>London,</hi> putting Garriſons in Noblemen's Houſes and <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and Poſt

the King; to Settle the Votes, that the Supream Power was in them; and the City reſolved to ſtand by them to the utmoſt: and becauſe nothing ſhould obſtruct the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Work, <hi>Hillary</hi> Term was Adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Fourteen days, and Proclamation made thereof in the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and other Market-Towns; but that this poor Prince might have ſome glimmering of hope, the <hi>Scots</hi> Parliament begun <hi>January</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> underſtanding what was done at <hi>London,</hi> in reference to the King's Tryal, Diſſent from the ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and Direct ſome Papers, <hi>To</hi> William Lenthall <hi>Eſquire, Speaker of the Houſe of Commons:</hi> which the Houſe took as an Affront and Denyal of their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſo thought not ſit to Read them, but yet Voted to ſend Commiſſioners into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to preſerve a Good Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between both Nations: Several Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, from their Pulpits, Declaimed alſo againſt the Proceedings againſt the King's Perſon; ſome of the Nobility offer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Pledges in his behalf: and <hi>January</hi> 19, the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Commiſſioners deliver'd ſome Papers, and a Declaration from the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> wherein they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a diſlike of the preſent Proceedings; and declare, That the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had an undoubted Intereſt in the King's Perſon, who was not deliver'd to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Commiſſioners at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> for the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of his Perſon, but for the more ſpeedy

Settlement of the Peace of his Kingdoms; That they extreamly Diſſented, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt the Tryal of Him, in regard of the Great Miſeries that were like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue thereupon, and deſired leave to make their Perſonal Addreſſes to Him. The like Papers were alſo Preſented to the General, but all ſignify'd nothing; for the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for the Tryal proceeded to make all things in a readineſs; and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Order'd, that the Sword and Mace, tho' they had the King's Arms thereon, ſhould be brought into the Court at His Tryal, and the King to be brought from St. <hi>James</hi>'s, where he was then a Priſoner, to Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> They erected a Tribunal, called, <hi>The High Court of Juſtice,</hi> over which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed One hundred and fifty Judges, at the upper end of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall, the Courts of <hi>Chancery</hi> and <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> being ordered into one; and theſe Judges were impower'd to Convent, Hear, Judge, and Execute <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> King of <hi>England.</hi> All things being now fitted up, the King on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 20<hi>th.</hi> was brought from St. <hi>James,</hi> through the Park in a Chair to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and from thence carried by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under a Guard to Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s Houſe at the back end of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall. the Judges in the mean time met in the <hi>Painted Chamber,</hi> attending upon their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident Serjeant <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> in his Scarlet Robe, who had the Sword born before him by
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:102383:222"/>
Col. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> the Mace by Serjeant <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> and twenty Men with Partizans for his Guard. When they came into the Court, the Preſident ſat him down in a Crimſon Velvet Chair of State, fixed in the midſt of the Court, with a Desk before him, and a Cuſhion of Crimſon Velvet thereon; and the Seats on each ſide of him were Benches covered with Scarlet-cloth: And after ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence made, the Great Gate of the Hall was ſet open for any to enter in; after which Col. <hi>Thompſon</hi> was commanded to bring forth the Priſoner, who was condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with twenty Partizans, and other Guards, and was by the Serjeant with his Mace received to the Bar, where was a Red Velvet Chair ſet for him. He looked ſternly upon the Court, and up to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, then ſat him down, but preſently got up again, and looked downward on the Guard and multitude of Spectators, not ſhewing the leaſt regard to the Court all the while; then was the Act of Parliament read over, for the Trial of <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> by the Clerk, who ſat on the right ſide of the Table, covered with a <hi>Turky</hi> Carpet placed at the feet of the Preſident, upon which lay the Sword, and Mace; and the ſeveral Names of the Judges in the Roll were called over, and Eighty anſwered to their Names. When that was over, then the King's Charge was brought, wherein he was accuſed in the Name of the People of <hi>England,</hi> of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:102383:223"/>
Tyranny, Murders, Rapines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and more eſpecially for levying War againſt the Parliament. And the Preſident ſtood up and ſaid, Sir, You have heard your Charge, containing ſuch matters as appears in it; and in the cloſe it is pray'd, that you anſwer to your Charge, which this Court expects. The King replied, By what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority did they bring him to a Trial, who was their King, againſt the Publick Faith ſo lately given him, when he commenced a Treaty with both Houſes of Parliament? Urged them to ſhew what Lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they had to call him to an account, which if they did, he would readily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, otherwiſe adviſed them to avert the Judgments that might hang over their heads for ſuch their proceedings againſt him. The Preſident rejoyned that he was called to an account by the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by whoſe Election he was admitted King: The King here inſiſts upon his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent birth-right, and that the Kingdom was Hereditary for above a thouſand years; and that he ſtood more apparently for the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the People of <hi>England</hi> by reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unlawful and arbitrary Authority, than the Judges or any other whatſoever did by aſſerting of it; That no Lords ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd there, who to conſtitute a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould have been preſent, and ſome King alſo; but that neither the one nor the other, nor both the Houſes of Parliament, nor any other Judicature on Earth had any
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:102383:223"/>
Authority to call the King of <hi>England</hi> to account, much leſs, ſome certain Judges, choſen by his accuſers, masked with the Authority of the Lower Houſe, and the ſame proculcated. However he wills them again to produce their Authority, and he would not be wanting to his Defence, for as much as it was the ſame offence with him to acknowledge a Tyrannical Power as to reſiſt a lawful one: But the Preſident made anſwer, That he was not to queſtion the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Court, that they were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with their Authority, as it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God's Authority and the Kingdom's, in doing of Juſtice, and that this was their preſent work. To which the King ſaid, That it was not his own nor their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions neither, that ought to decide it, and ſo the Preſident ordered the Priſoner to be taken into Cuſtody, and then the Court adjourned till the <hi>Monday</hi> following, being the 22. of <hi>January,</hi> to the <hi>Painted Chamber,</hi> and from thence to the ſame place again, and the King was carried back in the ſame manner as before to St. <hi>James</hi>'s. The Court accordingly met on <hi>Monday</hi> in the <hi>Painted Chamber,</hi> and there conſidering the King's Reſolution to deny the Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Court, or of that which did conſtitute it, of which debate they had no proper cognizance, nor could they being a derivative power which made them Judges, from which there was no Appeal; they therefore order, that if the King offer to
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:102383:224"/>
diſpute the ſame again, the Preſident ſhould tell him, That the Commons of <hi>England</hi> Aſſembled in Parliament, had conſtituted that Court, whoſe power might not be permitted to be diſputed by him, and that if he refuſed to anſwer, it ſhould be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Contumacy to the Court, that if he anſwered with a <hi>Salvo</hi> his pretended Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative above the Court, he ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to give a Poſitive anſwer, yea or no, that he ſhould not have a Copy of his Charge till he owned the Court, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his intentions to anſwer. This being concluded on, the King is again brought to the Bar in the ſame manner, where the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor <hi>Cook</hi> moved that the Priſoner might make a poſitive anſwer, or that the Charge might be taken <hi>pro Confeſſo,</hi> and ſo the Court proceed to Juſtice; and the Preſident did briefly repeat the paſſages of the laſt day, and commanded the King to anſwer to the Articles of Charge, unleſs he had rather hear the Capital Sentence given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. But the King ſtill perſiſted to Interrogate concerning their Authority; that he had weighty Reaſons why he ſhould not acknowledg this new form of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that they had no Law for it, and that they could not have an extraordinary Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority Delegated from the People, ſeeing they had not conſulted ſo much as every tenth Man in that matter. But the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent put him in mind of his doom, and told him the Court was abundantly ſatisfied of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:102383:224"/>
their Authority; nor were they to hear any Reaſons that ſhould detract from their Power. And when the King urged to give in his Reaſons in Writing, it would by no means be admitted; and ſo the Preſident commanded the Priſoner to be taken away.</p>
                  <p>The third Days Trial, which was <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> was in effect the ſame as the laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, in reſpect to the Court's demands, and the King's anſwer, ſo that the Court adjourned till next Morning at Ten of the Clock; but the Examination of Witneſſes, and other intervening buſineſs prevented their then ſitting, ſo that it was <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning <hi>January</hi> 27. before they aſſembled, and 68. of the Judges anſwered to their Names. As the King was brought into the Court the Soldiers cried for <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution</hi>; and the King deſired to be heard a few words, and ſo goes on to ſhew how a ſudden Judgment could not be ſoon recall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Preſident magnified the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience the Court had had towards him, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him now at length to ſubmit, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he ſhould hear the Sentence of Death reſolved on by the Court againſt him; but he ſtill refuſed to plead, and deſired he might have liberty to ſay ſome things for the good of the People before both Houſes; but the Preſident ſaid this would but delay and retard Juſtice. But the King anſwered, that he had not ſought occaſions of delay, elſe he would have made a more Elaborate conteſtation of the Cauſe, but that there
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:102383:225"/>
could be no hurt in a delay of a day or two, rather than precipitate Judgment, which might lay the Nation under perpetual Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſo deſired to withdraw, and the Court to conſider. The King was carried to <hi>Cotton</hi>-houſe, and the Judges withdrew to the Court of Wards, and in half an hour returned; and when the King inſiſted ſtill that he might be firſt heard before his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and not prevailing, the Preſident went on and ſhewed how contumacious he had been; how hateful his Crimes were, and aſſerted the Parliamentary Authority, producing Examples both Domeſtick and Foreign, eſpecially out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the People had puniſhed their Kings, and then affirmed that the Power of the People of <hi>England</hi> was not leſs over their King: That the Guilt of this King was greater than of all others, as being one who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Caligula</hi>'s wiſh, had attempted to cut off the neck of the Kingdom, by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging War againſt the Parliament; for all which he was in his Charge called Tyrant, Traytor, Murderer, and a Publick Enemy to the Commonwealth, and that it had been well if that any of thoſe terms might have been ſpared. At which words the King ſaid, <hi>How Sir</hi>; but the other went on, and argued that <hi>Rex eſt qui bene regit, Tyrannus qui populum opprimit,</hi> and ſo lodged <hi>Arbitrary Government</hi> on him which he ſought to put upon the People; That his <hi>Treaſons</hi> were his breach of truſt to the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:102383:225"/>
Kingdom, as his Superior, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called to an account, <hi>Minimus majorem in judicium vocat</hi>; That his Murders were many, as being guilty of the Blood ſhed in the War between him and his people, which could not be cleanſed, but by the Blood of him, who ſhed that Blood; he wiſhed him to have God before his Eyes, and called God to witneſs, that the Court came meerly out of the Conſcience of their Duty to that place and imployment, which they were reſolved to effect, and called for God's aſſiſtance in his Execution. Here the King made a motion to ſpeak, but was told his time was now paſt, and his Sentence was coming on, which the Preſident comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be read under this form:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whereas the Commons of</hi> England <hi>in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, have appointed them an High Court of Juſtice for the Trial of</hi> Charles Stuart <hi>King of</hi> England, <hi>before whom he had been three times Convented, and at the firſt time a Charge of High Treaſon, and other Crimes and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors was read in the behalf of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c. as in the Charge, which was read throughout; to which Charge he the ſaid</hi> Charles Stuart <hi>was required to give his Anſwer, but he refuſed ſo to do</hi>; and ſo expreſt ſeveral paſſages at his Trial, in refuſing to anſwer; <hi>for all which Treaſons and Crimes this Court doth adjudge that the ſaid</hi> Charles Stuart, <hi>as a Tyrant, Traytor, Murderer, and Publick Enemy, ſhall be put to death by ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Head from his Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:102383:226"/>And then the Preſident ſaid, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence now read and publiſhed is the Act, Sentence, Judgment and Reſolution of the whole Court; to which the Members of the Court ſtood up and aſſented, by hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their Hands. Then the King was taken away, and the Court broke up. As the King was lead along ſome of the Mobb carried it very rudely and unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly towards him; and that Night which was Saturday, <hi>January</hi> 27. he was Lodged in <hi>Whitehall,</hi> next day the Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Preached before him in his Chamber; and the ſame day the Preſident, and all the Members of the High Court of Juſtice faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Chappel at <hi>Whitehall.</hi> On <hi>Monday</hi> Morning he was conveyed to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and in the mean time Sir <hi>Hardreſs Waller,</hi> Colonel <hi>Harriſon,</hi> Colonel <hi>Dean,</hi> Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary General <hi>Ireton,</hi> and Col. <hi>Oaks</hi> were to conſider of the time and place for Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the Preſident and Judges met on <hi>Monday</hi> Morning, <hi>Jan.</hi> 29. in the <hi>Painted Chamber,</hi> who together with the Committee reſolved that the open Street before <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> was the fitteſt place; that the King ſhould be there Executed on tho next day between Ten and Two a Clock upon a Scaffold covered with Black. The King who was now apprehenſive of the approach of his fatal end, expreſt his deſires by a Member of the Army; That in regard Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death was paſt upon him, and that the time of Execution might be near,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:102383:226"/>
that he might ſee his Children, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament, and to prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for Death, and that the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> might pray with him in private in his Chamber; all which was granted him.</p>
                  <p>When the fatal day appear'd, which was Tueſday, <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. about Ten of the Clock in the Forenoon, he was called upon to come forth from St. <hi>James</hi> Palace, now his Priſon, and was Conducted on Foot over the Park to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> Guarded with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Foot; part whereof marched before, the reſt behind, with Colours fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Drums beating, his private Guard of Partizans being next him; Dr. <hi>Juxton</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> on the one ſide, and Col. <hi>Tomliſon</hi> on the other; they went up by the Stairs to the Park Gallery, and ſo into his Cabinet-Chamber, where he continued at his Devotion, and refuſed to Dine; only about Twelve-a-Clock he Eat a Bit of Bread, and drank a Glaſs of Claret. From thence he was conveyed into the Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-Houſe, and the Great Window Enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, out of which he aſcended the Scaffold, the Rails whereof were hung round, and the Floor covered with Black, with the Block and Axe ſet in the middle, and the Executioners wearing Vizzards ſtanding by: He looked round about upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who were kept a conſiderable diſtance off by the thick Guards and Troops of Horſe that beſet the Scaffold, and turning
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:102383:227"/>
to the Officers, and more particularly to Col. <hi>Tomliſon,</hi> begun with what neceſſity there lay upon him to ſay ſomewhat, leſt his ſilence might be made an argument of his guilt, and with a Proteſtation of his innocency in reference to any deſign he had to retrench the juſt Priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; yet acknowledged his puniſhment to be juſt from God, and inſtanced only in his giving way to the death of the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>; appealed to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> (who ſtood by) for his forwardneſs to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give his Enemies, yet profeſſed a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedneſs for the Weal of the Kingdom; ſhewed how the then Managers of the State were in the wrong to think to govern by the Sword, adviſed them to reſtore his Son to the Inheritance of his Anceſtors, and the People to their Rights, and due Liberties, to the abrogating of which by the enormous power of the Sword, becauſe he could by no means be induced, he was brought thither to undergo a Martyrdom for his People. Then he prayed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing minded by the Biſhop to ſatisfie the Spectators as to his Religion; he ſaid, that he had depoſited the Teſtimony of his Faith with that holy Man, meaning the Biſhop: That his Life and Profeſſion had been well known, and that now he died in the Chriſtian Faith according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the ſame was left him by his Father of Bleſſed Memory: And then turning about to the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:102383:227"/>
Officers, and profeſſing the hopes he had of his Salvation, he began to prepare for the Circumſtances of Death. The Biſhop put on his Night-cap, and uncloathed him to his Sky-coloured Sattin Waſtcoat; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his <hi>George</hi> to the Biſhop's hands, and charged him to remember to give the ſame to the Prince, and having prayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he ſtooped down to the Block, and had his Head ſevered from his Body at one Blow about Two of the Clock in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, the day aforeſaid, in the year 1648. dying the ſame death as to kind as his Grandmother <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> had done ſixty two years, and eight days before at <hi>Fothringham</hi> Caſtle in <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonſhire,</hi> and I think was no whit inferior to her in the misfortunes of his Life. And to note a few, his three Favourites, to wit, <hi>Buckingham, Laud</hi> and <hi>Strafford,</hi> undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a violent death, and the two latter falling by the Axe, as forerunners of his own deſtiny. And as to his own Perſonal errors; when <hi>Briſtol</hi> was cowardly ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by <hi>Fines,</hi> had he then marched to <hi>London,</hi> as he might have done very well, all had been his own, but loytering to no purpoſe at <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> he was ſoon after well banged by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> When he had worſted <hi>Eſſex</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> he neglected the like opportunity of getting to <hi>London.</hi> Guilty he was of the ſame overſight in not commanding the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> to march Southwards toward the Metropolis
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:102383:228"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> before the <hi>Scots</hi> entred the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Borders; and in not doing the like himſelf, after he had taken <hi>Leiceſter</hi>; for there was nothing then that could have hindred him to become Maſter of the City. The ſame ill ſucceſs he had as to his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties about being reſtored: And in ſhort, he was generally unfortunate in the World, in the eſteem not only of his Enemies, but in ſome ſort of his Friends too, for as the later were n'er pleaſed with his breach of Faith, ſo the former would ſay, he could never be faſt enough bound; and the Blood that ſome years before dropt upon his Statue at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and the falling off of the Silver Head of his Cane at his Trial, were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted as diſmal preſages of his diſaſtrous fate. His Head and Trunk after the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution were immediately put into a Coffin, and conveyed to the Lodgings in <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and there Embowelled, and from thence conveyed to St. <hi>James</hi> Houſe and Coffined in Lead. About ſome fortnight after, the Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Hartford,</hi> Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> got leave to bury the Body, which they conducted to the Chappel at <hi>Windſor,</hi> and Interred it there in the Vault of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, with this Inſcription only upon his Coffin, <hi>Charles King of England.</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was more unhappy than his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother <hi>Mary,</hi> for whereas her Corpſe were ſome years after her death taken up by her Son King <hi>James,</hi> and Repoſited with all the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:102383:228"/>
Funeral Pomp that could be, in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh her Great Grand Father. This King's Remains, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Commons, had Voted in 1669, the Sum of 50000 <hi>l.</hi> for the Charge of taking it up, a Solemn Funeral had of it, and a Monument for it, yet lay neglected, as if it had been blaſted by fate, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second his Son, they ſaid, forbidding of it. A Phyſician that made inſpection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the diſſection of the Body, related that nature had deſigned him above the moſt of mortal men for a long life, but Providence ordered it otherwiſe; for he was cut off in the Forty ninth year of his Age, being his Climacterical, and twenty fourth of his Reign; leaving ſix Children behind him, three Sons, <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales, James</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> whereof the two Elder were Exiles; and three Daughters, <hi>Mary</hi> Princeſs of <hi>Orange, Elizabeth</hi> a Virgin, who not long ſurvived him, and <hi>Henrietta Maria</hi> born at <hi>Exeter.</hi>

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:102383:229"/>
happineſs, but the Ecclipſe of the Sun which happened preſently after was no leſs a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of his future Calamities. There was little remarkable in him, or concerning him, till the year 1639, when the unhappy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter of breaking his Arm befell him; and that not long after he was afflicted with a violent Feaver, accompanied with a little of the Jaundice; but having at length reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his perfect health, and the fatal dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences begun long before, but now daily increaſing between the King his Father and the People, he accompanied him into the North of <hi>England</hi>; where he was a Spectator of that diſmall Cloud, which tho ſmall at its firſt gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet was pregnant with that dreadful ſtorm, which in a ſhort time ſpread it ſelf, over him, his Father, and three Nations: For going to take poſſeſſion of <hi>Hull,</hi> as they thought, they were by Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> denied Entrance, and forced to wait ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hours at the Gate all in vain. From this time forward the War increaſing between the King and Parliament, he was firſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator of that ſucceſsleſs Battle to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Arms at <hi>Edgehill,</hi> ſtaid ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at <hi>Oxford</hi>

To whom his Father, now depriv'd of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand himſelf, ſent a Commiſſion of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſſimo of thoſe few Royaliſts that ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the late unhappy overthrows, and this brought him to the Iſle of <hi>Guernſey</hi>; where he poſſeſt himſelf of ſome Veſſels that lay there, and having joyned them to thoſe he had brought with him out of <hi>France,</hi> he ſailed from thence into the <hi>Downs,</hi> where he ſeized ſeveral rich Merchant-Ships, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſome Land-forces from <hi>Holland,</hi> rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> for his Service. But alas, he was as unfortunate now in his Warlike attempts, as his Father had been before, and was ſtill in his Treaties of Peace; for <hi>Poyer</hi> and <hi>Langhorn,</hi> who made a riſing in <hi>Wales</hi> were ſoon beaten, ſo were the <hi>Surry, Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Forces, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reinforcements from him as was deſigned; and when he Landed ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the relief of <hi>Deal</hi>-Caſtle, they were vanquiſhed almoſt as ſoon as Landed.

In ſome time after he was ſolemnly Crowned at <hi>Scone,</hi> but alaſs it was no

To augment theſe Miſeries, the King who was very ſqueamiſh in Religion, and could not ſubmit to the rigid diſcipline of the <hi>Kirk,</hi> runs from <hi>Scone</hi> towards the High-lands, after whom ran <hi>Montgomery,</hi> promiſing, if he would return, the <hi>Kirk</hi> would remit part of the Diſcipline, and ſo he came to St. <hi>John's Town</hi>: But here was no laſting Tranquillity for him, for tho' in this time he raiſed a very numerous Army, yet the <hi>Kirkmen</hi> being beaten at <hi>Dunbar</hi> as aforeſaid by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> began to rail bitterly againſt thoſe who had called the King in too haſtily, before he had given true ſigns of Repentance, and they aſſumed the Kingly Authority ſo far, as to make ſuch Generals of the <hi>Kirk</hi> Army as they thought ſit.

The Kings fine Shirt was alſo exchanged for a courſe Canvaſs one borrowed of one <hi>Martin,</hi> and a ſuit of Cloaths anſwerable to it, of <hi>Richard Pendrells</hi> put on by him; and then he aſſumes the name and imployment of a Woodman, and ſo with <hi>Richard,</hi> with a Bill in his hand he went into the Wood, while the other Brothers went out to ſcout. It was not above an hour after his going into the Wood before a Troop of the Parliaments Horſe came to <hi>White-Ladies</hi> to look after him; But being told by the Towns-men that a Party of Horſe had been there about three hours before, but haſted away, they made no ſtay but went upon the purſuit; which being told to the King he would not adventure to come into the houſe out of the Wood all day, where he was miſerably wet with the heavy Rain that fell, and where about noon <hi>Richard's</hi> Siſter brought him a meſs of Milk, mixt with Eggs and Sugar, in a black earthen Diſh, and the King gueſſing it to be Milk and Apples, ſaid he loved it very well.

Yates</hi> their Brother-in-law went to <hi>Richard Pendrell</hi>'s Houſe, under the name of one <hi>William Jones</hi> a Wood-Cutter, newly come thither for Work, where he had Bacon and Eggs for ſupper.

As they Journyed on towards the foreſaid place he met with an odd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, which put them into no ſmall fright at a place called <hi>Eveling-Mill</hi>; for the Miller, who, as it afterward appear'd, was a Royaliſt, had then in his Houſe, ſome Conſiderable Perſons of the Kings Army, that had ſheltered themſelves there in their Flight from <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and being allarmed by <hi>Richard's</hi> ſuffering a gate to clap, through which he paſſed, and boldly demanding who was there; <hi>Richard</hi> fearing he had purſued them, quited the way in great haſt, and waded through a little Brook, and the King thereupon doing the like, followed him only by the ratling of his leathern Breeches, by which means they eſcaped the Miller, who not knowing but they were Enemies, was as glad to be rid of them, as they were to ſhun him.</p>

During his ſtay there, he conſulted with Mr. <hi>Wolf</hi> about his going into <hi>Wales,</hi> but finding upon enquiry the ſtrict guard that was kept every where, he was adviſed to retire to <hi>Boſcobel</hi> houſe, as the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired place in all thoſe parts, which he did the night following; But in the mean time his Hands and Face not appearing ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcoloured, <hi>Wolf</hi> bathed them in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Wallnut leaves, as the readieſt expedient for that purpoſe. When <hi>Richard</hi> and he came to <hi>Boſcobel,</hi> which was about three next morning, the King was left in the Wood, while <hi>Richard</hi> went in to ſee if there were any Soldiers there, and finding none but Collonel <hi>Careleſs,</hi> who was fled thither from <hi>Worceſter</hi> Fight for ſhelter, he tells him of the Kings arrival, who went immediately out to conduct him in; where he fed heartily on Coarſe Bread and Cheeſe, and a Poſſit, which as a rarity was made by <hi>William Pendrell's</hi> Wife, of thin Milk and ſmall Beer; and after Supper, his feet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extream dirty and very much gall'd with travelling, he was forced to waſh them, and for want of Shooes to wear, whilſt his own were dryed, they were neceſſitated to put hot embers into them, to dry them a little

whilſt his feet were a waſhing. After the King had refreſt himſelf, he was adviſed by the Collonel to retire to the Wood again as the ſafeſt place, where he aſcended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Collonel into an Oak, thence-forward called the <hi>Royal-Oak,</hi> where he ſtayd moſt part of the day; but in the Evening he returned back into the Houſe, and was conducted by <hi>William</hi> to the ſame place where the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been ſecured, which he liked ſo well, that he reſolved during his ſtay there to truſt to it only, and to go no more into the Oak.</p>

But the Collonel next Morning early would go to <hi>Stanton</hi>'s Sheep-Coat, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving choſen out a good Sheep, ſtuck him with his Dagger, and order'd <hi>William Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drell</hi> to carry him home; where being flead and quarter'd, and a Leg brought to the King, he called for a Knife and a Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, and having cut ſome of it into Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops, called for a Frying-pan, and Cooked ſome of them himſelf; the Collonel in the mean time, by making the Fire, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Collops in the Pan, officiating as Under-Cook.

his Face and Hands being anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereunto, made of a ruſty Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the help of the Walnut-leaves. <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſton</hi> obſerving that his Shirt, which was very coarſe, was troubleſome to him, and hinder'd him to reſt, he furniſh'd him with a better; and plucking off his Shooes and Stockings, and carefully drying his Feet, he found that ſome body had innocently put White Paper betwixt his Feet and his Stockings, which, with his Travelling on Foot from <hi>Penford</hi>-Mill to the Houſe, was ſo roll'd together, that it ſerved rather to increaſe, than aſſwage the former ſoreneſs of his Feet.

But they were no ſooner got out of this danger, then they fell into a far greater; for being to paſs through a Town, where a Troop of the Enemies Horſe was drawn up, as if on purpoſe to oppoſe their paſſage, the King was put into an horrible Fright; but the Captain thinking no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of them then honeſt Travellers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved very Civil, and Commanded his Troop to open to the Right and Left, and permitted them quietly to paſs forward; being come to a Gentleman's Houſe at <hi>Leigh,</hi> he met with a double Rencounter, one whereof, tho' he were ſurrounded with ſo many Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, made him Smile at the conceit of it, as much as the other Terrifyed him with the Apprehenſions of the Danger he might be in: Being there left in the Kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, under the Notion of a Serving-Man, the Maid happening to enter into ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him, enquired where he was Born?

Anſwer, He was Born at <hi>Brumingham,</hi> was a Nailor's Son, and had lived with Mrs. <hi>Lane</hi> about a Twelve Month. But the Jack being down, ſhe deſired him to wind it up; He being unskilful therein, went the wrong way to work, and was like to have ſpoiled the Jack; whereupon the Maid highly offended, vented her Paſſion in <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſgate</hi>-Language againſt him, asking him, Where he was Bred? and ſaying he was the moſt Ignorant Fellow ſhe ever ſaw in her life, and much more to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which made him withdraw out of the Room Smilingly: But the King find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gentleman's Houſe to be a place of great reſort, to prevent a diſcovery, feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf ſick of an Ague, and ſo kept his Chamber all day, and came down only at nights, and it being the Nature of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper to occaſion Thirſt, that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence might ſeem real, he ſometimes deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Butler to give him a Glaſs of Wine; who not only Gratified him therein, but did one Evening, when he found him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, invite him into the Cellar, and there forc'd him to drink two or three Healths, one to His Majeſty, another to His Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but at length, by ſome thing he diſcover'd in him, he began to ſuſpect him to be the King, notwithſtanding his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe; and thereupon falling on his knees, begged his Pardon, and proteſted he would be faithful to him in whatever he ſhould command him, of which (tho' he was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly

                  <p>This Paſſage made the King very unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and therefore he reſolved to haſten his going to Sea as ſoon as poſſible; but tho' there lay a little Bark there, that was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon very fit for the purpoſe, yet the Maſter could not be prevail'd upon to Tranſport a Single Perſon, which did not a little perplex him, and made him take another reſolution of going farther Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, where he was concealed at a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's Houſe about eight or ten days, in which time Preparation was made for his Paſſage into <hi>France.</hi> But coming to the place where the Veſſel was provided, he chanced to Dine with a Collonel of the Parliaments Army; and therefore fearing his Embarking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſingly might work ſome ſuſpition in him, he choſe rather to defer it, and ſo returned to the place whence he came, and from thence, after three weeks longer concealment, was conveyed through By-ways, to a Gentleman's Houſe in <hi>Suſſex</hi>; where having concealed himſelf till the Search for him was pretty well

But all that he got by it was, an entire diſappointment of his hopes that way, and they to be ſo beaten, as they were never before nor after by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet. <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> ſometime after aſſuming the Supream Power by the Title of Protector, he and <hi>Mazarine</hi> grew ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious one with another, that <hi>France</hi> began now to be too hot to hold King <hi>Charles</hi>; ſo as, he was neceſſitated to retire thence to the Elector of <hi>Cologn,</hi> and afterwards into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Netherlands; where he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Engliſh, Scots,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> in thoſe parts, which amounted to between four and five thouſand Men to joyn the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> to attempt the relief of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> then beſieged by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But herein he was as fatal in his Arms as he had been all along before; for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army were utterly routed, and this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat broke his whole deſign, ſo that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after made uſe of Arms to recover his Inheritance, but retired to <hi>Bruges</hi>; where he ſtay'd to ſee the event of things.

But there was yet ſomewhat elſe of far more dangerous conſequence to poor <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and more diſhonourable to the King, that brought the Queen-Mother over, and that was the Sale of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> whoſe Agent ſhe was in that fine ſpot of work.

the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were wont to do, and particularly <hi>Henry</hi> 8. and Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> This action I think was us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd as any can be found in our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Annals. It was indeed a Charge againſt <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> that ſhe would have transferred her Right of Succeſſion to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown to the then King of <hi>Spain Philip</hi> 2. but that if true, was giving away what was not in her power to diſpoſe of; and much ſuch another Donation as that of the Pope's to the Emperor <hi>Charles,</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Mexico,</hi> tho with a different fate to both Nations; but here was neither Donation, force, nor any viſible neceſſity, but a voluntary act in King <hi>Charles</hi> to the ineſtimable damage of <hi>England,</hi> as has been but too ſenſibly felt to this very day.</p>
                  <p>You muſt note that the gazing World ſtood a little while amazed at the ſtrange Revolution in <hi>England</hi> by the King's eaſie and pacifick Reſtoration, and with what tranſports of Joy he was received by the Nation, then in a moſt Warlike poſture, and as much dreaded by our Neighbours, and particularly by the <hi>French,</hi> who had formed deſigns for an Univerſal Monarchy: But now they were put to a ſtand to ſee what ſuch a mighty power, and apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laſting Settlement in <hi>England</hi> would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce; yet finding at length that here all thoughts of Military glory and extention of Dominion ſeemed wholly to be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and all the ſeverity of the preceding
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:102383:239"/>
times, daily degenerate to the Luxuries of an Effeminate Reign; they began to reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their former deſign, and to proſecute the foundation Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> had laid for them. But that they might make ſure work on't, and ſee that they made a true judgment of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> affairs, they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to try ſuch an Experiment as would throughly decide the matter, and what muſt that be but overtures for the buying of <hi>Dunkirk</hi>; which ſucceeding as aforeſaid, according to their wiſhes, raiſed their hopes higher than ever of attaining their ends. And becauſe they knew well enough that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were a powerful People by Sea, and that while they retained the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, it would be a hard rub in their way, they joyn their ſtrength with the <hi>Dutch</hi> to diſpute the Dominion of it with us; but the <hi>Dutch</hi> were as unfortunate in their Allyance in the firſt <hi>Dutch</hi> War, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were in the ſecond, when they joyned with them againſt the <hi>Dutch</hi>; for excepting the time that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet was divided in the firſt War, and that baſe buſineſs of burning the Ships at <hi>Chatham,</hi> ſo much to the King and Nations diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; the <hi>Dutch</hi> came by the worſt of it in all the reſt of the Engagements; and it was much the ſame luck the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had by their Conjunction in the ſecond War, the <hi>French</hi> both times ſtanding aloof as look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, and no doubt laughing in their ſleeves, to ſee the two moſt Potent Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

in the World by Sea, weaken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy one anothe whilſt they in the mean time not only ſaved their own ſtake, but learned how to fight, and doubted not but in time to run away with the prey from both of them.</p>
                  <p>The People of <hi>England</hi> were no more ſatisfied before with their imaginary happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the King's Reſtoration; but they were now, upon the ill management of Affairs, the much Treaſure that had been ſpent to ſo little purpoſe, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon our Conjunction with the <hi>French,</hi> to the manifeſt hazard of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, as well as the Civil Rights of <hi>Europe,</hi> as much uneaſie and ſuſpitious of the Court-proceedings: And it did not a little incenſe them that the <hi>French</hi> made ſuch a Progreſs in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and got all by Land, while we got nothing but Blows at Sea; and therefore the Houſe of Commons on the 31. of <hi>October</hi> 1673.

of Peace between the reſt, and the Treaty ſpun out to a very great length at <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen</hi>; and was at laſt concluded after ſome years Conferences without King <hi>Charles</hi> conſent by <hi>Beverning</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Agent; which ſpared him a labour of entring into an actual War with <hi>Franee,</hi> as the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have had him; and to which he was as unwilling as he had been before for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in his engaging againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> a Proteſtant State. The remainder of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Reign was as uneaſie to himſelf and to the Nation, upon the account firſt of the Popiſh Plot, the many endeavours to ſtiffle it, the Bill of Excluſion, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the Nation into <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Torry</hi> hereupon; then that called the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Plot, both Plots they ſaid againſt his life, (which if true, he was the more unhappy) for which laſt the Noble Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Great Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had his Throat Barbarouſly cut in the Tower of <hi>London</hi> the King's Priſon, and King <hi>Charles</hi> had the unhappineſs to be there that day, where he had not been hardly in twenty years before.

                  <p>It's certain there were ſome accidents fell out ſome time before the King's Death, that raiſed ſome Jealouſy in the breaſt of the Romaniſts; who thought by that, he would, upon the preſenting of the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity face about, as they found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience he had more then once done, and fall in with the Intereſt of a Party, he now for ſome years, by their inſtigation had been endeavouring to deſtroy and root out of the World: And what rendred their ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of him the more incurable, was, that a Pamphlet having been ſpread abroad, a little before <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> 1684. ſetting forth, that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had not cut his own Throat, but had been Murdered by Ruſſians ſet on by the Papiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the King upon the hearing of it, ſhould ſay, <hi>Well, I am reſolved to examine Eſſex</hi>'s <hi>Cauſe once more.</hi> And that he might meet with no obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the way, he ordered the Duke his Brother to prepare to go for <hi>Scotland</hi>; which the other, whether ſmelling the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, or that the train to blow the King up was already layd by him, abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to do: this occaſioned high words between them; inſomuch that the late <hi>M.</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> who was well known to be a

was to overthrow it by the introduction of his own Monkiſh Religion in the room of it: But if he was unhappy firſt in making ſuch a Promiſe of adhering to both Church and State as then Eſtabliſhed, contrary, no doubt, to the deſigns he had framed before of Ruining them; he was much more ſo in the methods he took to bring his ends about, which Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated at laſt in a fatal Abdication, yet ſo as that he remains to this day naturally alive to be a living Monument and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of his own egregious folly: And the loſs of the Button of his Scepter that day he was Crowned, which, as far as I could hear, was never found, was I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then, Interpreted by ſome, as a preſage of no laſting connection between him and the Nation.</p>

Commitment and Trial: And if the King did before decline in the affection of the People day by day; I may truly ſay, this was a concluding act, and loſt him <hi>England.</hi> For now all the Eyes of the People are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from him towards <hi>Holland,</hi> where the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was Arming to come to their relief. The King would not at firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the vaſt Preparations in <hi>Holland</hi> concerned him, tho the <hi>French</hi> King had given him notice of them the 26. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> before; but being at length convinced by the States <hi>Manifeſto</hi> of the truth of the matter, he undid in one day all that he had been doing ſince his firſt coming to the Crown; as diſſolving his Commiſſion for Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, reſtoring the City of <hi>London</hi> to all its Ancient Franchiſes and Charters, as fully as before the <hi>Quo Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto,</hi> and giving order for the reſetling the Expelled Fellows of <hi>Maudlin</hi> Colledge, in their places again: He made alſo great Preparations both by Sea and Land for to defend himſelf; but tho he be naturally ſtill alive, and he above knows, who knows all things, what his end may be; yet all theſe Precautions and windings againſt the grain, were ſo far from preventing, that they did now but concur to precipitate his Civil death, which we ſhall now briefly relate unto you.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> having on <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> the Fifth Landed his Army in <hi>Torbay,</hi> he preſently Publiſhed his Declaration, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the Cauſe of his coming. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:102383:244"/>
which ſome of the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try joyned him, and others made Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the remoter parts to declare for him. King <hi>James</hi> upon the News of the Princes Landing, ordered his Army to march Weſtward with a reſolution to follow in Perſon; But before he went, he thought it requiſite to provide for the ſafety of his darling Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> whom the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in his <hi>Manifeſto</hi> ſpread about the Kingdom ſome days before, declared upon juſt and viſible grounds, that both himſelf and all the Good People of <hi>England</hi> did vehemently ſuſpect not to be born of the Queen's Body. Wherefore ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were ſummoned (who were preſent at the pretended birth) to declare the truth upon Oath, and to have the ſame regiſtred in <hi>Chancery</hi>; but the King not daring to truſt to the validity of theſe Affadavits, which the Nation had all the reaſon in the world to ſuſpect, he ordered the Yonker to be ſent away with a ſtrong Guard to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> that if things went ill he ſhould be convey'd over into <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> proſpered in his Army, and advanced as far as <hi>Exeter,</hi> and was joyned, among mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of others that flocked in to him dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the adjacent Countries, by the Lord <hi>Cornbury</hi> with Three Regiments along with him, which he carried off from the King's Army. About this time the Prince received alſo intelligence that the Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> had declared for him in

                     <hi>Cheſhire.</hi> King <hi>James</hi> being informed of all theſe things, was horribly diſmayed, and uncertain whether he ſhould go to the Army, or no: However at length he took up a reſolution of going to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> where he began to bleed violently at the Noſe, which together with the many ill adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that befell him there, as his being forſaken by his own Daughter the Princeſs <hi>Anne,</hi> Prince <hi>George,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Grafton,</hi> the Lord <hi>Churchill,</hi> and many others who went over to the Prince then at <hi>Sherborn</hi>; all of them dangerous limbs to be loſt by him, he returned <hi>Novemb.</hi> 26. in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>London</hi>; where for an accumulation of the reſt of his Misfortunes he received an Addreſs from the Fleet for a Free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So that thinking <hi>London,</hi> nay all <hi>England</hi> now too hot to hold him; he firſt ſent his Queen and pretended Son into <hi>France,</hi> and quickly after followed himſelf. In order thereunto he put himſelf A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board a ſmall Smach, Commanded by one Captain <hi>Saunders,</hi> but was forced for ſhelter to put into <hi>Eaſtwall,</hi> the Eaſtern part of the Iſle of <hi>Sheppy,</hi> in order to the taking in of Ballaſt; where the Inhabitants of <hi>Feverſham</hi> being abroad to pick up Jeſuits, and other ſuſpected perſons, met this Veſſel; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeized it, found this wretched Prince attended only by Sir <hi>Edward Hales,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Labady</hi> therein; who not being at firſt known, were all of them but coarſly han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled by the <hi>Mobil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and Jewels he had about him, and had his Clothes rent and torn in the ſearching of him.</p>
                  <p>When the Lords at <hi>London</hi> had notice of his being at <hi>Feverſham,</hi> they ſent ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to attend him, to move him to return; but they had in the mean time made their application to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> for to aſſiſt them for the Security of the Proteſtant Religion; and ſent ſome of their number with Four Aldermen, and Eight Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to attend him at <hi>Henley.</hi> The King who was detained at <hi>Feverſham,</hi> till the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Orders came from <hi>London,</hi> did <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 15. remove to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and from thence next day being <hi>Sunday</hi> returned to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> attended once more like a King of <hi>England,</hi> with a Troop of Granadiers, and three Troops of the Life-guard. But it was only Pageant greatneſs, for a ſet of Boys only followed him through the City, and made ſome Huzza's, but the reſt of the People ſilently looked on: And here he found the Popiſh Religious houſes laid as flat to the ground as his own heart was now ſunk deep in his body. Upon his Arrival at <hi>London,</hi> and finding there no eaſe, he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Prince that he might return to <hi>Rocheſter</hi> again, which being granted readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he took his final farewell of the City, and went to the foreſaid place, where he ſtaid till the 23. of <hi>December,</hi> when about One or Two in the Morning, he privately withdrew, taking only Mr. <hi>Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

went to <hi>Dover,</hi> and there Embarkt in a Veſſel that lay ready for his Tranſportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>France</hi>; So he went out like a ſnuff in <hi>England,</hi> but ſtill retained ſome glimmering light in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the laſt of which he arrived in Perſon the <hi>March</hi> following. But his light in <hi>Scotland</hi> did not long burn, for the Convention there as well as in <hi>England,</hi> rejected him as the Violator of all their Rights; and <hi>Dundee</hi> falling by the Sword the <hi>July</hi> following 1689, together with the Surrender of <hi>Edenburg</hi> Caſtle, and other misfortunes quite extinguiſhed his hopes there. But in <hi>Ireland</hi> he had a name to live as King, till about a year after, when his Army being totally routed at the <hi>Boyn</hi> by our brave King <hi>William,</hi> he made as much haſte to get over into <hi>France,</hi> as if he had been to go to take poſſeſſion of a Crown, inſtead of running away from one. Various Struggles he made ſtill to recover a Regal Life, but he proſecuted his ends by ſuch Villanous Methods and Inſtruments, and more eſpecially by ſetting his Vile Aſſaſſins on Work to Murder the beſt of Kings, and braveſt of Men, our Lawful and Rightful Sovereign King <hi>William</hi> III. as are not to be mention'd but with utmoſt Horror; But through the goodneſs of Heaven, they have met with as little ſucceſs as the Practices have been foul and Clandeſtine; and ſo we leave him to him that made him, and withall wiſh him a far greater proportion of reſt and happy Tranquillity in the future

Here we promis'd our ſelves a laſting Tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and many happy days to come, under the benign influence of her Reign; but Alaſs, alaſs! our hopes quickly vaniſhed, our Joys faded, our Hearts failed us for fear, and ſable clouds of Deſpair overſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed our whole Iſle, by Her unexpected, by Her early, I ſay, by Her early, tho' natural Tranſition from a Corruptible to an Incorruptible Diadem: Her gain it was, but our loſs; She tho' young, yet ripe for ineffable Joys above; And we, tho' long

The laſt ſhe was, and incomparably the beſt, of the <hi>Stuarts</hi> that wore a Crown, and the Second of that number that went to Her Grave in Peace; as <hi>Robert</hi> II. who was the firſt of the <hi>Stuarts</hi> that ever was King, was the only other of the Kingly Race that did ſo: I know Mr. <hi>Coke</hi> ſays in his Character of King <hi>Charles</hi> II.
