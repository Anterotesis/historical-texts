         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Almighty God to give his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Army under my
Command: and the great deſire I have to avoyd the effuſion
of Chriſtian bloud, which makes me before I proceed any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
towards you, to make you offer of His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Grace
and Mercy, if you will ſubmit your ſelves, lay down your arms
ſo unjuſtly taken up in contempt of the Lawes of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and immediatly returne to your due Allegiance, His
<hi>Majeſtie</hi> is graciouſly pleaſed to authoriſe me to receive you
into His Favour vnd protection, which I am as willing to do,
as to reduce you by force to your Obedience if you ſhall refuſe.</p>
            <p>I cannot but wonder, whilſt you fight againſt the <hi>KING</hi>
and His Authority, you ſhould ſo boldly preſume to proffer
your ſelves for <hi>KING</hi> and Parliament, and moſt ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ſcandalize this Army with the title of Papiſts, when
we venture our Lives and fortunes for the preſervation of
the true Proteſtant Religion, eſtabliſhed in this Kingdom:</p>
            <p>Be no longer deceived, for that bloud that ſhall be ſhed in
this Quarrell, will aſſuredly fall on your own heads; I have
no other end in this, but to let you ſee your Errors if you
pleaſe, (for my Condition is ſuch, that I need not court
you) if not, let me receive your anſwer by this Meſſenger:
And this, you may expect to finde little favour, if you force
my Nature, but ſuch as is due to ſo high contemners of His

            <head>Some Obſervations upon the aforeſaid
SUMMONS.</head>
            <p>THe lofty Summons of the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> ſent to
<hi>Mancheſter,</hi> marcheth in the ſteps of the ſummons
ſent by the great <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarch to Jeruſalem;
Know ye not what I &amp; my father have done unto all the
people of other Lands? and if it conclude in the like
end, it will make good that ancient truth, a high minde
goes before a fall. But withall he aſſumes, that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to ſave the effuſion of chriſtian blood ſhould be as
notorious, as his Conqueſts; but what other buſineſſe
more then the effuſion of blood hath that perſon that
fights againſt a juſt cauſe? and againſt men more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
then he himſelfe? againſt men that deſire onely
to keepe their own; their own Religion, Liberties, and
poſſeſſions? and is it a ſigne of a ſparing blood to put
into his Army a multitude of thoſe men, who are the
ſons of that <hi>Scarlet whoore,</hi> which is drunke with the
blood of the Saints? and who are Burgeſſes of that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
wherein will be found the blood of all that are ſlain
upon the earth? and yet it ſeems to call the ſucceſſe of
ſuch a popiſh and ſcarlet Army a gift (of favour) from
Almighty God, but herein we may greatly miſtake;
ſuch ſucceſſe is indeed a chaſtiſement upon thoſe whom
God doth both covet and love: but to him and his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
it may only be ſo much favour as to make them
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53816:3"/>
rods of anger, whoſe end is commonly in the fire; It
is the very doome of heaven, upon ſuch a Rod, The
Lord of Hoaſts ſhall ſend among his fatt ones leannes,
and under his glory ſhall he kindle a burning, like the
burning of a fire.</p>
            <p>But why doth he looke ſo far as heaven, to find out a
God for his popiſh army? for they have gods nearer
at hand, even portable, manuall, and eatable gods,
which they carry in their hands, or put into their poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
or eate in their mouths; witneſſe that god of bread
which the prieſts held up in their hands before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and after eate with their mouths; and witneſſe
that golden god found in the pocket of the Earl of
<hi>Northampton;</hi> wherefore it had been more ſutable for
the head of an idolatrous and popiſh army, to have imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
the ancient Idolators the Lords of the Philiſtians,
who when they had gotten (that which the E: cals) ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
againſt <hi>Sampſon,</hi> they gathered together to offer a
great ſacrifice unto <hi>Dagon</hi> their god, and to rejoyce, for
they ſaid, our god hath delivered <hi>Sampſon</hi> our enemy
into our hand, but withall let that be remembred which
followes: the houſe fell upon the Lords, and upon all
the people that were therein, this was the cloſe of the
ſucceſſe of Idolators.</p>
            <p>And here he wanted memory or modeſty to hold
him from ſpeaking of arms, taken up in contempt of
Lawes, for had he but cal'd to minde the liſt of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
he muſt needs have remembred withall, and been
aſhamed by remembring it, that his own army was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by his own words; having plainly taken up
arms in contempt of Lawes: but no wonder if thoſe
that fight againſt the Parliament it ſelfe, do fight againſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53816:4"/>
the Lawes made by Parliament, the wonder lyes here,
that they ſhould be ſaid to fight by the Kings authority
that fight both againſt the Parliament, and Laws made
by Parliament; for if the Kings authority be greateſt
in Parliament, then they fight againſt the Kings greateſt
authority, that fight againſt the Parliament; as on the
contrary, they fight moſt for the King and his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that fight for the Parliament wherein his authority
is moſt eminent.</p>
            <p>And now he takes it unkindly that his army ſhould
be ſcandalized with this truth, that it is a popiſh army;
a truth which himſelfe hath taken ſo much paines to
make good with an apollogie, and it being beleeved
from himſelfe, that he hath a popiſh army, he could
not well lay a greater, and more true ſcandall on his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
then here he hath done; by his confuting a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
one: for he layes this ground, that papiſts cannot
fight for the preſervation of the true Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which being eaſily beleeved, it will be as ſoone
beleeved (this beleefe being advanced by his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie)
that Papiſts being imbodyed into his army,
and joyning with him in the ſuport of one and the ſame
cauſe, this cauſe c<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nnot be the preſervation of the true
Proteſtant Religion, and indeed the very ſound of the
words, aſwell as the ſence would carry an abſurdity
in the face of it, that papiſts ſhould fight for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion: But from themſelves alſo, as well as
from this argument may we know their own meaning,
in their Maſſacres (rather then Warrs) in <hi>Ireland</hi> they
profeſt to fight for the Catholique, (or Antichriſtian)
cauſe. And in their councell here, for raiſing ſums to
maintain the late Warrs againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> they profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53816:4"/>
that the War concern'd them not only as Subjects,
but as Catholikes; and now to make up a right popiſh
Warr throughout all the three Kingdoms, without
queſtion they fight (as the Earl himſelfe confeſſeth) not
for the Proteſtant Religion but for Popery; if they have
not changed their opinions in the Warr of the third
Kingdom, which they profeſt in the Warre againſt
two.</p>
            <p>And if it be ſo that his popiſh army fights for popery
againſt the Proteſtant Religion, then let him, and his
army take to themſelves, the guilt of the blood that is
ſhed in ſo ungodly and unjuſt a quarrell; blood and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols
have been ancient companions, and this Popiſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
carries the guilt of both in the bowells of it. And
it is to be beleeved that the great revenger will in his
own time execute judgment upon theſe gods, and their
worſhippers, and will avenge the blood of his Servants
which hath been ſhed upon the earth.</p>
            <p>And now he ſwels, becauſe his arme (or army) of
fleſh is ſwoln into ſome greatneſſe, and in this carnall
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence he tels them that he needs not to court them,
but to take down this ſwelling, it may be read (if it be
lawfull in a popiſh army to read Scripture) Woe to thee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that goe down to Aegipt (or Rome) for help, and ſtay
on horſes, aud truſt in charriots, becauſe they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and in horſemen, becauſe they are very ſtrong: but
they looke not to the holy one of Iſraell, neither ſeeke
the Lord. Now the Egiptians (or papiſts) are men and
not God, and their horſes fleſh, and not Spirit; when
the Lord ſhall ſtretch out his hand, both he that help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſhall fall, and he that is the holpen, and they ſhall
both fall together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:53816:5"/>
Laſtly, the Summons concludes, that if they force
his nature, no favour is to be expected: not to ſay any
thing of the nature of the ſoyle it ſelfe, but this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
that if a peece of ground be forced, husbanded,
and improved, by Romiſh Principles, or perſons, that
ground will eaſily turne into a field of blood, little fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
is to be expected from that nature, which is ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
&amp; actuated by the dragon, who was a murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
from the begining; This appeared evidently in the
Powder-treaſon, wherein ſome fair natures were forc't
into the bloudieſt and fouleſt of Treaſons; ſo a nature
needs not to be forced to cruelty by the conſtancie of
Proteſtants, that is ſo neer the leaven of Popery, and
Papiſts; but it were rather to be wiſhed that his nature
