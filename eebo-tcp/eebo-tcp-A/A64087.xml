            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T having been usual to dedicate Works of publick Use and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to great Persons, eminent for Vertue, Learning and Nobility, I think my self happy under the Obligation of that Custom; since it somewhat excuses, as well as encourages my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, to lay this Performance at your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Feet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:93814:4"/>I am sure it could not be honoured with a more agreeable Name:</p>
            <p>A Name so universally known, that all Men acknowledg your Lordship to be signally endued with those excellent Qualities, which render you not only a great Master in the most useful Parts of Learning, but likewise incline you to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Encouragement of all those who have any pretence to them. Which Favour, your Lordship having been pleased to confer on me, among se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others of greater Merit, gives me the more Confidence to address this first Volume of our English History to your Lordship's Patronage: for as no Person hath been more conversant in things of this Nature than your self; so I know none more able to make a right Judgment of them.</p>
            <p>And tho I will not affirm this to be an Exact Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story according to the strict Rules of Art, yet if I were conscious to my self, that it was wholly unworthy your Acceptance, I should derogate very much from that Respect which is so justly due to your Lordship's Character.</p>
            <p>But if the not Writing any thing which I did not believe to be true, nor the concealing any thing useful to the World, that is so, might qualify me for an Historian, perhaps then I may have some pretence to that Title. However, your Lordship will here meet with a faithful Account of all the chief Actions and Revolutions, that
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:93814:4"/>
have happened in this Kingdom down to the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man William.</hi> As first, the Conquest the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> made of that part of <hi>Britain</hi> we now call <hi>England</hi>; then their quitting it after a long Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, in order to secure their Empire at Home from the Insults of so many barbarous Nations: after which followed the calling in of the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to assist the <hi>Britains.</hi> And lastly, from the formers quarrelling with the latter, ensued their total Expulsion out of the best and most fertile parts of this Island.</p>
            <p>As for the Invasions by the <hi>Danes</hi> under King <hi>Cnute,</hi> and by the <hi>Normans</hi> under King <hi>William,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Conqueror</hi>; though it must be granted, that these Princes were victorious by their Arms, yet was not this Nation subdued by either of them so entirely, as that its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions could properly be stiled Conquests, but rather Acquisitions gained by those Princes upon certain Compacts between them and the People of <hi>England;</hi> both Parties standing obliged in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oaths, mutually to perform their parts of the Agreement, as will be clearly seen in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of this History.</p>
            <p>Yet I doubt not but in these great Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, your Lordship will take notice, that the People of this Kingdom were never overcome by Strangers, till their Luxury softning their warlike Tempers, and producing a careless Administration of their Affairs, had made them an easy Prey to their Invaders: This I observe not to reproach,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:93814:5"/>
but to warn our Nation, lest by the like Miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages they should incur the like Punishments.</p>
            <p>I have now no more, but to beg your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Acceptance of this Dedication, as a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute justly yours, by reason of those great Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, for your so freely communicating to me some part of your uncommon Knowledg, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have had the Happiness of your excellent Conversation;</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THO it hath been a general Complaint of the most Learned and Judicious Men of this Nation, that we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly wanted an exact Body of <hi>English</hi> History in our own Language, for the Instruction and Benefit of our Nobility and Gentry, together with others who would be glad to understand by it the Original Constitutions and Laws of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; yet since perhaps some ordinary Readers may be inclined to think this Work unnecessary, because it hath been already performed by so many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Hands; I shall therefore in the first Place say somewhat to obviate and remove this seeming Objection.</p>
            <p>THOSE that are any thing conversant in our Historians, do know that the Writers in <hi>English,</hi> especially of this Period now publish'd, are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. As for <hi>Caxton, Fabian,</hi> and others of less Note, (who are very short, and now read but by few) I shall pass them by, and only mention <hi>Grafton</hi> and <hi>Hollingshead,</hi> the former of whom lived in the Reign of <hi>Henry VIII.</hi> and the latter in that of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> And of these I need not say much: for tho they contain a great deal of Matter, very curious and fit to be known, especially relating to the Times wherein they lived, yet not only their dry and uncouth way of Writing, and dwelling so long on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded Fables of <hi>Geoffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> but the stuffing of their Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with divers mean and trivial Relations unworthy the Dignity of their Subject, have rendred their Labours tedious, and in a great measure unuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their Readers.</p>
            <p>BVT as for <hi>Stow</hi> and <hi>Speed,</hi> who wrote in the time of King <hi>James</hi> the First, 'tis true the former of them is not so long and tiresom in <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s Stories, as those abovementioned; and it must be confessed that Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> was the first <hi>English</hi> Writer, who, slighting <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s Tales, immediately fell upon more solid Matter; giving us a large Account of the History of this Island during the Time of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, and <hi>English Saxon</hi> Kings; and had he not, by making his Reader follow those Emperors in all their Foreign Wars and Expeditions, wherein <hi>Britain</hi> was no way concerned, he had rendred his Work less Irksome, and more Profitable than now it is.</p>
            <p>BVT notwithstanding both these Writers had many choice Collections of Noble Manuscripts relating to our <hi>English</hi> History, and might have had the View of several others if they would have been at the Pains of seeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:93814:6"/>
them; yet it must be owned they did not make that Improvement of those Opportunities as might have been expected from such great Assistances; there being not much to be found material <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>r Writer, in his Account of their Wives and Issue.</p>
            <p>AND as for those who wrote in the Time of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> viz. Mr. <hi>Daniel,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Baker;</hi> the Relations they have afforded us of those Kings, are rather short Abstracts of their Reigns, than just Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, it not being their Design to write at large of that Period we here treat of.</p>
            <p>BVT since the Restoration of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> there are several who have undertaken this Province, the first of whom was Mr. <hi>Milton;</hi> and it must be acknowledged, that he wrote this <hi>English Saxon</hi> History with Judgment, though not with that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ient <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws, and <hi>Original</hi> Constitutions of this Kingdom; he has thereby rendred that Work much more dry and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than otherwise no doubt it would have been from such a Pen as his.</p>
            <p>THE next that succeeded him in this Labour was Mr. <hi>Sammes,</hi> who had a fair Opportunity of improving his History, by amending Mr. <hi>Milton</hi>'s Omissions; but instead of this, by indulging himself too much in the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, and giving Credit to <hi>Geoffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and <hi>White</hi> (that called himself <hi>Basingstoke</hi>) their old Stories, and by making long and unnecessary Excursions on the Antiquity and Original of the <hi>Greeks, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> as likewise of their Religion and Manners (things alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether foreign to this Subject) tho he hath shewn a great deal of Reading, yet having been all the while very short in <hi>that</hi> which ought to have been the main Business of his History, he hath thereby spoiled a Noble Design.</p>
            <p>'TIS true, the Learned Dr. <hi>Howell,</hi> in the second and third Volumes of his General History, hath given us a faithful Account of the Affairs of <hi>Britain,</hi> from the Coming in of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as far as the <hi>Norman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; and hath also a very elaborate Discourse of their Civil Policy and Laws: and had that Work been done by it self, and not involved in such large Volumes, (but written in a more Chronological Method) and had he not laid the History of each Kingdom of the <hi>English Saxon</hi> Heptarchy sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and apart, which makes him often guilty of divers unnecessary Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions; that Work would have proved much more useful than now it is: which being observed by many others besides my self, hath caused a certain Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man (as I hear) to undertake the Epitomizing of that whole Work, which would be very useful to those ordinary Readers who cannot well purchase these larger Volumes.</p>
            <p>BVT since these Learned and Ingenious Authors have in some Point or other here mentioned been deficient in this Vndertaking, I found it requisite
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:93814:6"/>
(for the making a full and compleat History of the Affairs contained in this Volume) rather wholly to erect a new Edifice, than to be at the Trouble of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of theirs; and therefore have thought it necessary to draw this Work afresh from the same Originals from which they had taken theirs. To which I have also added several other material Passages, that either they wanted the Happiness of seeing, or else would not be at the Pains and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence I have been at to peruse; not but that I must own my self much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to them for divers Choice Remarks and Observations; which, not to be thought guilty of Plagiary, I have noted in the Margin by the Initial Letters of their Names; and have likewise sometimes taken their Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a few diverting Legends or Stories, to spare my self the Trouble of making them anew: and even these I have also compared with the Originals, and corrected the Stile, as well as the Sense, in divers Places.</p>
            <p>BVT I cannot here omit taking notice (among other Writers) of the first Part of Dr. <hi>Brady</hi>'s compleat History of <hi>England,</hi> which, tho it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the same Period of Time as this we now present you with; yet seeing he hath there rather chosen to give us an Account of the Political Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Laws of the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>English Saxons,</hi> than to write an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire History of those Times; I beg his Pardon, if I do not take it as to that part for so <hi>compleat a History</hi> as he is pleased to intitle it: however, it must be confessed he hath taken much Pains, and shewn a great deal of reading in that Volume; and I could have wished I might have been able to say, he had been also as careful of the just Rights and Liberties of his Country, (which he has done all he can to depress) as he has been <hi>in asserting an Imaginary Right of</hi> Lineal Succession <hi>in our Kings long before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; and that before that time as well as after, the Commons had no Representatives in Parliament</hi>; both which Assertions we shall make bold to examine in our ensuing Introduction. And (tho I have otherwise a great Value for his Learning, yet) I hope neither he himself, nor any one else who has a real Concern for the publick Good, will take it amiss if I differ from him, where the Truth of our History, as well as our Antient Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions will justify me, in contradicting some Assertions, which he has with so great an Assurance published to the World.</p>
            <p>AND thus having acquainted you with the Defects of these Writers in their several Vndertakings, and the Reasons why it was necessary to compile a new History; I shall now shew you what Method I have followed, and what Authors I have made use of, in the Performance of it.</p>
            <p>AS for the <hi>first</hi> Book, it is no other than an <hi>Epitome</hi> of <hi>Geoffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s pretended <hi>British</hi> History; and if it had not been more for the Diversion of the younger sort of Readers, and that the Work would have been thought by some others to be imperfect without it, I should have been much better satisfied in wholly omitting it; yet I hope it will neither prove te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious nor unuseful, since it may sometimes be of Advantage to know Legends as well as true History; or else which way can one tell how to pass a just Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure on them?</p>
            <p>NOR can we positively affirm, that every thing contained in that Book of his is absolutely false; for he, being a Person well vers'd in the History of his own Countrey, could not but give us all he knew concerning it, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terspersed with so many notorious Fables of his own, which he seemeth to have interwoven, the better to connect those broken Remains of old Times: But since no Man can easily at this distance distinguish Truth from
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:93814:7"/>
Falshood, he ought to be dealt with as we do with those who would impose counterfeit Coin upon us; in refusing the whole Sum, where the greatest part of it is so plainly discernable to be false.</p>
            <p>HERE by the way I must ingenuously own a small Mistake I have committed in the first Book of this Volume; where speaking somewhat in Defence of this Author, that he was not the first Inventor of the Story of <hi>Brutus,</hi> it being also found in <hi>Nennius</hi> who lived long before him, and from whom I then supposed <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntingdon</hi> to have borrowed it; I now perceive upon better Information, that <hi>Geoffrey</hi> and <hi>H. Huntingdon</hi> were not only Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries, but the latter in that part of his <hi>English</hi> History still in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript, <hi>(viz.</hi> in the Second of his Epistle, dedicated to one <hi>Gwarin</hi> a British or Welsh Nobleman) confesses, that in his Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> staying some time by the Way at the Abbey of <hi>Bec,</hi> he there found a large Book of this <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s, (whom he also calls <hi>Arthur)</hi> who had copiously and diligently wrote the <hi>British</hi> History; though in the common printed Copies we find no more, than that travelling to the Place abovementioned, he had there met with a certain Volume, in which were divers things relating to the <hi>British</hi> History not before known, but yet without naming the Author.</p>
            <p>THIS I thought good to advertise the Reader of, because those Sheets were wrought off before ever I was sensible of my Mistake.</p>
            <p>AS for my <hi>second</hi> Book, I can only tell you it is a true and just Translation of the <hi>British</hi> History from all the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Authors I could meet with that have treated of it; from whom also I have given you a Description of the Manners and Customs of the Antient <hi>Britains</hi>: and tho I grant this has been already attempted by one <hi>Daniel Rodgers,</hi> whose Papers are in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library, and is fully performed by Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> in his Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his <hi>Britannia,</hi> and likewise by Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> before his History; yet I have my self compared them with the Originals, and added some Remarks, which I thought were further necessary to be known.</p>
            <p>I have begun this Part with <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Relation, as I found it in his Commentaries concerning his two Expeditions into <hi>Britain</hi>; and have ended with the last of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Historians, viz. <hi>Zosimus, Orosius,</hi> and <hi>Aurelius Victor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND whereas others who have undertaken this Province, have used the Liberty of Epitomizing or enlarging those Passages they have cited from the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Authors; I have thought fit faithfully to translate them, except in some of their long-winded Orations; which, to avoid Prolixity, I thought it better to abridg, as not believing those Orations to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd in those Circumstances in which they are now dress'd.</p>
            <p>AND tho I do not pretend to have added much to what Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> and Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> have already collected from those Writers relating to the History of <hi>Britain</hi>; yet I hope I have from several Verses of the Poet <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> as also by the Assistance of those great Masters in Antiquity, the Lord Primate <hi>Usher,</hi> the Reverend Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> now Lord Bishop of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> now Lord Bishop of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Litchfield,</hi> not only illustrated, but settled divers things relating to that part of our Ecclesiastical, as well as Civil Affairs, not commonly taken notice of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>IN the beginning of the <hi>third</hi> Book, I have from Mr. <hi>Sheringham</hi>'s Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise <hi>De Origine Gentis Anglorum,</hi> as also from other Authors, given you, in order to our <hi>English Saxon</hi> History, a more Exact Account of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of those Nations, which (when they came over into <hi>England</hi>) were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:93814:7"/>
under the General Name of <hi>Saxons,</hi> than hath been hitherto pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in our own Language.</p>
            <p>AFTER which I have given you a Relation of the Manner of their coming over hither, and the Ground and Occasion of their quarrelling with the <hi>Britains,</hi> from <hi>Gildas, Bede</hi> and <hi>Nennius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BVT as for the Time of their erecting themselves into an <hi>Heptarchy,</hi> since it is not to be learnt from <hi>Bede,</hi> who is wholly silent of what the <hi>Saxons</hi> did here from their first entrance to the Propagation of Christianity, which he made it his Business chiefly to treat of; I have taken it from the <hi>Saxon Annals,</hi> as well as other later Authors that have mentioned any thing of it; though as to the whole Period of Time contained in this Book, it must be confessed it was when Letters were not in use amongst them, and therefore could only be convey'd down by Tradition, which makes us here be beholding to the Annals abovementioned, or to some Antient Memoirs, which tho now lost, were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly seen by those Writers, who have gathered from them.</p>
            <p>INDEED I was somewhat perplexed what Method to take in digesting the History of seven concurring Kingdoms; since, which way so ever I engaged, I found it attended with some Inconveniences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>WILLIAM</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and several other Authors, as well in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> as <hi>English,</hi> I know thought it best to give us this History digested under each respective Kingdom apart; but then there is this Exception against that way of Writing, that without Chronological Tables, or frequent turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backward and forward, one cannot understand the <hi>Synchronisms</hi> of the several Kings Reigns, or the Time wherein they lived, so as to compare them with others their Cotemporaries.</p>
            <p>BESIDES which, there is also a necessity of an unnecessary Repetition of the same Wars or Transactions, as well under the History of the King that made, as of him who suffered that Invasion; this appeareth in <hi>Speed,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Howel.</hi> 'Tis true, Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> thought of a good Method to help this, by supposing so many successive Monarchs to have been always in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> from the Time of <hi>Hengest</hi> to K. <hi>Egbert,</hi> under whose several Reigns he also reduces whatsoever Actions happened in the rest of all the other subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Kings then Regnant. This I confess had been a very good Expedient to avoid the Difficulties abovementioned, were it as just as it seems specious: but upon Examination it will be found, that tho <hi>Bede</hi> as well as the <hi>Saxon Annals,</hi> have given us a Series of all those Supream Kings, whom some of the Modern Writers are pleased to call Monarchs; yet, as I have sufficiently shewn in this ensuing History, they could by no means deserve that Title; since it may be clearly seen by any one who will peruse Mr. <hi>Speed,</hi> that there were sometimes Intervals of ten or twenty Years, before such a victorious Prince could make all the rest by the Terror of his Arms submit themselves to him; which yet they never all did till the Reign of King <hi>Egbert,</hi> without preserving entire all their Royal Rights and Prerogatives over their own Subjects.</p>
            <p>AND besides, this Power owing its Original wholly to Force, and not to a <hi>Lineal</hi> Succession or Election over the rest of those Princes upon whom it was usurped, was without any Just or Legal Right, and consequently lasted no longer than the Success, or at farthest the Life-time of such a Conquering Prince; and then it was for a time Extinct, until some other of the Seven by the like success of his Arms, could set up for the same Power and Greatness.</p>
            <p>SO that at length we found, that the best way of Writing this History was to follow the plain and natural Method of our <hi>Saxon Annals,</hi> not only as the most easy for our selves, but also for the Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:93814:8"/>AND tho perhaps an Objection may be made against this Method, <hi>viz.</hi> That the crowding of so many different Actions done in several Places, and under several Kings, renders the Work perplexed and difficult to be remembred, which I grant is in part true; yet to obviate this, I have at the end of each of the ensuing Books (except the last) presented you with exact Chronological Tables, not only of the Names of all the Kings contained under each Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, but also in what Year of our Lord they began and ended their Reigns; so that the Reader by casting his Eye upon any one of them, may easily find what Kings lived and reigned together, and consequently in which of their Reigns any Action related in the History was performed. And now,</p>
            <p>TO come to the <hi>fourth</hi> Book, <hi>Bede</hi> being the most antient Author that gives us an Account of what was done in this Period, and out of whom the <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> themselves have borrowed almost the greatest part of what they relate, concerning those early Times of Christianity; I have therefore wholly confined my self to him, without having recourse to these <hi>Annals,</hi> or any other, unless it be where I find they relate any Action of which he has been wholly silent. But in this Period, I cannot but mention <hi>Stephen Eddi,</hi> or <hi>Heddi,</hi> a Monk; who, as <hi>Bede</hi> tells, was one of the first Masters for Singing in the <hi>Northumbrian</hi> Churches; and having been invited by <hi>Wilfred</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>York</hi> out of <hi>Kent</hi> for that purpose, had so great a Veneration for his Memory, that he wrote his Life in Latin, in a Stile somewhat better than could be expected from that Age: this Treatise having continued in Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script in the Library of Sir <hi>Jo. Cotton,</hi> and also of that of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> has lately been published by the Learned Dr. <hi>Gale,</hi> in his last Volume of <hi>English</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and to which I must own my self beholding for many choice Passages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Ecclesiastical, as well as Civil State in those Times: this Author flourish'd cotemporary with <hi>Bede,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Osric</hi> King of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> and died about <hi>Anno. Dom. 720.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BVT indeed as for the last forty Years, or thereabouts, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Time when <hi>Bede</hi> ceased to write, which was <hi>Anno Dom. 637.</hi> we have been forced to make use of the <hi>Annals,</hi> or else of those of later Writers that have made any Additions to them.</p>
            <p>WHICH <hi>Annals,</hi> since I found them the Store-house, or Repository, from whence most (if not all) of our <hi>Latin</hi> Historians, as well those that wrote before, as since the Conquest, have borrowed the earliest Accounts of our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Saxon</hi> Affairs; I have by the advice of Persons of much greater Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Judgment than my self, rather chose to translate and give you them almost entire, as I find them in the Edition lately published, than to (do as most other Writers) cite them at second Hand; not that I have omitted setting down whatsoever any other Authors have added to these <hi>Annals</hi> by way of Improvement or Illustration.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE to avoid stuffing my Margins with unnecessary Quotations, I desire my Reader once for all, to observe, that wheresoever he shall find the Lines <hi>Comma'd,</hi> (unless they be before some Speeches or Laws) they always denote the <hi>Saxon Annals,</hi> whether expresly mentioned or not, as also in all other places, tho not <hi>Comma'd,</hi> where no other Writer is cited.</p>
            <p>BVT if some think I have inserted too many Names of Authors into the Body of this History, and that it had been better omitted there, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Margin, or bottom of the Pages; to this I answer, that intending faithfully to translate these <hi>Annals,</hi> and to make such frequent use of them as I have done, there could be no way to distinguish them from other Writers, but either by Letters in the Margin, or else by setting them in a different Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:93814:8"/>
But as the former would have been a constant and unsightly clog to the Margin, so the other would have looked as unhandsome in the Body, and especially at the latter end of the Work, where these <hi>Annals</hi> alone take up several whole Pages.</p>
            <p>AND tho in my Citations of Authors I have seldom quoted the Page, yet having taken what I write from those who have wrote in a Chronological Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, the Reader by turning to the Years of our Lord, may easily find what he looks for, making some small allowance for different Accounts; and where other Authors have not taken that Course, I have there quoted the Chapter or Book, and in matters of greater Moment the very Page.</p>
            <p>BVT that even the <hi>Annals</hi> themselves do vary from each other in Account of Time, often one, and sometimes two or three Years, that is to be ascribed either to the fault of the several <hi>Amanuenses,</hi> or else to the different Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations of those Monks, who drew them up in the Form we now have them, as any may easily perceive that will give himself the Trouble to compare the various Readings of the several Copies of these <hi>Annals,</hi> lately published at <hi>Oxford</hi> by the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Edmund Gibson.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the <hi>fifth</hi> and <hi>sixth</hi> Books, as I have endeavoured faithfully to translate the same <hi>Annals,</hi> so I have also used that Liberty, as not slavishly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine my self to the very Words themselves, when either the Obscurity or Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couthness of the Phrase would not bear a literal Translation, but I thought I could give them a better turn.</p>
            <p>AND here, as also in the two preceding Books, I have often added by way of Illustration to the Text, the present proper Names of Places in a Parenthesis immediately after the obsolete <hi>Saxon</hi> ones, as also the Titles of the Ealdormen, or Earls, Bishops and Abbots, out of <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and other Authors, where the <hi>Annals</hi> have only given their bare Names, without telling us to what Places they belonged; and here likewise I would note, That in all <hi>Saxon</hi> words, where the Letter <hi>(C)</hi> is made use of, it is always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced like <hi>(K),</hi> there being no <hi>K</hi> in that Language. And as for the <hi>Saxon</hi> Names of Men made use of in the <hi>Annals,</hi> I have as near as I could faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kept to the <hi>Saxon</hi> Original, tho they often differ very much in their way and manner of spelling them from that of those Latin Authors that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate them.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus given you a short Account of the several Books into which I have divided this Volume, I will now proceed to acquaint you with the rest of my Authors from whom I have collected it; nor will I give you only their Names, which has been done by so many already, but a brief Censure of them and their Works, and in what Time they wrote, being such as lived either before or after the Conquest: Of the former sort there are but few, since from <hi>Bede</hi> to <hi>Asser. Menev.</hi> there flourish'd no general Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian; for <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> himself confesses, that after <hi>Bede,</hi> all liberal Studies more and more declining, those that followed spent their Lives in Idleness or Silence: yet during even that Period, there were some Writers of this kind, <hi>viz.</hi> certain Monks in the greater Monasteries, whose business it was to set down in short, by way of <hi>Annals,</hi> the most remarkable Passages of their own Times in their own Language; nay, Learning was in that King's Reign fallen to so low an Ebb,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Append. 3. ad vit. Alfredi.</hi>
               </note> that even King <hi>Alfred</hi> tells us in his Preface to the <hi>Saxon</hi> Version of <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Pastoral, That <q>in the beginning of his Reign, there were few on this side <hi>Humber</hi> who could understand their own Prayers, much less turn a piece of <hi>Latin</hi> into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> and where then were our supposed flourishing Vniversities?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:93814:9"/>AND I shall here begin with <hi>Asserius Menevensis,</hi> who was so called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was a Monk of <hi>Menevia</hi> or <hi>St. Davids.</hi> This was he who being sent for by King <hi>Alfred</hi> out of <hi>Wales,</hi> assisted him in his Studies, and besides taught his Children, and others of the Nobility, <hi>Latin:</hi> after this King <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi> sent him with others to fetch <hi>Grimbald</hi> out of <hi>Flanders</hi> into <hi>England;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid. Gorcelin in vit. Grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldi.</hi>
               </note> and after the Schools were opened at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the latter there professed Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the former Grammar and Rhetorick, as you may find in the <hi>Annals</hi> of <hi>Hyde,</hi> cited in the ensuing History.</p>
            <p>THIS Monk, being Learned above the Age in which he lived, first wrote the <hi>Annals</hi> that go under his Name; which having long continued in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> and other Libraries in Manuscript, have been lately published by the Learned Dr. <hi>Gale,</hi> in his last Volume of Historians printed at <hi>Oxon.</hi> After these <hi>Annals,</hi> it is certain <hi>Asser</hi> also wrote the whole History of King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Life, under the Title of <hi>de Gestis Regis Aelfredi,</hi> which were first published by the Reverend Arch-bishop <hi>Parker,</hi> in <hi>Saxon</hi> Characters, according to the Copy now in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library, and was also again put out by Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> in another Edition at <hi>Frankford.</hi> But it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed there is some difference between these two Copies concerning the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> which is taken notice of in this Work in its proper Place; but that the <hi>Annals</hi> abovementioned were written before his History of King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Life,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page 491. Edit. Camden.</hi>
               </note> is plain, for he there refers you to those <hi>Annals,</hi> which he has also inserted in the Life almost word for word. But tho the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of these is continued to the Death of King <hi>Alfred,</hi> and the latter as far as the <hi>14th</hi> Year of the Reign of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Elder</hi>: yet it is evident that he himself wrote neither the one nor the other after the Year <hi>893,</hi> being the <hi>45th</hi> of King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Age; and this appears from the Life it self, in which the Author particularly mentions it, nor could he extend the <hi>Annals</hi> any farther, because they were written before he wrote the Life. This I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to let the Reader understand, that whatever he finds farther in the <hi>Annals</hi> or <hi>Life,</hi> (the Substance of both which I have given him in this Volume) were continued by some other Hand; and as for the <hi>Annals</hi> they sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it; for towards the latter end, under <hi>Anno Dom. 909.</hi> you may meet with this Passage, <hi>hoc Anno Asserius Episcopus Scireburnensis obiit,</hi> which was no other than our Author himself: yet this must be farther observed of him, that he was so extreamly negligent in his Account of Time, that he begins the first Year of King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Reign, sometimes at one Year of our Lord, and sometimes at another, so that no Man can tell by him when it commenced.</p>
            <p>BVT why he left off Writing so many Years before King <hi>Alfred</hi> died, and never finish'd his Life though he survived him nine Years, I confess I know not; unless being preferred, about the Time when he had finish'd it, to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick of <hi>Shireburne,</hi> he left the King's Service, and going to reside at his own <hi>See</hi> had other Business on his Hands than Writing. And that the same <hi>Asser</hi> who taught King <hi>Alfred,</hi> was also by him made Bishop of <hi>Shire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi> appears from this King's Preface to the <hi>Saxon</hi> Translation of St. <hi>Gregorie</hi>'s Pastoral, in which he tells you, he was assisted by <hi>Plegmund</hi> his Archbishop, and <hi>Asser</hi> his Bishop, to whom the said King in his Will, (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Archbishop and some other Bishops) bequeathed a <hi>100</hi> Marks, by the Title of <hi>Asser</hi> Bishop of <hi>Shireburne:</hi> from whence it is manifest, that the same Person who was King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Instructor, was also Bishop of <hi>Shireburne;</hi> which Bishoprick was certainly bestowed on him after he had done Writing, since tho he mentions the Abbeys of <hi>Banwell, Ambresbury,</hi> and <hi>Exceter,</hi> to
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:93814:9"/>
have been bestowed upon him by the King, yet he is utterly silent of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made Bishop, which he would not surely have omitted, if he had been then so preferred; but how long he held this Bishoprick we can say little po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively, because we do not find when it was first given him; but as for the time of his Death, not only the <hi>Annals</hi> that go under his Name, but the <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicle also, places it under <hi>Anno 909.</hi> So that I think there can be no reasonable cause to doubt of that.</p>
            <p>BVT what should lead such a careful Chronographer as <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> into so great a Mistake, as to place this Bishop's Death under <hi>Anno 883,</hi> I know not, unless he had some other Copies of the <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> by him than are now extant, but the <hi>Fasti</hi> of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings and Bishops pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd by Sir <hi>H. Savil,</hi> at the end of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and other Writers are guilty of the like Mistake, making this <hi>Asser</hi> to have succeeded <hi>Sighelm</hi> Bishop of <hi>Shireburn,</hi> and to have died <hi>Anno 883;</hi> whereas it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from our <hi>Annals,</hi> that <hi>Sighelm</hi> (whom <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> makes to be the same Person with the Bishop abovementioned) this very Year carried King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Alms to <hi>Rome,</hi>

               </note> and afterwards went himself as far as <hi>India:</hi> however this Mistake of <hi>Florence,</hi> as also the pretended Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicle, hath (as I suppose) led divers other Learned Men (and particularly Bishop <hi>Godwin,</hi> and Arch-bishop <hi>Usher</hi>) into a Belief of two <hi>Assers</hi> both Bishops, the one of whom died <hi>Anno 883,</hi> and the other to have been Arch-bishop of <hi>St. Davids,</hi> and to have succeeded <hi>Novis:</hi> who (according to the Chronicle of that Church publish'd in the <hi>2d</hi> Volume of <hi>Anglia Sacra)</hi> died <hi>Anno 872;</hi> and there immediately follows under <hi>Anno 909, Asserius Episcopus Britanniae fit,</hi> which must certainly be an Errour in the Monk that wrote this Chronicle; for <hi>Asser</hi> himself in his Life of King <hi>Alfred,</hi> tells us of <hi>Hemeid</hi> Prince of <hi>South-wales,</hi> That <hi>&amp; Nobis Archiepiscopum Propinquum meum &amp; me expulit,</hi> viz. from the Church of <hi>St. Davids:</hi> which word <hi>Nobis,</hi> the Learned Dr. <hi>Gale</hi> reads <hi>Novis,</hi> and so makes it good Sense, that otherwise seems Non-sense in the printed Copies. The false reading of which Word, as well as this Chronological mistake of <hi>Florence</hi> abovementioned,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Script. Britan. Cent. 2. cap. 25.</hi>
               </note> led <hi>Bale</hi> into the belief that the Arch-bishop above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned must have been that <hi>Asser,</hi> whom <hi>Caradoc</hi>'s Chronicle (publish'd by Dr. <hi>Powel)</hi> makes to have died <hi>Anno Dom. 906.</hi> and which Authority led the Lord Primate <hi>Usher</hi> into that small Mistake in his <hi>Index Chronologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> at the end of his <hi>Britan. Eccles. Antiquitat.</hi> of supposing this <hi>Asser</hi> to have been the Author of the History of King <hi>Alfred,</hi> and not he who was Bishop of <hi>Shireburn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND the right reading of this word <hi>Nobis</hi> in <hi>Asser,</hi> also proves the falshood of that Welsh <hi>Annal</hi> but now mentioned: for if <hi>Novis</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd his Bishoprick not long before <hi>Asser</hi> was sent for by King <hi>Alfred,</hi> which was about <hi>Anno 885.</hi> then <hi>Novis</hi> could not be dead in <hi>Anno 872.</hi> as that Chronicle makes him; nor yet could <hi>Asser</hi> succeed <hi>Novis, Anno Dom. 909.</hi> for then there would have been a Vacancy of near <hi>40</hi> Years in that See, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> rightly place the Death of our <hi>Asser</hi> Bishop of <hi>Shire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi> under this very Year.</p>
            <p>SO that upon the whole Matter, it is the Judgment of the Reverend and Learned the now Lord Bishop of <hi>Litchfield</hi> and <hi>Coventry,</hi> 
               <q>That there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was but one <hi>Asser,</hi> who was also Bishop of <hi>Shireburn;</hi> and that as for this <hi>Asser</hi> Bishop of <hi>St. Davids,</hi> he had never any Being in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but in the Brain of some ignorant Monks, who would for the Honour of their Church have made this <hi>Asser</hi> to have been Bishop, not only of
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:93814:10"/>
St. <hi>Davids,</hi> but of <hi>Britain,</hi> contrary to the Truth of all Chronology, as well as Matter of Fact.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have no more to remark of this <hi>Asser,</hi> but that <hi>Ingulph</hi> not only says he was Bishop of <hi>Shireburn,</hi> but also Abbot of <hi>Bangor,</hi> which I find not related by <hi>Asser</hi> himself, nor by any other Author; and therefore I look upon it as a Mistake either in <hi>Ingulph</hi> or his Transcriber, in writing <hi>Bangor</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of <hi>Banwell,</hi> which was one of those Abbeys that <hi>Asser</hi> says King <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi> bestowed upon him.</p>
            <p>FROM this <hi>Asser</hi> to <hi>Ethelwerd,</hi> who calls himself <hi>Quaestor, (i. e.</hi> Treasurer) and wrote in the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> being descended from the <hi>Saxon</hi> Blood-Royal by King <hi>Alfred</hi> his Great-Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there flourished no Historian; nor are we indeed so much the better for him as I could wish, for unless it be in the right settling of the Reigns and Deaths of some of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, who lived not long before him, (about which the several Copies of the <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> do differ) there is not much to be learnt from him but what is in the <hi>Annals</hi> themselves, or else in the last mentioned Author: from both which one may perceive that he had borrowed the most part of what he there writes. So that partly from the affected Obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Stile, and partly from the bad Copy from which it was printed, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is now in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library) in many Places we do not understand his meaning; but as far as we are able to do it, we have given you a true Account of what he has added to this History.</p>
            <p>BVT either from the Laziness or Ignorance of the Monks, who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most the only Writers of that Age, from the Time that <hi>Ethelwerd</hi> left off, to some Years after the Conquest, we meet with no Historians, except <hi>Osbern</hi> and another Monk, that is <hi>Anonymous;</hi> the former of whom writing the Lives of St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> and St. <hi>Alphege,</hi> has afforded us some Passages rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to this History, as has also the latter in his Life of St. <hi>Dunstan,</hi> which is still in Manuscript in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library: But as for <hi>Osbern,</hi> he is published in the first Volume of <hi>Anglia Sacra.</hi> And from these that Age gives us none, unless the Author (whose Name we know not) that wrote that short Account of the Times immediately preceding the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> called <hi>Encomium Emmae,</hi> until <hi>Ingulph</hi> Abbot of <hi>Croyland</hi> finished the History of that Abbey about the latter end of the Reign of <hi>William</hi> the <hi>First.</hi> And tho he did not take upon him to write a History of more Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs than those of his own Monastery, yet he hath by the by interspersed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny considerable Passages relating to the Publick Transactions of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which I likewise have here inserted.</p>
            <p>FROM him to <hi>Eadmerus</hi> we find no Historian; and He, only relating the Ecclesiastical History during the Reign of <hi>William</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> and his Sons <hi>William Rufus</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> is of no use to us in this Volume here published.</p>
            <p>IN the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> we find a most La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious and Diligent Chronologer, viz. <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing and enlarging the History of <hi>Marianus Scotus,</hi> hath among the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Transactions of the rest of <hi>Europe,</hi> given us at the end of almost every Year out of the <hi>Saxon Annals,</hi> an exact Account of the Affairs of <hi>England;</hi> to which he hath also added divers very curious Memoirs and Illustrations of his own: and besides what is printed, there is also in Manuscript in the <hi>Bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leian</hi> Library, a fair and perfect Copy of this Author, which once belonged to the Monastery of <hi>St. Edmundsbury,</hi> to which I have been much beholding, not only for some things concerning that Abbey, but also for several choice Passages relating to this our History, which are neither to be found in the
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:93814:10"/>
printed Editions of this Author, nor any where else that I know of; therefore where-ever the Reader shall meet with any thing cited from <hi>Florence</hi> which is not found in Print, he may be assured it is in that Manuscript, under the Year there set down in the Margin: this I mention, that the Reader may not be startled, if he does not find the Passage I cite in the printed Copies, since I had not always time to compare them together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FLORENCE</hi> was immediately followed by <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> who did not only Copy from him, but also added several Remarkable things particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly relating to the <hi>Northumbrian</hi> Kingdom, as well before as after it came under the Government of Earls. Tho Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his Preface to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem-scriptores,</hi> will not allow this <hi>Simeon</hi> to have been the Author of this Work, but that he was a Plagiary, and stole it from <hi>Turgot</hi> a Monk of the said Church, who was also afterwards ordained Bishop of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> only adding some things to it of his own, took the whole Honour to himself: his History reaches no farther than <hi>1129.</hi> but was continued by <hi>John</hi> Prior of <hi>Hagulstad</hi> to <hi>Anno 1154.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO whom we may adjoin <hi>Richard</hi> (a Monk of the same Monastery) his History of the Church of <hi>Durham,</hi> who has interspersed many excellent Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages concerning the same <hi>Northern</hi> Story. Here likewise we may add the Chronicle of the Abbey of <hi>Mailross,</hi> which tho wrote by the Abbot of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draimon,</hi> was certainly collected out of some much antienter <hi>Annals</hi> of that Monastery which was then destroyed; and these together with the last mentioned Authors, have helped us to make up the Succession of the <hi>Northumbrian</hi> Kings after <hi>Eardulf,</hi> that was expelled his Kingdom <hi>Anno 806.</hi> from whom our common Writers suppose there was an <hi>Interregnum</hi> for the space of above sixty Years, tho by those above-named it appears to have been otherwise, as you may see in the Tables at the end of the last Book.</p>
            <p>AFTER these flourished <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> who finished his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story in the Reign of King <hi>Stephen;</hi> but certainly he began it long before, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>First.</hi> To which Learned <hi>Monk,</hi> being one of the best Writers both for Judgment and Stile of that Age, I must own my self obliged for the best and choicest Passages in this Volume.</p>
            <p>TO him succeeded <hi>Henry</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Huntington,</hi> who wrote a History of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> as well before as after the Conquest, and retiring to <hi>Rome</hi> lived there for some time for that purpose. He deduced his History almost to the end of K. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and writing most commonly by way of <hi>Annals,</hi> transcribed many things out of <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester;</hi> and was of that great Reputation, that <hi>Geoffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who was his Cotemporary, recommends the <hi>English</hi> History to be written by his Pen, as he does the <hi>British</hi> to be continued by <hi>Caradoc</hi> of <hi>Lancarvon,</hi> who wrote a <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicle as far as his own Time; the Substance whereof I have here likewise given you, as it was put out by Dr. <hi>Powell,</hi> to which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so added several remarkable Passages that were designed in a new Edition of the same Work, to be published from the Manuscripts of the Learned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary Mr. <hi>Robert Vaughan,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Ellis</hi> late of <hi>Jesus</hi> College in <hi>Oxon,</hi> but which were never finished. And I have likewise inserted divers choice Notes, that I gathered from another Manuscript of the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's, relating to the Chronology and Actions of the <hi>British</hi> Princes, which he wrote for the Satisfaction of the Lord Primate <hi>Usher,</hi> and from him is now in my Possession. And I suppose no Ingenious <hi>British</hi> Antiquary will think this Performance unnecessary, since he will here find the Substance of all that is contained in <hi>Caradoc</hi>'s Chronicle, together with a great many consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:93814:11"/>
Additions from the Manuscripts abovementioned, as also some others gathered from two MS. Copies of the Chronicles of <hi>Wales,</hi> the one in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library, the other in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> written at the end of one of the Volumes of <hi>Doomesday;</hi> for the perusal of which I stand obliged to the Reverend Dr. <hi>Gale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>H. Huntingdon</hi> was followed by <hi>Rog. Hoveden</hi> a secular Priest of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and was Domestick Clerk or Secretary to <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Second;</hi> he seems to have chiefly transcribed from <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> as to the Affairs before the Conquest, as he does from <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> and other Authors, as well as his own Observations for those that occur'd afterwards to his own Time, continuing his History to the beginning of King <hi>John</hi>'s Reign.</p>
            <p>THE next we come to, are those Authors contained in that noble Volume, called the <hi>Decem-Scriptores,</hi> such as <hi>Ailred,</hi> Abbot <hi>de Rievalle,</hi> who wrote concerning the Kings of <hi>England</hi> so far as King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> in whose Time he lived; as also concerning the Life and Miracles of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> from whom I have taken divers memorable Passages relating to the Life of that King, as well as to his Predecessors, omitting his Fables and Legends in which he does too much abound.</p>
            <p>AFTER him follows <hi>Radulphus de Diceto</hi> Dean of St. <hi>Pauls, London,</hi> who flourished in the Reign of King <hi>John,</hi> about the Year <hi>1210.</hi> he was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed a very accomplished Historian, and an indefatigable Collector in his Time of things not only before, but after the Conquest.</p>
            <p>I have also taken some few Passages from <hi>William Thorn</hi> a Monk of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who wrote an entire History of the Affairs of his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery of St. <hi>Augustin</hi> down to the beginning of King <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> in whose Reign he lived.</p>
            <p>AFTER whom we had for a long time no printed Historians of the Times before the Conquest, till that in the <hi>Decem-Scriptores,</hi> which goes under the Name of <hi>John Brompton</hi> Abbot of <hi>Jorvaulx</hi> in <hi>Richmondshire;</hi> tho Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> has shewn us in his Preface to that Volume, that he was rather the Purchaser, than Author of this Chronicle, which he left to his own Abbey: he is supposed to have lived in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> but the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story concludes with the Death of <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>First.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BVT the said Reverend Dr. <hi>Gale</hi> farther observes of him, <q>That he intended to continue <hi>Geoffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> as appears in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and in Col. <hi>1153.</hi> as also that he took much from <hi>Benedictus Abbas</hi> (still in Manuscript in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library) and not from <hi>Roger Hoveden;</hi> for where a Fault or Omission is found in <hi>Benedictus,</hi> the same is here found also, but not so in <hi>Hoveden:</hi> e. g. <hi>Benedictus</hi> wanted the Seal of the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and so did <hi>Bromton,</hi> till it was added from some other Copy, and not out of <hi>Hoveden,</hi> for the Seals differ, and some Copies of <hi>Hoveden</hi> have it not at all. And tho the Compiler of this History seems to have lived in the Time of <hi>Richard I.</hi> as himself seems to intimate, yet <hi>Col. 967.</hi> it mentions <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> which must have been added to continue down the Genealogy of our Kings, as is often done in antient Chronicles by some later Hand. But the Learned Doctor farther supposes this Chronicle to have been written by one <hi>John Brompton,</hi> who (as the Doctor found in an old Manuscript Year-Book, or Collection of Reports of the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>First</hi>) was a <hi>Justice Itinerant</hi> about that Time; which Conjecture is also confirmed by his careful inserting the Antient <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws into this Chronicle: This as it was not done by any before him, so neither does it savour of the Monk.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:93814:11"/>THIS is the more worthy taking notice of, because Sir <hi>William Dugdale</hi> hath omitted this <hi>John Brompton</hi> in his Catalogue of Judges <hi>Itinerant,</hi> at the end of his <hi>Origines Juridiciales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO this Historian succeeds <hi>Henry de Knyghton</hi> Canon of <hi>Leicester,</hi> who wrote his History <hi>de Eventibus Angliae,</hi> beginning with King <hi>Edgar,</hi> and ending with the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>Second.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BVT the Reader may be pleased to take notice, that in these two last Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors are found many Passages which are in none of the more Antient Writers; and since most of them relate to Customs and Terms that had their Original after the coming in of the <hi>Normans,</hi> therefore they may with good Reason be suspected to have been borrowed from some common Stories or Traditions that then passed up and down for current.</p>
            <p>NOR can we here omit several other Pieces of less Bulk and Note, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished since that Volume last mentioned, containing the Chronicles and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories of divers Cathedrals and Abbeys, such as are the <hi>Annals</hi> of the Abbey of <hi>Winchester,</hi> &amp;c. which have been published from the <hi>Cottonian</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Libraries, in <hi>Monasticon Anglicanum,</hi> and the first Volume of <hi>Anglia Sacra,</hi> lately published by the late Learned and Industrious Mr. <hi>Wharton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO these likewise may be added the Histories of the Monasteries of <hi>Ely</hi> and <hi>Ramsey,</hi> as also of <hi>Glastenbury,</hi> by <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> from whom we have taken several Things, not only relating to that Abbey, but the General History of <hi>England:</hi> nor can I omit the History of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford,</hi> whom <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> mentions in his Lives of the Abbots of St. <hi>Albans;</hi> as the <hi>21st</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> he wrote the History of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> as far as the <hi>42d</hi> of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Third;</hi> the first Part of which down to the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest, hath been published in the aforesaid last Volume at <hi>Oxford</hi> by the Learned Dr. <hi>Gale.</hi> From all which last menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, tho mingled with abundance of Monkish Trash, we have here and there excerpted several excellent Remarks.</p>
            <p>WE have also sometimes made use of <hi>Ranulph Higden</hi> his <hi>Polychronicon,</hi> who was a Monk of <hi>Chester,</hi> the first Part of which is published also by the said Dr. <hi>Gale</hi> as far as the Conquest; and <hi>Matthew</hi> a Monk of <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> his <hi>Flores Historiarum:</hi> these Authors being Cotemporaries, and collecting to the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> from all the rest of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Writers abovementioned, I have seldom used but as subsidiary Helps, when the Passages they relate are not to be found any where else, several other Authors they borrowed from, being now lost, or very rare to be met with.</p>
            <p>HAVING now done with our printed Authors, I proceed to those that continue still in Manuscript, in the <hi>Bodleian</hi> and <hi>Cottonian</hi> Libraries; and also in those of <hi>Lambeth, Gresham</hi>'s College, and the <hi>Heraulds Office;</hi> such as are <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Tinmouth</hi> his <hi>Historia Aurea, Johannes Castorius</hi> (in English, <hi>Beaver</hi>) his History of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>John Rouse</hi> of <hi>Warwick</hi> his Collections on the same Subject; together with above forty or fifty nameless Authors which I have perused, to see what I could find in any of them that had not been taken notice of by others: but how little they have answered in my Expectations, the small Additions I have made from them I hope will satisfy the unprejudiced Reader; and for any that are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if they please to take the same Pains that I have done, I wish their Labours may be better requited.</p>
            <p>BVT as for the Extracts of Ecclesiastical Canons and Laws, which I have inserted at the end of divers King's Reigns, I have faithfully transcribed

               </note> in Latin, in answer to what Mr. <hi>Hollingshead</hi> has published concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Homage</hi> that was due from the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> to those of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and is lately translated into <hi>English</hi> by the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Ridpath:</hi> and as I shall here faithfully give you his Arguments against the Antiquity and Credit of our Writers, so I hope I shall return such Answers to them as will satisfy all impartial Readers.</p>
            <p>HIS first Objection is, <q>That from the Death of <hi>Bede,</hi> (whose Credit, he says, he will every where preserve entire,) the <hi>English</hi> have no certain Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story nor Writer to the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> except that Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ethelwerd</hi>'s;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Scotland</hi>'s So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>p. 39, 40.</hi>
                  </note> for (says he) I do not acknowledg that Fragment of <hi>Ingulphus,</hi> who preceded <hi>Ethelwerd</hi> twenty Years, as an History; nor <hi>Asserius Menevensis,</hi> who wrote only concerning the Transactions of his own King <hi>Alfred.</hi>
               </q> And lest he should be thought to affirm any thing rashly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib. 1. fol. 23.</hi>
               </note> 
               <q>He brings <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> to witness the Matter, saying, That all the Memorials of Transactions from the Death of <hi>Bede</hi> to his own Time, which was in the Reign of <hi>Henry I.</hi> about <hi>1142.</hi> were utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lost; nor was there any who followed that Study, or indeavoured to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue the thread of History till himself.</q>
            </p>
            <p>NOW to give an Answer to this Learned Advocate, and take him Point by Point as he goes on; in the first Place I am sorry to find a Person, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise every ways Able and Skillful in his own Profession, so ignorant in our <hi>English</hi> Historians, since if he had not been so, he could not have committed almost as many Mistakes as he hath wrote Lines: for in the first Place he calls <hi>Ingulph</hi> and <hi>Ethelwerd</hi> two Fragments, whereas if he had been pleased to have looked upon either of them, he would have found them entire Pieces so far as they went, (and we call <hi>Polybius, Diodorus Siculus, Salust, Livy,</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, not Fragments, altho each of them be imperfect) only the Edition that was then published of <hi>Ingulph</hi> wanted the Laws of <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vid. Vol. 1. Script. Ang. Edit. Oxon.</note> and some few Sheets at the Conclusion, which have been since added.</p>
            <p>AND whereas he says, that <hi>Ingulph</hi> preceded <hi>Ethelwerd</hi> twenty Years, he is so far from being in the right of that, that the direct contrary is true; for <hi>Ingulph</hi> lived and wrote above one hundred Years after <hi>Ethelwerd</hi> had finished his History with King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Reign, whose Eulogy he only gives us in barbarous Verse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xix" facs="tcp:93814:12"/>AND as for what the Advocate says concerning <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> he much misrepresents the Sense of this Author, who does not affirm that there were no Memorials from the Death of <hi>Bede</hi> to his Time, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for he mentions the <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> in his Proem in these words, <hi>Sunt sanè quaedam vetustatis Indicia, patrio Sermone, &amp; chronico more per annos Domini ordinata:</hi> also in his Book <hi>de Antiquitate Glastoniae</hi> (published by Dr. <hi>Gale,</hi> as above) he citeth them as good Authority, <hi>Tradunt Annales bonae credulitatis,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, Sir <hi>Thomas Craig</hi> himself (I suppose through Forgetfulness) has allowed no less than three Writers of part of our History, who lived before <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> as you may see above: and therefore he must also be understood only in this Sense, that till himself there was none had undertaken an entire <hi>Latin</hi> Body of <hi>English</hi> History; for he, distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between an History and <hi>Annals,</hi> did not reckon (it seems) these <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> as such, though he often mentions them by the Name of the <hi>English</hi> Chronicles; being, as I said before, the ground-Work upon which that Author, as well as others that followed him, built their History: and these <hi>Annals</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in Manuscript till long after Sir <hi>Thomas Craig</hi>'s Death, gave him perhaps occasion to affirm in the same Place, <q>That there is nothing of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty to be found in the <hi>British</hi> History from <hi>734.</hi> which was the Year of <hi>Bede</hi>'s Death, to the Year <hi>957.</hi> but all things were founded upon the Rumours of Antient Men, and it may be old Wives Fables, which being collected together into one Book, and put in a Latin Dress, made up as it were the shadow of a History, from whence <hi>Hollingshead</hi> does nevertheless bring most certain Arguments to establish his fictitious Homage.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Point concerning the <hi>Homage</hi> I shall not take upon me here to decide: but tho I confess there is no express mention of it in the <hi>Annals,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Florenc. An. Dom. 921.943.</hi>
               </note> yet I must needs say there is somewhat to be met with in them that comes very near it; for under <hi>Anno 924.</hi> they relate thus of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Elder,</hi> 
               <q>That the King and whole Nation of the <hi>Scots</hi> chose him <hi>in Patrem &amp; Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> in the Latin Version, <hi>i. e.</hi> for their Father and Lord; which is word for word the same with the <hi>Saxon</hi> Original, which I omit because not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly understood or read in that Character.</q> But because he supposes that <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> was the first Author that wrote this <hi>Homage</hi> and <hi>Fealty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Craig. ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra. p. 47.</hi>
               </note> therefore he must be the first that ever mentioned the Submission of the <hi>Scotish</hi> King to the King of <hi>England:</hi> I desire those of Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his Opinion to tell me, tho the formal Ceremonies of <hi>Homage</hi> and <hi>Fealty</hi> (which in different Ages and divers Countries, even where the Feudal Law was obtained, were very different) were not brought up till after the Norman <hi>William</hi> came hither; yet what could those words <hi>in Patrem &amp; Dominum</hi> signify, but such an Acknowledgment or Dependance upon a Superior Lord as was tantamount? And it is the more remarkable, because this is mentioned above <hi>20</hi> Years before. The same <hi>Annals</hi> relate, that King <hi>Edmund</hi> the <hi>Younger,</hi> Son to King <hi>Edward,</hi> bestowed <hi>Cumberland</hi> upon <hi>Malcolm</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> viz. <hi>Anno 945.</hi> on condition, that he should serve him in his Expeditions by Sea and Land, for which alone the <hi>Scotish</hi> Writers will allow this <hi>Homage</hi> to have been due.</p>
            <p>AND in the Year following we find in the same <hi>Annals,</hi> that K. <hi>Eadred,</hi> Brother to <hi>Edmund,</hi> having reduced all <hi>Northumberland</hi> into his Power, (which then took in almost all the Low-Lands of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as far as <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh)</hi> thereupon <hi>Scoti etiam ei juramenta praestiterunt, sese velle qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>quid is vellet,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation (by which I suppose must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:93814:13"/>
the <hi>King</hi> as well as the <hi>People</hi>) took an Oath to King <hi>Eadred</hi> to perform whatsoever he should please to command them. But that <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> understood this to be an Oath of <hi>Fealty,</hi> appears by his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase of these words in the <hi>Annals</hi> thus, <hi>&amp; Edredus à Scotis, ut sibi fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les essent, juramentum accepit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BVT that, if not <hi>Homage,</hi> yet somewhat very like it, was rendered in that Age by the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> to those of <hi>England,</hi> for the best part of what is now called the <hi>Lowlands,</hi> may appear from the Testimony of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford,</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>John Fordun</hi> the antientest <hi>Scotish</hi> Historian, acknowledges in these words, That King <hi>Edmund (viz.</hi> of <hi>England</hi>) gave the Province of <hi>Cumberland</hi> to <hi>Malcolm</hi> King of <hi>Scots, sub fidelitate Juramenti;</hi> and it was afterwards agreed between the said King <hi>Edmund</hi> and King <hi>Malcolm,</hi> that Prince <hi>Indulf</hi> his next Heir, and all the future Heirs of <hi>Scotland</hi> successively, should pay to King <hi>Edmund</hi> and his Successors for the same, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magium, &amp; fidelitatis Sacramentum:</hi> so that if our English Writers have been mistaken in calling that Submission, which the Kings and Princes of <hi>Scotland</hi> then payed to <hi>England, Homage,</hi> you may here see the most An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Scotish</hi> Historian guilty of the same Error: which was indeed an Oath of Fidelity, if not the same, yet very like what the <hi>Scotish</hi> Kings afterwards took when they did <hi>Homage</hi> to our Kings of <hi>England</hi> after the Conquest.</p>
            <p>HAVING said thus much, I shall now leave it to the Reader's Judgment, when he has gone through our <hi>Annals,</hi> to consider, whether this Author's Censure of our <hi>English</hi> History, from the Year <hi>734.</hi> when <hi>Bede</hi> ended his, to the Year <hi>957.</hi> be just, <hi>that they were only things,</hi> as he says, <hi>founded upon the Rumours of Antient Men, and it may be old Wives Fables, and so being collected together in one Book, dress'd up in Latin, made up as it were the shadow of a History.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS also whether what <hi>Florence</hi> is cited by the Author to say, <q>That after <hi>Bede</hi>'s Death the <hi>English</hi> History ceased, and that for his own part he had left things to Posterity, either as he found them in the Text of the <hi>English</hi> Chronicles, or as he had them from the relations of Men worthy of Credit,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Idem. pa. 41.</hi>
                  </note> or heard and saw them himself; deserves that rash Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, not only concerning these <hi>Annals</hi> now published, but of <hi>Florence</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>viz. as to what concerned the Text of the English Chronicles, he mentioned them that he might deceive his Reader with the greater Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility:</hi> whereas <hi>Florence</hi> was accounted always a Writer of unquestionable Diligence and Veracity, as appears by the several Testimonies of Learned Men before his History.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BVT the reason of this Author's Triumph before the Victory, was, that he did not believe any such thing as a <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicle could be found; for says he immediately after,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Id. ibid.</hi>
               </note> 
               <q>If there were any Chronicles of those Times, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Florence</hi> lived about the Year <hi>1148.</hi> they must still remain in the Archives, which hitherto no English Author did ever alledg, or hath been able to demonstrate; for that Chronicle, as is observed by the Prologue, did only set down the number of Years.</q> And so he proceeds to invalidate the Credit of <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> as if he had had no Voucher to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant his Chronicle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:93814:13"/>BVT I hope this Translation I here present you with, will satisfy all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Readers, that the <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> do contain much more than the bare numbers of Years, and the Edition first published by Mr. <hi>Wheelock</hi> in <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> from two Copies in Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s, and <hi>Bennet Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege</hi> Libraries, have long since convinced all Learned Men, that we really had such Monuments in our <hi>Archives,</hi> which have been also farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed as to the Truth of it, from two other Manuscript Copies, given by Arch-bishop <hi>Laud</hi> to the <hi>Bodleian</hi> Library at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and lately published together with those abovementioned, by the aforesaid Mr. <hi>Edmund Gibson;</hi> most of which Copies belonged to several antient Monasteries, and I doubt not but many more of them were lost at their Dissolation in <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth</hi>'s Time, or carried over Seas; for we find <hi>Lazius</hi> in his Book <hi>de Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratione Gentium,</hi> quotes several of them. And it's evident that our <hi>Annals</hi> sometimes follow not Tradition only, but also old written Histories, and perhaps <hi>Latin</hi> Writers, as may appear by the Actions of <hi>Athelstane</hi> and <hi>Eadmund, An. 938,</hi> and <hi>942.</hi> But for the support of their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I refer the Reader to this Author's own Country-man <hi>John Fordun,</hi> where he tells us in his Prologue to his <hi>Scotish</hi> History, <q>He had heard it was very well ordered in <hi>England,</hi> that every Monastery of Royal Foundation should have its particular Writer, who was Chronologically to set down all the Memorable things which happened in each King's Reign, either in their own or Neighbouring Kingdoms; and that at the next Great Council af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Death of every respective King, each of those Chronographers met there, and produced whatsoever they had so remarked; and that some of the most discreet Persons in the said Council who were best skilled in such Matters, being chosen for that purpose, should examine those Memorials, and by comparing them together should extract a brief Chronicle from them all, which was to be preserved in the Libraries of those Monasteries, as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick <hi>Annals</hi> to be relied on by Posterity, that so the remembrance of those publick Affairs of the Kingdom might not be lost, or devoured by the Rust of Time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WHICH Passage had Sir <hi>Thomas Craig</hi> but carefully considered, he would have had no reason to doubt whether we had had <hi>any Chronicles of those times remaining in our Archives,</hi> and whether <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and all the rest of our Historians, have blindly followed <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> into an Error,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Id. p. 47.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>as Cattel do their Leader that break over a Ditch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BVT if our <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> were not a good Foundation for succeeding Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians to build upon, I desire to know what Credit the Antient <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Authors can claim with Men of that scrupulous Temper, since they had nothing but such short <hi>Annals</hi> or Chronicles preserved in their Archives, (besides Traditions, and the common Fame of their Ancestors) from whence to compose the particular Histories of those Common-Wealths they treat of; such as were the <hi>Libri Lintei</hi> preserved in the Capitol, from whence <hi>Livy</hi> drew the most antient Memorials for the writing his <hi>Roman</hi> History.</p>
            <p>AND tho there is some difference to be found between the several Copies of these <hi>Annals</hi> as to the Calculation of Years, and some particular Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that are sometimes inserted in one, and omitted in another; yet the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Author of the Preface before it, has given the World a satisfactory Answer as to this Matter, which is, <q>That as to the general Affairs of the whole Kingdom they all agree well enough, tho indeed as to foreign Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions,
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:93814:14"/>
or some few Passages relating to their own private Monasteries, there may be some Additions that are not to be met with in the rest; as may be observ'd from those called the <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Laudean</hi> Copies in the <hi>Bodleian</hi> Library.</q>
            </p>
            <p>SO I shall leave it upon the whole Matter to the Reader to consider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Author has made good his Challenge, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>English</hi> were not able to produce one approved Writer of their own Countrey, who composed any Story or History from the Death of <hi>Bede,</hi> to the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> tho I suppose he meant the <hi>First,</hi> however it is unluckily printed twice the <hi>Second</hi> in one Page.</p>
            <p>BVT to come to this Author's second Objection against our <hi>English</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians, the substance of which is, <q>That the Writers as well before as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Conquest were Monks, who being dead to the World, have no right of giving a Legal Evidence, it being expresly forbid by the Canon Law to concern themselves in secular Matters; and also that by reason of their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Lives, they ought very seldom to be entrusted in publick Affairs, seeing they are no competent Judges concerning them: for it was not very probable that either the Secrets of Princes, or things belonging to the State, were ever communicated to them, otherwise than by common Report, seeing they were kept at the greatest distance from all manner of Action, and do oftentimes embrace things doubtful as certain, and Fictions for Matter of Fact; and that therefore this feigned <hi>Homage</hi> must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity fall to the Ground, for which there is no better Evidence than that of a Monk; for it will not be admitted as a good Conclusion, that because a Monk says so, therefore it is true.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Argument may as easily be retorted upon him thus, That as a thing is not true because a Monk writes it, so neither is it false for that reason alone; for tho Monks are by the Canon Law forbid medling with Secular Affairs, and may not perhaps be admitted for good Witnesses in Civil Causes, yet is this but a meer Cavil as to the Point in Question, since that was not the intent of the Canon to forbid them the writing either of Civil or Ecclesiastical Histories; and <hi>Bede</hi> himself (whose Credit this Author says he will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair) was a Monk, as were also <hi>Marianus Scotus</hi> (whom he alloweth and would have to be taken for his own Countrey-Man) <hi>Sigebertus, Herman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Contractus,</hi> and almost all the Famous Chronographers of those Times, who flourished in our Neighbouring Nations as well as our own; and that they were not of such retired Lives as not to have Memorials sent them of publick Actions, appears by the aforesaid Citation out of <hi>Fordun,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manner of writing our <hi>English Annals</hi> in the Monasteries, which, as he tells us, were supervised afterwards by some appointed of the Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Kingdom. And that some of the Monks after the Conquest were in great Reputation for their faithful Accounts, appears by the great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit given to <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> in those times; the last of whom dedicated his History to <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloucester</hi> Natural Son to King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>First:</hi> and <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> was of so great Esteem, that we learn from himself, that King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> gave him particular Directions for inserting into his History several con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Passages relating to his own Reign: so far were the Princes of that Age from being of this Author's Opinion, that Monks were no wise fit to write History, nor to be credited when they had done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:93814:14"/>BVT if no Credit must be given to the Memorials of Monks, I desire to know, what will become of the so much talked of <hi>Scotish Annals</hi> that were kept in the Isle of <hi>Jona</hi> or <hi>Ilcomhil,</hi> and of their famous Book of the Abbey of <hi>Pasely,</hi> from whence <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> pretends to have derived the principal Matters that make up the first part of his History? Nay, what will become of their most creditable Writer <hi>John Fordun,</hi> who bottoms much of his History on the Legends of <hi>S. Brendane,</hi> and others?</p>
            <p>NOR is there any difference that I know of between these Books now mentioned and our <hi>Saxon Annals,</hi> but that these are to be seen (I mean the Originals) in our Libraries, and are also published both in <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> and are here translated into <hi>English</hi> in this ensuing History, whilst theirs are not; and if <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> ever saw them, is more than we can be sure of, since a most Reverend Doctor (and now Bishop of our Church) hath produced very good Reasons to render it highly suspicious,<note place="margin">

               </note> that there never were any such Books at all; and if so, I wonder what will become of the Credit of all their Antient <hi>Scotish</hi> History, and their long Bedroll of Kings before <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> the Second.</p>
            <p>AS for the rest of this Author's Objections, I shall be very short in my Answers to them.</p>
            <p>THE third of which is, that our Authors are not to be credited, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are <hi>English-men.</hi> If this were of any weight, I might turn his own Cannon upon him, and tell him, no more are his Writers who deny this <hi>Homage,</hi> because they are <hi>Scots-men:</hi> and if neither are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, I would fain have any Learned Gentleman of that Nation to shew me a Foreign Historian who lived near those Times, that denied there was any such thing.</p>
            <p>AS for his last, that they were <hi>Enemies,</hi> it is yet more trivial; since I have here made use of no Authorities but what were written before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, when there was no War at all between the two Nations, but rather a strict Amity or League against their Common Enemy the <hi>Danes;</hi> or else from <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> Authors that lived and wrote (as hath been already shewn) in the very Times when those Homages they mention were done; which whether they were for <hi>Scotland</hi> it self, or else for <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Cumberland,</hi> which they then held of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> shall be further considered in my next Volume, if God shall permit me to finish it.</p>
            <p>BVT I desire the Reader to take notice, that finding the <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Chronicle to be very dry in many places, it giving us only an account of the Succession of their Kings, and the Battles they fought against one another, without ever telling us what were the Grounds of their falling out; the Monks of those Times, for want of Civil Affairs, or (as we call them) <hi>those of the Cabinet,</hi> filling up their <hi>Annals</hi> only with Fighting and Devotion, I saw it necessary for me to pursue in great part the Method that <hi>Bede</hi> had laid down throughout the whole Work, and to insert some things relating to Ecclesiastical Affairs, to make this History more useful, as well as diverting, to all sort of Persons.</p>
            <p>AND therefore being sensible of the near Conjunction of the Civil with the Ecclesiastical State, which were often united into one <hi>Mycel-Synod,</hi> or Great Council of the whole Nation, wherein were made not only Civil Laws, but also Ecclesiastical Canons or Constitutions, respecting Religion and Discipline, as well as Reformation of Manners, I have set down both
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:93814:15"/>
the one and the other whenever I thought they contained any Matter of more than ordinary Notice: and as for those Synods or Councils which were wholly Ecclesiastical, though I have not always expresly given you all the Canons they made, yet I have not failed to refer the Reader for his farther Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, to that rich Treasury of this kind of Knowledg, Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>'s first Volume of Councils.</p>
            <p>TO which I have likewise not only added the Succession of some Bishops, and Abbots, as far as I have found them in the <hi>Saxon Annals,</hi> but have inserted from <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> and other Writers, whatever I could find relating to them, or any other of the same Order, remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Learning or Piety; especially the Arch-bishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> whose Successions I have often supplied from other Authors, wherein the <hi>Annals</hi> were silent.</p>
            <p>NOR have I omitted the Foundations of the greater Monasteries, as I met with them in the <hi>Annals,</hi> no more than the other Foundations of the same kind set down in <hi>Monasticon Anglicanum,</hi> yet still confining my self to such of them as were valued at <hi>500 l. per annum</hi> or more, at the time of their Dissolution. And I hope no Man that is a Lover of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, or the Honour of his Nation, will look upon this as needless, any more than the Foundations of our two <hi>famous Universities,</hi> of which I have here given you the earliest Accounts I can find.</p>
            <p>NEITHER do I suppose it will prove tedious, if I have here likewise put down the Stories of some Miracles related by <hi>Bede</hi> and other Monks, since I have done it with Moderation, and where the Contexture of this Work would have seem'd Lame and Imperfect without it; and I only give them you just as I find them, leaving every one to make what Judgment he pleases of them.</p>
            <p>I confess I am not satisfied that divers of those Relations swallowed by <hi>Bede</hi> and other Authors of Note, are true, they having been since discovered by Men of great Learning and Judgment, to carry evident Marks of Forgery along with them; such as is that of <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathea</hi> his Preaching the Gospel in <hi>England,</hi> which hath been examined with great Accuracy by the Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> now Lord Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chap. 1.</hi>
               </note> in his <hi>Origines Britannicae</hi>; so that though I have both from him, and others, said somewhat upon that Subject, yet I must still refer the Reader to the Book it self, if he desires farther Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction either in gratifying his Curiosity, or informing his Judgment.</p>
            <p>BVT to the foregoing Relations, I must needs here add that of the Martyrdom of St. <hi>Alban,</hi> which though the Learned Author last named, in his second Chapter of his said Book, hath with great Learning proved it, if not true, yet at least probable; I hope he will not take it amiss if I farther examine the Certainty of this Story: for notwithstanding it be set down in the old <hi>Roman</hi> Martyrologies, and his Suffering here is also mentioned by <hi>Constantius,</hi> Presbyter, who lived above one hundred Years before <hi>Bede,</hi> from whom I have borrowed this; yet I must Ingenuously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, I do not see how it can consist with the Ecclesiastical or Civil History of those Times,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib. 1. c. 6.</hi>
               </note> in which it is supposed to have happened. For <hi>Bede</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Suffering of St. <hi>Alban</hi> during the Persecution of <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> and after the Recovery of <hi>Britain</hi> from the Vsurpation of <hi>Allectus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEREAS it is evident from Chronology, that <hi>Carausius</hi> the Vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, having <hi>Anno Dom. 286.</hi> rebelled against the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, held
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:93814:15"/>
               <hi>Britain</hi> under his Power for near seven Years, and then was murdered by the Vsurper <hi>Allectus,</hi> who also governed near three Years longer, till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Dioclesian;</hi> who having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted <hi>Constantius Chlorus, Caesar,</hi> sent <hi>Asclepiodotus</hi> as his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant into <hi>Britain,</hi> (being then part of his Share, as were all the Provinces on this side the <hi>Alpes</hi>) in the Year <hi>295.</hi> and he having slain <hi>Allectus</hi> in Battel, governed here some short Time, till <hi>Constantius</hi> himself coming over in Person, reigned as <hi>Caesar</hi> or <hi>Augustus</hi> so long as he lived: Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all which Revolutions we do not read of any Persecution in <hi>Britain,</hi> as the Learned Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> in his <hi>Dissertationes Cyprianae</hi> has very well observed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dissert. Cypr. 11. de paucita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Martyrum, §. 75.</hi>
               </note> and consequently St. <hi>Alban</hi> could not suffer Martyrdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Years <hi>303.</hi> and <hi>305.</hi> or at any other Time where the <hi>Roman</hi> Martyrologies place it.</p>
            <p>AND this I think is clear from the Testimonies of two Author of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable Credit, who lived in the very Time when this (if at all) must have happened. The first of these is <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap. 13.</hi>
               </note> who in his eighth Book of Ecclesiastical History, giving a Character of <hi>Constantius</hi> the Emperor, hath these words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>He always shewed himself most benign and affable towards all Men, which appeared by this, that he was no ways partaker of the Persecution raised against us <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Christians: but having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the Worshippers of the true God free and unhurt from all Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, and not having so much as destroyed the Buildings of our Churches, or acted any thing against those of our Religion, he at last attained a quiet and happy End.</q> To which we may also add another Passage in his first Book, <hi>cap. 8.</hi> but it being more tedious, and not so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press and full as the Place now cited, I therefore omit it.</p>
            <p>TO whom we may also subjoin <hi>Lactantius,</hi> who in his Treatise <hi>de Mortibus Persecutorum,</hi> differs indeed from <hi>Eusebius</hi> about his demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing the Christian Churches, yet he agrees with him in the main, that no Christians suffered Death in <hi>Constantius</hi> his Division or Share of the Empire. This Author's words I have thus translated. <q>But <hi>Constantius,</hi> lest he should seem to dissent from the Edicts of the greater Emperors, tho he permitted the Meeting-places of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Assemblies, that could be rebuilt, to be pulled down, yet he still preserved the true Temple of God, which is in the Bodies of Men, safe and inviolate.</q>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib. 1.</hi>
               </note> And this is farther confirmed by <hi>Optatus de Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi> as also by <hi>Zozomen</hi> in his Ecclesiastical History,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib. 2.</hi>
               </note> who both reciting the Address of the <hi>Donatists</hi> to the Emperor <hi>Constantine,</hi> do acknowledg that <hi>his Father never shed the Blood of any Christian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND even this small difference between these two Authors may be thus reconciled, by supposing that tho he connived at the destroying of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches by the vulgar Pagans, yet he no ways commanded it, much less approved of it when it was done. So that there could be no Persecution in <hi>Gaul</hi> or <hi>Britain,</hi> (both which were part of his Province) during the Time that he continued either as <hi>Caesar</hi> or Emperor, and the Persecution ceased <hi>Anno Dom. 308.</hi> not long before his Death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:93814:16"/>BVT since a Learned and Ingenious French-man, <hi>Theodorus Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inartus,</hi> in his Preface to a late Treatise, entituled, <hi>de Actibus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrum,</hi> put out with a new Edition of this Work of <hi>Lactantius</hi> in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> hath endeavoured to justify the Martyrologies against this Opinion of Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s, I think it very convenient to take some notice of what he there alledges; and his chief Argument against these plain Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is, that the Emperor <hi>Maximian</hi> was in <hi>Gaul</hi> during some part of this Persecution, and that then the Power of <hi>Constantius</hi> being only as <hi>Caesar,</hi> was suspended by the Presence of the Emperor himself; and consequently the Persecution was carried on in that part of the Empire, notwithstanding <hi>Constantius</hi> his private dislike of it, or perhaps oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it as much as he durst.</p>
            <p>BVT in return to this seeming Argument, we shall first observe, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eusebius</hi> nor <hi>Lactantius,</hi> mention any Persecution in <hi>Gaul</hi> or <hi>Britain</hi> during all this Time, which it is highly probable they would have done, had it been carried on with the like Fury in these as it was in the other parts of the Empire. So that I do not find this Author clearly makes out, that the Emperor <hi>Maximian</hi> was in <hi>Gaul</hi> during this Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by any other Testimonies than those Martyrolgies themselves, whose Credit we have just reason to question.</p>
            <p>BVT suppose I should admit there was a Persecution in <hi>Gaul</hi> at the same Time as he affirms, what will this concern <hi>Britain,</hi> where it is certain from the Authority abovementioned, that the Power of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> was never abrogated, or suspended by any of the other Emperors? But if it appears there was no such Persecution in <hi>Gaul</hi> as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, can one with reason believe that there should be any at that Time in <hi>Britain,</hi> which lay so much more remote, and out of the View or Notice of those persecuting Emperors? But <hi>Michael Alford</hi> in his <hi>British Annals,</hi> being sensible of the great Improbability of this Persecution between the Years <hi>303,</hi> and <hi>305.</hi> when upon <hi>Constantius</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing declared Emperor, all Authors agree the Persecution ceased all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Empire; he therefore antedates the Time of it to the Year <hi>287,</hi> when he supposes that St. <hi>Alban,</hi> after he had been kept six Months in Prison, suffered Martyrdom, <hi>viz.</hi> in the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oclesian</hi> and <hi>Maximian;</hi> and for this he cites an antient Manuscript Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of <hi>Bede</hi> which he had seen, as also the Authority of <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> in his History,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>An. 1257. An. 794.</hi>
               </note> and <hi>Matthew Westminster,</hi> who both follow an old Martyrologist cited by <hi>Capgrave,</hi> as much antienter than <hi>Bede.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO this Opinion we reply, that in the first place it does not appear by any Authority, but this Writer's bare conjecture, that there was any Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Britain</hi> or <hi>Gaul</hi> at the beginning of the Emperors Reigns above mentioned, but rather the contrary, since <hi>Eusebius</hi> expresly tells us, that <hi>Dioclesian</hi> was so far from persecuting, that he favoured and employed the Christians in all Offices both Civil and Military, till after the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> War, which was toward the latter end of his Reign. Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed could this Persecution have happened under the Vsurpations of <hi>Carausius</hi> and <hi>Allectus</hi> here in <hi>Britain,</hi> seeing they were always engaged in defending themselves against the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, and therefore
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:93814:16"/>
could not be at leisure to persecute Men for Religion during such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settled Times.</p>
            <p>AND as for the Authority of these Martyrologies which this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor urges for the Truth of this Persecution, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are some of them very Antient, the Originals of them being about <hi>900</hi> Years old: I doubt this will be so far from supporting their Credit, that it will rather be instrumental to destroy it, since it is very well known that it was about the end of the fifth, or beginning of the sixth Century, that this trick of forging the Lives and Sufferings of Saints came first in Fashion, and so was carried on in those dark Times for near <hi>500</hi> Years following, as the Reverend Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> (now Bishop of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury</hi>) has learnedly proved in his Preface to his Translation of the aforesaid Treatise of <hi>Lactantius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOR did the Monks fail of finding their Account in this Design, since nothing contributed more than this and such like Legends, to the worshipping of the Reliques of Saints, and going on Pilgrimages to their Tombs: Which Superstition, how much it advanced the worldly Power and Grandeur of the Clergy of those Times, he must be a great Stranger to the Ecclesiastical as well as Civil History of those Ages, not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>
            <p>HAVING now, I hope, gone through all those things I thought neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to advertise the Reader of, I have little else remaining, but to ask his Pardon for not adding in the Margin some short Notes or Contents of what is in the Body of the Work; which tho I confess several Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians have done, yet I thought it might very well be spared here: First, Because in my Opinion it spoils the Beauty of the Margin; and besides, this Volume being written in an exact Chronological Order, it will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry easy for the Reader, (if he will but please to remember near the Year about which any thing he would find, happened) to satisfy himself in the Matter he would know, by turning over but two or three Pages: and further, the Years of our Lord standing in <hi>Roman</hi> Figures in the Margin, do in many Places fill that Space which those Contents usually take up. But if these Reasons by some may not be thought sufficient, a good Friend of mine has been at the Pains, for your sake, as well as my ease, to make an exact Table to the whole Work, by which I am confident you cannot miss readily finding out any thing whatsoever you have a desire to be satisfied in, that is contained in this Volume, either as to Persons, Places or Things.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to make this History as diverting as I could by variety of Matter, as also by inserting into it whatsoever Relations I met with in our old Historians, that were not utterly improbable; and therefore I hope the Reader will not be uneasy, because all the parts thereof are not kept up alike pleasant and agreeable, since the dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Matter, and the barrenness of those few Authors I find in some Periods, will not always equally afford it; any more than it can be expected, that in a long Journey it should be alike pleasant Travelling through dark and narrow Lanes, as over a free and open Champaign.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:93814:17"/>THERE is one thing more I must needs stand obliged to you in for your Pardon, and that is, the many <hi>Errata</hi>'s you will find in the first four Books; for being out of Town when near half of it was wrought off, I could not supervise it my self: and though I committed the Correction of those Sheets to a Person on whom I could (as I have done before) safely rely for his Ability and Faithfulness in the discharge of that Trust; yet no Man is able to judg of the Author's Sense so well as himself, nor consequently to mend it, if any where too Obscure or Mistaken; and I cannot, as I would, answer so well for the Care of my <hi>Amanuensis</hi> in his Writing or Pointing: and I must add this also, that some Printers are not always so careful as they should be to amend their own Faults, tho never so exactly Corrected by those to whom their Sheets were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted for that Purpose.</p>

            <head>THE General Introduction TO THE Whole Work.</head>
            <p>SINCE the late Learned Doctor <hi>Howell</hi> and Doctor <hi>Brady,</hi> the former in his Second and Third Parts of his General History of the World, and the latter in his General Preface, and First Book of his Compleat History of <hi>England,</hi> have given us a large Account of the Political Government and Laws in this Part of our Island we now call <hi>England,</hi> during the time of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, as also of our <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Kings, as far as the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest; this Undertaking of Mine would look very imperfect, if I should not in some measure follow their Method, and prefix before it something of the like nature.</p>
            <p>I have therefore made bold to borrow from Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> and those other Authors who have written on this Subject, whatsoever I thought was necessary to carry on the same Design; and also added those Things that I found they have either omitted or mistaken, and which required more largely to be treated of, in order to render this Work as use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as possible I could for a matter of so great Importance.</p>
            <p>TO begin then with the Government of the <hi>Britains</hi> before the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> into this Island: Of which we have scarce any Account but what can be gathered from <hi>Geoffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> which is so uncertain and fabulous, that there is little reliance upon what he says, save that in the general it was governed by Kings, and often canton'd into several Kingdoms: for that it was ever under one Monarch, as he frequently affirms, I have very good reason to doubt; it being not only contrary to the <hi>Genius</hi> and Custom of the <hi>British</hi> Nation, (where all the Male Issue inherited alike) to suffer the Eldest Son to go away with the whole Inheritance, but likewise it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly opposite to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Account of this Island when he came first hither, which he says he found divided into several distinct Principalities and States.</p>
            <p>BUT if any Part of <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s Relation be true, that is most likely to be so which he gives us of the Laws of <hi>Molmutius,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>THAT the Temples of the Gods had this Privilege, That whatever guilty Persons should fly to them, they should be secure from their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors; because we find that Custom very antient, not only amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> but indeed all other Nations, the <hi>Jews</hi> not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:93814:18"/>NEXT, That the publick Ways leading to the said Temples, and the Cities wherein they were, should be free and safe. And,</p>
            <p>LASTLY, That such a Proportion of Land should maintain so many Ploughs for the Encouragement of Husbandry; which was very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in a Countrey, where not only the Soil, but the Laziness of the Inhabitants, rendr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>BUT I cannot forbear observing how little stress is to be laid on <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s Account of the Laws of those <hi>British</hi> Princes, since he has the Confidence to tell us of another Sett of Laws supposed to be made by Queen <hi>Martia,</hi> which, he says, being afterwards translated by King <hi>Alfred</hi> out of the <hi>British</hi> Lang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rchen-Lage.</hi> The Falshood of which Derivation Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> has very well discovered, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That this Word had not its Original from Queen <hi>Martia,</hi> but from the <hi>Saxon</hi> Word <hi>Mearc,</hi> signifying a Limit or Boundary; from whence the <hi>Mercian</hi> Kingdom had its Name, and was so called from its Situation, as being circumscribed by the other Kingdoms of the <hi>Heptarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT as for the <hi>British</hi> Government that succeeded upon the <hi>Romans</hi> deserting of this Island, we can say no more of it, than that it was Regal; but that it was all subject to one Monarch, I no where find. For tho it appears from <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Nennius,</hi> that <hi>Vortigerne</hi> was made King not long after the <hi>Romans</hi> leaving it, yet does it not follow from thence, that there were no more Kings than he at the same time; since it seems very unlikely, that all <hi>Britain</hi> (properly so called) which in the time of the <hi>Romans</hi> was divided into so many distinct Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, each of which had their particular <hi>Praefects</hi> or Deputies, should so unanimously agree in the Choice of this <hi>Vortigerne,</hi> whom <hi>Geoffrey</hi> preposterously relates to have been then Count of the <hi>Gewises,</hi> when indeed there were no such People of that Name in Being, till the erecting of the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Kingdom; those People being then (and not before) so called from one <hi>Gewis,</hi> an Ancestor of <hi>Hengist.</hi> And <hi>Gildas,</hi> who lived within fourscore Years after the Reign of this <hi>Vortigerne,</hi> tells us of no less than four distinct Kings reigning together in this Part of the Island, and mentions not a Word of its ever being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p>BUT that the Titles of those Kings who reigned here during the first Wars between the <hi>Britains</hi> and the <hi>Saxons,</hi> were oftner by Election than Succession, may appear not only from <hi>Geoffrey</hi> himself, but also from <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> and <hi>Nennius,</hi> who are Authors of better Credit; and they relate <hi>Vortimer</hi> the eldest Son of <hi>Vortigerne,</hi> to have been elected upon his Father's Deposition, King of the <hi>Britains</hi>; and after his Death, and the second Desertion of <hi>Vortigerne,</hi> that <hi>Aurelius Ambrosius</hi> was elected first General, and some time afterwards King of the <hi>Britains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOR can we believe that these Kings were Absolute or Despotick Monarchs, since we find that Government unsutable to the Temper of the <hi>British</hi> Nation, both then, and in succeeding times; having not only frequently cast off the Government of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, but also of their own Kings, for their cruel Tyranny and Oppression.</p>
            <p>AND that this way of the Election of one supream King over the rest, was after often used by the <hi>Britains,</hi> you will find in the History it self; not but that it must be confessed, that the several petty Kingdoms o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Principalities which the <hi>Britains</hi> still possessed, and that go under the Name of <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South-Wales,</hi> did commonly descend, and were divisable among the several Sons of the deceased Prince, tho it was with great Inequality and Confusion; which often produced frequent Civil Wars between the Contending Competitors, and became the Ruin of them all at last.</p>
            <p>BUT to pass from these <hi>British</hi> Princes, and the manner of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as well before the coming in, as after the Desertion of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and which (tho not in its due order of Time) I have here put together, that the Reader might have a full View of it all at once. I proceed now to the Civil and Military A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ministration of the <hi>Romans</hi> whilst they continued Masters of this Part of <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>JVLIVS Caesar,</hi> when he had rather view'd than conquer'd this Island, left it, upon the Delivery of some Hostages, and the Promise of send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over more into <hi>Gaul,</hi> together with a certain Tribute to the Senate and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> neither of which the <hi>Britains</hi> ever perform'd; but during the Civil Wars, which not longer after ensued, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their antient Liberty, which for divers Years they enjoyed, till the Emperor <hi>Claudius,</hi> at the Instigation of one <hi>Bericus</hi> a Fugitive, and upon a Pretence of their denying the <hi>Romans</hi> to trade here, sent over first <hi>Aulus Plautius</hi> as his Lieutenant, and then following pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently afterwards himself in Person, made the <hi>Britains</hi> (I mean the greatest part of them) partly by Force, and partly by Fear, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselves to his Empire; tho in a great measure under the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of their own Kings, who only paid Tribute, and received <hi>Roman</hi> Garisons, and suffered them to erect Colonies where they pleas'd: during which time the Government of the <hi>Romans</hi> was rather Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary than Civil, the People living after their own Laws.</p>
            <p>NOR were the <hi>Britains</hi> wholly subdued by them, till upon their Insurrection under Queen <hi>Boadicia</hi> in the Time of <hi>Nero,</hi> when <hi>Paulus Suetonius</hi> being Legate or Lieutenant here, reduced them (tho with great difficulty) under the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke.</p>
            <p>BUT the Civil Wars that afterwards happened upon the Death of <hi>Nero,</hi> hindred their entire Conquest, until such time as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Vespasian</hi> sent over that famous Commander <hi>Agricola</hi> to be his General here; who in a few Years, having laid aside their petty Kings, brought it into the Form of a Province under the <hi>Roman</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, sometimes stiled <hi>Presidents,</hi> sometimes <hi>Consulares,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Legati</hi> or <hi>Procuratores,</hi> as the Emperor's Commission, or the various Appellations of the <hi>Roman</hi> Historians are pleased to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title them.</p>
            <p>AND then it was, I suppose, this Part of the Island was first divided into several <hi>Praefectships</hi> or Governments, tho how many they were, cannot be ascertained; only we find from the Breviary of <hi>Sextus Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus,</hi> that in the Reign of <hi>Constantine</hi> it was parcell'd into these four for its better Administration, <hi>viz.

<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:93814:19"/>
the Province of <hi>Valentia,</hi> so called from the Emperor <hi>Valentinian</hi>; and which, having been taken out of <hi>Maxima Caesariensis,</hi> lay betwixt the Wall of <hi>Hadrian,</hi> and the Friths of <hi>Glotta</hi> and <hi>Bodotria,</hi> which now are those of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Dunbritton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>EACH of which Provinces were under their particular Magistrates, some whereof had the Title of <hi>Consulares,</hi> and others of <hi>Praesides</hi>: all which, according to the <hi>Notitia Romani Imperii,</hi> were by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>'s new Constitutions, made subject to the <hi>Vicarius</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> as he was to the <hi>Praefectus Praetorii</hi> of <hi>Gaul,</hi> who was one of the Four <hi>Praefecti</hi> of <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Erection.</p>
            <p>THIS Vicar of <hi>Britain</hi> had also several inferiour Officers under him for the Civil Administration; as first, he had his <hi>Princeps</hi> or Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant out of the <hi>Agentes in rebus,</hi> that is, from the Chief of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, Solicitors, or Attorney-Generals: he had also from the <hi>Duce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narii,</hi> or Society of the Emperors Pursuivants, a <hi>Cornicularius,</hi> i. e. one that wrote and published the Sentences and Decrees of the Presidents and other Magistrates, and had his Name from <hi>Cornu</hi> a Horn, by the sounding whereof he is supposed to command silence in the Court; then two <hi>Numerarii,</hi> i. e. Clerks Accountants, who did set down all the Sums of the publick Revenues; then a <hi>Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riensis,</hi> i. e. the Jailor or Keeper of the Prison, and was so called from the <hi>Commentaria,</hi> or Kalendars which he kept of the Prisoners, and delivered to the Judges: then certain Officers called <hi>ab Actis,</hi> who were Publick Notaries, that wrote Testaments, Contracts and other Instruments, which were signed before by the Judg or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident, and attested by him, that so after the Death of the Party they might remain Authentick: then other Clerks or Secretaries <hi>de Curâ,</hi> or <hi>de Curâ Epistolarum,</hi> who wrote and sent the Letters and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches of the Governours of Provinces to the Emperor, or to each other.</p>
            <p>BESIDES whom, the <hi>Vicarius</hi> himself, (and, I suppose also, each of the Presidents) had his <hi>Adjutorem,</hi> i. e. his Coadjutor, in case of Sickness, or necessary Absence; as likewise <hi>Subadjuvas,</hi> Under-Assistants, or Assistants to the Adjutor: and, in short, certain other Officers called <hi>Singulares,</hi> from the particular Civil Imployments they had, who seem'd to have been Prosecutors, Informers, or Serjeants; not to mention others of more inferiour Rank, as Apparitors, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, or Messengers. This was the Civil Court of the <hi>Vicarius,</hi> or Deputy of <hi>Britain,</hi> under the <hi>Praefectus Praetorii</hi> of <hi>Gaul,</hi> who had the Power to reverse his Judgments and Decrees.</p>
            <p>THE Ensigns of his Government were a Draught of those Five Parts of <hi>Britain</hi> before-mentioned,<note place="margin">Vid. Pancirol. in Notit. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perii.</note> expressed in the Forms of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Buildings, with the Superscription of their Names placed on the Triangular Form of the Island, as if they had comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ehended the whole Island; the Book of their Instructions covered with Green, and the Commission in a gilt Cover, with several Letters inscribed on the Book, the Signification of which is unnecessary to be here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted; but you will find this, as also a Draught of these <hi>Insignia</hi> themselves, in the above-cited <hi>Pancirollus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BESIDES these general Presidents, there were likewise Courts in all the great Cities, <hi>Municipia,</hi> or Colonies of each Province, which had their several Officers and Magistrates according to the Model of <hi>Rome</hi>
               <pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:93814:19"/>
it self, who heard Causes, and administred Justice to the particular Districts belonging to them, much after the same manner as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments in <hi>France</hi> do at this day.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus concluded their <hi>Civil</hi> Administration, we now come to the <hi>Military,</hi> which was executed by Three Chief Officers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Magister Militum</hi> of the <hi>West,</hi> and they were these, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Comes Britanniarum, Comes Littoris Saxonici,</hi> and the <hi>Dux Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niarum</hi>; whose several Charges, and the Tracts subjected to each of their Commands, may be best discerned by the Names of those Towns where their Under-Officers and Forces are said to have had their Head-quarters. The first of these, <hi>viz.</hi> the Count of <hi>Britain,</hi> is thought to have had his Command over the <hi>Inward</hi> or Middle Part of the Island, because the two others are known to have had theirs over the <hi>Northern</hi> or Maritime Parts thereof; but the <hi>Notitia</hi> assigns not any Forces to the former, nor mentions any Places under his Command, because, as <hi>Pancirollus</hi> writes, the whole Island was then almost over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run by Barbarians.</p>
            <p>BUT as for the <hi>Comes Littoris Saxonici,</hi> so called in the Declension of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, from the charge or Care he had to suppress the <hi>Saxon</hi> Pirates, who often landing on the <hi>Eastern</hi> Parts of <hi>Britain,</hi> (ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over against <hi>Germany</hi>) committed great Ravages there; he had eight <hi>Praepositi,</hi> and one <hi>Tribune</hi> under him, that were Leaders of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Cohorts, consisting of <hi>Gauls, Germans,</hi> and other Foreign Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who quartered in several Towns all along the Coasts, from <hi>Sussex,</hi> as far as the remotest part of <hi>Norfolk:</hi> for the Names of whom, with the Places where they lay, I shall refer you to the <hi>Notitia Imperii Occidentalis,</hi> or (if you had rather have them in <hi>English</hi>) to Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>'s Titles of Honour, and Dr. <hi>Howell</hi>'s second Part, and third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of his General History.</p>
            <p>THE like I may also say of the Forces under the <hi>Dux Britannia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> or General of <hi>Britain,</hi> whose Army, had it then been really in being, was sufficient to have suppressed both the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi>; for they consisted of no less than fourteen <hi>Praefects</hi> or <hi>Praepositi</hi> of Horse and Foot, whose Names, and Places where they quartered (extending from <hi>Lincolnshire</hi> through all the <hi>Northern</hi> Counties, as far as the <hi>Pictish</hi> Borders, and so round about by <hi>Lancashire</hi> into <hi>North-Wales</hi>) you may find in the Authors abovementioned.</p>
            <p>BUT as for the several Ensigns of these three chief Military Officers, they being much what the same with those of the <hi>Vicarius Britanniae, viz.</hi> The Figures of certain Towns, with their Names set over them, together with their Commissions, contained in Books of different co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Covers, with the Emperor's Images set by them on Pillars, I will leave it to those who take more Pleasure than I do in such Curiosities.</p>
            <p>ALL these <hi>Comites</hi> and <hi>Duces</hi> were equal in Power, and only sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to the <hi>Vicarius Britanniae</hi>; the Forces under their Command were not only dispersed through the <hi>Municipia</hi> or Free Colonies, which the <hi>Romans</hi> planted here, and were governed by their own Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates in Imitation of <hi>Rome</hi> their Mother-City, but were also gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd in divers Towns, Castles and Forts, all along the <hi>Roman</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, thereby to discover the Motions of the Neighbouring Nations; several of which being intended only at first for their Military Camps,
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:93814:20"/>
by degrees grew up into Cities, and are known at this day by the Name of <hi>Chesters</hi>; such as are <hi>West-Chester</hi> on the River <hi>Dee, Portchester</hi> in <hi>Hampshire</hi> (now destroyed,) <hi>Chester in the Street</hi> in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> with several others of less note near the <hi>Picts</hi> Wall; as also in the Inland Parts of <hi>England,</hi> ending in the word <hi>Cester,</hi> as <hi>Leicester, Cirencester,</hi> &amp;c. all which owe their Original to the Latin Name <hi>Castra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING now dispatched the <hi>British</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Polity, I come to the main part of Design, which is, to give a brief Account of the Civil Government that the <hi>English Saxons</hi> established in this part of our Island, which they called <hi>England,</hi> who consisting of several Tribes or Nations inhabiting different Countries, yet all speaking the same Language, came over hither at several Times under their particular Leaders; and as soon as they had expelled the <hi>Britains,</hi> they did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the space of about a hundred Years,<note place="margin">The Heprar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</note> erect seven distinct Kingdoms, though not of equal Extent; the Names of which, (notwithstanding they are set down in the History it self, yet having not given you the particular Catalogue of the several Counties they contained, because their Dominions were not then divided into those Districts as they were afterwards,) I have reserved to this place.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1<hi>st.</hi> Kingdom.</note>THE first Kingdom, being that of <hi>Kent,</hi> consisted only of that County and <hi>Surrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2<hi>d.</hi> Kingdom.</note>THE second, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>South-Saxons,</hi> contained <hi>Sussex</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> or at least great part of it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3<hi>d.</hi> Kingdom.</note>THE third was the Kingdom of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> and contained <hi>Devonshire, Dorsetshire, Somersetshire, Wiltshire, Hampshire</hi> and <hi>Berk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</hi> But as for that Countrey called <hi>Cornwall,</hi> I shall not reckon it here, because it was for a long Time after governed by its own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and not brought under the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Dominion till long after</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4<hi>th.</hi> Kingdom.</note>THE fourth was that of the <hi>East-Saxons,</hi> which contained <hi>Essex, Middlesex,</hi> and part of <hi>Hertfordshire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5<hi>th.</hi> Kingdom.</note>THE fifth was that of the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> which contained <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, Yorkshire,</hi> the Bishoprick of <hi>Duresme, Cumberland, Westmorland, Northumberland,</hi> and part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as far as <hi>Edinburgh Frith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Kingdom after the Death of <hi>Ida,</hi> was divided into two parts; the first whereof, containing all the Countries lying on this side the River <hi>Tyne,</hi> was called the Kingdom of <hi>Deira</hi>; and that on the other side of it was called <hi>Bernicia,</hi> and so continued for several Descents, till King <hi>Oswy,</hi> about the Year 643. upon the Murder of King <hi>Oswin</hi> his Cousin, again reduced them into one; and they continued thus united till such time as the <hi>Southern</hi> Provinces were overrun by the <hi>Danes,</hi> as the more <hi>Northern</hi> were by the <hi>Scots,</hi> and have ever since remained part of that Kingdom: and hence it is the Low-Lands of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (that is, all the Countrey from the River <hi>Tyne,</hi> to the <hi>Friths</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Dunbritton,</hi>) antiently spoke the <hi>English Saxon</hi> Tongue, which in succeeding Times was changed into that <hi>English</hi> Dialect they call the Modern <hi>Scotch</hi>; and consists of the old <hi>Saxon,</hi> with no little mixture of the <hi>Danish</hi> Language: this, I suppose, proceeded from the great Conquests, and settling so many of that Nation in those <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Parts.</p>
            <p>THIS is in great measure confirmed by <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Wallingford,</hi> (pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd by the Learned Dr. <hi>Gale</hi>) where he relates,<note place="margin">545.</note> that <hi>Keneth</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> received <hi>Lothian</hi> from King <hi>Edgar,</hi> under the Condition
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:93814:20"/>
of a Homage from himself and his Successors Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the King of <hi>England,</hi> as also that the People of that Countrey should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their Laws and Customs, as also the use of the <hi>English</hi> Tongue.</p>
            <p>BUT as for the true and genuine <hi>Scotish,</hi> which they now call the Speech of the <hi>Highlanders,</hi> because by them only spoken at this day, it is no other than the antient <hi>Irish,</hi> which the <hi>Scots</hi> brought over with them from thence, when they first came over to inhabit there, as you will find in the Beginning of <hi>Bede</hi>'s History.</p>
            <p>THE sixth Kingdom was that of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">6<hi>th.</hi> Kingdom.</note> which contained <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgshire,</hi> with the Isle of <hi>Ely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE seventh was that of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> containing <hi>Gloucestershire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">7<hi>th.</hi> Kingdom.</note> 
               <hi>Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Rutlandshire, Northamptonshire, Lincolnshire, Huntingtonshire, Bedfordshire, Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamshire, Oxfordshire, Staffordshire, Shropshire, Nottinghamshire, Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> and part of <hi>Hertfordshire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT as for the Names of the Kings who reigned in each of these Kingdoms, till they were all brought under that of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> I shall refer you to the Tables at the end of the third, fourth and fifth Books of this Volume, wherein you have at one view all the Kings that succeeded in each of those Periods, as also those of that part of <hi>Britain</hi> we now call <hi>Wales</hi>; and for the more exact Chronology of the first <hi>British</hi> Princes, I must own my self obliged to the exact account of the Right Reverend the present Lord Bishop of <hi>Bangor,</hi> who I hope one day will let the World see some of his Learned Labours on that Subject.</p>
            <p>THIS is a short Scheme of the several Kingdoms, into which that Part of <hi>Britain</hi> we now call <hi>England,</hi> was divided in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Times.</p>
            <p>I should next proceed to the particular Laws and Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in each respective Kingdom; but since we have no Remains of those left us for want of Letters, before the Preaching of Christianity here, we can only say in the general, that without doubt each of these Kingdoms had its own particular Laws and Customs; and tho they might perhaps differ one from the other in some Points, yet they all agreed in the main, as to the most Material and Fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of their Government, and long received Laws and Customs before ever they arrived in <hi>England,</hi> as proceeding from the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Ancestors.</p>
            <p>AND tho the <hi>English-Saxons</hi> were not immediately derived from the <hi>Germans</hi> but <hi>Goths,</hi> as you will find in the third Book of this Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume; yet since even the <hi>Germans</hi> themselves were derived from the same <hi>Gothick</hi> Original, with all the rest of those Northern People, as the <hi>Sweeds, Danes</hi> and <hi>Norwegians,</hi> as appears by the Agreement of their Language, Customs and Laws; I shall therefore suppose that in the main likewise they agreed with the Antient <hi>Germans,</hi> as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by <note n="*" place="margin">De moribus Germanorum.</note> 
               <hi>Tacitus,</hi> in their Laws, Manners, and Religion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall from him give you some of the most considerable of them, as they are collected by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his Learned Treatise, called; <hi>Jani Anglorum Facies altera.</hi>

Then in this very Council, either one of the principal Men, or his Father, or his near Kinsman, adorned the Youth with the Shield and Lance. This served them instead of a Gown, and was the first Honour of their Youth: before they only seemed as part of the Family, but now they became a Member of the Common-Wealth.</q> And here Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> discovers the first Footsteps of Knighthood.</p>

            </p>
            <p>BUT the Severity of this Punishment, if ever it was in use here, was quite abolished by the <hi>English-Saxons,</hi> as you will find from the Laws about it.</p>

            <p>BUT in this the <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Law differed much from those of the <hi>Germans</hi>; for it was lawful in <hi>England</hi> for Men of Quality to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of their Land by Will (if they pleased) provided it were <hi>Bocland,</hi> (that is Free-Tenure grantable by Deed) as you may find by some Laws in the ensuing Volume; otherwise in Lands held in <hi>Socage,</hi> every Man's Sons inherited all alike: But this law was changed after the Conquest, and no Will could be made of Lands held by Military Service, but they descended entirely to the eldest Son: which Law continued so low as the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th,</hi>
               <note place="margin">32 Hen. VIII. Cap. 1.</note> when the Statute was first made, which gives the Tenant by Knights Service, Power to bequeath his Estate by Will, provided there were enough left to perform the Service.</p>

            <p>IT is absolutely necessary to continue the Enmities of a Father, or near Kinsman, as well as Friendships.</p>
            <p>FROM whence, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> well observes, arose those Family-Quarrels, called in the North of <hi>England,</hi> DEADLY FEUDS, (which you will also find mentioned in the ensuing Collection of <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws) and which are continued in <hi>Scotland</hi> even to this Day.</p>
            <p>BUT to proceed with <hi>Tacitus,</hi> he says, <hi>Nec implacabiles durant: Lui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur enim etiam homicidium certo Armentorum as Pecorum numero, recipít<expan>

            <p>HAVING thus done with the Laws, we shall next descend to the People who practised them.<note place="margin">Adam. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens. Hist. Eccles. Brem. &amp; Hamburg. cap. 5. ex Bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liothecâ Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric.

                  <hi>Nithard.</hi> p. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Nithardus</hi> speaking of his Time, makes them but of three sorts, <hi>scilicet, Ethelings, Frilingues,</hi> and <hi>Lazzi,</hi> that is, Noblemen, Freemen, and Slaves: and it was established as a Law among them, that none of these should transgress the Bounds of their own Condition, by matching with those who were either a Degree above, or below them.</p>
            <p>THIS Custom was also long observed in <hi>England</hi> after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,<note place="margin">Vid. Mag. Charta, C. 6. &amp; Merton.

            </p>
            <p>BUT before we come to treat of the several Degrees of People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovementioned, it is fit we should say something of the Head of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Common-Weal, <hi>viz.</hi> their King; who though he was chosen in all the Kingdoms of the <hi>Heptarchy,</hi> out of the Blood-Royal of <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> their first Leader of this <hi>Gothick</hi> Colony into <hi>Europe,</hi> as appears by their Pedigree at the end of the Book; yet were they at first no better than Generals in War,<note place="margin">Bede Eccles. Hist. Li. 5. Cap. 12.</note> and in time of Peace they had little or no Power, as we may see in <hi>Bede.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR he speaking of the Province of the Hither (i. e. <hi>East) Frize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (from whence he supposes our <hi>Saxon</hi> Ancestors to have come, and to which the two <hi>Hewalds,</hi> the White and the Black, went to preach the Gospel, and were there martyr'd for their Pains) he hath this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Passage, <hi>Non enim habent Regem iidem antiqui Saxones, sed Satrapas plurimos suae Genti praepositos, qui ingruente Belli Articulo mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunt aequalitèr sortes, &amp; quemcunque sors ostenderit, hunc tempore Belli Ducem omnes sequuntur, &amp; huic obtemperant; peracto autèm Bello, rursum aequalis potentiae omnes fiunt Satrapae:</hi> i. e. <q>For the Antient <hi>Saxons</hi> (says he) have no King, but several Noblemen of their own Nation set over them, who on the breaking out of any War, cast Lots, and on whomsoever the Lot happened to fall, all the People during that War, follow and obey him as their General; but when the War was over and at an end, all these Lords again became of equal Power.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AND it is likewise very observable, that neither <hi>Bede</hi> nor any other <hi>German</hi> Author, who relates the Story of the <hi>Saxons</hi> being invited by the <hi>Britains</hi> over hither, ever mention their being sent by any of their Kings, but only by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Nation in general: and if it continued thus in <hi>Bede</hi>'s Time, it ought reasonably to be concluded, that it was
<pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:93814:22"/>
likewise so before their coming over, unless any Man can shew me some better Authority than ever I have yet met with to the contrary.</p>
            <p>AND that this likewise continued so, not only in <hi>Bede</hi>'s Time, but many Years after, may appear from this Testimony of <hi>Johan. Pomarius</hi> in his Saxon Chronicle, which, tho written in Latin, yet not being able as yet to procure the sight of it, I shall give you what he says almost to the same effect out of <hi>Verstegan</hi>'s <hi>Restitution of decayed Intelligence</hi>;<note place="margin">Verstegan. Chap. 3. pag. 68, 69.</note> 
               <q>As for the General Government of the Countrey, they ordained twelve Noble-men, chosen from among others for their Worthiness and Sufficiency. These in the Time of Peace rode their several Circuits, to see Justice and good Customs observed; and they often of Course, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t appointed Times, met all together, to consult and give Order in Publick Affairs; but ever in Time of War one of these twelve was chosen to be King, and so to remain as long only as the War lasted; and that being ended, his Name and Dignity of King also ceased, and he became as before: and this Custom continued among them until the Time of their Wars with the Emperor <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> at which time, <hi>Wittekind</hi> one of the Twelve as aforesaid, a Nobleman of <hi>Angria</hi> in <hi>Westphalia,</hi> bore over the rest the Name and Authority of King; and he being afterwards by the means of the said Emperor converted to the Faith of Christ, had by him his mutable Title of King turned into the induring Title and Honour of Duke; and the eleven others were in like manner by the said Emperor advanced to the honourable Titles of Earls and Lords, with Establishment for the continual remaining of these Titles and Dignities unto them and their Heirs; of whose Descents are since issued the greatest Princes at this present in <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>FROM what now I have given you, I think nothing is more evident than that the Government of the Antient <hi>English Saxons</hi> was rather Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocratical than Monarchical: and admitting they allowed the King they had set over them somewhat more Power than those Noblemen abovementioned, by whom they where governed in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in time of Peace; yet was this Power of theirs far short of that absolute Dominion which Dr. <hi>Howell</hi> in his Discourse of the Polity of the <hi>English-Saxons</hi> supposes, (tho without any just Ground,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Howell's <hi>General History, Part.</hi> 4 <hi>Fol.</hi> 272.</note>) that these Kings enjoyed, and therefore he would have it, <q>That the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was Monarchical, and that not only in respect of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Kingdoms during the <hi>Heptarchy,</hi> which had their peculiar Kings, but even of the whole Body of the Nation, which was usually commanded by one of the Seven; of all which <hi>Bede</hi> takes notice in his Time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT if every one of these Kings were no more a Monarch, than he who was sometimes Supream or Chief above the Rest, I doubt he will fall very short of that Title, which is not found either in <hi>Bede,</hi> or in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals, or yet in any other Antient Writer before the Conquest, until the Time of King <hi>Edred,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT I have said enough to confute this Notion, I hope, in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor's next Argument is from the Nature of the Monarchy, which he says, <q>We must believe at the first followed the Condition of the Tenure, absolute Conquests and Territories,<note place="margin">Id. ibid.</note> both got and held by the Sword alone, usually producing absolute Governments,
<pb n="xl" facs="tcp:93814:23"/>
which many times either by reason of the infirm Foundation laid by the Conquerors themselves, the Humour of the People not induring such Subjection, or other Accidents, change into more Moderate and less Arbitrary. That <hi>Hengest, Aella,</hi> and the other Captains, where they first erected their Dominations, governed their Souldiers, whom now being Kings they called Subjects, with as great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and as full Command as formerly, we little doubt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IN answer to this, and to shew you, that notwithstanding what this Author hath alledged, we have still great reason to doubt the Truth of it, as being founded on no Authority, but rather the quite contrary appears; I shall therefore only desire the Reader in the first place to take notice, that it is no good Argument at all to say, that because the <hi>Saxon</hi> Princes were Conquerors by the means of their Followers, therefore they must have submitted themselves absolutely to their Dominion, when the War was over.</p>
            <p>FOR the better Proof of which, I would farther intreat the Reader to observe;</p>
            <p>FIRST, That those Princes or Generals over the <hi>English-Saxons;</hi> (thô all of them were descended from <hi>Woden</hi> their Common Ancestor,) knew no such Power as that of Kings of Home, (according to <hi>Bede</hi>;) or if we believe <hi>Pomarius,</hi> the Title of King lasted at the most no longer than the War: nor could those Princes be made Kings by their own Nation before they came over, since being only meer Souldiers of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, they had as yet conquered no Dominions, from whence they could receive that Denomination: so that then it must fall out, that they could only be so by the <hi>Election</hi> of their Souldiers and Followers, that came over along with them; which may be also proved from the ensuing <hi>Annals</hi> themselves.</p>
            <p>FOR first they call <hi>Hengest</hi> and <hi>Horsa</hi> the two Brothers, who came over hither only <hi>Heretogan,</hi> i.e. Leaders or Captains of the <hi>Jutes</hi> that accompanied them, as you may see <hi>An.</hi> 449. of these <hi>Annals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOR secondly, do they begin the Reign of <hi>Hengest</hi> till the Death of <hi>Horsa</hi> his Brother, <hi>Anno</hi> 455. six Years after his coming over: so that it is plain he could have no other Right to his Kingdom of <hi>Kent,</hi> but <hi>the free Election of the People</hi> that came over with him, or else followed him not long afterwards.</p>
            <p>THE like I might say of all the rest of the Kingdoms of the <hi>Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchy</hi> for the same Reason, were there no express Authorities to prove it, which yet also are not wanting.</p>
            <p>FOR as to the Kingdom of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> (which afterwards swallowed up all the rest) our <hi>Annals, Anno</hi> 495. tell us <q>Of <hi>Cerdic,</hi> and <hi>Cynric</hi> his Son, their landing in <hi>Britain</hi> with five Ships, and having fought with the <hi>Britains,</hi> they about six Years after their coming over, upon their conquering the Countrey of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> became their first Kings: which is further confirmed under <hi>Anno</hi> 519. where it is expresly related, that <hi>Cerdic</hi> and <hi>Cynric</hi> then began their Reigns over the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Kingdom. So likewise in <hi>Anno</hi> 547. it is there said, that <hi>Ida</hi> began first to reign; from whom is derived the Royal Stock of the <hi>Northumbrian</hi> Kings.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AND yet we find from <hi>Nennius</hi> and <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and all our other Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians who treat of this Matter, that <hi>Octa</hi> and <hi>Ebusa,</hi> Son and Nephew to <hi>Hengest,</hi> had landed in the Northern Parts of <hi>England</hi> not long after
<pb n="xli" facs="tcp:93814:23"/>
               <hi>Hengest</hi> himself; and having conquered those Countries, they and their Descendants ruled there for near 100 Years, tho without the Title of Kings, but only as subordinate Lords or Earls under the Kings of <hi>Kent,</hi> till this <hi>Ida</hi> obtained the Kingdom; but whether by Succession or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> cannot tell us, but rather inclines to the latter: and tho it be true, that these <hi>Annals</hi> mention no other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the <hi>Heptarchy</hi> than these three last; yet it appears from very good Testimonies in the ensuing History, that <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Cambridgshire,</hi> being the Countrey of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> were conquered by them under several petty Princes, that ruled there long before <hi>Vffa,</hi> who was made the first King of that whole Countrey.</p>
            <p>THE like I may say for the <hi>Mercian</hi> Kingdom, where <hi>Creoda,</hi> or <hi>Crida,</hi> began his Reign about <hi>Anno</hi> 585. above 60 Years after the <hi>East-Angles</hi> first settled in those Parts.</p>
            <p>HAVING now, I hope, sufficiently proved this Point against the Learned Dr. <hi>Howell,</hi> I think it will plainly follow, that all those Kings above-mentioned could have no other Title to their Crowns besides <hi>Election,</hi> who from Captains and Generals in time of War, became Kings in time of Peace over the Countries they had conquered.</p>
            <p>I will here therefore leave it to the Impartial Reader, to consider; whether what Dr. <hi>Howell</hi> asserts is at all likely to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That the Power of these Kings commencing by the Sword, was as abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in Time of Peace as in that of War: for we plainly see, that these were a free People, and it is in no ways probable that they should, contrary to the Genius of so noble and free a Nation, submit themselves to the absolute Dominion of one Man, who owed his delegated Power to themselves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BESIDES this, the original Constitution of all these several King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms speaks the quite contrary; for we find in the following History, frequent mention made of great Councils of the <hi>Wites,</hi> i. e. the chief, or wise Men of the whole Kingdom, which Councils were established to curb the exorbitant Power of their Kings; since by these they were <hi>elected,</hi> and by these too they were likewise often <hi>deposed,</hi> when ever their Tyranny rendered them insupportable; as you will see in several Instances when you peruse the following Books in this Volume.</p>
            <p>AND thus having traced as far as we are able the Original of the first <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Kings, we shall now in the next Place treat of the manner of their Succession to the Crown, which some of our Modern Authors fancy to have been by a Lineal Succession, because we find the Son to have often succeeded the Father in most of these Kingdoms for several Descents. But if this should be granted, yet is it no good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove a Lineal Succession by Blood: for tho I am sensible that the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals, as well as all other Historians, are very obscure in this Point, not declaring which way those Princes came to the Crown, whether by Succession or Election, because it was omitted in the old <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> out of which they wrote, and which we find very short in that particular; yet this will by no means warrant those Kingdoms to have been only Successive, as some Men fondly suppose; seeing we may observe, that in the <hi>German</hi> Empire, (which every one knows to be Elective) the Son hath succeeded the Father, or a younger Brother the Elder, for above 150 Years, ever since the Time of the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Brother to <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Fifth</hi>; however I hope no Body will

have the Confidence to affirm, that the Empire hath been only Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, and not Elective all this while.</p>
            <p>THE same I may say concerning the Succession of our <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Kings, in which tho we find the Son often succeeded the Father, or one Brother another, yet does not this prove that the Succession went by right of Inheritance, as it does at this day.</p>
            <p>I MAY say the like as to <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> the latter of which has been by Succession but little above fourscore Years from <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Ninth</hi>; and as for the former, it has become so even in our own Memories: and yet for many Successions in both these Kingdoms, he that was the next Heir by Lineal Descent, was most commonly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen King after the Death of his Father, Uncle or Brother; but before this Election he could claim no Legal Right to the Crown by the Laws of these Kingdoms, of which I shall give you divers Instances. And I think we may affirm this of all the Kingdoms of the <hi>Saxon Heptarchy</hi>; where tho the <hi>Mycel-Gemots</hi> commonly obliged themselves to choose one of the Blood-Royal, and the next Heir rather than any other, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he were equally fit to govern, especially if he were recommended or designed for Successor by the Will of the last King; however in this they took a great Latitude, as will evidently appear in the pursuit of this Discourse.</p>
            <p>BUT I must confess the manner how the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings came to the Throne is but darkly expressed by the words <hi>FENG to RICE</hi> in <hi>Saxon,</hi> in Latin <hi>Regnum capessit,</hi> which we have commonly rendered, <hi>succeeded in,</hi> or <hi>to the Kingdom:</hi> yet those words do not signify any Lineal Succession, but are often promiscuously used, when the next Successor could have no Title but Election, as shall be farther shewn by and by.</p>
            <p>NOW the best way to prove this, I think, will be briefly to survey the Successions of each Kingdom, and the several Breaches and Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that were made therein, upon this supposed Lineal Succession. And first,<note place="margin">1. Kent.</note> to begin with the Kingdom of <hi>Kent,</hi> of which we indeed have scarce any more than the bare Names of the Kings, with but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little of their Actions, for about four Descents, till <hi>Ethelbert</hi> the first Christian King there began to reign, only that the Son still succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Father.</p>
            <p>SO likewise from this <hi>Ethelbert</hi> to <hi>Earcombert</hi> his Grandson, for two Descents more we find the like seeming Lineal Succession; yet for all this doth it not therefore follow, that there might not have been either elder Brothers, or the Sons of them, who were excluded during that Time; seeing that we only meet with the next Successor mentioned, without telling us whether there were not such Heirs put by: for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Year 640. we learn from our <hi>Annals,</hi> that <hi>Earcombert</hi> King of <hi>Kent</hi> succeeded <hi>Eadbald</hi> his Father abovementioned, who yet left an elder Son named <hi>Ermenred,</hi> that according to the Course of Lineal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent ought to have succeeded to the Kingdom before his younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Earcombert:</hi>

            </p>
            <p>AFTER him <hi>Egbert</hi> his Son succeeded, leaving a Son called <hi>Eadric,</hi> yet he did not succeed as he ought to have done (according to our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Opinions) by Hereditary Right, but <hi>Lothaire</hi> his Uncle, that kept
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:93814:24"/>
the Kingdom twelve Years from him: But whether he came in by the Testament of his Brother, or Election of the People, or by both, neither <hi>Bede</hi> nor any other Author give us an Account; tho it must be confessed, that this <hi>Eadric</hi> was discontented at his being thus put by, and therefore fled to the <hi>South-Saxons,</hi> and joined with them who were then in actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al War against <hi>Lothaire</hi>; who happening to be worsted in the Fight where this <hi>Eadric</hi> commanded, and dying of the Wounds he therein received, <hi>Eadric</hi> succeeded, but whether by Right of Lineal Descent, or Election, is no where said: Nor doth his thus making War upon his Uncle prove his Right, since we find that King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Elder</hi> suffered the like Disturbance from Prince <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> Saxon Annals, <hi>Anno</hi> 901, 902.</note> 
               <hi>Ethelwald,</hi> the Son of King <hi>Ethelred</hi> his Father's elder Brother, as you will see in the beginning of the Reign of that King, which ended not but with the Life of the said Prince <hi>Ethelwald,</hi> who pretended to the Crown.</p>
            <p>NOR were Foreign Princes any better satisfied with <hi>Eadric</hi>'s Right; for <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> tells us, that <hi>Ceadwalla</hi> made War upon him,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and destroyed his Countrey, to revenge the Death of King <hi>Lothaire</hi> his Predecessor.</p>
            <p>BUT after this <hi>Eadric,</hi> two Princes, called <hi>Webba</hi> and <hi>Seward,</hi> held the Kingdom, which must certainly have been by Election, because it is not related, whether they were of the Royal Family or no; but they reigned not long, for <hi>Whitred</hi> Brother to <hi>Eadric</hi> succeeded them: after whom this Kingdom seems to have gone in a Lineal Succession for three Descents, as far as to his Sons <hi>Eadbert, Ethelbert,</hi> and <hi>Alric</hi>; tho these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might have been also elected, for ought we know to the contrary, for they all reigned successively after each other: But whether any of these left Sons is uncertain, for <hi>Malmesbury</hi> tells us, <q>That after them the <hi>Kentish</hi> Royal Family decaying, any bold Aspirer, whom Wealth or Faction made formidable, obtained that Crown, but how?</q>— Most Likely by the Election of their Great Councils, for Usurpations by Force could not well be practised in Kingdoms where (there being no standing Army) the King in great measure depended on the general good Will of the People.</p>
            <p>BUT as for the next Kingdom, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>South-Saxons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. South-Saxons.</note> there is so little said of them by any of our Historians, and they were so soon swallowed up by the Kingdom of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> that we can only guess they succeeded to the Crown, but it is most probable, that it was after the same manner as the Kings did in all the other Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>I should next treat of the Kingdom of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> according to the course of Time wherein it begun, but I intend to reserve that to the last, because it is from them that all our <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended, till the Conquest.</p>
            <p>AND therefore I will now give you a brief Succession of the Kings of the <hi>East-Saxons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. East-Saxons.</note> where they seem to have followed in a Lineal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent, till <hi>Sebert,</hi> the first Christian King; and he dying, as <hi>Bede</hi> relates,<note place="margin">Bede <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. &amp; Flor. Wig. <hi>pag.</hi> 690.</note> left his three Sons joint Heirs of his Kingdom, tho we can find no more than the Names of two of them, <hi>viz. Sexred</hi> and <hi>Seward,</hi> who being both slain in Battel against the <hi>West-Saxons, Sigbert,</hi> the Son of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> succeeded him.</p>
            <p>THIS I remark to shew you, that this Kingdom did not always go according to a Lineal Succession, for all the three Brothers were Heirs alike: and that the Testament of the King alone had not the Power to
<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:93814:25"/>
do this without the concurring Assent of the Great Council of the Kingdom, I shall prove when I come to discourse of the Succession of the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Kings; since it is most reasonable to suppose the same General Laws or Constitutions concerning it to have been in use among them all, until any one can prove the contrary.</p>
            <p>I have no more to say concerning these Kings of the <hi>East-Saxons,</hi> but that after the Death of King <hi>Sebbi</hi> or <hi>Sebba,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. Cap. 12.</note> we are informed by <hi>Bede,</hi> that <hi>Siggard</hi> and <hi>Swithered</hi> his two Brothers, reigned jointly after him, which I observe only the further to make good the former Instance, of more Heirs than one at a Time.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4. Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumbers.</note>AND now I come to the Kingdom of the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> the Lineal Succession whereof being so often broken, and so very perplexed, it would be tiresome to give you all the particular Instances in which the next Heirs by Descent were put by, and other Princes of the Blood more remote chosen by the People in their Rooms: so that from <hi>Ida</hi> their first King for near three hundred Years, we shall scarce ever find that Crown settled in any one Family for above three Descents, but that it was still translated to some other Prince of the Blood Royal,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogies of the</hi> Saxon <hi>Kings at the end of</hi> Florence <hi>of</hi> Worcester.</note> which seems to have been the most general Rule they observed, as any one may see, who will please to consult their Pedigree at the end of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> of <hi>Worcester.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND indeed the frequent Rebellions of this Nation against their Kings, and the Deposing of them so as they did, being not only observed, but frequently blamed by <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> and our other Antient Historians, I shall not draw any Precedents from thence, but such as we find in the very beginning of this Kingdom, and before that People were infected with that turbulent Humour of casting off their Kings whenever they displeased them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 1. Cap. 3.</note>TO begin with <hi>Ida</hi> their first King, 'tis true <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> will not affirm, whether he made himself King by his own Power, or else became so by Consent of the People, because he owns it to be very much in the dark; yet <hi>Henry Huntington</hi> is positive, <hi>that he was chosen to this Dignity by the Consent of the Great or chief Men:</hi> but after his Death, tho a Prince of great Merit, the Kingdom became divided, and <hi>Adda</hi> his Son only obtained the Kingdom of <hi>Bernicia,</hi> whilst <hi>Aella,</hi> the Son of <hi>Yffi,</hi> of the same Royal Lineage, succeeded him in that of <hi>Deira,</hi> which how it could be unless by Election, I do not understand.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Florence <hi>in the Place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove cited.</hi>
               </note>NOR did any of the Sons of <hi>Adda</hi> succeed him in that Kingdom, but three other Princes, <hi>viz. Glappa, Theodulf,</hi> and <hi>Frethulf,</hi> whose Relation to the <hi>Northumbrian</hi> Blood Royal, our Authors do not declare, nor yet how they stood in Consanguinity to each other; only they say that after them, <hi>Thedorick</hi> first, and then <hi>Ethelrick,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Ida,</hi> succeeded in the <hi>Bernician</hi> Kingdom, which how they could do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than by Election I do not find.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Flor. Ibid.</note>AND note, that these six Princes last mentioned, governed <hi>Bernicia,</hi> whilst <hi>Aella</hi> being yet alive still reigned in <hi>Deira</hi>; nor did he, for all he ruled above thirty Years, long secure the Kingdom to his Son <hi>Eadwin</hi>; for he was soon expelled by <hi>Ethelfrith,</hi> the Son of King <hi>Ethelrick,</hi> who forced him to fly his Countrey, whilst he commanded both Nations for several Years, till being at last overcome and slain in Battel by <hi>Redwald</hi> King of the <hi>East-Angles; Eadwin</hi> again recovered not only his own Kingdom, but that of <hi>Deira</hi> also.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:93814:25"/>BUT yet he did not enjoy what he had thus obtained many Years, for he lost his Life in a fight with <hi>Penda</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> and then <hi>Osric</hi> his Cousin-German succeeded him in <hi>Deira,</hi> whilst <hi>Eanfrid,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ethelfrith,</hi> was made King of <hi>Bernicia</hi>; but he soon after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing killed by <hi>Cadwallo</hi> King of the <hi>Britains, Oswald</hi> his Brother succeeded him, who being also slain by the said <hi>Penda, Oswin</hi> his younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was made King, whilst <hi>Oswy,</hi> the Son of <hi>Osric,</hi> reigned in <hi>Bernicia,</hi> and having cruelly murdered <hi>Oswin,</hi> made himself Master of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; but whether it was done by the Power of the Sword, or by Election, since our Authors are silent in this Matter, I will not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. I have only set down the Succession of these first Kings, to shew that there was not often any Hereditary Lineal Right to the Crown observed among them.</p>
            <p>AS for the Kingdom of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">5. East-Angles.</note> the Antient <hi>Annals</hi> and Histories of that Countrey having been all destroyed by the <hi>Danes,</hi> we have little more than the Names and Successions of their Kings left us, nor yet of those higher than <hi>Vffa,</hi> (tho it is certain the <hi>East-Angles</hi> had fixed themselves in those Parts long before he began to reign) and those but very lame and defective: For from <hi>Ethelbert</hi> who was murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by King <hi>Offa,</hi> for above threescore Years, we have no Account of what Kings reigned in that Kingdom; and it is certain, that upon the Death of <hi>Offa</hi> and his Son <hi>Egfert,</hi> the People of the <hi>East-Angles</hi> freed themselves from the <hi>Mercian</hi> Yoke; but about the Year 855. (as <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser</hi> in his <hi>Annals,</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> assure us) <hi>Edmund,</hi> (after called the Martyr) being then but fifteen Years old, was Elected and Crowned King of the <hi>East-Angles</hi> by the general Consent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that Kingdom; but they do not inform us who was his Father; yet if we may give Credit to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Tinmouth</hi> in his <hi>Sanctilogium,</hi> he makes him to be the Son of one <hi>Alcmond</hi> a Nobleman of the Blood Royal.</p>
            <p>I have given you this Instance, to let you see that they were no Strangers to Elective Kings; for if his Blood alone would have fixed in him any Title, there would have been no need at all of his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but this King being afterwards murdered by the <hi>Danes,</hi> they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so seized on his Kingdom, and held it till it was reconquered by King <hi>Edward</hi> the Elder.</p>
            <p>NOR have we much to remark of the manner of the Succession of the <hi>Mercian</hi> Kings;<note place="margin">6. Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</note> for tho the Son very frequently succeeded the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or one Brother or Cousin to another, yet it is as certain that it must have been chiefly by an Elective Right, notwithstanding the <hi>Annals</hi> and our Historians do not expresly mention it: <note n="*" place="margin">Florence Wig. <hi>p.</hi> 691.</note> For <hi>Beornred</hi> having in the Year 755. treacherously slain <hi>Ethelbald</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians, Offa</hi> a young Man of the Blood Royal, raising Forces against him, and having driven him out of the Kingdom, he was, as <note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 852. <hi>printed at the end of</hi> Script. post Bedam.</note>

               <hi>Matthew Westminster</hi> words it, <q>He was by the unanimous Consent of the Clergy and Laiety of that Kingdom, Elected and Crowned King; which without doubt was done in a Great Council of that Nation, for we find that to secure the Crown to his own Family, <note n="*" place="margin">Page 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> in his Life of King <hi>Offa,</hi> tells us, that in a Great Council assembled at <hi>Calcuith, Anno</hi> 787. he caused <hi>Egfrid</hi> his eldest on, a comely and valiant Youth, to be crowned King, who
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:93814:26"/>
jointly reigned with him as long as he lived: and that this could not be done without the Consent and Election of this Great Council, appears by the twelfth Law or Decree made therein,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>FROM hence the Reader may observe, that he who is appointed to be Elected, is also called <hi>Haeres Patriae,</hi> to let us see, that he who was to come in by an Elective Right, was also accounted the Right Heir of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>AFTER <hi>Egfrid</hi> succeeded <hi>Kenwulfe,</hi> who certainly came in by Election, being himself very remote from the Crown; for <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> says,<note place="margin">Lib. 1.</note> he was in the fifth Descent from <hi>Cenwalch</hi> the Brother of <hi>Penda,</hi> one of the first <hi>Mercian</hi> Kings; a Title too stale in that Age to give a Right without a new Election, since his Predecessor King <hi>Offa</hi> could not be admitted to obtain the Crown without it, tho he was in Blood almost as near to it,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>BUT were there no other Proof of this, the Decree of the Council abovementioned sufficiently evinces this Kingdom to have been elective at that Time.</p>
            <p>TO <hi>Kenwulf</hi> abovementioned, succeeded <hi>Kenelme</hi> a Child, and he is the first Example of an Infant's succeeding when there was a Male Heir of full Age alive,<note place="margin">

               <hi>viz. Ceolwulf</hi> the Brother of the said <hi>Kenwulf</hi>; which I suppose proceeded from the great Love they bore to their late deceased King, and some Aversion they had to his Brother, as you will see by and by.</p>
            <p>BUT if <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Tinmouth</hi> in his <hi>Historia Aurea,</hi> (still in Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script in several Libraries) may be credited, tho he wrote long after those Times, yet out of antient Manuscripts not now extant, he says expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Kenelmum aetate parvulum, sed animo &amp; pietate magnificum, ad Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem elegerat Amor Populi sui,</hi> i. e. the Love of the People had <hi>elected Kenelm</hi> to be their King, tho an Infant in Years, yet remarkable for Spirit and Piety.</p>
            <p>BUT King <hi>Kenelme</hi> being murdered by his Sister <hi>Quendride,</hi> and she frustrated in her expectations of the Crown, our <hi>Annals</hi> tell us, that then <hi>Ceolwulf</hi> was advanced to it, (without making any mention at all of King <hi>Kenelme</hi>) and the next Year expelled his Kingdom by the Faction and Contrivance of <hi>Bernulph</hi> a potent Nobleman, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever no way related to the Blood-Royal, and so consequently could have no other Title or Pretence but Election, however unjustly he came by it.</p>
            <p>THE like I may say of his Successors <hi>Ludican, Wiglaff, Bertwulf,</hi> and <hi>Burhed</hi>; the former of whom was only a remote Kinsman of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulph</hi>'s, and the three latter were all of them of quite different Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: but as for <hi>Ceolwulf,</hi> who was the last that bore the Title of King of <hi>Mercia,</hi> he deserves not to be mentioned, being only for a Time made King by the <hi>Danes</hi> to serve their turns, and was quickly after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by them. I have but lightly run over the Succession of these
<pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:93814:26"/>
Kings, and refer you for the farther Proof to the following History, where you will find all the Authors fairly quoted.</p>
            <p>BUT now I come to the Succession of the Kings of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">7. West-Saxons.</note> from whom our <hi>English</hi> Monarchs derive their Pedigree to this Day: and therefore I shall be the more particular in my Quotations out of the Antient Authors concerning the Right which those Princes had to the Crown, and the manner how they attained it.</p>
            <p>AS for <hi>Cerdic,</hi> and his Son <hi>Cynric,</hi> the first Kings of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> it is certain that they had not the title of Kings before they came over, which the <hi>Annals</hi> place under <hi>Anno</hi> 495. as we have already observed: nor is it likely that they claimed by any other Title than the Election of their Followers, because we find by the same <hi>Annals,</hi> that it was above twenty Years before they took upon them the Name of Kings; for <hi>An.</hi> 519. they say, <hi>Hoc Anno Cerdicus &amp; Cynricus Occidentalium Saxonum Regnum susceperunt; à quo usque die regnavit Occidentalium Saxonum proles Regia.</hi> This Year <hi>Cerdic</hi> and <hi>Cynric</hi> began to reign over the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> and from that Time the Royal Race of the <hi>West-Saxons</hi> have reigned to this day.</p>
            <p>BUT it must be confessed, that the Crown from <hi>Cerdic</hi> to <hi>Ceawlin</hi> went lineally in three Descents from Father to Son; however this doth not prove but that it might also have been Elective for the Reasons at first given.</p>
            <p>THE same may likewise be said for <hi>Ceolric</hi> and <hi>Ceolwulph</hi> the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews of <hi>Ceawlin</hi>: but that the former of these came in by Election is apparent; for upon <hi>Ceawlin</hi>'s being expelled the Kingdom, <hi>Cwichelme</hi>

            <p>AND tho this Example may seem to make good Dr. <hi>Brady</hi>'s asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Kings might bequeath the Crown to whom they would, yet that they could not do this without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Estates of the Great Council of the Kingdom, I hope I shall fully make out before I have done.</p>
            <p>BUT this Queen <hi>Sexburge</hi> dying, or being deposed, as <note n="*" place="margin">Flor. <hi>Hist.</hi> Anno 672.</note> 
               <hi>Matth. West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> relates, after somewhat more than a Year's Reign; <hi>Aescwin</hi> a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Kinsman succeeded her, tho he was six Degrees off from <hi>Cerdic</hi> the
<pb n="xlviii" facs="tcp:93814:27"/>
first King; and therefore he is not likely to have had any better Title than his Predecessors, for the Reason already given under the Kings of <hi>Mercia</hi>; and if that will not satisfy, then I say <hi>Centwin</hi> his Successor was much nearer to the Crown than he, being younger Son to <hi>Cynegils,</hi> who had reigned within two Successions before, as you may see by the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree at the end of the fourth Book, where are exactly set down either from the <hi>Annals,</hi> or Antient Manuscripts, in what manner these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Kings stood related to each other.</p>
            <p>BUT before the Death of <hi>Aescwin,</hi> it seems by the <hi>Saxon Annals, Anno</hi> 785. That <hi>Ceadwalla,</hi> a Prince of the Blood Royal, taking Arms, began to contend for the Crown of that Kingdom, tho he was very far removed from it, being descended from <hi>Cutha</hi> the younger Son of <hi>Ceawlin.</hi>

               </note> Preface to this King's Laws, where he is expresly so called.</p>
            <p>BUT as for the five next Princes, <hi>viz. Athelhard, Cuthred, Sigebyrht, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newulf,</hi> and <hi>Bryhtric,</hi> it is most probable that they neither could have any other Title than <hi>Election,</hi> since being only Kinsmen and not Sons to each other, it is very unlikely that so many of them should have died without leaving any Son to succeed them: which is also as good as confessed by <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> in these words, <hi>Nam &amp; ipse</hi> Brihtricus, <hi>&amp; caeteri infra</hi> Inam <hi>Reges, licet naturalium splendore glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antes, quippe qui à</hi> Cerdicio <hi>originem traherent, non parum tamen à linea Regiae stirpis exorbitaverant</hi>; i. e. For tho <hi>Brihtric</hi> himself, and the rest of the Kings since <hi>Ina,</hi> tho boasting of their Royal Lineage, as draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Origine from <hi>Cerdic,</hi> yet did they not a little deviate from the right Royal Line, that is, they were not Lineal Heirs by Blood: and if so, what other Right could they have except that of Election by the People? Therefore since neither our <hi>Annals,</hi> nor any other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor that I know of, have given us their Pedigrees, I have been forced to set down the Names of these last five Kings by themselves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to shew you what Relation they had to each other.</p>
            <p>BUT as for <hi>Cynewulf,</hi> that he could have no Title to the Crown but what Election gave him, it is certain; for our <hi>Annals</hi> inform us under <hi>Anno</hi> 755. <q>That he with the Wife and Noble Men of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> deprived King <hi>Sigebert</hi> of the whole Kingdom for his Cruelty and Injustice.</q> And certainly then the same Authority that Deposed the one, must also Elect and set up the other; since he could by no means succeed him as his Heir, because we find in the same <hi>Annals,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 755.</note> 
               <q>That <hi>Cyneheard</hi> the Brother of the late King <hi>Sigebert,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring against King <hi>Cynewulf,</hi> set upon him in a certain Woman's House at <hi>Merton</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> and there slew him; and was at last also killed himself: after whom <hi>Bryhtric</hi> began to reign, who was in a Right Line descended from <hi>Cerdic.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT we are now come out of the Dark into clearer Times; for K. <hi>Egbert</hi> succeeding <hi>Bryhtric,</hi> came in by Election, being, as our <hi>Annals</hi>

            <p>AND that by this word <hi>Ordinatur,</hi> cannot be meant any Lineal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in <hi>Ethelwerd,</hi> will further appear from him, where he says,<note place="margin">Lib. 4. Cap. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Post Obitum Athulfi Regis, ordinati sunt filii ejus in Regnum</hi>; which must be understood either an Appointment by the Father's Will, or else a new Election, since these Sons of King <hi>Aethelwulf</hi> could never be thus appointed or ordained Kings by the Law of Lineal Succession, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause each of these Brothers, except the Eldest, left Sons.</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> does likewise as good as own,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. Cap. 1.</note> that King <hi>Egbert</hi> came in by Election, when he says, that upon the Death of <hi>Brytrich, Egbert</hi> at the frequent Solicitations of his Countrey-men coming over into <hi>Britain; Móx<expan>

            <p>AND either to this Time, or rather to the latter end of this King's Reigny (as you may find in the ensuing History) I suppose may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred what the Author of the <hi>Mirror of Justices,</hi> in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Book, says concerning the first Election of a King to reign over the rest of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Sovereign Princes, <hi>viz.</hi>

which Laws he there a little after recites:) I say, this Passage may serve as a great Proof, not only of this King's Election to be the Chief or Supream King of all <hi>England,</hi> but also it gives us the Original Contract, if I may so call it, which he then entred into with this Nation, at the time of his Election and Coronation.</p>
            <p>TO <hi>Egbert</hi> succeeded <hi>Athelwulf</hi> his Son; who, though I grant it is no where said that he was Elected, yet if his Father were so (as it is most evident he was) it is not likely that the Kingdom should become Successive in one Descent, especially if we consider the manner of all his five Sons coming to the Kingdom, either in his Life-time, or after him.</p>

            <p>AND as for his other four Legitimate Sons, <hi>Ethelbald,</hi> the Eldest of them, did by the General Consent of the King and the whole Nation, (which amounts to an Election) <note n="*" place="margin">

And by the virtue of his Testament, confirmed likewise by the General Consent of the Kingdom, <hi>Ethelbald</hi> remained only King of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> whilst <hi>Ethelbert</hi> his second Brother reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Kent,</hi> as also over the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>South-Saxons,</hi> which had been his Brother <hi>Aethelstane</hi>'s share, who died without Issue for ought we can find.</p>
            <p>BUT after King <hi>Ethelbald</hi>'s Death, <hi>Ethelbert</hi> succeeded in the whole Kingdom; and he likewise dying, <hi>Ethelred</hi> his Brother succeeded him, after whose Death also <hi>Alfred</hi> the youngest Brother came to the Throne.</p>
            <p>THIS short Account is the Truth of the Matter of Fact; yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a great deal to be said to have it well understood; since Dr. <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> in his true and exact History of the Succession of the Crown, <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. of his <hi>Introduction,</hi> will needs derive the whole Right which these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had to the Kingdom, from the Entail of it by their Father's Will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovementioned; and if the Testament of a King then Regnant could dispose of the Crown to the prejudice of the Right Heirs by Lineal Descent, I desire this Learned Antiquary to satisfy us how this could consist with his supposed Right of Lineal Succession at the same Time?</p>
            <p>BUT the Truth is, this worthy Doctor, as well as the Author of <hi>the great Point of Succession discussed,</hi> here deal with us like some crafty. Witnesses, who indeed speak the Truth, but not the whole Truth, if they find it will make against them. For the Doctor in the first Place conceals, and the nameless Author of the other Pamphlet, either wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully or ignorantly, positively denies, that King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s three elder Brothers, who reigned before him, left any Issue Male; whereas it is most certain that two of them, if not all Three, left Sons behind them: for <hi>Athelm</hi> and <hi>Aethelwold,</hi>

                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Alfredi</hi> Regis.</note> (to whom King <hi>Alfred</hi> by his Testament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queaths divers Lands therein mentioned, under the Title of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Sons) are supposed by the Learned Author of the Notes upon his Life, to have been the Children of King <hi>Ethelbald</hi> his eldest Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="li" facs="tcp:93814:28"/>
tho whether they were so or no I will not be so confident as to affirm. But that they were either the Sons of <hi>Ethelbald</hi> or <hi>Ethelbert</hi> is most certain, and consequently they ought to have reigned before him who was but their Uncle.</p>
            <p>AS for King <hi>Ethelred,</hi> he had also two Sons if no more, <hi>viz. Alfred,</hi> supposed to be Grandfather to <hi>Elthelwerd</hi> the Historian, and <hi>Oswald,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Speed,</hi> in the Reign of this King, says was a Witness to his Father's Charter to the Abbey of <hi>Abington</hi>: but the Author of the Notes to King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Life being convinced of this,<note place="margin">Fol. 19.</note> to solve an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection so directly contrary to the received <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of a Lineal Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, is feign to take refuge in a supposed Arbitrary Power the <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Kings had of disposing of their Kingdom as a <hi>Fee-Simple:</hi> which is such a Conceit, that if he would but have been pleased to put down the first seven or eight Lines of King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Testament, instead of that Scrap he has there given us of it, it would have sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed that Assertion. Therefore since he has been so fair as to give us this Testament at full length in the second Appendix to the said Life, I will make bold to transcribe so much as will be enough to evince the contrary, and leave the Reader to consult the rest at his leisure.</p>

            <p>NOW I would gladly be satisfied from the Author abovementioned, in these three Points, if King <hi>Aethelwulf</hi> had full Power to bequeath the Kingdom to his Sons, and to turn it from a <hi>Fee-Simple</hi> into a <hi>Fee-Tail</hi>;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FIRST,</hi> Why K. <hi>Alfred</hi> in the very first Line of this Testament calls himself King of all <hi>West-Saxony</hi> by the Divine Donation, and the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> and <hi>Consent</hi> of the whole <hi>West-Saxon Nobility,</hi> if he had not been <hi>Elected,</hi> or at least <hi>Confirmed</hi> by them in the Possession of the Crown, so bequeathed to him by his Father?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SECONDLY,</hi> When he here summoned them to be Witnesses to the compleating and confirming of this his last Will, why he distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes that private Inheritance which he had given him by the Grace of God, and the Favour and Bounty of his Nobility and People, from that publick Inheritance which his Father had bestowed on him and his two Brothers, so that the longest Liver of them should enjoy the whole Kingdom? But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THIRDLY,</hi> if his Father's Testament alone could have given his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and him an absolute Right to the Kingdom, how came it to pass that he stiles himself King by the Assistance of Arch-Bp <hi>Athelred,</hi> with the Assent and Consent of the whole <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Nobility? and what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity was there for him to summon them only to be Witnesses thereof,
<pb n="lii" facs="tcp:93814:29"/>
if their Confirmation were no ways necessary thereunto? I fear he will not be able to answer these Queries, unless he will grant that this last Will of King <hi>Alfred</hi> wanted as much their Confirmation, as that of his Father had done before.</p>
            <p>
               <q>AND this may be plainly proved, not only from the beginning of the Will it self, but also from an Agreement therein recited to have been made between the three Brothers abovementioned; by Virtue of which they dying, the whole Inheritance of King <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was <hi>devolved</hi> upon him by a certain Charter made in the <hi>Mycel Gemote,</hi> or General Council of the Kingdom, at <hi>Langdene</hi>; which being read before the Witnesses, (<hi>i.e.</hi> all the Estates) of all <hi>West-Saxony,</hi> they unanimously declared, that they knew of none who had a juster Title than himself.</q> And yet you must not forget, that both his said elder Brothers had left Children behind them.</p>
            <p>WHEREUPON the said Estates farther declared thus, <hi>Ecce jam habes tuam hereditatem iterum in Manibus tuis. Nunc de Bonis &amp; Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessionibus conde Testamentum tuum; lega, &amp; dona tuo proximo sanguini vel Amicis tuis &amp; Cognatis sicut tibi placuerit.</hi> To which the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>Et Omnes illi firmit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>FROM whence it is most evident, that it was to the Consent of the Estates of the Kingdom that King <hi>Alfred</hi> owed the Power of making this his last Will, and of bequeathing only the private Inheritance which his Father and Brothers had left him; and where, tho he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of the several Lands therein mentioned, first to his eldest Son <hi>Edward,</hi> then also to his younger Son, whom he does not name, and his two Nephews and others; yet he pretends to make no Bequest of the Crown, which one would think he would by no means have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, had he had any such unlimited Prerogative abstracted from the Consent of the Kingdom, to have disposed of, or entailed it, as his Father had done before him, tho not without or against the said Consent, to which it appears every one of his Predecessors chiefly owed his Title.</p>
            <p>NOW give me leave to draw two Conclusions from the whole Will, which I have almost translated <hi>verbatim</hi> at the end of King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Life in the following History.</p>
            <p>FIRST, That it was then indeed in the Power of the King to make his Will, and bequeath his Kingdom; but how? with the Consent and Assent of the Estates; and the Person or Persons to whom it was thus entailed, came in successively by virtue of such Designation: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note n="*" place="margin">De Gestis Alsredi.</note> 
               <hi>Asser</hi> very well and justly calls King <hi>Athelwolf</hi>'s Will, <hi>Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam, vel Commendatoriam Epistolam,</hi> i. e. a recommendatory Letter to the Estates of the Kingdom to elect his Sons; but if no such Bequest was made, and so confirmed as aforesaid, then the Estates of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom were at liberty to choose the Eldest Son, or next Brother or, Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, if he were of fit Age and Capacity, for their Sovereign; nay, the King's Testament or Adoption preceding, a meer Stranger to the Royal Blood might be capable of succeeding, provided he also had the Election or Confirmation of the Great Council of the Kingdom, as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Queen <hi>Sexburgha</hi> the Wife of King <hi>Cenwalch</hi> had; and as you will further find <hi>Harold,</hi> the Son of Harl <hi>Godwin,</hi> obtained, towards the end of this Volume.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="liii" facs="tcp:93814:29"/>SECONDLY, That the Person so designed was called the <hi>Heir</hi> of the preceding King, and enjoyed the Inheritance thus acquired <hi>Jure Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditario,</hi> i. e. by Hereditary Right, tho he was not the next Heir in Blood to him that went before him, as is clearly manifest from this Testament it self, wherein King <hi>Alfred</hi> plainly distinguishes between the Dominions which he and his Brother King <hi>Ethered</hi> were to conquer, and those that came to him <hi>Jure Haereditario,</hi> i. e. by Hereditary Right, <hi>viz.</hi> by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Father King <hi>Ethelwulf</hi>'s Will; therefore when the Crown fell to King <hi>Alfred</hi> by virtue of that Entail, Abbot <hi>Ailred</hi> expresly says, <hi>ad Eum totum Regnum jure Haereditario transiit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Genealog. Regum Ang. Col. 351.</note> &amp;c. And yet King <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi> could not be Lineal Heir to his Brothers, since they both left Sons behind them, as hath been already observed.</p>
            <p>AND in the same Sense King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> in the Preface to his Charter to the Abbey of <hi>Westminster</hi> (which you may find at large in <hi>Monast. Anglican.)</hi> having recited the Miseries the Nation had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone from Wars raised by Strangers,<note place="margin">1 Vol. pag. 59.</note> which were to that extremity, <hi>Adeo ut pene periclitata sit haereditaria Regum Successio, magnúm<expan>

Thus also <hi>Eadmerus</hi> relates, that Duke <hi>William</hi> claimed the Crown of <hi>England, Jure Haereditario,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hist. Ecclesi. pag. 5.</note> from King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor</hi>'s Testament; but certainly the Duke could have no pretence to it by Right of Blood, being no ways descended from the <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Kings.</p>
            <p>SO that it is a manifest Errour in some of our Modern Writers of the Succession, who will needs understand these words, <hi>jus Haereditari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> to have been used in the same Sense in those, as they have been taken in later Ages, since the Crown came to be claimed by a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal Descent of Blood: But indeed <hi>Eadmerus</hi> his Sense of these words is most agreeable to the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> wherein he is called <hi>HAERES EX<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ASSE</hi>; who comes in as Heir by Testament to the whole Inheritance, tho no way related to the Testator; for that Law describes an Heir thus, <hi>Haeredis significatione, omnes significari Successores, etsi verbis non expressi:</hi> And therefore our <hi>Bracton</hi> derives the word <hi>Haeres, ab Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditamento</hi>; for says he, <hi>Inheritance is a Succession to all the Right which the Predecessor</hi> (he does not say Ancestor) <hi>enjoyed:</hi> from whence you may observe, that in <hi>Bracton</hi>'s Time, this word <hi>Haeres</hi> was not even by our Law limited only to an Heir by Blood or Descent.</p>
            <p>HAVING said thus much of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings Accession to the Throne, as far as King <hi>Alfred</hi>; I shall in the next Place proceed to give you the Succession of all the rest, down to the pretended Conquest, from the most Antient Authors who lived either a good while before, or else not long after that Time, before Men's Minds became prejudiced by those Notions of Lineal Succession, which began to be in Vogue about the Time of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> when the Crown had descended from Father to Son for four Descents, tho not without somewhat that was tantamount to an Election in that Prince himself.</p>
            <p>TO King <hi>Alfred</hi> succeeded his Son King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Elder,</hi> who, not having the Crown bequeathed to him as his Father had, <hi>viz.</hi> by Will,

            <p>AFTER this <hi>Edward</hi>'s Decease, <hi>Aethelstan</hi> his Son succeeded him, whom most Antient Writers, as well in Print as Manuscript, relate to have been begot of a Concubine, and therefore could have no Legal Right: and tho <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> endeavours to palliate it, yet he is almost forced to confess it at last by saying, <hi>Sed Ipse praeter hanc No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam (si tamen vera est) nihil ignobile habuit,</hi> i. e. that he had no other Mark of ill upon him but this, if it were true.</p>
            <p>BUT tho Dr. <hi>Brady</hi> will have this Prince to have succeeded wholly by virtue of his Father's Will,<note place="margin">Lib. 2.

That thereupon by the General Consent of the Chief Men or Estates of the Kingdom, <hi>Athelstan</hi> being <hi>Elected,</hi> was Crowned at the Royal Town of <hi>Kingston:</hi> but this did not agree with the Doctor's Hypothesis, and so I suppose he thought it best to leave it out.</p>
            <p>THIS Passage was borrowed by <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> from a much Antienter Author, <hi>viz.</hi> the Compiler of the <hi>Saxon Annals,</hi> who under <hi>Anno</hi> 925. expresly tells us, That he was <hi>Electus in Regem, &amp; apud</hi> Cingestune <hi>Consecratus,</hi> Elected King, and Anointed at <hi>Kingston:</hi> from both which it appears, that the Election and Consecration were then two different Actions.</p>
            <p>AFTER <hi>Athelstan,</hi> succeeded <hi>Edmund</hi> his Brother, and indeed ought to have been King before him, he being Legitimate, whereas the other was only a Natural Son.</p>
            <p>BUT he dying, and leaving two Sons behind him, <hi>Edwy</hi> and <hi>Edgar,</hi> neither of them, but <hi>Edred,</hi> King <hi>Edmund</hi>'s younger Brother, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Throne; which how it could be done unless by Election, I confess I do not understand: and therefore this might be omitted as to this Prince, as well as the Coronation of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> and other of our <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Kings are both by our <hi>Annals</hi> and Antient Historians; for I must own I cannot find that the word <hi>Electus</hi> is used in his Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Throne: for <hi>Ethelwerd</hi> tells us expresly, <hi>ejus Successor extitit</hi> Eadred <hi>in Regnum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ethelwerdi <hi>Histor.</hi> Cap. 7.</note> 
               <hi>suus quippe frater</hi>; that <hi>Eadred</hi> his Successor obtained the Kingdom, because he was his own Brother.</p>
            <p>AND in this he is followed by <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> who expresses it thus, Edredus <hi>proximus haeres fratris succedens, Regnum suscepit; Edred</hi> succeeding as next Heir to his Brother, enjoyed the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Brady</hi> in his above-cited Treatise, will needs solve this open Breach of a Lineal Succession, by the Nonage of King <hi>Edmund</hi>'s Sons, and the Nation's then being under great Difficulties. The former of these
<pb n="lv" facs="tcp:93814:30"/>
I grant to be a good Excuse, but as for the latter it was not at all true; since King <hi>Edmund,</hi> by subduing both <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Cumberland,</hi> driving the <hi>Danes</hi> out of the one, and delivering the other to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> to be enjoyed as his Vassal, had thereby sufficiently settled the Peace of the Nation: so that let the Doctor take his choice, and either allow this King to have succeeded by Election, or else if by Succession, it was no Lineal one, as the Doctor would maintain, because these Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians tell us, he succeeded his Brother as <hi>next Heir,</hi> when at the same time they confess too, that he left two Sons behind him; and if the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's lying then under great Difficulties, will be a good Warrant to set by a Right Heir, I desire he would be pleased to satisfy me, why it may not always be a justifiable Reason to make a Breach upon the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in the like Cases?</p>
            <p>AS for <hi>Edwy,</hi> Nephew to this King, indeed I do not find any thing mentioned in the <hi>Annals</hi> or other printed Authors of his Election; yet the Antient Manuscript Life of Arch-bishop <hi>Odo,</hi> now in the <note n="*" place="margin">Otho. D. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Cottoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Library, and which seems to have been written by some Monk not long after that Time, says expresly, <hi>Edwigus</hi> Filius <hi>Aedmundi in Regem ELECTVS est.</hi> Nor indeed could he succeed as Heir to his Uncle, for his Lineal Right was before him: nor does the Expression commonly used in the <hi>Saxon Annals, viz.</hi> FENG <hi>to</hi> RICE, (which is rendered in the Latin by <hi>capessit Regnum</hi>) signify any thing concerning the manner of this or any other King's coming to the Crown. <q>These being,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>AND these are not the only words made use of in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicle when an Election is signified; for <hi>An.</hi> 1015, we find these words concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Election of K. <hi>Edmund Ironside,</hi> that the <hi>Wites</hi> or <hi>Wise</hi> Men who were at <hi>London,</hi> and the <hi>Citizens, Gecuron, Eadmund</hi> to <hi>Cynge,</hi> i. e. chose <hi>Edmund</hi> King. So likewise <hi>Anno</hi> 1036. concerning the Election of <hi>Harold Harefoot,</hi> that all the Thanes North of <hi>Thames,</hi> and the Seamen of <hi>London, Gecuron Harold,</hi> to rule over all <hi>England:</hi> the same word we also find <hi>Anno</hi> 1066. where after the words <hi>FENG to RICE</hi> abovementioned, these likewise follow, <hi>and eac men Hine haer to Gec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AND that there may be no dispute about the meaning of this word <hi>Gecuron,</hi> we find it often used in these <hi>Annals</hi> for the <hi>Election</hi> of the Pope, as <hi>e. g.

            <p>AFTER the Death of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> our Historians tell us, there was a Contest between Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Ethelred,</hi> concerning their Succession to the Crown; which, says <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> was set on foot by <hi>Elfrida</hi> the Wife of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> and Mother-in-Law to <hi>Edward</hi>; which divers of our Authors tell us, was because those of her Faction pretended that <hi>Egelfrida,</hi> the Mother of Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> was never married to King <hi>Edgar</hi>; for otherwise there could have been no Colour why the elder Son should not be preferred before the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, especially since he was also recommended by his Father's Will: and indeed it is left very much in the dark, whether the Lady last men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned were ever <hi>Edgar</hi>'s lawful Wife or not: For the <hi>Annals,</hi> and more Antient Historians, are wholly silent in it; nor does any Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter make mention of that Lady as King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Wife, till <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford,</hi> who lived in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Third.</hi>

               <q>Some Elected <hi>Edward</hi> the King's Son <hi>Edmund,</hi> some his Brother <hi>Ethelred</hi>; wherefore the Arch-Bishops, <hi>Dunstan</hi> and <hi>Oswald,</hi> with the Bishops, Abbots, and very many No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen being gathered together, Elected <hi>Edward,</hi> (as his Father had commanded) then Consecrated and Anointed him King.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS shews it so plain from the Doctor's own Translation of the words, that Prince <hi>Edward</hi> (notwithstanding his Father's Will) was first Elected, and then Anointed King, that I needed not have added any further Remark to it, had he but faithfully rendred the Latin Text as he ought to have done; but he has unhappily left out one material small word, and that is <hi>Electum,</hi> that so the unwary Reader might not observe that those Kings were first Elected, before they could be Anointed.</p>
            <p>BUT I have not yet done with this Prince, nor with the Doctor, for <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Tinmouth</hi> in his <hi>Historia A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rea</hi> (now in Manuscript in the <hi>Lambeth</hi> Library) tells the Story of this Election thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>EDGARO Rege mortuo, &amp;</hi> Edwardo <hi>ad Regnum relicto, dum quidam principes acquiescere nollent,</hi> Dunstanus <hi>arrepto Crucis Vexillo in medio constitit,</hi> Edwardum <hi>illis ostendit, elegit, sacravit</hi>; that is, King <hi>Edgar</hi> being Dead, and <hi>Edward</hi> left Heir of the Kingdom, whilst some of the Chief Men would not Consent to it, Arch-Bishop <hi>Dunstan</hi> taking up the Banner of the Cross, placed him in the midst, and shewing him to them, he Elected, and then Consecrated him.</p>
            <p>SO that I will leave it to the impartial Reader to judg, whether these words <hi>Eligerunt</hi> and <hi>Electum,</hi> here signify no more than <hi>recognoverunt,</hi> 
               <q>As the Doctor will have them, <hi>i. e.</hi> they acknowledged, owned, submitted unto him as their King, as his Father had commanded,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>True and exact History of the Succession,</hi> &amp;c. Fol. 7.</note> and by Will appointed, as the Doctor has been pleased to Paraphrase it.</q> But I would advise him in the next Edition of this Treatise, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he writes upon this Subject, to shew us an Example out of any Antient <hi>Roman</hi> Authors, nay, any Glossary of the more barbarous Ages, where the word <hi>Electus</hi> or <hi>Eligerunt,</hi> signifies <hi>Recognition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR as to all his Instances out of his own Glossary at the end of his <hi>Introduction,</hi> instead of Presidents, I may boldly say they are only meer Cavils against the Right and Manner by which the Kings or Bishops he there mentions came to obtain their Thrones or Sees;<note place="margin">Pag. 37.</note> for that the Monks who wrote of them, ever meant by such their expressions that they were truly Elected, he himself cannot deny, which also proves the Falshood of that his Assertion, wherein he affirms, <q>That the old Monks said every one was ELECTED, that had not an HEREDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TARY Title;<note place="margin">Ibid pag. 38.</note> and tho he was set up by the ART or VIOLENCE of a Faction, or <hi>obtained</hi> the Crown by <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Arms</hi> without Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yet according to them he was ELECTED, when as the PEOPLE only <hi>received</hi> and <hi>submitted</hi> unto them when they could not help it, and it may be because there was much Shouting, and many Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations at his Reception.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT I hope the Presidents I have here now given will evince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, since of all the Kings that have been already mentioned to have been <hi>Elected,</hi> I desire him to shew me one, concerning whom the word <hi>Election</hi> can mean no more than a bare <hi>Recognition</hi> or <hi>Acclamation</hi> of the People, when they first received and submitted to them; whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="lviii" facs="tcp:93814:32"/>
they were then solemn and deliberate Acts of Choice by the whole Estates of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>BUT since the Instances that the Doctor brings for this his Opinion are all after his Conquest, when he fancies the Nation totally subdued, and their Liberties lost; I shall reserve the Consideration of the Force of those Authorities till my <hi>Introduction</hi> before my next Volume, if God shall grant me Life to finish it.</p>
            <p>BUT to return from whence some perhaps may think this too long a Digression.</p>
            <p>KING <hi>Edward</hi> being murdered by the Instigation of his Mother, <hi>Ethelred</hi> his Brother succeeded him; and tho the Doctor again seems to put some stress on the words <hi>FENG to RICE,</hi> as if he had come in by Lineal Succession, yet that he was also <hi>Elected</hi> as well as his Brother, I desire he would consult the Antient <hi>Annals</hi> of the Monastery of <hi>Thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library,<note place="margin">Bibliothec. Cotton.

            </q>
            <p>AND for a farther Confirmation of the Truth of this Oath, there is also an Antient <hi>Saxon</hi> Copy of it, together with a Latin Version which differs but little from that now cited, and is said to be that Oath which Arch-Bishop <hi>Dunstan</hi> administred to this King at <hi>Kingston</hi> on the Day of his Coronation; at the end of which Oath it is also specified, <hi>that so long as the King observes it, he will thereby obtain both Earthly Glory, and also God's Mercy; so if he breaks it, he will still pass from bad to worse, as well in respect of himself, as People, unless he repent.</hi> This you will find printed both in <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> in the second Book of King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Life,<note place="margin">Cleopatra. B. 13.</note> printed at <hi>Oxford</hi> from an Antient Manuscript in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="lix" facs="tcp:93814:32"/>I shall not trouble you with a verbal Translation of all this long Oath; only observe thus much, that hereby it appears plainly that King <hi>Ethelred</hi> had been before <hi>Elected</hi> by the Clergy and Laity, in order to be <hi>crowned</hi> King; which is further confirmed by that old <hi>Saxon</hi> imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Ritual of the Coronation of the <hi>English Saxon</hi> Kings and Queens, part of which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> hath given us in his <hi>Titles of Honour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Seld. <hi>Tit. Hon.</hi> pag. 116.</note> where in the Prayer upon the Anointing we find these words, <hi>Respice propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius ad preces nostrae humilitatis, &amp; super hunc famulum tuum illum quem supplici Devotione in Regem</hi> ANGLORUM <hi>vel</hi> SAXONUM <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritèr ELIGIMVS, Benedictionum tuarum Dona multiplica</hi>;<note place="margin">Id. pag. 140.</note> as also what follows in the same Chapter, in the Blessing after the Coronation, in giving him the Scepter. <hi>Benedic, Domine, hunc PRE-ELECTVM Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipem, qui Regna omnium Regum à saeculo moderaris.</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p>NOW from both these Places above quoted, we may safely conclude, that an Election did most commonly precede the Coronation of our <hi>English Saxon</hi> Kings; which I think is made so evident by these Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, that it needs no farther Enlargement; nor should I trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my self about it were it not to expose the Obstinacy of some Men, as well as to continue the Series of this Succession (which perhaps would seem lame to others without it) down to the Conquest.</p>
            <p>TO go on therefore where we left off, after the Death of King <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> the <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> tell us, that <hi>Omnes Proceres, qui in</hi> Londonia <hi>erant, &amp; Cives, eligerunt</hi> Eadmundum <hi>in Regem,</hi> i. e. All the Chief Men, (or <hi>Witan,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Saxon,</hi> i. e. Wise Men) that were at <hi>London,</hi> and the Citizens, chose <hi>Edmund</hi> for their King; and yet he was his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's eldest Son, tho whether Legitimate or not is uncertain: for we do not find any antient Author till after the Conquest, that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Ethelred</hi>'s being married to the Mother of this Prince; and if he was not, this Son of his could have no other Title but Election. This is also confirmed by <hi>Ingulph,</hi> who says, <hi>Cui</hi> (Ethelredo) <hi>successit in Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> Londonensium <hi>&amp;</hi> West-Saxonum <hi>Electione,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ingulph. fol. 507. <hi>b. lin.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <hi>Filius ejus primogenitus</hi> Edmundus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> i. e. <hi>Edmund</hi> his eldest Son succeeded his Father <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> by the Election of the <hi>Londoners</hi> and <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>BUT tho our <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> are silent of it, yet an Antient Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script Chronicle, wrote about the Time of the Conquest, now in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library, relates,<note place="margin">Otho. D. 7.</note> that about the same Time that King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> was thus Elected, <hi>Episcopi, Abbates, qui<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> Nobiliores</hi> Angliae Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutum <hi>in Regem eligere,</hi> the Bishops, Abbots, and several of the Chief Men of <hi>England</hi> chose <hi>Cnute</hi> for their King; which is also confirmed by <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> in these words under this very Year. <hi>Post cujus mortem maxima pars Regni tàm Clericorum quàm Laicorum in unum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregati, pari consensu Cnutonem in Regem eligerunt, &amp; ad eum Suthampto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam veniens pacem cum eo pepigerunt, &amp; fidelitatem jurabant</hi>; i. e. after whose Death (<hi>viz.</hi> of King <hi>Ethelred</hi>) the greatest part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as well of the Clergy as Laity, being met together, chose <hi>Cnute</hi> for their King; and coming to <hi>Southampton</hi> made Peace with him, and swore Fidelity; but he there says nothing of his Coronation.</p>
            <p>THESE Testimonies concerning <hi>Ethelred</hi> and <hi>Edmund</hi> being thus plain, I confess Dr. <hi>Brady</hi> has been so just as to cite them, and fairly to translate that Passage in <hi>Ingulph</hi> by the word <hi>Election,</hi> whereas it
<pb n="lx" facs="tcp:93814:33"/>
should have been <hi>Recognition,</hi> if it had suited with his Hypothesis; as he does also that of <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> rendring the word <hi>Eligerunt,</hi> by <hi>chose</hi> him King: if therefore it were a true Election in one case, then surely it must be so in the other, for the same Reason.</p>
            <p>BUT the nameless Author of <hi>the Great Point of Succession discuss'd,</hi> tho he does wilfully conceal all the printed Authorities above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,<note place="margin">Page 5.</note> yet being hard press'd with this Passage of King <hi>Cnute,</hi> has no other way to evade it, but by saying, <q>That <hi>Canutus,</hi> by the Terror of his Arms, having the greatest part of the Island, at his Devotion, forced them to acknowledg and receive him for their King, which they being under an apparent Force, could not refuse to do.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE falseness of which Assertion I will not go about to prove in this Place, but refer the Reader to the ensuing History, where he will find that the Persons abovemention'd, were not so forced by the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of his Arms, as to acknowledg him for their King, since <hi>London</hi> (then, as still) the Capital City of the Nation, with many others of the Nobility, had before Chosen King <hi>Edmund,</hi> who by their Assistance was strong enough immediately after his Election to fight the <hi>Danes</hi> at the great Battel at <hi>Assendune</hi>; and therefore if voluntarily, yet it was treacherously done of them, to quit the Prince who ought to have been Elected, and to choose a Stranger and an Invader over his Head: and whether the Gentleman this Author writes against, had <hi>ridiculously</hi> called King <hi>Cnute</hi>'s Accession to the Throne an <hi>Election,</hi> as he would have it, I shall leave to the impartial Reader's Judgment.</p>
            <p>AFTER the Death of King <hi>Cnute,</hi> our <hi>Annals</hi> relate, that at a <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tena-Gemot</hi> or Great Council being held at <hi>Oxford,</hi> Leofricus <hi>Comes, &amp; omnes propè Thani à Boreali parte Thamisis, &amp; Nautae de Lundonia eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerunt</hi> Haroldum <hi>in Regem totius Angliae, dum ejus Frater Hardcnutus esset in Denmearcia,</hi> i.e. <hi>Leofric</hi> the Earl, and almost all the Thanes North of the <hi>Thames,</hi> and the Sea-men of <hi>London,</hi> chose <hi>Harold</hi> King of all <hi>England,</hi> whilst his Brother <hi>Hardecnute</hi> was in <hi>Denmark</hi>; which is also confirmed by <note n="*" place="margin">Fol. 509. a Line 2.</note> 
               <hi>Ingulph,</hi> and <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 12.</note> 
               <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> who far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther report, <q>That the <hi>English</hi> had a Mind to chuse <hi>Edward</hi> the Son of <hi>Ethelred,</hi> or at least <hi>Hardecnute</hi> the Son of <hi>Cnute</hi> by <hi>Emme</hi> his Wife, the Widow of King <hi>Ethelred,</hi> who was then in <hi>Denmark.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntington</hi> says expresly, <hi>Haroldus filius Cnuti in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem Electus est.</hi> But <hi>Radulphus de Diceto</hi> is yet more express as to this Election of <hi>Harold,</hi> as appears by this Passage under <hi>An.</hi> 1038. <hi>Haroldus Rex Merciorum &amp; Northymbrorum, ut per totam regnaret Angliam, à Principibus &amp; omni Populo Eligitur,</hi> i. e. <hi>Harold</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians</hi> and <hi>Northumbers,</hi> that he might reign over all <hi>England,</hi> is Chosen by the chief Men and all the People: whence you may observe, that tho he were then King of the <hi>Mercians</hi> and <hi>Northumbers,</hi> yet that still needed a new Election to make him King of all <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW if this were so, as the Doctor himself has ingenuously cited it in his said Treatise; I desire he would let us know, where was then the Right of Lineal Succession, when the People of <hi>England</hi> would fain have chosen <hi>Edward,</hi> who could not be Right Heir of the Crown so long as the Children of his Elder Brother were alive, tho then in Exile? nor could <hi>Hardecnute</hi> have any Right so long as <hi>Harold</hi> his Elder Brother was alive; whom also, as our Historians relate, his Father had appointed Successor at his Death, tho whether that be true or no, is much to be doubted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="lxi" facs="tcp:93814:33"/>BUT the Author of the aforementioned <hi>Great Point of Succession, &amp;c.</hi> (to evade this Proof of <hi>Harold</hi>'s Election) will have all this Point in Controversy to have been, who had the most Right, and best Title to the Crown of those two, <hi>Harold</hi> or <hi>Hardecnute,</hi> and that Earl <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> objected <hi>Harold</hi>'s Illegitimacy, and the Will of the deceased, King, of all which there is not one word mentioned in any of our most An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Historians, only he cites a Scrap in the Margin, as he thinks, ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AND <hi>Henry Huntington</hi> goes yet a step higher, and writes thus, Edwardus <hi>cum paucis venit in</hi> Angliam,<note place="margin">Lib. 6. p. 365.</note>

            </p>
            <p>BUT the Doctor very cunningly conceals all this concerning his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,<note place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 9.</note> and only gives us a shred out of <hi>Guilielmus Gemeticensis</hi> in these words, Hardecanutus Edwardum <hi>totius Regni reliquit haeredem</hi>; that is, left <hi>Edward</hi> Heir of the whole Kingdom: but so far indeed the Doctor is in the Right,<note place="margin">Page 8.</note> 
               <q>That he could be no other than a Testamentary Heir, there being other Heirs of the Right Line, both of <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Danish</hi> Blood before him.</q> But it may well be doubted, whether the Author last mentioned, being a Foreigner, may not be mistaken, if he means the words <hi>haeredem reliquit,</hi> for a Bequest by Will, since no <hi>English</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian that I know of mentions any such thing: and indeed it is highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that this Prince made any Will at all, since all Writers agree that he died suddenly at a Drunken Feast, in the very Flower of his Age; and as it is not likely he made any Will before, so it was impossible he could do it at his Death.</p>
            <p>BUT this Election of King <hi>Edward</hi> farther appears, from the mean and abject Carriage which this Prince shewed, (as you will find <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi>) towards Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> when he was so far from claiming the Crown, that he only desired he would save his Life, till the Earl encouraging him, put him in hopes of obtaining the Kingdom upon Promise of marrying his Daughter; which he would never have done, had he had so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>air a Pretence as the last Will of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Hardecnute</hi> to recommended him to the favour of the Estates of the Kingdom; and if that alone would have done, to what purpose should he need afterwards to be Elected?</p>
            <p>
               <q>THIS is in part acknowledged by the Doctor; but to palliate it, he will have <hi>Godwin,</hi> (a Council being immediately called) by his Reason and Rhetorick to make him King; (it seems then he was to be made so) but he dares not say one word of his <hi>Election,</hi> for fear it would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the Cause which he has so strenuously laboured to advance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AND therefore he thinks he has now nothing more to do, but to expose and ridicule the Legend of the Abbot of <hi>Rievalle</hi> in making <hi>Edwards</hi> the <hi>Confessor</hi> to be elected King in his Mother's Womb: which tho I grant to be as absurd as to drink Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> his Health before he is born, yet the Abbot had certainly no ground for this Story, unless he had been sufficiently convinced that this was an Elective Kingdom in the Time of King <hi>Ethelred</hi> his Father.</p>
            <p>BUT if the Reader desires further Satisfaction concerning the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of this King's Election, I shall refer him to the Antient <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> of the Church of <hi>Winchester,</hi> which I have faithfully transcribed out of the first Volume of <hi>Monasticon Anglicanum,</hi> and inserted into this Volume under <hi>Anno</hi> 1041. where he will find the whole History of this Prince's Election and Coronation, written by a Monk of that Church not long after the Conquest; these <hi>Annals</hi> are also in Manuscript in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library, to which I must likewise by the Favour of its ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Possessor, own my self highly obliged for several considerable Remarks in this History of the Succession of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings.</p>
            <p>BUT to draw to a Conclusion upon this Subject; King <hi>Edward</hi> (as appears by our <hi>Annals</hi>) in the Year 957, sent over for his Cousin Prince <hi>Edward,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 189. n. 20.</note> sirnamed the <hi>Out-Law,</hi> Son of King <hi>Edmund,</hi> out of <hi>Hungary,</hi> as <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> relates, <hi>Illum se Regni haeredem constituere,</hi> that
<pb n="lxiii" facs="tcp:93814:34"/>
he might appoint him Heir of the Kingdom: which had been a very idle Thing had the Kingdom been Hereditary, and that it had been his undoubted Right by Proximity of Blood.</p>
            <p>THIS Prince dying soon after his coming over, we no where find, that King <hi>Edward</hi> ever offered to do the like for his Cousin <hi>Edgar Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>; but on the contrary forgetting his own Family, <hi>Ingulph</hi> tells us, that the Year before his Death,<note place="margin">Fo. 512. n. 40.</note> he sent <hi>Robert</hi> Arch-Bp of <hi>Canterbury</hi> his Ambassadour, to let <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> know, <hi>Illum designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum esse sui Regni successorem,</hi> that he had appointed him Heir of his Kingdom: which relation tho I have proved to be false as to Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Robert,</hi> towards the end of this ensuing History; yet might it be true in the main, and some other Bishop might have gone over to Duke <hi>William</hi> on that Message; but however, for all this, King <hi>Edward</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards adopted Earl <hi>Harold</hi> upon his Death-bed, for which we have very good Authority, since our <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> testify it in these words,<note place="margin">Page 172.</note>

            <p>THIS is also confirmed by the History of the Abby of <hi>Ely,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten not long after the Conquest, and lately published by the Learned Dr. <hi>Gale, Quo (Scil. Edwardo) tumulato,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>FROM all which remarkable Testimonies I shall draw these two Conclusions.</p>
            <p>FIRST, That this Testamentary Designation of <hi>Harold</hi> by King <hi>Edward</hi> for his Heir, was not sufficient alone to make him King, but it also required a subsequent Election of the Estates of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, That there is an apparent Distinction here made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Election and Consecration.</p>
            <p>AND I think this enough, had I no more to say, to settle this Point; but to let the Reader know the utmost that may be objected against these Authorities, I must freely confess, that divers Writers of good Credit and Reputation, who lived after the Conquest, viz. <hi>Ingulph</hi> of <hi>Croyland, William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury, Ailred</hi> Abbot of <hi>Rievalle,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntington,</hi> look upon this Donation of King <hi>Edward</hi> as a meer Pretence, invented by the <hi>English</hi> in Prejudice of the <hi>Norman</hi> Duke.</p>
            <p>BUT how they will be able to answer those plain and full Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I have before cited, I know not: for <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was also forced to confess, that King <hi>Harold</hi> claimed not only by virtue of <hi>Edward</hi>'s Designation, but by the Election of the Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Kingdom, as appears by this Memorable Passage,<note place="margin">VVill. Malmesbur. de Gestis An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorum <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. Fol. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>THIS shews, that it would have been a most notorious Falshood for <hi>Harold</hi> thus to have gone about to impose upon Duke <hi>William,</hi> had there never been any such thing as a Real and Solemn Election, which our abovementioned Authors have related.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Brady<hi>'s Answer to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum. Antinor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> fol. 238.</note>NOR is Dr. <hi>Brady</hi>'s Objection against this at all material, in saying, that those who thus set him up, were only a <hi>Court Faction,</hi> for the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> all <hi>England</hi> over could never have <hi>notice</hi> to <hi>come</hi> to, or <hi>send</hi> their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives</hi> to such a <hi>Solemnity,</hi> as to <hi>elect</hi> and <hi>crown</hi> him <hi>King</hi> in four and twenty Hour's Time; and therefore should his <hi>Election</hi> be <hi>granted,</hi> he could not be <hi>chosen</hi> by the <hi>People,</hi> who had neither <hi>Notice</hi> nor <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> of it, but only received and submitted to him as their King.</p>
            <p>NOW in answer to this I need only say, that if the Doctor would have been so fair as to have consulted Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>'s first Volume of Councils, or the first Volume of <hi>Monasticon Anglicanum,</hi> he would have found in both of them, (in the Charters of the Foundation of the Abby of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and the History of that Church printed in the Latter) that it was not (as he says) <hi>never to have been imagined</hi>; for it was really true, that the Estates of the Kingdom did meet a little before Christmass, <hi>(secundùm Morem,</hi> according to Custom) and not only so, but were expresly summoned to be present at the Great Solemnity of the Consecration of that Abbey, which was, as our <hi>Annals</hi> inform us, on St. <hi>Innocent</hi>'s day, and the King dying on the Twefth-day following, this Great Council (which certainly was a full one) was so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then Dissolved, that it chose <hi>Harold</hi> for their succeeding King, as the said <hi>Annals</hi> relate: The nicety of the Dissolution of a Parliament upon the King's Decease not being at that time known.</p>
            <p>I think this is sufficient to answer all that the Doctor has, or I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose can say upon this Head; therefore I will now leave it to the Reader to consider, how far any of his Assertions are true.</p>
            <p>AS first, <q>Whether the sure Rule of Succession was either Right of Blood?</q>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>True and exact History of the Succession,</hi> Fol. 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>OR Secondly, <q>Whether the bare Nomination or Appointment of the preceding King, was then thought and allowed as Cause suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the Father to prefer his Brother's Son before his own, or a Bastard before his Lawful Issue, or that the Instances which he hath produced will be able to make it out; or else whether those very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, which I have here set in their true Light, do not directly evince the contrary?</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIRDLY, Whether from this foregoing History of the Succession, it appears also to be true what he asserts, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That from <hi>Egbert</hi> the first <hi>Saxon</hi> Monarch,<note place="margin">Id. Fol. 9.</note> to <hi>Ethelred</hi> the last by Right of Blood, we do not read of many Elections for the space of two hundred and sixteen Years; and that those we meet with are bound and limited by Proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Blood, or Nomination of the Successor by the Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, and that where the word <hi>Election</hi> or any thing in that Sense is used, it signifies only a Recognition and Submission?</q> And I will now leave it to the Reader's Judgment, if I have not given sufficient Instances to the contrary in every one of these Particulars, there being
<pb n="lxv" facs="tcp:93814:35"/>
not above two Kings in all this long Series of more than two hundred and sixty Years, concerning whom I have not brought express Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies from Authors of undoubted Credit both in Print and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script, of their <hi>Election</hi> by the Estates of the Kingdom. Or,</p>
            <p>FOURTHLY, Whether his last Assertion be any truer than the former, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That the <hi>Danish</hi> Kings,<note place="margin">Id. ibid.</note> after <hi>Sweyn</hi> had conquered the Kingdom, (whose best Title was the Sword) either brought hither the Custom of the Predecessor, naming or giving the Kingdom to the Successor, as probably it might have been practised in their own Kingdoms, or used it as they found it here practised by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings?</q> Or whether the Authorities I have already cited do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly prove, that every one of the three <hi>Danish</hi> Kings came in by <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,</hi> and that <hi>Harold Harefoot</hi> was the only Prince of those Three, who could make any pretence to it by Testament?</p>
            <p>AND as for the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings that reigned before them, how far they by their last Wills alone could dispose of, or entail the Crown, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the concurrent Assent and Consent of the Great Council of the Kingdom, I refer the Reader to that part of King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Will, I have here made use of for his farther Satisfaction, if he have still any doubt left about it.</p>
            <p>I have now dispatched this exact and faithful History of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of our <hi>English Saxon</hi> Kings, in which I am not conscious to my self that I have either added or diminished any thing material to, or from the Authors which I have made use of; I desire to be believed that I have not wrote this to prove, that the Succession to the Crown ought at this day to be Elective in the same manner as it was before the Conquest, but only to obviate and remove the false Opinions or Prejudices of some Men, who by the plausible Representations of the Doctor and others, have been so far prepossessed as to believe, that an Hereditary <hi>Succession</hi> to the Crown hath been as Antient as the Monarchy it self; whereas we find that <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> have from Elective become Hereditary Kingdoms in a much less space of Time: And I suppose no Man of those Countries would asperse any Writer there, of being an Enemy to Monarchy for asserting so evident a Truth; and therefore I hope I may find the same fair Quarter at Home, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Doctor's Insinuations before his abovecited History of the <hi>Succession of the Crown, That none but Papists, Fanaticks, or Common-Wealth's Men,</hi> (a List of whose, Works he there gives us) would dare to write for, or maintain this Opinion. But if <hi>Parsons</hi> the Jesuit has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in his Discourse of the <hi>Succession,</hi> to write some Truths concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, I am no more to be thought Jesuitical for following (not him, but) the Authors from whom he took them; than I should be if I had wrote a Mathematical Dissertation founded upon Demonstrations from <hi>Euclid,</hi> which had been before made use of by <hi>Tacquet,</hi> or any other Learned Jesuit, that has wrote upon that Subject.</p>
            <p>AFTER the Election, I shall say somewhat of the Coronation of our <hi>English Saxon</hi> Kings, which sometimes was performed on the same Day on which they were Elected, and sometimes several Days, nay, Months after, as appears by the Coronation of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor</hi>; who tho he were Chosen King in <hi>June</hi> not long after his Brother <hi>Hardecnut</hi>'s Decease, yet was he not Crowned till the <hi>Easter</hi>
               <pb n="lxvi" facs="tcp:93814:36"/>
following, as you will find in the <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> under the Years 1041, 1042. But <hi>Harold</hi> his Successor (to make the Crown the surer) was Elected and Crowned the same Day. This Solemnity of the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was most commonly performed by the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> yet was it not at first done in the Church, but in the open Air; thus the Kings <hi>Athelstan, Edmund,</hi> and <hi>Edred,</hi> are expresly mentioned by our Historians to have been Crowned in the Market Place of <hi>Kingston</hi> upon <hi>Thames:</hi> and I suppose the like had been used in the Coronation of former Kings, since it is not taken notice of as an Innovation.</p>
            <p>BUT to say somewhat of the forms of those Crowns which our Kings then wore, it appears from their Coins that they were at first no other than Diadems like those of the Greek Emperors in that Age, and from whom they were borrowed: thus <hi>Offa</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians</hi> is Graven on his Coin with a Diadem of Pearls about his Head;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Ante Vitam Ael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred. R. Tab. 4. &amp; ante Camden. Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. Tab.</note> but our great King <hi>Alfred</hi> has no more than a bare Head-band, or Circle, which seems to have been tied behind, as you may see in his Coins. And tho I confess there is also a Coin of one K. <hi>Egbert</hi> with a Coronet of Rayes upon his Head; yet that this was not of our K. <hi>Egbert,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of him that was King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who began to reign <hi>An.</hi> 867, I rather incline to believe. As for King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Elder,</hi> he has in his Coins only a kind of Diadem upon his Helmet, King <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stàn, Edmund</hi> and <hi>Eadred</hi> his Brothers being the first of our <hi>West-Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Kings, who wore Crowns with three Rayes, or Points higher than the rest; and therefore I look upon it as a Fiction in them who will needs have it, that K. <hi>Alfred</hi> was Crowned with a Crown wrought with Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er de Lices; because such a Crown was kept among the <hi>Regalia</hi> at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> before our late Civil Wars, in a Box, upon whose Cover was this Inscription,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Vitam Aelfredi. pag. 158.</note> 
               <hi>Haec est Principalior Corona cum qua Coronabantur Reges, Aelfredus, Edwardus,</hi> &amp;c. Which having been the Crown of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> it was very easy for the Monks of that Church who kept those <hi>Regalia</hi> in after times, to inscribe what they pleased upon this Box, since it added so much to the Antiquity and Reputation of this Crown: and I am the more inclined to this Opinion, because I find King <hi>Cnute,</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> to be the first Kings who wore Diadems adorned with Flower-de-Lices, as appears by their Coins.</p>
            <p>I shall in the next Place say somewhat of the Titles by which our <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Kings stiled themselves in their Laws and Charters; and to begin with King <hi>Egbert,</hi> (however Supreme he were over all the rest of the Kings then reigning in <hi>England,</hi> yet we cannot find that he stiled himself more than, <hi>Rex West-Saxonum</hi> in any of his Charters; for as for Laws we have none of his left us. The like I may say for his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors <hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> and his Sons and Grandsons, as far as King <hi>Athelstan,</hi> who for ought I can find was the first Prince that upon his Victories over the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> changed his Title of <hi>Rex West-Saxonum,</hi> or <hi>Anglorum</hi> alone, which was used by his Predecessors, to this that follows, <hi>Ego</hi> Aethelstanus Rex <hi>Anglorum, per omnipotentis Dextram totius Britanniae Regno sublimatus,</hi> as you will find it in his Charter in <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, de Gestis Pontif.</hi> as also in the same Place you will find this King's Title to have somewhat varied;<note place="margin">Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I now come, in the next place, to give you an Account of the chief Powers and Prerogatives of our <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Kings; some of which I find set down in our <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> at the end of the Year 693, at the Council of <hi>Becanceld,</hi> where the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> thus defines them in his Decree at the Conclusion of that Council. <hi>Regum est,</hi> says he, <hi>constituere Comites, Duces, Vice-Comites, &amp; Judites;</hi> it is the Office of Kings to constitute Earls, Ealdormen, Sheriffs and Judges.</p>
            <p>TO which we may also add the Power of Coining Money, which being then the Prerogative of the Crown, was granted by Charter to the Arch-bishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> as likewise to the Abbots of <hi>Medeshamsted</hi> or <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and to several other Abbies; as may be seen in <hi>Monasticon Anglicanum,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Annals</hi> themselves. Some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of which I have given you in the ensuing History, not omitting some of the Coins which are still preserved in Cabinets, some of whose Figures are to be found in the Collection of <hi>Saxon</hi> Coins before King <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi>'s Life, as also before the new Edition of <hi>Camden</hi>'s <hi>Britannia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT that any of those Kings had Power by their own Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, to enhance or debase the intrinsick Value of the Money, coined either in their own or other Mints, I can no ways believe, since such a Prerogative would have highly tended to the Loss and Defrauding of the Subject, for which that Power was never designed; nor do I find our Kings ever assumed this Prerogative to themselves, till later Ages. And in Confirmation of this the <note n="†" place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> Mirror of Justices recites it as an old Law of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Times, that no King of this Realm could change, embase, or enhance his Money, or make other Coin than of Silver, <hi>san's l'assent de touts ses Counties,</hi> i. e. without the Assent of Parliament; as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> in his second Institutes, hath on very good grounds interpreted this Expression, in that Author <hi>Andrew Horne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Artic. super Chartas, <hi>cap.</hi> 20. <hi>p.</hi> 576.</note> who lived in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> I.</p>
            <p>TO these we may further add, that of pardoning Offendors their Lives in several Cases, such as striking in the King's Palace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he might also take in Case of <hi>Homicides</hi>; but still reserving the <hi>Wiregilds,</hi>
               <pb n="lxviii" facs="tcp:93814:37"/>
or Compensations that were to be made to the Friends or Relations of the Parties slain, which it was not in his Power to release, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by several Passages in our <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws, some of which I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted in this Volume; whence, I suppose, are derived the Appeals of the Wife, Son, or Brother, in Cases of Murder at this day.</p>
            <p>BUT as for the Power of making War or Peace, since I find little said of it in our Histories, I shall not be positive in asserting any thing concerning it: only shall observe, that in every Peace made by the King upon Payment of Money, the Consent of the Estates of the Kingdom was required; for Taxes could not be raised without it, as you will find in our <hi>Annals</hi> under the Years 994, 1002, 1006, 1011, when that extraordinary Tax of <hi>Danegelt</hi> was raised to be paid to the <hi>Danes</hi> for purchasing a Peace of them. And as for the Power of making Foreign War, that could also signify little, since those Kings had not the Prerogative of raising Money without the Consent of their People, any more than our Kings have at this day: nor were their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues so much in Money, as in Provisions for their Houshold.</p>
            <p>NOR can I omit here taking notice, that the <hi>English Saxon</hi> Kings wanted one great Prerogative, which ours exercise at this day, <hi>viz.</hi> the power of granting away the <hi>Demesnes</hi> of the Crown, even to pious Uses, without the Consent to the great Council of their Kingdoms: and of this we find a remarkable Instance in Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi>'s first Vol. of Councils,<note place="margin">Pag. 340.</note> where <hi>Baldred</hi> King of <hi>Kent</hi> had given the Mannor of <hi>Mallings</hi> to <hi>Christ-Church</hi> in <hi>Canterbury</hi>; but because the chief Men of his Kingdom (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Great Council) had not consented to it, it was revoked until K. <hi>Egbert</hi> afterwards by the Consent of his <hi>WITTENA GEMOT</hi> made a new Grant thereof: and this was also the reason why the Foundations and Infeodations of Abbies were always confirmed and attested by all the Estates as well Spiritual as Temporal, as you will find by most of their Charters in <hi>Monast. Anglican.</hi> of which I have inserted some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the History it self; so that I shall leave it to the Reader's Consideration, whether those Princes that could not dispose of their Crown-Lands without the Consent of the Great Council of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, could without the like Consent dispose of the Crown it self as they pleased, as Dr. <hi>Brady</hi> in his <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 7, 8.</note> History of the Succession, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> asserts, tho without any just Grounds, as hath been already proved.</p>
            <p>BUT those Kings great Prerogative chiefly consisted in giving their Sanction to all Laws that were made, as well relating to Civil as Ecclesiastical Matters, that did not concern Doctrines of Faith: but this is still to be so understood, that this Prerogative could never be exerted without the Advice and Consent of the <hi>Mycel-Gemot,</hi> or Great Council of the Realm; at which, tho they were often first drawn up into Form, and then proposed by the King, yet was their Authority also necessary for the enacting of those Laws, without which they could no ways oblige the Subject, as shall be further shewn towards the end of this Discourse.</p>
            <p>BUT since I have given you so large an Account how our Kings then obtained the Crown, it may perhaps be expected I should say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what now concerning the manner of their losing it, sometimes by other ways than Death.</p>
            <p>IN order to this I desire the Reader would observe, that not only in <hi>England,</hi> but in all the Kingdoms of <hi>Europe,</hi> that were raised upon the
<pb n="lxix" facs="tcp:93814:37"/>
Ruins of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire after the <hi>Gothic</hi> Model, the same mix'd manner of Succession, partly by Testament, partly by Election, did in those days chiefly prevail: Of which Monsieur <hi>Mezeray</hi> himself is so sensible, that in his Abridgment of the <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>At the end of the Reign of K.</hi> Clotair II. tit. Moeurs &amp; Constumes.</note> History of <hi>France,</hi> he freely owns, <q>That during the Kings of the first Race, they were still chosen out of the Royal Family; but that there were three Conditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to it. (1.) Birth, (thô whether they were legitimate or no it matter'd not). (2.) The last Will of the Father. (3.) The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Great Men, or Estates of the Kingdom; and the last of these (says he) almost ever followed the two former.</q> Moreover, that in all those Kingdoms, where this way of Election was in use, their Kings were so far from being absolute Monarchs, that they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for their Tyranny, or Male-Administration, to the Estates of the Kingdom, and were by them liable to be deposed for the same: Of which (were it to my present purpose) I could give you frequent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, not only in <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> in both which Kingdoms that Law was in force till within this last Century, when they became suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive in a Lineal Descent, by an Act of all the Estates; but also in <hi>Castile</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> and even in that of <hi>France</hi> it self (as much as she takes upon her to be Absolute at this day): and for the Proof of this I shall refer you to any <hi>French</hi> History. Those famous Examples of the last <hi>Childerick</hi>'s being Deposed by the great Council, or Assembly of the Estates of <hi>France,</hi> who elected <hi>Pepin</hi> King in his room; and also their setting aside <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> tho the undoubted Heir of the Crown by Blood, only for his supposed Enmity to the <hi>French</hi> Nation, and their choosing <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> for their King, from whom all the Kings of <hi>France</hi> from that time have been (so far as we know) lineally descended, renders this a Truth too notorious to be denied.</p>
            <p>THIS I have here mentioned, that so you may not wonder if in the ensuing History you meet with divers Examples of the <hi>English Saxons</hi> deposing their Kings; since the same Custom did in those Ages prevail in all those Kingdoms, as a part of their Original Constitution.</p>
            <p>AND for farther Proof of this, tho I could bring several Instances from the <hi>Mercians</hi> and <hi>Northumbers,</hi> yet because the latter were look'd upon as of a Rebellious Disposition against their Princes; and for the former it may be said, that those they expelled were Usurpers, and not lawful Kings; I shall therefore content my self with mentioning but two Examples concerning our <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Kings, which you will find hereafter more at large: The first is that of <hi>Sigebert,</hi> who (as the <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> inform us <hi>Anno</hi> 752.) for his <hi>unryhtum Daedum, i.e.</hi> illegal Practices, or (as <hi>Hen. Huntington</hi> paraphrases it) <hi>for his Oppression, and wresting the Laws to his own Advantage,</hi> was by all the <hi>Wites,</hi> or Wise and Great Men of <hi>West-Saxony,</hi> deprived of his Kingdom, and <hi>Cenwolf</hi> his Kinsman was by them elected in his room. <note n="†" place="margin">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> The next is that of King <hi>Edwy,</hi> who for his loose and irregular Life (tho chiefly for perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the Monks) being cast off or deposed by the <hi>Mercians</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumbers,</hi> his Brother <hi>Edgar</hi> was chosen to succeed him; but yet the Kingdom was divided, and <hi>Edwy</hi> had only <hi>West-Saxony</hi> for his share. And both this Deposition and Division were confirmed by an Act of the Estates of the whole Kingdom, as I have already shewn.</p>
            <p>BUT whether this was lawfully and rightfully done for any real Breach of their <hi>Original Contract,</hi> it is none of my Business here to decide;
<pb n="lxx" facs="tcp:93814:38"/>
it is sufficient to shew, that the Estates of those Countries then judged so; not that I maintain the Law is, or ought to be so at this day; but that it was so before the Conquest, pray consider this Law, which tho found among those that go under the Title of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> yet was certainly much more Antient, as containing not only the Office of an <hi>English</hi> King, but what he was to suffer in case he omitted that Duty: I shall give it you from the Latin Original in <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 345.</note> 
               <hi>Hoveden</hi> and <note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 138.</note> 
               <hi>Lambard,</hi> in these words, <hi>Rex qui est vicarius summi Regis, ad haec est constitutus, ut Regnum terrenum, &amp; Populum Domini, &amp; super omnia sanctam veneretur ejus Ecclesiam, &amp; regat, &amp; ab injuriosis defendat, &amp; maleficos ab ea evellat, &amp; destruat, &amp; penitùs disperdat; Quod nisi fecerit, nec</hi> Regis Nomen <hi>in eo constabit, i.e.</hi> not so much as the Name of a King shall remain to him. Here you see not only the Substance of this <hi>Original Contract,</hi> but also the Penalty annex'd to it, if it were broken.</p>
            <p>AND that there was such a thing as an <hi>Original Compact</hi> or <hi>Contract</hi> between the People of <hi>England</hi> and the Ancestors of those Kings, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which they were to govern, and upon the non-performance of which, they were liable to forfeit or lose their Crowns, I think may farther be proved, tho what the particular Heads of it were we cannot now exactly tell, unless they were those mentioned in the Oath, recited in the <hi>Mirror</hi> at the Election of the first <hi>Saxon</hi> Sovereign, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were <hi>Egbert,</hi> or any other) which indeed amounts to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract; but there was also a Compact of the like Nature in the Kingdom of the <hi>West-Saxons</hi> before King <hi>Egbert</hi>'s Time as well as after; for how else could the Great Council of the Kingdom proceed against King <hi>Sigebert</hi> or <hi>Edwy,</hi> if there had not been <hi>then</hi> some known Laws or Constitutions, upon the Violation of which they were judged unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to govern any longer? And tho the chief Heads of that Contract may have been comprized in King <hi>Ethelred</hi>'s Coronation-Oath, which I have already given you; [the first Article of which is, to preserve the Holy Church, and all Christian People in true Peace at all Times; the second, To restrain all Violence and Injustice in all sorts of People, (which comprehends any raising of Taxes by the King's Officers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law); and the third, To observe Equity and Mercy in all his Judgments, by which the King is withheld from taking away any of his Subjects Lives arbitrarily, as also from pardoning notorious Offenders against the State at his meer Pleasure; so that the Religion, Estates and Lives of his People were by this Oath well secured:] I say, tho these are the chief Heads of this Contract, yet that this was much more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient than the Ceremony of a Coronation, may appear from hence.</p>
            <p>THAT Kingly Government is this Island was never Absolute nor Despotical, but always limited by Laws; and if limited, then those Laws must have been the Bounds or Conditions of that Limitation; and if there was from the beginning, or first Institution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a constant certain great Council ordained, whose Business it was to observe, that the King did not transgress the due Bounds of his Power; that Council (so long as the Kingdom continued Elective) had likewise Authority to call him to Account for his Male-Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>BUT since the Preaching of Christianity did no ways alter the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Constitution of Government in all those seven Kingdoms above-mentioned, it follows, that there must have been an <hi>Original Contract</hi>
               <pb n="lxxi" facs="tcp:93814:38"/>
precedent to the entrance of that Religion: And it did not commence from the Coronation of our Kings, as some have imagined, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from their taking an Oath at that Time to observe the Laws of the Kingdom; because both the one and the other was much later than the Preaching of the Gospel it self: for this Ceremony of a Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> learnedly proves,<note place="margin">Seld. Tit. Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. c. 8. so. 131.</note> began no earlier in the <hi>West</hi> than with <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> his receiving his Imperial Crown from the Hands of the Pope; and this Ceremony he also shews us, was bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperors, who about <hi>Justinian,</hi> or his Successor <hi>Justin</hi>'s Time,<note place="margin">Ibid. fol. 110.</note> first introduced their Unction and Coronation by the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as he there makes out from a Passage of the Learned <hi>Onuphrius</hi> in these words,<note place="margin">De Comitiis Imperatoriis c. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Constantinopoli vel sub</hi> Justinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, <hi>vel post ejus statìm Obitum, Electioni Imperatoris additum, ut quam primùm Imperator renuntiatus esset, à Patriarchâ Constantinopolitano in magna Bizantii Basilica</hi> Oleo Unctus, <hi>Diademate Aureo redimeretur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND therefore what we find in our <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicles, or any other Historians, concerning the Coronation of our <hi>English Saxon</hi> Kings, must all of them have commenced since that Time.</p>
            <p>NOW the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi>'s Coronation above mentioned, falling out in the Year 800, it is plain that the Coronation of our Kings could not be antienter than that Time, which was near 450 Years after the Arrival of the <hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and settling Kingly Government here, and above 200 Years after the Preaching of Christianity; so that this Coronation Oath seems to have been only a constant Renovation or Confirmation of this <hi>Original Contract,</hi> at every new King's first Accession to the Throne, and must have had (if at all) its Original long before that Time.</p>
            <p>AND this also appears from the Instance of King <hi>Sigebert</hi> above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, who was deprived of his Kingdom for the Breach of this Contract, above forty Years before there was either any Emperor or King formally Crowned in these <hi>Western</hi> parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO all which we may farther add, that if our <hi>Annals</hi> and Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may be credited, it does not appear that several of our <hi>Danish</hi> Kings, tho they were solemnly Elected, were ever Crowned at all: For as for King <hi>Cnute,</hi> whose Election is mentioned in <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> and other Authors, to have been by many of the Bishops and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility at <hi>Southampton, Anno Dom.</hi> 1015. yet are they all (except Abbot <hi>Brompton</hi>'s Chronicle, which relates, that he was Crowned by <hi>Living</hi> A.Bp of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) silent as to his Coronation, only that upon their swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fealty to him, it is said he likewise swore to them, <hi>Quod secundùm Deum &amp; seculum, fidelis esset eis Dominus,</hi> i.e. that according to the Laws of God and Man, he would be a faithful Lord to them. So likewise af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Death of <hi>Edmund Ironside,</hi> the Author of <hi>Encomium Emmae,</hi> says ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, that he was Elected King by the whole <hi>English</hi> Nation; but that he was not admitted without a <hi>new Compact,</hi> both <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Roger Hovenden</hi> inform us in these words, <hi>viz.</hi> That when they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain accepted of him for their King, and had sworn Fealty to him; he likewise again pledged his Faith to them in this Form, <hi>Accepto pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nore de manu, sua nuda, cum juramentis à Principibus Danorum,</hi> i. e. they received a Pledg or Promise from his bare or naked Hand, together with the Oaths given by the chief Men of the <hi>Danes</hi>; who it seems swore on the King's behalf, that he would observe the Conditions he had made before with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="lxxii" facs="tcp:93814:39"/>BUT as for the Coronation of his Son <hi>Harold Harefoot,</hi> that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly denied by the said Author of <hi>Encomium Emmae</hi>; for he says that <hi>Elnoth</hi> (or <hi>Agelnoth</hi>) Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> flatly refused to crown him, because he said he had taken an Oath not to anoint him King so long as the Children of Queen <hi>Emma</hi> were alive; and that laying down the Crown and Scepter upon the High Altar, he straitly forbad all the Bishops to crown <hi>Harold,</hi> which so incensed him, that he thenceforth despised his Episcopal Benediction.</p>
            <p>BUT whether this Author (who yet lived in that very Time) might not write this out of Hatred to <hi>Harold</hi>'s Memory, as well as out of Love to Queen <hi>Emma</hi> and her Children, I will not take upon me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, since no Historian besides himself makes any mention of it; for the antient History of <hi>Ramsey</hi> Abby, written some time after the Conquest, and now lately publish'd by Dr. <hi>Gale,</hi> says expresly in the Title to Chapt. 94. That <hi>Harold</hi> was Consecrated (<hi>i.e.</hi> Anointed) King.</p>
            <p>BUT that the <hi>English</hi> Nation before the Conquest, believed that their Kings were obliged to govern them by Law, (<hi>i.e.</hi> according to the <hi>original Compact</hi>) and that their <hi>Allegiance</hi> to them was then looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as wholly due on that Account, our <hi>Annals</hi> seem to justify, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1014, when the <hi>English Wites,</hi> or <hi>Wise Men,</hi> both of the Clergy and Laity, after the Death of <hi>Sweyn</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> sent over a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to King <hi>Ethelred,</hi> being then retired into <hi>Normandy,</hi> whereby they assured him. <q>That no Prince was dearer to them than their own natural Lord; always provided, <hi>Gif He hi rihtlicor healdan wolde thonne He aer dyde,</hi> (as it is in the <hi>Saxon) i.e.</hi> if he would govern them more rightly (<hi>i.e.</hi> according to Law) for the future than he had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: whereupon he promised to be a faithful Lord to them, (<hi>i.e.</hi> a Prince keeping his Oath and Promise) and redress all their Grievances, if on their parts they would return to their Allegiance. And thus by giving mutual Assurances, he came Home and contracted a new Friendship or League with his People.</q>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING now got over these great Points of the manner of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, and Deprivation of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings; I shall next as briefly as I can run through all those Orders and Degrees of Men that did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute this Common-Weal.</p>
            <p>THE first Degree of Men beneath that of Kings, was that of <hi>Aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>

                  <hi>Aetheling.</hi>
               </note> or Prince of the Blood Royal, being derived from the <hi>Saxon</hi> word <hi>Aethel,</hi> which signifies Noble, and <hi>Ing,</hi> which being added to it, signifies one derived from Royal Blood, as appears by the Terminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Names in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Genealogies, set down in our <hi>Annals</hi> under <hi>Anno</hi> 449. and in several other Places, and was common not only to the King's Eldest Son, but to all others nearly related to the Blood Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and was a meer honorary Title, without any Power or Jurisdiction annexed to it that I know of, unless the King was at any time pleased to bestow it. Nor can I here omit giving you the Names of two other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Offices or Dignities of the Kingdom, the one of which was Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, the other Civil, the former in <hi>Saxon</hi> was called <hi>CYNINGS HOLD,</hi> in Latin <hi>Princeps Militiae,</hi>

Civitatis, vel Burgi,</hi> whence the Title of our present Aldermen of Cities and great Towns are derived, (tho of a far different Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as a much later Institution:) and this I suppose happened by reason of the Paucity of words in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue, which called Grave Men, distinguished by any Office or Dignity, by the Title of <hi>Ealdormen,</hi> because they were at first bestowed on Men of elder Years; tho afterwards,<note place="margin">Cap. 35. tit. Geref.</note> as the <hi>Auctuary</hi> to King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws informs us, they were not so stiled <hi>propter senectutem, cum quidam Adolescentes essent; sed propter sapientiam.</hi> Therefore I cannot forbear taking notice, that whereas <hi>Bede</hi> speaking of K. <hi>Oswald</hi>'s sending (<hi>ad Majores natu Scotorum</hi>) to the Elders of the <hi>Scots</hi> for Bishops,<note place="margin">Hist. Eccles. Lib. 3. Cap 3. &amp; Vid. Lib. 1. Cap. 13.</note> King <hi>Alfred</hi> in his Translation of <hi>Bede,</hi> calls them, the <hi>Ealdormen</hi> of the <hi>Scots,</hi> that is, the Great or Chief Men of that Nation. I must here beg the Reader's Pardon, for a Mistake I have committed in the rendring of that Passage into <hi>English</hi> in the ensuing History; for not having the <hi>Saxon</hi> Version by me, but only a <hi>Latin</hi> Copy, when I wrote it, nor having then consulted Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> to whom I confess my self much beholden for this Criticism; I have there translated the words <hi>Majores Natu, Scotish</hi> Bishops, because I thought it most proper for them to be sent to about an Affair concerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>I have no more to say on this Head, only that I have left this word <hi>Ealdorman,</hi> so often used in our <hi>Annals,</hi> untranslated: for tho I grant he is frequently stiled <hi>Dux,</hi> or <hi>Comes,</hi> in Latin, yet it would not bear being rendred Duke or Earl in <hi>English,</hi> because that those Titles are not only very different, but were unknown in our <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue, till many Years after that Government was setled in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to the Title <hi>Earl,</hi> or <hi>Eorle,</hi> which being altogether <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eorle.</hi>
               </note> was not commonly used here till the Reign of King <hi>Cnute,</hi> tho we now and then find it mentioned in our <hi>Annals</hi> before his Time; but as for its Power and Authority, it being much what the same with that of <hi>Ealdorman</hi> abovementioned, I think I need say no more of it, only that neither of them were then Hereditary, nor descended to Sons or Brothers, tho they often continued in the same Family, when the King was pleased so to confer it: And both the Title and the Office were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be forfeited upon any great Male-Administration, as you will find in divers Instances in this Book.</p>
            <p>THE next Title and Office I shall mention, is, that of <hi>Heretoch,</hi> which was wholly Military;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heretoch.</hi>
               </note> and, as Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> in his <hi>Glossary</hi> supposes,<note place="margin">Tit. Holde.</note> was the same with that of the <hi>Holde,</hi> or Commander in War, mentioned in the Laws of King <hi>Athelstan</hi>; because his <hi>Wiregild</hi> is made equal to that of a <hi>High-Gerife, viz.</hi> four thousand <hi>Thrym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS <hi>Heretoch</hi> seems to have been somewhat like our Lord-Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of a County at this Day; and was chosen for some extraordinary Occasion, as upon a sudden Invasion or Expedition against the <hi>Scots</hi> or <hi>Welshmen</hi>: Which being over, their Commission also ceased, but they themselves were still had in high Esteem and Honour, if they had pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and couragiously discharged that great Trust. And as the same Author observes, in some Antient Charters, (I suppose whilst the <hi>Ealdorman</hi> exercised the whole Power of the County, as well Civil as Military) the same Title of <hi>Ealdorman</hi> signified the latter Dignity; of which he gives us this Instance, from a Charter out of the Antient Book

            </p>
            <p>BUT in the Time of <hi>Edward the Confessor</hi> (and I suppose also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) they were certainly distinguished,<note place="margin">Tit. de Her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tochiis.</note> as appears by the Thirty fifth Auctuary of that King's Laws; where after the Offices of the <hi>Ealdor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and <hi>Greve,</hi> the Duty of <hi>Heretochs</hi> is thus described, which I will give you here in English. <q>And there were other Powers and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities constituted through all the Provinces and Counties of the whole Kingdom, which were by the English called <hi>Heretochs,</hi> to wit, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Wise, Faithful, and Stout Barons. These sate our Armies in Battel Array, and raised others as they thought fit for the Honour of the Crown, and Service of the Kingdom. They were elected by the Common-Council for the publick Benefit of the Realm in all Provinces and Counties at a full <hi>Folk-mote,</hi> as the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> of the same also were, and ought to be: And in every County there was always one <hi>Heretoch</hi> thus elected, to conduct the <hi>Militia</hi> of his County, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the King's Orders, for the Honour and Profit of the Crown of the said Kingdom, whenever there was Occasion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>FROM whence we may observe, That before, as well as sometime after the Conquest, when this Auctuary was made, the King had not the Nomination either of the <hi>Heretoch</hi> or <hi>Sheriff,</hi> which were then the two Great Officers of the County, the one Military, the other Civil.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus dispatched the Military, I proceed to the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Sheriff</hi>; in Saxon, <hi>Scire-Gerefa,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sheriff.</hi>
               </note> (or more contractedly <hi>Greve</hi> in the Laws of King <hi>Edward</hi>) who is called by <hi>Ethelwerd, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actor Regius, (i.e.</hi> the King's Receiver). This Officer,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. An. 787.</note> as <hi>Asser</hi> shews us in his Life of <hi>Alfred,</hi> before that King made his new Reformation of the Kingdom, was appointed by the <hi>Ealdorman,</hi> and therefore called <hi>Vice-Dominus,</hi> and was much what the same with our <hi>Vice-Comes,</hi> or <hi>Sheriff,</hi> at this Day: But whether he had the Title of Sheriff before, as well as after that Alteration by King <hi>Alfred,</hi> I will not determine.</p>
            <p>BUT it appears by both these Latin Titles, that he was the Officer, who instead of the <hi>Ealdorman,</hi> or Earl, sat as Judge in those we now call the County-Court, and Sheriff's Tourn. But these being so well known at this Day, I shall not further enlarge, only that this Officer was also to answer to the King's <hi>Exchequer</hi> for all Fines, Amerciaments, and other Duties arising out of the County; the third Penny of which the Earl had granted him by the King, <hi>pro sustentatione Dignitatis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now I come at last to that great extensive Dignity of a <hi>Thane,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Thane.</hi>
               </note> called in Saxon <hi>Thegne,</hi> being derived from the old word <hi>Theowian,</hi> to serve; because they that had this Honour conferred on them, were at first the King's Officers or Servants, and in our Antient Latin Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, subscribed by the Name of <hi>Ministri Regis,</hi> and are called in the Version of our <hi>Saxon Annals,</hi> as also in <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester, Ministri Regii</hi>; not that they were really always the King's Domestick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, tho they were so originally; on whom he likewise bestowed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Lands in lieu of those Services, (Wages in Money being not then in use) which Lands descended to their Heirs, if the King pleased.</p>
            <p>THIS Title of <hi>Thane</hi> was of two sorts, the one Spiritual, the other Temporal; the former were called in <hi>Saxon, Messe-Thegnes,</hi> i.e. <hi>Mass-Thanes,</hi> Priests, or Parsons of Churches, and other dignified
<pb n="lxxvi" facs="tcp:93814:41"/>
Clergy-Men; of whom I shall now say nothing, but that they were then of so great Note, that in our <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws they are ranged before the <hi>Werold-Thegnes,</hi> i. e. Temporal <hi>Thanes,</hi> and their <hi>Weregilds</hi> rated at the same Value with them, <hi>viz.</hi> two thousand <hi>Thrymsa</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>
               <q>AND tho the word denoted a Servant or Minister in general, (and so divers had the Title as it were meerly Officiary and Personal) yet as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> informs us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit. of Honours,</hi> Fol. 507, 508.</note> those that were the King's immediate Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of fair Possessions, which they held by personal Service, as of his Person, (or as we say by <hi>Grand-Serjeanty,</hi> or Knight's Service in chief) were, I conceive, the <hi>Thanes</hi> that had the Honorary Dignity, and were part of the greater Nobility of that Time; howsoever those Officiary Dignities of <hi>Holde</hi> and <hi>Highgereue,</hi> had then precedence of them: that is, they were all the King's Feudal <hi>Thanes,</hi> and the Land held so was called <hi>Tainland</hi> or <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Notas ad Eadmerum <hi>pag.</hi> 170.</note> 
                  <hi>Thaneland,</hi> as afterwards the Lands held that made a Baron were called a <hi>Barony,</hi> as also they are called to this day. This Title continued all the <hi>Saxon</hi> times until the coming in of the <hi>Normans,</hi> and it was in some use also after that Time, and then was succeeded by that of <hi>Barons.</hi>
               </q> This Title being of <hi>Norman</hi> Extraction, we rarely meet with it before the Conquest.</p>
            <p>THERE were also besides these Chief <hi>Thanes,</hi> others who were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led middle or under <hi>Thanes,</hi> being the same with the less sort of <hi>Barons,</hi> or Lords of Mannors, who holding of other great Lords, and not of the King, were those that after the Conquest were called <hi>Vavasors</hi>; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to whom there were likewise a third Sort, who seemed to have been made up of the least or meanest Degree of Gentry or Freeholders, which were then all one; none but the Gentry or less Nobility then enjoying Lands by Freehold Tenure. And in this sense is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that Law of King <hi>Cnute,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 52.</note> whereby it is appointed, <q>That if the Master of a Family (who by that Law was to have all his Houshold under his Pledg) were accused of suffering any of them by his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity to escape, being guilty of any Crime, he was then to wage Law with five other <hi>Thanes, (i. e.</hi> in Latin <hi>Nobilibus</hi>) himself making the sixth.</q> Now it was impossible that there should be so many Chief <hi>Thanes,</hi> who held immediately of the King in any one Hundred or Tything, out of which those <hi>Thanes,</hi> or Gentlemen that were to make this Purgation, were to be taken.</p>
            <p>BUT of all these <hi>Thanes,</hi> or less Nobility, I shall speak more at large by and by, when I come to consider the Members that composed the <hi>Mycel-Gemot,</hi> or Common-Council of the Kingdom, of which these made up the great and principal Part.</p>
            <p>AND next to them I find another Title, tho not commonly used, yet as antient as the Laws of King <hi>Ina,</hi> as also mentioned in several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King's Laws,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sithcund-Man.</hi>

               <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Sithcund Man,</hi> who if he refused his Service in the Army, or a Military Expedition, he forfeited his Land.</p>
            <p>THIS Name Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> in his <hi>Glossary</hi> derives from <hi>Sith,</hi> or <hi>Giseth, Comes, vel Socius,</hi> a Ruler or Governour; and <hi>Cund, Kind,</hi> as it signifies the Condition and Quality of any one; and <hi>Mon, Man,</hi> that is, a sort of <hi>Comes, Governour, Judg,</hi> or <hi>Praefect:</hi> he was esteemed equal to a <hi>Thane,</hi> by the valuation of his Life in <hi>Aethelstan</hi>'s Laws.</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>Comes</hi> is not to be taken in that Sense, as if he was a Count or Lord, (as now understood) being only a <hi>Comes,</hi> or Companion in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of those of his own Rank or Degree, and interpreted by Mr.

            <p>SINCE I have been so large in this <hi>Introduction,</hi> I have chosen but slightly to mention these Dignities and Offices; for they having been so learnedly and fully handled by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his <hi>Titles of Honour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 5.</note> as also by Dr. <hi>Brady</hi> in his first Part of the <hi>Saxon History,</hi> and by Dr. <hi>Howel</hi> in his Discourse of the Polity of the <hi>English Saxons,</hi>

            <p>THE first is that of <hi>Ceorle,</hi> or Countrey-man,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ceorle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </note> (from whence our word <hi>Carle</hi> or <hi>Churle</hi> is derived); indeed he could not be possessed of what was called <hi>Bockland,</hi> or Free-land conveyable by Deed; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was as free as to his Person and Property as the greatest <hi>Thane</hi> of them all. And therefore we find in the Laws of King <hi>Alfred,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers pecuniary Penalties enacted against those who should commit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery with a Country-man's Wife, or should endeavour to vitiate the Chastity of his Servant or Slave; or should break the Peace by fighting, either in his House or Yard. And as for his Person, by the last of those Laws it is appointed, what Satisfaction in Money shall be paid by any who wound or maim him, even to Nail of his little Finger. And this Law as equally extended to him, as to those of the greatest Quality. And because the Nobility or Gentry were too apt to abuse these poor Countrymen who were their Tenants and Vassals, the thirty first Law of King <hi>Alfred</hi> ordains, what Satisfaction a Man was to make for any ways injuring and misusing a <hi>Ceorle</hi>'s Man, by binding him, beating him, or cutting off his Hair; Frolicks, I suppose, too often then in fashion among some ill-natured domineering Gentlemen; which made this merciful and good King provide such a necessary Law for their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Security.</p>

               <q>Which is also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Mr. <hi>Lambard,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apud Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard in Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rar, Cantii, pag. 552, 553.</note> in his <hi>Itinerary</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> concerning the same Law, and is there set down in <hi>Saxon,</hi> which I shall here translate thus; That if a <hi>Ceorl</hi> or a Country-man so thrived, that he had fully five Hides of his own Land, a Church, a Kitchin, a Bell-house, a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough-gate with a Seat, and any distinct Office in the King's Court, then was he thenceforth of equal Honour or Dignity with a <hi>Thane.</hi>
               </q> Where by the Church, the Kitchin, the Bell-house, the Borough-gate, with a Seat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> understands, <q>The State or Fashion of a Lord of that Time, in having a Church for his Family and Tenants, in keeping a Court for them, (which may well be meant in the <hi>Burh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate setl,</hi> or <hi>Town-gate with a Seat)</hi> and in keeping a House or Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment competent to that Dignity, which may be understood in the <hi>Cycenan</hi> and <hi>Belhuis,</hi> i.e. <hi>Kitchin</hi> and <hi>Bell-house.</hi> The Bell-house may denote the Hall, which was the place of ordinary Diet and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment in the Houses of Lords. It may well so signify, if the <hi>Saxons</hi> used the like Reason in imposing the Name on the Lord's Hall, as some say the <hi>Italian, Spanish,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> have done, in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it <hi>Tinello, Tinello,</hi> and <hi>Tinel</hi>; which in our Laws also is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="lxxix" facs="tcp:93814:42"/>
in <hi>Tinel le Roy,</hi> for the King's Hall. They would have it therefore so named, because the <hi>Tin,</hi> or tinkling of a Bell at the Times of Dinner and Supper were signified by it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT <hi>Sundernota,</hi> mentioned in the Latin Copy of this Law, seems to denote the distinct Office which he was to hold in the King's Court to make him equal to a <hi>Thane.</hi> And it is also observable, that by the same Laws of King <hi>Athelstane</hi> abovementioned, such a <hi>Ceorlsman</hi> so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and having five Hides of Land, <hi>(ad Vtwarum Regis)</hi> that is, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in the same place interprets, held by Knights Service, <hi>Si oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidatur, reddentur</hi> 2 <hi>Millia Thrymsarum</hi>; so that his <hi>Wiregyld</hi> shews him to have been every way equal to a <hi>Thane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the most considerable Observation that may be made from this Law, is, that V. Hides of Land were at that time reckoned a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Estate to constitute a <hi>Thane.</hi> But as to the Quantity of Land that then went to make a Hide, it was sometimes more and sometimes less, according to the Goodness or Quality of the Soil; but was certainly no more than what one Plow could well manure, together with Pasture, Meadow, and Wood, competent for the Maintenance of that Plow, and the Servants of the Family. So that the Estate of such a <hi>Thane</hi> could not be much more than what an ordinary Gentleman has at this day.</p>
            <p>NOR can I here pretermit what follows in the same Law above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, where after having shewn us by what means an Under <hi>Theyn</hi> might come to be a Chief <hi>Thane,</hi> and from thence attain to the Dignity of an <hi>Earl,</hi> it thus proceeds. <q>And if a Merchant so thrived, that he had passed thrice over the wide (or broad) Sea, by his own Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, (or Craft as it is in the <hi>Saxon)</hi> he was thenceforth a <hi>Thane</hi>'s Right-worthy, <hi>i. e.</hi> was every way equal to him.</q> Where you may observe that Wealth and Industry conferred Nobility in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Times as well as at this Day.</p>
            <p>I come now to the lowest Rank of Men, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Slaves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Slaves.</hi>
               </note> who were called in Latin <hi>Servi,</hi> and in Saxon <hi>Freortorlings</hi>; and there were two sorts of them, <hi>viz.</hi> such as were <hi>Personal,</hi> possessing no Estates,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Aelfric. Gloss. Saxonic</note> but all that they earn'd was their Lords, by whom therefore they were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. The others were <hi>Praedial,</hi> such as were of Servile Condition and Original, but possessed their small Holdings and Goods at the Will of their Lord, doing all those Servile Countrey Works that were set them; and from thence in the more modern <hi>Norman</hi> Dialect were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Villains,</hi> from those Villages where they lived and wrought: But before as well as after the Conquest, that the Latin word <hi>Villanus</hi> did not signify a Villain or Servant, I could prove from many Instances, both out of Records and Histories, if I thought it would not be too tedious in this Place.</p>
            <p>AS for the Original of these Slaves among the <hi>Saxons,</hi> there is some doubt about them; some supposing them to have been derived from the remainder of those meaner sort of <hi>Britains,</hi> who were either taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, or else never forsook the Land, and so their Lives being saved, they were made servile by their Conquerors; or else such as were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from those who came over in the nature of Slaves to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Saxons</hi> that first landed here: but it is not much material how they began, since they might proceed from both, or either of these Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals;
<pb n="lxxx" facs="tcp:93814:43"/>
nor had their Lords Power of Life or Death over them, for if they killed any of them, they were to pay the Value of their Heads to the King.</p>
            <p>THESE Slaves, if they were set free at any time by their Masters, were what the <hi>Romans</hi> called <hi>Liberti,</hi> and in Saxon <hi>Freolaetan</hi>; but being then resolved into the Body of <hi>Ceorles,</hi> or Countrey-men, they did not, as among the <hi>Romans,</hi> constitute any new Order of Men.</p>
            <p>HAVING now gone through all the Sorts and Degrees of Men, who either lived in, or were maintained out of the Countrey; I shall in the next Place say somewhat of another distinct Body of Men, called in Saxon <hi>Burh-witan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Burh witan,</hi> i. e. <hi>Citizens and Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
               </note> or <hi>Burh-wara,</hi> that is, Citizens or Townsmen, who had Privileges peculiar to themselves, and living in Cities or great Towns, were governed by their own particular Magistrates called <hi>Eal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dormen,</hi> or <hi>Portgerefan,</hi> i. e. <hi>Port-Reeves,</hi> assisted by the Chief Men of the Place,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Aelfric, Gloss. Saxonic</note> called in Saxon, <hi>Yldist-Burh-wara,</hi> who were much the same with what we now call <hi>Aldermen</hi> or <hi>Common-Council</hi> Men; for as for the Title of <hi>Mayor,</hi> it came not in use here till long after the Conquest.</p>
            <p>BUT as for these Magistrates and Members of Cities and Towns, I shall speak more by and by, when I come to treat of the constituent Parts of the Great Council of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>FROM the different Orders of Men, we shall now descend to speak of the different Courts where these Persons abovementioned,<note place="margin">

               </note> (all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Villains) were bound to appear, and there either to do or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Justice; for which it will be necessary to look back to the Reign of King <hi>Alfred,</hi> who after the first Invasion of the <hi>Danes,</hi> when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to resettle the Kingdom, found his Subjects so far corrupted by a long and hazardous War, that all Places being full of Robberies and Murders, there was an absolute necessity for the making of more severe Laws to restrain them; so that (omitting the Division of Counties or Shires, which I shall speak to hereafter) he Canton'd his Kingdom, 1<hi>st.</hi> into <hi>Trihings</hi> or <hi>Lathes,</hi>

               <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> adds to this, <q>That he that could not find Security, was afraid of the Severity of the Laws; and if any guilty Person, either before his giving Security or after, should make his Escape, all of that Hundred and Tything should incur the King's Fine.</q>
            </p>
            <p>HERE we have the Original of <hi>Decennaries,</hi> or <hi>Fribourgs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vid.

All which ten Persons being thus bound one for another, were united under one Head, called a <hi>Tythingman,</hi> and in some places a <hi>Bors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder</hi>; for <hi>BORGH</hi> signifies a <hi>Surety</hi> or <hi>Pledg,</hi> and <hi>FRI</hi> is all one as <hi>Free.</hi> From whence comes our word <hi>NEIGHBOVRS,</hi> that is, those that are <hi>Near-Pledges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT that this Law concerning the <hi>Decennaries</hi> or Tythings, was not only made for the meer Vulgar or ordinary sort of People, but that the Chiefest of the Nobility, and even the Arch-Bishops and Bishops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were alike subject to it,<note place="margin">Vid. Lambard. LL. Edward, Cap. 16.</note> will appear by that Law of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> confirmed by King <hi>William</hi> I. whereby all Arch-Bishops Bishops, Earls and Barons, and all those that had Courts of <hi>Sac. Soc.</hi> and <hi>Theam, &amp;c.</hi> swore to keep their Knights, and all other Servants there mentioned in their <hi>Frithborg, (i. e. Franc-pledg)</hi> for whom these Lords or Masters themselves were to be Sureties: so that if any of them offended, their Lords were obliged to do right in their Courts. And by the Laws of <hi>Cnute,</hi> every Thane or Gentleman of Estate,<note place="margin">Cap. 50.</note> was to have his Family under his own Pledg; and if any of them were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, he was to answer for him in the Hundred Court, <hi>i. e.</hi> was to compel him to appear. And the Lord was also to be answerable for him, if he escaped; so that all the Privilege that Noblemen and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen had above the common Men, was, that they were not bound one for another, so as to be part of any Decennary or Tithing; but each of them was Head of his own <hi>Friburgh,</hi> and his Family was as it were a distinct <hi>Tithing</hi> of it self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="lxxxii" facs="tcp:93814:44"/>I observe this, to let the Reader understand, that how severe soever this Law was, it was no Badg of Slavery or Subjection upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, for even the best Men in the Kingdom were alike subject to it: Neither was it brought in, or increased, in Rigour by the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest, as some, with greater Prejudice than Truth, have maintained; since the <hi>Normans</hi> as well as the <hi>English,</hi> were all under one and the same Law as to this Point.</p>
            <p>THE Laws of this Court of the <hi>Tithing,</hi> were these;</p>
            <p>FIRST, That if any one offended, and failed to appear, the other Sureties were bound to have him forth-coming to Justice.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, But if the guilty Party fled, he should not be any where received without a Testimonial from the <hi>Tithing</hi> from whence he came: So that a Man being out of any <hi>Tithing,</hi> if he were received in any Town, the whole Town was in the King's Mercy. But by the Laws of King <hi>Edward,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 20.</note> the <hi>Decennary</hi> was allowed one and thirty Days to bring the Offender to Justice, that so he might make Satisfaction, either by his Goods or Body.</p>
            <p>THE third was, that if he could not be found, then the <hi>Tithingman</hi> or <hi>Borsholder,</hi> taking with him two of the best of his own <hi>FRIBVRGH,</hi> and of the three neighbouring <hi>FRIBVRGHS</hi> nine, (to wit, of each the chief <hi>Tithingman,</hi> and two others of the best Note) and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King's Justice (if he could) he was to purge himself by Oath of the Offence and Flight of the Criminal: But if he could not, he with his own <hi>FRIBVRGH</hi> was to restore the Loss out of the Goods of the Party, if they were sufficient, or otherwise out of his own, and those of his <hi>FRIBVRGH.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LASTLY, If the Neighbouring <hi>FRIBOVRGS</hi> would not be their Compurgators, then they were to swear for themselves, that they were therein no ways Guilty; and that so soon as ever they could find him, they would bring the Offender to Justice, or else discover where he was.</p>
            <p>THERE were many other particulars concerning this Matter which I pass over, that I may not be thought too prolix; but these are the most material.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I shall say no more of this Court, but refer the Reader to the said Book (from whence I have taken most of those things I have here given you concerning all these Courts);<note place="margin">Vid. Dugdale Origin. Jurid.</note> wherein he may find at large how great the Power of this Court was, not only before but after the Conquest: And I have also reserved the treating of these two Courts by themselves, because tho the 3 former are supposed by some to be of K. <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Erection upon his new Reformation of the Kingdom, but these two were not so; for notwithstanding <hi>Ingulf</hi> tells us, that this King <hi>Alfred</hi> first divided the Provinces of <hi>England</hi> into Counties, yet we find Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> Learnedly makes it out,<note place="margin">Selden<hi>'s Tit. of Honours,</hi> chap. 5.

               <q>That <hi>Alfred</hi> was not the first that divided the Kingdom into <hi>Shires</hi> or <hi>Counties</hi>; for (saith he) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Time, those Provinces had their <hi>Ealdormen</hi> in them: Thus we read of <hi>Ethelwolfus Barocensis Pagae Comes,</hi> and <hi>Ceorle Dom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naniae Comes,</hi> and <hi>Eanulf Somersetensis Pagae Comes</hi>; for the Earldoms of <hi>Barkshire, Devonshire</hi> and <hi>Somersetshire</hi> under King <hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to King <hi>Alfred,</hi> are remembred in <hi>Asserius Menevensis,</hi> that lived in King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Time.

            </p>
            <p>TO which I may also add divers Examples that you will meet with of the same kind in the following History, out of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus dispatched these inferior Courts, I come now to the chiefest, (next to that of the Great Council of the Kingdom) <hi>viz.</hi> that which was called <hi>Curia Domini Regis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Curia Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini Regis.</hi>
               </note> 
               <q>Because oftentimes (as Sir <hi>Wil. Dugdale</hi> informs us) the King himself sate here in Person, having several Justices, <hi>à latere suo residentes,</hi> as <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 3. C. 10.</note>

            </p>
            <p>CONCERNING this Court, tho we have not many Memorials left of it before the Conquest, yet it was certainly at that Time in Being, since it seems to have been then the Great Court of all Appeals, as well Criminal as Civil, long after the Conquest, before the Court of <hi>Common-Pleas</hi> was taken out of it: for here it was that K. <hi>Alfred</hi> is supposed to have re-heard and examined the false Judgments of his inferior Judges in the <hi>Hundred,</hi> and <hi>County-Courts</hi>; and here it was also that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned above <hi>forty</hi> of them to be executed in one Year, for their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Sentences in Matters of Life and Death,<note place="margin">Cap. 5.</note> as you will find in the <hi>Mirror of Justices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need say no more of this Great Court, whose Power now resides in that of the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> and <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> neither the <hi>Chancery</hi> nor <hi>Exchequer</hi> having then any Being; the former of which commenc'd long after the Conquest, and the latter was erected by King <hi>William</hi> the <hi>First.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have but two Observations to make concerning our Antient <hi>English Saxon</hi> Courts of Justice; the <hi>FIRST</hi> of which is, that strict Union there then was as well in the <hi>Folk-mote</hi> and <hi>County-Court,</hi> as in the <hi>Hundred-Court,</hi> between the Ecclesiastical and Civil State; in both which the Bishop and the Sheriff sitting together, all Causes both Spiritual and Secular were equally, and at one time, dispatched to the great Ease and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Subject, who were taught by the Bishop in the <hi>Folk-mote</hi> what was their Duty towards God and the Church, as they were by the Ealdorman or Sheriff what Common Laws they were bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, in order to their Honest and Peaceable Living one among ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: a Custom, which when reading of Books was not generally in use among the Laiety, was absolutely necessary for the acquainting them with their Duty; in imitation of which I suppose our Common Charges at <hi>Assizes</hi> and <hi>Sessions</hi> are continued to this Day.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>SECOND</hi> is, the great Ease the Subject must needs find in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Justice administred to him in smaller Actions, in the Court of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary</hi> or <hi>Tything,</hi> even at their own Doors; or else in Appeals and greater Actions at the Court of the <hi>Trihing</hi> or <hi>Lathe</hi>; from whence they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it to the <hi>County-Court</hi>; and if they thought themselves aggrieved there, then they might bring it before the King himself, or his chief Justiciary, in the Great Court abovementioned. An Admirable and an Excellent Constitution this! whilst the Laws of <hi>England</hi> were few, easy and plain, before the Partiality and Corruption of Countrey Juries came in, and the bandying and Factions of Rich and Powerful Men in
<pb n="lxxxvi" facs="tcp:93814:46"/>
the Countrey against each other, together with the vast varieties of Determinations of Cases in Law, had rendered those inferior Courts not only perplexed, but unsafe and vexatious to the Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Great Council, or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </note>I come now to the Supream Court of the whole Kingdom, called in <hi>Saxon</hi> the <hi>Wittena-Gemot,</hi> or <hi>Mycel-Synoth</hi>; in Latin <hi>Magnum,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune Concilium Regni,</hi> the Great or Common-Council of the Kingdom, consisting of the King and the three Estates, which we now call our <hi>Parliament</hi>; which Court the Author of the <hi>Mirror of Justices</hi> expresly tells us, <q>That King <hi>Alfred</hi> ordained for a perpetual Custom, that twice in the Year, or oftner, in Time of Peace, if Business so required, they should assemble at <hi>London</hi> to treat of the good Government of God's People, and how Folks should be restrained from Offending, and live in Quiet, and should receive <hi>Right</hi> by certain Antient Usages and Judgments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> From whence you may observe, that in this Author's Time, (<hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Edward</hi> I.) it was held for Law, <q>That the great Council of the Kingdom antiently met of Course twice in the Year, without any express Summons from the King; and this it seems was afterwards altered to thrice in the Year, <hi>viz.</hi> at the three great Feasts of <hi>Christmass, Easter,</hi> and <hi>Whitsontide,</hi> when the King met his Estates with great Solemnity, wearing his Crown upon all solemn Days of Entertainment; and when the Feasting was over, they fell to dispatch the publick Affairs,<note place="margin">

            <p>THESE stated Councils which were then held <hi>ex More</hi> (as our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians term it) <hi>i. e.</hi> according to antient Custom, continued long after the Conquest, as shall be farther shewn hereafter: but if this Council happened to meet at any other extraordinary Time, then the King's special Summons was requisite, as you may find in <hi>Ingulf</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 948. where he tells us, King <hi>Edred</hi> summoned the Arch-bishops, Bishops, and all the <hi>Proceres,</hi> and <hi>Optimates (i. e.</hi> Chief Men of the Kingdom) to meet him at <hi>London</hi> at the Purification of the <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi> Whence we may observe, that this Summons was thus issued, because this Council was extraordinary, as not being held <hi>ex more,</hi> at any of the usual great Feasts abovementioned.</p>
            <p>CONCERNING the Original of this great Assembly, since Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi> in all his Works,<note place="margin">Pag. 116, 117, 118.</note> and particularly in his <hi>Patriarcha</hi>; and Dr. <hi>Johnston</hi> in his <hi>Excellency of Monarchical Government,</hi> 
               <q>Would have this (as well as all our other Liberties and Privileges) to have been only Royal Abatements of Power,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Introduct. and Fol. 127, 128.</note> and gracious Indulgences and Condescensions of our Kings for the Benefit and Security of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; who were pleased to condescend to call some Persons of each of the three Estates (it being left to their Discretion whom to summon, and whom not); and tho many of our Kings have made use of such great Assemblies to consult about important Affairs of State, and by their Consent and Approbation, to make Laws as well as (at their Prayers and Petitions) to redress their just Grievances, yet they owed their being to our first Monarchs, since till about the time of the Conquest there could be no General Assembly of the Estates of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, because till those Times we cannot learn it was entirely united into one; but it was either divided into several Kingdoms, or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by several Laws.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I confess this looks at first like a specious Hypothesis, and may serve perhaps to prevail upon some ignorant and unwary Readers, who will not,
<pb n="lxxxvii" facs="tcp:93814:46"/>
or cannot give themselves the trouble of searching to the Bottom, to find out the Truth of things. But I desire the Favour of those who believe and maintain this Opinion, to answer me these few Queries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FIRST,</hi> How it came to pass that in all the Kingdoms of <hi>Europe,</hi> erected out of the Ruines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, (as well as those that were not, but yet had been constituted according to the same <hi>Gothick</hi> Model) the like General or Great Council of Estates, consisting of the same Degrees and Orders of Men, were to be found in every one of those Kingdoms? To begin with <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and then go on to the Kingdom of <hi>Germany,</hi> now called the <hi>Empire,</hi> and so into <hi>France,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Spain,</hi> among all the petty Kingdoms that then composed that Monarchy (taking <hi>Portugal,</hi> if you please, into the Account); you will find that the Estates of all those Kingdoms (as representing the whole Body of the same) consisted of the Clergy, Nobility, and Deputies of Cities and great Towns; which is briefly comprized by this single Verse of <hi>Gonterus,</hi> an old <hi>German</hi> Poet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Estate of the Empire in his Time,</p>
            <q>Praelati, Proceres, missis<expan>
                  <am>
                     <g ref="char:abque"/>
                  </am>
                  <ex>que</ex>
               </expan> potentibus Vrbes.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>SECONDLY,</hi> How it happened, that in all the Kingdoms of the <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Heptarchy, the first Founders of which came out of <hi>Frizeland, Westphalia, Holstein</hi> and <hi>Jutland,</hi> the like Great Councils, consisting of the King, the Clergy and Nobility, came to be instituted in each of them? For as to the Representatives of Cities and Towns in <hi>England,</hi> since the Framers of the abovementioned Hypothesis deny their appearance here, I shall say nothing as yet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THIRDLY,</hi> Whether it be probable, that without a General Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Laws and Manners with those People of <hi>Germany,</hi> from whence these <hi>English-Saxons</hi> came, they should by a sort of Natural and Unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Sympathy, fall of themselves into the very same Political Form and Constitution?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FOVRTHLY,</hi> Whether Princes were above a thousand Years ago, so much more Ignorant of the Arts of Government, and so little Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of Riches and Power, that they should all agree within a Century of Years, to set up one uniform Model of Government, and admit the People into a share of their Power, especially into that Grand Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of laying Taxes; which most Princes now do all they can to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form by their own absolute Will?</p>
            <p>FOR as to that of understanding their Subjects Grievances, they might either not take notice of them at all, or else, if they would, might have found out a more easy Method to come to the Knowledg of them, than by Summoning the Clergy, Nobility, and People of a whole Kingdom at once, to acquaint them therewith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FIFTHLY,</hi> How it came to pass, that in all those Countries (so long as they continued <hi>Elective</hi>) the States exercised the same Power of <hi>Deposing</hi> their Kings for Tyranny or Male-Administration? Does this look like a precarious and dependent Power? And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LASTLY,</hi> Whence happen'd it, that in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> (and I believe I could shew the same in other Countries too) the Estates of the Kingdom met twice in the Year, according to Custom, at a certain Time and Place, without any Summons from the King?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="lxxxviii" facs="tcp:93814:47"/>NOW when the Gentlemen who maintain the Hypothesis above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, shall return a fair and satisfactory Answer to these Queries, I shall not only willingly submit to their Judgments, but give them my Thanks for their better Information; but till then I think it is much more agreeable to good Sense, as well as Matter of Fact, to maintain, that those Orders and Degrees of Men that did constitute the Great Councils, were more Antient than Kingly Government, nay Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it self among them, as appears by those Testimonies I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of <hi>Bede</hi> and other Authors; from all whom it plainly appears, that the first Princes in all those Governments were originally Elected, of which I hope I have given undeniable Instances, out of our own as well as Foreign Histories: and certainly that which gives Being to a Thing, must be prior in Nature to that which is produced from it.</p>
            <p>HAVING now done with the Original, I shall next proceed to the Constituent Parts of this <hi>Mycel-Synoth,</hi> or <hi>Wittena-Gemot</hi>; the last of which words is derived from the <hi>Saxon</hi> word <hi>Wites,</hi> or <hi>Witen,</hi> i.e. <hi>Sapientes,</hi> or Wise-Men;<note place="margin">Glossary, Fol. 66.</note> and tho Dr. <hi>Brady</hi> in his Glossary will have this word most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to signify Noblemen, or Great Lawyers, yet I do not find he brings any good Authority for his so doing: For granting it is true, <hi>Wite</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a <hi>Wise-Man,</hi> however it no ways proves that all Wisemen must be Lawyers, much less that those Lawyers were Noblemen; and since he himself does not extend this <hi>Wisdom</hi> only to <hi>Knowledg</hi> in the Laws, I need not say any more to it.</p>
            <p>AS for the rest of his Authorities in this Page, whereby he would prove that divers things were done by the Decrees of these Wisemen or Lawyers, they sufficiently answer themselves; since it appears even by his own shewing, that these <hi>Sapientes</hi> were the Bishops, Abbots, Aldermen and <hi>Thanes</hi>; and when he makes it out that every one of these Orders of Men were Noblemen, or Lawyers, I shall come over to his Opinion.</p>
            <p>AS for what he says in the next Page, where he gives us the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of those words of <hi>Bede, Principibus, &amp; Consiliariis,</hi> by <hi>Eal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dormannum</hi> and <hi>Witum</hi>; they are yet less to the purpose, since a Man might be a very good Counsellor, and yet at the same Time no great Lawyer.</p>
            <p>BUT the Author's seeming stabbing Proof is out of <hi>Asser,</hi> in his Life of King <hi>Alfred,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Id. Fol. 67.</note> 
               <q>Who admiring the Ignorance of his Earls and Praefects, commanded them either forthwith to lay down their <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of <hi>Judicature,</hi> or else to apply themselves <hi>SAPIENTIAE Studiis,</hi> to the <hi>Study</hi> of <hi>Knowledg,</hi> or of the Law. Here we see again (says he) <hi>who</hi> had the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>SAPIENTES,</hi> namely the <hi>Judges,</hi> that is, the <hi>COMITES, PRAEPOSITI, &amp; MINISTRI,</hi> or <hi>Thegnes</hi>; for these last were the <hi>Seminary</hi> of <hi>Nobility,</hi> or <hi>Great Officers, Civil, Military,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> amongst the <hi>Saxons.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>NOW I desire the Reader to observe, that admitting we should take the word <hi>Studia SAPIENTIAE</hi> here, for the <hi>Knowledg</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> does it therefore follow, that all that studied it must be <hi>Lawyers</hi> by Profession? when it is very certain that the <hi>Study</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> was not <hi>then,</hi> nor long after, a <hi>Trade,</hi> as it is <hi>now</hi>; since all the <hi>Freeholders</hi> or <hi>Thegnes,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called <hi>Barons,</hi> were (as well as <hi>Ealdormen</hi>) required to have a competent Knowledg of the Laws of their Country; or else how could they either plead their own, or try each others Causes in the Hundred
<pb n="lxxxix" facs="tcp:93814:47"/>
and County-Courts (as they are in the <note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> Laws of K. <hi>Henry</hi> 1. recited to have done) before the Profession of Counsellors came up?</q> Or how could they sit, and judg Causes in the <hi>County-Court,</hi> or <hi>Folc-mote,</hi> when every <hi>Thegne,</hi> or Gentleman in the County, was capable of being chosen <hi>Sheriff,</hi> and of sitting Judg in those Courts, many Ages before the Office of an <hi>Vnder-Sheriff</hi> was heard of?</p>
            <p>AND as for the <hi>Auctuary</hi> to the 35<hi>th</hi> Law of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Id. ibid. Lamb. <hi>fol.</hi> 147.</note> wherein the <hi>HERETOCHS</hi> are called <hi>BARONES, NOBILES, &amp; insignes SAPIENTES,</hi> there can be nothing urged less to purpose; for then (according to the Doctor) they must have had all great Titles, and have been chosen Generals in War, and Leaders of Armies; and Pray why? because they were <hi>SAPIENTES,</hi> i. e. <hi>Great Lawyers.</hi> But the Doctor had the good luck to find once in his Life, that <hi>Studia Sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae,</hi> for want of a better Expression, signified the <hi>Study</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and therefore the word <hi>SAPIENTES</hi> and <hi>WITES,</hi> where-ever he meets with them in our <hi>Saxon Laws,</hi> or Great Councils, must (forsooth) sig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ify Lawyers or Judges: And his Design in it is evident, that he might thereby confound the <hi>Law-makers</hi> with the ordinary Counsellors or Advisers, whom those <hi>Law-makers</hi> might often imploy in the drawing of the Laws; but he is indeed at last so modest as to tell us, <q>That at this day the Judges, and King's Counsel, and other great Lawyers that sit in the Lord's House, are assistant to the Parliament when there is occasion.</q> But that he would here as well as elsewhere insinuate, that no body else had any more right to appear there than they; you may see more plainly in his Notes to his <note n="*" place="margin">Fol. 85.</note> 
               <hi>Compleat History</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> where upon the words <hi>Sapientes</hi> or <hi>Witen</hi> made use of in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws, he says, <q>That if they only signified Men skilled in the Laws, then were none of the Temporal Nobility present at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of those Laws, unless perhaps they were the Lawyers meant by that word, as being many of them <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Justiciaries</hi> at that time, But yet he is at last forced (with Justice) in the same place to acknowledg, upon the words, that <hi>Witan, Sapientes</hi> or wise Men, must be taken for, or meant of the Bishops and Nobility, or else they were not present at the making of these Laws; which no Man can believe, that considers how many Ecclesiastical Laws there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, and Laws relating to the Worship of God, and a holy Life, that were never made without at least the Advice of the Bishops.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IT is well my Lords the Bishops were concern'd here, or else sure he would never have been so free as to make the word <hi>Witan</hi> signify not only great Lawyers, but Divines too: and thus by the same liberty of paraphrasing, <hi>studia Sapientiae</hi> may signify the Study of Divinity.</p>
            <p>BUT enough of these Trifles; for the Author himself hath some Lines above in the same Notes, granted as much as I can desire, because he confesses, <q>That in our <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws, the <hi>Sapientes</hi> or <hi>Witan</hi> were divers times taken for the whole Baronage, or Nobility, as I may so say: And in this sense it is used in the 49<hi>th</hi> Chapter of the Preface to <hi>Alured</hi>'s Laws.</q> And I desire the Doctor to shew me any Instance out of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws or Annals, if he can, where the words <hi>Witan,</hi> or <hi>Witena-Gemot</hi> are used in any other sense. But what was the true meaning of that word <hi>Baronage</hi> we shall reserve to another place; it suffices at present to let you see he owns they were somewhat more than
<pb n="xc" facs="tcp:93814:48"/>
great Lawyers; and that it comprehended others besides Noble-men by Birth, I shall prove by and by.</p>
            <p>IN the mean time I shall shew, by what Words and Phrases the <hi>Witena Gemot,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Witena Gemot.</hi>
               </note> consisting of these <hi>Wites,</hi> is called in the Latin Version of our Annals, as also of our Historians who have wrote in the same Language.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Concilium Procerum, vel Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
               </note>IN the first of these it is rendered <hi>Concilium PROCERVM,</hi> how truly, I have said somewhat in the Preface: by <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> in his Version of the same <hi>Annals,</hi> it is commonly render'd <hi>Concilium PRIMATVM,</hi> and sometimes, but more rarely, <hi>PROCERVM.</hi> But when this Author would distinguish the Laity from the Clergy at these Assemblies,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Laity and Clergy.</hi>
               </note> he words it thus, <hi>ARCHIEPISCOPOS, EPISCOPOS, ABBATES, &amp; Angliae OPTIMATES</hi>; sometimes thus, <hi>EPISCOPOS, &amp; DVCES, nec non &amp; PRINCIPES, &amp; OPTIMATES Gentis Angliae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS for the Signification of all these Words, I shall give it you anon; only thus much may be agreed upon, that besides the Arch-bishops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and Abbots, the chief or best Men of <hi>England</hi> were present and assisted at these Councils, and who, as appears by the Subscriptions to several <hi>Saxon</hi> Councils and Charters, were either the <hi>Ealdormen,</hi> who writ themselves in Latin, sometimes <hi>Sub-Reguli,</hi> but more often <hi>Duces,</hi> or <hi>Comites,</hi> of whom we have already spoken enough: But this I would have remembred, that the Office of <hi>Ealdormen</hi> not being then heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it was bestowed for Merit; and Nobility by Blood was no necessary Condition to it, since their Places in this great Assembly were only <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Officii,</hi> and not by Right of Inheritance as at this day.</p>
            <p>THE next Order, whose Subscriptions we find at the Conclusion of such Councils and Charters,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Thanes.</hi>
               </note> are the <hi>Thanes</hi>; the highest Degree of which was called <hi>Thanus Regius,</hi> the King's <hi>Thane,</hi> because he held im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately of him; and tho I grant it answered the Title or Dignity of the greater Barons after the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest, yet however nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> nor any other Learned Antiquary that I know of, does any where exclude the two other Degrees of <hi>Thanes, viz.</hi> the <hi>Middle</hi> and <hi>Lesser,</hi> from appearing, and having places in those great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils, as well as the chief <hi>Thanes</hi> themselves.</p>
            <p>AND besides these, we find at the end of several Charters, others who write themselves <hi>Milites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Milites.</hi>
               </note> who, I suppose, ought to be rendered Knights; but whether they were <hi>Thanes</hi> that held by any <hi>Military Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure,</hi> or such as held their Lands <hi>in Allodio,</hi> that is, freely, under no Services, I will not here take upon me to determine.</p>
            <p>THESE are the only Degrees mentioned at the end of those Councils and Charters above-mentioned.</p>
            <p>BUT perhaps it will now be told me, that according to my own shewing, there were no <hi>Commons</hi> summoned to these Assemblies; since neither in the Titles before those Councils, nor at the Conclusions of them is there any mention made of this Order of Men now called <hi>Commons,</hi> distinct from that of the Bishops and great Noble Men; and therefore from hence Dr. <hi>Brady</hi> in his Answer to Mr. <hi>Petyt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Brady's <hi>Introduct.</hi> fol. 6, &amp; 7.</note> will have none but Bishops and great Noble-men to have had any thing to do there: and to make this seem the more plausible, he renders that great Council, where <hi>Plegmund</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Antiquit. Britan. Matth. Parkeri Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiep. Cant.</note> together with King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the <hi>Elder</hi> presided, <hi>viz. CONCILIVM MAGNVM EPISCO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PORVM,
<pb n="xci" facs="tcp:93814:48"/>
ABBATVM, FIDELIVM, PROCERVM, POPVLORVM IN PROVINCIA GEWISORM,</hi> &amp;c. in these words, A great <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Bishops, Abbots, Tenants</hi> in <hi>Capite</hi> or <hi>Military Service, Noble-men,</hi> and <hi>People</hi> in the Province of the <hi>West-Saxons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND here, before I go any further, I would desire the Doctor to answer these two Questions.</p>
            <p>FIRST, By what Authority he here translates the word <hi>Fideles,</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants in <hi>Capite,</hi> or Military Service? since I am sure he is not able to prove from any History or Record, that this <hi>Tenure</hi> had any being in <hi>England</hi> at that time.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, How he can make it out, that the word <hi>Proceres</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways signifies great Noble-men by Birth? without which Supposition all he is able to say on this Subject will fall to the Ground.</p>
            <p>BUT the Doctor thinks he has a great Advantage from what Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Parker</hi> says in the same Page;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Brady, ut sup.</note> 
               <hi>EDWARDVS REX SYNO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DVM PRAEDICTAM NOBILIVM ANGLORVM CONGREGA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIT, CVI PRESIDEBAT PLEGMVNDVS, i. e.</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the foresaid <hi>Synod</hi> of the <hi>English Nobility,</hi> wherein <hi>Plegmund</hi> presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Here he thinks he hath a strong hold, and therefore says, <q>That this Author tells us the meaning of the long Title of this Synod, which just before he had mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Bishops, Abbots, FIDELES, Proceres, &amp; POPVLVS,</hi> were all <hi>NOBILES, NOBLE-MEN,</hi> that is, the <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> and <hi>Laicks,</hi> or the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Lay-Nobility,</hi> and not the <hi>Vulgus, Commons,</hi> or ordinary sort of People.</q>
            </p>
            <p>SO then, according to the Doctor's Construction, all the fore-going Relation of the Members of this Council was a jumbled heap of Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologies, of <hi>Noble Tenants</hi> in <hi>Capite, Noble-men,</hi> and <hi>Noble People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT I must needs acknowledg that he is so far in the right, that by these words <hi>Nobilium Anglorum,</hi> are not meant the <hi>vulgar,</hi> mean or ordinary sort of People, or the <hi>Mob,</hi> (as they are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously term'd) for certainly they had never any thing to do in those August Assemblies: Nor does Mr. <hi>Petyt,</hi> or my self maintain any such thing; and yet for all this I think we may affirm, that all the Members that appeared there, were not Noble-men, or Great Lords only, in the sense they are now taken.</p>
            <p>FOR to begin with the word <hi>Nobilis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nobilis.</hi>
               </note> which the Doctor so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists on, it is his own too narrow Conception of that Title which has been, I think, one main Cause of the greatest part of the Quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mr. <hi>Petyt</hi> and him; for in all the Counties of <hi>Europe,</hi> except <hi>England,</hi> it is very well known, that the word <hi>Nobilis</hi> includes not only Noble-men of Title, such as Dukes, Marquesses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but also all Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of Families who are well born, and do not exercise Mechanick Trades. Thus <hi>Nobilezza</hi> in Italian, and <hi>Noblesse</hi> in French, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the less as well as the greater Nobility. So likewise the word <hi>Aedelmen,</hi> among the <hi>Germans,</hi> comprehends all sorts of Noble-men, as well those of Title as others,<note place="margin">Tit.

               <q>And so it was here in <hi>England</hi> long after the Conquest, as well as before, when Knights and Gentlemen were reckoned <hi>inter Nobiles minores,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Title of Noble-men began to be appropriated to the higher Nobility or Peers only; which is also owned by Dr. <hi>Brady</hi> in his Preface
<pb n="xcii" facs="tcp:93814:49"/>

            </p>
            <p>AND this being so, I shall easily prove, that all the rest of the words insisted upon by the Doctor, do not signify <hi>only</hi> great Lords and Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by Birth:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Proceres.</hi>
               </note> To go on therefore to the next word <hi>Proceres,</hi> that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this does signify <hi>only</hi> Men Noble by Birth. <hi>Isidore</hi> (an antient <hi>Spanish</hi> Author) in his <hi>Origines,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 9. cap. 4.</note> says thus, <hi>Proceres sunt Principes Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium,</hi> that is, the chiefest of Subjects or Citizens. And the Learned <hi>Du-Fresne</hi> also tells us in his Glossary,<note place="margin">Page 420.</note> 
               <hi>Proceres appellabantur, qui in Civita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus praecipuos Magistratus gerebant</hi>; that those were called <hi>Proceres,</hi> who were the chief Magistrates or Rulers in Cities; and certainly these could scarce ever be Noble-men by Birth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Primates.</hi>
               </note>AND as for the word <hi>Primates,</hi> it signifies no more than Principal or Chief Men, however born; and that it was understood no otherwise among our <hi>English-Saxons,</hi> appears from <hi>Aelfric</hi>'s Glossary above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, at the end of <hi>Somner</hi>'s <hi>Saxon</hi> Dictionary, where he renders the words <hi>Primates, vel Primores Civitatis, seu Burgi,</hi> by <hi>YLDEST BVRH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARA, i. e.</hi> the Chief Magistrates in a City or Town, who were then Persons of very considerable Note in the Nation, as I shall prove further by and by.</p>

                  <hi>Optimates.</hi>
               </note>I come now to the word <hi>Optimates,</hi> which signifies no more than the better sort of Men, and not always Noble-men and great Lords, much less as confined to the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Thanes,</hi> or <hi>Tenants</hi> in <hi>Capite</hi> only; since the same <hi>Du-Fresne</hi> in his Glossary defines <hi>Optimates</hi> to be <hi>Vassalli Barones, qui ab ullo Domino ratione Hominii nudè pendent,</hi> that is, the Feudatory Barons that meerly depend on <hi>any</hi> Superiour Lord by reason of their Homage; which tho spoken in relation to <hi>France</hi> five or six hundred Years ago, yet was certainly used in the same sense, and no otherwise in <hi>England,</hi> as well before as after that time, and did include all the Inferiour as well as Superiour <hi>Thanes,</hi> such as were the only Freeholders in those Ages.</p>

               </note>BUT for the word <hi>Principes,</hi> he that understands any thing of the Latin Tongue, knows, that it doth not always signify Princes, or Men Noble by Birth, but any Chief or Principal Man, remarkable by Place, Office or Dignity; and therefore we often read in <hi>Livy,</hi> and other Latin Authors, of <hi>Principes Civitatis:</hi> and in the above-cited Laws out of <hi>Tacitus, de moribus Germanorum,</hi> it is plain, that the word <hi>Princeps,</hi> or <hi>Principes</hi> in the plural, signified no more than chief or considerable Men among the <hi>Germans,</hi> by reason of their Office, or present Dignities, without any respect to their Birth. And in this sense, I suppose, every Member of Parliament may at this day be reckoned <hi>inter Principes,</hi> among the most considerable or chief Men of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>BUT the Doctor lays a great stress upon a Passage out of two Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script <hi>Malmesburies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Brady's <hi>Introduct.</hi> fol. 7.</note> one in the <hi>Bodleian</hi> Library, cited by Sir <hi>William Dugdale,</hi> and the other in the Treasury of the Records of the Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> cited by Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> who both report of this very Council, that <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Elder</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Congregavit Synodum Senatorum Gentis Anglorum, cui praesidebat Plegmundus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> convened a <hi>Synod</hi> of the <hi>Senators</hi> (in <hi>Saxon</hi> the <hi>Aldermen</hi>) of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, that is, such as were usually called to such Councils, which were only the <hi>Nobiles</hi> and Great Men.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xciii" facs="tcp:93814:49"/>IN Answer to this I must refer the Doctor again to good old <hi>Livy,</hi> where he will find that the <hi>Roman</hi> Senators were not all Noble by Birth, for they were <hi>tàm Patricii, quàm Plebeii Ordinis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT when Mr. <hi>Petyt</hi> cites <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> for calling a <hi>Saxon Wittena Gemote, Generalis Senatus &amp; Populi Conventus,</hi> to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the lesser Nobility from the greater, the Doctor replies,<note place="margin">Id. ibid.</note> 
               <q>There is no heed to be taken how our old Monks and Historians stiled the <hi>Saxon Wittena Gemotes,</hi> or their great and <hi>Common-Councils,</hi> for the same Authors expressed them sometimes one way, sometimes another; nor were they ever exact and curious in observing and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Title,</hi> or the <hi>Constituent Parts</hi> or <hi>Members</hi> of them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>FROM whence I cannot but observe the Doctor's great Partiality for his own Opinion; for whenever <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> in the Manuscript above-cited, mentions the word <hi>Senatores,</hi> it must with him immediately signify nothing less than Great <hi>Noblemen,</hi> or what we now call <hi>Peers</hi>; but when the same Author mentions the lower degree of Men (whom we now call <hi>Commons</hi>) as a distinct Order from the Great Lords, or Senators, then presently he is with the Doctor, a trifling old Monk, very little curious in observing the <hi>Constituent Parts</hi> or <hi>Members</hi> of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Great Councils.</q>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING thus shewn some of Dr. <hi>Brady</hi>'s erroneous and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Glosses concerning the <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Nobility before the Conquest, which he vainly supposes to have been the same as it is at this day; I shall now endeavour to settle some truer Notions relating to those Great Councils, which as to the <hi>Lay-Members,</hi> besides the <hi>Ealdormen</hi> above-mentioned, I conceive, consisted of the whole Body of <hi>Thanes,</hi> or <hi>Free-holders,</hi> who were then all <hi>Gentlemen</hi> either by Birth or Estates; for I have already proved from the Laws of King <hi>Athelstan,</hi> that a meer <hi>Ceorl</hi>'s Man, if he had purchased five Hides of <hi>Thane</hi> Land, did thereby become equal in all respects to a <hi>Thane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW if the word <hi>Thane</hi> before the Conquest signified the same with the word <hi>Baro,</hi> which came into common use after that time, as Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> and Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> both grant it did; and Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> in his Introduction to his first Edition of his <hi>Britannia</hi> in 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, is yet more express as to this word <hi>Baro,</hi> as you may see by this remarkable Passage; <hi>Verùm Baro ex illis nominibus videatur quae tempus paulatìm meliora, &amp; molliora reddidit, nam longò post tempore, non milites, sed qui LIBERI erant DOMINI, &amp; Thani Saxonibus dicebantur Barones vocari</hi> coeperunt, <hi>nec dum magni honoris erant, paulò autem posteà</hi> (viz. <hi>some</hi> time after the Conquest) <hi>eò honoris pervenit, ut nomine Baronagii Angliae omnes quodammodo Regni Ordines continuerentur:</hi> tho it must be confest that Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> because he found this Passage had given some Offence to the higher Nobility, he in his next Edition in <hi>Folio,</hi> restrained it by adding the word <hi>Superiores</hi> before <hi>Ordines,</hi> as if none but the <hi>higher Barons</hi> might be thought to have once made part of the Baronage of the Kingdom. And likewise Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> in his Glossary under the Title of <hi>Barones Comitatus, i. e.</hi> the Barons of Counties,<note place="margin">Spelm. Gloss. tit. Barones Comitatus.</note> (who are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mentioned in the Laws of our first <hi>Norman</hi> Kings) has this remarkable Passage, and he being so great a Man, I shall not offer to abridg it.</p>

Which I shall give you thus in English. <q>Under this Title of <hi>Barones Comitatus,</hi> seems to be contained in our antient Writers all sorts of Feudal Barons dwelling in any one County, <hi>viz.</hi> the chief Men and Lords of Mannors, as also all free Tenants, that is, Proprietors of Lands, in English, FREE-HOLDERS. And it is also to be considered, that these free Tenants were not antiently so mean and pitiful, as they are accounted at this day: For Gentlemen had not as yet parcell'd out their Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships and Lordships into small Estates, but (as we see in <hi>Ireland</hi>) keeping them themselves, by their hired Servants and Villains, hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded their own Lands. In the Laws of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor, cap.</hi> 15. it is appointed, that 46 <hi>Marks</hi> should be collected out of the Hundred, and sealed up with the Seal of one of the Barons of the County, and be lodged in the King's Treasury. In <hi>Dooms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> Book, those Noblemen and Gentlemen are called Barons of the County, who presided in County-Courts, that is, who were Judges of those Courts, whom <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. in the 30<hi>th</hi> Chapter of his Laws, shews to be the free Tenants of the County. The King's Judges, <hi>says he,</hi> are the Barons of the County, who have Freehold Lands in them, by whom the Causes of each of them ought to be tried and adjudged in their respective turns.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>AND there also immediately follows in the same Law of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> another Clause, whereby Villains, and all such mean and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly Fellows, called there <hi>Cocsetti</hi> or <hi>Perdingi,</hi> are not to be reckoned amongst the Judges of the Laws; for they neither in the Hundred, nor in the County, forfeit their own Money, nor that of their Masters.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS, I think, is sufficient to prove, that all such base and indigent People, such as Dr. <hi>Brady</hi> calls <hi>Tag, Rag</hi> and <hi>Bobtaile,</hi> were excluded from having any thing to do in these inferior Courts; and if so, then much more to be sure were they shut out of the most August Assembly of the Kingdom, the <hi>Wittena-Gemot, Mycel-Synoth,</hi> or what we now call the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND this I have brought to shew, that I do as much disown the Thoughts of introducing any Degrees or Orders of Men, (less than those of Quality or Estates) into the Great Councils of those Times, as the Doctor himself does.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xcv" facs="tcp:93814:51"/>BUT in the first part of his <hi>Compleat History</hi> he asserts,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Compleat Hist.</hi> Fol. 69, 70.</note> that not only the King's <hi>Thanes,</hi> but also all the Middle and Lesser <hi>Thanes</hi> were both after, as well as before the Conquest, Military Men, who held their Lands by Military or Knight's Service, which he would prove from the <hi>Heregeat,</hi> or <hi>Heriots,</hi> that by the Laws of King <hi>Cnute,</hi> were to be paid to their Lords by their Heirs, in Horses and Money, and certain Arms. <q>Well, let this for once be admitted, but I would then have the Doctor never to urge Military or Knight-Service, as a Badg of the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest any more; and in the next Treatise which he shall please to publish, I would desire him to make it out, that none but the King's <hi>Thanes,</hi> (who were all one with his <hi>Tenants</hi> in <hi>Capite,</hi> after the Conquest) had any Place in the Great Council of the Kingdom, for without this, he does nothing: yet thus much I must say for him, that in the beginning of his Answer to Mr. <hi>Petyt,</hi>

                     <hi>Answer to Mr.</hi> Petyt<hi>'s Rights of the Commons in</hi> Folio. p. 10.</note> he seems to be somewhat more good-natured, making the <hi>Saxon Wittena Gemotes</hi> more large and diffusive; for in them he owns, were <hi>Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Masse-Thegnes,</hi> or <hi>Dignified</hi> and <hi>Great Clergy-Men, Aldermen,</hi> or <hi>Comites, King's Gereves</hi> or <hi>Praepositi, King's Thegnes, Thanes,</hi> or <hi>Ministers,</hi> his <hi>Counsellors, Judges</hi> or <hi>Magistrates.</hi>
               </q> Where tho he confounds the King's Judges and Counsellors, (whose Presence there was not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary, as not being any constituent Parts or Members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) with the Bishops, Aldermen, and <hi>Thanes,</hi> without whose Consent no Laws could be made; yet he grants us enough in reckoning other <hi>Thanes</hi> and Magistrates to have had Places there, besides the King's, and who I conceive had a Right to appear there without any particular Summons to each of them; and sure all these were not <hi>Tenants</hi> in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW having laid down, and I hope established a true Notion what sort of Men then constituted the greater part of the <hi>Wittena-Gemotes</hi> of those Times; I come to the next Degree or Order of Men, who then most properly represented the Commons of <hi>England,</hi>

            <p>THO of what sort of Men these <hi>Procuratores</hi> or Deputies of Cities and Towns then consisted, I confess it is hard at this distance of Time to determine; when the Original Records of those Councils wherein they appeared are lost, and that we have so obscure a mention made of them in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws and Charters.

Rubeus,</hi> who in his History of <hi>Ravenna</hi> under <hi>Anno</hi> 1297. hath this remarkable Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage concerning these <hi>Sapientes</hi>; (says he) <hi>Sed longè anteà illud nomen obtinuit in aliis Longabardarum civitatibus, ut colligere licet ex Ottone, &amp; Acerbo Morena in Historia Rerum Lundevetium</hi>; which Authority tho fetch'd as far as <hi>Italy,</hi> is very pertinent to prove the same Title to have been in use among the <hi>English Saxons</hi> of the same Age with the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards,</hi> since (as <hi>Grotius</hi> hath learnedly proved in his Preface to his <hi>Gothic</hi> History) the <hi>Lombards</hi> were but one Stirp or Tribe of those Antient <hi>Gothes,</hi> from whom (as I have already proved in the beginning of the third Book of this Volume) the <hi>English Saxons</hi> were also derived.</p>
            <p>BUT that these Citizens of Cities, in those Times, might deserve the Name of <hi>Wites</hi> or <hi>Sapientes,</hi> as well for their Prudence as Riches, appears from the Charter of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> in the great Chartu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary of the Abby of <hi>Westminster,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Faustina. A. 3.

            <p>AND as for the City of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in those Times, it had not only a Chief Magistrate, called in Latin <hi>Praepositus,</hi> in <hi>Saxon Port-Gerefa,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> in his Antiquities of <hi>Canterbury</hi> informs us;<note place="margin">Pag. 64, 65.</note> but also in the same Place he has given us a <hi>Saxon</hi> Deed, written some Years before the Conquest, and containing an Exchange of certain Lands and Houses in

that City, made between the Family, (<hi>i. e.</hi> Monks of the Cathedral Church) and the <hi>Crihtan</hi> of that City, being Merchants or Chapmen; and you have already seen, that a Merchant having thrice passed the Seas, was accounted equal to a <hi>Thane:</hi> and can any one then reasonably doubt, that Persons of that Wealth and Dignity were not capable of being chosen Representatives of their Cities, in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Great Councils?</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>THIS is an Authority which seemed so convincing, that Sir <hi>William Dugdale</hi> hath made use of it in his <hi>Origines Juridiciales,</hi> to prove the Antiquity of the Commons of <hi>England</hi> in Parliament; yet Dr. <hi>Brady</hi> in the Conclusion of his Answer to Mr. <hi>Cook</hi>'s <hi>Argumentum Antinormani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> accuses that Gentleman of being both Ignorant and Mistaken in the meaning of Cities and Provinces, and the Persons that came from them, whom he indeed would have to be not any Representatives of Counties and Cities, but only Deans, Arch-Deacons, and other dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified Persons and Church-Officers, as well of the Laity as Clergy, who were summoned by the King to this Synod, from Provinces and Cities, to advise and inform the King of the Conveniency of the Places, whither the Bishops Sees then about to be removed from Villages to Cities, were to be transferred.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT since there is not one word in this Charter said of any such Thing, and that Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> in his Glossary renders the word <hi>Provincia</hi> for a County, and not a Bishop's See; I my self not now having leisure to pursue such Niceties, shall refer the Curious for their farther Satisfaction to the eighth Dialogue of <hi>Bibliotheca Politica,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bibliothec. Politic. pag. 567, 568.</note> where they may read whatsoever he has said against it sufficiently answered.</p>
            <p>THESE are the only Authorities I shall make use of at this Time, to prove that the Cities and Boroughs had then their Delegates or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives in the <hi>Saxon Witena-Gemotes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will now conclude this Point with the Judgment of that Learned Antiquary Mr. <hi>Lambard,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Archeion. p. 256, 257, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> who certainly understood the Constitution of this Antient Government, as well at least, if not better, than Dr. <hi>Brady</hi>; and he tells us,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xcviii" facs="tcp:93814:53"/>
               <q>THAT whereas in the beginning of <hi>each</hi> Law, (<hi>viz.</hi> those made by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings he there mentions) all the Acts are said to pass from the King and his <hi>Wise Men</hi> both of the Clergy and Laity, in the Body of the Laws, each Statute being thus, <hi>And it is the Advice of our</hi> Lord, <hi>and his</hi> Wise-Men: So as it appears that it was then a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Form of Speech, to signify both the Spirituality and the Laity (that is to say, the greater <hi>Nobility,</hi> and the less, or <hi>Commons</hi>) by this one word <hi>Witan,</hi> i. e. <hi>Wise-men.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>NOW as those written Authorities do undoubtedly confirm our Assertion of the Continuance of this manner of <hi>Parliament,</hi> so is there also unwritten Law or Prescription, that doth no less infallibly uphold the same.

                  </note> antient, and so long since decayed, and gone to nought, that it cannot be shewed, that they have been of any Reputation at any time since the Conquest, and much less that they have obtained this Privilege, by the Grant of any King suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the same. So that the Interest which they have in Parliament groweth by an antient Usage before the Conquest, whereof they cannot shew any beginning: which thing is also confirmed by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Usage in the self-same thing; for it is likewise known, that they of <hi>Antient Demesne,</hi> do prescribe in not sending to the Parliament, for which reason also they are neither Contributors to the Wages of the Knights of Shires, neither are they bound by sundry Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, tho the same be generally penn'd, and do make no Exceptions of them. But there is no antient Demesne, saving that only which is described in the Book of <hi>Doomsday,</hi> under the Title of <hi>Terra Regis,</hi> which of necessity must be such as either was in the Hands of the Conqueror himself, who made the Book, or of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> that was before him. And so again, if they of <hi>antient Demesnes</hi> have ever since the Conquest prescribed not to elect Burgesses to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then (no doubt) there was a Parliament before the Conquest, to the which they of other Places did send their Burgesses.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I shall here crave leave to add one Record, tho after the Conquest, in Confirmation of what Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi> hath here learnedly asserted; for that several Boroughs claimed to send Members to Parliament by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription in the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> appears by a <note n="†" place="margin">Rot. Pat. 17. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. pars 1. m. 20.</note> Petition put in to that King <hi>An.</hi> 17 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. wherein the Burgesses of the Town of <hi>Barnstaple</hi> in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> set forth, that it being a free Borough, had by Charter from King <hi>Athelstan,</hi> among other Privileges, a right of sending two Burgesses to all Parliaments for the said Borough; upon which the King and his Council ordered a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Inquiry,</hi> which certainly would never have been done, if Dr. <hi>Brady</hi>'s Notion were true, that the Cities and Boroughs never sent any Representatives to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but once in the 49<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. and then no more till the 18<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> which was but a little above 50 Years to the time of this Petition, which being within the Memory of so many then living, the King and his Council would never have ordered a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Inquiry</hi> about such a vain and idle Pretence.</p>
            <p>FROM all which, I think, it may safely be concluded, that this Learned Antiquary above-mentioned, I mean Mr. <hi>Lambard,</hi> did not without good Authority believe, that not only the Great Lords or Peers,
<pb n="xcix" facs="tcp:93814:53"/>
but also the Inferiour Nobility, and Representatives of Cities and Towns, were included under the word <hi>Witan</hi>; and likewise that those Places claimed that Privilege by Prescription.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore desire the Doctor, that when he writes next upon this Subject, he will please to crave in Aid some Gentlemen of the Long Robe of his Opinion, to help him to answer this Argument of Mr. <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard</hi> from general Prescription; as also what hath been already said concerning this matter in the same Dialogue of <hi>Bibliotheca Politica</hi> above-mentioned, beginning at <hi>pag.</hi> 483, and ending at <hi>pag.</hi> 593, inclusively: and if he can then with his Assistances prove all our antient Lawyers to have been mistaken in this memorable Point, I shall own my self to have been so too. But I desire this may be taken notice of, that no Prescription whatsoever in Law can be laid of later Date, than the first Year of King <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> which began almost fourscore Years before the 49<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. when he fancies the Commons were first summoned to Parliament.</p>
            <p>BUT that I may be as brief as I can, I shall reduce what I have further to say upon this Head, to a few Queries. As,</p>
            <p>FIRST, Whether in all the Kingdoms of <hi>Europe</hi> of the <hi>Gothic</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, beginning with <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and ending with <hi>Scotland,</hi> there can be shewn any of them wherein the Cities and Great Towns, either had not, or at least not till of Modern Times, their particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives in the Common Councils, or Assemblies of the Estates in those Kingdoms?</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, Why in <hi>England</hi> alone, whose King was not more Absolute than in other Neighbouring Kingdoms, and which was framed after the same <hi>Gothic</hi> Constitution, its Cities and antient Boroughs (which were in those Times very considerable for Strength, Trade and Wealth, and guarded by so many Laws made in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Times) should not be thought considerable enough to have any Delegates in the Common Council of the Kingdom, till so long after the Conquest, as the 49<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. which (if we may believe the Doctor) was also intermitted from that time for above the space of twenty Years, till the 18<hi>th</hi> of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>First?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BESIDES which, I would also propose these farther Queries concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Antiquity of the Commons in general. As,</p>
            <p>FIRST, If <hi>Clerus</hi> and <hi>Populus</hi> signify in our Antient Authors the Clergy and Laity, which the Doctor asserts, and I will not oppose; then I would ask him, why (the same word <hi>Clerus</hi> including the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Clergy, <hi>viz.</hi> Deans, Arch-deacons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as the superiour, <hi>viz.</hi> Arch-bishops and Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> assembled in our Great Councils or Synods) the word <hi>Populus</hi> must not be allowed the same Latitude of Signification, and extend to the Gentry, or less Nobility, together with the chief Citizens and Burgesses, by a like Parity of Reason? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he can make it out, that <hi>Clerus</hi> must be understood in a very compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive sense, and <hi>Populus</hi> in a very contracted and narrow one, only to mean Great Lords and Noblemen of the higher Rank.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, I would desire to know of him what the words <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus</hi> and <hi>Populi</hi> shall signify, when put after and distinct from the words <hi>Proceres, Optimates, Senatores,</hi> or <hi>Senatus,</hi> &amp;c. when these words oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in several antient Charters of our <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Kings, as well as
<pb n="c" facs="tcp:93814:54"/>
Historians that make any mention of the Great Councils, unless they mean the <hi>People</hi> or <hi>Commons</hi> distinct from the <hi>Great Lords?</hi> Of which I shall here set down a few Instances out of many, both from Charters, Laws and Historians.</p>
            <p>THE first whereof is found in the Charter of King <hi>Ethelred,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a Grant and Confirmation of several great Privileges to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery of <hi>Wolverhampton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Monastic. Anglican. vol. 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 988. <hi>col.</hi> 2.</note> which concludes in these words, <hi>Haec De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creta sunt</hi> Sigerici <hi>Archiepiscopi in placito coràm Rege</hi> Ethelredo, <hi>&amp;</hi> Ebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racensi <hi>Archiepiscopo, &amp; omnibus Episcopis, Abbatibus Regionis</hi> Britanniae, <hi>seu Senatoribus, Ducibus, &amp;</hi> Populo Terrae.</p>
            <p>THE next is, the third Charter of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor</hi> to the Abbey of <hi>Westminster,</hi> made in a Great Council of the Kingdom, which was held in the last Year of his Reign,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Spelm. Concil. <hi>f.</hi> 625.</note> and concludes thus, <hi>Hanc igitùr Chartam meae Donationis &amp; Libertatis, in die Dedicationis praedictae Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae, recitari jussi, coràm Episcopis, Abbatibus, Comitibus, &amp; omnibus Opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matibus</hi> Angliae, <hi>omníabque;</hi> Populo <hi>audiente &amp; vidente.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW from both these Charters it seems evident, that by the word <hi>Populus,</hi> the Representatives of Cities and Boroughs are here meant and understood, who were present at the sealing of them, as well as the greater Nobility, <hi>viz.</hi> the Senators, Ealdormen and Earls, and the lesser Nobility, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Thanes,</hi> or Freeholders, included under the Title of <hi>Optimates,</hi> since the meer <hi>Vulgar</hi> or <hi>Mob</hi> could never be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Place of the Great Council as Witnesses to the solemn reading and sealing of those Charters.</p>
            <p>MY third Instance shall be that famous Law concerning the Grant of Tithes by King <hi>Ethelwolf, Anno Dom.</hi> 855. which is cited in the <note n="*" place="margin">Lamb. LL. Edw. Regis, <hi>cap.</hi> 8.</note> Laws of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> and confirmed by King <hi>William</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Title <hi>de Apibus, &amp; de aliis minutis Decimis,</hi> wherein it is thus expressed, <hi>Haec (scilicet,</hi> these Tithes) <hi>concessa sunt à Rege, Baronibus, &amp; Populo.</hi> Here it is plain, that the word <hi>Populus</hi> must signify a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Order or Degree of Men from that of the <hi>Barones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Law of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor</hi> being urged by Mr. <hi>Petyt</hi> in his Rights of the Commons asserted, the Doctor passes over in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; but when the ingenious Author of <hi>Argumentum Anti-Norma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicum,</hi> makes use of the same Authority, the Doctor can no longer contain himself,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answer to</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Anti-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orman. <hi>fol.</hi> 297.</note> but in his Answer to that Book, tells him (after an insulting diminutive Reflection upon his Person) that, <q>He thinks this Law was made in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days, and was piping-hot when the Conqueror came in, but (he says) it will prove otherwise upon Examination of it, and also doubtful, whether there was ever such a Law or not made by a <hi>Saxon</hi> Monarch or King.<note place="margin">Lamb. ibid.</note> For after the Law hath enumerated the manner of Tithing in very many things both great and small, requiring an exact Tenth to be paid for most of them; it says, That he which detains the Tenth, if need be, may be forced to Payment by the Justice of the Bishop and King; and then immediately follow these words, <hi>Haec autèm praedicavit Beatus Augustinus, &amp; concessa sunt à REGE, BARONIBVS &amp; POPVLO: Sed posteà</hi> Instinctu Diaboli <hi>multi eam (viz.</hi> decimam) <hi>detinuerunt,</hi> &amp;c. These things St. <hi>Augustine</hi> preached up, and they were granted <hi>by the King, Barons and People,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE rest of the Latin he there cites being not to the Point in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, I pass over; yet I cannot but observe, that from hence the Doctor
<pb n="ci" facs="tcp:93814:54"/>
believes he hath got a notable Advantage over him, for he thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds.</p>
            <p>
               <q>HENCE 'tis evident, that these Concessions of Tithes were made in the time of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> sent hither from <hi>Rome</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent</hi>; for the words, <hi>&amp; concessa sunt à REGE, BARONIBVS ET POPVLO,</hi> can relate to no other than the words immediately preceding, <hi>haec enim praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavit Beatus Augustinus.</hi> And the words next following them do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so prove the same; <hi>sed posteà Instinctu Diaboli, Multi eam detinue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,</hi> &amp;c. which was after they were granted by the King, Barons, and People: so that this was at most but the Confirmation of a Law made by King <hi>Ethelbert</hi>; and how, and by what words the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were expressed near 500 Years after the Law made, and how they were rendred in <hi>Latin</hi> after the coming in of the <hi>Normans,</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siently and without Design to give an Account of them, cannot be of much Value to prove who they were; and that the Laws of King <hi>Edward</hi> were made, or at least translated into <hi>Norman Latin</hi> after the Conquest, appears by the words, <hi>Comites, Barones, Milites, Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes, Servitium, Villanus, Catalla, manutenere,</hi> all <hi>Norman</hi> words, and not known here till their coming hither. He that will assert any thing from a single uncouth Expression in one Case, and upon one Occasion only, brings but a slender Proof for what he says.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THESE are the Doctor's own words which I have transcribed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most <hi>Verbatim,</hi> that I may do not prejudice to the Force of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which in short depends upon this single false Supposition, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Compiler or Drawer up of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws, imagined that this Law concerning Tithes was made by King <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> and was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards confirmed by King <hi>Edward</hi> near 500 Years after the Law was made, when none could tell by what words the first Legislators were express'd.</p>
            <p>BUT if this now should happen to prove otherwise, all that the Doctor has said on this Subject will by an unlucky Mischance fall to the Ground.</p>
            <p>AND I shall shew here, that first of all his Argument is not cogent, that because the words, <hi>&amp; concessa sunt à Rege, Baronibus &amp; Populo,</hi> immediately follow those aforegoing, viz, <hi>Haec enim praedicavit B. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustinus</hi>; therefore this Law could be made by no other than K. <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> since the words are put indefinitely, without mentioning any King in particular.</p>
            <p>FOR St. <hi>Augustine</hi> might preach up Tithes, and yet the Law where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were given to the Clergy might be made many Years after; and that this was so, will appear by a brief History of the Matter of Fact. For first there is not, (nor I believe ever was) any Law extant of King <hi>Ethelbert</hi> concerning Tithes, nor is so much as mentioned by any Writer or Historian that I know of: the first Law, or Canon we find for the paiment of them, being that of the Council or Synod of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuithe,</hi> held under King <hi>Offa, Anno Dom.</hi> 536. and which, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was only an Ecclesiastical Canon, or else because it was not made in a General Council of the whole Kingdom, was not of any U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Obligation, (at least as a Temporal Law) before that famous Grant of Tithes made by King <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> upon his going to <hi>Rome,</hi> and confirmed as a General Law at a Council held at <hi>Winchester</hi> after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
<pb n="cii" facs="tcp:93814:55"/>
               <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 855. and at which not any of the Bishops and Great Lords were present, but an infinite Number of other faithful Subjects, (or Commons as we now call them), I shall shew more at large by and by; and to this, and not to any Law of King <hi>Ethelbert</hi>'s, I doubt not but the Compiler of these Laws of King <hi>Edward</hi> had respect, when he tells us that Tithes were granted <hi>A REGE, BARONIBVS, &amp; PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PVLO,</hi> that is, <hi>by the King, Barons, and People of all</hi> England, and not by those of one petty Kingdom, (as <hi>Kent</hi> was in the Time of King <hi>Ethelbert</hi>) whose Laws could never oblige the whole <hi>English</hi> Nation; and therefore the words that follow, viz. <hi>sed posteà,</hi> &amp;c. must also refer to the Time of making this Law by King <hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> and not to this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Grant of King <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> which the Compiler of these Laws knew nothing of.</p>
            <p>THIS being so, I think all the rest the Doctor says signifies but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; for he is much mistaken notwithstanding he so positively affirms, that all those words he there mentions, were not known here till the coming over of the <hi>Normans</hi>; since he might have found, if he had pleased, the words <hi>Comes</hi> and <hi>Miles</hi> in the singular Number in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions of divers Charters and Laws before the Conquest, and the word <hi>Comites</hi> in the Body of the very Charters themselves; for which I shall only refer him to the first Volume of Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, as well as those in <hi>Monasticon Anglicanum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Baro.</hi>
               </note>AS for the word <hi>Baro,</hi> I grant it did not come into Common or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal use till after the Time he mentions; yet that it was sometimes used before, I shall refer him to <hi>Asserius</hi> his <hi>Annals,</hi> which however it was continued by another Hand till the beginning of the Reign of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Elder,</hi> yet that it was wrote before the Conquest, there is no doubt to be made of it; and in the very last Page of those <hi>Annals</hi> he may find the Names of the <hi>Barones Normannorum,</hi> (as he calls them) who are there related to have been slain.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Villanus.</hi>
               </note>AS for <hi>Villanus</hi> used for a <hi>Ceorle</hi>'s Man, or Country-Man, you may see an Example of the use of that word in King <hi>Athelstan</hi>'s Law above-cited: and the Doctor himself mentions <hi>Terra Villanorum,</hi> i. e. Lands of Villanes or Villagers before the <hi>Norman</hi> Times.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Compleat Hist.</hi> p. 67.</note>
            </p>
            <p>AND as for the rest of the words, viz. <hi>Servientes, Servitium, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talla,</hi> and <hi>Manutenere,</hi> I confess they are not to be met with in the <hi>Latin</hi> Versions of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws made before the Conquest; but I would fain know why they might not have been in use before that Time, tho they are not there mentioned? I am confident no impartial Reader will grant that a Negative Argument is any good Proof to the contrary.</p>
            <p>BUT should I own that the words (<hi>Barones,</hi> and all the rest of them there cited by the Doctor) were not commonly in use till after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, yet that would do him but little Service; for admit that this Law was only briefly recited by the Collector of them in the Form there set down, it will be all one, for the People or Commons were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> (when these Laws were drawn up in the Form we now have them) or else they could never have been mentioned in this Law as a distinct Order of Men, by a Writer who certainly lived long before the 49<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> III. since this Law is found thus worded in <hi>Roger Hoveden</hi>'s Copy of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws, which was written by him (being Secretary to <hi>Henry</hi> II.) above a hundred Years before the Commons (according to the Doctor's <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi>)
<pb n="ciii" facs="tcp:93814:55"/>
were ever heard of: So that unless he can prove that <hi>Henry</hi> III. was before <hi>Henry</hi> II. I think he will but <hi>Aethiopem lavare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT indeed if this <hi>single uncouth Expression</hi> (as the Doctor calls it) had been found <hi>in one Case, and upon one Occasion only,</hi> I confess it might have been as <hi>slender</hi> a <hi>Proof</hi> as he would have it: but when I have not only given him frequent Instances of the use of this word in our Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Charters and Laws, as contradistinct from all the rest of the Orders abovementioned, I think that Pretence will stand him in little stead; and if these are not yet sufficient, I will superadd a few more from our Antient Historians to the same purpose.</p>
            <p>FIRST, From <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> and <hi>Henry Huntington,</hi> who both agree almost in the same words, concerning the Deposition of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gebert</hi> King of the <hi>West-Saxons</hi> for Tyranny and Cruelty, <hi>Anno</hi> 754. <hi>Huntington</hi> expresses it thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Sigebertus <hi>Rex in principio secundi Anni Regni sui, cum incorrigibilis Superbiae &amp; Nequitiae esset, congregati sunt PROCERES &amp; POPVLVS totius Regni, &amp; providâ Deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one Omnium expulsus est à Regno.</hi> Kinewulf <hi>verò Juvenis egregius de Regiâ stirpe, ELECTVS est in Regem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SECONDLY, From <hi>Ailred</hi> Abbot of <hi>Rievalle,</hi> who in his Life of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> giving an Account of the manner of that King's being Elected in his Mother's Womb, tells us,<note place="margin">Decem-Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores, fol. 372.</note> that <hi>Ethelred</hi> his Father having convened a Great Council for the appointing a Successor, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds thus; <hi>Fit Magnus coràm Rege Episcoporum, Procerúm<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>

                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> Consensus.</hi> Wherein he makes a plain Distinction between the Assembly of the great Noble Men, or <hi>Proceres,</hi> from the Consent of the Commons here, called <hi>Plebs</hi> and <hi>Vulgus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND tho I grant with the Doctor, this Story of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Election in his Mother's Womb to have been but a Fiction; yet it is certain, that this Abbot then spoke according to his Belief of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Electing</hi> a King in those Times, and truly sets down the Parties whose Presence and Votes were necessary for the compleating of such an Election, or else he must have spoke as much by way of Prophecy concerning this Matter, as King <hi>Ethelred</hi> and the Estates of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had done about K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s being Elected in his Mother's Womb. And the Reader may remember that these Authors abovecited, lived and wrote many Years before the 49<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> III. when the Doctor supposes the <hi>Commons</hi> were first summoned to Parliament; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not be corrupted with the Notions (not to say Prejudices) of those who wrote after that Time.</p>
            <p>BUT I know the Doctor has a Subterfuge, as he thinks for these plain and full Authoriries, and that is, that by the <hi>Populus, Plebs</hi> and <hi>Vulgus</hi> mentioned as you have heard, the King's <hi>Thanes,</hi> or less <hi>Barons</hi> as they were called after the Conquest, who were all Tenants <hi>in Capite,</hi> are hereby only to be understood; and that no other but they had any Right to be present, and vote in the Great Councils of the Kingdom; and this he has endeavoured to make good in his Answer to Mr. <hi>Petyt</hi>'s abovesaid Treatise.</p>
            <p>BUT since the Doctor's Authorities do there relate to the Times after his Conquest, (concerning which I shall not now say any thing) I will content my self at present with asking him only these two Questions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="civ" facs="tcp:93814:56"/>FIRST, How he will prove, that none but the Persons he there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, appeared in those Councils, since we cannot trace any Footsteps in our most Antient Laws or Historians of his <hi>Tenants</hi> in <hi>Capite,</hi> being the only Constituent Parts of the <hi>Saxon Witena-Gemotes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>AND it was indeed very unlikely they should, if we consider the many Free-Tenants who before the Conquest held in <hi>Allodio</hi> without any Military Services;<note place="margin">Tit. Alodium.</note> and this, as Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> well observes, was opposed to <hi>Feud</hi> or <hi>Fee,</hi> in the Antient Version of King <hi>Canutus</hi> his Laws,<note place="margin">Cap. 75.</note> where it is called in <hi>Saxon, Bockland</hi>; and in the Laws of King <hi>Alfred, Terra Haereditaria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 36.</note> and seems to be the same with our <hi>Fee-Simple,</hi> which might be made over to Strangers without any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence from the Lord of whom such Land was held.</q>
            </p>
            <p>OF which sort of Men there is also frequent mention in <hi>Doomsday</hi> Book, under the Title of <hi>Alloarii</hi> and <hi>Allodiarii,</hi> and of whom it is there also often said, <hi>Potuit ire cum terrâ quo voluit,</hi> or <hi>potuit se vertere ad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium Dominum.</hi> Of these there were certainly many more before the Conquest than afterwards, when I own the greatest part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was in a few Years parcell'd out into <hi>Knights Fees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SECONDLY, I desire to be informed how our Great Councils could consist of such a multitude of Persons, as I find in Antient Charters and Historians to have appeared at those Assemblies, not only before, but long after the Conquest? But of the Period before that Time, (and which I treat of in this Volume) I shall give these remarkable Instances.</p>
            <p>THE first is out of an Antient Manuscript in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library, concerning the League between <hi>Alfred</hi> and <hi>Godrun</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sub effigie Claudii, D. 2. F. 8.</note> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins thus, <hi>Circà Annum Salvatoris nostri</hi> DCCCLXXVI. <hi>in Magno Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilio sive</hi> Mycel-Gemot, <hi>Aluredus Rex Anglorum &amp; Godrunus Rex Anglo-Danorum, &amp; Omnes Angligenae</hi> Sapientes, <hi>&amp; omnis</hi> populus <hi>qui in Anglia mansit, Pacis agenda sive foedus constituerunt, &amp; Juramento confirmaverunt pro seipsis &amp; Junioribus suis Ingenitis.</hi> Wherein this is worth obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that by the <hi>Angligenae Sapientes</hi> here mentioned, the greater <hi>Wites</hi> or <hi>Noblemen</hi> are understood, and by <hi>Populus,</hi> the Representatives of the inferior People or Commons.</p>
            <p>THE next is, that at the end of King <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s Charter of Tythes, <hi>Anno</hi> 855. where you will find after the Subscriptions of the Bishops, Earls and other Great Men,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Spelm. Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cil. f. 350.</note> or <hi>Thanes,</hi> to this Law, these following Parties are mentioned, <hi>Aliorúmque Fidelium infinita Multitudo, qui om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Regium Chirographum laudaverunt, Dignitates verò sua Nomina sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripserunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM whence you may observe, that tho only the Dignified Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons subscribed their Names, yet all the rest of this Multitude had a Right to approve, and give their Consents to what was there transacted: But it cannot be imagined, that this Charter would ever take notice of the Approbation of the meer Rabble without, however they might shew a Joy and Satisfaction at what was there done by their Hollowing and Shouting.</p>
            <p>AND this I conceive to be the Reason why these Councils often met in the open Air, when the Weather would permit, because no one Room could easily hold them; as appears by the Conclusion of King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Charter to <hi>Ely</hi> Abby, bearing date at <hi>Wulsamere, An. Dom.</hi> 970. <hi>Apud</hi> Wlsamere (says the Record) <hi>non clàm in angulo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Charta antiq. in Turri Lond. B.</note> 
               <hi>sed</hi> sub Dio, <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>làm evidentissimè, scientibus totius Regni mei Primatibus</hi>; who were not
<pb n="cv" facs="tcp:93814:56"/>
only <hi>Primates Rega,</hi> the King's Tenants in <hi>Capite,</hi> but <hi>Primates Regni,</hi> the principal or most considerable Men of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I could give several more Instances to prove, that our Antient <hi>Witena-Gemotes</hi> consisted of a much greater number than the Doctor's <hi>Tenants in Capite,</hi> which in the time of his Conqueror were not five or six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Persons, and might not be half that number in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor.</hi> But since the rest of my Authorities fall out in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Period, I shall reserve them to the next succeeding Volume. These are sufficient I think, to make out that long before the time the Doctor allows, the <hi>Commons</hi> had their <hi>Representatives</hi> in the Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils by those of their own Order; but whether by Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, as now at this day, I do not affirm.</p>
            <p>BUT to pass from Charters to the Laws themselves, that prove the <hi>English-Saxons Witena Gemotes,</hi> to have then consisted of a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of People, I shall only instance in the famous Charter of <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolf</hi>'s concerning Tithes, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 855. which being confirmed into a Law at the Common-Council at <hi>Winchester,</hi> there is both in the Copy of this Charter in <hi>Ingulph,</hi> as also in that in Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi>'s first Volume of Councils, this Conclusion (after the Subscriptions of Arch-bishops, Bishops, Earldormen, and others) in these words, <hi>Aliorum<expan>

                  </expan>, Fidelium infinita multitudo, qui omnes Regis Chirographum laudaverunt, Dignitates verò sua nomina subscripserunt,</hi> i. e. there were besides a great multitude of faithful Subjects, who all approved of the Royal Subscriptions; but the Dignities, <hi>i. e.</hi> the dignified Persons alone subscribed their Names.</p>
            <p>NOW I would fain be satisfied from the learned Doctor, or any other who shall next undertake this Controversy, who this <hi>infinita Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delium multitudo</hi> were, that are here said to have approved of this Charter, unless they were the whole Body of the inferiour Nobility, or Freeholders of the Nation, together with the Deputies of Cities and Boroughs, on whose behalf the Dignities are said to have subscribed their Names? since it had been very ridiculuos for this Charter to have mentioned the Assent or Approbation of the <hi>Mob,</hi> or meer Vulgar that only looked on at this Assembly, or to have taken particular notice that these had not subscribed their Names, but only the Persons of great Dignity.</p>
            <p>I come next to consider in whom the <hi>Legislative Power,</hi> or that of <hi>Enacting</hi> and <hi>Repealing</hi> Laws, did then as well as <hi>now consist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Dr. <hi>Johnston</hi> in his Excellency of Monarchical Government, <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. and other high Assertors of the Royal Prerogative, think they have done enough to prove, that the Power of enacting Laws resided wholly in the <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Kings; and for this they cite the <note n="*" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>I shall not dispute the Truth of any of the Authorities these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men produce, but freely confess that the King, as Head of the Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick or Common-weal, is often mentioned, as if he himself made such and such a Law; as we say at this day the Statutes of King <hi>Charles</hi> the
<pb n="cvi" facs="tcp:93814:57"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> or <hi>Second,</hi> tho every body knows that those Laws were enacted with the Consent and Authority of Parliament.</p>
            <p>SO under our <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Kings, tho the King's Authority gave Sanction to the Law, and he might <hi>propter Excellentiam Personae,</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently bid and command in his own Person, yet it was still in such a manner as was consistent with the settled and received Constitution of the Kingdom, which I dare maintain hath not been altered in this Point since that time. Some few Authorities of this sort I will here set down, collected out of the same Books these very Gentlemen have made use of, to which I will also add some antient Charters of indisputable Credit.</p>
            <p>THE first shall be from the Laws of King <hi>Ina,</hi> which you may <hi>see</hi> in the Preface to Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>'s Councils,<note place="margin">Tom. 1. fol. 219.</note> where in a <hi>Mycel Synod</hi> several Ecclesiastical as well as Civil Laws were made to these ends, <hi>viz. ad Concordiam publicam promovendam, per Commune</hi> Concilium, <hi>&amp;</hi> Assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum <hi>Episcoporum, Principum, Procerum, Comitum, &amp; omnium Sapientum Seniorum, &amp; Populorum totius Regni.</hi> And as for the Conclusions of King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Laws, which <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 193.</note> Dr. <hi>Johnston</hi> urges for the King's sole Power in making Laws; they rather make against than for his Opinion, for he there shews us, that this King having commanded his Laws to be written, those that he liked not, he with the Council of his <hi>Wites</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and those he liked, he bad, or commanded to be holden; where I desire the Reader to take notice, that he neither rejected nor command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed these Laws, but <hi>MID MINRA WITENA GETHEAT,</hi> in <hi>Saxon,</hi> that is, with the Consent of his <hi>Witena,</hi> or Council of <hi>Wise-men,</hi> whose Consent and Approbation was certainly necessary in those Laws, as appears by these very words at their Conclusion, which the Doctor himself hath thus translated out of <hi>Saxon</hi>; I <hi>Alfred</hi> King of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> shewed all these (Laws) to all my <hi>Wites (i. e.</hi> Council of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, or Wise-Men) and they said they all liked (or were pleased) they should be holden.</p>
            <p>AND that the <hi>Saxon</hi> word <hi>GETHEAT</hi> signifies somewhat more than bare Counsel or Advice, you may see in the Title to King <hi>Athelstan</hi>'s Laws,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Chronic. Brompt. fol. 848.</note> which is thus, <hi>Haec sunt Judicia quae Sapientes</hi> Exoniae, <hi>Consilio</hi> Adelstani <hi>Regis instituerunt, &amp; iterùm apud</hi> Fueresham, <hi>&amp; tertiâ vice apud</hi> Thundresfeldium, <hi>ubi hoc definitum simul &amp; confirmatum est.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE you may observe, that the <hi>Sapientes,</hi> the <hi>Wites,</hi> or <hi>Wise-men,</hi> are said to institute or make these Judgments or Laws by the Advice of the King, and not He by theirs.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, I will present you with the Title of King <hi>Ethelred</hi>'s Laws,<note place="margin">Brompt. ut supr. col. 893, 894.</note> (as you may see in the same Author) and there we meet with these words, <hi>Hoc est Concilium quod</hi> Ethelredus <hi>Rex, &amp;</hi> Sapientes sui <hi>condixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt ad Emendationem &amp; Augmentum Pacis, omni Populo apud</hi> Wode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocam <hi>in</hi> Mercena Landa, <hi>id est, in terra</hi> Mercenorum.</p>
            <p>FOURTHLY, To another Body of Laws made by the same King <hi>Ethelred,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Idem fol. 895.</note> you will find this Title, <hi>Hae sunt Leges quas</hi> Ethelredus <hi>Rex, &amp;</hi> Sapientes sui <hi>constituerunt apud</hi> Venetyngum, <hi>ad Emendationem Pacis &amp; Faelicitatis Incrementum.</hi>

            <p>BY these two last Titles prefixt to King <hi>Ethelred</hi>'s Decrees, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may please to take notice, that <hi>Concilium</hi> in the first of them does not there signify barely <hi>Advice</hi> or <hi>Counsel,</hi> (tho if it did only do that

it would make but little to these Gentlemens purpose) but it must (and can do nothing else here than) intend and mean the Laws and Statutes which were made in this Great Assembly, not by King <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> alone, but by him and his <hi>Wise-men:</hi> this you find in both of them; for what is called <hi>Concilium</hi> in the former, the latter Title calls <hi>Leges,</hi> and were all enacted by the joint and unanimous Consent of the King and his Great Council.</p>
            <p>I shall now proceed to give you a few Instances from antient Charters: And the first is that out of the great Register of <hi>Abingdon</hi> above-cited, which being thus,<note place="margin">Bibl. Cotton. sub Effig. Claud. B. 9. cap. 31.</note> 
               <hi>Ego</hi> Ecberht <hi>Rex</hi> Occidentalium Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num <hi>cùm Licentia &amp; Consensu totius Gentis nostrae, &amp; Vnanimitate om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium Optimatum,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>FROM whence I shall observe, that as antient as the time of King <hi>Egbert,</hi> the whole <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Nation, as well as the chief Men of it, are said to give not only their Consent, but their License to this Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without which the Authority of the King, and the Unanimity of these chief Men would have signified little.</p>
            <p>THE second Charter is that of King <hi>Cnute</hi> to the Abbey of <hi>Briadri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesworth</hi> (afterwards called St. <hi>Edmundsbury</hi>) now in the Office of the King's Remembrancer of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> the beginning of which runs thus, <note n="*" place="margin">Rot.

            </p>
            <p>THIS Charter is the more remarkable, because made by a Prince who came in partly by Force, and therefore one might have thought he would have exerted a more absolute Power in making Laws by his sole Authority; and yet we find him so far from pretending to do that, that he grants this Charter not only by the <hi>Consent,</hi> but by the <hi>Decree</hi> of the Arch-bishops, Bishops, Abbots, Earls, and all his other <hi>faithful Subjects</hi>; which word (in the Latin, <hi>Fideles</hi>) tho Dr. <hi>Brady</hi> understands it only of Military Tenants <hi>in Capite,</hi> yet I doubt not but it is there to be taken in a much larger sense, and must compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all the lesser <hi>Thanes,</hi> or Freeholders above-mentioned, as also the Deputies or Representatives of Cities and Towns: of which <hi>Fideles</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Spleman</hi> understands <hi>omnes qui in Principis alicujus ditione sunt, vulgò</hi> subjecti: <hi>Hi sunt qui in Historiis dicuntur</hi> Fideles Regis. And also in the same sense it is to be understood in the Oath of Fidelity taken antiently in the Court-Leets, as the same Author shews us,<note place="margin">Spelm. Gloss. f. 225. col. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Tu</hi> J. S. <hi>jurabis quod ab ista die in anteà, eris</hi> Fidelis <hi>&amp; Legalis Domino nostro Regi, &amp; suis Haeredibus; &amp;</hi> Fidelitatem <hi>&amp; Legalitatem ei porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis de vita &amp; membro, &amp; de Terreno honore, &amp; quod tu eorum Malum aut Damnum nec noveris, nec audiveris, quod non defendes (id est,</hi> prohibes) <hi>pro posse tuo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>AND tho I grant this word (<hi>Fideles</hi>) is after the Conquest frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly used for a Military Tenant or Vassal, yet does it likewise even then often extend further than to Tenants <hi>in Capite</hi> only, as I am able to prove from the very Authorities he gives us in his own Glossary, under the Title <hi>Fideles,</hi> were it now worth while to dispute that Point. But in the mean time it lies upon him to make out, that the <hi>Fidelium Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudo</hi> mentioned in King <hi>Athelwolf</hi>'s Charter abovecited, and the <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium
<pb n="cviii" facs="tcp:93814:58"/>
Fidelium</hi> in these, were no other than his Tenants <hi>in Capite,</hi> which when ever he does, (to make use of his own Phrase) <hi>Erit mihi Magnus Apollo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could also give you some Instances to the same Effect out of the <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> under the Years 994, and 1002. in both which it is said ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, <hi>THA GAEREDDE SE KYNG AND HIS WIT AN</hi>; that is, it was Decreed by the King and his <hi>Wites</hi> or <hi>Wisemen,</hi> to make Peace with the <hi>Danes,</hi> and to raise a Tax for that end.</p>
            <p>SO that to conclude, I think this Dispute about the King's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in making of Laws, may easily be reconciled to that which the two Houses of Parliament now exercise, that is, the King makes the Laws, yet by and with the <hi>Assent</hi> of the Lords and Commons, as is declared in the Year-Book of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Third.</hi>
               <note place="margin">22 Edw. 3. f. 3. a. b.</note> And if such their <hi>Assent</hi> be absolutely necessary, can any Man in reason deny their Authority to be Essential in the making of these Laws?</p>
            <p>AND therefore <hi>Bracton</hi> understood well enough what he wrote, when he tells us, <hi>Cam Legis Vigorem habeat Quicquid de Consilio &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensu Magnatum, &amp; Reipublicae Communi sponsione, Authoritate Principis praecedente, jaste fuerit Definitum &amp; Approbatum</hi>; i. e. <q>That whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath been rightly decreed and approved of by the Advice and Consent of the Chief Men, and the General Agreement of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth, the Prince's Authority preceding, carries thenceforth the Force of a Law.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WHEREBY it appears that in this Great Man's Time, the King gave his Consent to Laws first, by ordering them to be drawn up by his Council, and proposed to the Parliament when they met; and that it was in their Power either to accept or refuse them, as we see it is in Charters and Acts of Pardon at this Day, when they are Passed and Confirmed by both Houses; and for this see the Preface to the Statute of <hi>Westminster</hi> the <hi>Third.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS for the Judicial Power of this <hi>Witena-Gemote,</hi> in Banishing great and notorious Offenders against the King and Kingdom, whose Crimes were either not directly Treason according to the strict Letter of the Law, or else their Persons being too great for any other less Court of Judicature; you may find divers Examples in our <hi>Annals</hi> and Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>viz.</hi> under the Years 1048, 1052, 1055. But I do not find any great Lord or Nobleman condemned to Death, or attainted by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Council, till long after the Conquest.</p>
            <p>HAVING now shewn the Antient Authority of the Estates of the Kingdom to have been always necessary and concurrent, (I do not say co-ordinate) with that of the King, and also what other Powers they constantly then used; in the next Place I come to observe the near Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and Union of both Church and State in their <hi>Mycel-Synods</hi> or <hi>Witena-Gemotes</hi>; which lets us see what kind of Supremacy our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish-Saxon</hi> Kings then exercised in Church Matters, as also who they were that at that Time made <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> as well as <hi>Civil</hi> Laws: and I shall give it you in the Words of a very Learned Lawyer lately deceased,<note place="margin">

               <q>AFTER the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> had spread among the <hi>Saxons,</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> frequently held <hi>Synods</hi> without the <hi>Laity</hi> for Church-Visitation,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>THESE Synods may easily be distinguished from our <hi>Mycel-Synods</hi> or <hi>Witena-Gemotes,</hi> not only by the Matters transacted in them, but by the Persons that therein presided, and subscribed them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pope's Legate, or else the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> or <hi>York,</hi> and the Bishops, Abbots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without the Names of any Temporal Persons present thereat, when they were meer Ecclesiastical Synods; but if they were mixt as well for Temporal as Ecclesiastical Matters, both the King and Arch-Bishop are said to preside, otherwise the King alone: and before the Union of the Heptarchy into one Kingdom, these Synods were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly held in the Dominions of that King who was then most Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, so that the lesser or weaker Princes were fain to appear therein in Person, or by their Deputies; but if they did not appear there, nor yet send any Deputies, those Councils were looked upon as to all Temporal and Ecclesiastical Matters, no other than particular Synods, or Councils of those Kingdoms wherein they were held, or whose Kings consented to them; for which I could give you several Instances were it not to avoid being tedious; but for this I refer the Reader to the first Volume of Sir <hi>H. Spelman,</hi> as also to divers Charters in <hi>Monast. Anglican.</hi> and <hi>Ingulf</hi>; some of which are taken notice of in this <hi>Introduction,</hi> and the following History. This I thought fit to superadd, the better to explain what our Learned Author hath said upon this Point.</p>
            <p>BUT notwithstanding he there further observes, <q>That the Clergy themselves, both as to Doctrine, Discipline, and Ceremonies, were bound by the Publick Laws of the Kingdom, enacted in the <hi>Great Councils</hi> of the Nation; concerning which he gives us these ensuing Instances.</q>

               <q>IN the Year 673. <hi>Concilium</hi> Herudfordiae <hi>celebratum est sub initio primi Anni</hi> Lotharii <hi>Regis</hi> Cantiae, <hi>praesidente</hi> Theodoro Cantuariae <hi>Archiepiscopo.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. Westm. fol. 122, 123.</note> At this Council (says <hi>Matthew Westminster</hi>) were

            <p>
               <q>THE Presence of the <hi>Bishops</hi> and all the <hi>Magnates,</hi> makes this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly appear to have been a <hi>Parliament</hi> of those Times.

               <q>MANY Instances of this kind might have been added, as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that of the Council at <hi>Hatfield, Anno</hi> 680, wherein the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> of five <hi>General Councils</hi> were received, which was a <hi>Witèna-Gemot,</hi> a <hi>Conventus Sapientum</hi>; but I spare time, and am indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to open a Door.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>BY these Instances it is apparent, that the same Body of Men that enacted the <hi>Temporal Laws</hi> of the Kingdom did in the very same <hi>Councils</hi> make Laws for the Government of the Church. Indeed, the whole Fabrick of the <hi>English-Saxon Church</hi> was built upon Acts of Parliament; nothing in which the whole Community was concern'd, was enacted, decreed, or established, but by that Authority. For whoso reads impartially the Histories of those Times, and compares them with one another, will find, that as most of those antient <hi>Councils,</hi> commonly so called, were no other than (to speak in our Modern Language) <hi>Parliaments</hi>; so not any thing whatsoever in <hi>Religion,</hi> obligatory to the <hi>People,</hi> whether in Matters of <hi>Faith, Discipline, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,</hi> or any <hi>Religious Observances,</hi> was imposed, but in such Assemblies as no Man can deny to have been Parliaments of those times, that has not a Fore-head of Brass. For the Presence not of the Kings only, but of the <hi>Duces, Principes, Satrapae, Populus Terrae,</hi> &amp;c. shews sufficiently, that neither the <hi>Kings</hi> and the Clergy, without the concurrent Authority of the same Persons that enacted <hi>Temporal Laws,</hi> could prescribe <hi>General Laws</hi> in Matters of <hi>Religion.</hi> I do not dispute what Orders of Men among the <hi>Saxons</hi> were described by <hi>Duces, Principes,</hi> &amp;c. but sure I am, that they were <hi>Lay-men,</hi> and as sure, that they <hi>assented</hi> to, and <hi>confirmed</hi> those Laws, without whose <hi>Assent</hi> they were no Laws: so that the <hi>Kings</hi> of those Times had no greater <hi>Legislative Power</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiastical Matters</hi> than in <hi>Temporal.</hi>

               <q>THE tearing the <hi>Ecclesiastical Power</hi> from the <hi>Temporal,</hi> was the great Root of the <hi>Papacy:</hi> It was that mounted it to this heighth; those Powers never were distinct in <hi>England,</hi> nor most other Nations, till that <hi>See</hi> got the Ascendant. And it is strange Inconsistency to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue one while, that <hi>whatever the Pope</hi> de facto, <hi>formerly did by the Canon Law, that</hi> of Right <hi>belongs to our Kings</hi>; and another while,
<pb n="cxii" facs="tcp:93814:60"/>
that the several Acts that restore the <hi>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction to the Crown,</hi> are but <hi>declarative.</hi> It shews how little the <hi>Supremacy</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by Modern Assertors of it, and how little they are acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Antient Government of <hi>England.</hi>

               <q>I will give no more Instances before the Conquest, tho numbers are to be had which lie scattered up and down in the <hi>Monkish Histories,</hi> which being compared with one another, will sufficiently disclose what I assert. For sometimes <hi>Laws</hi> that concert <hi>Temporal Affairs,</hi> as well as <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> are said to have been made by such a <hi>King</hi> in one Author, which very Laws another <hi>Historian</hi> tells us were made in the <hi>Great Council,</hi> for which yet they have no uniform, appropriated Expression, Term, or Denomination: Just as we in common Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance say, King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> or King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Seventh</hi> made such a Law, which yet every Man understands to have been made in Parliament, because else it were not a Law.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="cxiii" facs="tcp:93814:60"/>SO far have I made bold with the words of this Learned Gentleman: I shall now, by way of Confirmation to what he hath said, observe, from Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi>'s Edition of his <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Laws (which was a different Copy from that,<note place="margin">Lamb. Archai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onomia, f. 57. &amp; dein.</note> from whence Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> published his Councils) that our <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws both Ecclesiastical and Civil, were made by one and the same Authority, as appears by the Preface to the Laws of King <hi>Edmund,</hi> which we find runs thus, Aedmundus <hi>Rex ipso solemni</hi> Paschatis <hi>Festo, frequentem</hi> Londini <hi>tàm Ecclesiasticorum quàm Laicorum Coetum celebravit,</hi> &amp;c. So likewise in the Laws of King <hi>Edgar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Id. fol. 62.</note> the Preface of which is thus, <hi>Leges quas</hi> Edgarus <hi>Rex frequenti Senatu, ad Dei Gloriam, &amp; Reipublicae utilitatem, sancivit.</hi> In the <hi>Saxon</hi> Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal thus, <hi>MID HIS WITENA GEHEAHTE GERAED,</hi> that is, with the Council of his Wise-men he established. The Laws of King <hi>Cnute</hi> likewise begin thus, <hi>Consultum quod</hi> Canutus Anglorum,<note place="margin">Id. fol. 97.</note> Dacorum, <hi>&amp;</hi> Norwegiorum <hi>Rex, ex Sapientûm Concilio sancivit.</hi> (Note, the words in the <hi>Saxon</hi> are the same as above.)</p>
            <p>I could illustrate this further by several more Instances out of the same Volume, were I not afraid of having already trespassed too much upon you; only I desire you would please to take notice, that in each Body of these above-mentioned Laws, the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> precede, and then the <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Temporal</hi> follow, tho being both made at the same time, in the same Council, and by the joint Authority of the same Parties.</p>
            <p>BUT now to add one thing more from the said Author, Mr. <hi>Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington,</hi> which is, <q>That <hi>Bishopricks</hi> and other <hi>Ecclesiastical Dignities</hi> were in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Times (commonly) conferred in <hi>Parliament</hi>; we have the Testimony of <hi>Ingulphus,</hi> who was Abbot of <hi>Crowland</hi> in King <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror's Reign; <hi>à multis annis retroactis nulla erat Electio Praelatorum merè libera &amp; Canonica: sed omnes Dignitates tàm Episcoporum, quàm Abbatum, Regis</hi> Curia <hi>pro suâ complacentiâ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferebat:</hi> that is, says he, that for many Years past, there was no Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Prelates absolutely free and Canonical:</q> But all Dignities both of Bishops and Abbots, were conferred by the King's Court (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Great Council of the Kingdom, as I shall prove by and by) according to their good Pleasure.</p>
            <p>AFTER which, the Person so elected, being first consecrated, the King invested him with the Temporalties, <hi>per traditionem Baculi &amp; Annuli,</hi> as you will find in the same Author.</p>
            <p>AND that this Custom was very antient will appear by the Election of <hi>Wilfrid</hi> to be Bishop of <hi>Hagulstade,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In vitâ Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fridi, cap. 11. edit. per Rev. Dom. Dr. Gale fol. 46.</note> 
               <hi>Anno</hi> 666. for <hi>Stephen Heddi</hi> expresly tells us in his Life, <hi>Reges deindè Concilium cum sapientibus suae Gentis post spatium inierunt, quem eligerent in sedem vacantem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponderunt Omnes uno Consensu, Neminem habemus meliorem &amp; digniorem nostrae Gentis, quàm</hi> Wilfridum <hi>Presbyterum &amp; Abbatem.</hi> Then the two Kings (<hi>i. e.</hi> of <hi>Northumberland</hi>) after some time held a Council with the Wise-men of their own Nation, to consider whom they should choose to fill up the vacant See, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they all unanimously answered, We have none fitter nor more worthy in our Nation, than <hi>Wilfrid</hi> the Presbyter and Abbot; and thereupon being presently elected, he was consecrated Bishop.</p>
            <p>THE next Authority of much what the same time you may find in an antient Manuscript-Life of St. <hi>Erkenwald</hi> in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library,<note place="margin">Claudius A. 5.</note> where are these words, <hi>Contigit autèm Episcopus</hi> Londonicae <hi>sedis,</hi> Cedda
<pb n="cxiv" facs="tcp:93814:61"/>
               <hi>migravit ad Dominum, consensu verò</hi> Sebbae <hi>Regis, &amp; vocabulo universae plebis, vir Domini</hi> Erkenwaldus <hi>in Cathredrâ Pontificali sublimatus est,</hi> i. e. but it happened, that <hi>Cedda</hi> Bishop of <hi>London</hi> deceasing, <hi>Erkenwald,</hi> that holy Man, by the Consent of King <hi>Sebba,</hi> and the Nomination of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>People,</hi> was promoted to the Episcopal Throne.</p>
            <p>BUT long after this, as a Nameless Author of the Manuscript-Life of St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> informs us,<note place="margin">Bibl. Cotton. Vitellius D. 17.</note> he was made Bishop after this manner, <hi>viz. Postea, Anno</hi> 958. <hi>factus est magnus sapientûm Conventus, in loco, qui voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi> Bradanforde, <hi>&amp; eo omnium ex electione ordinatus est</hi> Dunstanus <hi>ad Episcopum</hi> Wigornensem. To wit, that afterwards, <hi>scilicet,</hi> in the Year 958. a Great Council of the Wise-men of the Kingdom, was held at <hi>Bradanforde,</hi> and there by the Election of them all <hi>Dunstan</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to be Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> &amp;c. and then the King finding how well he discharged that Trust, the same Author tells us, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him the Church of <hi>London,</hi> then void by the Death of its Pastor, or Bishop.</p>
            <p>THIS Nomination of the King's must be understood in the same sense with that which went before, as well as with what immediately follows, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Brihthelm,</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> being depriv'd, a little after he retired to his Monastery, and then <hi>Rex, scilicet,</hi> Edgarus, <hi>ex Divino respectu, &amp; Sapientûm Consilio, constituit</hi> Dunstanum <hi>ad su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m praedicta Ecclesiae Sacerdotem</hi>; King <hi>Edgar,</hi> both from a Divine respect, and from the Counsel of his Wise-men, constituted <hi>Dunstan</hi> chief Bishop of that Church.</p>
            <p>THE next Example we have, is that of St. <hi>Wulstan,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> who (as it is related by a Monk of that Church in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript-Life of that Saint, about <hi>Anno</hi> 1170.) being sent for on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be made a Bishop, he gives us the manner of his being elected thus, <hi>Sanctus ergò ad Curiam exhibitus, jubetur suscipere Donum Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tûs; contrà ille niti, &amp; se tanto honori imparem (cunctis reclamitantibus) clamitare, adeò concors populus in unam venerat sententiam, ut non peccaret qui diceret in tot corporibus in hoc duntaxat negotio unam conflatam esse Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam.</hi> This holy Man being called before the Great Council, (for so <hi>Curia</hi> in this place is certainly to be understood) he was commanded to accept the Gift of a Bishoprick; but he endeavoured all he could to wave the Acceptance of it, alledging, that he was altogether unfit for so great an Honour; but the whole Assembly not admitting his Excuse, they all unanimously came to this Resolution, that one should not have told a Lie who had said in this particular Affair, that one Soul had ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated so many Bodies.</p>
            <p>SO that it was not without very good Cause, that <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> tells us concerning this Bishop's Election,<note place="margin">Mat. Paris. fol. 20.</note> there concurred <hi>Plebis Petitio, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas Episcoporum, Gratia Procerum, Regis Authoritas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING thus given you so many good Authorities from antient Manuscripts and approved Historians of the Power of those Great Councils in the <hi>Election</hi> of Bishops, I shall only add a few more from our <hi>Saxon Annals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE first is under <hi>Anno</hi> 970, which relates, that then <hi>Oskytel,</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>York</hi> deceased, who had been by the Consent of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Martyr,</hi> and all his Wise-men, consecrated Arch-bishop of that See.</p>
            <p>THE next is under <hi>Anno</hi> 994. and there we read, that <hi>Sigeric</hi> the Arch-bishop deceasing, <hi>Aelfric</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> was elected in his
<pb n="cxv" facs="tcp:93814:61"/>
room on Easter-day at <hi>Ambresbury,</hi> by King <hi>Aethelred,</hi> and all his Wise-men; from whence it appears, that not only the King, but the Great Council of the Kingdom had a share in this Election.</p>
            <p>I could give you also several Instances in the said <hi>Annals</hi> of divers Abbots elected in the same Assemblies to the greater Monasteries; but I hope what I have done already is sufficient to my present Purpose, and therefore shall leave it to the Reader's Judgment to consider, whether, when these <hi>Annals</hi> and Historians inform us, that <hi>Rex constituit</hi> such and such a Man to be Bishop or Arch-Bishop of such or such a See, it is not to be understood in the same Sense as we have already observed from Mr. <hi>Washington</hi>'s said Treatise; that when this or that <hi>King</hi> is said to have made such or such a <hi>Law,</hi> it is still to be understood as made in <hi>Parliament?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall now say somewhat of the same Great Council's Power in the <hi>Deprivation</hi> of Bishops, of which I shall not trouble you with many, but they shall be such Examples as are of undeniable Authority.</p>
            <p>THE first is from <hi>Osbern</hi> in his Life of Arch-Bishop <hi>Dunstan,</hi> lately printed in the first Volume of <hi>Anglia Sacra,</hi> concerning the Deprivation of Arch-Bishop <hi>Brihthelme</hi> abovementioned in these words, Bryhtelmus <hi>post paucos suscepti Pontificatus dies, cogitans quod ad tantam rem minùs esset Idoneus, jussus à Rege &amp; Omni populo discedere, discessit, at<expan>

                  <hi>Bryhtelme</hi> within a few Days after he had received his Bishoprick, not thinking with himself that he was fit for so great a Charge, being commanded by the King and all the People to quit it, departed, and returned to the Church he had lately left, though not without Shame.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT that <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Wallingford</hi> was very well satisfied, that this Arch-Bishop was deprived by the Lay, as well as Spiritual part of the Great Council, appears by his Chronicle, where having set forth his unfi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ness by reason of his too great Easiness and Softness of Temper, he proceeds thus, <hi>Rex</hi> Edgarus <hi>eadem via quâ ascenderat, fecit eum descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere; nam Concione super hoc eodem facta, objecit</hi> Bryhthelmo <hi>plura Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitula, nimiam ipsius remissionem morum argumenta, &amp; condictione &amp; Assensu Baronum suorum ad curam Solius</hi> Dorcasinae <hi>Ecclesiae relabi fecit,</hi> that is, <q>King <hi>Edgar</hi> made him to go down the same way he got up; for a Council being called for this very Matter, he objected several Articles against this <hi>Bryhtelme,</hi> shewing his too great Easiness and Remissness in Discipline; and thereupon by the Appointment and Assent of his Barons, he caused him to retire to the Cure of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Church of <hi>Dorchester.</hi>
               </q> By which it is evident, that this Author (living in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Third</hi>) was very well satisfied that the Temporal as well as the Spiritual Barons, were concerned in this Deprivation.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I was likewise from the Authority of the <hi>Saxon Annals,</hi> as also of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> about to have here also added the Deprivation of one <hi>Siward,</hi> who is reported by the <hi>Annals, An.</hi> 1043. to have been privately Consecrated to the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with the King's good liking, by Arch-bishop <hi>Eadsige,</hi> and who then laid down that Charge: and of which <hi>Siward,</hi>

               </q> So much I thought fit to let the Reader know, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in this History under <hi>Anno</hi> 1043, being deceived by the express words of the <hi>Annals,</hi> I have there made this <hi>Siward</hi> to have been Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and deprived for his Ingratitude to his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor, which I am (upon better Consideration) now convinced to have been a Mistake.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude with our <hi>Saxon Annals,</hi> which under the Year 1052. relate, that Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> having in a Great Council held at <hi>London,</hi> purged himself and his Sons of the Crimes laid to their Charge; and being thereupon restored, Arch-Bishop <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>Norman,</hi> his Enemy, (having just before fled away into his own Country) was not only by a Decree of this Council banis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, but also deprived of his Arch-bishoprick; and <hi>Stigand</hi> then was advanced to that See in his stead, which certainly was done by the same Authority as deprived the former: and if so, then I think none can deny but that Power might also have deprived any other inferior Bishop; and yet we do no where find there was any Schism in <hi>England</hi> among the Clergy at that Time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these two Primates of the Church had been deprived without their own Consent, by the Lay, as well as Spiritual part of the Great Council.</p>
            <p>HAVING now finished all I had to say concerning the Power of the King, and the <hi>Witena-Gemote</hi> in Ecclesiastical Matters, I would not be thought to assert that they have the like Authorities in Matters of <hi>meer Spiritual Cognizance,</hi> since I am very well satisfied of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Institution of the Episcopal Order, from the first Preaching of Christianity in the Time of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to the Restoration of it in this Island upon the Conversion of the <hi>Saxons</hi>; which is not liable to be abrogated by any Temporal Power, and which has been continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Britains</hi> or <hi>Welsh,</hi> without any Interruption from thence, even to our own Times.</p>
            <p>
               <q>BUT as for the Ecclesiastical Power, it was at first settled under the two Arch-bishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> who had then no Jurisdiction or Preheminence the one over the other; the former being Primate of the Southern, as the latter was of the Northern parts of <hi>England:</hi> only I cannot but observe,<note place="margin">

performing the Solemnities of the Church, and in exercising the Authority of an Arch-Deacon;</q>
            </p>
            <p>AND no doubt had also the Episcopal Powers of Ordination and Confirmation, or else he could have been no Bishop. I observe this to let you see, that the <hi>English</hi> were not then so strictly tied up as not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of more than one Bishop in one City.</p>
            <p>BUT since I have chiefly designed to speak of Civil Affairs, I shall not here meddle with the Ecclesiastical Authority of the Bishops or their Courts, or the Officers belonging to them, but will leave them to those to whose Province it does more peculiarly appertain.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus dispatched what I had to say concerning the Synods and Great Councils of the Kingdom in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Times, I shall in the next Place treat of the <hi>English</hi> Laws before the Conquest;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Laws before the Conquest.</hi>
               </note> and they were of two kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> either the particular Customs or Laws of the several divisions of the Kingdom in which those Customs were in use; or else such Additions to, or Emendations of them, as were made from time to time by the Great Council of the whole Kingdom, concerning the Punishment of Crimes, the manner of holding Men to their good Behaviour, or relating to the Alteration of Property either in Lands or Goods; with divers other particulars, for which I refer you to the Laws themselves, as I have extracted them from Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lambard,</hi> their Learned Collections: and some concerning each of these particulars, I have given you in the following Work.</p>
            <p>BUT to shew you in the first place the Original of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Laws,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the</hi> Saxon <hi>Customary Laws.</hi>
               </note> they were certainly derived from each of the Great Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that settled themselves in this Island before the <hi>Heptarchy</hi> was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into one Kingdom; but indeed after the <hi>Danes</hi> had settled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves here in <hi>England,</hi> we find they were divided into these three sorts of Laws, in the beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor</hi>'s Reign, according to the several parts of the Kingdom wherein they prevailed; as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>MERCHEN-LAGE,</hi> or the <hi>Mercian Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Merchen-Lage.</hi>
               </note> which took place in the Counties of <hi>Glocester, Worcester, Hereford, Warwick, Oxon, Chester, Salop</hi> and <hi>Stafford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>WEST-Saxon-Lage,</hi> or the Law of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>West-Saxon-Lage.</hi>
               </note> which was in use in the Counties of <hi>Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Berks, Southampton, Somerset, Dorset, Devon</hi> and <hi>Cornwal</hi>; I mean that part of it which spoke <hi>English,</hi> the rest being governed by their own (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the <hi>British</hi> Laws.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>DANE-Lage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. <hi>Dane-Lage.</hi>
               </note> or the Laws which the <hi>Danes</hi> introduced here into those Counties where they chiefly fixed, <hi>viz.</hi> in those of <hi>York, Derby, Nottingham, Leicester, Lincoln, Northampton, Bucks, Hertford, Essex, Middlesex, Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Cambridg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT as for <hi>Cumberland, Northumberland,</hi> and <hi>Westmoreland,</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they are omitted in this Catalogue, because in the Times not long before the Conquest, the first was under the Power of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and consequently under their Laws, as the two latter were under that of their own Earls, who ruled those Counties as <hi>Feudatary</hi> Princes under the Kings of <hi>England</hi>; tho thus much is certain, that the <hi>Danish</hi> Laws took Place there as well as in <hi>Yorkshire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT after King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor</hi> came to the Crown, he reduced the whole Kingdom under one General; for thus says <hi>Ranulph Higden,</hi>

            <p>HAVING now given you the Original of our Laws in General, we will next proceed to shew you what they were in particular, as far as they concern those two great Branches of all Municipal Laws, <hi>viz.</hi> the Civil or the Criminal: The former o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="cxix" facs="tcp:93814:63"/>I have been the more exact in putting down this Passage, because it plainly proves, from the learned Doctor's own shewing, that if the greatest part of the Lands before the Conquest, held by Men of any Quality, were <hi>Bocland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Compl. Hist.</hi> pag. 66, 67.</note> and that this <hi>Bocland</hi> was the same (as he grants) with Lands held in <hi>Allodio</hi>; (and I have already proved that such Lands were held without any Paiments or Services, other than such publick Taxes as were imposed by the <hi>Great Council</hi> of the Kingdom; that is, <hi>Danegelt,</hi> with such other Duties as all Lands whatsoever were liable to:) then is it also as evident that these Lands, which were far the greatest part of the Lands in the Kingdom, were not held by Knight's Service, and consequently their Owners could not be Tenants <hi>in Capite,</hi> as this Author is pleased in other Places to suppose; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these Tenants in <hi>Allodio</hi> could never be so represented by such Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Persons, as that they alone could either make Laws for them, or lay Taxes on their Estates, without their Consents either by themselves or Representatives in the Great Councils or Parliaments of those Times; and therefore such free Tenants must have either appeared for themselves in Person, or have chosen others to represent them.</p>
            <p>AND if any Man doubt whether these Lands held in <hi>Allodio,</hi> were before the Conquest the greatest part of the Lands of the Kingdom; I must refer them for their Satisfaction to Mr. <hi>Somners</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi>'s Treatises upon <hi>Gavelkind,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 603.</note> as also to Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi>'s Discourse of the Customs of <hi>Kent,</hi> at the end of his <hi>Perambulation</hi> of that County; who there fully prove, that the Antient <hi>Bocland</hi> descending to all the Male Issue alike, was not meer <hi>Socage</hi> Tenure, but <hi>Allodial.</hi> 2<hi>dly,</hi> That this was the general Tenure of all Lands not held by Knights Service before the Conquest, (as well <hi>Gavelkind</hi> as others) and that not only at the Common Law, but confirmed by divers <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings; as by that Law of King <hi>Edmund, Si quis intestatus obierit, Liberi ejus haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatem aequalitèr dividant:</hi> So likewise by the 68<hi>th</hi> and 75<hi>th</hi> Laws of King <hi>Cnute,</hi> as also by those of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> confirmed by <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> Cap. 36. And therefore Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> in his said Treatise of <hi>Gavelkind,</hi> farther proves, that this was a Liberty left to the <hi>Kentish</hi> Men by <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> when all the rest of <hi>England</hi> changed its Antient Tenure; and Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> in his History of <hi>Gavelkind,</hi> Chap. 6, 7, 8. hath proved this to have been a general Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, not only in <hi>Kent,</hi> but in <hi>Wales</hi> and several parts of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not any further pursue what the Doctor has said of Lands holden by Military Service before the Conquest, or of the <hi>Herriots</hi> or <hi>Reliefs</hi> that were due upon them, which were payable out of the <hi>Feudal</hi> Lands of the Ealdormen, middle and less <hi>Thanes</hi>; but shall refer you to the Laws of King <hi>Cnute,</hi> and those of the <hi>Confessor,</hi> the former of which you will find at the end of his Reign in the ensuing Volume, wherein is set down what the Heirs of each of those <hi>Feudatary</hi> Tenants were to pay to their Lords at the Death of their Ancestors.</p>
            <p>BUT that these could not be near all the Lands of <hi>England,</hi> appears by what hath been already said of Lands held in <hi>Allodio.</hi> And I have known some Learned Antiquaries, who have not without good Cause believed that all Tenure by Knight-Service in <hi>England,</hi> was derived from the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Norwegians,</hi> who upon their Conquests and settling here, first brought in that sort of Tenure out of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway</hi>; from whence the <hi>English Saxon</hi> Kings might by Degrees impose it upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="cxx" facs="tcp:93814:64"/>
Lands by them granted to their Ealdormen or Earls, and chief <hi>Thanes,</hi> by Military or Knights Service, who likewise granted them to their inferiour <hi>Thanes</hi> under the like Tenures; and yet it would have been very unreasonable that such inferior <hi>Thanes</hi> should have so far been deprived of their antient <hi>English</hi> Freedom, as that the Earls and King's <hi>Thanes</hi> should have it in their Power to make what Laws, and impose what Taxes they pleased upon them as their under Tenants, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Consent.</p>
            <p>AND if meer Tenure alone could have done this, I would fain know why the <hi>English</hi> Kings before the Conquest, by the same reason might not as well have made Laws, and taxed their Tenants <hi>in Capite</hi> without their Consent, as these could have done their Tenants that held under them? But this is altogether false in Matter of Fact, as all the Histories of those Times shew; <hi>Danegelt</hi> it self being first imposed by the Consent of the King and his <hi>Wites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 994.</note> as appears by the <hi>Saxon Annals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOT but that I grant all the Lands of <hi>England</hi> were then held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der those three great Services called in Latin <hi>Trinoda Necessitas,</hi> viz. 1. Expedition (that is, the finding of Men to defend the Kingdom in case of Invasion.) 2. The Repair of Bridges; and, 3. Fortifying of Castles; from which even Lands granted to the Church were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted, as appears by the Charters to several Monasteries. But these were Services due, and to be performed by the Common Law and Custom of the Kingdom, and did not concern one sort of Tenure more than another.</p>
            <p>I have no more to observe concerning this <hi>Bocland,</hi> but that it passed by Deed,<note place="margin">Ingulph. Hist. fol. 508.</note> called by <hi>Ingulphus, Chirographa,</hi> until the <hi>Confessor</hi>'s time, and was confirmed by the Subscriptions of the <hi>Fideles,</hi> or Subjects there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, with golden Crosses, and some other holy Marks; only this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks ought not to be passed over, that the Ceremony of Livery or Seizin of Lands is very antient, as appears by the Charter of <hi>Ceadwalla,</hi> King of the <hi>West-Saxons</hi> (preserved among the Evidences belonging to the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) in the Year DCLXXXVII. made to <hi>Theodore</hi> then Arch-bishop of that See, of certain Lands with this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, <hi>Ad cumulum autèm Confirmationis, ego</hi> Cedwalla <hi>Cespitem terrae praedictae supèr sanctum Altare Salvatoris posui, &amp; propriâ manu, pro ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantia Literarum, signum sanctae Crucis expressi &amp; subscripsi:</hi> that is, <q>For the farther Confirmation thereof, I <hi>Ceadwalla</hi> have put this said Turf of Earth upon the holy Altar, and for want of Learning, have with my own Hand made and subscribed the Sign of the holy Cross.</q> The like also hath <hi>Camden</hi> out of a Patent made by <hi>Withered</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi>

            <p>BUT I desire by the way, that this may not be unobserved, that I can no where find the word <hi>Colonus</hi> used for a Husbandman or Clown, in any of our antient <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws,<note place="margin">Spelm.

            <p>HAVING now given you what I thought fit to say concerning the several Tenures, and ways of Conveyance of Lands in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Times, I shall proceed in the next place to discourse somewhat of the manner of the disposing of their Goods and Personal Estates, which they might do either by Deed or last Will in Writing, as at this day: But if they happened at any time to die intestate, then their Goods were equally divided between the Wife and Children of the Deceased; tho by a Law of King <hi>Edmund,</hi> the Relict, or Widow, was to have half her Husband's Goods, yet by the Laws of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that <hi>in case any one died Intestate, then the Children were equally to divide the Goods</hi>; which I take to be understood with a <hi>Salvo</hi> of the
<pb n="cxxii" facs="tcp:93814:65"/>
Wife's Dower or Portion. As yet therefore the Ordinaries had nothing to do with the Administration, for <hi>Goods</hi> passed by Descent as well as Lands, and upon this Custom the Writ <hi>de Rationabili parte Bonorum</hi> was grounded at the Common Law, as well for the Children as the Wife's Part,<note place="margin">F.N.B. <hi>p.</hi> 122.</note> according as by the Body of the Writ may appear.</p>
            <p>THE antientest Will that Mr. <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Selden</hi> says he hath observed before the Conquest, is, one of King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s time, which Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">Peramb.

By which it should seem the Lands bequeathed were <hi>Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> Lands (held by Knights Service) which could not be alienated without the Lord's Consent. But Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> there further takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, <q>That the Protection or Execution of this Testament, as well as the Probate, were within the Jurisdiction of the Lord's Court; and that especially because divers <hi>Lords of Mannors</hi> have to this day the Probate of Testaments by Custom continued, against that which is otherwise regularly settled in the Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT as for Intestates <hi>Goods,</hi> he says, <q>The Disposition or Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of them was in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times in the chief Lord of him that died,<note place="margin">Selden ut sup. fol. 15, 16. cap. 1.</note> in case the Intestate were an immediate Tenant, and died at home in Peace: But in case he were no Tenant, or died in his Lord's Army, then it was (it seems) as other Inheritance, under the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of that Temporal Court within whose Territory the Goods were. This may be proved out of the Laws of that Time, which ordain, that upon the Death of an Intestate, whom they call <hi>CWIALE AWE,</hi> the Lord <note n="*" place="margin">Canuti Leg. cap. 68.</note> is only to have the <hi>Heriots</hi> due to him, which are also appointed by <note n="†" place="margin">Ejusdem Leg. cap. 68.</note> the Laws of the same time, that <hi>by his</hi> (the Lord's) <hi>Advice or Judgment, his</hi> (the Intestate's) <hi>Goods be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided among his Wife and Children, and the next of kin, according as to every one of them of right belongs</hi>; that is, according to the nearness of Kindred, if no Children, or Nephews from them be: for it must, I suppose, be understood, that the Succession was such, that the Children excluded all their Kindred, and of their Kindred the next succeeded, according to that in <hi>Tacitus</hi>

               </q> Thus far this learned and great Author.</p>
            <p>FROM whence we may make this Note, that the Probate of Wills was a Matter of Civil Cognizance before the Conquest, and for some time after, till, the Canon Law being more generally received in <hi>England,</hi> the Bishops Courts took this Power to themselves, supposed by Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> in his 6<hi>th</hi> Chapter of his said Treatise, to be about the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Second.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE shall now, in the last place,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Criminal part of the English Saxon Laws.</hi>
               </note> go on to the <hi>Criminal</hi> part of the <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Laws, <hi>viz.</hi> the manner of Trial, Judgment and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pass'd and inflicted on Offenders in those Times.</p>
            <p>ALL Trials for Criminal Matters were then either in the <hi>Court-Leets,</hi> the <hi>Sheriffs-turn,</hi> or the <hi>County-Courts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>All Trials in Court-Leets, Sheriffs-turn, or County-Courts.</hi>
               </note> in which last the greater Offenders were commonly tried, and that most antiently by Witnesses and Juries, as at this day: for we find in the <hi>Mirror of Justices,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mirror,</hi> Cap. 5. Sect. 1.</note> that King <hi>Alfred</hi> commanded one of his Justices to be put to death for passing Sentence upon a <hi>Verdict</hi> corruptly obtained, upon the Votes of the <hi>Jurors,</hi> whereof three of the <hi>Twelve</hi> were in the Negative. And the same King put another of his Justices to death for passing Sentence of Death upon an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> return'd by the Jury.</p>
            <p>BUT the first Law we read of that defined the Number of <hi>Jury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> to be <hi>Twelve,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Number of Jury-men to be Twelve.</hi>
               </note> was that of <hi>Aetheldred</hi> I. above two hundred Years before the Conquest, which says, <hi>In singulis Centuriis,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>English</hi> thus, <hi>In every Century or Hundred, let there be a Court,</hi>
               <note place="margin">LL. Sax. Lamb.</note> 
               <hi>and let Twelve Antient Freemen, together with the Lord of the Hundred, be sworn that they will not condemn the Innocent, nor acquit the Guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT whether there were any such thing as a Grand Jury or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, we do not particularly find,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Grand Jury.</hi>
               </note> only we may reasonably conclude there was, because in the same <hi>Mirror</hi> we read that a Justice suffered Death for passing Sentence only upon the <hi>Coroner</hi>'s Record; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Justice had the same Punishment for condemning one without any preceding <hi>Appeal</hi> or <hi>Indictment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YET the first time that we find any mention of a Jury by Mens Peers or Equals, is in the Agreement between <hi>Alfred</hi> and <hi>Guthrune</hi> the Dane, in these words in <hi>English, viz.</hi> 
               <q>That if a Lord or a Baron be accused of Homicide, he shall be acquitted by twelve Lords;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>K.</hi> Alured. Concil. Brit. fol. 492.</note> but if of inferiour Rank, he shall be acquitted by eleven of his Equals, and one Lord.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT in Cases very doubtful, and where there was not sufficient Evidence by Witnesses, but only strong Presumptions of Guilt,<note place="margin">

               </note> in the times after King <hi>Alfred,</hi> Trials by <hi>Ordeal</hi> came in, which <hi>Somner</hi> in his Glossary says was derived from <hi>Or</hi> a Negative, or <hi>Privative,</hi> and <hi>Dal,</hi> which signifies <hi>Distinction,</hi> or <hi>Difference,</hi> that is, without any Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Difference, and imports a just, impartial Judgment: it was of two sorts, by <hi>Fire</hi> or <hi>Water</hi>; by <hi>Fire,</hi> when the Person accused carried in his bare Hand a red-hot Iron some few steps; which, if it weighed but one Pound, was called single <hi>Ordeal,</hi> and so double, or treble, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Pounds the Iron weighed: or when he walked <hi>bare-foot,</hi> and <hi>blindfold,</hi> over and between certain red-hot Plow-shares, placed at a stated distance; if in doing this the Party was burnt, he was pronounced
<pb n="cxxiv" facs="tcp:93814:66"/>
Guilty; if not, he was accounted Innocent. <hi>Water-Ordeal</hi> was either when they cast the accused into Water, and if they did swim, were adjudged Guilty; if they sunk, Innocent: or else their Hands and Arms were put sometimes up to the Wrist,<note place="margin">LL. Longob. lib. 1. tit. 9. c. 39. Glanv. lib. 14. cap. 1. in fine.</note> sometimes up to the Elbow in <hi>boiling-hot</hi> Water; if they were scalded, they were esteemed Guilty; if not, Innocent. The Noble and Freemen were tried by <hi>Fire-Ordeal,</hi> the Peasants and Servants by <hi>Water Ordeal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A great Example of the former you will find towards the latter end of the sixth Book,<note place="margin">Fol. 79.</note> concerning the putting of Queen <hi>Emma,</hi> Mother of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> to this <hi>Fire-Ordeal</hi> by Plow-shares, upon suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of <hi>Incontinency</hi> with <hi>Ailwyn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester:</hi> but indeed this Story is very improbable for several reasons; for first, the Crime she stood accused of could be no more than simple Fornication, which was then as well as now within the Cognizance of the Church, and for which no higher Punishment than the common Penance was inflicted. And further,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See the Hist.</hi> Anno 1042.</note> we find this Queen to have fallen into the King's Displeasure in the first or second Year of his Reign, and being not long after restored to his Favour, we do not read she was ever after questioned: and as for <hi>Robert,</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who is said to have been one of her chief Prosecutors, it is certain he was not consecrated to that See till about seven or eight Years after. Besides all which, Bishop <note n="*" place="margin">De Praesul. <hi>p.</hi> 89, 90.</note> 
               <hi>Godwin</hi> in his Account of this Arch-bishop, further proves from <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> that Bishop <hi>Ailwin</hi> was dead <hi>Anno</hi> 1047, a Year before ever <hi>Robert</hi> was made Arch-bishop; and therefore this learned Author does wholly deny the reality of this Story. But to return again to our <hi>Ordeal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE first mention made thereof as we meet with, was at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and afterwards in the Council of <hi>Triers</hi>; but we have no Foot-step thereof in our <hi>English</hi> Laws, till it was brought into this Nation by the Council of <hi>Berkhamstead,</hi> under <hi>Bertwald</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury, Anno</hi> 647; and it after became inserted into those of King <hi>Athelstan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">LL. Aethelst. Can. 23.</note> tho it was certainly in use before that time.</p>
            <p>I have little more to add concerning this way of Trial by <hi>Ordeal,</hi> but that it was under the Government of the Clergy, who never permitted it to be put in Execution but when they were present. And sometimes it was performed with the great Solemnity of receiving the <hi>Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,</hi> especially if the suspected Person was of their Order and Function; and if the Party was cast, he was to suffer as Guilty.</p>
            <p>THIS way of Trial by <hi>Ordeal</hi> continued long after the Conquest, but at last it was forbid by the Pope's Decree; and we have now no Remainders of it left, unless it be in the Country Peoples trying of Witches, who being tied with their Thumbs and Toes together, and so flung into the Water, if they sink, are accounted Innocent; if they swim, Guilty: but indeed if this <hi>Ordeal,</hi> either by Fire or Water, was performed by the help of the Devil, one would wonder it should ever be introduced, especially with such solemn Prayers and Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as you may find in <hi>Lambard</hi>'s Explications of <hi>Law-terms,</hi> and in <hi>Matthew Parker</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> his <hi>Antiquities of the British Church.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vita Roberti Archiep.</note> And on the other side, if it was assisted by a Divine Power, it is as wonderful how it came to be forbid by the Pope, as wholly unlawful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="cxxv" facs="tcp:93814:66"/>BUT besides these ways of Trial abovementioned, upon more slight Suspicions, our <hi>English Saxon</hi> Ancestors were used to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with a <hi>Voyer dire,</hi> or the Oath of the Party suspected, and the concurring Testimony of other Men; the first attesting his own Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, the other attesting their own Consciences for the Truth of the former Testimony; and therefore were, and still are called <hi>Compurgators.</hi> Their number was more or less, and of greater or less Value, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Offence, or the Party suspected was of greater or less Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.</p>
            <p>AND as for the way of Trial by <hi>single Combat</hi> or <hi>Duel,</hi> tho some Writers suppose it to have been in use before the Conquest, yet since I meet with no mention of it either in our Historians or Laws, I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer discoursing of it till I come to the next Volume.</p>
            <p>HAVING now dispatched this Head concerning Trials, I'll proceed to the Judgments and Penalties that were inflicted on Persons for several Offences. And first I shall consider those against Almighty God, as Sacrilege,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sacrilege.</hi>
               </note> which you will find upon the first introducing of Christianity to have been appointed by the Pope, as also by the Laws of King <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> either in making satisfaction of nine times the Value, or in case of Inability, to pay that Sum in Stripes; for not then, nor long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was it punishable with Death:<note place="margin">De Gestis Pontificum, l. 1.</note> for <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> tells us, that <hi>Theodered,</hi> the good Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan,</hi> fell short of one thing, <hi>viz.</hi> That he caused certain Thieves to be hanged, who had robbed St. <hi>Edmunds</hi> Church in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and were there held by some invisible Power, insomuch that they could not go away with what they had stolen, but were all taken and executed accordingly; for which piece of Severity he was much blamed.</p>
            <p>THE next Offence was <hi>Working upon Sundays,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sabaoth-breaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </note> which by the Laws of King <hi>Ina,</hi> was punishable by <hi>Fine,</hi> if the Criminal were a <hi>Freeman</hi>; and by <hi>Whipping</hi> if he were a <hi>Bond-Servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT as for <hi>Blasphemy, Cursing</hi> or <hi>Swearing,</hi> either they were Crimes the <hi>Saxons</hi> were not guilty of, or else they inflicted no Punishments on those who were culpable of them; for I find no mention of them in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws.</p>
            <p>AS for the Offences against both God and Man, I will first begin with <hi>Adultery</hi> and <hi>Fornication,</hi> and these were Capital amongst the <hi>Saxons:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Adultery and Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
               </note> for by the Laws of <hi>Withred</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> if a Military Man should (after that Council was ended, despising the King's Law, and the Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sentence of the Bishop's Excommunication) be taken in Adultery, he should pay to his Lord an hundred Shillings. <q>But afterwards by the Laws of King <hi>Cnute,</hi> a Wife found guilty of Adultery, should have her Nose and Ears cut off, and the Man was Fined or Banished: and by those of King <hi>Alfred,</hi> the Man convicted of Adultery with another's Wife, should pay to the Husband so abused, a Fine sutable to the Estate and Quality of him that was so injured.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE highest Offence against Man alone was Treason,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Treason.</hi>
               </note> and the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for this Offence I find set down in the 4<hi>th</hi> Law of K. <hi>Alfred</hi> to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That if any one by himself, or any other Person should attempt against the King's Life, he should lose his Life and Goods; or in case he will purge himself, he was to do it according to the Valuation of the King's Head.</q> But in this the King had no greater a Prerogative
<pb n="cxxvi" facs="tcp:93814:67"/>
than divers other of his Subjects; for the same Law doth inform us, <q>That it ordained in all Judgments concerning other Men, whether Noble or Ignoble, whosoever should Conspire against his Lord, should lose both his Life and Estate, or else pay the Valuation of his Lord's Head.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Coining and Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</hi>
               </note>I come next to the <hi>Coining</hi> and <hi>Clipping</hi> of Money, which was not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally such an Offence as was punish'd by Death; for the first Law that made it so was that of <hi>Ethelred,</hi> whereby it is left to the King's discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either to fine, or put to Death such Merchants as imported false Money; and all <hi>Port-Reeves</hi> of Towns who should be Accessary to it were made liable to the same: but for all this it was not even after the Conquest punishable by Death, but amputation of the Right Hand and Privy-Members.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Murder.</hi>
               </note>AS for <hi>Murder,</hi> or killing a Man with Malice prepensed, it was by the Preface to King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Laws punishable by Death: And this and the former Law concerning <hi>Treason,</hi> will help us to interpret in what Cases the <hi>Wiregilds</hi> or <hi>Mulcts,</hi> that we find so frequently mentioned in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws, were to be paid for the Life of a Man, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Law of King <hi>Athelstan,</hi> which sets the Rate of these <hi>Wiregilds</hi> according to the Quality of the Person slain, from the King to the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant; that is, when the Party was Killed in some sudden Fray or Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel without any Malice forethought.</p>
            <p>THIS I take notice of, to obviate the Error of some who suppose, that all Murder, even of the King himself, was redeemable by Money, which was not allowed in any Cases but those we account Man-slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at this Day;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Manslaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
               </note> and shews the Antiquity of that distinction between Man-slaughter and Murder, which is now almost peculiar to <hi>England,</hi> and arose at first from the Proneness of our Nation to Fewds and sudden Quarrels; tho the like Custom is also to be found in the Antient <hi>Frisian</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Laws, if you will take the Pains to consult them. But as for Bloodshed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Maiming,</hi> &amp;c.</note> Striking, Maiming, Wounding, Dismembring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they were all of them punishable by Mulcts or Fines, as you will see in the Laws of King <hi>Alfred,</hi> and other Places in this Volume.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Robbery and Burglary.</hi>
               </note>I proceed in the next Place to Robbery and Burglary, which by the Laws of King <hi>Ina,</hi> were punishable by Death; only the Thief was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mmitted sometimes to redeem it according to the Estimation of his Head, and that I suppose was left to the discretion of the Judg, either to deny or allow. But for all other less Thefts, they were redeemable by Fines. And the Laws of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> limited that Punishment of Death to Thefts of twelve Pence in value, or above.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Trespasses.</hi>
               </note>AND Trespasses of a less Nature upon Lands and Goods, were to be punished by the Criminal's making Satisfaction to the injured Party, and his paying a certain Fine besides to the King; which by King <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi>'s Law was set at five Shillings; and in his Time other Actions were likewise used,<note place="margin">Cap. 30.</note> such as we call <hi>Actions upon the Case</hi>; and the Plaintiff not only recovered <hi>Damages</hi> for Trespasses done to Possessions and Goods, but also <hi>Costs</hi> for Injuries in Point of Scandal and Defamation, in case the Complainant specially declare that he was thereby disabled, or inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his Preferment, and made Proof of the same, much like to the Forms of our Pleadings now.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Perjury.</hi>
               </note>AS for <hi>Perjury</hi> which I have hitherto omitted, tho in strict Method it should have been mentioned before, as a Sin against both God and Man,
<pb n="cxxvii" facs="tcp:93814:67"/>
the <hi>Saxons</hi> were utterly Enemies to it, and punished it with perpetual discredit of their Testimony, and sometimes with Banishment, or with grievous <hi>Fines</hi> to the King, and <hi>Mulcts</hi> to the Judg. For that difference I find observed in those Days between <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Mulcts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">LL. <hi>Aethelst.</hi> Cap. 12. LL. <hi>Canuti,</hi> c. 5. Spec. Sax. l. 3. Art. 53. LL. <hi>Edw.</hi> c. 18.</note> tho the more Antient Times used them for one and the same; for I often find <hi>pars Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ctae Regi.</hi> In all these Matters where any Interest was vested in the Crown, the King had the Prerogative of Pardon, yet always a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence was saved to the injured Party; besides the Security of the Good-behaviour for Time to come, as the case required.</p>
            <p>THESE <hi>Mulcts</hi> for all these <hi>Offences</hi> were set down in a Book, which was the Rule and Standard of the Judge's Sentence. And it is called in the Preface to the Laws of King <hi>Edward,</hi> the <hi>Doom</hi> or <hi>Judgment-Book</hi>; and Composition was to be made, and Satisfaction given, according to what was laid in this <hi>Judicial</hi> or <hi>Doom-Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS shews that Fines were then set out and appointed by Law,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fines set and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Law.</hi>
               </note> and were proportioned not only according to Mens Offences, but Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of what they were able to pay; and were not in those Times left to the Arbitrary Wills and Humours of the Judg, to ruin Mens Fortunes and Families, and imprison their Persons during Life, perhaps only for a small Offence in a rash Word, or unmalicious Deed.</p>
            <p>I confess this Introduction is longer than I first intended it, but herein I hope the Reader will excuse me, since I have presented him with a true Scheme of the Antient <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Government and Laws, as well Ecclesiastical as Civil, relating to the just Prerogatives of the King, as also to the true Rights and Liberties of the People: and this I have done for two Ends; first, to inform those of our own Nation as well as Strangers, that this Government before the pretended Conquest, agreed in the most material parts of it with those of the same <hi>Gothick</hi> Model all over <hi>Europe</hi>; and that if we do still labour to preserve our Antient Constitution, when most of our Neighbours have either lost or given up theirs, I think we do deserve Commendation, more especially since both Prince and People may have found an equal Interest and Happiness in it.</p>
            <p>AND secondly, to shew, that neither the <hi>Danish</hi> nor <hi>Norman</hi> Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, (called by some <hi>Conquests</hi>) have at all altered it in any of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial parts of our Government or Laws, notwithstanding what some Men have so strenuously advanced to the contrary, out of what designs they themselves best know.</p>
            <p>AS for what I have here laid down, if any thing appears either new, or of suspicious Credit, I desire to be no farther believed, than the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Authorities I have here produced will justify me; and therefore shall leave the Reader to make what Judgment he pleases of it, which if it doth not suit with mine, I shall not take it amiss, since I am suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently sensible how much Mens Opinions depend on their present In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, Education, or Course of Life: and I cannot but observe, that there are a sort of Men, whose Heads seem framed for such a set of Notions rather than others, which make them that they cannot easily digest any thing that clashes with them.</p>
            <p>BUT I do not pretend to be infallible, or to propose my sense as a Rule and Standard to all others; <hi>Homo sum, nihil humanum à me alienum puto,</hi> as the Comick Poet hath long since well observed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="cxxviii" facs="tcp:93814:68"/>ONE thing indeed I think I may pretend to in this Undertaking, and that is <hi>Integrity</hi>; for I look upon it a much viler thing, either to falsify, or conceal part of an Authority that makes against one, and use only so much as shall serve a present Turn, that it is to <hi>pick a Pocket:</hi> and as it is of far more dangerous Consequence to the Publick, if not found out; I must say it is likewise more easily to be discovered, since every Man may, if he please, consult the Authors that such Writers make use of, and so detect the Fraud.</p>
            <p>BUT for those who think they may differ from me in some things with good Reason and Authority, and will please by their learned La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to give the World any better Information and Account of these Matters than I have done; I shall be so far from being displeased at them, that I shall upon full Satisfaction, readily own my self very much in their Debt, for making the World and me so much the Wiser: only I must desire to be treated as one, who, if I chance to be under any Error, am not so wilfully, nor (as I think) without great appearance of Reason and Authority on my side; since I call God to witness, that neither from a vain Ambition of Glory, nor prospect of any Temporal Advantage, nor design of gratifying any Party or Faction, have I wrote any thing that may disgust Men of different Principles and Notions.</p>
            <p>AND I thank God for this great Blessing to us, that we live in a Time, when we may not only think or speak, but also safely write what we believe to be the Truth, to which all Mankind do owe Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance; and therefore I hope I never shall abuse that invaluable Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to the Prejudice of the Government, or that excellent constituted Church, of which I own my self a Member, being fully satisfied that the main End of all our Writings, ought to be for the Honour of God, and the Common Good of Mankind.</p>

with which Success the King and his Men growing insolent and secure, spent the Night following in Luxury and Drinking, without keeping any Guard, or observing Military Discipline; of which the Enemies (who it seems fled not far) gaining Intelligence, and laying hold of this Opportunity, set upon them about Midnight, and slew near 20000 <hi>Scots,</hi> being then (as it were) buried in Wine and Sleep; King <hi>Donald</hi> himself being also taken Prisoner, and to purchase his Liberty, was forced to give up all the Countries lying between the River <hi>Cluyde</hi> and <hi>Sterling</hi> to the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> and farther obliged himself and his Successors to the Annual Payment of a Sum of Money in Name of a Tribute: and that then in the sixth Year of his unhappy Reign the <hi>English-Saxons,</hi> in Memory of this Victory, rebuilt the ruined Castle of <hi>Sterling,</hi> and fortified the Bridg of <hi>Forth,</hi> where they erected a Cross of Stone as a Monument of their Victory, on which were engraven these barbarous Latine Verses.</p>

into two; for the King was not willing to bestow so great a Part of the Kingdom on any as an Inheritance, lest the <hi>Northumbers</hi> should again aspire to their antient Liberty; wherefore he bestowed that Part of <hi>Northumberland</hi> lying between the <hi>Humber</hi> and the <hi>Theys</hi> upon Earl <hi>Oslac,</hi> girding him with the Sword of that Earldom: But from <hi>Theys</hi> to <hi>Mireferth</hi> being the Sea-coast of <hi>Deira,</hi> he bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earl <hi>Eadulf,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Ethelwald</hi>; and thus the two Kingdoms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came two Earldoms, and so continued all the times of the <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Kings under their Gift and Jurisdiction; whilst <hi>Lothian</hi> lying open to the Incursions of the <hi>Scots</hi> was of no great concern to our Kings.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Britain,</hi> the largest of all the <hi>Europaean</hi> Islands, (and one of the biggest in this Habitable Globe,) is scituate between 50 Degrees 16 Minutes, and 59 Degrees 30 Minutes North Latitude, the whole Isle lying in length from <hi>Dunsby-Head,</hi> the most Northerly Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to <hi>Dover,</hi> the space of near Six hundred Miles; yet is the Climate more mild and temperate than could be expected in so Northerly a Scituation; the Winds from the Seas encompassing it on all sides, so tempering the Air, that it is neither so cold in Winter, nor yet so hot in Summer, as the opposite Continents of <hi>France, Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries</hi>; and also by the Indulgence of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as well as the Fertility of its Native Soil, it is plentifully fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with all Things necessary for Human Life.</p>
            <p>It was anciently called by the Greeks <hi>Albion,</hi> but whether from a Giant of that Name feigned to be the Son of <hi>Neptune,</hi> after the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93814:73"/>
Fabulous Humour of those Times, in giving Names to Countries from Giants and Heroes; or else from the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Festus</hi> signifies <hi>White</hi>; since, this Island is on many sides of it encompassed with Rocks of that Colour; or else from the Phoenician word <hi>Alp,</hi> which signifies <hi>High</hi>; or from <hi>Alben,</hi> which in the Hebrew Tongue signifies <hi>White,</hi> is uncertain, and therefore needless to be insisted on too much.</p>
            <p>As for the Name of <hi>Britain,</hi> which <hi>Nennius</hi> and divers other British Writers derive from <hi>Brutus,</hi> (whom they likewise call <hi>Brito</hi>;) but others of them from the British words <hi>Pryd Cain,</hi> i. e. <hi>Forma candida,</hi> a white Form; it seems too far fetch'd; and besides, we do not find that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of this Isle ever called it <hi>Britain.</hi>

                  <hi>Introduct. to</hi> Britan.</note>Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> derives it from the Welsh word <hi>Brith,</hi> which signifies <hi>Painted,</hi> (for the ancient <hi>Britains</hi> used to paint themselves of a pale blewish Colour with <hi>Glastum,</hi> or <hi>Woad</hi>;) and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which in Greek signifies a <hi>Region,</hi> or <hi>Country.</hi> But this Etymology has this Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience in it, that it is derived from too far different Languages; and besides it seems very improbable, that such an Accidental Custom as that of painting their Bodies, should give a Name to the whole Island, as well as its Inhabitants. Nor does this word, <hi>Brith,</hi> signifie in the Welsh Tongue, <hi>Painted,</hi> but rather <hi>Spotted</hi> with divers Colours; whereas the ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> as some write, did not paint themselves with various Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, but only stained their Bodies with one simple Colour, <hi>viz.</hi> Blue. We must therefore endeavour to derive it from some other Language, if it was not the <hi>Britains</hi> themselves, but other Nations (as is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable) that first called this Island <hi>Britain.</hi> Now it is certain, that there is no Word in the Greek Tongue from whence <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Yet notwithstanding the Care of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> to conceal these Islands, the <hi>Greeks</hi> did at last discover them, (thô we cannot tell the certain time when,) giving them the Name of <hi>Cassiterides,</hi> which signifies in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, the same that <hi>Barat-Anac</hi> does in the <hi>Phoenician,</hi> viz. <hi>The Land</hi> or <hi>Country of Tin</hi>; which Name; thô given only to these Islands at first, was at last also communicated to the adjoyning Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, now called <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devonshire</hi>; from whence also the <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians</hi> might bring this Commodity; and so by degrees this Name came to be given to all those Islands thus lying together; since in those Times (as well as now) it is probable, there might be Mines of this Metal in <hi>Britain</hi> itself, as well as in those smaller Islands above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: In some of which Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> tells us, there are found Veins of this Metal even unto this Day; and there might be far greater Mines of it in former Ages, thô long since worn out.</p>
            <p>But it is Objected, That Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> in his Introduction to his <hi>Britannia,</hi> hath positively asserted, that <hi>Britain</hi> was not known to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and therefore its Name could not be derived from them, or the <hi>Phoenicians</hi>: and for Proof of this, he cites a Place out of the Third Book of <hi>Polybius</hi>'s History, which we shall here render into English thus. <q>As for <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Lybia,</hi> where they joyn to each other about <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> none can say positively to this Day, whether it be a Continent running to the South, or whether it be encompassed by the Sea. So likewise what lies between <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais</hi> and <hi>Narbon,</hi> stretching Northward, is unknown to us at this present, unless hereafter by diligent Enquiry we may learn some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it; they that speak or write any thing of these Matters, are to be thought to know nothing, and to lay down meer Fables.]</q> By which Words <hi>Polybius</hi> only means, That as it was doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sea encompassed the South Parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> so it was unknown whether the North Parts of <hi>Europe</hi> about <hi>Narbon</hi> were likewise so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed; whereas Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> understands the Words as if they were spoken in general, when indeed they related only to that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Question, Whether the Northern Tracts of <hi>Europe</hi> were invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with the Sea or not, which notwithstanding the great Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Navigation stands unresolv'd even unto this Day. But that <hi>Polybius</hi> writ not in this sense, appears further, in that he himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes the Fountains of <hi>Rhodanus</hi> and <hi>Ligeris,</hi> with many other Places of <hi>Gaul</hi> which lie all above <hi>Narbon.</hi> But to put this past all Dispute, in this very Third Book, <hi>he promises particularly to write of the further or Western Sea, as also of the Britanick Islands,</hi> (for so he calls them,) <hi>and of their manner of making Tin</hi>: Which Promise of his required more than a Cursory Knowledge to perform: Since he says, <hi>That the Trade into those Seas was then very great</hi>; now that he also performed this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, appears from <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Greeks</hi> long before <hi>Polybius</hi>'s time, appears also from <hi>Herodotus,</hi> who confesses, <hi>he does not know the Islands</hi> Cassiterides, <hi>from whence Tin, is brought</hi>; (that is, he did not know them any otherwise than by Report;) and if these smaller Islands were then discovered, can any one believe, that so great an Island as <hi>Britain,</hi> which lay so near them, could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main undiscovered?

            <p>I shall therefore now proceed to somewhat more Solid and Useful, and try if we can discover who were the first Inhabitants of this Island; but since the Scriptures, as well as Prophane Histories, are silent in this Point, it is impossible to tell the Name of the Man who brought the first Colony hither; Only thus much seems probable, That <hi>Europe</hi> was Peopled by the Posterity of <hi>Jophet,</hi> either from one <hi>Alanus,</hi> (whom <hi>Nenniu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which may be also proved from other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, as their Affinity in Customs, Language and Religion, with those of <hi>Gaul,</hi> as they are there described by <hi>Caesar,</hi> and also by other <hi>Roman</hi> Authors: Thô <hi>Tacitus,</hi> in his Life of <hi>Agricola,</hi> does not wholly agree with <hi>Caesar</hi> as to this Particular, for he there tells us, <q>That the Northern Parts of <hi>Britain</hi> seem to have been Peopled by the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> as the Eastern Coasts by their opposite Neighbours the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and the South Part by the <hi>Iberi</hi> or <hi>Spaniards</hi>: This he gathers from the different Complexion of the People, the Northern <hi>Britains</hi> (says he) are Fair, having large Limbs, and long yellow Hair like the <hi>Germans</hi>; but the <hi>Silures,</hi> or Southern <hi>Britains,</hi> were Swarthy, and had curled Hair like the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whereas the Coast lying over-against <hi>Gaul</hi> agreed in Language, Customs, and in every thing else with the <hi>Gauls.</hi>

            <p>It was not from the Continent of <hi>Gaul</hi> alone, that this Island was first Inhabited, but also from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the North Parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> or else from <hi>Scandinavia,</hi> now called <hi>Sweden</hi>; for <hi>Bede</hi> tells us in the First Chapter of his History, <q>That, after the <hi>Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>That as yet,</hi> that is, in his time, <hi>almost half</hi> Scotland <hi>spoke the</hi> Irish <hi>Tongue, which they had brought over with them from</hi> Ireland.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To return to the matter in hand it is evident from <hi>Bede,</hi> that in his time, <hi>God</hi> was served in five several Languages in this Island, (<hi>viz</hi>) The <hi>English,</hi> the <hi>British,</hi> the <hi>Scotish,</hi> (or present <hi>Irish</hi>) the <hi>Latin</hi> (which they commonly used in Divine Service) and the <hi>Pictish</hi>; though what that Language was we cannot now tell; for the <hi>Picts</hi> being totally subdued by the <hi>Scots,</hi> and thereby incorporated into the body of that Nation, that Tongue is quite extinct; though if it had not been at least different in Dialect from that of the <hi>Britains,</hi> it seems improbable that <hi>Bede,</hi> who was so near a neighbour to them, should mention it as a distinct Tongue from all the rest. And yet notwithstanding by all the relicts we can now find of it in the Names of places in the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>West</hi> parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they are purely <hi>British,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> hath learnedly proved in his said In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction, and therefore, since the name of <hi>Pict</hi> is indeed <hi>Latin,</hi> and signifies no more than painted Men, and that no <hi>Roman</hi> Author makes mention of them, before <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> who lived about the end of the fourth Century, and is the first who calls the Inhabitants of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> parts of <hi>Britain</hi> by the name of <hi>Picti,</hi> distinguishing them into <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calidonii</hi> (perhaps, it should be <hi>Deucaldonii</hi>) and <hi>Vecturiones,</hi> which the learned Dr. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> late Lord Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> and now of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Litchfield,</hi> in his Historical account of Church Goverment in <hi>Britain,</hi> probably enough derives from the <hi>British Deucilyddion,</hi> and <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Britains,</hi> who preserved their Liberty by resisting the <hi>Roman</hi> Arms, and were at last divided from the <hi>Roman Britains,</hi> by a Wall, now called the <hi>Picts</hi> Wall, (the Vestiges of which are to be seen to this Day) drawn between the mouths of the Rivers <hi>Tine</hi> and <hi>Eske,</hi> to hinder their farther Incursions into those parts which were then under the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>But having said enough concerning this <hi>Island</hi> in general, together with its first Inhabitants and their Languages; It is now high time to come to our main design, the History of that part of it, called at this day <hi>England,</hi> and which was in the <hi>Romans</hi> time divided into several Provinces or Governments, as <hi>Britannia Prima, Secunda,</hi> and <hi>Maxima Caesariensis, &amp;c.</hi> they may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <q>We must therefore in the first place ingenuously confess, that till the coming in of the <hi>Romans,</hi> there are no certain or Authentick Histories remaining of any transactions before that time; for <hi>Gildas,</hi> who liv'd not long after the <hi>Saxons</hi> were first call'd into <hi>Britain,</hi> freely owns, <hi>that as for</hi> the <hi>Antient monuments</hi> of his Country, (whatever they were) being either burnt by Enemies, or carried beyond Sea by his banish'd <hi>Country men, they were not then to be found,</hi> therefore I shall wholly omit that fabulous Succession of <hi>Celtick</hi> Kings, who are feigned to be derived from <hi>Samothes,</hi> one of the Sons of <hi>Japhet,</hi> whom they suppose to have planted Colonies first on the Continent of <hi>Celtica</hi> or <hi>Gaul,</hi> and next in this <hi>Island,</hi> and thence to have named it <hi>Samothea,</hi> since they never had any existence, but in the brain of <hi>Amnius de Viterbo,</hi> and by him vented in his counterfeit <hi>Berosus,</hi> which is long since exploded by all that are any thing versed in Antiquity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But now I could heartily wish that we had any certain monuments of the History of this Kingdom, which might justly supply their room; but having no Authentick accounts left us of the <hi>British</hi> Kings, that reigned in this Island till <hi>Julius Caesar</hi>'s first Expedition hither, I could willingly have excused my self from the drudgery of writing things so uncertain, nay in diverse particulars utterly false, were it not that most Authors who have already writ our History either in <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi> have thought those long Successions of Kings not unworthy a particular Recital, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it scarce possible, that a descent of above Sixty Kings together, with so many transactions attended with such particular Circumstances, as the making of War and Peace, building of Cities and enacting Laws, should be wholly Fabulous and Romantick, or that the names of so many successive Princes should never have been derived from any real Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p>For though it is true that <hi>Geoffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> is look'd upon as the chief (if not only) Author of the Story of <hi>Brutus</hi> and his Successours; yet it is certain that he pretends in the Proem to his History, (which he dedicated to no less a Man than <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> natural Son to K. <hi>Hen. the I.</hi>) that he received an antient <hi>British</hi> History from <hi>Walter,</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Oxon,</hi> which (as he says) he faithfully translated out of the <hi>British</hi> Tongue into <hi>Latin,</hi> though <hi>William Neobrigensis,</hi> (who lived some time after this <hi>Geoffrey</hi>) in the very beginning of his History writes thus of him, <q>

But after him <hi>Henry</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Huntington,</hi> an Author of Credit (who lived at the same time with <hi>Geoffrey</hi>) ascribes the first habitation of this Island to <hi>Brutus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Sylvius,</hi> Grandson to <hi>Aeneas</hi>: whom together with his certain <hi>Trojans</hi> he supposes to have come into <hi>Britain</hi> in the third Age of the World, as the <hi>Scots</hi> did in the fourth into <hi>Ireland,</hi> which he seems to have taken out of <hi>Nennius,</hi> or some other ancient Author: But this must still be confest, that the whole relation of the Actions of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and the Succession of all the Princes that followed him, do all depend upon the Credit of <hi>Geoffrey</hi> and the truth of his tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>saction, and so was looked upon in the Age in which he published his History: But to make this <hi>Brute</hi> to be a <hi>Trojan,</hi> and to give him a <hi>Genealogy,</hi> which is plainly contradicted by all the <hi>Roman</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, is that for which his History ought to be condemned: Yet thus much may be said in Excuse of him, and of all those Authors who have ascribed the Origine of the <hi>Britains</hi> to <hi>Brute,</hi> that they have imitated the Vanity of the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> who derived their Kings from some <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Heroe.</hi> And have been followed in it not only by the <hi>Britains,</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> and almost all other Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> since they began to write Histories of their Originals.</p>
            <p>But since it is fit that we should give you some account (though as short as possible) of this <hi>Brute</hi> and his Successors, I shall contract their History from <hi>Geoffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> into as narrow a Compass as I can.</p>

               <hi>Archigallo</hi> being thus Restored, by his wise and sober Deportment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained the Affections of his People; for he discarded his former Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,

            <p>I shall not here trouble my self to set down, much less to confute the Errors that may be found in the Chronology of these Kings Reigns, since <hi>Geoffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> from whom they are taken, hath bin so cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, as not to give us any account in what Year of the World they Reign'd; sometimes telling us (tho' with no certainty at all) the Names of the Judges and Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> whom he makes Contemporary with them. But as for his last Nine and Twenty Kings from <hi>Elidure</hi> to <hi>Lud,</hi> he has given us nothing but their bare Names, without so much as setting down how many Years they reign'd, as if he himself, or those Authors he had Translated had bin ashamed, or weary of their own tedious Stories, and so would make it as short as they could.</p>
            <p>But as for <hi>Mat.</hi> of <hi>Westminster, Ponticus Virunnius, Polydore Virgil,</hi> and one <hi>Richard White,</hi> (who calls himself <hi>Basinstoke</hi>) I do not think it worth while to put down their pretended Corrections, Emendations, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s History, since, if he had no Authority to invent, I am sure they can less pretend to Correct his Inventions, or alter his Course of Succession of the <hi>British</hi> Kings, as <hi>Polydore</hi> has done, under pretence of making them more suitable to his own Accounts of time: But <hi>White</hi> has exceeded all others in this, making bold with <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> not on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y altering the Names of his Kings and their Course of Succession in many Places, but also referring them in particular to the Years of the World, in which he supposes them to have Reigned, adding also the Years of their Reigns where-ever he thought <hi>Geoffrey</hi> to be deficient, but without vouchsafing to give us the Names of any Authors from whence he took them: So that since we have indeed no better Authorities than <hi>Geoffrey</hi> himself, I shall not go about to Confute the Faults that might be found in the Chronology which Mr. <hi>White</hi> has given us of these Kings Reigns; though it were no hard Matter to shew diverse Absurdities in it. But this much is evident from the disagreement of these Authors, about the Names of their Kings and the Years of their Reigns, that they had nothing but their own Fancies to rely upon, for what they wrote; whence proceeds so great a Confusion in this part of their <hi>British</hi> History, that no Body can certainly conclude any thing from hence, unless that they were all mistaken: Nor is it only the uncertainty of Kings Names and Successions that we here find fault with, but the great Improbability (I might say Impossibility) of divers Matters of Fact related by <hi>Geoffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> in this History of the <hi>British</hi> Kings: As for Instance, that of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93814:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
King <hi>Ebrane</hi>'s sending his Thirty Daughters to find Husbands in <hi>Italy</hi>; which Story plainly took its rise from the <hi>Sabines</hi> denying their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to those People, which <hi>Romulus</hi> many Years after got together. Not to mention the Story of <hi>Morindus</hi>'s being devoured by a Sea-Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, whereas neither our Seas nor Rivers do now (or ever did) afford any such noxious Creatures; divers other more improbable Relations (because I would not tire the Reader with such Fooleries) I have here omitted. Besides all which, the very Names of many of these Kings, such as <hi>Jaco,</hi> (which is the same with <hi>James</hi> in English) <hi>Molmutius, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindus,</hi> as also <hi>Archigallo, Gorbonian, Ennianus, Geruntius, Fulgentius, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drogeus, Archimalus, Rodianus,</hi> sufficiently betray some a Phoenician, some a Grecian, and some a Roman Original, and could never be derived from the British O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iginals.</p>
            <p>Lastly, There is great difference between this part of the <hi>British</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story (especially from <hi>Elidure</hi> to <hi>Lud</hi>) and all other Histories; for whereas these commonly are barren of particular Transactions in their beginning, and afterwards enlarge themselves still more and more the further they proceed. This History is quite contrary, and the farther we go, the more confused we find the Succession of their Kings, and the less there is Recorded of their Actions; for from <hi>Elidure</hi> to <hi>Lud</hi> there are Nine and Twenty Kings, of whom nothing almost is Recorded but their bare Names; and which is also very remarkable, from this <hi>Elidure, Geoffrey</hi> makes no mention of the Years of their Reigns. What we find of this kind hath been added by those that writ long after him, who have done it very preposterously, allowing not above Ten Years one with another to Thirty Kings, which are supposed to have Reign'd in about Two Hundred Years; so that if there were any Truth in this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, it seems more rational to believe these Kings not to have succeeded each other, but many of them to have bin Contemporary Rulers of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Provinces of this Island.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore conclude this Part of the History with Mr. <hi>Milton</hi>'s Words concerning these Kings. <q>Thus far have we gone relying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Credit of <hi>Geoffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and his Assertors, though, for the Reasons above-mentioned, I have not thought it beside my Purpose to relate what I have found, whereto I neither oblige the Belief of other Persons, nor shall over-hastily subscribe my own.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Yet granting these things not to have been true, but invented by the Author above-mentioned; yet since even Romances, as well as true Histories, may furnish us with Observations sufficient to Instruct us, not only in the Humours and Passions of Mankind, but also in the Causes as well as Effects of human Actions: And since Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Lust, and the Desire of Revenge are commonly in their turns the Motives that incite Princes as well as private Men to Transgress the Laws of Reason; let us look back and survey some of the most remarkable Actions of those Princes, whose History we have here cited.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From those frequent Divisions we here read to have been made of the Kingdom between several Brothers, we may learn, that the <hi>Britains</hi> had no Notion of any Right in the Eldest Brother to Command over all the Rest, no not after they became Christians; the Welch Princes still dividing their Territories among all their Sons alike, though we may see the Inconvenience of this Course, by their making War upon each
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93814:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other about their particular Shares: Whence we may conclude, that Sovereignty ought to be left undivided, and the more Shares there are in it, the more Causes there are of Civil Wars and Divisions; nor have any prov'd more fatal than those among Brothers, of which we have sufficient Examples, not only in this, but other Histories.</p>
            <p>From so many Kings being depos'd for their Tyranny, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that the ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> though under a Monarchy, yet did not think themselves oblig'd to suffer their Kings, by becoming Tyrants, to make their People Slaves; but knew how to cast off that Yoke when it grew insupportable.</p>
            <p>Lastly, from <hi>Cassibelan</hi>'s being made a King by the People, for his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Worth, it plainly appears, that if the Kingdom were then He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary; yet the Estates did then reserve a Power to themselves, during the Minority of the Right Heir, to place in the Throne that Prince of the Blood-Royal, who was like to prove most able to defend them either against Foreign or Domestick Enemies; as this Prince in the War with <hi>Caesar</hi> evidenced to the World. I have made bold to add these few political Observations, that the Reader as well as my self may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit somewhat by Reading a History otherwise so dry and uninstructive.</p>

So that this (as I suppose) hath bin the Reason why some of our late <hi>English</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians, for want of other Matter, have stuffed out their Histories, not only with what the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors did in <hi>Gaul,</hi> or <hi>Britain,</hi> but all the other Parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, where they had occasion to make Wars; which is indeed rather to give a General History of the then known World, than of one single Island or Province.</p>
            <p>But since I intend to confine my self only to write of such Actions as were perform'd within the compass of this Isle, either by the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors or their Lieutenants during the time they govern'd here; I shall rather chuse sometimes to leave a gap in the Story it self, than to write Things foreign and impertinent to the Subject I am to treat of: And indeed I could willingly have forborn Writing this Part of the History at all, since it hath been done already by Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> in Latin, and Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, who have scarce omitted any thing which is worth the Collecting out of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Historians, that was necessary to compleat this Period. Therefore, were it not for leaving too great a Chasm in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Work, I could very willingly have excused my self from so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful a Task, in which I confess it is hard to equal, and much more to exceed such great Authors. But since I find there is a Necessity, in order to render the History entire, to give an Account of what was done in this Island during the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, I shall perform it as well as I am able.</p>
            <p>But that I may follow <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Example, give me leave from him, as well as other <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Authors, to give you a short Account of the Religion and Manners of the antient <hi>Britains,</hi> as well in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Time as some Ages after, before we say any thing of his Expedition hither.</p>

They had the same boldness in seeking out Dangers, and the same fear in declining of them when they were at hand: Yet that the <hi>Britains</hi> shew'd greater fierceness, as whom long Peace hath not yet softned; for we have heard (says he) that the <hi>Gauls</hi> were once fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for War, but Cowardice soon succeeded slothfulness, their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Liberty being lost together; which hath also happened to the <hi>Britains</hi> already Conquer'd; but that the rest of them remained such as the <hi>Gauls</hi> once were: their chief Strength was in their Foot, but that some Nations of them us'd also Chariots in fight; the Charioteers were more Noble, their Followers fighting for them. That in Times past they obey'd Kings, but were then divided by their Princes into Factions and Parties; neither is there any thing so advantagious for the <hi>Romans</hi> against the strongest Nations, than that they do not consult in Common; for there are very seldom Assemblies for two or three Cities to repel common Danger; so whilst they fight separately they are all alike overcome. And in the next Chapter he goes on thus; The <hi>Britains</hi> chearfully yielded to the Pressing of their Men, paying Tribute, and all the other Duties impos'd by the Emperor, provided Injuries were not done them; these they will hardly endure, for they submit that they may obey, not that they may serve as Slaves.</q>

Their Arms were a Shield and a short Spear, at whose lower end there was a Ball of Brass, that when they shake it they may terrifie their Enemies with the noise. They wore long Daggers. They can bear Hunger, Cold, and all sorts of Labour; being in the Woods they can live upon the Bark of Trees.

They mark'd their very Bodies with divers Figures of all sorts of Animals, wherefore they will not wear Cloths, lest they should hide the Painting of their Bodies.

            <p>Having given you an account of their Ancient Manners and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I will next say somewhat of their Religion. <hi>Caesar</hi> tells us, that the Religion of the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> were much the same; that they had the same Gods, and the same Priests, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Druids,</hi> who had a great Authority, not only in Religious, but Civil Matters; so that they could Excommunicate whom they thought fit; and a Person so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted could not be admitted to their Sacrifices, but was esteem'd among the number of the Accursed: so that all Persons studiously avoided him, not daring to come near him, for fear of being infected with so dangerous a Curse.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Druids</hi> taught the People that the Soul was Immortal,<note place="margin">

               </note> and went out of one Body into another: But whether they had learned this from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who traded amongst them, or from the antient <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> is uncertain.</p>
            <p>But as for their Gods, they were the same with the <hi>Gauls. Jupiter</hi> was Worshipped under the Name of <hi>Taramis,</hi> or <hi>Taran,</hi> for <hi>Taran</hi> still signifies in <hi>Welsh</hi> Thunder. <hi>Maximus Tyrius</hi> writes, That they Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship'd the highest Oak they could find, as the Figure or Representation of this God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tutates</hi> the God of Travellers is suppos'd to be the same with <hi>Mercury,</hi> and by the <hi>Britains</hi> called <hi>Duw Taith,</hi> the God of Journeys. <hi>Mars</hi> was Worshipped by the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> under the Name of <hi>Hesus</hi>; as also <hi>Camulus,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> proves, from a Coin of <hi>Cunobelin,</hi> of which he gives us the Draught, being a Man's Head with an Helmet on it, and with these Letters, <hi>CAMU.</hi> The next God of the <hi>Britains</hi> was <hi>Apollo,</hi> Worshipped by them under the Name of <hi>Beleus</hi> or <hi>Belinus,</hi> as appears by a Passage of <hi>Julius Capitolinus</hi> in his Life of <hi>Maximin.</hi> He is also suppos'd to have bin called <hi>Belatucadrus</hi>; there being divers Altars and Inscriptions

dug up of late Years out of the Earth, all of them with this Title, <hi>DEO BELATUCADRO,</hi> which Name seems to be deriv'd from the <hi>Assyrian</hi> God <hi>Bel,</hi> or <hi>Belus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for Goddesses, they Worshipped <hi>Diana</hi> under the Name of <hi>Camma.</hi> Another Goddess the <hi>Britains</hi> had, who is call'd by <hi>Dion Andraste,</hi> or <hi>Andrate,</hi> and is suppos'd to have bin the Goddess of <hi>Victory</hi>; she had a Temple at <hi>Camalodunum</hi> (now <hi>Maldon</hi> in <hi>Essex.</hi>) As for their Sacrifices, though they were most often Beasts, at sometimes they also Sacrific'd Men, as <hi>Caesar</hi> expresly tells us; and <hi>Tacitus</hi> relates, That it was usual for the <hi>Britains</hi> to consult the Gods by the Entrails of Men; <hi>Pliny</hi> also tells us, That the Misletoe growing upon an Oak, being cut with many Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, was made use of in all their Sacrifices and other Religious Rites; and also says, that <hi>Britain</hi> in his time did so Superstitiously cultivate Magick Arts, and that with so many Ceremonies; that they might have communicated it even to the <hi>Persians</hi> themselves.</p>
            <p>These are the chief Things, which antient Authors have left us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>British</hi> Customs and Manners, relating either to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, Civil, or private Life, which, if it seem tedious to you, may be passed by: So I now come to my main Design, and give you <hi>Caesar</hi>'s own Account of his first Invasion of <hi>Britain,</hi> out of the Fourth and Fifth Books of his Commentaries.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">

               </note>
               <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> having now subdued most part of <hi>Gallia,</hi> and quieted the <hi>Germans,</hi> and stopped their Incursions into his Province, resolv'd on an Expedition into <hi>Britain</hi>: his Pretences were these, That the <hi>Britains</hi> had underhand sent Supplies to the Cities of <hi>Armorica,</hi> who the Year before had revolted from his Obedience, and had joined with the rest of <hi>Gaul</hi> in a general and dangerous Rebellion, and not only so, but that they had received into their Protection the <hi>Bellovaci</hi> his Enemies, who had fled to them for aid. These <hi>Caesar</hi> there assigns as the Causes to justifie this Invasion.</p>
            <p>But though these were the seeming Causes that moved <hi>Caesar</hi> to this sudden Expedition, yet certainly a Soul so great as his could not be tempted, by the mean hopes of getting the <hi>British</hi> Pearls, to so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a War, as <hi>Suetonius</hi> in the Life of <hi>Caesar</hi> supposes, though he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions his comparing their weight and largeness by poising them in his Hand; yet I will not deny, but he might even propose the getting of these as a Bait to encourage his Souldiers in this Enterprize. By his past as well as future Actions we may guess, that besides Glory his main Design in Invading <hi>Britain,</hi> was to inure his Souldiers to Hardship, and to accustom them to the most uncouth and barbarous Enemies; that they might not be afterwards terrified at the most dangerous Enterprizes, but wholly depend upon his Fortune and Conduct.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> therefore, although Summer was almost spent, and Winter co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on very early in the Northern Parts of <hi>Gaul,</hi> yet resolved to pass over into <hi>Britain,</hi> and if the time of the Year should not suffer him to make War, yet he thought it might be to good purpose if he should but Land upon the Island, and understand the Natures of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and come to know the chief Places, Harbors and Accesses to; it all which, he says, were as yet unknown to the <hi>Gauls</hi>; for, besides Merchants, no Body commonly went thither, and even to those scarce any thing was known besides the Sea-coast, and those Countries which were opposite to <hi>Gallia</hi>: Therefore though the Merchants were called together from
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93814:84"/>
all Parts, yet could he not understand what Nations they were that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited it, nor what sort of War they made, nor what customs they used, nor what Ports were fitting to receive a Fleet of great Ships: Though by the way this seems very strange, if it were true, as they of <hi>Rhemes</hi> told <hi>Caesar,</hi> that <hi>Divitiacus</hi> King of the <hi>Soissons</hi> had a little before held <hi>Britain</hi> also under his dominion; besides the <hi>Belgian</hi> Colonies, which he affirms to have named and Peopled many Provinces there, as also what he tells us in the Sixth Book of his Commentaries, that those who desired to know the <hi>Druids</hi> Discipline went thither Yearly on purpose to learn it.</p>
            <p>But be this as it will, he thought it necessary before he exposed his own person, to send <hi>Ca. Volusenus</hi> thither with one Galley to discover these things, commanding him to return as soon as this could be effected, whilst he with all his Forces marched towards the Country of the <hi>Morini,</hi> now the Province of <hi>Picardy.</hi> Because thence was the shortest cut into <hi>Britain</hi>; hither he draws together his Ships from all parts of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Provinces, as also that Fleet which he had built last Summer for the <hi>Armorican</hi> War, in the mean time when his design was made known, being carried over by the Merchants into <hi>Britain,</hi> Ambassadours came to him from divers Princes and States of this Island, who promised to give Hostages, and to obey the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: All which being heard, <hi>Caesar</hi> as largely promising and exhorting them to continue still in that mind sent them back; and with them <hi>Comius</hi> of the <hi>Atribates</hi> (now called the Country of <hi>Arras,</hi>) whom upon the conquest thereof he had made King, and of whose Courage and Fidelity <hi>Caesar</hi> was very well assured: him he enjoyns, that he should go to as many of the States as he could, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to come into the <hi>Roman</hi> Interest, and should also inform them that he himself would speedily come over thither. But <hi>Volusenus</hi> having only surveyed the Country at a distance (which was all he could do, since he durst not go out of his Ship, nor trust himself with these <hi>Barbarians</hi>) on the Fifth day return'd to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and related to him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he had there observed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> having settled the <hi>Morini</hi> by taking Hostages of them, then gathered together about Eighty Ships of burthen, which he judged sufficient for the transporting of two Legions; but all his Gallies he distributed to his Quaestor and Lieutenants; there were also Eight Ships of burthen more, which lay Wind bound at a place Eight Miles distant, so that they could not reach the same Port; These he appointed for the Horse, the rest of the Army he committed to Q. <hi>Titus Sabinus,</hi> and L. <hi>Aurunculus Cotta,</hi> with orders to march into the Country of the <hi>Menapii,</hi> and into those Towns of the <hi>Morini,</hi> from whence Ambassadours had not yet come to him. But <hi>P· Sulpicius Rufus</hi> his Lieutenant he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to keep the Port with a sufficient Garrison. All things being thus dispatched, and having now got a fair Wind, about the the Third Watch, he set Sail, commanding the Horsemen to march to the further Port, and thence to go on board and follow him, which orders proved too slowly executed. But he himself together with the first Ships about Four a Clock in the Afternoon reached <hi>Britain,</hi> where he found divers strong Troops of the Enemies lodged on the Hills; the nature of which <note n="*" place="margin">

the Clock, that the rest of the Navy could come up to him: in the mean time calling a Council of his Lieutenants and Tribunes, he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates those things he had learn'd from <hi>Volusenus,</hi> and also what he would have done; telling them that the Nature of all Military (and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Maritime) Affairs, having a sudden and unconstant motion, all things should be executed by his orders, and that in due time. These being dismissed, and having got the Wind and Tide both with him, the signal being given, and the Anchors weighed, he sailed again forward about Eight Miles from that place, to an open and plain Shore, where he came to an Anchor. But the <hi>Britains</hi> knowing the <hi>Roman</hi>'s design, having sent their Horses and Charioteers before (which they were chiefly wont to use in Fight) followed with the rest of their Forces, and hinder'd the <hi>Romans</hi> from landing: The difficulty of which was great in these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, because the Ships by reason of their great bulk were not able to ride, but in a deep Sea; whilst the Souldiers having their hands taken up with their Arms, were yet in unknown places, not only to Leap down from the Ships and to withstand the Billows, but also at the same time to Fight their Enemies; whilst they either fighting on the Shore, or else marching but a little way into the Water, and having their hands free, fought in places where they were well acquainted, and boldly spurr'd on their Horses already managed and used to it; but the <hi>Romans</hi> being terrified with these things, and altogether unskill'd in this sort of fighting, did not shew the same briskness and courage, as they were wont to express in Land Service; which when <hi>Caesar</hi> perceived, he ordered the long Ships or Gallies (as both unusual to these <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and more ready for use) to fall off a little from the Ships of burthen, and to be rowed towards the Shore, and being laid against the naked side of the Enemies, to drive them back with Slings, Darts, and other Engines; which stood the <hi>Romans</hi> in good stead, for the <hi>Britains</hi> being terrified with the strange shape of their Gallies, the motion of their Oars, and those unusual kind of Engines, first stood still, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a little to retreat: But the <hi>Romans</hi> still delaying, because of the depth of the Sea, the Ensign of the Tenth Legion first invoking the Gods, that this action might prove fortunate and successfull, cried out, Leap down fellow Souldiers, unless you mean to betray this <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>The Fight was sharp on both sides, but the <hi>Romans</hi> were not able ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to keep their Ranks, nor get any firm footing, nor yet to follow their Ensigns: So that every Man being forced to joyn himself to the first Ensigns he met with, they were hand put to it, whilst the Enemies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all the shallows, when ever from the Shore they beheld any marching from the Ships, immediately spurring on their Horses, they charged them at disadvantage, many encompassing a few, whilst others assaulting them on the <note n="*" place="margin">i. e. <hi>that side which wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to the assistance of those whom he beheld most distressed. The <hi>Romans,</hi> as soon as they got on Shore, making head, all together charged the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and put them to flight, yet could not pursue them far for want of Horse; this only was deficient to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s wonted Fortune.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> being worsted in fight, as soon as they got together again, presently dispatched Messengers to <hi>Caesar</hi> desiring Peace; promising that they would give him Hostages, and do whatever he injoyned; together with these Ambassadours came <hi>Comius</hi> of <hi>Arras,</hi> whom (as I have before shown) had been already sent by <hi>Caesar</hi> into <hi>Britain</hi>; him, as soon as he came out of the Ship, and had related the General's Message, they laid hold on, and put into bonds; but the fight being over they sent him back, and Petitioning for Peace, cast the blame upon the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and desired that because of their Ignorance this fault might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned: but <hi>Caesar</hi> complained, That when they had of their own accord, by their Ambassadours sent to him into the Continent desiring Peace: Yet that they had without any Cause made War; But (he said) he would pardon their Folly, and therefore again injoyned them to send Hostages, part of whom they gave him presently, the residue they promised (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be sent for, from places more remote) to send him within a few days, whereupon their Princes came from all parts, and commended themselves and their States to <hi>Caesar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Peace being thus concluded, within Four days after his arrival in <hi>Britain,</hi> the Eighteen Ships which are already mentioned to have taken in the Horse; sailed from the farther Port on the opposite Shore with a gentle Gale, but when they drew near the Island, and could be now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd from the Camp: So great a Tempest suddenly arose, that none of them could hold their course; but some were driven back to the same place from whence they set forth, whilst others were carried to the further part, of the Island lying toward the <hi>West</hi> with very great hazard; for casting out their Anchors they took in so much Water, that they were forced (thô in the Night) out to Sea again, and to Steer towards the Continent: It also happened the same Night that the Moon was at the full, which is wont to make the highest Tides in the Ocean; but was then unknown to the <hi>Roman</hi> Mariners: So that at the same time the Spring Tide had filled all those Gallies with Water in which <hi>Caesar</hi> had transported his Army; though he had now drawn them on Shore; whilst the Tempest had shattered the Vessels of burthen which lay at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, neither was it in their Men's power any ways to help them; so that many Ships being Wrack'd, the rest, their Cables, Anchors, and other Tackle being broken or spoiled, became unfit for Service; this caused a great Consternation in the Army, for there were not any other Ships left, in which they could be again transported, and all things necessary were wanting to refit them, nor was there any Corn provided for them to Winter in these parts; all which being known to the <hi>Britains,</hi> their <hi>Princes,</hi> though after the Fight they had agreed to perform those things which <hi>Caesar</hi> had injoyned; yet when they understood that the <hi>Romans</hi> wanted Horses, Ships, and Provisions, and had also judged of the paucity of their Souldiers from the small circuit of the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, which seemed the less, because <hi>Caesar</hi> had transported his Legions without any Baggage; they thought it the best course again to take Arms, and thereby to hinder the <hi>Romans</hi> from fetching in Corn or other Provisions, and so to protract the War till Winter came on, for they thought if
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93814:86"/>
these were once vanquish'd and cut off from ever returning into <hi>Gaul,</hi> none of them hereafter would again presume to transport an Army into <hi>Britain</hi>; Therefore the Plot being thus laid, they began by little and little to steal out of the Camp, and privately to draw their Men out of the Fields.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Caesar</hi> although he did not then know their design, yet from the late disaster of his Ships, as also from their neglecting to send in their Hostages, suspected what would happen, therefore provided for the worst, for he every day brought in Corn out of the Fields into the Camp, and as for those Ships that were most shatter'd, he made use of their materials to refit the rest, and what things were farther necessary he ordered to be brought from the Continent, all which being executed by his Souldiers with the utmost labour and diligence, only twelve Ships being lost, he fitted out the rest ready to go to Sea: Whilst these things were in action, the seventh Legion being by course sent out to Forrage, and that there was at that time no appearance of War, whilst great part of their Men remain'd in the Fields, and others of them went, and came between that and the Camp, those Souldiers who kept guard at its Entries, gave notice, that there appear'd a greater dust than was usual in that part of the Country toward which that Legion had marched; whereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> suspecting that the <hi>Britains</hi> were undertaking some new design, commanded those <hi>Cohorts</hi> which were then upon the Guard, to march with him towards that Quarter, ordering two more to take their places, and the rest to Arm, and immediately to follow him; when he had marched some distance from the Camp, he perceived his Souldiers to be overcharged by the Enemy, and hardly able to sustain their assault, and that the Legion being drawn up close together, Darts were cast at them from all quarters; for the Corn being cut and carried away in all other parts, one piece was left, and the Enemies guessing that the <hi>Romans</hi> would come thither for it, had laid in ambush in the Woods, and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly assaulting them, being then without their Arms, and busie in reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, killing some, thereby routed the rest, being then out of their Ranks, hemming them in both with their Horse and <note n="*" place="margin">Esseda <hi>a sort of open Waggons.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Chariots:</hi> For in their Battles they make use for the most part of Chariots, with which they first of all scowre through all parts, casting Darts as they go, and so by the terror of their Horses, and ratling of their Chariot-wheels, they often break the <hi>Roman</hi> Ranks, and when they have got in among the Troops of Horse they leap down from their Chariots, and Fight on Foot, in the mean time the Charioteers retire a little from the Battle, and so place themselves, that if they should be pressed by any number of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, their Masters may find an easie retreat; by which way of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had both the speed of Horse-men, and the steadiness of Foot Souldiers; and had so enured themselves by daily use and Exercise, as that they were able to stop their Horses in full speed, though running down steep places; as likewise they had been used to turn their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots in a narrow compass, to run along the <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93814:86"/>
and presently led back the Legions to the Camp; whilst these things were doing, the <hi>Britains</hi> who where in the Fields also retired.</p>
            <p>During many days following there happned continual bad weather, which both kept the <hi>Romans</hi> in the Camp, and hindered the Enemies from attempting any thing against them.</p>
            <p>But in the mean time the <hi>Britains</hi> sent Messengers into all parts, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing abroad the small number of the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces; and how great a booty they were like to get, that this was the time of freeing themselves for ever, if they could but take the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp: Upon which great numbers of Horse and Foot being now drawn together came to the Camp: <hi>Caesar</hi> although he foresaw the Event by that which had happen'd before, and that the Enemies if once stoutly repulsed, would avoid the danger by flight; having got about Thirty Horse, whom <hi>Comius</hi> of <hi>Arras</hi> had brought over with him at his coming into <hi>Britain,</hi> drew out the Legions in Battle before his Camp, which when joyned, the Enemy being not able to bear the assault of the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, turned their backs; whom <hi>Caesar</hi> followed as long as his Men's speed and strength would permit: After a great slaughter, and burning of the Villages round about, but they return'd to their Camp. The same day Messengers came from the <hi>Britains</hi> to treat of Peace, from whom <hi>Caesar</hi> demanded double the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Hostages, which he had before enjoyned, commanding them to be brought over to him to the Continent; because the <hi>Equinox</hi> approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he did not think a Winter Voyage was to be undertaken with such weak, crazy Vessels; therefore having now got a convenient Season, a little after midnight he hoisted Sail, so that all the Ships got safe to the Continent.</p>
            <p>It is not pertinent to our History to relate here how <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Men as soon almost as they came on Shore, were set upon by the <hi>Morini,</hi> whom he had before left in peace, and whom notwithstanding he routed, and killed a great number of them till they were quite subdued.</p>
            <p>But it seems the <hi>Britains</hi> had no great Opinion of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Power, for only Two States of all <hi>Britain</hi> sent him Hostages, the rest neglecting it. These things being thus performed upon the reading of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Twenty days supplication to the <hi>Gods</hi> was decreed by the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far we have given you <hi>Caesar</hi>'s own account of his first Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into <hi>Britain,</hi> of which he had no great cause to boast; since, had it not been for his own good conduct, assisted by the timorousness of the <hi>Britains,</hi> he had never return'd to make this relation; but this much is to be acknowledged, that his landing here is a noble monument of his skill in Military affairs, for <hi>Cicero</hi> writing to his friend <hi>Atticus,</hi> tells him in one of his Epistles, that the accesses to the Island were wonderously fortify'd with strong works, or banks.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Valerius Maximus,</hi> as also <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Life of <hi>Caesar,</hi> have given us a noble Example of the <hi>Roman</hi> Courage, as well as discipline, who both relate that in the confused fight which happen'd at <hi>Caesar</hi>'s first, landing, <hi>Sceva</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Souldier having pressed too far among the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and being beset round, after incredible valour shewn, single, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Multitude, swam back safe to his General, and in the very place that rung aloud with his praises earnestly desired pardon, for his rash adventure against Military discipline; which modest confessing his fault after no bad event for such an action, wherein Valour and ingenuity
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93814:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
outweighed the transgression of Discipline, easily gain'd him pardon and preferr'd him to be a Centurion: this was that <hi>Sceva</hi> who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gave good occasion to have his name remembred at the Battle of <hi>Dyrachium,</hi> between <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> whose side he had then took.</p>

            <p>The Winter following <hi>Caesar</hi> returned into <hi>Italy</hi> as his Custome was, for some Years before; but upon his return thence finding that most of the <hi>Britains</hi> had neglected to send him their Hostages according to their former agreement, he resolved to make a fresh descent upon them, and in order to this (in the Fifth Book of his Commentaries) he tells us that upon his going into <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>buted much, but all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the rigging out of these Ships he ordered to be brought out of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> upon his return from <hi>Italy,</hi> having settled all things in the hither <hi>Gallia,</hi> made a short Expedition into <hi>Illyricum,</hi> and having settled affairs there, return'd into <hi>Gaul</hi>; where he found built by the extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry of his Souldiers, about Six hundred Vessels of that kind already described, (notwithstanding the great scarcity of all necessary materials) together with Twenty Eight Gallies, all which did not want much of being ready to be launched within a few days; so having much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his Souldiers, and Overseers of the Work, he then commanded them all to meet at the Port called <hi>Ictius,</hi> from which (he had already known) was the most convenient passage into <hi>Britain,</hi> being about Thirty Miles from the Continent.</p>
            <p>Concerning which Port, give me leave to say somewhat by the bye, since there are so many several Opinions whether it be still in being, or else is destroyed by the Sands; and indeed there is such a great difference about this Port, that there is scarce a Haven, or Creek upon all the Coast of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> from <hi>Bruges</hi> to <hi>Bulogin,</hi> but some Writer or other would make to be this <hi>Portus Ictius</hi> now mentioned by <hi>Caesar</hi>; but since there can be but Three places on this Coast, <hi>viz. Calice, Whitsand,</hi> and <hi>Buloign,</hi> that can with any probability pretend to have been this <hi>Portus Ictius,</hi> I shall neglect to speak of any of the rest, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept these Three.</p>
            <p>As for the first of these, though it be the nearest cut between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi>; yet it is not likely to have been that Ancient Haven: For though it be the shortest, yet it was not the most convenient passage in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s time; both which are to be taken notice of, since he himself in his former Book calls it the shortest; but in this, the most convenient passage, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93814:87"/>
therefore cannot answer the distance from <hi>Calice</hi> to <hi>Dover,</hi> which is but Twenty Miles; whereas <hi>Caesar</hi> describes this Port to be about Thirty Miles distant from <hi>Britain,</hi> nor was this place so much as known in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s time, being never used as a Port, till of latter Ages that <hi>Whitsand</hi> was quite stopped up by the Sands driven into it. Nor was <hi>Calice</hi> ever commonly used for a Port till <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Buloign</hi> built and walled this Town, before which time there is little mention made of it: But as for <hi>Whitsand,</hi> though it had much fairer pretences than <hi>Calice,</hi> as having been the ancient Port from whence Men usually passed from <hi>France</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> for above Five hundred Years before; till it was at last about the Fourteenth Century become utterly unserviceable for the Reason already given: Yet that this could not be the <hi>Portus Ictius,</hi> is proved by the learned <hi>Cluverius,</hi> in his Goegraphy, nor was it any ancient Port, being seldom or never made use of as such in the <hi>Roman</hi>'s time; none of the Military ways leading at all to it.</p>
            <p>And therefore only <hi>Buloign</hi> can with any probability pretend to be this <hi>Portus Ictius,</hi> as being the antient <hi>Gessoriacum,</hi> from whence the <hi>Romans</hi> most commonly passed into <hi>Britain,</hi> and best agrees with the distance that <hi>Caesar</hi> here sets down, being also proved by the above cited <hi>Cluve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>; and by our Learned Antiquary Mr. <hi>Somner,</hi> to have been the true <hi>Portus Ictius,</hi> by many unanswerable Arguments and Authorities. And as for the only Objection made against it, that it is not likely that one Place should have so many several Names: It signifies not much, since the same Place might be called by several Names in different Ages. That which was <hi>Portus Ictius</hi> in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Time, being afterwards, (when a Town came to be Built there,) called <hi>Gessoriacum,</hi> which in after-times was named <hi>Bononia,</hi> and now <hi>Buloigne.</hi> But whosoever desires to know more concerning this Matter, may consult the said, <hi>Cluverius</hi>'s <hi>Antient Germany,</hi> as also his <hi>Geography</hi>; but especially that <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Caesar</hi> in the Fifth Book of his Commentaries tells us. That having found a fit time,<note place="margin">

            <p>Then <hi>Caesar</hi> with Five Legions, and an equal Number of Horse, to what he had left behind, about Sun-set weigh'd Anchor, and sailed on with a gentle Southern Gale; but about Mid-night the Wind falling, he could not hold on his Course; but Day coming on, found he had bin carried away by the Tide, and that he had left <hi>Britain</hi> too much on his Left Hand: But then again taking Advantage of the Change of the Tide,

he endeavour'd,<note place="margin">

About Noon they arriv'd at <hi>Britain</hi> with all their Ships, but there was not any Enemies to be seen in that Place; for, as <hi>Caesar</hi> learn'd afterwards from the Prisoners, the <hi>Britains</hi> had been there with great Forces, but were terrified with the vast Multitude of the Ships, which, with Vessels of Provision and others upon private Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, amounted to above Eight Hundred; so that the <hi>Britains</hi> had quickly left the Shore, and retired into Places more remote. <hi>Caesar</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Landed his Army, and chosen a fit Place for his Camp, as soon as he learn'd from the Prisoners in what Place the Enemy's Forces were Encamped, about the Third Watch of the Night marched toward them, being not concern'd for his Ships, because he left them at Anchor in a safe and bold Shore, with Ten <hi>Cohorts,</hi> and Three Hundred Horse to guard them, under the Command of <hi>Q. Airius.</hi> But Marching that Night about Twelve Miles (towards <hi>Chilham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> as is suppos'd) he at last saw the Enemies Forces, who with their Horse marching down to the River <hi>Stoure,</hi> lying between them, began [from the higher Ground] to assail the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to give them Battel; but being repulsed by the Horse, they convey'd themselves into the Woods, where having a Place strongly Fortified, as well by Art as Nature, and which it seems they had before provided during their own Domestick Wars; for all the Avenues to it were clos'd up with Trees laid overthwart the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages. The <hi>Britains</hi> fought straggling out of the Woods, and hinder'd the <hi>Romans</hi> from entring within the Fortification: But the Souldiers of the Seventh Legion making a <note n="*" place="margin">(i.e. <hi>A kind of an Arch made with their Shields clap'd c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Testudo,</hi> did by a Mount rais'd against their Fortification soon take it, and drove them out of the Woods, having themselves receiv'd very little Loss; but since they fled, <hi>Caesar</hi> forbad to pursue them too far, because he was ignorant of the Place; and a great part of the Day being spent, he would employ the rest of it for the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of his Camp.</p>
            <p>The next Day, early in the Morning, he sent his Foot Souldiers and Horsemen, being divided into Three Bodies, upon another Expedition, that they might now pursue those that fled: But before they had march'd any great distance of Ground, the Enemy being in sight, some Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men came from <hi>Q. Atrius</hi> to <hi>Caesar,</hi> telling him, that a great Tempest ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving risen the Night before, almost all the Ships were shatter'd and cast on Shore, neither the Anchors nor Cables being able to hold them, nor could the Masters of the Vessels nor Mariners withstand the Force of the Tempest; so that by the Ships falling foul upon each other, great Damage was receiv'd; which when <hi>Caesar</hi> knew, he return'd to his Ships, and he himself beheld what he had heard from the Messengers; so that about Forty Ships being lost, the rest might be refitted, though not without much Labour. Therefore he chose some Carpenters out of the Legions, and Commanded others to be sent for from the Continent, and he writ to <hi>Labienus,</hi> that he should by the help of those Legions he had with him, speedily get ready as many Ships as he was able, whilst he himself (although it was a business of great Toyl) thought it was most convenient to have all his Ships haled on Shore, and to enclose them within the same Fortification with his Camp; in which Work he spent

about Ten Days without any Intermission of Labour Day or Night.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno ante Christ.</hi> LII.</note> The Ships being thus drawn up, and the Camp strongly Fortified, he left the same Forces to guard them as before, whilst he himself marched for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the same Place from whence he had last return'd: When he came thither, he found much greater Forces of the <hi>Britains,</hi> there assembled from all Parts. The Chief Command for managing this War being by their common Consent committed to <hi>Cassibelan,</hi> whose Territories the River <hi>Thames</hi> divided from the Maritime States, being about Eighty Miles distant from the Sea. There had been in former Times perpetual Wars between him and the Neighbouring Cities. But the <hi>Britains</hi> being now terrified by this second Invasion, had given him the Supreme Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over them all.</p>
            <p>Now from hence you may see the Falshood of <hi>Geoffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who makes this Island to have bin a Monarchy before <hi>Caesar</hi>'s coming, and <hi>Cassibelan</hi> to have bin the Sole King; whereas we find him only to have been a small Inland Prince, and the rest of the Island divided into many Petty States or Principalities. The rest of what <hi>Caesar</hi> here tells us concerning the Manners of the <hi>Britains,</hi> as also the Situation of this Island, these being either already related, or else needless, as sufficiently known, I shall pass over, and return to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Actions, as he relates them in the same Book.</p>
            <p>In this March the <hi>British</hi> Cavalry and Charioteers fought sharply with the <hi>Roman</hi> Horsemen, yet nevertheless these were Superior in all Places, and drove them to the Hills and Woods, many being slain; but the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> pursuing them too eagerly, lost some of their own Men. Some time after this the Enemy on a suddain sallied out from the Woods, the <hi>Romans</hi> not being aware of them, (being busie in Fortifying their Camp) and charged briskly upon those who were upon the Guard before the Camp. But two Cohorts (the chief of two Legions) being sent by <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> to their assistance, whilst they made a halt, as being surpriz'd with their new way of Fighting; the Enemy boldly charg'd back again through the midst of them, without the loss of a Man: So that Day <hi>Quintus Laberius Durus,</hi> a Tribune, was kill'd; but the Enemy, upon the sending out of fresh Cohorts, were repell'd, and forc'd to save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by flight.</p>
            <p>This Skirmish thus fought before the Camp, and in the Eyes of all Men, made it evident, that the Legionary Soldiers, being neither able, for the weight of their Arms, to pursue those that retreated, nor yet da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to go far from their Ensigns, were no equal Match for such a kind of Enemy; and that the Horse fought with much greater Danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Britains</hi> oftentimes retired on purpose, and when they had drawn the <hi>Romans</hi> a little from the Legions, leap'd from their Chariots and fought on Foot, to the great Disadvantage of the <hi>Romans.</hi> But the manner of their Cavalries fighting brought the same or equal Danger to those that retir'd, as to those that pursu'd: To which you may add, that they never fought in close Order, but scatter'd, and at some distance, and had their Men so Posted, that they could easily Succour each other, fresh Men still relieving those that were wounded or weary.</p>
            <p>The next Day the Enemies made a stand upon the Hills at a distance from the Camp, and began to show themselves less frequently, being not so forward to Skirmish with their Horse as they were the Day before; but about Noon, when <hi>Caesar</hi> had sent out the Three Legions with <hi>C.

Nor made they an end of chasing them, until the Horse, who were supported by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions behind them (and not giving them time either to stand still to rally, or to get down from their Chariots as they were wont) had slain a great many of them. After this Rout the <hi>British</hi> Auxiliaries which had come from all Parts return'd home; and from that time the <hi>Britains</hi> never fought the <hi>Romans</hi> again with their whole Forces: But <hi>Caesar</hi> guessing their Designs, drew his Army toward the River <hi>Thamesis</hi> into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>Cassibelan</hi>'s Territories, which River was only fordable (and that very hardly) in one place: At his arrival he found great Forces of the Enemy's there Encamp'd, and the Bank Fortify'd with sharp Stakes, and many of the same sort were also fix'd under Water, which being made known by the Prisoners and Fugitives, the Horse being sent before, he order'd the Legions immediately to follow; but the Soldiers march'd with that Courage, that, though their Heads only appear'd above Water, yet the Enemy, not enduring the Force of the Horse and Legions, quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Banks committed themselves to flight. This Ford is suppos'd by Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> in his <hi>Britannia,</hi> to have been at <hi>Coway-Stakes</hi> near <hi>Lalam</hi> in <hi>Middlesex,</hi> where the remainder of those Piles plac'd by the <hi>Britains</hi> were of late Times still to be seen, being bound about with Lead, and of the thickness of a Man's Thigh; and some of them have been of late Years pull'd up, as hindring the Passage of the Barges.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cassibelan</hi> having now lost all hopes of doing any good by downright Fighting, having dismiss'd the greater part of his Forces, retain'd only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Four Thousand Charioteers, who observ'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Marches; and going a little out of the way, hid themselves in woody and intricate Places, driving away the Men and Cattle into the Woods: But in those Parts of the Country where he knew the <hi>Romans</hi> were to march, whilst the Horse were dispersed abroad into the Fields, either for Forage or Booty, he sent out his Charioteers from the Woods, by all the known ways, and there fought the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse-Men, putting them in great hazard; whereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> strictly commanded them not to march too far from the Legions, and that they should only burn and destroy the Country as far as the Legionary Soldiers alone could safely perform it in their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. In the mean time the <hi>Trinobantes,</hi> being one of the strongest States of all those Parts, sent Ambassadors to <hi>Caesar,</hi> promising to submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to him, and perform his Commands, desiring that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend <hi>Mandubratius</hi> from the Injuries of <hi>Cassibelan,</hi> and would send him to them, that he might receive the Supreme Authority of their State. This <hi>Mandubratius</hi> being a young Prince, had fled to <hi>Caesar</hi> in <hi>Gallia</hi>; for his Father <hi>Immanuentius</hi> had been King of that Country, but having been slain by <hi>Cassibelan,</hi> his Son avoided the like Fate by flight. Whereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> sent him to them, enjoyning them to give him Forty Hostages, and Corn for his Army; they speedily perform'd his Commands, and sent him that number of Hostages, as also the Corn.

            <p>Whilst these things were doing, <hi>Cassibelan</hi> sent Messengers into <hi>Kent,</hi> in which Parts were four petty Princes, (whom <hi>Caesar,</hi> for his own Glory, calls Kings,) <hi>viz.

These Princes, with their Forces, marching to the place, the <hi>Romans</hi> sallying out upon the <hi>Britains,</hi> killed many of them, and taking <hi>Cingeterox,</hi> a noted Leader, Prisoner, returned again to their Camp without any Loss. <hi>Cassibelan</hi> hearing of the Success of this Fight, having had his Borders thus wasted, and received so considerable Losses, but being chiefly terrified with the Defection of so many States, sent Ambassadors to <hi>Caesar,</hi> by the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Comius</hi> of <hi>Arras,</hi> to treat about a Submission: <hi>Caesar</hi> being resolved to pass the Winter in the Continent, because of the sudden Commotions in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and that there was not much of the Summer left, and which might be easily spun out, demanded Hostages, and set how much yearly Tribute the <hi>Britains</hi> should pay to the People of <hi>Rome</hi>; and having far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forbad <hi>Cassibelan,</hi> either to molest <hi>Mandubratius,</hi> or the <hi>Trinobantes,</hi> Hostages being taken, <hi>Caesar</hi> marched back his Army to the Sea-side, where he found all his Ships re-fitted; but because he had a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Prisoners, as that also some of his Ships were lost by the Tempest, he resolved to transport his Army at two several Returns; yet it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, that out of so great a number of Ships, in so many Voyages to and fro, neither in this, nor the former Year, any Ship that carried the Soldiers was wanting; whereas, of those which were sent him empty from the Continent, and which afterwards <hi>Labienus</hi> had taken care to have new-built, (being to the number of Sixty) very few reached the Port; almost all of them being lost, or driven back; These when <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But when <hi>Narcissus, (Claudius</hi>'s Freed-Man) being sent by him to persuade the Army to march, had ascended the Tribunal, and went about to make a Speech to them, the Soldiers being inflam'd with Indignation, began presently to cry out, <hi>Io Saturnalia</hi>; (for in the Feast of the <hi>Saturnalia,</hi> it

                  <hi>Anno Dom·</hi> XLIII.</note>) Yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, they were at last persuaded to follow <hi>Plautius,</hi> and go on Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board. But the Forces being divided into Three Parts, lest coming all to one place, they should be hinder'd from Landing, were kept back in their Passage by contrary Winds, and suffer'd great Hardship: Yet, taking fresh Courage, because a Meteor had shot from East to West, (the very Course they were to steer,) they at last reach'd the Island, no body hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring them; for the <hi>Britains</hi> not believing the <hi>Romans</hi> would have come over, (for the Reasons you have already heard,) had prepar'd no Forces to prevent them; and therefore, not drawing together, had hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the Woods and Marshes, with Hopes of drawing on the <hi>Romans</hi> by Delays, as had before happen'd under <hi>Julius Caesar:</hi> So that <hi>Plautius</hi> spent much Time in finding them out; but after he had once found them, he overcame first <hi>Caractacus,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Togadumnus,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Ky<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobelin,</hi> (their Father being dead some time before:) For the <hi>Britains</hi> did not enjoy a Popular Liberty, but were then subject to divers Kings: Yet all these being put to flight, he receiv'd a part of the <hi>Boduni</hi> into his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, who before obey'd the <hi>Catuellani</hi>; and a Garrison being left there, he march'd to a certain River which the <hi>Britains</hi> suppos'd the <hi>Romans</hi> could not pass over without a Bridge, and so lay there the more carelesly encamp'd on the other side: Wherefore <hi>Plautius</hi> sent over the <hi>Germans</hi> first, who being accustom'd in their Armour to swim over the swiftest Rivers, set upon the Enemy on a sudden, but kill'd none, only wounded the Horses which drew their Chariots; wherewith they were so gall'd, that they would not endure their Riders. Then <hi>Plautius</hi> sent <hi>Flavius Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi> (who afterwards was Emperor,) together with <hi>Sabinus,</hi> his Brother, as his Lieutenant; who also passing the River, kill'd many of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> at unawares; yet did not the rest, for all this, run away, but the next Day renew'd the Fight with doubtful Success, until <hi>C. Sidius</hi> (tho' he had like to have fallen into the Enemy's Hands) so routed them, that although he had never been Consul, he had nevertheless Triumphal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours bestowed upon him.</p>
            <p>From hence the <hi>Britains</hi> retired to the Mouth of the River <hi>Thames,</hi> and easily pass'd it, knowing all the Fords and Shallows; whither the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> following them, were in great danger: But when the <hi>Germans</hi> had again swum over, and that some others had likewise pass'd by a Bridge that lay higher, the <hi>Britains</hi> being every where routed, they made a great Slaughter of them; though pursuing the Residue too rashly, they fell into the Marshes, and many were lost. For these Reasons, and because the <hi>Britains</hi> were not, by the Death of <hi>Togadumnus,</hi> (who was kill'd,) at all discourag'd, but rather more eager to revenge his Death, <hi>Plautius</hi> doubting the Success, would not proceed farther; but putting Garrisons into those Places he had conquer'd, sent notice to the Emperor <hi>Claudius,</hi> who had before order'd him to do so, if any thing extraordinary or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected should happen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Claudius</hi> having receiv'd this Message,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> XLIV.</note> immediately got all things ready (together with divers Elephants) for this Expedition; and being now the Third Time Consul, and having chosen <hi>Britain</hi> for his Province, he committed the Care of the City and Soldiers to <hi>L.

                  </gap>gne</hi>;) where again embarking, he pass'd over into <hi>Britain,</hi> and joyn'd his Forces that expected him near the <hi>Thames</hi>; then passing over the River, he fought with the <hi>Britains</hi> in a pitch'd Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and obtain'd the Victory; taking <hi>Camolodunum,</hi> the Royal Seat of <hi>Kynobelin,</hi> together with many Prisoners, some by Force, and some by Surrender. For these Exploits, he was oftentimes by his Soldiers saluted <hi>Imperator,</hi> or <hi>General,</hi> though against the received Custom of the <hi>Romans</hi>; for it was not lawful before to assume that Title more than once in the same War. <hi>Claudius</hi> having thus disarm'd the <hi>Britains,</hi> left them to the Government of <hi>Plautius</hi>; ordering to subdue those that remain'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquer'd: But as for those that submitted, he remitted the Confiscation of their Estates; which so oblig'd the <hi>Britains,</hi> that they built him a Temple, and ador'd him as a God. But whilst he return'd towards <hi>Rome,</hi> his Sons-in-Law <hi>Pompeius</hi> and <hi>Silanus</hi> were sent before with the News of his Victory, which was accomplish'd in Sixteen Days. For no longer stay'd he in <hi>Britain,</hi> and that with so little Noise, that it gave occasion to <hi>Suetonius</hi> (thô erroniously) to write, that he suddu'd <hi>Britain</hi> without ever a Battel, or any Blood-shed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Claudius</hi> returning thus Triumphantly to <hi>Rome</hi> (from whence he had been absent but Six Months in all) the Senate decreed his Son the Sirname of <hi>Britannicus,</hi> to himself a Triumph, and annual Games, with two Triumphal Arches, one in the City, the other in <hi>Gaul,</hi> from whence he had passed into <hi>Britain.</hi> In his Triumph (performing all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Custom) he ascended the Stairs of the <hi>Capitol</hi> on his Knees, his two Sons-in-Law supporting him on each side; he then bestow'd on those who had serv'd with him in this Expedition (not only such who had been <hi>Consuls,</hi> but even bare <hi>Senators</hi>) Triumphal Ornaments. I shall not trouble you with the rest of this Solemnity, since it is not much to the Matter in hand, and also transacted out of this Island, only I shall Remark,<note place="margin">S.</note> That it appears this Conquest of <hi>Britain</hi> was look'd upon as so considerable, that the Senate thought fit to Decree as high Honours to the Emperor, who had now subdu'd but part of this Island; as they had done for any former Conquerors, and the Sirname of <hi>Britannicus,</hi> was esteem'd as Glorious as that of <hi>Germanicus, Africanus,</hi> or <hi>Asiaticus</hi>: And even in the heighth of the <hi>Roman</hi> Grandure it was esteem'd so considerable a part of the Empire, that it was held not Inferior to any of the forementioned Provinces, and cost more Legions in gaining and preserving it than all <hi>Asia,</hi> and was never forsaken by the <hi>Romans,</hi> but in their last Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>I shall now by the way take a little notice of <hi>Geoffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Relation of this <hi>British</hi> War, which is much different from the <hi>Roman</hi> Accounts of it, he making <hi>Claudius</hi> to Land at <hi>Portchester</hi> in <hi>Hampshire,</hi> and to have Besieg'd that Town, to the Relief whereof <hi>Guiderius,</hi> or <hi>Guider</hi> (the above-mention'd King of the <hi>Britains</hi>) quickly came, and that a Battel ensuing it went on the <hi>Britains</hi> side; until <hi>Hamo,</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> disguising himself like a <hi>Britain,</hi> slew the King; whereupon <hi>Arviragus</hi> his Brother, (lest the <hi>Britains</hi> should be discourag'd) conceal'd the King's Death, and arming himself in his Armour, continued the Battel, and so obtain'd a great Victory, and then succeeded his Brother <hi>Guider.</hi> But since none of the <hi>Roman</hi> Historians make any mention of these Kings, nor of <hi>Hamo</hi> (who is here suppos'd to have kill'd <hi>Guider</hi>) it is probable,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93814:92"/>
that their very Succession is as Fabulous as <hi>Arviragus</hi> his Encounters with <hi>Hamo</hi>; and his Marriage with <hi>Genuissa,</hi> a supposed Daughter of <hi>Claudius</hi>;<note place="margin">

After this Success, <hi>Ostorius</hi> marched into the Country of the <hi>Cangi</hi> (who they were is not well known) where he plundered and laid waste their Fields, they not daring to give him Battel; and if at any time they ventur'd out of their Coverts to fall on his Rear, they always met with sharp entertainment: At last he approached near the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea, where news was brought him of stirs among the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to have been the Inhabitants of <hi>Yorkshire, Lancashire,</hi> and the other <hi>Northern</hi> Countries). Upon this he resolves to return, intending not to attempt any new Design, till he had fully quieted those Commotions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him: and indeed the <hi>Brigantes</hi> were soon quieted; those few who took Arms being all Slain, and the rest pardoned. But the Nation of the <hi>Silures</hi> (the Inhabitants of the now South <hi>Wales</hi>) were not to be won by Clemency, or terrified by Severity; but would needs have a War, and if subdued, were to be kept in obedience by Garrisons of Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary Souldiers.</p>
            <p>So he marched against these <hi>Silures,</hi> who, besides their natural Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,<note n="†" place="margin">

about, encouraging their Men, diminishing their Fears,<note place="margin">

But <hi>Caractacus</hi> notably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stir'd himself, and with quick motions going from place to place, <hi>Cryed out, this was the Day, and this the Field, which would be either the recovery of their Liberty, or the beginning of a new and perpetual Slavery: and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Names of his glorious Ancestors, who had driven out</hi> Caesar <hi>the Dictator; and by whose Valour they had hitherto been freed from the</hi> Roman <hi>Axes and Tributes; and still kept their Wives and Children preserved from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At these, or such like Speeches, the Army testified their Joy by loud Shouts and Acclamations; and every one, according to his Country Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, bound himself by Oath, that neither Force nor Wounds should make them yield.</p>
            <p>This Couragious alacrity in the Enemy startled the <hi>Roman</hi> General: especially when he descried the River before him, and the Rampire made upon its Banks, both of great difficulty to be passed; whilst the steep Hills full of Armed Men hanging over their heads, gave a dismal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, and made a terrible Scene of War: but the Common Souldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eager for Battel required the Signal; <hi>Crying out, nothing was impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to Valour:</hi> This impatience was increased by the <hi>Prefects</hi> and <hi>Tribunes,</hi> who were of the same Opinion. Then <hi>Ostorius</hi> having first tried which Fords were passable, and which not, led them on as insensible of Danger; who with no great difficulty wading through the River, when they were come near to the Rampire, and that it came to be disputed with Darts and Javelins, greater loss followed on the <hi>Roman</hi> than <hi>British</hi> side: So that not being able longer to endure it, the Legionary Souldiers joyning close together made a Testudo; whereupon this rude Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of rough Stones being thrown down, and the <hi>Romans</hi> meeting with them hand to hand, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> soon fled to the tops of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains: but thither also the heavy as well as the Light-Armed Souldiers quickly followed them; whilst the <hi>Britains</hi> assaulting them with their Darts, these received them in close order, whereby their Ranks were soon broken, who made use of no defence, either of Brest-plates or Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets: So that, if they could have resisted the Auxiliaries, yet they were beat down by the Swords and Darts of the Legionary Souldiers; and if they turned from these, they were again routed by the broad Swords and Spears of the Auxiliaries. The Victory was very remarkable, the Wife and Daughter of <hi>Caractacus</hi> being taken Prisoners, and his Brethren submitting to Mercy.</p>
            <p>But though he had committed himself to the Fidelity of <hi>Cartismandua</hi> Queen of the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> (yet as unsafe Counsels prove commonly unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate) he was by her, delivered bound to the <hi>Victors</hi> in the Seventh Year (according to <hi>Tacitus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>If my mind,</hi> O Caesar, <hi>had been as moderate in the Heigth of Fortune, as my Birth and Dignity was Eminent, I might have entred as a Friend, rather than a Captive into this City; nor couldst thou have disliked one for a Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, so Noble by Descent, and Ruling so many Natinos. My present Estate, tho to me disgraceful, to thee is Glorious: I had once Riches, Horses, Arms, and Men; no wonder if I was not contended to lose them, but if you will extend your Empire over all others; then of necessity all others must obey you: If I sooner had been brought to yield, my Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Caesar</hi> mov'd at so sad a Spectacle of Fortune, but especially at the Nobleness of his bearing it, gave him Pardon, as also to his Wife and Brothers; they being all unbound went also to do the like Reverence to the Empr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Senators</hi> being then also summon'd, made long and pompuous Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses upon this taking of <hi>Caractacus</hi>; saying, it was no less famous than when <hi>P. Scipio</hi> shewed <hi>Scyphax,</hi>

            <p>After this, Affairs continued some time prosperous; but presently after became more doubtful: either because that <hi>Caractacus</hi> being now remov'd, he thought the <hi>Britains</hi> as good as subdued, and so the Wars was less eagerly pursued; or whether the Enemy in Compassion of so great a King burnt more fiercely with Revenge; for they had beset the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in his Camp, and fell upon the Legionary <hi>Cohorts,</hi> who had been left to build Forts among the <hi>Silures</hi>; and unless Assistance had come in to them speedily from the Neighbouring Garrisons and Castles, the whole Army had then perished; nevertheless the <hi>Governour</hi> with Eight <hi>Centurions,</hi> and the most forward Souldiers of each Company were cut off, and not long after they routed those that were Forraging, as also some Troops sent to their Relief.</p>

The <hi>Britains</hi> rejoycing, that thô not a Battle; yet a lingering War had taken off so great a Souldier.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Caesar</hi> understanding the Death of his Lieutenant, lest the <hi>Province</hi> should remain without a <hi>Governour,</hi> sent <hi>A. Didius</hi> in his room, who quickly arriving there, found Affairs but in an ill Condition; for in the mean while there had happened an unsuccessful Engagement of that Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion over which <hi>Manlius Valens</hi> commanded: the Fame of which Exploit being also much increased by the Enemy's reports, that thereby they might terrifie the new <hi>General,</hi> which was also much increased by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that if the War were well ended he might win the greater Glory, or if otherwise, he might gain the easier pardon. But the <hi>Silures</hi> had already done much mischief, and made Incursions all abroad, until by <hi>Didius</hi>'s meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them they were repelled; which being one of the last Actions that happened in <hi>Claudius</hi>'s Reign, I shall only take notice that he lived about Three Years after his sending <hi>Didius</hi> hither, and died (as is suppos'd) of Poyson given him by his Wife <hi>Agrippina</hi>; therefore since by his Conquest of so great a part of <hi>Britain,</hi> he is accounted by most Authors as the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign</hi> power thereof: I shall for the future give you the Names of all the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors his Successours, that ruled here, till their quitting of this <hi>Island,</hi> whether they were here in Person or not. <hi>Claudius</hi> was succeeded by</p>

               <note place="margin">

               </note> for the space of many Years, he had for their better remembrance put all together; It plainly appearing, that most of those things he there treats of, are to be referr'd to <hi>Nero</hi>'s Reign; I shall make bold to place in the beginning of his Time that long War between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Venutius,</hi> which <hi>Tacitus</hi> thus relates.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Caractacus</hi> was gone, <hi>Venutius</hi> a Prince of the <hi>Jugantes,</hi> was the most remarkable for Military skill, having continued faithful hitherto;<note place="margin">

               </note> being defended by the <hi>Roman</hi> Arms, as long as he kept Queen <hi>Cartisman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua</hi> for his Wife; but a Quarrel happened between them, and presently after a War; in which he at last took up Arms against the <hi>Romans,</hi> to which <hi>Tacitus</hi> tell us in another place, he was highly provoked, not only upon the account of his natural Fierceness, but by the injuries of the Queen his Wife; who, being proud of her Nobility, had increased her power, after her taking of <hi>Caractacus,</hi> as you have heard; so that abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Wealth, and wallowing in Luxury, she despised her Husband <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius,</hi> and made <hi>Vellocatus</hi> his Armour-bearer the partner of her Bed and Kingdom: So that upon this, immediately the whole State became di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; on the Husband's side were the inclinations of the Nation; for the Adulterer, the Queen's Lust and Violence; from whence proceeded
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93814:95"/>
a Civil War among themselves;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> LV.</note> for <hi>Cartismandua</hi> by her Stratagems had intercepted the Brother and Kinsman of <hi>Venutius:</hi> whence those of his party were the more provoked; meer shame egging them on, lest they should be subject to the command of a Woman: whereupon a strong Party of the choicest Troops Invade her Kingdom, which being foreseen; and certain <hi>Cohorts</hi> being sent to her assistance, they fought a sharp Battel, whose beginning though doubtful, yet the Conclusion proved prosperous, thô the Legion which <hi>Cessius Nascia</hi> Commanded, fought with different Success.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Tacitus</hi> tells us in another place, that <hi>Venutius</hi> sending for more Supplies (I suppose from his own Kingdom;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>History</hi> III.</note>) as also by a general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the <hi>Brigantes</hi> themselves, brought <hi>Cartismandua</hi> into extream hazard; so that she was forced to seek Aid of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whose <hi>Cohorts,</hi> though in diverse Battels they freed the Queen from danger, yet was the Kingdom still left to <hi>Venutius,</hi> and the War continued on the <hi>Romans</hi>: I suppose <hi>Tacitus</hi> means this, during the times of all other Lieutenants, though not expresly mentioned by him; for he tells us in his Life of <hi>Agricola,</hi> That <hi>Veranius</hi> succeeded <hi>Didius,</hi> and dying within the Year, that then <hi>Suetonius Paulinus</hi> found affairs prosperous for the first Two Years: yet it seems could not drive <hi>Venutius</hi> out of his Kingdom. But thô <hi>Tacitus</hi> afterwards in the Third Book of his Histories relates this Story of <hi>Cartismandua,</hi> as if it had fallen out in the time of <hi>Vitellius,</hi> and that the Discord and Civil Wars which then happened in the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, had encouraged the <hi>Britains</hi> to take Arms under the Command of <hi>Venutius</hi>; yet it is evident from what he hath already said in his <hi>Annals,</hi> that this War with <hi>Venutius</hi> must have been begun in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time, since <hi>Didius</hi> was the first Lieutenant in <hi>Britain,</hi> who sent any assistance to <hi>Cartisman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua</hi>; and who must be supposed to have been dead, or remov'd some time before the Death of <hi>Nero</hi>; or else there would be no room left for his two Successors above mentioned; the latter of which ended his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment with the Reign of <hi>Vitellius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to our History, it is certain that <hi>Veranius</hi> the Successor of <hi>A. Didius</hi> did little,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Annal.</hi> LXIII.</note> except his wasting the <hi>Silures</hi> by many small In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions; being hindred by Death from carrying the War any further. A Man of great reputation for his Discipline, but, as appears by his last Words in his Testament, guilty of manifest Vanity and Ambition; for after many things spoken in Flattery of <hi>Nero,</hi> he said that he would have subjected all, <hi>viz.

To which end he built many flat bottomed Vessels, for that shallow and uncertain Shore: his Foot thus wasted over, his Horse waded or swom, where thick upon the Strand stood several gross bands of Men well Armed; many Women like Furies running to and fro in dismal Habits, with their Hair hanging loose about their Shoulders, held Torches in their Hands: The <hi>Druids</hi> (who were their Priests, of whom we have

After this, a Garrison was impos'd upon the Conquer'd; and the Groves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sacred to their cruel Superstitions, were cut down; for they look'd upon it as piece of Religion to sacrifice Captives, and to consult the Gods by inspecting Humane Entrails. But whilst <hi>Suetonius</hi> was thus in Action, Word is brought him, that a sudden Defection had happen'd in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; the Occasion of which is thus farther related by our Author.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Prasutagus,</hi> King of the <hi>Icenians,</hi> abounding in Wealth, had left <hi>Caesar</hi> Co-heir with his two Daughters, thereby hoping to have secur'd from Wrong both his Kingdom, and his Family; which fell out far otherwise: For, under Colour to Oversee and take Possession of the Emperor's new Inheritance, his Kingdom became a Prey to the Centurions; his House to ravenous Officers, his Wife <hi>Boadicia</hi> being violated with Stripes, and his Daughters ravish'd: And, as if the <hi>Romans</hi> had gotten the whole Kingdom as a Legacy, the cheifest Men of the <hi>Icenians</hi> are turn'd out of their ancient Estates, and those of the Royal Family treated like Slaves. By which Indignities, and for fear of greater Evils when they should be reduc'd into the Form of a Province, they took Arms. The <hi>Trinobantes</hi> were also moved to rebel, whilst others who were not as yet reduced to Servitude conspir'd with those that were, to regain their former Liberty. This proceeded from a cruel Hatred against the Veterane Soldiers, who being planted in the late Colony of <hi>Camalodunum,</hi> drove Men from their Houses and Estates in the Country, calling them Slaves and Captives: The other Soldiers also encouraging this Violence of the Veteranes, as well through a Likeness in Manners, as through an Hope of the same Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense. To which may be also added, That the Temple dedicated to <hi>Claudius</hi> was look'd upon as a Badge of their Eternal Slavery; and the Priests ordain'd for it, under a Shew of Religion, seiz'd upon divers Men's Estates. Nor did it seem difficult to destroy a Colony, defended by no Fortifications; which was but little fore-seen by the <hi>Roman</hi> Commanders, who rather had studied their Pleasure, than Safety.</p>

            <p>There was within the Town a moderate Garrison of Soldiers, who trusted in the Strength of the Temple; but some who were conscious of the intended Rebellion, had perplex'd their Councils, and hindred them from drawing any Line about the Place; nor were the Old Women and Children turn'd out, and the Fighting Men (as they ought to have done) only left behind. Thus the <hi>Romans</hi> being secure, as in the midst of Peace, were circumvented by a Multitude of Barbarians, so that all Places were quickly Spoil'd and Burnt at the very first Assault; the Temple, in which the Soldiers had gotten together, held out Two Days, but was at last taken. The <hi>Britains</hi> being thus Victors, marched out to meet <hi>Petillius Cerialis,</hi> Lieutenant of the Ninth Legion, then coming to their Succour, they routed his Legion, and killed all the Foot; but <hi>Cerialis</hi> with the Horse escaped into the Camp, which was defended by the Trenches. <hi>Catus Decianus</hi> the Procurator, whose Covetousness, and the hatred of the Province that ensued upon it, had been the Cause of this War, fled like a Coward into <hi>Gaul.</hi>

               <hi>Dion</hi> says of <hi>Boadicia,</hi> the Widow of <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sutagus,</hi> who chiefly stired up and perswaded the <hi>Britains</hi> to make this War upon the <hi>Romans. Boadicia</hi> (says he) was a <hi>British</hi> Lady of a Royal Race, who did not only Govern with great Authority in Peace, but also order'd the whole War: Her Disposition was more Masculine than became a Woman, being of a tall Statute, and a severe Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, having a harsh Voice and yellow Hair, which being let loose, hung dishevel'd below her Wast, wearing a great Gold Chain about her Neck, and having on a loose Coat wrought with divers Colours, and a thick Mantle button'd over it, holding a Spear in her Hand. Having now gotten together an Army of an Hundred Thousand Men, which were drawn up ready to fight, the Queen getting up on a high heap of Earth, made a Speech to her Soldiers, which, since it is tedious and most likely to be made only to set out the Eloquence and Invention of the Author, I shall pass over, and shall rather give you what she is suppos'd to have said, out of <note n="‖" place="margin">

            <p>
               <hi>Boadicia</hi> carried her Daughters with her in a Chariot, in which being driven about to every Nation that compos'd her Army, she spoke to this Effect: <q>That since it was no new thing for the <hi>Britains</hi> to make a War under the Conduct of a Woman, therefore for her part, thô descended of Noble Ancestors, she sought not so much to Revenge the loss of her Kingdom and Treasures, but rather (as one of the Common People) the loss of her Liberty, the bruising her Body with Stripes, and the violated Chastity of her Daughters. That the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Lust was such, that they did not leave either old Age or Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity undefil'd: That the Gods had hitherto favour'd her just Revenge, one Legion being already cut off, which dared to fight; the rest ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hid themselves in their Camps sought how to run away, as not being able to endure the Shouts and Clamours of so many Thousands, much less their Power: So that if they would but consider their own great Forces, they ought either to overcome or die in that Battel.</q>

His Advice then was, That they should keep close together; and having cast their Darts, should afterwards continue the Slaughter with their Pikes and Swords, not minding the Spoil, since the Victory once obtain'd, all would be their own.

The like Assault, was also made by the Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries; whilst the Horse, with their Spears, routed all that stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: The rest turn'd their Backs and fled, but could hardly escape, because their own Wagons had closed up all the Avenues: But the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers gave no Quarter, not so much as to the Women; and the very Draught-Cattel being run thorough, increas'd the Heap of the dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cases. This Victory was very eminent; and the Glory of it equall'd those of Ancient Times, since it is related, that not less than 80000 <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> were then slain; but of the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers, not above 400, and about as many wounded. <hi>Boadicia</hi> ended her Life by Poyson: And <hi>Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Posthumus,</hi> the Commander of the Second Legion, when he heard the good Success of those of the Fourteenth and Twentieth, since he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded his own Men of the like Glory; and had also, contrary to the Rules of War, refused to obey the Orders of his General, run himself through with his own Sword.</p>
            <p>The Army, after a general Review, still kept the Field, to make an end of the War; and <hi>Suetonius</hi> increased his Forces with 2000 Legionary Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and 8 Cohorts of Auxiliaries, together with 1000 Horse sent out of <hi>Germany</hi>; by whose coming, the Ninth Legion was recruited: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, all those Cohorts, with some others, were put into Winter-Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Whatsoever Nations continued either Enemies, or Neuters, were now destroy'd with Fire and Sword. But nothing afflicted them so much as Hunger; having been careless to sow Corn, because they rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Provisions as their own; all their Hands being employ'd in the War. But these fierce Nations were the less inclin'd to treat of Peace, because <hi>Julius Classicianus,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Catus,</hi> differing with <hi>Suetonius,</hi> their private Animosities hinder'd the publick Good; the former giving out, that a new Lieutenant was to be expected, without the Rancour of a Conqueror, and who would treat those that submitted to them with Mercy and Clemency: Having also written to <hi>Rome,</hi> that there was no End to be expected of this War, unless <hi>Suetonius</hi> were remov'd; attributing all Miscarriages to his ill Conduct; and any happy Success, to the good Fortune of the Commonwealth.</p>

            <p>But one thing is by no means to be passed by without particular No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; that it was in the Reign of one of these Emperors, either <hi>Claudius,</hi> or <hi>Nero,</hi> though uncertain in which, that <hi>Gildas,</hi> as do divers other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Authors, supposes the Gospel to have been first preached in the Island; though by whom, is also unknown, no ancient Church-Historian making any mention of it: And indeed, there is much difference in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of latter Writers about it; some attributing it to St. <hi>James,</hi> the Son of <hi>Zebedee</hi>; some of the Modern <hi>Greek</hi> Ecclesiastical Writers, to <hi>Simon Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotes,</hi> or St. <hi>Peter</hi>; others of them, to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who is said to have Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd one <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> (afterwards a Martyr) to be a Bishop in <hi>Britain</hi>; as you may see at large in the first Chapter of Archbishop <hi>Usher</hi>'s <hi>Antiquities of the</hi> British <hi>Churches.</hi> But though he there understands those Passages in <hi>Gildas,</hi> where he speaks of <hi>Christ,</hi> the true Sun's affording his Rays, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Knowledge of his Precepts, to this Island, then shivering with Icy Cold, as if it referr'd to the very first Preaching of the Gospel, in the Reign of <hi>Tiberius</hi>; yet the learned Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> now Lord Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> hath very ingeniously shewn us in his learned Work, called <note n="*" place="margin">Cap <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But as soon as <hi>Vespasian</hi> was acknowledged in <hi>Britain,</hi> as well as in the rest of the Provinces; Famous Generals and great Armies were sent hither, whereby the Enemies hopes were quite defeated: For the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror presently sent into <hi>Britain, Petilius Caerialis</hi> one of Consular Dignity, as his Lieutenant; under whom Valour found not only a room to show it self, but also an Example in himself: For in the first place, he attack'd the State of the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> which is counted the most Populous in the whole Island, in which Expedition many Skirmishes happen'd, though sometimes not without much Blood-shed; he taking in a great part of their Country by Conquest: But when <hi>Caerialis</hi> had indeed both eclips'd the Fame, as well as prevented the Care of a Successor; <hi>Julius Frontinus</hi> succeeded him, who did as worthily sustain that great Charge, being a very brave Man; he subdued the <hi>Silures,</hi> overcoming both the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of Places, and the Valour of the Enemies.</p>
            <p>In this State was <hi>Britain,</hi> when the Emperor sent hither <hi>Agricola</hi> as his Lieutenant,<note place="margin">

For <hi>Caerialis,</hi> had from the beginning enured him to Labours and Dangers; and at last communicated a share of Reputation often times for a Tryal, giving him the Command of some part of the Army, and sometimes encouraging his former Success, by giving him the Command of greater Forces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:93814:99"/>This is the Character, which <hi>Tacitus</hi> gives us of this Great Man;<note place="margin">

But because the <hi>Ordovices</hi> durst not come down into the Plains; he Lead the Army against them himself; that by exposing his own person to equal Dangers, he might make them all a like Couragious: and having fought the <hi>Ordovices,</hi> he almost cut off their whole Nation.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Agricola,</hi> knowing that reputation is chiefly gained by success; and that as this first Enterprize succeeded, so it would give a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to those that followed; He resolved therefore to subdue the Isle of <hi>Mona</hi>; from the Conquest of which <hi>Paulinus</hi> was recalled by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of the <hi>Britains,</hi> as you have already heard; but wanting Ships for this Expedition, which was undertaken on the sudden: He used this Policy for the Transporting his Men; he commanded them all to lay aside their Baggage, sending over first the chief of the Auxiliaries; who were acquainted with their shallows, and whose Countries use had taught them to Swim, govern their Horses, and Fight all at once, which was executed so on the sudden, that the <hi>Britains,</hi> who expected Fleets, and thought without Shipping nothing could attack them, were now surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and daunted; since they believed nothing was difficult or invincible to Men, so resolutely prepared for War; whereupon they desired Peace, and delivered up the Island.</p>
            <p>This sudden Success gained <hi>Agricola</hi> a great Reputation; especially since he employed even his first Entrance into his Province, in labour and War; which by other Governours was spent in Ceremonies, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing of Commands; nor did he make use of his Prosperity for Osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or call this Expedition a Conquest; but only that he had reduced those to Obedience, who had been before subdued; neither did he so much as adorn his Letters to <hi>Rome</hi> with Laurels: (as the custom was) Yet even by this, slighting of Fame and Reputation, he at the same time encreased it; all Men admiring that, having such great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions of future success, he could thus conceal such noble Actions.<note place="margin">

So that no Castle of <hi>Agricola</hi>'s was ever taken by Force, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted: But from these, being well provided with Provisions for a Years Siege, his Men made frequent Sallies. So that the Enemy, who before used in Winter to re-gain what in Summer they had lost, were now alike in both Seasons straitned and kept short. Neither did <hi>Agricola,</hi> as too covetous of Honour, attribute to himself things done by others; since every Officer or Centurion had him for an impartial Witness, as well as Judge of his Actions; And though he were taxed by some, as too bitter in his Reproofs, yet must it be granted, that as he was gentle to the Good, so he was morose to the bad; but his Anger did not last long: Nor needed one to have fear'd his Silence, or Reservedness; for he thought it much better to displease a Man, than hate him.</p>

The War was thus carry'd on, both by Sea and Land; Nay, often in the same Camp, the Foot, with the Horse-men, and Marine Forces, would meet, and make merry together; where each in his Turn would extol their own Feats and Adventures; comparing the Dangers of the Woods and Mountains, with the Accidents and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards of the Waves and Tempests; and that as the <hi>Britains</hi> by Land, so the Ocean it self was by them subdued: Thus they boasted in a Soldier-like way.

But then the <hi>Caledonians</hi> made great Preparations for War, though with greater Fame than Reality; as it is usual for it to relate too much of things unknown, giving out, as if they had assaulted and taken some <hi>Roman</hi> Fort. This News made some afraid, who being Cowardly, under the Shew of Prudence, took upon them to advise the General, that they ought to retreat to the other side of the <hi>Frith</hi>; and that they should rather do it voluntarily, than by constraint. But when <hi>Agricola</hi> knew that the Enemy would invade him in many distinct Parties, lest he should be environ'd by Numbers far exceeding his own, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self divided his Army into Three Detachments.</p>

And this, indeed, is the hard Fate of War; All challenge a Share in the Success, whilst Misfortunes are laid upon a single Person. However, the <hi>Britains</hi> would not own themselves beaten by the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers, but by the Cunning and Conduct of the General; and therefore they had no meaner Thoughts of themselves than before, but made new Levies, in order to prosecute the War; and beforehand carried their Wives and Children into Places of Safety, send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about, through all their Cities, to enter into new Confederacy; which was afterwards ratified with solemn Rites and Sacrifices: And so their Spirits being thus heightned, they at present return'd home.</p>
            <p>The same Summer, a Cohort of <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s, raised in <hi>Germany,</hi> and sent into <hi>Britain,</hi> having slain a Centurion, and other Soldiers that were appointed to exercise them, deserted, and went to Sea in three Pinnaces; and having kill'd two of the Masters whom they suspected, the other they constrain'd to do his Duty. Having thus escaped, and none know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was become of them, and having no Pilates, they were carried at random, as the Tides and Winds drove them to and fro. Thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing the Island, they practis'd Piracy where they landed; and often fighting with the <hi>Britains,</hi> who defended their Goods, were sometimes Victors, and sometimes worsted; till at last they were driven to that great Extremity for want of Provision, that first they devour'd the weakest of their own Men; and then drew Lots, who of them should be eaten after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Thus having floated round <hi>Britain,</hi> and lost their Ships for want of Skill to steer them, getting on Shore, they were taken, and sold as Pirates, first by the <hi>Suevians,</hi> and afterwards by the <hi>Frisians,</hi> till at last they were sold into <hi>Britain</hi>; where the strangeness of the Accident render'd this Discovery of the Island more famous.</p>

If the Enemy be Rich, they are greedy of his Wealth; if Poor, they covet Glory; whom neither the <hi>East</hi> nor <hi>West</hi> could ever satisfie; the only Men in the World who pursue both the Rich and the Needy with equal Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite: To Kill and Plunder, they call Governing; and when they have brought Desolation on a Country, they term it Peace. That Nature, by nearest ties, had link'd their Children and Relations to them, yet even these were taken away and pressed into their Service: That their Wives and Sisters, if they escap'd their Violence, yet could not avoid Dishonour; since when they came as Guests into their Houses, they were sure to Debauch them: Their Goods and Fortunes they made their Tributes; their Corn, their Provisions to supply their Gran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>He then proceeds to exhort them to be tenacious of their Liberty, lest (like the last Slave in a private Family, who is the Sport and Scorn of his Fellows when conquer'd) they should be flouted by those who had been used as Drudges long before, advising them to take Courage and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample from the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> who under the Conduct of a Woman had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most quite destroyed the <hi>Romans,</hi> and might have driven them out of <hi>Britain,</hi> had they not failed in the Attempt by their too great Security and Success. Then magnifying the Valour and Strength of his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and lessening that of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as made up of divers Nations, who unwillingly served them, and as soon as they durst would turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; he concluded with shewing what Advantages they had above the <hi>Romans,</hi> to make them hope for Victory, and the miserable Slavery they were like to undergo if they were vanquished; and therefore going now to Battel, advised them to remember the Freedom of their Ancestors, as well as the Danger of Slavery to themselves and their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.</p>

               </note> and that as he had exceeded his Predecessors in Success, so they had all former Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. That <hi>Britain</hi> was now no longer known, only by Fame and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; and that as they have had the Honor to discover, so likewise might they to subdue it: That he had often heard them ask, <hi>When they should meet the Enemy?</hi> but now they had their Desires, now was the time to shew their Valour, and that as every thing would happen as they could wish if they Conquer'd; so all things made against them, if they were overcome. That if it was Great and Noble to have Marched so much Ground, to have past so many Woods, and both the <hi>Friths,</hi> yet if they fled, the very same things would be their Hindrance and Destruction: That as for his part he had been long since satisfied, that to run away was neither safe for the Soldier nor General; and that a Commendable Death was to be preferr'd before the Reproaches of an Ignominious Life; that Safety and Honour were now inseparably conjoyned: And let the worst happen, yet how glorious would it be to die in the utmost Bounds of the World and Nature? Then putting them in mind of their late Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, and representing these <hi>Britains</hi> they were now to fight with, as the Meanest and most Rascally of all the Nations they had Conquer'd, so he doubts not but they will afford them an occasion of a memorable Victory. Then concludes, in advising them to make an end of the War, and to Fifty Years Labours add one great concluding Day, by which means they should approve themselves to their Country; and that it should never be justly laid to their Charge, that they had Protracted the War, nor let slip any Opportunity of compleating their Conquest.</p>
            <p>Whilst <hi>Agricola</hi> was yet speaking, the Soldiers expressed great Signs of their Eagerness and Resolution, but the Conclusion of his Speech was received with loud and joyful. Acclamations, whilst every Man stood to his Arms, and shewed his Impatience to march on. <hi>Agricola</hi> order'd the Battel after this manner; his Main Body was made up of Eight Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Auxiliary Foot, and Three Thousand Horse were placed in the Wings, the Legions being set in the Rear before the Camp, for the greater Glory of the Victory, if it could be won without any loss of <hi>Roman</hi> Blood; if otherwise for Succour and Assistance.</p>
            <p>The <hi>British</hi> Army, for the greater shew and Terror, was drawn upon a rising Gound; the first Battalion stood on the Plain, the next a degree higher, as the Hill ascended, the Field rang with the Clattering Noise of Chariots and Horsemen rangeing up and down. <hi>Agricola</hi> perceiving the Enemy exceeded him in numbers, and fearing lest they might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack him in the Front and Flanks at once, stretch'd out his Front in length; and although by that means his Van-guard was somewhat thin, and that many Councelled him to take the Legions into it, yet he stood firm to his first Resolution, and alighting from his Horse, placed himself at the head of the Foot before the Ensigns.</p>

            <p>But the manner of this Battel was not like a loose skirmish of Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but all keeping their Ranks, endeavoured by the weight of their Horses to bear down the Enemy, and now might be seen Chariots with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Drivers, and the affrighted Horses running to and fro, without Riders, overturning all that met them, or thwarted their way.</p>
            <p>But when those <hi>Britains,</hi> who had not yet engaged but on the tops of the Hills despised the paucity of the <hi>Romans,</hi>

Whereupon <hi>Agricola,</hi> because the Summer was far spent, and that no fit Season to divide his Forces; brought them in an entire body into the borders of the <hi>Horesti:</hi> (supposed to be the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Eske-Dale</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi>) where having received Hostages, he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Admiral of his Fleet to Sail round about <hi>Britain</hi>; furnishing him with all things necessary, but the terrour of the Navy was gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whilst he with slow and easie marches, to the end he might strike the greater terrour into the new Conquer'd Nations, arrived at his Winter Quarters, whilst the Navy with prosperous Winds and good Success, safely arrived at the Port <hi>Trutulensis</hi> (supposed by Mr. <hi>Somner,</hi> to be <hi>Richborough,</hi> near <hi>Sandwich</hi>) from whence it had set out, and coasting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the nearest side of <hi>Britain</hi> returned thither again.</p>

            <p>But tho' it is not to our present Design, give me leave to wait on this Great Man to his Grave, and give you <hi>Tacitus</hi>'s last Account of him, since he is so great an Example of Moderation in Prosperity, as well as of Patience under the Slights and Affronts of an insolent Tyrant.</p>

And though, not long after, when absent, he had been accused to <hi>Domitian,</hi> yet he was also acquitted; there being no Crime alledg'd against him, unless it were to have liv'd under a Prince who was an Enemy to all Vertue. Besides, Had those worse sort of all Enemies, Flatterers prevail'd; there happen'd afterwards such Times which would not permit <hi>Agricola</hi>'s Fame to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd, so many Armies being lost in <hi>Germany, Pannonia,</hi> and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, through the Rashness or Cowardice of the Commanders, that <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola</hi> was again desir'd by all Men to command, comparing his Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Experience in War with the Sloth and Cowardice of others. Which Discourses coming often to the Ears of <hi>Domitian,</hi> whilst some of his Freed-men fairly represented his Merits, and others of the worst sort, through Envy and ill Will, as much misrepresenting them, it provoked this Prince, too apt of himself to do evil: So that <hi>Agricola,</hi> by his own Vertues, as well as the Vices of others, was often near Ruin. And though some time after, when the Proconsulship of <hi>Africa</hi> was void by the Death of <hi>Civica</hi> lately slain, the Command of this Province was seemingly offer'd him, whilst some were privately to offer their Assistance in making his Excuse; and others, more bold and open, both persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and also terrifying him, brought him into <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Presence; who being already prepar'd to dissemble, haughtily (though willingly) accepted his Excuses; nay, suffer'd himself to be thank'd for his Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; nor blush'd at his own Envy of so small a Benefit; nor did he so much as bestow upon <hi>Agricola,</hi> who w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that all those whose Custom it is, only to believe things dangerous unlawful, may be convinc'd that great and good Men may often live safe under the worst of Princes; and that Obsequiousness and Modesty, attended with Prudence and Industry, do far exceed all that Glory to which many by violent Courses, but for no publick Benefit to the Commonwealth, and by a too much sought for Fate, have endeavour'd to attain. However, thus much is certain, That not long after this, <hi>Agricola</hi> died, (whether by Poyson, or not, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,) to the common Grief of his Friends, as well as Strangers; and even <hi>Domitian</hi> himself appear'd to be concern'd at his Loss, though he could more easily dissemble his Joy, than Fear. Thus died the famous <hi>Agricola,</hi> who carried the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles to the utmost bounds of <hi>Britain</hi>; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering more Nations than all his Predecessours before had done, and had also subdued <hi>Ireland,</hi> had not the Jealousie of <hi>Domitian</hi> too soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called him: If <hi>Tacitus,</hi> or some other faithful Historian had given us as exact an account of the Actions of these other Lieutenants, that were sent into <hi>Britain,</hi> during the Reign of this Emperour and his Successours, then we might have had a compleat History of those times; But we are now at so great an uncertainty, that we cannot tell, who it was to whom <hi>Agricola</hi> resigned his Command; only we read in <hi>Suetonius</hi> of one <hi>Salustius Lucullus,</hi> to have been Legate of <hi>Britain,</hi> in the days of this Emperour; but nothing can be found of any others or of him,<note place="margin">

            <p>But that there was never any such King, seems to some learned Men very probable; since <hi>Gildas</hi> makes no mention of any such thing; but says the time of <hi>Christ</hi>'s being first Preached in this Island, was as early as the first Conquest of it by the <hi>Romans</hi>; besides which the Monks (who have since new drest up this Story) not only make him to have been King of all <hi>Britain</hi>; but to have settled Christianity in all parts of his Dominions; and instead of <hi>Flamens</hi> and <hi>Arch-Flamens</hi> in the chief Cities, as <hi>London, York,</hi> &amp;c. to have placed the Arch-Bishops and Bishops in their rooms, which is impossible to be true: since the Title of Arch-Bishop was not then known in the Church; nor could <hi>Lucius</hi> settle Christianity all over Britain, which was then either under the power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or else what remained unconquered, was absolutely Heathen and Barbarous at the time of this supposed conversion.</p>

            <p>So this Emperour, though Old and much troubled with the Gout, yet with as great Courage as any Young Man, made this expedition into <hi>Britain</hi>; and taking his Journey for the most part in a Litter, staid long in no place; so that having finished his Journey by Land, and having crossed the Sea sooner than could be expected, he entred <hi>Britain,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Muster'd his Soldiers, and brought great Forces together, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for War: But the Northern <hi>Britains,</hi> daunted with the Report of so great Forces brought over with him, and that more were preparing, sent Ambassadours to treat of Peace, and to excuse their former doings. The Emperour now loath to return home, without some memorable Action, whereby he might assume to his other Titles the addition of <hi>Britannicus,</hi> delay'd his Answer; but quickens his preparations, till in the end, when all things were in a readiness to follow them, they were dismissed without effect; when he arrived, his principal care was to have many Bridges and Causeways laid over Bogs and Moors, that his Souldiers might fight on firm ground, for many parts of <hi>Britain,</hi> were at that time over run with Bogs and Marshes, (as <hi>Ireland</hi> was some Years ago) now the <hi>Britains</hi> used to wade through these Marshes up to the middle, not valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, because they went naked: But <hi>Severus</hi> prepared all things which
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93814:109"/>
might be of any use for the Souldiers, or a damage to the <hi>Britains</hi>:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> CXCVIII.</note> And when he found all were ready to his Mind, having his Younger Son <hi>Geta</hi> to govern the more <hi>Southern</hi> part of the Island, by the help of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinian,</hi> the great Lawyer; taking his Eldest Son <hi>Bassianus</hi> along with himself, he marched against the <hi>Britains,</hi> and having passed the Wall that divided their Territories, there only happen'd some tumultuary Skirmishes, in which thô the <hi>Romans</hi> were still Conquerours, yet the <hi>Britains</hi> found an easie retreat, by hiding themselves in the Woods and Bogs, which were well known to them, which contributed very much to prolong the War. Yet did not <hi>Severus</hi> desist, till he had passed to the very farthest part of the Island, and had compell'd the Enemies to make Peace upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, That they should give up great part of their Territory, although he lost in this Expedition, by the sudden Assaults and Ambushes of the <hi>Britains,</hi> as well as by <hi>Diseases,</hi> near Fifty Thousand Souldiers; which is also confirm'd by <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 76.</note> 
               <hi>Dion,</hi> who further tells us, That he fought no set Battel, nor yet saw any Forces of the Enemies in Battell Array; but that they did often leave their Sheep and Oxen on purpose, that the <hi>Romans</hi> going out of the way to seize them, might be the more easily taken and overcome: besides all this, the want of Water much troubled the <hi>Romans,</hi> and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushes were laid for those that went about stragling to find it: And when they were not able to march any further for want of it, they were killed by their fellow Souldiers, least they should be taken by the Enemy.</p>
            <p>But in this Expedition, the wicked cariage of <hi>Bassianus</hi> gave <hi>Severus</hi> perpetual trouble, not only because he lived debauchedly, but also for that it was evident, as soon as he had Power he would kill his Brother; and had also made some attempts against <hi>Severus</hi> himself; for he ran once all of a sudden out of his Tent, crying out that he was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd by <hi>Castor,</hi> who was the worthiest Man in <hi>Severus</hi>'s Court, and was privy to his most secret Councils, being the chief of his Bed-chamber, (the same with the Lord Chamberlain with us.) Now there were before ready prepared some Soldiers on purpose, who upon <hi>Bassianus</hi>'s thus cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out came to his Assistance, and (as <hi>Herodian</hi> says) proclaim'd him <hi>Augustus</hi>; whereupon <hi>Severus</hi> immediately made himself to be carried to the <hi>Tribunal,</hi> and having order'd all those Officers, and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who had been engaged in this Action, as also his Son (who had taken upon him the Name of <hi>Augustus</hi>) to appear before him, He commanded them all except his Son to be put to Death, when they all begging pardon for their offence, fell down prostrate before him; upon which he pardon'd them, then touching his own Head with his Hand, said, At last you'l find that it is a Man's Head, and not his Feet that Govern; but <hi>Dion</hi> says, he did put some of the most Seditious of them to Death; who also further relates, that at another time when both the Father and the Son were marching together into <hi>Caledonia, Bassianus</hi> did openly endeavour to kill his Father, for as they rode at the head of the Army, the Enemies Forces being in sight, he stopp'd his Horse, and privately drew his Sword, that he might run his Father into the back; which when those perceived who followed them, they presently cryed out, at which <hi>Bassianus</hi> being startled stopt his blow; but <hi>Severus</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon turning about, saw his Sword drawn, yet then said nothing; but returning to the Camp, went into the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> and there called before him his Son (together with <hi>Papinian</hi> and <hi>Castor</hi>) then Commanding the naked Sword to be laid before them, he sharply reproved him, that not

               </q> Thô <hi>Severus</hi> said all this, he did no more to his Son, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he had often blamed <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> that he had not put his Son <hi>Commodus</hi> to Death; but <hi>Severus,</hi> said this only in his passion, for his Son was dearer to him than the good of the Common-wealth, thô by this means he did as good as Sacrifice his Younger Son to the Elder: since he might easily guess what would happen when ever he should die. <hi>Herodian</hi> confirms the same Story, and that though several Grave and Wise Men had perswaded him to put his Son to Death, yet he refused it, too much indulging his paternal Affection.</p>
            <p>The War being thus happily ended, <hi>Severus</hi> in Memory of these Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, caused Coins to be Stamp'd with this Inscription, <hi>Victoria Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannica</hi>: and upon the Frontiers of what he had now Conquer'd, built a Wall cross the Island, from Sea to Sea, which our Author judges to have been the most magnificent of all his undertakings,<note place="margin">

But the former Wall or Trench seems to have been only faced with Stone about Two Foot thick, and then lined within with Earth: there are also divers other Arguments to prove it was the same with <hi>Hadrian</hi>'s there built before, as first the number of Miles, which <hi>Spartianus</hi> hath truly reckon'd to be Eighty; whereas between <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and <hi>Dunbritton</hi> there is not half that distance; but if any shall object that <hi>Eutropius</hi> hath reckon'd the length thereof to be but Thirty Five Miles, and <hi>Aurelius Victor</hi> Thirty two; yet how even this can agree with the distance between the <hi>Friths</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Dunbritton,</hi> let them consider, who maintain this Opinion, since even that will not agree with the distance between those two Rivers; and thô it is true that <hi>Aurelius Victor</hi>

               <hi>Dion</hi> tells us, That his Corps being carried out in great Pomp, and laid upon the Funeral Pile without the Walls of <hi>York,</hi> at a place called to this day <hi>Sever</hi>'s-<hi>Hoe,</hi> or <hi>Sever</hi>'s-<hi>Hill,</hi> the Souldiers rid round it on Horse-back full speed whilst it was burning, his own Sons having first kindled the Fire. <hi>Herodian</hi> gives us a long Description of his Funeral Pile, and of the manner of burning the Body of a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, which being too tedious to be here recited, those who are desirous of reading the Description of this Spectacle, may find it at large in this Author. His Bones being put in an Urn of Porphiry, were carried by his Sons to <hi>Rome,</hi> and placed in the Sepulchre of the <hi>Antonines:</hi> It is also said by <hi>Dion,</hi> That <hi>Severus,</hi> a little before his Death, commanded this Urn to be brought to him, and holding it in his hand to have spoke thus, <hi>Must thou hold him, whom the whole World could not contain? Severus</hi> is described by this Author to have been in his old age Corpulent, but of a strong Constitution, thô much afflicted with the Gout; of a sharp and excellent Wit; a Lover of good Letters, in which, thô he was a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Master, yet was more able to express it by Writing, than Words; grateful towards his Friends; most cruel to his Enemies; diligent in Affairs, but careless of what Men said of him; greedy of Money, which he gathered by all means, yet for that cause alone he never put any Man to Death: He was magnificent in his publick Expences, and built many new Edifices, and repaired the old ones; so that thô he spent vastly, yet he left a great Treasure behind him. But to add somewhat farther from others, he was a great Enemy to Incontinence and Adultery, and made strict Laws against it; and had certainly as great a mixture of good and evil Qualities as ever were found in any one Man: That he was both Perfidious and Cruel, appears by his Dealing with <hi>Albinus,</hi> as also with the Wife and Children of <hi>Niger,</hi> whom, thô innocent, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be put to Death, whilst his own Son, who had attempted upon his Life and Empire, he easily Pardoned; which whether he did out of Love to him, or weariness of Life, as sated with Honour and Power, may be doubted; and if he had been then a young Man, perhaps he would have acted otherwise.

Now when this Priest had lived with him some time, it came to the Ears of the <hi>Roman</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, That this Confessor (who was not yet to be Martyr'd) lay hid in the House of <hi>Alban:</hi> The Governour presently sent Souldiers to find him out, who when they came thither, <hi>Alban</hi> offered himself to them in stead of his Guest, in that very Habit he used to wear; and being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately brought before the Judge, who at that very time was standing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93814:115"/>
at the Altar sacrificing to his Idols:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> CCCIV.</note> when he saw <hi>Alban,</hi> he was highly incensed, because he had voluntarily delivered himself up instead of his guest, so commanding him to be drag'd before the Images of those false <hi>Gods,</hi> he was then worshiping; said thus, <q>For that thou hast rather chosen to conceal a Rebellious, Sacrilegious Fellow, than to deliver him up to my Guards; that as a contemner of the <hi>Gods</hi> he might suffer the punishment due to his Blasphemy; whatsoever torments therefore were due to him, thou thy self shalt endure, if thou persistest in this new Superstition.</q> But <hi>Alban,</hi> who had of his own accord owned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be a Christian, did not at all fear the threats of the President; but plainly told him, that he would not obey his commands (the rest of their Dialogue being somewhat tedious, I omit) but the Judge being thereupon more provoked, told him again, that if he intended to live, he must imediately offer Sacrifice to their <hi>Gods</hi>; which he again not only refused, but also reproved others for so doing, and thereupon was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to most cruel Torments, all which he manfully overcame; and although they did all they could to invent new Tortures for him, yet he endured them all with exquisite patience, till their weariness, not pity made them desist. And here we must bewail our want of a true Story of this good Man's Martyrdom, which the Monks have mixed with so many improbable Circumstances, that it is even nauseous either to read or hear them. But I shall proceed to relate what I find in <hi>Bede,</hi> without passing my word for the truth of the following Miracles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alban</hi> being sentenced to be beheaded, much People flock'd to the place of his Execution; which was on a Hill (afterward called in <hi>English Holm hurst</hi>) to which they were to pass over a River, where a narrow passage admitted of very few a-breast. <hi>Alban</hi> being to follow after all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and perceiving it would be very late before he could attain his desired End, obtained by his Prayers, that the River parting assunder, afforded a free passage for a great many together; this Miracle so wrote upon him, who was appointed to be his Executioner, that he utterly refused the Imployment, desiring rather to suffer himself for him, than to offer him any violence: But another soon took his place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alban</hi> being come to the top of the Hill, where he was to suffer, found himself very dry; when presently by his Prayer, as Spring brake forth at his Feet, to the amasement of all that saw it, except the Executioner, who notwhithstanding the Miracle, struck off his Head; when instantly his own Eyes fell out of his Head, upon the ground, as a just punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his infidelity: and presently after suffer'd also the Convert Executioner above mentioned.</p>
            <p>The body of St. <hi>Alban</hi> was privately buried; That Age not knowing the Vertue of keeping Saints Relicks; but many Years after, <hi>Offa</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> is said to have discovered his Bones, and to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved them into a stately Shrine; where he built a noble Church and Monastery, as shall be particulary shown in its proper place.</p>
            <p>Not long after the Martyrdom of St. <hi>Alban,</hi> suffered also the Priest who converted him, and whose Name <hi>Geoffrey</hi> will have to be <hi>Amphibalus;</hi> thô we had never heard of it at all, but from this Author, that word signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying properly not a Man's name, but a long shag Cloak, which it is supposed that good Man wore: I shall also pass by the Martyrdoms of many other Christians, said to be at <hi>Lichfield,</hi> and <hi>Winchester</hi> and other places, as being of very uncertain credit, having no other Authors, but

            <p>But the Emperors <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and <hi>Maximinian,</hi> having both on the same day (thô in different places) resign'd the Empire to the two <hi>Caesar</hi>'s above-mentioned, and <hi>Constantinus</hi> choosing the <hi>Western</hi> Provinces (whereof <hi>Britain</hi> was one) for his share, came over hither to settle affairs in this Island; and <hi>Eutropius</hi> supposes <hi>Helena</hi> his Wife to have been a <hi>Britain</hi> by Birth; whereupon our <hi>Geoffrey</hi> presumes further, and makes her to have been the Daughter of one King <hi>Coil,</hi> whom he supposes to have suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Asclepiodotus</hi>: But since there is no ground for this fancy in any Authentick Writer, I shall wholly slight it, especially since <hi>Nicephorus</hi> and other <hi>Greek</hi> Historians relate her to be a <hi>Bithynian</hi>; but to return to that which is more to our purpose; it is certain that as soon as <hi>Augustus</hi> was declared,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Constantine</hi> his Son, who came luckily Post from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Boloigne,</hi> just about the time (saith <hi>Eusebius</hi>) when his Father lay Sick upon his Death-bed; where being by him nominated for his Successour,<note place="margin">

I shall leave it as I found it; thô it must be confessed that the learned Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in his <hi>Orig. Britannicae,</hi> Not only from several passages in <hi>Eumenius</hi>'s Panegyrick, but also by other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, hath made it highly probable that <hi>Constantine</hi> was born in <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is more certain, that <hi>Constantine</hi> before his departure hence, seems to have had some Bickerings with the <hi>Britains</hi> in the <hi>Northern</hi> parts of this <hi>Island,</hi> which having in some time composed, he passed again into <hi>Gaul</hi>; where leaving a great Army (many of whom were before raised in <hi>Britain</hi>) he from thence went into <hi>Italy,</hi> and near <hi>Rome</hi> overthrew the Tyrant <hi>Maxentius,</hi> who had seized that City, together with the rest of <hi>Italy</hi>; immediately after which Victory, he declared himself a Christian in the presence of his whole Army, which yet he would not have perhaps ventured to have done, had he not been sure that a considerable Party of his Souldiers had been so before.</p>
            <p>About the Fourth Year after, <hi>Constantine</hi> return'd again into <hi>Britain,</hi> but what he performed here is not left us by any Historian now extant,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Eusebius</hi> tells us in general, That <hi>Constantine</hi> passed over to the <hi>Britains,</hi> (who had it seems then revolted) whom, when he had subdued, he turned his Eyes to those other parts of the World, that he might relieve those that wanted his assistance; which this Author supposes

to be the rest of the Empire then oppressed by <hi>Mercurius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> CCCX.</note> thô all others make him to have been subdued in the very beginning of <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Reign.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Geoffery</hi> (could he be believed) gives us a very plausible account, why <hi>Constantine</hi> came now again into <hi>Britain,</hi> which is to this effect, That <hi>Octavius</hi> Duke of the <hi>Gewisses,</hi> taking advantage of the Emperor's absence had seized upon <hi>Britain</hi> for himself (the circumstances of which I omit, to shorten the Story) as also how one <hi>Trahern</hi> (who is there supposed to be this Emperor's Unkle by the Mother) obtained a great Victory over this <hi>Octavius</hi>; but that upon <hi>Traherns</hi> being kill'd at <hi>Verulam,</hi> by the treachery of a Nobleman of <hi>Octavius</hi>'s Party, he again returned into <hi>Britain,</hi> and making a Confederacy with the <hi>Northern</hi> Nations, renewed the War; whereupon <hi>Constantine</hi> coming upon <hi>Octavius</hi> on the suddain, soon overcame him, yet suffer'd him though Conquer'd still to Reign here as a Tributary to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: But it is not likely <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> would have given so great an encouragement to Rebellion; nay, what is yet more improbable, he makes this <hi>Octavius</hi> to have Govern'd this Island, even to the days of <hi>Gratian</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> which must needs be false; since the Coyns of all those <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, who succeeded between <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Valentinian</hi> are found in this Island; whereas no Coyn or Monument of this <hi>Octavius,</hi> was ever yet to be seen; and further none of the Historians of this Age do mention any such King of <hi>Britain,</hi> as it is likely they would have done, had they known of such a person.</p>
            <p>But this is more likely, that the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> alter'd the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Divisions of <hi>Britain,</hi> by adding to the former Provinces, <hi>viz. Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannica Prima</hi> and <hi>Secunda,</hi>

            <p>But at last, upon the News of such sad and fearful Calamities which then befel <hi>Britain, Theodosius</hi> was chosen for this Province, who resolved to hasten thither with all speed, who being a Man of great Reputation for Martial Actions, and having raised a sufficient number of fresh, youthful Legions and Cohorts, he set forward with much Resolution.</p>

               </note>At this time the <hi>Picts</hi> were divided into two Nations, the <hi>Decalidoniae,</hi> (or rather, as Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> supposes, <hi>Deucaledonii,</hi>) and <hi>Vecturiones,</hi> with whom came also the <hi>Attacotti</hi> (already mentioned,) together with the <hi>Scots,</hi> who roving up and down through divers places did a great deal of mischief; whilst at the same time the neighbouring Coasts of <hi>Gaul</hi> were grievously infested by the <hi>Francks</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> each of them striving (as it were) who should exceed the other in Rapines, Burnings, killing and taking Prisoners. <hi>Theodosius</hi> being sent hither to put a stop to those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions, taking Sea at <hi>Bononia,</hi> (or <hi>Bulloign</hi>) landed at <hi>Rulpiae,</hi> whence, after the arrival of his Forces called by divers Names according to their several Nations and Legions, as the <hi>Batavi, Herculi, Jovii,</hi> and <hi>Victores,</hi> he marched toward <hi>London,</hi> that ancient City, (which was afterwards called <hi>Augusta,</hi>) and dividing his Forces into several Parties, fell upon these Rovers, whilst they marched scattered up and down laden with Booty, so that easily routing them, the Plunder and Captives he quickly recovered; and having restored all to their respective owners, except some small Portion bestowed on the weary Soldiers, he returned to the said City in a triumphant manner; and thô before it laboured under many Difficulties, he hereby restored it to its former Splendour, being

emboldened with this Success to undertake greater Matters;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> CCCLXVIII.</note> entring into a ferious consideration what was further to be done, he found by what he got out of the Prisoners and Fugitives, that the Enemy, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of divers Nations, was too fierce and numerous to be mastered by downright Force, but rather by Stratagems, and sudden Attacks: He first therefore by Promises of Pardon brought most of his own Deserters and Stragglers to return to their Colours; but being himself taken up with divers Cares, he sent for <hi>Civilis</hi> to govern <hi>Britain</hi> as Vice-Praefect, a Man of a sharp Wit, and a strict observer of Justice, with <hi>Dulcitius</hi> a Commander, very famous for his Military Skill.</p>
            <p>Of which Expedition, the same Author gives us this short general Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in another place, That <hi>Theodosius</hi> having by his Industry got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Army of well-disciplined Souldiers, marching from <hi>London,</hi> he extreamly relieved the Calamities of the <hi>Britains,</hi> seizing upon all Places from which he might infest the Enemy, and commanding his common Souldiers nothing which he did not first undertake himself; by which means he performed both the Duties of a valiant Souldier, and a famous Commander, divers Nations being put to flight, who had before been encouraged by Impunity to assault the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories, and repaired the Cities and Castles which had before suffered very much; so that a firm Peace was hereby established for a long time.</p>
            <p>But the Year following, whil'st <hi>Theodosius</hi> was thus employ'd,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> CCCLXIX.</note> there happen'd a horrid Conspiracy, which had like to have proved of danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Consequence, had it not been stifled in its very Birth: For one <hi>Valentinus</hi> of <hi>Pannonia,</hi> a Man of an insolent and unquiet Spirit,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Id. Ibid.</hi>
               </note> being for some great Crime banish'd into <hi>Britain</hi>; this wretch impatient of rest, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived a Plot against <hi>Theodosius,</hi> who was the only Obstacle to his wicked designs; so that considering by what means he might bring them to pass, (his Ambitious desires still encreasing) he excited some Souldiers, and Outlaw'd persons, by promising them both Pardon and Preferment: And now the time drawing near for effecting his Treason, the General being informed thereof, and being now become more bold to take Revenge on the Conspirators, seized them, and delivered them all to <hi>Dulcius</hi> the Prefect to be put to Death; but judging of things future, by that long Military Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, (in which he excelled all others of his time) he forbid any further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the rest of the Plotters, lest many being thereby made afraid, those troubles which had been already compos'd, should be again revived.</p>
            <p>Then falling to the reforming more necessary things, now the danger was over, and that it was evident, good fortune attended all his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, he restored the Cities and Garisons (as we have already said) fortifying the Borders with constant Watches and Guards, which though now recovered, had been formerly given up to the Enemy; so that the <hi>Northern</hi> Province being restored to its former condition, appointing a new Governour over it, he order'd that it should for the future be called <hi>Valentia,</hi> in Honour of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour.</p>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Who thus became King of that part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> called anciently <hi>Albany, North-west</hi> of the Mountains of <hi>Braid-Albain,</hi> though the same Author confesseth it doth not appear whither he obtained these places by the Sword, or by any other right, since none of his Predecessours had any power there before; but the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> being thus united, their first work was to drive out the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> from their Country, and then to Invade the <hi>Roman</hi> Province, which was at that time left destitute of any defence: And so by their incursions they either killed the Common People, or made them Slaves.</p>
            <p>From which supposed return of <hi>Fergus</hi> with his <hi>Scots, Jo. Fordun</hi> begins to date the certain Years of their Kings Reigns, for before that time he confesses he had not found them any where set down; so that it seems he either had not so good Intelligence, or else not so good an Invention as <hi>Hector Boethius,</hi> who hath given us the Succession of Forty Five <hi>Scotish</hi> Kings Reigning in <hi>Britain,</hi> before this <hi>Fergus</hi>; together with the Years of their Reigns, and the exact time when they began; and this he says he had from the writings of <hi>Uteremundus</hi> a <hi>Spanish</hi> Priest, who is reported by him to have writ the History of <hi>Scotland</hi>; as also from one <hi>Cornelius Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernicus,</hi> Authours whom none but himself have seen as I can yet hear of.

            <p>But to return to our History, from which I hope we have not made too long a Digression, since it hath served not only to confute a Mistake in so eelebrated an Historian as <hi>Buchanan,</hi> but also to settle so considerable a Point in Antiquity. I suppose it was to this second departure of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, that <hi>Claudian</hi> designed these Verses in his Poem <hi>De Bello Getico,</hi> when describing the Forces which were mustered together for that VVar, to the General Rendezvous he also mentions who came from this Island.</p>

            <p>But since the Chronology of these Times we are now Treating of is very perplexed and obscure, by reason of the great scarcity of good Authors; and since some Writers place the <hi>Britains</hi> casting off their Subjection to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire immediately after the Death of this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> above-mentioned, and others defer it 20 Years later, give me leave here to subjoyn what the Learned Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> hath said in his above-cited Treatise concerning the time when this great Change hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in this Island,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Dr.</hi> Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> in his Introduction to his <hi>Britannia,</hi> supposes, that <hi>Claudius Rutilius</hi> mentions <hi>Victorinus</hi> as a <hi>Roman</hi> Governour here about that time; but this is very uncertain, when he there only speaks of the taking <hi>Tholouse</hi> by the <hi>Goths,</hi> which was done by <hi>Ataulphus</hi> some time after the Death of <hi>Alaric,</hi> and therefore could not be before the time of <hi>Gratian</hi> and <hi>Constantine.</hi>

Is it not therefore most probable, that the first Supplies of the <hi>Britains</hi> should be sent in the latter end of <hi>Honorius</hi>'s Reign, especially since the learned <hi>Primate</hi> confesseth, that <hi>Honorius</hi> did not in his time recover the Province of <hi>Britain</hi>: and he proves it against <hi>Sabellicus,</hi> from <hi>Procopius</hi>'s Authority, a much more ancient Authour, besides that of <hi>Bede</hi>; so that the single testimony of <hi>Sigebert</hi>; that <hi>Honorius</hi> sent assistance to the <hi>Britains</hi> at the same time that he did to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> (when <hi>Prosper, Idatius,</hi> and <hi>Cassiodore,</hi> who all mention the latter, say not one word of the former) cannot bear down the more weighty Reasons on the other side.</p>
            <p>But it is certain that in this interval between the sending of the two sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, the <hi>Roman</hi> Affairs became so desperate, That the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> CCCCXVIII.</note> as well as <hi>Ethelward</hi> in his <hi>Chronicle,</hi> relates, that now the <hi>Romans</hi> hid their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures in the Earth, or else carried them away with them into <hi>Gaul</hi>; so that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93814:126"/>
it seems most likely during all the rest of the Reign of the Emperour <hi>Honorius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> CCCCXVIII.</note> the <hi>Britains</hi> did no more return to his Obedience; thô notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, they did again endeavour to put themselves under the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, in the time of his Successour <hi>Valentinian</hi> III. as the learned Dr. above cited makes it more than probable in the same place, from divers other Circumstances too long to be here particularly set down.</p>
            <p>So that the second supplies which were sent upon the mighty impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the <hi>Britains,</hi> were in all probability in the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Valentinian</hi> III. after that <hi>Aetius</hi> had somewhat recovered the credit of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in <hi>Gaul</hi>; for after his success there, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Franks,</hi> he had liberty enough to send over a Legion to the assistance of the <hi>Britains,</hi> who were again miserably harassed by the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi>: And at this time it was that <hi>Gildas</hi> saith, the <hi>Romans</hi> upon the sad representations of the <hi>British</hi> Ambassadours, sent them speedy supplies. So far we have been beholding to the learned Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> now Lord Bishop of <hi>Worc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ster</hi>; but if I may interpose my own Opinion, I should assign the sending of these last supplies by the <hi>Romans,</hi> to have been in the Year of our Lord 435; when <hi>Aetius</hi> had good sucess a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Burgundians</hi> in <hi>Gaul:</hi> To which Year also the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals refer the ceasing of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in <hi>Britain</hi>; only the Compiler was mistaken in two things, the first in making <hi>Rome</hi> to have been taken this Year by the <hi>Goths</hi>; the other in supposing the time of the <hi>Romans</hi> ruling here, to be but 470 Years; whereas indeed it was 488 Years, as I shall presently make out.</p>
            <p>So that from this last departure of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legion, (which no doubt was done by the Emperour's express Order,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> CCCCXXXV.</note>) I think, I may very well date the total dereliction of <hi>Britain</hi> by the <hi>Romans</hi>; who now by refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them their protection, left them by the Laws of Nature to provide for, and defend themselves. And from hence I may also date the final period of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in this Island; which had now lasted from <hi>Julius Caesar</hi>'s second landing in <hi>Britain,</hi> in the 53d Year before Christ, to this Year (being the 435th Year after Christ) the space of 488 Years; but if you account from the more absolute Conquest of it by <hi>Claudius,</hi> in the Forty Fourth Year after Christ, it continued but 391 Years.</p>
            <p>But that the <hi>Britains</hi> were at last very unwillingly cut off from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any longer a part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, appears by the last message they sent to <hi>Aetius,</hi> again imploring assistance; which the Emperour not being able to grant, they had no other way left, but to provide for themselves as well as they could; which since it happened after the time that I suppose the <hi>Roman</hi> power to have ceased in this Island, I shall refer the further Relation of it to the next Book.</p>
            <p>But before I conclude this, I shall give you a short account of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Affairs in this Island, in these Two last Centuries; where, after the last Persecution under <hi>Dioclesian, Bede</hi> tells us, the <hi>British</hi> Church enjoyed a perfect Peace, till the <hi>Arrian</hi> Heresie over-ran the whole World, and at last infected this Island, though divided from the rest of it; but though neither <hi>Gildas</hi> nor <hi>Bede</hi> hath set down the Year when this Heresie first began to spread it self here, yet he seems to refer it to the Reign of <hi>Constantius,</hi> when this Pestilent Opinion carried the face of Authority, as having been confirmed in several pretended Councils.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:93814:126"/>But in the beginning of this Century, though the Year be uncertain,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> CCCCXXXV.</note> yet between the Years 402, and 406, <hi>Pelagius</hi> a <hi>British</hi> Monk (whose <hi>Welsh</hi> Name is supposed to have been <hi>Morgan,</hi> as being of the same signification with the <hi>Latin</hi> Name of <hi>Pelagius,</hi>) broached his Heresie,<note place="margin">Vide <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> Ushers <hi>Antiquit.

            </p>
            <p>Nor did this Island remain long free from this <hi>Pelagian</hi> Heresie; for he having (as it is supposed) perverted divers of his Country-men abroad, they afterward returning home, brought it over and dispersed it here, and was especially propagated by one <hi>Agricola,</hi> the Son of <hi>Severian</hi> a <hi>Pelagian</hi> Bishop, (as <hi>Bede</hi> informs us) who farther says,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 17.</note> that the <hi>Britains</hi> when they would by no means receive so perverse a Doctrine, that blasphemes the grace of Christ, nor yet were able by disputing to refute so settled an Errour, they took a safer course, to send for aid in this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual warfare, from the Bishops of <hi>France</hi>; for which cause a great Synod being there assembled, it was proposed, who was most fitting to be sent to succour the true Belief then assaulted; when by the common votes of them all, <hi>Germanus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Auxerre,</hi> and <hi>Lupus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Troyes,</hi> were chosen to go and confirm <hi>Britain</hi> in the Catholick Faith; who, when they had received the command of that Church, passed the Sea, and <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>Nor did these Bishops think this enough; but, as <hi>Bede</hi> further relates from one <hi>Constantius</hi> (who lived within Fifty Years after this was done) they thought fit likewise to confirm their Doctrine by Miracles;<note place="margin">

            <p>I shall pass over the rest of the real or pretended Miracles of these Bishops, though related by <hi>Bede,</hi> as being of less moment, and come to that famous Victory, which he from the same Authours relates, to have been obtained by their means, which was thus; That not long after their coming, the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> made a fierce Invasion upon the <hi>Britains,</hi> who marching out against them, and mistrusting their own Forces, sent to <hi>Germanus</hi> and his Collegue to help them, reposing more confidence in the Spiritual strength of those Two Holy Men, than in their own Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands; so these Bishops being arrived, their presence in the <hi>British</hi> Camp seem'd not less than if a whole Army had come to second them: It was then the time of <hi>Lent,</hi> and the People instructed by the daily Sermons of these Pastors, came flocking to receive Baptism, to which purpose a place in the Camp was made up of Green Boughs like a Church, against the Day of the <hi>Lords</hi> Resurrection; the Army being there Baptized march'd out to Fight, and contemning the Defence of Arms, only expected Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine assistance; the Enemy hearing how they were imploy'd, seem'd assured of the Victory; when <hi>Germanus,</hi> who also had intelligence of their approach, undertook to be their Captain, and riding out with some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Troops, to discover what advantages the place might offer, happen'd on a Valley encompassed with Hills, through which the Enemy was to pass, and placing there an ambush, warned them, that what words they heard him pronounce aloud, the same they should all repeat with an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal shout: the Enemy march'd on securely, and <hi>German</hi> Thrice aloud cryed <hi>Halelujah,</hi> which being answered by the Souldiers, with a sudden noise and clamour, was also much encreased by the Ecchoes from the Neighbouring Hills and Woods; the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> startled hereat, and supposing it the shout of a Mighty Army, flung down their Arms and fled, and for hast many of them were drowned in that River they had newly passed. The Victory thus obtained without fighting, yielded the <hi>Britains</hi> great store of spoil, and procured to Bishop <hi>German</hi> greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Reputation than before: The place of this Fight is reported to have been near a Town called <hi>Guiderac</hi> in the <hi>British</hi> Tongue, but in the <hi>English Mould</hi> in <hi>Flintshire,</hi> and the place is called <hi>Maes German,</hi> that is <hi>German</hi>'s <hi>Field</hi> to this Day: But there are two Objections to be made against the Truth of this Relation. The first is, how the <hi>Britains</hi> could fight against the <hi>Saxons,</hi> before their arrival here under <hi>Aingist,</hi> which was not till above Twenty Years after: Secondly how the <hi>Britains,</hi> who had been Christians for above Three Hundred Years, should need to be new Baptized. To the former of these Objections, Arch-bishop <hi>Usher</hi> in his <hi>Ant. Brit. Ecclesiae,</hi> gives us a satisfactory answer, <hi>viz.</hi> That before the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93814:127"/>
coming in of the <hi>Saxons</hi> to settle here; it appears,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> CCCCXXXV.</note> that they made several Incursions by Sea, as hath been already proved from divers Authorities; and further <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> in the Relation of this story expresly says, That whil'st these Bishops were here, a strong Army of <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> Invaded <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as for the rest of the Miracles and Actions of <hi>Germanus</hi> and <hi>Lupus</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> since they are only related by <hi>Nennius,</hi> and some of our <hi>English</hi> Monks from certain Legends of little or no Credit, as written long after those Times, I shall wholly omit them; only could wish that the Writers of this Story, would have given us as exact a Relation of Civil Affairs in this Island, as they do of those concerning the Religion of this Age, that we might have known what Kings or Governours the <hi>Britains</hi> had, from the time of the last departure of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to the making of <hi>Vortigern</hi> King; the want of which no doubt was a great encouragement to <hi>Geoffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to forge so many Fictitious Princes, during this interval.</p>
            <p>But for the other Objection, it is, I confess, somewhat harder to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd; some Modern Writers suppose, that in that sad Confusion and Corruption of Manners, that happen'd after the departure of the <hi>Romans,</hi> a great many of the <hi>Britains</hi> turned Idolaters, or else (which is most likely) were Christians but in Name, and so had never been Baptized at all till now.</p>
            <p>I shall now conclude with the rest of the Ecclesiastical History of these Times: This Year as our <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals (from <hi>Prosper</hi>'s Chronicle) relate,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> CCCCXXIX.</note> 
               <hi>Palladius</hi> the Bishop was sent by Pope <hi>Coelestine</hi> to the <hi>Scots,</hi> to confirm their Faith, or as <hi>Bede</hi> in his Epitome, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> as well as in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome at the end (under the Year <hi>CCCCXXX.</hi>) expresses it almost in the words of <hi>Prosper,</hi> viz. <hi>Palladius</hi> was sent the first Bishop by the said Pope, to the <hi>Scots</hi> believing in <hi>Christ,</hi> but in one of the <note place="margin">Vide <hi>the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lections in the margin of the</hi> Oxford <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of these Annals. Cap·</hi> 54.</note> Copies of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals (now in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library) it is thus: <hi>This Year</hi> Palladius <hi>was sent by Pope</hi> Coelestine <hi>to Preach Baptism</hi> (i. e. <hi>Christianity to the</hi> Scots), in which it agrees with <hi>Nennius,</hi> who speaking of this matter, says, <q>That this Bishop was first of all sent by the said Pope to convert the <hi>Scots</hi> to Christ: But being hinder'd from God by certain Tempests, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and arrived in <hi>Britain,</hi> and there died in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the <hi>Picts</hi>; in which he is also followed by <hi>Probus</hi> and <hi>Joseline,</hi> in their Lives of S. <hi>Patrick</hi>; who, thô they agree, that <hi>Palladius</hi> was sent to Convert <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet differ from him in the account how he came to fail in his design, laying the fault upon the obstinacy of the <hi>Irish,</hi> who would not receive his Doctrine; but they both agree with <hi>Nennius,</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he left <hi>Ireland,</hi> and dy'd in the confines of the <hi>Picts.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This difference in these Copies hath bred a great dispute between the <hi>English</hi> Antiquaries on the one side, and the <hi>Scotish</hi> Historians and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries on the other; the former supposing from the Authority of <hi>Nennius,</hi> and the above cited Copy of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicle, besides that of the <hi>Irish</hi> Annals, that the <hi>Scots</hi> were not converted to Christianity, till the Year above mention'd, and consequently were not made Christians so early as their Historians relate; which Opinion hath been strenuously asserted by Arch-bishop <hi>Usher,</hi> in his <hi>Britan. Eccles. Antiquitat.</hi> as also by the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> (now Bishop of <hi>Litchfield</hi>) in his Historical account of Church Goverment,<note place="margin">

and been also further improved by the learned

Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> (now Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi>) in his Antiquity of the <hi>British</hi> Churches,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> CCCCXXX.</note> who all conclude, that the <hi>Scots</hi> were converted to Christianity long before their planting in <hi>Britain,</hi> which they suppose not to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd till about the end of the Fifth, or the beginning of the Sixth Century.</p>
            <p>Against which Opinions, though asserted by so many learned Men, Sir <hi>George Mackenzy</hi> (late Lord Advocate of <hi>Scotland</hi>) hath Written two Treatises, which he calls a defence of the Royal-line of <hi>Scotland</hi>; in the former of which written against the said Bishop, as well as the latter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> he alters the state of the Controversie from an Ecclesiastical to a Civil dispute; making it a crime of loese Majesty so much as to question the reality of the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> before <hi>Fergus</hi> the Second; but omitting the Proofs that he produces for the Antiquity of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Kings before that time, as also what he writes for the <hi>Scots</hi> Conversion, as performed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and not in <hi>Ireland</hi>; being beyond the bounds of our History, I shall leave the Reader for his farther satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to peruse those Treatises, if he think fit, being writ with great Wit and Smartness.</p>
            <p>But since I found the time of <hi>Palladius</hi>'s being sent by the Pope to the <hi>Scots,</hi> mentioned not only in <hi>Bede,</hi> but in our <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicles, I could not well omit putting it down; yet without taking upon me positively to determine whither the <hi>Scots</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or those of <hi>Ireland</hi> are there meant; since I confess the Words are Ambiguous, and the Copies differ, as I have already shewed.</p>
            <p>But the Year after <hi>Palladius</hi>'s being sent to the <hi>Scots</hi> (whether in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> or <hi>Scotland</hi>) the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals tell us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> CCCCXXX.</note> that <hi>Patrick was sent by the same Pope</hi> Coelestine, <hi>to Preach Baptism</hi> (i. e, <hi>Christianity) to the</hi> Scots: Although I find in the Notes of — upon <hi>Nennius,</hi> p. 129; a Chronicle noting, Anno Dom. 475, <hi>Venit S. Patricius ad Hiberniam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that these were the <hi>Scots</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> is agreed on by all; yet this Controversie is made more intricate, by what <hi>Ranul. Higden</hi> writes in his <hi>Polychron. (l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 33. <hi>Celestinus Papa misit S. Patricium, ad Hiberni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Convertendam; &amp; Palladium Romanum Diaconum, ad Scotos Converten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos, Anno Scil. Pontificatus sui IX.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And also by what is found in a Manuscript Copy of <hi>Dicetus</hi> thus; <hi>Celestinus Papa ad Scotos Palladium Primum mittit Episcopum; Postquam ad eosdem, ab eodem Celestino, missus est S. Patricius filius Conches Sororis S. Martini Turonensis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For which last Notes I must own my self obliged to the Learned Doctor <hi>Gale</hi>; but on the other side, if the <hi>Scots,</hi> to whom <hi>Palladius</hi> is said to have been sent, were not the same with those in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but the <hi>Scots</hi> than living in <hi>Scotland</hi>; it must then be confessed that the promiscuous use of the Name of <hi>Scotia,</hi> sometimes for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and sometimes for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of <hi>Scoti,</hi> sometimes used by <hi>Bede,</hi> and other Writers of those times for <hi>Irish</hi> Men, and sometimes for Native <hi>Scots,</hi> have so confounded the Histories of both these <hi>Nations,</hi> that no Man without other Circumstances can tell when they mean the one, or the other.</p>
            <p>But since the Ecclesiastical History of <hi>Britain</hi> in these Times is very obscure, and deficient, there being so little to be found concerning it,

Remarkable in this last Age for Piety or Learning: So having given as good an Account as I am able, and as the broken History of those Times will allow, of the Rise and Fall of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in <hi>Britain,</hi> and the State of Affairs, as well Ecclesiastical as Civil, during the space of near 490 Years that the <hi>Romans</hi> had to do here; I shall in the next Book give you a Prospect of the lamentable State of this part of <hi>Britain,</hi> after the departure of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that the <hi>Britains</hi> had set up Princes of their own Nation.</p>

            <head>THE General History OF BRITAIN, NOW CALLED ENGLAND: As well Ecclesiastical, as Civil. BOOK III. From its Desertion by the <hi>Romans,</hi> to the Preaching of <hi>Christianity</hi> by <hi>AUGUSTINE</hi> the <hi>Monk,</hi> being One hundred Sixty two Years.</head>
            <p>BEING now come to the Third Period of this First Volume, it is fit we say somewhat by way of Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction before so great a Change as you will here find to have followed the Desertion of <hi>Britain</hi> by the <hi>Romans:</hi> For with the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire fell also what before were chiefly <hi>Roman,</hi> Learning, Valour, Eloquence and Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and consequently History too, which is but the Product of these; all which at first encreasing by means of the <hi>Roman</hi> Power and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, did also diminish and decline upon its Departure, till it was at last quite extinct by the coming in of the <hi>Pagan Saxons,</hi> and the long cruel Wars they made upon the <hi>Britains,</hi> as you may observe from the barbarous Latin of <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Nennius,</hi> which are the only Authentick <hi>British</hi> Historians that are now extant.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>English Saxons,</hi> they were at first so illiterate, that it is much doubted, whether they had the use of Letters and Writing among them or not, since we have no Histories or <hi>Annals</hi> of their Times elder than their receiving Christianity; for thô there are some few Stones to be found in <hi>England</hi> inscribed with the ancient <hi>Runick</hi> Characters, (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the late <hi>English</hi> Edition of Mr. <hi>Camden</hi>'s <hi>Britannia,</hi>) yet that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93814:130"/>
they are wholly <hi>Danish</hi> Monuments, and made after the time of their Conversion, I need only refer you to the Inscriptions themselves as they are to be found in the said <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> 
               <hi>Britannia,</hi> with the Additions that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; so that it ought not to seem strange, that the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals are so short and obscure in many places, and that the Relations of Things done before the entrance of Christianity among them are contradictory to each other in point of Time, and other Circumstances; since they were only delivered by Memory and Tradition, which must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for a very uncertain Guide in Matters of Fact, as well as of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Nor is this Uncertainty to be found only in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicles, but also in those of the <hi>Britains</hi> of that Age, since from the Reign of King <hi>Vortigern</hi> to that of <hi>Cadwalladar</hi> is indeed the darkest and most confused part of all the <hi>British</hi> or <hi>Welsh</hi> History: Hence it is that we are forced in this Period, not only to make use of Authors who lived long after the Things they treat of were done, but also are otherwise of no great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; such as <hi>Nennius,</hi> and <hi>Geoffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> whom we sometimes make use of for want of those of better Authority. As for the <hi>English Saxon</hi> History, we have nothing more ancient than <hi>Bede,</hi> and the <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicle, which we shall here give you almost entire, since it seems to be writ faithfully as far as it goes, yet being only <hi>Annals,</hi> (extracted out of <hi>Bede</hi> as far as he goes,) they barely relate the Succession of their Kings with their chief Wars and Actions, without expressing the Grounds or Causes of either, or giving us any Account of their particular Laws, and original Constitutions; so that I confess, they cannot prove so Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to Humane Life, as is required of a just History.</p>

In short, both the Wall and the Towns adjoyning to it being deserted, the Inhabitants saved themselves by flight, which yet could not long secure them, for the Enemy pursuing them, a fresh Slaughter quickly followed more bloody than the former; and, which was worse than all the rest, being tormented with Famine, to get Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, they fell upon and robbed each other; for they who came from the North, (as may probably be supposed,) and had fled from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, being unable to pay for their Quarters when they came into the Southern Parts, seized what they could find; from whence rose Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords and Quarrels among them, and thence Civil Wars; for this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>For thô, during this short interval of Peace,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  </note> there succeeded so great a Plenty of all sorts of Provisions that no Man's Memory could paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel, yet was it attended with great Luxury, and all sorts of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness began also to increase, but chiefly Cruelty, together with the Hatred of the Truth, and the Love of Lies, the taking Evil for Good, and the Love of Darkness rather than Light; so that what was pleasing to God, or not pleasing with them, weighed both alike; and the worst side of the Cause most commonly prevailed, whilst all Things were done contrary to the Publick Good and Safety; nay, not only by Secular Men, but even the Clergy (whose Example should have guided others) were grown Vicious and Corrupt, many of them being given to Drunkenness, or swoln with Pride, or else full of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and Contention; indiscreet and incompetent Judges of what in the common Practice of Life was good or evil, lawful or unlawful.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the general Character that <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Bede</hi> give us both of the <hi>British</hi> Clergy and Laity of these Times; from whence we may easily conclude, that People of this temper were not fit to be trusted with the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93814:131"/>
Government of themselves:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> CCCCXLVI.</note> but being more fond of the Name of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, than apprehensive of the Charge of Governing well, they grew heady and violent in their Affairs, and positive in what they understood not, none being more stout and daring in Councels, none so fearful when it came to Action, all pretending to know what ought to be done, yet all drawing back in the Performance. Thus in a short time, when the Heat of Liberty was once spent, and the Enemy daily encreased, they quickly found their old Temper returning upon them, a slavishness of Mind, and slothfulness of Body, then they might have perceived it was not meer Stomach, or a hot and sudden Love of Liberty that could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them; but that Diligence, Wisdom, and a publick Spirit, were still wanting; so that they shrunk by degrees into their former tameness of Mind, and grew as weary of their new-tried Liberty, as they had been of their old Subjection, which made them write those Abject Letters to <hi>Aetius,</hi> but now mentioned.</p>
            <p>What particular Kings or Governours the <hi>Britains</hi> set up after they were set free from the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, is hard to determine, only <hi>Gildas</hi> tells us in general, <q>That Kings were by them anointed, but none of <hi>God</hi>'s anointing, but such as were most cruel, who were soon after as inconsiderately laid aside without any Examination of the Truth, whilst some were put to Death by their Anointers, to set up others more Fierce and Tyrannical, but if any of them seemed Milder, and more inclined to the Truth, against him as the Subverter of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the general Hatred of all Men was presently directed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So that the Office of a King seems to have been a very dangerous Employment in those wicked and turbulent Times, thô by what we can guess by <hi>Gildas</hi>'s Epistle setting forth the Faults of all Orders and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Men, there had been divers Kings ruling in <hi>Britain</hi> at once, not only in his own, but in former Times, but who they were, he does not particularly mention.</p>
            <p>But to fill up this Interval, <hi>Geoffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> furnisheth us with one <hi>Constantine,</hi> Brother of <hi>Adroenus</hi> King of <hi>Armorica.</hi> This <hi>Constantine</hi> he makes to have been elected King, and crowned at <hi>Cirencester,</hi> and being killed by a <hi>Pict,</hi> was succeeded by his eldest Son <hi>Constans,</hi> who from a Monk at <hi>Winchester,</hi> was made King; and that he being made away by the Procurement of <hi>Vortigern,</hi> he caused himself, being at that time Consul or Count of the <hi>Gevises,</hi> to be elected King in his room; but if you please to look back into the former Book, you will there find how <hi>Constantine</hi> the Usurper, with his Son <hi>Constans</hi> the Monk, the one being made Emperour, and the other Caesar, perished in <hi>France,</hi> may easily confute the falshood of this Story.</p>
            <p>But since neither <hi>Gildas, Nennius,</hi> nor any other <hi>British</hi> Historian, make mention of this <hi>Constantine</hi> or his Son, all that we can conclude to be true in this Relation,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>An. Dom.</hi> CCCCXLV. CCCCXLVII.</note> is, That the <hi>Britains</hi> about this time finding themselves quite deserted by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and being now without any Head, and hard pressed by the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> chose this <hi>Vortigern,</hi> being then a popular Man, (thô he proved neither Wise, Valiant, nor Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,) for their King; in the beginning of whose Reign God was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to purge his Family, (as <hi>Gildas</hi> words it;) the <hi>Britains</hi> not being amended with so many Corrections, were again frighted with a fresh Rumour, that the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> were returning with greater Forces than ever, and that they threatned the Destruction of the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93814:131"/>
and intended no less than to plant themselves from one end thereof to the other; but before their arrival,<note place="margin">

            <p>But before I proceed further in this History, 'tis fit we should give some account of the Name, Original, and Manners of this Great and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Nation of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> whose Posterity enjoy this Kingdom to this very day.</p>

               <hi>Bede</hi> in the first place tells us, that these People came from Three Valiant Nations of <hi>Germany, viz.</hi> the <hi>Saxons, Angles,</hi> and <hi>Jutes</hi>; from which latter were derived the <hi>Kentish</hi> Men, and the Inhabitants of the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and of the Province lying over against the said Isle, (now called <hi>Hampshire</hi>) and which was afterwards part of the Kingdom of the <hi>West Saxons,</hi> was also Peopled by the same Nation. From the <hi>Saxons</hi> (that is the Country which was then called old <hi>Saxony</hi>) came the <hi>East Saxons, South Saxons,</hi> and <hi>West Saxons,</hi> and from the <hi>Angles,</hi> that is, that Country which is called <hi>Angulus,</hi> and which lyes between the Countries of the <hi>Jutes</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> are derived the <hi>East Angles,</hi> the <hi>Middleland Angles,</hi> or <hi>Mercians,</hi> together with the whole Nation of the <hi>Northumbrians,</hi> that is, those <hi>Northern</hi> People which live beyond the River <hi>Humber,</hi> so far <hi>Bede</hi>: But <hi>Ethelwerd,</hi> one of our most ancient Historians in his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle, tells us more plainly, that Old <hi>England</hi> is feared between the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and the <hi>Jutes,</hi> having for its Capital City that which is called in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue <hi>Sleswic,</hi> but by the <hi>Danes Heathaby,</hi> and that <hi>Britain</hi> taking its Name from its Conquerors, is now called <hi>England.</hi>

               <hi>Saffridus,</hi> in his Treatise <hi>De Origine Frisiorum,</hi> tells us, had as many denominations with the Name of <hi>Angli</hi> added to them, as there were Countries into which they were dispersed, and there reckons up a great many; and though this Nation was not at first the same with that of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> nor dwelt in the same <hi>Inland</hi> Country, in which they are placed by <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> yet they might, according to the ancient custom of the <hi>Germans,</hi> change their seats after <hi>Ptolemies</hi> Time (as <hi>Strabo</hi> observes they often did) and so removing their dwellings from the Banks of the <hi>Elbi</hi> into <hi>Holstein,</hi> they might be there conquered by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and after make up one Nation or Common-wealth with them, though still retaining their ancient Name, as the ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> or <hi>Welsh,</hi> do among us at this day; so that I confess it remains a great doubt, why they were at first called <hi>Angles</hi>; for thô most Writers think it sufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their Name from the <hi>Latin</hi> Word <hi>Angulus</hi> a corner, because forsooth they lived in a corner of <hi>Germany,</hi> yet this seems very forced, since <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy</hi> mention them by that Name, as then well known and given them a long time before they came to be so called by the <hi>Romans</hi>; so that I still believe that this Name may be derived from some <hi>Gothic</hi> Original, though what it was, is now hard to determine.</p>
            <p>As for the name of <hi>Saxons</hi> in general, there is a great dispute about it amongst learned Men; <hi>Goropius Becanus,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> from him, suppose them to have been first called <hi>Sacaesons,</hi> i. e. the Sons or Posterity

                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> CCCCXLIX.</note> from whom he imagins them to be derived; but this Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology is proved by Mr. <hi>Sherringham,</hi> in his said Discertation, not only to be forced, but also false in matter of Fact; for first the name of these People was never written, or pronounced <hi>Sacasons</hi> in the <hi>Plural,</hi> but <hi>Sacen</hi> or <hi>Saxons,</hi> nor can we find in <hi>Strabo, Ptolemy,</hi> or any other ancient Authour, that ever the <hi>Sacae</hi> sent any <hi>Colonies</hi> out of <hi>Asia,</hi> where they were planted near the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, not far from <hi>Bactria</hi>; but <hi>Strabo</hi> tells us to the contrary, that this whole Nation being set upon by the <hi>Persians</hi> at unawares, were totally destroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Isidore</hi> hath found out another derivation of this Name, from the Latin Word <hi>Saxum</hi> a Stone, or Rock, because they were a strong and hardy Race of Men, excelling all others in piracy; which were not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, if this Name could be proved to have been first given them by the <hi>Romans</hi>; whereas this Nation was so called by their Neighbours (thô not by themselves) many Ages before the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> had any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them; so that the most likely <hi>Etymology</hi> of this Name, seems to be that which <hi>Verstegan</hi> hath given us in his said Treatise, from the Opinion of the learned <hi>Lipsius,</hi> that it was first given them by their Neighbours, from their wearing a sort of long Daggers, or short crooked Swords, like Cymeters, called in their Tongue <hi>Saexen,</hi> and whence from their particular use of it, they were called <hi>Saxons,</hi> and in the <hi>Dutch, Welsh</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Tongues, the <hi>English</hi> are called <hi>Sacen</hi> to this day; and from whence probably the Arms of <hi>Saxony</hi> are two such crooked Daggers, placed Saltire-wise, as <hi>Pontanus</hi> hath very well observed.</p>
            <p>But whencesoever this name is derived, it is certain they are first mentioned by <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> by the Name of <hi>Saxons,</hi> and he places them at the back of the <hi>Cimbrians</hi>; thô they were not commonly known to the <hi>Romans</hi> by this Name, till the Fourth Century after Christ, when they grew terrible by reason of their many Piracies; <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> and <hi>Claudian</hi> the Poet, (whose Verses concerning them, I have given you in the former Book,) being the first <hi>Roman</hi> Authours, who make mention of them; and the latter says, that the <hi>Saxons</hi> are formidable above all other Enemies. After him, <hi>Orosius</hi> says, The <hi>Saxons</hi> were terrible, by reason of their Valour; but in the Time of the Emperour <hi>Theodosius,</hi> I. they were grown so formidable, that there were Ships and Watch-houses appointed on purpose in the Coast of <hi>Britain</hi> to hinder their depredations, and the Commander over them was called <hi>Comes littoris Saxonici,</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ndus,</hi> accused at <hi>Rome</hi> of Treason, in the time of <hi>Anthemius,</hi> for persuading the King of the <hi>Goths</hi> to make War upon the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour, (i. e. <hi>Anthemius,</hi>) who then came out of <hi>Greece:</hi> And upon the <hi>Britains</hi> on the <hi>Loir,</hi> as <hi>Sidonius Appolinaris</hi> expresly affirms, who lived at that time, and pitied his Case. This hapned about <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 467, before <hi>Anthemius</hi> was the second time Consul; from whence it appears not only that there were <hi>Britains</hi> then setled on the <hi>Loir,</hi> but that their Strength and Forces were considerable, which cannot be supposed to consist of such miserable People as only fled from hence for fear of the <hi>Saxons</hi>; (and not being able to keep their own Country, it is not likely they could that of others:) And it is farther ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, that about this time <hi>Aurelius Ambrosius</hi> had success against the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and either by <hi>Vortimer</hi>'s Means, or his, the <hi>Britains</hi> were in great likelihood of driving them quite out of <hi>Britain</hi>; so that there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, that the Warlike <hi>Britains</hi> should at that time leave their native Country. A second Passage is concerning <hi>Riothamus,</hi> a King of these <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morian Britains,</hi> in the time of <hi>Sidonius Appollinaris,</hi> (and to whom he wrote,) who went with 12000 <hi>Britains</hi> to assist the <hi>Romans</hi> against <hi>Euricus</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> but were intercepted by him, as <hi>Jornandes</hi> relates the Story; and <hi>Sigibert</hi> places it <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 470: Now, What clearer Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can be desired than this, to prove, that a considerable number of <hi>Britains</hi> were there setled, and in a condition not only to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but to assist the <hi>Romans?</hi> which cannot be imagined of such as meerly fled thither for Refuge after the <hi>Saxons</hi> coming into <hi>Britain.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, we find in <hi>Sirmondus</hi>'s <hi>Gallican</hi> Councils, <hi>Mansuetus,</hi> a Bishop of the <hi>Britains,</hi> subscribing to the first Council at <hi>Tours,</hi> which was held <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 461, by which we see the <hi>Britains</hi> had so full a Settlement then, as not only to have Inhabitants, but a King and Bishops of their own; which was the great Encouragement for other <hi>Britains</hi> to go over, when they found themselves so hard press'd by the <hi>Saxons</hi> at home: For a People frighted from hence would hardly have ventured into a Foreign Country, unless they had been secure before hand of a kind Reception there; And if they must have fought for a Dwelling, had they not far better have done it in their own Country? From whence I conclude, that there was a large Colony of <hi>Britains</hi> in <hi>Armorica,</hi> before those Numbers went over upon the <hi>Saxon</hi> Cruelties, of which <hi>Eginhardus,</hi> and other Foreign Historians speak: Though how it should come to be setled there, unless some Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were carried over before by <hi>Maximus,</hi> or <hi>Constantine,</hi> the last Usurper of the Empire, I know not, but as for this, it being very obscure, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine nothing.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Nennius</hi> saith little more than that <hi>Vortigern</hi> was afraid of him; and then immediately he confounds himself with <hi>Merlin,</hi> who being a Boy, tells <hi>Vortigern,</hi> (after the Story of his being born without a Father,) That he had concealed his Father's Name out of fear, but that he was one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Consuls; whereupon <hi>Vortigern</hi> gave him a Castle, together with all the Western Parts of <hi>Britain,</hi> which is as true as being born without a Father. But if <hi>Geoffery</hi> were to be believed, he tells us very plainly, That he was one of the Sons of <hi>Constantine</hi> King of <hi>Britain,</hi> who was forced to fly from <hi>Vortigern</hi> after the murder of their Brother <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stans</hi> by his contrivance: but we know that <hi>Constantine,</hi> and his Sons <hi>Constans</hi> and <hi>Julian,</hi> were killed abroad many Years before; and it is not probable the <hi>Romans</hi> would have permitted any one of his Sons to have remained here; or if they did, this <hi>Ambrosius</hi> must have been by this time near 60 Years of Age, supposing him to have been but One Year old when his Father died.

               <hi>Cerdic</hi> and <hi>Cynric</hi> slew the great <hi>British</hi> King, <hi>Natanleod</hi> or <hi>Nazaleod,</hi> together with 5000 Men, from which time that Province is called <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanleage,</hi> as far as <hi>Cerdicsford</hi>; but <hi>H.

            </p>
            <p>But to make some Reflections upon this Story, before we proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is worth our enquiry, who this <hi>Nazaleod</hi> was; some think him to be <hi>Ambrosius</hi> aboved mentioned, but others take him for his pretended Brother <hi>Uther Pendragon,</hi> whil'st others again suppose him not to be any King at all, but only the General of the King of the <hi>Britains,</hi> thô what King that was, remains as uncertain, and since it is so much in the dark, I shall not undertake to determine it.</p>
            <p>It is also as uncertain who now succeeded this <hi>Nazaleod</hi>; most of the <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Those Annals at the end of</hi> Dooms-<hi>Day Book in the Exchequ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So likewise, whether he was sole King of the <hi>Britains</hi> is much questioned; since some ancient Manuscripts, <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicles and Poems, make him to have been only King of <hi>Cornwall.</hi> As to his Father, Arch-bishop <hi>Usher</hi> very well conjectures, that this <hi>Uther,</hi> who is said to have been his Father, was no other than <hi>Nazaleod</hi> above mentioned; who for his great Actions was called in <hi>Welsh, Uther,</hi> which signifies as much as Wonderful or Terrible; and thus (as <hi>Nennius</hi> tells us) <hi>Artur</hi> (whose name signifies in <hi>Welsh</hi> an horrible bear) was also called <hi>Mabuter,</hi> that is a horrible Son, because in his Childhood he was very cruel, or rather because he was the Son of this <hi>Nazaleod,</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Uther:</hi> out of which <hi>Geoffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> forged the Name of <hi>Uter Pendragon</hi>; if this could be proved, as it is an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conjecture of the learned Lord Primate, it would go a great way to clear the <hi>British</hi> History of these obscure times: But since we are now treating of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> and that it is certain he gained many consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Victories over the <hi>Saxons,</hi> thô the particular Years are not set down by <hi>Nennius,</hi> or any other Author; I shall here set them down altogether as they are found in <hi>Nennius</hi>; his first Battle was fought near the Mouth of the River, which is called <hi>Glein</hi> or <hi>Gleni</hi> (which is supposed by some to have been in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> but by others (and that more likely) to have been <hi>Glein</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire</hi>): the Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Battels were near another River called <hi>Dugl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, That thô <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> and <hi>H. Huntington</hi> both make mention of this <hi>Arthur,</hi> and his Victories over the <hi>Saxons,</hi> yet that the latter took all he has written concerning him from <hi>Nennius,</hi> as the former did either from him, or else from some Monkish Legends in the Abby of <hi>Glastenbury</hi>; and that he knew no more of this <hi>Arthur</hi> above 500 Years ago, when he wrote his History, than we do at this day. Lastly, That the pretended History of <hi>Geoff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DXX.</note> but in <hi>France, Scotland, Ireland, Norway,</hi> and other Countries, as are sufficient to shock the Credit of his whole History: It being a likely matter, that he, who could not maintain his own Country, should have Forces and Leisure sufficient to conquer the Kingdoms of so many Foreign Princes.</p>
            <p>To each of which Objections we shall return these Answers. That in the first place, as to <hi>Gildas</hi> his not mentioning him, it is at the best but a Negative Argument, since it is evident that he did not design any exact History of the Affairs of his Country, but only to give a short Account of the Causes of the Ruine of it by the <hi>Scots, Picts,</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> the chief of which he ascribes to GOD's Vengeance upon the <hi>Britains</hi> for their great Wickedness, and corruption of Manners; nor does he mention any Kings or Commanders of those Times, except <hi>Vortigern,</hi> and <hi>Aurelius Ambrosius.</hi> As for <hi>Nennius,</hi> thô what is objected against him be true, yet since he lived near 300 Years after <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Death, (as appears by the Preface to his History,) it is highly probable he set down what he there wrote, if not from some other more ancient Writers, yet at the least from the general Tradition of his Country-men at that time, who can never be supposed to have been able to forge this whole Story of K. <hi>Arthur,</hi> and the Battles he fought; and thô it be true, that the <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> make no mention of this King, yet if these were also written from Traditions long after these Things were done, being not put into the Form we now have them till long after the <hi>Saxons</hi> became <hi>Christians,</hi> it is no wonder if there be no mention made of him; especially since they could not do it without Recording to Posterity the many Defeats he gave them; but notwithstanding this, divers of our best and most ancient, <hi>English</hi> Historians, as <hi>Radulphus de Diceto,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Rudburn,</hi> do menti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n King <hi>Cerdio</hi>'s fighting divers Battles with King <hi>Arthur.</hi> But as for <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> and <hi>H. Huntington,</hi> thô it might be true, they neither of them knew any thing of them, but what they had from <hi>Nen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> or the Legends of <hi>Glastenbury</hi>; yet are not the ancient Registers of that Monastery to be wholly slighted as false, since King <hi>Arthur</hi> was there buried: But <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> in his Book of the Antiquities of that Church, makes King <hi>Arthur</hi> to have begun his Reign over the <hi>Britains</hi> in the Tenth Year of King <hi>Cerdic,</hi> in which he is also followed by <hi>Ran. Higden</hi> in <hi>Polychronicon,</hi> and <hi>Joh. Tinmuth</hi> in his <hi>Golden History</hi>; and thô the Tomb of King <hi>Arthur</hi> was not found in the time of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> yet was it some Years after discovered, about the end of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, as <hi>Giraldus Cambrensis</hi> relates at large, both in his Book <hi>De Institutione Principis,</hi> and in his <hi>Speculo Ecclesiastico</hi>; where he gives a large Account of the manner of finding his Coffin, (which was made out of a solid Oak,) as also of the largeness of his Bones which he saw and handled; together with an Inscription upon a Leaden Cross of about a Foot long, fixed to the lower side of a broad Stone laid three Foot above the Coffin, on which was inscribed this Epitaph, <hi>Hic jacet sepultus inclytus. Rex Arthurus in Insula Aualonia</hi>; which Cross being preserved in the Monastery of <hi>Glastenbury</hi> till <hi>Leland</hi>'s time, he saw and took a Copy of it,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>But as for the last Objection, thô it be true what <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> very well observes, that the <hi>Britains</hi> had vented a great many Fables of him, yet he still acknowledges him to have been a Prince more worthy to

                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DXLIV.</note> King <hi>Constantine</hi> being supposed by <hi>Geoffery</hi> to have died about this time, he makes his Nephew <hi>Aurelius Conan</hi> to have succeeded him, who Reigning about two Years, was followed by <hi>Vortipore</hi>; who also dying four Years after, was suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by <hi>Malgo,</hi> (called by <hi>Gildas, Malgoclunus,</hi>) and is supposed to be the same with <hi>Maelgwn Guined,</hi> (so often mentioned in the <hi>Welsh</hi> Annals;) so that according to <hi>Geoffery,</hi> these three Princes reigned successively after one another, which can by no means to reconciled with <hi>Gildas</hi>'s Epistle, who speaks to all of them, as living and reigning at one and the same time; so that it is most likely that <hi>Malgo,</hi> or <hi>Malgocunus,</hi> was only King of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> or else of the Northern Parts of <hi>Britain,</hi> (as some of the <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicles affirm;) but that <hi>Vortipore</hi> was King of that part of <hi>South-Wales</hi> called <hi>Demetia, Gildas</hi> himself relates, whilst <hi>Aurelius Conan</hi> ruled in <hi>Powis</hi> Land, or some other Southern Province, (as Arch-Bishop <hi>Usher</hi> with preat probability supposes;) but <hi>Gildas</hi>'s Epistle, wherein he so sharply inveighs against all these <hi>British</hi> Kings above-mentioned, is to this effect.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Britain</hi> has Kings, yet Tyrants; it has Judges, but preying upon, and oppressing the Innocent; their Kings have Wives of their own, yet are Whoremongers; often Swearing, yet as often Perjuring themselves; often making Wars, but those unjust, or Civil Ones; prosecuting Thieves, yet having the greatest near them, even at their own Tables; sitting in the Seat of Justice, yet not observing the Rules of right Judgment; despising the Innocent and Peaceable, and countenancing the Bloody and Adulterous; keeping Men in Prison, whom they have put there rather out of Malice, than Desert.</q> And then proceeds par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to all the Kings then reigning, beginning with <hi>Constantine,</hi> whom he calls <hi>The Tyrannical Whelp</hi> of an impure <hi>Damonian Lioness</hi>; and accuses him this very Year, in which he wrote that Letter, to have been guilty of murdering two innocent Youths of Royal Blood at the very Altar, and under the Cope of the holy Abbot: (These are supposed to have been the two Sons of <hi>Mordred.</hi>) He likewise accuses this Prince, that being polluted with frequent Adulteries, he had, contrary to Christ's Precept, put away his own Wife.</p>
            <p>In the next place, applying himself to <hi>Aurelius Conan,</hi> he accuses him of the like, if not worse Parricides, besides Fornications and Adulteries; and that hateing the Peace of his Country, he had out of desire of Prey fomented Civil Wars.</p>
            <p>In the third place he comes to <hi>Vortipore,</hi> whom he calls <hi>The wicked Son</hi> of a <hi>good Father,</hi> and <hi>Tyrant</hi> of the <hi>Demetae,</hi> (that is, <hi>South-Welshmen</hi>) and whom he accuses of the like Faults; and that thô his Head were then grey, yet he was guilty of Adultery, his Wife being put away; him he also advises to Repentance.</p>
            <p>Next he proceeds to <hi>Cuneglasus,</hi> (who is supposed by some Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to have been King of the <hi>Northern</hi> or <hi>Cambrian Britains</hi>;) but this is to be observed, that <hi>Geoffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> takes no notice of him; which shews, that either he never saw this Copy of <hi>Gildas,</hi> or else, if he did, knew not where to place this Prince; having already made as many Kings to succeed each other, as the Time he had to bestow upon them would allow: But whoever he was, <hi>Gildas</hi> accuses him for fighting both against GOD and Men; against Men, by taking Arms against his own Country-men; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, by infinite Wickedness; and besides his other Faults, that having
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93814:143"/>
put away his own Wife,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DXLIV.</note> he had married her Cousin who had vowed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Chastity.</p>
            <p>Then he concludes with a sharp Reproof of <hi>Maglocunus,</hi> whom he calls the Island <hi>Dragon,</hi> and the Expeller of many other Tyrants; he also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses him of Sodomy, asking him, Why, being taller in Stature, and greater in Power than all the rest of the Princes in <hi>Britain,</hi> he had made himself, in stead of being better, far worse than they? Upbraiding him, that in his Youth he had murdered the King his Uncle, with many of his Men. After many other Reproofs, threatens him with speedy Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unless he repent.</p>
            <p>This is the Substance of <hi>Gildas</hi>'s Reproof to the <hi>British</hi> Princes; from which all that we can gather is, First, that there were no less than five Kings at this time in <hi>Britain,</hi> thô by what Means or Title they came to the Crown is uncertain; more than that it seems probable, some of these Princes here mentioned were descended from <hi>Aurelius Ambrosius</hi>; thô (as <hi>Gildas</hi> observes) highly degenerated from the Virtue of their Ancestors: But what great Actions these Kings did during their Reigns, or what good Qualities they were indued with, is not known, so that there is but a slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Account of them in the Rolls of Fame; which may make us suspect they were guilty of but very few good Qualities, because we here find a large Catalogue of their bad Ones. Who succeeded each of these Kings in their distinct Territories, the most authentick <hi>British</hi> Chronicles do not mention; and therefore, thô <hi>Geoffery</hi> makes one <hi>Careticus</hi> to have now gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that part of <hi>Britain</hi> which was still left unconquered by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and whom he will have to succeed <hi>Malgo</hi>; and that thereupon the <hi>Saxons</hi> sent for one <hi>Gormund</hi> an <hi>African</hi> King with a great Army of his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who making a League with the <hi>Saxons,</hi> set upon <hi>Careticus,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged him in the City of <hi>Circester,</hi> and taking and burning it, afterwards fought with <hi>Careticus,</hi> and forced him to flie beyond the Mountains of <hi>Wales</hi>: Yet since neither in our <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals, nor any other good Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian, there is any thing to be found concerning these Kings, or any <hi>Africans</hi> that ever invaded <hi>Britain,</hi> it is to be looked upon as no better than one of the bold Inventions of this Author.</p>
            <p>But as I have given you <hi>Gildas</hi>'s Character of their Kings, so I shall now give you that of their Clergy, whom he thus reproves. <hi>Britain</hi> (says he) <hi>hath Bishops, but without Discretion; many Ministers, but those Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent; many Clerks, but subtle Prowlers; Pastors in Name, but indeed Wolves; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then <hi>Bede,</hi> after giving us a short Description of this Island and Monastery,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>From the above-mentioned Passage in <hi>Bede,</hi> some Writers have inferr'd, That Bishops were not then thought so necessary, since the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was able to subsist so long without them; and the Abbot of <hi>Hy,</hi> without being ordained Bishop, exercised Episcopal Authority over those that were Bishops; to which, Arch-Bishop <hi>Usher</hi> in his before-cited Work, <hi>De Britan.

Which Words of <hi>Columba</hi> a Presbyter to a Bishop, are supposed sufficiently to shew, that he acknowledged the Episcopal Order superiour to his own; and that the <hi>Scots</hi> ever acknowledged, that Bishops were necessary for the Ordaining of others in the Ministery, the said Bishop further urges from <hi>Bede,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 3.</note> who there tells us, <q>There was a Bishop of all that Province; as also from another place in the said Author, where he relates, That when King <hi>Oswald</hi> becoming a Christian, desired to have a Bishop from <hi>Hy.</hi> to plant a Church among his <hi>Northumbrians; Aidan</hi> was sent to him, having first received the Degree of a Bishop, in the time when <hi>Segenius,</hi> Abbot and Priest, was over that Monastery; and also, that after he came into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> he chose the Place for his Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal See in the Isle of <hi>Lindisfarn,</hi> where he was with his Clergy; and there he was Abbot with his Monks, who all belong to the Care of the Bishop, where he was also succeeded by divers other Bishops; till that Church being destroyed by the <hi>Danes,</hi> the Bishop's See was remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to <hi>Durham.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This year, as the <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicle, called <hi>Triades,</hi> relates (being an Ancient Manuscript written near 1000 years ago), the Battel of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derydd</hi> was fought on the Borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> between <hi>Aeddan Vradog, (i. e.</hi> the Treacherous) and <hi>Guendelew</hi> Son of <hi>Keidiaw, British</hi> Princes of the North Parts of <hi>Britain,</hi> on the one side; and <hi>Reiderch-hoel, (i. e.</hi> the Liberal) a <hi>British</hi> King of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> on the other side, and that upon a very slight occasion, a Lark's-Nest, and two Dogs: In which Battel <hi>Guendelew</hi> was slain, though his men fought and skirmish'd with the other <hi>Britains</hi> for Six Weeks to revenge his Death. After which Fight <hi>Aedan</hi> being there overcome, fled into the Isle of <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like Story is related by <hi>Hector Boethius,</hi> concerning the Battel between <hi>Aedan</hi> King of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the <hi>Picts,</hi> upon the like occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so that either the <hi>Scots</hi> borrowed it from the <hi>British</hi> History, or else this had it from them; though the former be the most likely. But how this can agree with our <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals, who make <hi>Adda</hi> King of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia</hi> to have died Ten Years before, I know not; one of them must certainly be mistaken, since there was but one King of <hi>Northumberland</hi> who was called <hi>Adda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This year, or the next, King <hi>Freothwulf</hi> dying, <hi>Theodoric</hi> the Son of <hi>Ida</hi> (according to <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Matth. Westminster)</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in the Kingdom of <hi>Bernicia, Aella</hi> still reigning in <hi>Deira.</hi> This <hi>Theodoric</hi> and his Sons (according to the Ancient Author of the <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Genealogies at the end of <hi>Nennius,</hi> lately put forth by Dr. <hi>Gale)</hi> fought with <hi>Vrbgen,</hi> or <hi>Vrien,</hi> King of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and his Sons, with various Success, who besieged <hi>Theodoric</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,</hi> (now <hi>Turne</hi> Island) until by the means of <hi>Morgant,</hi> a Prince of the same Countrey who envied his Valour, <hi>Vrien</hi> was in that Expedition murthered by his own men: But the Succession of these Kings of <hi>Northumberland</hi> is very obscure and uncertain.</p>
            <p>For the Author of the abovecited Genealogies makes one <hi>Freodguald</hi> to have succeeded this <hi>Theodoric</hi> or <hi>Deoric</hi> (as he calls him); but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was the same with <hi>Freothwulf,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Florence,</hi> is hard to determine; and after this <hi>Freodguald,</hi> who reigned seven years, one <hi>Hussa</hi> is said to have succeeded, who reigned seven years likewise; but whether in <hi>Deira</hi> or <hi>Bernicia,</hi> he does not say; in which he is also fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by <hi>Rog. Hoveden,</hi> in his Prologue to his History; but the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of these Kings having no certain Time assigned them, I can only set them down as I find them. Here is a large Gap left in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals, where nothing occurs further of <hi>English</hi> Affairs for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years. To supply which, we must have recourse to the <hi>British</hi> Affairs in those Countries we now call <hi>Wales.</hi> Where (to shew you the Uncertainty of the <hi>British</hi> Chronology),</p>

            <p>After the <hi>Saxons</hi> had obtained the Kingdom and Crown of <hi>London</hi> upon the Expulsion of the <hi>Britains,</hi> all the People of <hi>Wales</hi> met at the mouth of the River <hi>Dee</hi> to Elect a King; and thither came the men of <hi>Gwineth</hi> (or <hi>North-Wales),</hi> the men of <hi>Powis-land,</hi> the men of <hi>Dehau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barth, Glamorgan,</hi> and divers other Countries; who all elected <hi>Mael Gwineth</hi> King:</p>
            <p>Whom <hi>Geoffry</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> fables to have been King not only of all this Island, but also to have conquered <hi>Ireland, Iceland, Gothland, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, Denmark,</hi> and the <hi>Orcades</hi>; a story so ridiculous, that the very telling it is a sufficient Confutation: And all this he collects from those words of <hi>Gildas,</hi> wherein he calls him the <hi>Island-Dragon,</hi> and a driver out of many Tyrants; and because to express his great wickedness he says, <hi>He was drunk with the Wine of</hi> Sodom; <hi>Geoffry</hi> will needs conclude him to have been guilty of <hi>Sodomy.</hi> This Prince is supposed to have reigned as Supreme King of <hi>Wales</hi> about six years.</p>

               <hi>Ceawlin</hi> King of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Cutha,</hi>

            <p>About this time began the Kingdom of the <hi>Mercians,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This Year also (according to the <hi>Welsh</hi> Annals) happened a great Slaughter of the <hi>Britains</hi> of the North; for now <hi>Gurgi</hi> and <hi>Fredur,</hi> two <hi>British</hi> Princes, being Brothers and Twins, the Sons of <hi>Oliver Gosgard Vawr, (i. e.

                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DXCI.</note>This year there was a great and bloody Battel fought at <hi>Wodensbeorge</hi> (now called <hi>Wodensburg,</hi> a little Village in <hi>Wiltshire)</hi> between the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> and the <hi>Saxons,</hi> though it is not here said who were the Generals on either side; only <hi>H.

            </p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Geoffry</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> makes <hi>Careticus</hi> above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to have succeeded <hi>Malgo</hi> (who perhaps was the same with <hi>Mael Gwineth)</hi> in the Kingdom of the <hi>Britains,</hi> whom he describes to have been a lover of Civil Wars, and to be hateful to God and all the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>; so that the <hi>Saxons</hi> seeing his weakness, invited <hi>Gormund</hi> an <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> King out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to Invade <hi>England</hi> with Six thousand <hi>Africans,</hi> who joining with the <hi>Saxons</hi> invaded the Territories of <hi>Careticus,</hi> and beating him in many Battels, at last besieged him in the City of <hi>Ciren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> which being taken and burnt, he again joined Battel with <hi>Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi> and forced him to fly beyond <hi>Severne</hi> into <hi>Wales</hi>; and then <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> destroying all the Neighbouring Cities, never left till he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the whole Island from Sea to Sea; and so for a time obtained the Supreme Dominion of the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But of these Kings <hi>Gareticus</hi> and <hi>Garmund,</hi> since not only the most Authentick <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicles, but the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals are wholly silent, I suppose them to have been only Romances, and invented by <hi>Geoffrey</hi> to fill up this Gap in his <hi>British</hi> History; not that I will deny that one <hi>Gormund</hi> a <hi>Danish</hi> King might reign in <hi>Ireland</hi> about this time; but that he ever reigned in <hi>England,</hi> is utterly false, no other Historian but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and those that borrow from him, making any mention of it.</p>

            <p>As for the <hi>British</hi> Affairs, we have but little more to remark ever since the Death of <hi>Maelgwin Gwineth,</hi> for the space of 24 years; only we find in the Book of <hi>Landaffe,</hi> that about this time <hi>Tudric</hi> King of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> who was still Victorious, is said to have exchanged his Crown for an Hermitage; till going in Aid of his Son <hi>Mouric,</hi> whom the <hi>Saxons</hi> had reduced to great extremity, taking up Arms again, he defended him against them at <hi>Tinterne,</hi> by the River <hi>Wye,</hi> but he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self received a Mortal Wound.</p>
            <p>But about the end of this Century (as <hi>Geoffry</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> relates) when the <hi>Britains</hi> could not agree for 24 years who should be their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, at last they chose <hi>Cadwan</hi> Prince of <hi>North Wales</hi> to be King of all the <hi>Britains</hi>; but the year of this Election is not set down by <hi>Geoffry,</hi> nor is this Prince mentioned by any other <hi>British</hi> Author or Chronicle, before he wrote. But I shall defer speaking farther of this Prince, till I come to the next Book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ceolwulf</hi> began to reign over the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi>

Preacher at <hi>Llan Patern</hi> in <hi>Cardiganshire,</hi> and the other in <hi>Cornwal</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Congal</hi> Abbot of <hi>Bangor,</hi> and <hi>Kentigern</hi> the famous Bishop of <hi>Ell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wye</hi> in <hi>North-Wales,</hi> as also <hi>Asaph</hi> his Scholar, and Successor in the same See, now from him called St. <hi>Asaph</hi>; to whom I may also add <hi>Taliessen,</hi> the famous <hi>British</hi> Poet, whose Verses are preserved to this day. All these flourished from the beginning till the middle of the Sixth Century, which now as much abounded in Learned and Pious Men, as the former Age was wanting of them.</p>
            <p>Thus, omitting Fables, we have given you a View of whatever we find can be relied on for Truth, transacted in <hi>Britain</hi> since the <hi>Romans</hi> first conquered and then forsook it: Wherein we may observe the many Miseries and Desolations brought by Divine Providence on a wicked and perverse Nation; driven (when nothing else would reform them) out of a Rich Countrey into a Mountainous and Barren Corner, by Strangers and Heathens: So much more intolerable in the Eye of Heaven is the dishonouring the Christian Faith and Religion by Unchristian Works, than downright Infidelity. Yet am I not of <hi>Bede</hi>'s Opinion, That the <hi>Britains</hi> omission to preach the Gospel to the <hi>English-Saxons</hi> (though they inhabited the same Island) was any of their crying Sins; since it was not to be expected, that they could either Preach, or the <hi>Saxons</hi> would ever Receive the Gospel from those who were their utter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and had taken their Countrey from them by Violence: Yet God was not wanting to this Nation, but appointed other Preachers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it to the Christian Faith; which how it was brought about, shall be the Subject of the ensuing Book.</p>

            <p>THIS Fourth Period will give us a new and more pleasant Prospect of the Affairs of <hi>Britain:</hi> For as the Gospel of Christ did now dispel that <hi>Egyptian</hi> Darkness of <hi>Paganism,</hi> under which it had so long laboured; so, together with <hi>Christianity,</hi> Human Learning (and consequently the Art of composing Histories or Annals) entred also with it; the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, which were not long after founded, being then the only Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities in which the Liberal Arts and Sciences were in those times chiefly taught and professed; which though it was not without a great mixture of that <hi>Gothic</hi> Barbarism that had then overspread all <hi>Europe,</hi> and even <hi>Italy</hi> it self, yet was it sufficient (in some measure) to instruct men not only in Divine, but Civil Knowledge; the Monks of that Age possessing the greatest share of Learning, and being almost the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Historians as well as Divines: Therefore we must be beholding to them for what Accounts we have, not only of the Ecclesiastical but Civil Affairs of those Times; for <hi>Bede,</hi> our first <hi>English</hi> Historian, was himself a Monk: And the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals (which we here give you) were first collected and written in divers Monasteries of <hi>England</hi>; and to which
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93814:151"/>
is to be ascribed that difference which is found between the Copies of that Chronicle, as to the Dates of Years, and other Matters; for before there was scarce any thing remembred by Tradition, but the great Wars and Battels fought by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings against the <hi>Britains</hi>; so, after the Monks came to commit things to writing, they began to make us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand somewhat of their Civil Constitutions, and the Acts of Peace as well as War; tho it must be confessed they are not so exact in the former as they might and ought to have been; minding more the relating of Visions and Miracles, which they supposed to have happen'd and been done in those times, for the Confirmation of some new Doctrines then not fully received: Yet however, I doubt not but from those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains they have left us, both the Constitution of their Governm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To which it was answered, They were Heathens; when, fetching a deep sigh, he said, <hi>It was pity the Father of Darkness should be Master of such bright Faces:</hi> They also told him, that they were called <hi>Angles,</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Deira,</hi> and that their Kings were named <hi>Aella:</hi> On each of which Names <hi>Bede</hi> either invents, or else had heard, that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> made divers <hi>Latin</hi> Allusions; which since, if translated, they would seem dry or trivial to most Readers, I therefore pass by.

               <hi>Gregory</hi> going immediately to the then Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> (for himself was not so as yet,) intreated him to order some Preachers of God's Word to be sent to the <hi>English</hi> Nation, by whose means it might be converted to Christ; and that he himself was ready to undertake the Performance of this Work, in case it would please the Pope to send him; who, although he was willing to grant his Request, yet the Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> (who had a great value for him,) would by no means permit that he should go so far from that City.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Agustine</hi> and his Companions, being thus confirmed by the Pope's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, proceeded in their Voyage, and passing thorough <hi>France</hi> took Sea, and landed in the Isle of <hi>Thanet,</hi> (lying on the East part of <hi>Kent</hi>) with about Forty Persons in his Company, together with some Interpreters of the <hi>French</hi> Nation: <hi>Ethelbert</hi> was at that time King of that Country; being the most powerful Prince that had Reigned there, as having extended the bounds of his Dominion, as far as the banks of the River <hi>Humber:</hi> As soon as <hi>Augustine</hi> arrived, he sent to King <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> giving him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that he came from <hi>Rome,</hi> and had brought good tidings of Eternal Happiness to all them that would receive it; the King hearing this, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that they should remain in the place where they landed, and that all necessaries should be plentifully supplied them, till he had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined what to do; for he had heard of the Christian Religion long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as having married a Christian Lady, called <hi>Bertha,</hi> Sister to the King of <hi>France,</hi> (as hath been already said) upon this condition, that she should have the free Exercise of her Religion, and liberty to have a Bishop of her own, named <hi>Lethard,</hi> whom she brought with her to assist and strengthen her in the Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:93814:152"/>The King after some Days came to the Island, and fearing Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, sate down in the open Air, commanding that <hi>Augustine</hi> and his Companions should be brought into his presence; for he was perswaded by his Country Superstition, that if they brought with them any Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they could not there so easily work upon him; but <hi>Augustine</hi> and his Companions Armed with the Power of God, and bearing a Silver Cross before them, with the Image of our Lord and Saviour painted on a Banner, came on singing (as in a solemn Procession) the Litany as they went, and praying unto God for the Eternal Salvation of those to whom they were sent: But when sitting down with the King, they had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Word of Life to him and his Nobles, the King thus spoke; <q>The Doctrines and the promises ye have made, are indeed fair and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting; But I am not as yet resolved to embrace them, since I cannot suddenly consent to quit that Religion I have so long professed, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the whole <hi>English</hi> Nation; yet because ye are Strangers, and come a long Journey, and as it seems would impart to us the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that Religion you believe to be the best, we will not give you the least Molestation, but rather will protect you, and take care that all things necessary shall be provided for your Maintenance; neither shall we prohibit you from gaining as many as you can, to the belief of your Religion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And accordingly he allotted them their residence in the City of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> (which was the Metropolis of his Kingdom) neither did he hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from the freedom of Preaching publickly to whom they would.</p>
            <p>When they came to the place provided for them, they began to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Innocent Life of the Primitive Christians, by applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to continual Prayers and Fasting, and especially to the Preaching the Word of God, to all that would hear them; despising the things of this World as superfluous; being content with the bare necessaries of Life; living exactly according to the Rules they taught others: the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of which, was, That many believed, and were baptized, admiring the simplicity of their Lives, as well as the Purity of their Doctrine.</p>
            <p>There was near this City, towards the <hi>East,</hi> an old ruinous Church anciently Built in honour of St. <hi>Martyn</hi>; whilest the <hi>Romans</hi> inhabited <hi>Britain,</hi> in which the Queen was wont to perform her Devotions: Here they first began to assemble and exercise their Spiritual Functions, until the King being converted, they obtained a full liberty of Preaching, and building Churches. But when the King, by the pure Lives of these Holy Men, as also by the Miracles they wrought, (as our Author relates) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came convinced of the Truth of their Doctrine, and was thereupon Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, many flocking in, from all Parts to hear the Gospel, and leaving their Heathanism, joyned themselves to the Church of Christ, (so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful a Motive is the Example of a Prince to his Subjects.) At whose Faith and Conversion, the King extreamly rejoyced; yet nevertheless would not compel any to receive Christianity; only those that believed, he cherished with a more tender regard; for he had learnt from the Authors of his Salvation, <hi>That the Service of Christ ought to be voluntary, and not constrained</hi>; neither did he defer long the giving his Teachers places fitting for their imployment, in his City of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; and confer'd upon them large Possessions: But this was not done till some time after, being
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93814:152"/>
confirmed in a great Council of his Kingdom, as shall be shewn in its proper place.</p>
            <p>But as soon as <hi>Augustine</hi> had by his Preaching converted the greatest part of the <hi>Kentish</hi> Nation, he returned into <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> CCCCXCVIII.</note> where he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Arch-Bishop of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, by <hi>Eutherius,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Arles,</hi> according to the commands they had received from Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> but upon his coming back into <hi>Britain,</hi> he sent immediately to <hi>Rome, Laurence</hi> a Priest, and <hi>Peter</hi> a Monk, to certifie the Pope, that the Christian Faith was now received by the <hi>English,</hi> and that he was now made Bishop; desiring also his Opinion in certain Questions, he thought necessary to be resolved. To all which, he speedily received such Answers from the Pope, as were proper to the Question proposed; some of which we have thought fit to insert into our History, because they shew us, what was the State of Religion in the <hi>Western</hi> Church, when <hi>Augustine</hi> came over hither.</p>
            <p>His first Question was, how the Bishops should converse with their Clergy, as also concerning those things that are Offered at the Altar, by the Oblations of the Faithful? And how many Portions there ought to be made of them? And how a Bishop ought to behave himself in the Church? To these things the Pope answered to this effect.</p>
            <p>That as for Bishops, how they ought to carry themselves in the Church, the Holy Scriptures teach, and especially the Epistles of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi>; in which he endeavours to teach him, how he ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himself in the House of God: also that out of every thing that shall be Offered at the Altar, there ought to be made four divisions, <hi>viz.</hi> One for the Bishop and his Family, for Hospitality, and Entertainment of Strangers; the Second for the Clergy; the Third for the Poor; and the Fourth for Repairing of Churches: But as you are well skilled in the Monastic Rules, nothing ought to be possessed by any Clergy-men in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in the <hi>English</hi> Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rch, which lately by God's Grace is brought to the Faith; but you ought to imitate the Primitive Converts, among whom none enjoyed any thing as his own, of those things he possessed, but all things were in common among them.</p>
            <p>In the second Question, <hi>Agustine</hi> desires to be inform'd, whether Priests, not able to contain, may Marry? And if they shall Marry, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they must return to the Secular Life?</p>
            <p>This Question <hi>Bede</hi> hath not, but preposterously joins the following Answer to the first Question: Yet Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> hath added it, out of the <hi>Paris</hi> Edition of Councils, <hi>Anno</hi> 1518.</p>
            <p>Where the Answer of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> is thus, That if there be any of the Clergy out of Holy Orders that cannot contain, they ought to Marry, and still to receive their Stipends, concluding great care ought to be had of the Stipends of the Clergy, that they may be diligent in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and that there was no occasion of making a long discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their keeping Hospitality, when all the over-plus ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon Pious and Religious uses?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:93814:153"/>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> CCCCXCVIII.</note>The third Question of <hi>Augustine</hi> was this, that since there is but one Faith; Why are there divers customs of Churches? One manner of saying Mass in the Holy <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and another in those of <hi>Gaul</hi>?</p>
            <p>To which Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> answered to this effect: You know very well the custom of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in which you were bred, but it is my pleasure, That if you can find either in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or those of <hi>Gaul,</hi> or in any other Churches, any thing more pleasing to God, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully choose it, and what things soever you can gather from any other Churches, of Good and Pious Example, bring them into the <hi>English</hi> Church; for things are not to be belov'd for the places, but places for the good things that are in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustine</hi>'s fourth Question was, What Punishment ought to be inflicted on him that commits Sacriledge?</p>
            <p>The Pope's Answer to this Question being somewhat long, I shall only give you the substance of it. In the first place, He distinguishes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those who commit Theft out of a wicked intent, and those that offend out of necessity; from whence it follows, that some are to be punished with Fines, others with Stripes, and some more severely; and when (says he) you proceed against any with more rigour than ordinary, you must do it out of Charity, not out of Anger; because the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is inflicted to this intent, that the party punished may be saved: Then shews the end of such punishments from the Example of Fathers correcting their Children, purely for their good, though they love them very well; he admonishes him to use a mean in chastising them, and not without the Rules of Reason: But if you ask how things taken from the Church are to be restored? God forbid that the Church should receive any encrease for the loss of meer Earthly things, or go about to make advantage of such trifles.</p>
            <p>The three following Questions, concerning in what degrees of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ity Men and Women may Marry, I shall omit, as being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to our purpose; and shall proceed to the Eighth Question which is this.</p>
            <p>If, for the great distance of places, Bishops cannot easily meet, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Bishop may be ordain'd, without the presence of other Bishops?</p>
            <p>The Answer of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> is to this effect; Certain it is, That in the <hi>English</hi> Church, wherein as yet there is no other Bishop but your self, you can ordain a Bishop no other way than without Bishops: for how can Bishops come from <hi>Gaul,</hi> that may assist at the Ordination of a Bishop in <hi>Britain</hi>? But we would have you so to appoint Bishops, that they be not too far asunder from one another, that there may be no hinderance; but that at the Ordination of a Bishop others may be present, and such other Presbyters also, whose presence is requisite, ought to have easie means of access; when therefore Bishops shall be so ordained in places near one another, the Ordination of a Bishop ought never to be without Three or Four Bishops assisting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> CCCCXCVIII.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Pope's Answer was to this purpose, for being somewhat long, we shall also contract it.</p>
            <p>In the first place, The Pope allows him no Authority over the Bishops of <hi>Gaul,</hi> any further than by Advice, or Spiritual Admonition, if they should happen to be guilty of any faults, because they were no ways subject to his Authority: and concludes thus; But all the Bishops of <hi>Britain</hi> we commit to your Brotherhood: That the Ignorant may be Taught, the Weak by perswasions strengthned, and the perverse corrected by our Authority; The remaining Questions, concerning Women with Child, and other unnecessary, if not immodest things, I omit.</p>

               <hi>Augustine</hi> having about this time sent the Pope word, that the Harvest indeed was great, but the Labourers few,<note place="margin">

            <p>They place Pope <hi>Gregory's</hi> sending to the Pall to Arch Bishop <hi>Augustine,</hi> with many holy Teachers to assist him: Sometime after the sending these Messengers with these Letters, the Pope also writ other Letters to <hi>Mellitus,</hi> 
               <q>Wherein he gives him Instructions concerning the Temples of Idols, which the Pope would not have pull'd down, but only new Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by the sprinkling of Holy Water, and erecting of new Altars; and as for the Oxen that used to be sacrificed to their false Gods, he would have such kind of Solemnities so to be observed, That on the days of the Dedication of their Churches, or of the Holy Martyrs, whose Relicts were there preserved, Booths should be made up of boughs near the said Churches, where having kill'd those Oxen (that were formerly wont to be sacrificed) they might make merry, in giving God thanks; since it was certain, that it should be impossible to take away all vain and Superstitious customs at once, out of Men's minds so prejudiced by long Education.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>At the same time also the Pope returned an Answer to other Letters which <hi>Augustine</hi> had before wrote to him; wherein, having congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated his great success in the Conversion of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, and also taking notice of the great Miracles that Almighty God had done by him; he tells him, That though he may rejoyce in some measure for that Heavenly gift, yet with such a joy, as ought to be allay'd with fear; for as he might rejoyce, that the Souls of the <hi>English</hi> were through Miracles drawn to an inward Grace, so he ought to be afraid, least by the Miracles that were now wrought, his Mind might be puffed up by vain Glory; Therefore that he ought still to remember, that when the Disciples, returning from their preaching with joy, said to their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Master, <hi>Lord, in thy name the Devils be subject unto us,</hi> they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently received a rebuke; rejoyce not for this, but <hi>rather rejoyce, that your Names are written in Heaven.</hi>

               </note> for he had then the supreme command over all the Nations of the <hi>English Saxons,</hi> as far as the Banks of <hi>Humber</hi>; but when this Province had by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Mellitus</hi> received the Gospel of Christ, K. <hi>Sebert</hi> (also baptized <hi>Ethelbert</hi>) caused the Church of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be built at <hi>London,</hi> where <hi>Mellitus</hi> and his Successours, should fix their Episcopal See.</p>
            <p>But as for the other Bishop <hi>Justus, Augustine</hi> ordained him Bishop in the Kingdom of <hi>Kent,</hi> of a certain little City, then called <hi>Rofcaester</hi> (now

            <p>Hitherto <hi>Augustine</hi> had laboured only to convert Infidels; but now he took upon him,<note place="margin">Bede <hi>Ib. c.</hi> 2.</note> by vertue of his Archiepiscopal, or rather Legatine Authority, which the Pope had conferr'd upon him, over all the Bishops of <hi>Britain,</hi> (properly so called) to make a general Visitation of his Province, and coming as far as the borders of <hi>Wales,</hi> (being assisted by the power of King <hi>Ethelbert,</hi>) he summoned all the <hi>British</hi> Bishops of the adjoyning Provinces, to a Synod, at a place called in <hi>Bede</hi>'s time, <hi>Augustines Ake,</hi> (or Oak) then Scituate on the confines of the <hi>Wecti,</hi> now the Diocess of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and the <hi>West; Saxons</hi> (supposed to be somewhere on the edge of <hi>Worcester-shire,</hi>) and began to perswade them by brotherly Admonitions, that they would maintain the Catholick Unity, and also joyn in the work of Preaching the Gospel to the Infidel Nations.</p>
            <p>For there was then a great difference between them about the Rule of keeping <hi>Easter,</hi> which <hi>Bede</hi> tells us, The <hi>Britains</hi> did not keep at a right time; but observed it from the <hi>Fourteenth</hi> to the <hi>Twentieth</hi> Day of the Moon, which Computation is continued in a <hi>Cycle</hi> of Eighty Four Years; which account being somewhat obscure, I shall, for the clearing of it, set down what the learned Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> hath given us upon this subject, in his <hi>Historical Account of Church Government</hi> (already cited in the last Book) where he takes notice,<note place="margin">

Then the <hi>Britains</hi> confessed indeed, That they believed that the Doctrine which <hi>Augustine</hi> preached was the Truth; but that they could not, without the general Consent of their own Nation, quit the ancient Rites and Customs of their Country; wherefore they desired, that more of their Clergy being assembled, there should be a General Synod held about it; which when it was agreed to, there came (as they relate) se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>British</hi> Bishops, (their Annals relate them to have been Seven in all,) together with several Learned Men, especially from the Monastery of <hi>Bangor,</hi> over which one <hi>Dinoth</hi> is said to have been then Abbot, and in which there was so many Monks, all living by their own Labour, that being divided into seven Divisions under as many Rectors, each of these Divisions had not less than 300 Men.</p>
            <p>But their Abbot <hi>Dinoth,</hi> and his Clergy, a little before their going to the aforesaid Synod, went first to a certain Man both Holy and Wise, who led an Anchorite's Life among them, whom they asked, <q>Whether they should lay aside their ancient Traditions at the Preaching of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> or no?</q> Who made this Answer, <hi>If he is a Man of God, follow him.</hi> They said, 'How shall we know this? He replied, <hi>The Lord says,</hi> 
               <q>Take my Yoak upon you, for I am meek and humble in Heart:</q> 
               <hi>Perhaps that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self beareth the Yoak of Christ, and offereth the same to be born of you; but if he be cruel and proud, it is apparent that he is not of God, neither need you to regard what he saith.</hi> They said again, <q>But how shall we make a Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of that?</q> He replied, <hi>Contrive it so, that he and his Company may come first into the place of the Synod, and if he shall rise up to you when you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, know then that he is the Servant of Christ, and obediently hear him; but if he shall despise you, nor will rise up to you, when you are more in number, let him be slighted by you also.</hi> They did as he directed them; and it fell out that <hi>Augustine</hi> bearing himself as the Pope's Legate, and their <hi>Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> as they drew near sate still in his Chair; which when they saw, they grew presently angry, accusing him of Pride, and endeavouring in all Things he said to contradict him. But</p>
            <p>He began thus to discourse to them: <hi>Whereas ye do many Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our received Customs, and the Consent of the Catholick Church; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, if ye will obey me in these few Things, to wit, That ye celebrate</hi> Easter <hi>in its proper Time; That ye perform the Ministery of Baptism according to the Custom of the Holy</hi> Roman <hi>Apostolick Church; That ye preach the Word of GOD together with us to the</hi> English <hi>Nation: Then, as for all other Things which ye practise, although contrary to our Customs, we will quickly tolerate them.</hi> But they made answer, <q>That they would do none of those Things, neither would they acknowledge him for their Arch-Bishop.</q> And discoursing further among themselves, they said, <q>If he would not just now rise up unto us, how much more, when we shall be subject to him, will he then look upon us as nothing?</q> To whom <hi>Augustine</hi> is reported thus threatningly to have denounced against them: <hi>If ye will not now accept of Peace with your Brethren, ye are like to find War from your

And this Obedience we are ready to give, and to pay to him, and to every Christian conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually: Besides, we are under the Government of the Bishop of</hi> Caerleon <hi>upon</hi> Uske, <hi>who is to oversee under GOD over us, to cause us to keep the way Spiritual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence we may observe, that the Christian Religion came not first into <hi>Britain</hi> by the Preaching of any Persons sent from <hi>Rome,</hi> for then they would still have owned Canonical Obedience to the Pope, as well as the <hi>English</hi> did afterwards; therefore it is most likely, according to the Traditions given you in the Second Book, that it was first preached and propagated here by some Apostle or Disciple of the <hi>Eastern</hi> or <hi>Asia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Church: And thô a late <hi>Romish</hi> Writer very much arraigns the Credit of this Manuscript, as made since the Days of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and cavils at the <hi>Welsh</hi> thereof, as Modern, and full of false Spelling, yet is not this any material Exception against it; since the <hi>Welsh</hi> used in it is not so Modern as he would make it, as I am credibly informed by those who are Criticks in that Language; and as for the Spelling, that may be the fault of the Transcribers: And thô the Archiepiscopal See was then removed from <hi>Caer-Leon</hi> to St. <hi>David</hi>'s, yet it might still retain the former Title, as of the first and most famous Place.</p>

            <p>Under this Year <hi>Bede</hi> also places the Death of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, of whose Life and Actions he gives us a long Account, to which I refer you; but the <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicle puts off the Death of this Pope to the next Year; but I rather follow <hi>Bede</hi> as the ancienter and more authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Author.</p>
            <p>The same Year is also very remarkable for Civil, as well as Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Affairs in this Island; for now King <hi>Ethelbert</hi> summoned a <hi>Mycel Synod,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vi</hi> Spelman<hi>'s Council,</hi> 1 <hi>Vol. p.</hi> 118, 119, 120.</note> or Great Council, as well of the Clergy as Laity, wherein by their common Consent and Approbation all the Grants and Charters of this King, whereby he had settled great Endowments on <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> and that of St. <hi>Pancrace</hi> in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> were confirmed, which had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the old ruinous Church of St. <hi>Martin</hi> without the City already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; but the Charters now made and confirmed by King <hi>Ethelbert</hi> in this Council are almost word for word the same with those he had made by himself before, with heavy Imprecations against any, who should dare to infringe them, as you may see in Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi>'s First-Volume of <hi>British Councils</hi>; where this Learned Author in his Notes farther shews us, that these Charters above-mentioned are very suspicious of being forged in many respects; as First, That this King there stiles himself King of the <hi>English</hi> in general, whereas indeed he was no more than King of <hi>Kent:</hi> Secondly, Because the Year of our Lord is expressed at their Conclusion, which was not in use till long after: Besides, an old Manuscript of the Church of <hi>Canterbury</hi> says expresly, That the Monks of the Monastery had their Lands and Priviledges by a long and peaceable Possession accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Custom, until King <hi>Wightred, Anno Dom.</hi> 693; made them a confirmation of all their Priviledges by a Charter under his Soul. There are also other Exceptions against the Bull that is there recited to be Arch-Bishop <hi>Augustine</hi>'s, which you may see at large in those Learned Notes above-mentioned.</p>
            <p>In this great Council or Synod, among many other Secular Laws and Decrees, these deserve particularly to be taken notice of; the first Law assigns the Penalty of Sacriledge, appointing what Amends is to be made for Things taken from a Bishop, by a Restitution of nine times the value; from a Priest by a Ninth, and from a Deacon by a Threefold Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The Second Law is, That if the King summon'd his People, and any Man should presume then to do them Injury, he shall make double Amends to the Party, and besides shall pay Fifty Shillings to the King.</p>
            <p>The Third Law is, That if the King shall drink in a Man's House, and there be any Injury done in his Presence, the Party so doing it shall make double Satisfaction; the rest that follow, since they belong only to the Correction of Manners, are omitted.</p>
            <p>To these Laws <hi>Bede</hi> relates, when he says, That King <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> amongst other good Things which he conferr'd upon his Nation, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed certain Laws concerning Judgments, by the Councel of his wise Men, according to the Example of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, were yet kept and observed by them to this time; and then mentions some of those Laws to the same effect as they are already expressed.</p>

               <hi>H. Huntington</hi> gives a more particular account of this Action, and says; That King <hi>Ethelfrid,</hi> having gathered together a powerful Army, made a great Slaughter of the <hi>Britains</hi> near the City of <hi>Legions,</hi> which is called by the English <hi>Lege Cestre,</hi> but more rightly by the Britains <hi>Caer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legion</hi>; so that it is evident it cannot be <hi>Leicester,</hi> as our common Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians write, but <hi>West-Chester,</hi> which lay near the Borders of King <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frid</hi>'s Kingdom, where this Battle was fought: This Author further adds, That when the King saw those Priests or Monks of the Abby of <hi>Bangor,</hi> who came out to pray for the Army, ranged by themselves in a place of Safety, having one <hi>Brockmaile</hi> for their Defender, and that the King knew for what end they came thither; he presently said, <hi>If these Men pray to their GOD against us, though they do not make use of Arms, yet do they as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> that this Fight was at <hi>Chester,</hi> (then in the hands of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>;) which when King <hi>Ethelfrid</hi> went about to besiege, the Townsmen resolving to suffer any thing rather than a Siege, trusting in their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, sallied out to fight, whom when by an Ambush laid near the City, he had easily overcome; he then falling upon the Monks, who were come in great Numbers to pray for the Success of the <hi>British</hi> Army, of which (says this Author) there must certainly have been an incredible Number, since even in his time there were left such vast Remains of Churches and Cloysters, and so great a heap of Ruines, as you can scarce (says he) find any where else: The Place is called <hi>Bangor,</hi> which was then an Abby of Monks, but is now turned into a Bishoprick; yet here our Author was mistaken, for this <hi>Bangor,</hi> where the Monastery was, is in <hi>Flintshire,</hi> not far from the River <hi>Dee</hi>; whereas that which is the Seat of the Bishoprick is in <hi>Caernarvanshire,</hi> not far from the River or Streight of <hi>Menai,</hi> which parts that Country from the Isle of <hi>Anglesey.</hi> But of all these great Ruines mentioned by <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> there is now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left, save those of the two principal Gates of this old City, the one of which is on that side towards <hi>England,</hi> and the other towards <hi>Wales,</hi> being about a Mile asunder, the River <hi>Dee</hi> running betwixt them.</p>

In the first place therefore, I shall not deny, that <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> in his First Book <hi>De Gest. Pontif. Anglor.</hi> as well as divers other Historians of later Times, suppose <hi>Augustine</hi> to have sate Arch-Bishop 15 (and in some Copies 16) Years, and then he must certainly have survived this Massacre of the Monks of <hi>Bangor</hi>; but if I can prove they were mistaken in this Account, all that had been said to prove <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> guilty of it, will signifie nothing: For First, <hi>Bede</hi> relates,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> that <hi>Augustine,</hi> being yet alive, ordained <hi>Laurence</hi> for his Successor, lest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self being dead, the yet weak State of that Church, if vacant, (thô for never so small a time) might happen to suffer, which it must be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed he did, when he found himself in a declining condition, and not like long to survive. Now that this happened in the Year 605, may be also proved by these Circumstances: <hi>Bede</hi> hath already told us, that <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> in the Year 604, had ordained <hi>Mellitus</hi> and <hi>Justus</hi> Bishops; imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after which Relation, follows that, concerning <hi>Augustine</hi>'s Death, which he would scarce have mentioned there, had not one followed the other within a short time; and that it was so, appears in the Manuscript Text of <hi>Adrian,</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who lived within less than 60 Years after, and who obtained a Priviledge from Pope <hi>Deusdedit,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Free Election of the Abbot of that Monastery, at the end of which there is this Passage: <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 605. died the holy Bishop <hi>Gregory IV<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Idus Martii,</hi> and in the same Year also Bishop <hi>Augustine VII<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Kal.

            <p>This Year <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent</hi> dyed, who was the first <hi>English</hi> King that rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ived Baptism; <hi>Bede</hi> tells us, That this King dyed above Twenty Years after his Conversion, and was buried in St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s Porch, in the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi>; after whose decease <hi>Eadbald</hi> his Son succeeded to him in the Kingdom. The beginning of whose Reign I shall give you out of <hi>Bede,</hi> being much more particular than that in the Chronicle.</p>
            <p>This King did not only refuse the Faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> but also polluted himself with such Fornication, which the Apostle says, ought not to be heard of among the Gentiles, in that he Married his Father's Wife; by which wickedness he gave occasion to those to return to their former Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenism, who had embraced Christianity in his Father's Reign, either out of Fear, or hopes of Favour; thô God's Judgments were not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Correct this Infidel King, for he was tormented with frequent fits of Frensie, and the possession of an unclean Spirit; but the Death of <hi>Sebert</hi> King of the <hi>East Saxons,</hi> happening also about this time, extremely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased the present Storm of Afflictions; for he left Three Sons Heirs to his Kingdom, who all relapsed to <hi>Paganism,</hi> having in their Father's life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time seemed <hi>Christians,</hi> but now permitted all their Subjects the free licence of worshiping Idols; and when they saw the Bishop Administring the Eucharist to the People in the Church, they thus spoke to him in their Barbarous folly; <q>Why dost thou not give us this White Bread, which thou wert wont to Minister to our Father? To whom the Bishop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, That they must first be washed in that saving <hi>Font,</hi> in which their Father had been Baptised, and then they might partake of the same Bread; which though they deny'd to do, yet would they not desist from requiring this Bread at his hands; which he still refusing them,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93814:159"/>
they then plainly told him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCXVI.</note> That if he would not yield to them in so small a matter, he must not stay any longer in their Dominions; and so commanded them to be gone; who being thus expelled, went thence into <hi>Kent</hi> to consult with the Bishops <hi>Laurentius</hi> and <hi>Justus,</hi> what was best to be done on this occasion; where it was decreed by <hi>common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> That it was better that all of them should return into their own Countrey, there to serve God with freedom of Conscience, than to live without any Fruit of their Labours amongst such Barbarous Rebels to the Christian Faith; thereupon <hi>Mellitus</hi> and <hi>Justus</hi> departed first, and went into <hi>France,</hi> there resolving to expect the issue of these things; but not long after, these Three Princes, who had driven out a Preacher of the Truth, and relapsed to the Worship of Idols, marching out to Battel against the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> were all cut off, together with their Army:</q> However, though the Authors of this Apostacy were destroyed, yet the common people being once inured to wickedness, could not easily be brought back to the Faith of Christ.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>Laurentius</hi> was about to leave <hi>Britain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bede, <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> to follow <hi>Mellitus</hi> and <hi>Justus,</hi> he ordered a Pallet to be laid for him in the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> on which (after many Prayers and Tears poured forth to God, he laid down to take his rest; where, (if credit may be given to <hi>Bede's</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation) St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in whose Church he had spent great part of the Night in watching and Prayer, appeared to him, and to make the Vision more sensible, gave him many stripes for thus offering to desert his Flock; at sight whereof the King (to whom next morning he shewed the marks of what he had suffered, and by whom, and for what cause) relenting, in great fear renounced his Incestuous Marriage, and applied himself to the Christian Faith more sincerely than before, together with all his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but the <hi>Londoners</hi> refusing again to receive their Bishop <hi>Mellitus,</hi> this King had not so much power as his Father to force them to it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would or not; yet nevertheless, he with all his Nation, from the time that he was thus re-converted to Christ, endeavoured wholly to submit himself to the Divine Precepts, and then near the Monastery of the Apostles built a Church, in honour of the blessed Virgin, which was consecrated by Archbishop <hi>Mellitus:</hi> But to return again to Civil Affairs.</p>
            <p>This Year also <hi>Edwin,</hi> of the Blood-Royal of <hi>Northumberland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Id. Ibid.</hi>
               </note> having been forced to fly from <hi>Ethelfrid,</hi> then King of that Countrey, had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd for some Years as a banished Man, through divers Kingdoms, till at last he took refuge with <hi>Redwald,</hi> King of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> beseeching him to save his Life from so cruel and unjust a Persecution; who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon receiving him into his protection, granted his Request; but whilst he thus sojourned with King <hi>Redwald,</hi> he had a Vision or Apparition, which was the cause of his future Conversion, and which though it looks very much like a Monkish Legend, yet since it is related by so grave an Author as <hi>Bede,</hi> I shall here from him set down.</p>
            <p>So soon as <hi>Ethelfrid</hi> heard where <hi>Edwin</hi> was, he sent Ambassadors to <hi>Redwald,</hi> offering him a great Sum of Money to put him to death; which being refused, he still repeated, and increased his offers, twice or thrice threatning War, if he were refused; till at last the King being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prevailed upon by his great proffers, or terrified by his threatnings, yielded, promising either to kill <hi>Edwin,</hi> or to deliver him to his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors; which when a certain Friend of <hi>Edwin</hi>'s, then near the King,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:93814:160"/>
came to know,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCXVI.</note> the first hour of the Night he went in haste to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and calling him forth for better secresy, revealed to him his Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and offer'd him his Aid to make his Escape, where neither <hi>Redwald</hi> nor <hi>Ethelfrid</hi> should ever find him: But he not approving of that course, as seeming dishonourable, without more manifest cause to begin first to distrust one who so long had been his only Refuge, chose rather to dye by his Hand, than by any other more Ignoble: Whereupon his Friend de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, <hi>Edwin</hi> being thus left alone without the Palace-Gate, full of sad and perplexed Thoughts, discerns about the dead of Night a man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching towards him, neither by Countenance nor Habit to him known, who after a short Salutation asked him, <q>Why at this Hour, when all others were at Rest, he alone sate so sadly waking on a cold stone?</q> 
               <hi>Edwin</hi> wondering not a little who he might be, asked him again, <hi>What his sitting within doors or without, concerned him?</hi> To whom he again replied, <q>Think not that who thou art, or why sitting here, or what danger hangs over thee, is to me unknown. But what would you promise to that man who would free you out of all these Troubles, and persuade <hi>Redwald</hi> not to molest you, nor give you up to your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?</q> 
               <hi>All that I am able,</hi> answered <hi>Edwin</hi> to the Unknown: Then he proceeds thus; <q>What if the same Person should promise to make you greater than any <hi>English</hi> King hath been before you?</q> 
               <hi>I should not doubt,</hi> replied <hi>Edwin, to be answerably Grateful.</hi> 
               <q>But what if to all this he would inform you (saith the other) of a way to Happiness beyond what any of your Ancestors had known?</q> Would you hearken to his Counsel? <hi>Edwin,</hi> without any Hesitancy, promised he would. Then the other, laying his right Hand on his Head, said, <q>When this Sign shall next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall you, remember this Night, and this Discourse; nor defer to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what thou hast now promised.</q> And with these words disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, he was not only convinced that it was not a Man, but a Spirit that had thus talked with him: But the Royal Youth was also much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, when on the sudden his Friend, who had been gone all this while to listen farther what was like to be resolved concerning him, comes back, and joyfully bids him go to his Repose, for that the King's Mind, tho for a while drawn aside, was now fully resolved, not only never to betray him, but to defend him against all his Enemies, as he had promised: In short, the King was as good as his word, and not only refused to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him up, but also raising Forces, thereby helped him to regain his Kingdom: For the next Year, as the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals relate,</p>

                  <hi>Ethelfrid</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> was slain by <hi>Redwald</hi> King of the <hi>East Angles</hi>; and <hi>Eadwin</hi> the Son of <hi>Aella</hi> succeeded him (in that Kingdom), who subjected all <hi>Britain</hi> to him, (except only <hi>Kent):</hi> He also banished the Royal Youths, the Sons of <hi>Ethelfrid, (viz.)

            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> gives us a more particular Account of this Fight; and that since War had been denounced by <hi>Ethelfrid,</hi> upon his refusing to deliver <hi>Edwin,</hi> that thereupon <hi>Redwald</hi> determin'd to be before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with the Danger, and with an Army raised on the sudden, surprize <hi>Ethelfrid</hi> (being not aware of an Invasion), and in a Fight near to the East side of the River <hi>Idel,</hi> on the <hi>Mercian</hi> Border (now in <hi>Nottingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>) slew him, dispatching easily those few Forces which he had got to march out over-hastily with him; who yet (as a Testimony that his

By this Victory <hi>Redwald</hi> became so far Superiour to the other <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, that <hi>Bede</hi> reckons him as the next after <hi>Aella,</hi> and <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> who had all <hi>England</hi> on this side <hi>Humber</hi> under his Obedience.</p>
            <p>But to look back a little to Ecclesiastical Affairs; about this time <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius</hi> the Archbishop died, and was buried near <hi>Augustine</hi> his Predecessor; to whom succeeded <hi>Mellitus,</hi> who was Bishop of <hi>London</hi>; this <hi>Mellitus</hi> is related by <hi>Bede,</hi> to have by his Prayers stopp'd a great Fire in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> by causing the Wind to blow the quite contrary way to what it did before; which at last quite falling, the Fire ceased with it.

and worthy of GOD.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCXXV.</note> Upon these Terms the Lady was sent to <hi>Edwin,</hi> and <hi>Paulinus</hi> being ordained Bishop, (as was before resolved on,) was sent as a Spiritual Guardian to the Virgin; who, when he came to King <hi>Edwin</hi>'s Court, used his utmost Endeavour to convert the Pagans to the Christian Faith, but to little purpose for a long time, tho' at last he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed by this occasion.

            <p>When <hi>Cuichelme,</hi> (at that time one of the two <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Kings,) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious of the growing Greatness of King <hi>Edwin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCXXVI.</note> sent privily one <hi>Eomer,</hi> an hired Cut-Throat, to assassinate him; He, under pretence of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Message from his Master, with a poyson'd Weapon stabs at <hi>Edwin</hi> whil'st he was discoursing with him in his House, (by the River <hi>Derwent</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi>) on an Easter-day; which <hi>Lilla,</hi> one of the King's Attendants, at the lucky instant perceiving, having no other Means to defend him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed his own Body to receive the Blow, thrô which, notwithstanding, it reached the King's Person, with a dangerous Wound; the Murtherer being now encompassed with many Swords, and made more desperate by his own Danger, slew another of the King's Servants in the same manner.</p>
            <p>That Night the Queen brought forth a Daughter, who was called <hi>Eanfled</hi>; and when the King, in the presence of <hi>Paulinus,</hi> gave Thanks to his Gods for the Birth of his Daughter, the Bishop, on the contrary, gave Thanks to our Lord <hi>Christ,</hi> that the Queen was safely delivered by his Prayers: At which, the King, being well pleased, promised the Bishop to renounce his Idols, and become the Servant of <hi>Christ,</hi> if he would grant him Life, and Victory against that King who had thus sent a Murtherer to kill him; and as an earnest thereof, he gave his new-born Daughter to be bred up in that Religion; who, with 12 other of his Family, on the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> was baptised; and by that time, being well recovered of his Wound, to punish the Authors of so foul a Fact, he march'd with an Army against the <hi>West Saxons</hi>; whom having subdued, and put some of those to Death who had conspired against him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived others to Mercy, he return'd home victorious.</p>

            <p>But thô after this Victory K. <hi>Edwin</hi> forbore to worship Idols, yet ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured he not presently to receive Baptism, but first took care to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted aright by the Bishop <hi>Paulinus</hi> in the Principles of the Christian Faith; still conferring with himself, and others of his chief Men whom he thought most wise, what was best to be done in so weighty an Affair; and he himself, being a Man of a piercing Understanding, when he was alone often considered with himself which Religion was best to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>

                  <hi>Ibid. cap.</hi> 20.</note> 
               <hi>Bede</hi> also tells us, That <hi>Cadwallo</hi> this year rebelling against King <hi>Edwin,</hi> together with <hi>Penda,</hi> invaded the Kingdom of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> when King <hi>Edwin</hi> raising an Army met them at a place called <hi>Hethfield</hi> (now <hi>Hatfield</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire)</hi> and there fought a bloody Battel, wherein King <hi>Edwin</hi> himself was slain, and his whole Army quite routed; in which Fight <hi>Osfrid</hi> his Son, a Warlike Young Prince also fell; but <hi>Edfrid</hi> the Younger being compelled by necessity to surrender himself to <hi>Penda,</hi> was afterwards by him mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, contrary to his Oath. This happen'd in the 17<hi>th.</hi> year of King <hi>Edwin</hi>'s Reign, having till now been successful in all his Undertakings.</p>
            <p>But there now ensued a very sad Destruction of the <hi>English</hi> Nation of the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> since of these two Generals, the one was a professed <hi>Pagan,</hi> and the other, though a Christian in Name, yet shewed himself worse than a <hi>Pagan</hi>; for <hi>Cadwallo,</hi> altho he professed Christianity, yet was so barbarous, that he spared neither Age not Sex, but put all to death with great Cruelty; tyranizing for a long while over all those Provinces, and seeming resolved quite to extirpate the <hi>English</hi> Nation; nor did he shew any respect to Churches or other Sacred Places; it being then the custom of the <hi>Britains</hi> (in <hi>Bede</hi>'s time) to set at nought the Faith and Religion of the <hi>English-Saxons</hi>; neither would they have any thing to do with them, more than with <hi>Pagans:</hi> But the Head of the slain King was brought to <hi>York,</hi> and there deposited in the Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which he himself had begun, and <hi>Oswald</hi> his Successor finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. All things being thus in confusion in those parts, and no Refuge or Safety any where to be expected, Queen <hi>Aethelburga</hi> returned by Sea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Kent,</hi> together with <hi>Paulinus</hi> the Archbishop, and was there received with great Honour by King <hi>Eadbald</hi> and Archbishop <hi>Honorius</hi>; she was conducted thither by <hi>Basse,</hi> a Valiant Captain of King <hi>Edwin</hi>'s, who also brought with him <hi>Eanfrede</hi> the King's Daughter, as also <hi>Vscfrea</hi> his Son, and <hi>Iffi</hi> his Grandson by <hi>Osfrid</hi>; whom their Mother afterward, for fear of the Kings <hi>Eadbald</hi> and <hi>Oswald,</hi> sent into <hi>France</hi> to King <hi>Dago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> to be brought up, where they both died in their Infancy.</p>

The Bishop instantly replied, <hi>Sir, What do you say? Is that Son of a Mare more dear to you than the Son of GOD</hi>? With that they went to Dinner, the Bishop took his Seat, but the King, being newly come in from Hunting, fate down by the Fire with his Attendants; but remembring what the Bishop had said, he rose suddenly up, and giving his Sword to his Servant, ran hastily to the Bishop, and falling down at his Feet, besought him not to be angry, affirming, he would never after speak, or concern himself, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he gave to the Children of GOD. The Bishop being wonderfully amazed, and rising hastily from his Seat, raised him up, telling him, he was very well pleased if he would but sit down to Dinner, and be chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: The King then, at his Request, began to be merry; but the Bishop to be sad, in so much that he shed Tears; of which his Priest taking Notice, and in their own Language (being the Scottish, which neither <hi>Oswin</hi> nor his Servants understood,) demanded the Reason: <hi>I know</hi> (saith he,) <hi>that the King will not live long, for till now I never beheld an humble King; whence I apprehend, that he will speedily be taken away from us; for this Nation is not worthy of such a Governor.</hi> Not long after, this Prelage of the Bishop was fulfilled in the Murther of <hi>Oswin</hi> (as you have heard); But <hi>Aidan</hi> lived 'till the twelfth day after his Death, and then died himself on the last of <hi>August:</hi> Of the Miracles of which Bishop, <hi>Bede</hi> gives u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCLIII.</note> would receive Baptism; but he having heard the Preaching of the Gospel, through the Hope of a future Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, voluntarily professed that he would be a Christian, whether he had married the Virgin or not; being chiefly persuaded to receive the Faith by <hi>Alcfrid,</hi> the Son of King <hi>Oswy,</hi> who was his Friend and Relation, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving married <hi>Cymburge</hi> his Sister: So that King was baptised by Bishop <hi>Finan,</hi> together with all his Train, in that famous Town of the King's, which <hi>Bede</hi> calls <hi>Admurum</hi> (that is, <hi>Walltown,</hi> near the <hi>Picts</hi> Wall); and taking with him four Priests to teach and baptise his Nation, he return'd home with much Joy; these Priests coming with the King into this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince preach'd GOD's Word, and were as willingly heard and receiv'd; and both, the Noble as well as the inferior sort, renouncing their Idolatry, were baptised; nor did King <hi>Penda</hi> himself prohibit them from preaching in his own Kingdom, if they would, if they would, but rather hated and despised those, whom, professing the Faith of Christ, he found not to perform Works suitable to it; calling them miserable and contemptible Wretches, who failed to obey that GOD in whom they believed. These Things fell out two Years before the Death of King <hi>Penda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the same time the <hi>East-Saxons,</hi> at the Instance of King <hi>Oswy,</hi> again received the Christian Faith, which they had formerly rejected, having (as you have heard,<note place="margin">Bede <hi>Ib. c.</hi> 22.</note>) driven away <hi>Mellitus</hi> their Bishop; for <hi>Sige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> who was now King of that Nation, having succeeded <hi>Sigebert,</hi> Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>The Little</hi>; This Prince being a Friend to King <hi>Oswye,</hi> and using to come sometimes to visit him into the Kingdom of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> he was wont often to tell him, <hi>That those could not be GODS that were the Works of Mens Hands; but that GOD was an Incomprehensible Being, Invisible, Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, and Eternal, who governed all Things both in Heaven and Earth, and would judge the World in Equity; and that all those who would learn, and do His Will, should receive Eternal Rewards:</hi> These and many other such Things, when King <hi>Oswy</hi> had often inculcated with a Brotherly Affection, at last by the Persuasion of that King, and of divers of his Friends, he also Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and was baptised, with all his Followers, at the same place where <hi>Peadda</hi> had been Christned before, (<hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Wall-Town</hi> above-mentioned). King <hi>Sigebert,</hi> being thus made a Christian, returned to his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, only asking of King <hi>Oswy</hi> to appoint him some Teachers, who might convert and baptise his Nation into the Faith of Christ; so the King sent to the Kingdom of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> and called back <hi>Cedda,</hi> who had been before sent thither; and giving him a certain Priest for his Companion, sent him to preach the Word to the <hi>East-Saxons:</hi> When these had passed through all places, and had gathered a very large Church, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned some time after, that <hi>Cedda,</hi> returning home, went to <hi>Lindisfarne,</hi> to confer with Bishop <hi>Finan</hi>; who, when he found the Work of the Gospel to have so well prospered under his Ministery, calling to him Two other Bishops, ordained <hi>Cedda</hi> Bishop over the Nation of the <hi>East-Saxons</hi>; who thereupon returned into his own Province, and finishing the Work he had begun with greater Authority, Built Churches in many places, and ordained Priests and Deacons, who might help him in the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word and Baptism; especially in a City, which is called in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The same Year also, according to the Account of an ancient <hi>British</hi> Chronicle, (lately in the Possession of Mr. <hi>Robert Vaughan,) Cadwallader,</hi> last King of the <hi>Britains,</hi> having been forced by a great Famine and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to quit his Native Country, and to sojourn with <hi>Alan</hi> King of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morica</hi>; finding no hopes of ever recovering his Kingdom, from thence went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where, professing himself a Monk, he died about 8 Years after. Now, thô the <hi>British</hi> History of <hi>Caradoc</hi> (Translated by <hi>Humphrey Lloyd,</hi> and Published by Dr. <hi>Powel,</hi>) places <hi>Cadwallader</hi>'s going to <hi>Rome Anno</hi> 680, which, Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> in the Manuscript I have by me, (and which is already cited in the former Book) proves, can neither agree with the Account of the said old Chronicle, nor yet with the Time of the great Mortality above-mentioned; for <hi>Caradoc</hi> and <hi>Geoffery</hi> of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> do both place <hi>Cadwallader</hi>'s going to <hi>Rome</hi> in the Year of the great Pestilence, which (as <hi>Bede</hi>) and <hi>Mat.

                  <hi>Oswi,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ethelfred,</hi> reigned 28 Years, and 6 Months; and whilst he reigned, there happened a great Mortality of Men, <hi>Catwalater</hi> (so he spells it) then reigning over the <hi>Britains,</hi> after his Father, and therein perished.</q> Now the Case is clear, if these Words in the Latin, <hi>Et in ea periit,</hi> have relation to <hi>Cadwallader,</hi> (as most likely they have,) considering <hi>Oswi</hi> lived 5 Years after the Year 665, wherein this Mortality raged; then <hi>Cadwallader</hi> never went to <hi>Rome</hi> at all, but died of this Plague; but of this, I dare not positively determine, since the greater part of the <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicles are so positive in <hi>Cadwallader</hi>'s dying at <hi>Rome.</hi> But to return to our <hi>Annals.</hi>

            <p>The See of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had been now vacant for above 3 Years, for the Pope was resolved himself to Ordain an Arch-Bishop; and at last, at the Recommendation of one <hi>Adrian</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> Monk, (who might have been Arch-Bishop himself, but refused it,) the Pope chose this <hi>Theodorus,</hi> then a Monk, and a Native of <hi>Tharsus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia</hi>; who, being an excellent Scholar, brought the knowledge of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, as also <hi>Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, Musick,</hi> and <hi>Astronomy,</hi> in use among the <hi>English Saxons.</hi>

Westminster</hi> says, she was expelled the Kingdom by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, who despised Female Government: But what Authority he had for this, I know not, for I do not find it in any other Author; whereas if what <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> says of her be true, it was not likely they should Rebel against so good a Governess, who seems to have been the perfect Pattern of an Excellent Queen.</p>

            <p>About this time also, according to <hi>Math.

            <p>This Year also (according to <hi>Florence</hi>) King <hi>Wulfher</hi> was first bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, but the <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> mention no such thing; and therefore I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from whence he had it, for it is quite contrary to what <hi>Bede</hi> relates, concerning his being Baptized long before; or else, How could he be Godfather to <hi>Edelwalch,</hi> King of the <hi>West Saxons,</hi> who was Baptized near 20 Years before? But I suppose <hi>Florence</hi> had it from some old Monkish Legend, if not from the <hi>Roman</hi> Martyrology it self, in which is related, that incredible Story of King <hi>Wulfher</hi>'s murdering of his two Sons, <hi>Ulf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald</hi> and <hi>Rufin,</hi> with his own Hands, because they had been instructed in the Christian Faith by <hi>Ceadda,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Litchfield.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Stow,</hi> in his Chronicle, having found the same Story in an old Ledger-Book of that Church, hath thought fit to insert it into his History; placing the Year of their Suffering in <hi>Anno</hi> 668, when all our Historians do at that time relate him to have been a Christian. But this Book adds further, That the Queen, Mother to these Princes, caused them to be buried under a great heap of Stones, and thereby gave Name to the Town of <hi>Stone</hi> in <hi>Staffordshire.</hi> I thought good to take notice of this Romance, because a greater Author, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> himself, hath also thought fit to put it into his <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>About the same time also, according to the old Book of the Abby of <hi>Abingdon</hi> in the <hi>Cottonian Librarie,</hi> the Abby of <hi>Abingdon</hi> was founded by one <hi>Hean,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Cissa,</hi> a Petty Prince under <hi>Kentwin,</hi> King of the <hi>West Saxons,</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire</hi> and <hi>Berkshire</hi>; the Place at first was called <hi>Sheove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham,</hi> and the Foundation was for no more than an Abbot, and 12 Monks, but was afterwards much increased by the Charity of succeeding Kings; being rebuilt by Abbot <hi>Ordgar</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> having been burnt and destroyed by the <hi>Danes</hi> in the time of King <hi>Alfred.</hi>

But (if this Author may be credited) they gave him a very trifling Answer, saying, <hi>That they found no Fault in him</hi>; yet would not alter what had been Decreed against him: Whereupon the Bishop, by the Consent of the rest of his Fellow-Bishops of his Province, appealed to <hi>Rome.</hi> But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly these Bishops could not at that time be many, for there were then no more in this Province than <hi>Lindisfarne,</hi> and <hi>Whitern</hi> in the <hi>Picts</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:</p>

            <p>The same Year Bishop <hi>Wilfrid</hi> returning into <hi>England,</hi> was received by <hi>Beorthwald,</hi> Nephew of <hi>Ethelred</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians,</hi>

So that before this,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCLXXIX.</note> it seems, thô the King was a Christian, yet the whole Province of the <hi>South Saxons</hi> were as yet unconverted to the Christian Faith, of which the Author of the Life of Bishop <hi>Wilfrid</hi> gives this Reason;<note place="margin">

               <hi>Bede</hi> further tells us, That then there lived a certain <hi>Irish</hi> or <hi>Scotch</hi> Monk, named <hi>Dicul,</hi> who had a little Monastery in a place called <hi>Bosanham</hi> encompassed with Woods and the Sea, where he with five or six Brethren served God in great Poverty and Humility; yet would not any of the People imitate their Lives, or hear their Preaching; but when Bishop <hi>Wilfrid</hi> preach'd the Gospel to them, he did not only free them from Eternal Torments, but also from present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, for it had not rained (as my Author says) for Three Years before in that Country; whence multitudes of the poorer sort of People daily perished by Famine; so that many becoming desperate, Forty or Fifty Men in a Company, being almost starved, would all take hands together, and at once leap down a Rock into the Sea: But on the first day of their publick Baptism, soft and plentiful showres descending, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored plenty to the Summer following; so this People casting away their Idolatry, became not only enrich'd with Spiritual, but Temporal Blessings; for when the Bishop came into this Province, and saw so dismal a Famine, he taught them how to get their livings by fishing; for though the Sea and Rivers abounded plentifully with Fish, yet had not they the Wit to make Nets to take any but Eels; whereupon the Bishop taught them, by joyning many of those small Nets together, to make them serve to catch Sea-Fish, of which they took so great a multitude, that they maintained themselves with them, till other Provisions could be had.</p>

               </note>At this time also King <hi>Edelwalch</hi> gave Bishop <hi>Wilfrid</hi> a certain Island, called <hi>Seolesen,</hi> that is (in the old <hi>English Saxon</hi>) the Island of Seales, (or Sea Calves) where <hi>Wilfrid</hi> founded a small Monastery, consisting chiefly of those Brethren he brought with him, and which his Successours hold to this day, (<hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Bede</hi>'s time;) for this place (after called <hi>Selsey</hi>:) was made the seat of the Bishop of that Province, until it was long after removed to <hi>Chichester</hi>; here Bishop <hi>Wilfrid</hi> lived, and exercised his Episcopal Functions, till the death of King <hi>Egfrid.</hi>

            <p>This Year, <hi>Theodore</hi> the Arch-Bishop summon'd a Synod at <hi>Heathfield,</hi> (now <hi>Hatfield</hi> in <hi>Hartfordshire</hi>) that he might correct divers errours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Christian Faith; but <note place="margin">

            <p>And the same Year, according to <hi>Bede</hi> and the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals, <hi>Hilda</hi> the Holy Abbess deceased at <hi>Streanshale,</hi> (now <hi>Whitby</hi> in <hi>York-shire,</hi>) which she her self had Founded; she was Grand Niece to King <hi>Edwin,</hi> and having been converted by <hi>Paulinus,</hi> had been almost ever since her Conversion a professed Nun, first in the Monastery of <hi>Cale</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Abbess of divers Nunneries in <hi>England,</hi> being esteemed a Lady of great Sanctity and Knowledge.

            <p>This Year, not long before the Death of King <hi>Egfrid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCLXXXV.</note> that Holy Man <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> was by the same King ordered to be ordained Bishop of <hi>Lindisfarne,</hi> thô he was at first chosen to be Bishop of <hi>Hagulstaed</hi> instead of <hi>Trumbert,</hi> who had been before deposed from that Bishoprick; yet because <hi>Cuthbert</hi> liked the Church of <hi>Lindisfarne</hi> better, in which he had so long convers'd,<note place="margin">Bede, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 27, 28.</note>

            </p>
            <p>But I shall now give you from <hi>Bede</hi> a farther account of the Life of this good Bishop; he had been first bred in the Monastery of <hi>Mailross,</hi> and was afterwards made Abbot of the Monastery of <hi>Lindisfarne</hi>; reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from whence, he had for a long time lived the Life of an <hi>Anchorite</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Farne,</hi> not far distant, but when there was a great Synod assembled, King <hi>Egfrid</hi> being present at a place called <hi>Twiford,</hi> near the River <hi>Alne,</hi> where Arch-Bishop <hi>Theodore</hi> presiding, <hi>Cuthbert</hi> was, by the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93814:176"/>
general consent of them all,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCLXXXV.</note> chosen Bishop; who when he could not by any Messages or Letters be drawn from his Cell; at length the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, with Bishop <hi>Trumwin,</hi> and other Noble and Religious Persons, sailed thither, where they at last, after many intreaties, prevailed upon him, to go with them to the Synod; and when he came there, thô he very much opposed it, yet he was forced to accept the Episcopal Charge, and so was consecrated Bishop the <hi>Easter</hi> following; and after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, in imitation of the blessed Appostles, he adorned his calling by his good Works; for he constantly taught the People commited to his Charge, and incited them to the love of Heaven, by his constant Prayers and Exho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tations; and, which is the chief part of a Teacher, whatsoever he Taught, he himself first practised; so having lived in this manner about Two Years, being then sensible that the time of his Death (or rather of his future Life) drew near, he again retired to the same Island, and Hermitage from whence he came.</p>
            <p>The same Year also King <hi>Egfrid</hi> rashly lead out his Army to destroy the Province of the <hi>Picts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Id. cap.</hi> 26.</note> (thô his Friends, and principally Bishop <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> did all they could to hinder it), and having now entred the Country, he was brought (before he was aware) by the feigned flight of his Enemies, between the streights of certain inaccessible Mountains, where he, with the greatest part of his Forces he had brought with him, were all cut off, in the Fortieth Year of his Age, and the Fifteenth of his Reign. And as the Year aforegoing, he refused to hear Bishop <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> who diswaded him from invading <hi>Ireland,</hi> which did him no harm; so <hi>Bede</hi> observes it was a just Judgment upon him for that Sin, that he would not hear those who would then have prevented his Ruine.</p>
            <p>From this time, the Grandeur and Valour of this Kingdom of the <hi>Northumbers</hi> began to decline; for the <hi>Picts</hi> now recovered their Country, which the <hi>English</hi> had taken away; and the <hi>Scots</hi> that were in <hi>Britain,</hi> with some part of the <hi>Britains</hi> themselves, regain'd their Liberty, which they did enjoy for the space of Forty Six Years after, when <hi>Bede</hi> wrote his History: But <hi>Alfred</hi> Brother to this King succeeding him, quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his Kingdom, thô reduced into narrower bounds: He was also a Prince very well read in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>The same Year, (as the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals relate) <hi>Kentwin,</hi> King of the <hi>West-Saxons</hi> dying, <hi>Ceadwalla</hi> began to Reign over that Kingdom, (whose Pedegree is there inserted,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> which I shall refer to another place:) and the same Year also died <hi>Lothair</hi> King of <hi>Kent</hi>; (as <hi>Bede</hi> relates) of the Wounds he had received in a Fight against the <hi>South Saxons</hi>; in which <hi>Edric,</hi> his Brother <hi>Egbert</hi>'s Son, Commanded against him, and reigned in his stead.</p>
            <p>This Year (also according to the Annals) <hi>John</hi> was consecrated Bishop of <hi>Hugulstad,</hi> and remained so till Bishop <hi>Wilfrith</hi>'s return; but afterwards Bishop <hi>Bos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> dying, <hi>John</hi> became Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> but from thence, many Years after, retired to his Monastry in <hi>Derawnde,</hi> (now called <hi>Beverlie</hi> in <hi>York-shire</hi>:) This Year it rained Blood in <hi>Britain</hi>; and also Milk and Butter were now turned into somewhat like Blood. You are here to take notice, that this Bishop <hi>John</hi> above mentioned, is the famous St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlie</hi>; of whom <hi>Bede</hi> in the next Book tells so many Miracles.</p>
            <p>But our Annals do here require some farther Illustration; for this <hi>Cead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walla</hi> here mentioned, was the Grandson of <hi>Ceawlin,</hi> by his Brother <hi>Cutha</hi>; who being a Youth of great hopes, was driven into Banishment

Bertune</hi> and <hi>Autune</hi> who for some time kept that Kingdom to themselves: the former of whom was afterwards slain by the same <hi>Cead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walla,</hi> when he became King of the <hi>West-Saxons</hi>; but the other who reigned after him, again set it free from that servitude for many Years; from whence it happen'd, that all that time they had no Bishop of their own; for when <hi>Wilfrid</hi> return'd home, they became subject to the Bishop of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> (that is, of <hi>Dorchester</hi>) which return (as the Author of <hi>Wilfrid</hi>'s Life relates) happen'd this Year, being the Second of King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Reign, who then invited him home, and restored him to his Bishoprick, as also to his Monastery at <hi>Rypun,</hi> together with all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Revenues, according to the Decree of Pope <hi>Agatho,</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Rome</hi> above mentioned; all which he enjoyed till his second Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion, as you will hear in due time.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Ceadwalla</hi> had obtain'd the Kingdom, he subdued the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> which was as yet infected with Idolatry;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCLXXXVI.</note> and therefore this King resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to destroy all the Inhabitants, and to Plant the Island with his own Subjects; obliging himself by a Vow,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Id. cap.</hi> 16.</note> (althô he himself (as it is reported) was not yet baptized,) that he would give the Fourth part of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests to God; which he made good, by offering it to Bishop <hi>Wilfrid,</hi> who was then come thither by chance out of his own Country. The Island consisted of about Two Thousand Families, and the King bestowed upon this Bishop, as much Land there as then maintained Three Hundred Families, the Care of all which the Bishop committed to one of his Clerks, named <hi>Bernwin,</hi> his Sisters Son, who was to Baptize all those that would be saved. <hi>Bede</hi> also adds, That amongst the first Fruits of Believers in that Island, there were two Royal Youths, Brothers, who were the Sons of <hi>Arwald,</hi> late King thereof; who having hid themselves for fear of King <hi>Ceadwalla,</hi> were at last discovered, and by him ordered to be slain, which when the Abbot of <hi>Reodford</hi> heard, (as having his Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery not far from thence) he went to the King, who then lay private in those Parts to be cured of the Wounds he had received in taking of the Island, and desired of him, if the Youths must needs dye, that they might first received Baptism, which the King granted; whereupon the Abbot immediately instructed, and then Baptized them; so when the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner came to put them to Death, they chearfully underwent it, because they hoped thereby to obtain an Eternal Kingdom. Thus the Isle of <hi>Wight</hi> did, (thô last of all) receive the Christian Faith, and that upon very harsh terms; as if God would make them suffer for their so long refusal of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The same Year also,</hi> Ceadwalla <hi>and</hi> Mollo (<hi>or</hi> Mull) <hi>his Brother wasted</hi> Kent. And, <hi>W. Malmesbury</hi> adds, That the occasion of this War, was to be revenged of King <hi>Edric,</hi> who had killed <hi>Lothair</hi> his Predecessour, and that falling upon that Province, now grown Esseminate with long Peace, he committed a great deal of Spoil throughout the Country; but at last meeting with the <hi>Kentish</hi> Men, was repulsed with loss.</p>

            <p>But <hi>Will. Thorne,</hi> in his Chronicle of the Abbots of St. <hi>Augustine, Cant.</hi> relates the Death of this Prince, with more Circumstances (<hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But when <hi>Ceadwalla</hi> heard this news, being extremely enraged at it, he again entred <hi>Kent,</hi> and there satiating himself with Spoil and Slaughter, when he had left nothing worth carrying away, returned home Victorious.</p>
            <p>

            <p>But King <hi>Alfred,</hi> as likewise Arch-Bishop <hi>Bertwald,</hi> and all the Bishops of <hi>Britain,</hi> being assembled in a Synod, at a place called <hi>Onestrefield</hi> or <hi>Hoster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> They sent Messengers to Bishop <hi>Wilfrid,</hi> desiring him to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; but when he came to the Synod, he could by no means agree with them, because they did not perform what they had promised by their Messengers; so that great disputes arising chiefly from those Bishops of the new Sees, who together with certain Abbots had been also set on by King <hi>Alfred,</hi> and for the sake of their own private Interests, did not desire the Peace of the Church; they also objected many false things against him which could no ways be proved; and at last decreed that the Bishop should be censured according to the Decrees of the late Arch-Bishop <hi>Theodore</hi>; whereupon Bishop <hi>Wilfrid</hi> asked them, with what Face they could prefer the Decrees of <hi>Theodore</hi> before the Apostolical Canons, which had been enjoined them from Pope <hi>Agatho,</hi> and Pope <hi>Sergius</hi>? but when no due or decent manner of speaking was observed, and that they urged him to subscribe a Resignation of his Bishoprick, and Monasteries in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and <hi>Mercia,</hi> into the hands of the Arch-Bishop, he utterly refused it, and only offered to submit to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Arch-Bishop, as far as it was agreeable with the Canons of the Holy Fathers; but at last they offered him, that if he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign his Bishoprick, he might still retain his Abbey of <hi>Ripon,</hi> and live there in quiet, provided he did not go out of the bounds of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, nor exercise any Episcopal Jurisdiction; upon which, he in a long Speech set forth his former Merits, in converting the <hi>Northumbrian</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the due observation of <hi>Easter</hi>; Then asked them for what offence they went now about to degrade him? To which the King and the Arch-Bishop replied, That he was culpable in this, and was therefore to be condemned, because he had prefer'd the Judgment of the Men at <hi>Rome</hi> before theirs; and the King then offer'd the Arch-Bishop to make him submit by force to their Judgment, but this was opposed by most of the Bishops, because he had come thither under their safe conduct; Then the Bishop retired again to King <hi>Ethelred,</hi> setting forth the hard usage which he had received at the Synod, whereupon the King promised him never to alter any thing in the Monasteries, which he had bestowed upon him, until he had sent to <hi>Rome</hi> for the Pope's Judgment of these Matters, and how he might act safely therein; but in the mean time the Arch-Bishop and the Synod did not only deprive, but also Excomunicate Bishop <hi>Wilfrid,</hi> and also all those who were in communion with him; so that none might so much as eat with them, and whatsoever they touched, was looked upon as defiled.</p>
            <p>Wherefore Bishop <hi>Wilfrid</hi> was again forced to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> there to make his appeal before the Pope, to whom he presented a long Petition.

            <p>The Bishop in his Return home with these Letters, fell so sick by the way, that he was like to dye at <hi>Melune</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where ('tis said) he had a Vision of an Angel appearing to him, which promised him restitution to his See within Four Years; so he at last arrived again in <hi>Britain,</hi> where applying himself to Arch-Bishop <hi>Bertwald,</hi> He being frighted with the Pope's Letters, which had been before sent him by Messengers, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bishop <hi>Wilfrid</hi> very kindly, and being then reconciled to him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to mitigate that harsh Judgment, given against him in the former Synod.</p>
            <p>Then the Bishop delivered his Letters to <hi>Ethelred,</hi> (who, having at that time resigned his Kingdom, was become a Monk), and so used his Interest with King <hi>Cenered,</hi> whom he had appointed King in his stead, that he promised to obey the Pope's Decrees; not long after which the Bishop likewise sent an Abbot with a Priest to King <hi>Alfred,</hi> desiring his leave to return home, and to deliver him the Pope's Letters, and the Decrees which had been made on his behalf; which Messengers thô the King civily received, yet he plainly told them, That he would do them any other Favour, but that it was in vain to trouble him any further in this matter, because whatever the Kings his Predecessours, together with his Councellours, as also the late Arch-Bishop <hi>Theodore</hi> had already judged, and what he himself, together with the present Arch-Bishop, and all the Bishops of the <hi>British</hi> Nation had lately Decreed, That he was resolved never to alter for any Letters sent (as they said) from the Apostolick See; so the Messengers returning without any success, the Bishop continued where he was for some Years: but the King it seems repented at last of this harsh Resolution, and would have altered it, as you will hereafter find.</p>

               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:93814:179"/>I have been the more exact in this transaction of Bishop <hi>Wilfrid</hi>'s, because it has never been as yet published in <hi>English</hi> before, and it also gives us a great light into the Affairs of the Church at this time; and lets us know that the Kings of <hi>Northumberland</hi> did not then think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves bound to observe the Pope's Decrees, thô made upon Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> if they were contrary to a General Synod, or Council of the whole Nation.<note place="margin">

            <p>About this time (thô it be not mentioned in <hi>Bede,</hi> nor in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicle) <hi>Ina,</hi> King of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> summoned a great Council or Synod of all the Bishops, with the Great and Wise Men of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; which, because it is the first Authentick great Council, whose Laws are come to us entire, I shall set down the Title of it as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in the First Volume of Sir <hi>H.

                  </gap>stablished, throughout our whole Dominions, and that it shall not be Lawful for the time to come, for any Ealderman, or other Subject whatever, to transgress these our Constitutions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have also given you an Extract of the chief of those Laws, as far as they relate to any thing remarkable, either in Church or State; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring you for the rest to the Laws themselves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>If a Servant do any Work on a</hi> Sunday, <hi>by Command of his Master, he shall be free, and the Master shall be amerced Thirty Shillings; but if he went about the Work without his Master's privity, he shall be beaten, or redeem the penalty; but a Freeman, if he work on that Day, without the Command of his Master, shall loose his Freedom, or pay 60 Sihillings; if he be a Priest, his penalty shall be double.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The portion or dues of the Church shall be brought in by the Feast of St.</hi> Martyn, <hi>he that payeth them not by that time, shall be amerced Forty Shillings, and besides pay twelve times their value.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>If any guilty of a capital Crime shall take refuge in a Church, he shall save his Life, and yet make recompence according to Justice and Equity; if one deserving Stripes run to a Church, the Stripes shall be forgiven him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>If any one Fight within the King's House, or Palace, he shall forfeit all his Goods, and it shall be at the pleasure of the King, whether he shall have his Life or not; he that Fights in a Church, shall pay</hi> 120 s. <hi>in the House of an Alderman, or other sage Nobleman,</hi> 60 s. <hi>whosoever shall Fight in a Villager's House paying Scot, shall be punished</hi> 30 s. <hi>and shall give the Villager</hi> 6 s. <hi>and if any one Fight in the open Field, he shall pay</hi> 120 s.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>He that on his own private account shall revenge an injury done to him, before he hath demanded publick Justice, shall restore what he took away, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides forfeit</hi> 30 <hi>Shillings.</hi>

               <hi>or redeem it according to the estimation of his Head; we call Robbers to the Number of Seven or Eight Men; from that number to Thirty Five, a band; all above, an Army.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>If a Country Boor, having been often accused of Theft, if he be at last taken, he shall have his Hand or Foot cut off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>If any one Kill another's Godfather, or God-Son, the satisfaction shall be according to his Quality and Circumstances; let the compensation due to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and that due to the Lord, for the loss of his Man, be both alike: and let the one encrease, according to the Circumstances of the Person, just as the other doth; but if he were the King's Godson, let him make satisfaction to the King, as well as the Relations; but if his Life was taken away by a Relation, then let the Money due to the Godfather be diminished, as it useth to be, when Money is paid to the Master for the Death of his Servant: If a Bishop's Son be killed, let the penalty be half so much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From which Laws we may observe that our <hi>Saxon</hi> Ancestors were strict observers of the Lord's day, and would not permit any servile Work to be done thereon: Secondly, that the superstition of Sanctuaries was very ancient in <hi>England,</hi> as well as elsewhere: Thirdly, That Theft, Murder, and all sorts of Crimes, were then redeemable by pecuniary Mulcts; either to the King, or to the Friends of the party slain, or wrong'd, or else by loss of Limbs; but there is one Law behind that is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That if any</hi> English <hi>Man, who hath lost his Freedom, do afterwards Steal, he shall be hang'd on the Gallows; and no Recompence made to his Lord; if any one Kill such a Man, he shall make no recompence on that account to his Friends, unless they redeem him within a Twelve Month.</hi> Where it appears that no <hi>English</hi> Freeman could then be hang'd for any fault but Treason, (thô that is not express'd in these Laws): but as for the last clause in these Laws, <hi>That if the Son of a Bishop be killed, the penalty should be half,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by some would prove, that Bishops were then Married, it is a mistake; for by those words are only meant a Bishop's Spiritual Son, or Godson, and not his Natural, or Conjugal Son.</p>

               <hi>This Year the</hi> Kentishmen <hi>made a League with King</hi> Ina <hi>and gave him Thirty Thousand Pounds to obtain his Friendship,</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicle here also proceeds, and gives us his <hi>Pedegree,</hi> which being not to our purpose, I omit; only, you may take notice, that he was the Son of one <hi>Ecbert,</hi> and not of the last King that Reigned.</p>

               <hi>As soon as ever he was made King, he commanded a Great Council to be sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned, at a place called</hi> Becanceld (<hi>which though it be somewhere in</hi> Kent, <hi>yet no body certainly knows where it lay, unless it were</hi> Beckanham, <hi>which lies near</hi> Surry;) <hi>at which Council</hi> Withred <hi>Himself was present, as also the Arch-Bishop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>and the Bishop of</hi> Rochester, <hi>and with them all the Abbots and Abbesses, together with many Wise and Prudent Men, who were

            </p>
            <p>This passage being found in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Copy of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals, I thought good to insert, as a Monument of the ancient power of the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as Governour of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though then under the power of the Pope in Ecclesiastical Matters. These are the chief heads of this famous Council; not do the other Copies in Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi>'s Collection, differ much from this in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals; only there follows the Subscriptions of King <hi>Wythred,</hi> and <hi>Werburge</hi> his Queen, (who Subscribed for her self, and the Prince her Son,) then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low those of the Bishops and Abbots, and after them of Five Abbesses of that Kingdom; which shews them to have been present at this Council; but whether as consenters, or voters, or else as bare witnesses, I shall not determine; but it is observable that their Names are written not only before all the Presbyters? but also before <hi>Botred,</hi> a Bishop, though of what Diocess is not specified: But to return to Civil affairs.</p>
            <p>About this time also, as <hi>Bede</hi> relates, (though no Historian hath given us the Year) <hi>Sebbi,</hi> King of the <hi>East-Saxons,</hi> being fitter for a Bishop than a King, and being at last taken with a great bodily Infirmity, preferred a private Life before a Crown, and took upon him the Habit of a Monk, with the Benediction of <hi>Waldhere,</hi>

of All,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCLXXIV.</note> they decreed these Laws should be added to the Laws and Customs of the <hi>Kentish</hi> Men: the Constitutions of this Council are called in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Title, the Judgments or <hi>Doomes</hi> of King <hi>Wightred</hi>; But thô they relate chiefly to Ecclesiastical Matters, yet I shall here insert some of the chief of them.</p>
            <p>The First Law is, <hi>That the Church shall be free, and enjoy her own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Rents, and Pensions; and that Prayer be made for the King, and his Commands obeyed, not of necessity or Compulsion, but out of good will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>If any Military Man (called there a</hi> Gesithcund-man, <hi>in the</hi> Saxon <hi>Original,) shall, after this Council is ended, despising the King's Law, and the Judicial Sentence of the Bishop's Excomunication, be taken in Adultery, let him pay to his Lord an</hi> 100 <hi>Shillings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which Law it appears, there was at this time Knights Service in <hi>England,</hi> and also, that slighting of Excomunication had no further Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Penalty, than a pecuniary Mulct.</p>
            <p>And that it was to the Lord of whom he held his Land, That he was to pay it, appears by the next Law, by which it is appointed, that if the Adulterer were a Country Man, or Villager, (called there <hi>Ceorles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>) he shall pay Fifty Shillings (to his Lord,) yea thô he do Pennance for that Sin.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>If on</hi> Saturday <hi>in the Evening, after the Sun is set; or on</hi> Sunday <hi>Evening after the same time; a Servant shall, at the Command of his Master, do any work, let his Master redeem the offence with paying Eighty Shillings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>If a Layman kill a Theif, let him lye without any</hi> Wiregild, <hi>that is, without making any satisfaction to the Friends of the party slain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This Year also the <hi>Picts</hi> slew <hi>Bert</hi> the Ealderman, <hi>H. Huntington</hi> ascribes this to the Curse of the <hi>Irish</hi> Nation, whose Churches he had in the late Invasion destroyed; for as King <hi>Egfrid</hi> Invading the Country of the <hi>Picts</hi> was there cut off; so entering their Country to revenge the Death of his Master, he was likewise slain.</q>

               <hi>Mat. Westminster</hi> calls this Ealderman, <hi>Brithric,</hi> Earl of the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> but from what Authority I know not.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude this Century with a very remarkable Transaction out of <hi>Bede,</hi> that happen'd about the latter end of it. <hi>Egbert,</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Priest, living in <hi>Ireland,</hi> being hindred by a Storm that forced him back from Preaching the Gospel (as he intended) in <hi>Germany,</hi> he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded one <hi>Wilbrode</hi> his Country man to do it; who having obtain'd the Pope's License to Preach to the <hi>Heathen</hi> Nations, he performed it first by preaching the Gospel in old <hi>Frizeland,</hi> (which then included not only those Provinces, called <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Frizeland</hi> to this day, but also <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> and divers others of the <hi>Belgic</hi> Provinces;) where he converted all those Nations to the Christian Faith, and was afterwards, at the desire of <hi>Pipin,</hi> (father to King <hi>Charles,</hi>) ordained by the Pope, Arch-Bishop of the <hi>Frisons, Anno Dom.</hi> 596: and upon his return to <hi>Rome; Pipin,</hi> being then Major of the Palace, (or General of <hi>France,</hi>) gave him for his Episcopal See that famous Castle, which is called in the Old

               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:93814:181"/>

                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCV.</note> he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the Bishop, and in all Things observe the Decree of the Apostolick See; but if he died, he enjoyn'd, who ever should succeed him, to be reconciled with that Bishop for the good of both their Souls; but this King dying, one <hi>Eardwulf</hi> succeeded him, thô but for a small time; and the Bishop going to him, and carrying that King's Son along with him, he sent Messengers before, supposing him to be his Friend; but the King being perswaded by his Councellors, and also prompted by his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Wickedness, sent the Bishop word, (binding it with an Oath.) <hi>That unless he departed his Kingdom within the space of six Days, whosoever he found of his Company should be put to Death</hi>; Not long after which harsh Message, a Plot being laid against him, he was driven out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which he had scarce enjoyed two Months, and so the Royal Youth <hi>Osred,</hi> Son of the late King <hi>Alfred,</hi> succeeded in the Kingdom, and became Bishop <hi>Wilfrid</hi>'s adopted Son.</p>
            <p>In the first Year of which King, the Author above-mentioned hath given us the following Account, concerning the Restitution of the said Bishop, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Berthwald,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> came about this time from the South, together with all the Bishops, Abbots, and Chief Men of the whole Kingdom, by the Precept of the Apostolical See, to hold a Synod at a Place lying on the East-side of the River <hi>Nid,</hi> in <hi>Northumberland</hi>; where the King, with his Bishops and Chief Men being met, the Arch-Bishop made a Speech to them, setting forth the Letters from the Pope, which Bishop <hi>Wilfrid</hi> had brought directed to himself, and which he desired might be read; the Purport whereof was to the same effect, as you have already heard: Then <hi>Aelfleda</hi> the Abbess, Daughter to the late King, as also <hi>Berechtfrid,</hi> the second Man in the Kingdom, set forth the Will of the late King, and therefore that it was fit to obey it, as well as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Apostolical See; whereupon the King, with his Great Men and all the Bishops, upon mature Deliberation, resolved to be reconciled to Bishop <hi>Wilfrid,</hi> and that his two Monasteries of <hi>Rypon</hi> and <hi>Hagulstad,</hi> together with all their Revenues, should be restored to him; and so a firm Reconciliation being made, all the Bishops departed in Peace.</p>
            <p>But yet for all this, by what <hi>Richard Prior</hi> of <hi>Hagulstad</hi> hath left us of this matter, it appears,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.

               <hi>Bede</hi> gives us there a Catalogue; being a Person (says he) admirable in all Civil, as well as Ecclesiastical and Divine Learning; and, as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> further informs us, was the first of the <hi>English Saxons</hi> who wrote <hi>Latin</hi> Verses with a <hi>Roman</hi> Genius.</p>
            <p>There is here in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals a Gap for the space of 3 Years, in which I think we may (according to <hi>H.

               <q>This Year the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals began with the Death of Bishop <hi>Aldhelm,</hi> (whom it calls Bishop of <hi>Westwude,</hi> for so <hi>Shireburne</hi> was then called,) after whom one <hi>Forther</hi> took the Bishoprick, and this year <hi>Ceolred</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the Kingdom of the <hi>Mercians</hi>; for now <hi>Kenred</hi> (King of the <hi>West Saxons</hi>) went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Offa,</hi> with him and <hi>Kenred,</hi> remained there to his Live's end; and the same year Bishop <hi>Wilferth</hi> (or <hi>Wilfred</hi>) deceased at <hi>Undale</hi>; his Body was brought to <hi>Rypon</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire.</hi>
               </q> This is the Bishop whom King <hi>Egferth</hi> long since forced to go to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There being divers Things put very close together under this Year, they will need some Explanation. This <hi>Offa,</hi> here mentioned, was (as <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 20</note> 
               <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> relate) the Son of <hi>Sigher,</hi> King of the <hi>East Saxons</hi>; who, being a young Man of a sweet Behaviour, as well as handsom Face, in the Flower of his Youth, and highly beloved by his People, and having not long before succeeded to the Kingdom, (after <hi>Sighard</hi> and <hi>Senfrid</hi> above-mentioned,) he courted <hi>Keneswith,</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of King <hi>Penda,</hi> whom he desired to marry; but it seems, not long after their Marriage, she over-perswaded him to embrace a Monastick Life, so that he now went to <hi>Rome</hi> for that End. And <hi>Bede</hi> tells us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, that both these Kings left their Wives, Relations, and Countries, for Christ's sake. But to this <hi>Offa</hi> succeeded <hi>Selred,</hi> the Son of <hi>Sigebert</hi> the Good, in the Kingdom of the <hi>East Saxons. H. Huntington</hi> proposes King <hi>Offa</hi> as a Pattern to all other Princes to follow, and makes a long Exhortation to them to that purpose; as if a King could not do GOD better Service, nor more Good to Mankind by well-governing his People, than by renouncing the World, and hiding his Head in a Cell: But such was the Fashion, or rather Humour, of that Age; and the Affairs, as well as Consciences of Princes, being then altogether Govern'd by Monks, it is no wonder if they extoll'd their own Profession, as the only One where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Salvation could certainly be obtained.</p>
            <p>But since I have already given you from <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>Stephen Heddi</hi> a large Account of Bishop <hi>Wilfred</hi>'s Life and Actions above-mentioned, I shall not need to add any more to it. He was certainly a Man who had tried all the Vicissitudes of an adverse, as well as a prosperous Fortune, having been no less than three times deprived of his Bishoprick; the first time unjustly, but whether we may say the same of both the other, seems doubtful; for let his Friends say what they will, it is evident, he was at first deprived for opposing a very good Design, <hi>viz.</hi> That of dividing

the <hi>Northumbrian</hi> Kingdom into more Diocesses,<note place="margin">

            <p>But having given you this Account of Bishop <hi>Wilfred</hi>'s Life, it is fit I say somewhat further of his Death, concerning which,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 62, 63.</note> the Author above-mentioned tells us, That having lived 4 Years in Peace after his last Restitution, he at last went to visit the Monasteries which he had founded in the South Parts of <hi>England,</hi> where he was received by his Abbots (whom he had put in) with great Joy; till coming to a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery which he had founded at <hi>Oundale</hi> in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> being there seized with the same Sickness which had often attacked him before, (thô what it was, this Author does not tell us,) he there died, having before made his Will, and given a great deal, both in ready Money and Jewels, to the Monasteries he had founded: His Body was carried with great Pomp and Attendance of many Abbots and Monks to his Abbey of <hi>Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,</hi> and there buried.</p>

            <p>About this time, according to <hi>Bede, Naitan</hi> King of the <hi>Picts</hi> being convinced by the frequent reading of divers Ecclesiastical Writers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 22.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his Error, concerning the Celebration of <hi>Easter</hi>; and that he might likewise reclaim his Subjects with greater Authority, he desired the assistance of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, and therefore sent Messengers to <hi>Ceolfrid,</hi> Abbot of the Monastery of <hi>Wyremouth,</hi> desiring some Exhortatory Letters from him, whereby he might confute those who presumed not to keep <hi>Easter</hi> at the due time; as also concerning the true manner of shaving of Priest's Crowns; he likewise desired some Architects, that might build a Church for him after the <hi>Roman</hi> fashion, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to Dedicate in honour of St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which Pious requests <hi>Ceolfrid</hi> assenting, did not only send him the Architect he desired, but also writ him a long Epistle upon those two Questions in which he desired to be satisfied, which you may see at large in <hi>Bede</hi>; where, besides many notable Arguments for keeping <hi>Easter</hi> on the first <hi>Sunday</hi> after the first Full Moon that follows the Vernal Equinox, and besides some others, there is this doughty Reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Scotch</hi> way of shaving Crowns, that it was the Tonsure of <hi>Simon Magus</hi>; and then what good Christian could not but abhor it as much as Magick it self!</p>
            <p>"This Year <hi>Guthlac</hi> dyed, as also <hi>Pipin</hi> King of <hi>France</hi>; this <hi>Guthlac</hi> here mentioned, was at first a Monk at <hi>Repandun</hi> Abbey, but afterwards professing himself an <hi>Anchorite,</hi> he retired into the Fens, and built himself a Cell, at <hi>Croyland</hi>: of him the Monkish Writers of those times relate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Miracles, of his Temptations, Sufferings by, and Victories over, Evil Spirits, which then haunted that place, at which some Years after the Abbey of <hi>Croyland</hi> was founded.</p>
            <p>The same Year also <hi>Egwin,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> founded the Abbey of <hi>Evesham</hi> upon this occasion; the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> (as the Monks relate) had appeared about this place to one <hi>Eoves</hi> a Shepheard, and not long after to the Bishop himself, having a Book in her hand, bringing two Female Attendants with her, (though who they were it seems she did not declare;) whereupon the Bishop there founded this Monastery, testifying this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the Charter of the Foundation, which you may see at large in <hi>Monast.

Spelman</hi>'s first Volume of Councils; but as for the Story related by the <hi>Magdeburg Centuriators,</hi> that the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> did then Command her Image to be set up, and worshiped in that Church, there being no colour for it in the pretended Charter of the Bishop himself, that must be certainly forged; for as Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi> has very well observed, Arch-Bishop <hi>Brightwald</hi> is said to have writ this Charter by the command of the Pope; whereas this Arch-Bishop was never at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor was the Council in which it is said to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, held, till after Bishop <hi>Egwin</hi>'s Return home into <hi>England</hi>; and as for the Kings, <hi>Kenred,</hi> and <hi>Offa,</hi> who are made to witness and confirm it, they had both of them resigned their Crowns, and gone to <hi>Rome</hi> Five Years before the date of this Charter, which is <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 714; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall pass it by as a mere Fable, since it is certain that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

            <p>But before I dismiss this Subject concerning the foundation of the Abby of <hi>Evesham,</hi> I cannot forbear taking notice of another Charter pretended to be made <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 709; by King <hi>Kenred,</hi> and King <hi>Offa</hi> above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, wherein they grant those Lands, in which the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> was supposed to appear to Bishop <hi>Egwin,</hi> for the building of a Monastery ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rule of St. <hi>Benedict</hi>; in which Charter, thô the Lands are particularly named and set out, yet it is as justly suspicious as the other, to have been forged by the Monks of that Abby in after times; as Sir <hi>H.

                  <hi>Page</hi> 210.</note> who hath Printed both these Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in his first Volume of Councils; the former of which is dated at <hi>Rome,</hi> Five Years before the other of Bishop <hi>Egwin</hi>'s, and is supposed to be subscribed by the Pope, this Bishop himself, and the two Kings; who there stile themselves, the former by the Title of King of <hi>Mercia,</hi> and the latter by that of King of the <hi>East-Angles</hi>; whereas it is apparent both from our Annals and Historians, that they had both then resigned their Kingdoms to their Successours, before they went to <hi>Rome</hi>; and, which is worse, <hi>Offa</hi> was not King of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> but of the <hi>East-Saxons,</hi> as <hi>Bede</hi> expresly relates; nor can the fault be laid upon the Transcribers, since the Error is in the Original Charter it self; neither do we read of any King of the <hi>East-Angles</hi> all that time, till King <hi>Offa,</hi> upon the Murther of King <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> seized that Kingdom; but enough, if not too much, of these Monkish Forgeries: we shall now return to our Annals.</p>

            <p>Of this King <hi>Osred</hi> above mentioned, <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> gives a very bad Character, that he stained his Reign by Debauching the Chastity of the <hi>Profess'd Nuns,</hi> and that he was at last Slain by the Treachery of his Relations, who also brought the same fate upon themselves.</p>
            <p>But this King <hi>Ethelbald</hi> above mentioned, was the Son of <hi>Alwer,</hi> and he of <hi>Eoppa,</hi> (whose pedegree is already set down.)

            <p>In this Year also (as <hi>Ingulphus</hi> in his History of the Monastery of <hi>Croy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> relates) that Abby was founded by <hi>Ethelbald,</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> in honour of St. <hi>Guthlac,</hi> the <hi>Anchorite,</hi> then lately deceased, it was for <hi>Benedictines</hi>: You may see this King's Charter in the aforesaid Authour, whereby he granted to this Monastery, the whole Isle of <hi>Croyland,</hi> then containing Four Leagues in length, and Three in breadth, with all the Marshes adjoyning, there particularly mentioned.</p>

               <hi>H. Huntington</hi> tells us, That the reason why Queen <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> destroyed this Castle, was, because <hi>Eadbert,</hi> a Rebellious Prince of the Blood Royal, had taken it; and made it the seat of this Rebellious War.</p>
            <p>It being now (according to <hi>Bede</hi>) the Seventh Year of the Reign of <hi>Osric</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi>

                  <hi>Ina</hi> fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with the <hi>South-Saxons,</hi> and there slew <hi>Eadbert Aetheling,</hi> whom he had before banished.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>H.

            <p>Also the same Year, King <hi>Ina</hi> new built the Ancient Monastery of <hi>Glastenbury,</hi> endowing it with divers Lands, and also granted it an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption

from all Episcopal Jurisdiction, with divers other priviledges, as you may find in his Charter, confirmed by a great Council of the whole <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Kingdom; the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Baldred,</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> with divers other Bishops and Great Men being present, and subscribing to it in the presence of all the Lay-people.</p>
            <p>This Charter is in the Manuscript, in the Library of <hi>Trinity</hi> Coll. in <hi>Cambridge</hi>; and is also Printed by Sir <hi>H.

            <p>About this time (as <hi>Ranulph</hi> of <hi>Chichester</hi> in <hi>Polychronichon</hi> relates) that <hi>Ina,</hi> King of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> first confered upon St. <hi>Peter</hi> (that is the Bishop of <hi>Rome)</hi> a Penny from every House in his Kingdom, which was called by the <hi>English-Saxons-Romescot</hi>; and in Latin <hi>Donarius Sancti Petri,</hi> i. e. <hi>Peterpence,)</hi> which is also allowed by <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> in his History (who was once the Pope's Collector of this Tax in <hi>England</hi>;) but since I do not find this confirmed by any Ancient Authour or Council, I suspend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and <hi>H.

                  <hi>My Lord and Husband,</hi> See what is become of all that Feasting and Magnificence we saw Yesterday, Are they not all gone and past, like Water that runs into the Sea? so of all those Vanities there remains nothing, but this Dung and Filth, that only serves to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the Corruption of the Soul by such Excesses; think then Sir,

how soon that Flesh will rot that is now pamper'd,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCXXVIII.</note> by Luxury; and the greater and more powerful we are, the greater will our Torments be hereafter.</q> She needed to say no more, for she had now brought over her Husband to her Sentiments, which she had for some Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore constantly instill'd, thô hitherto in vain; thus after so many warlike Triumphs, being at the highest pitch of Humane Felicity, he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he shewed not the least Pride in his Conversation, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exposing himself to publick view; being there shorn a Monk, grew old in that mean Habit; nor was his Wife, who had been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of this Resolution, wanting in following the same Example, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying him thither her self, comforting him, and confirming him in that Course he had undertaken by her own Example; so not living far from each other in Mutual Love, they at last departed this Life, not without doing divers Miracles, if our Author may be credited.</p>

            <p>But as for the state of Civil Affairs, when <hi>Bede</hi> finished his History, he gives us this brief Account, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That <hi>Ceolwulf</hi> (who was then King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi>) had been in the beginning of his Reign per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with great Troubles, the end of which <hi>Bede</hi> could not then foresee; the Nation of the <hi>Picts</hi> at this time kept their league, with the <hi>English</hi> Nation, and rejoyced to be partakers of the Catholick Peace and Truth with the Universal Church:</q> This he speaks because <hi>Natan</hi> King of the <hi>Picts,</hi> had been but a little before brought over to imbrace the <hi>Romish</hi> observation of <hi>Easter,</hi> and to their manner of shaving Priest's Crowns.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Also the <hi>Scots,</hi> who Inhabit <hi>Britain,</hi> being kept in within their own limits, did practise no Treachery against the <hi>English</hi> Nation; as, to the <hi>Britains,</hi> thô the greatest part, from a natural hatred to the <hi>English</hi> Nation, did oppose the Catholick observation of <hi>Easter,</hi> yet the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, as well as Human Force, being against them, they could not obtain their desires; for though they were partly at their own disposal, yet were they in great measure subject to the <hi>English</hi>; in this Peaceable and quiet time, the most part of the <hi>Northumbrian</hi> Nation, as well Nobles as Private Persons, chose rather to make themselves and their Children Monks, than to Educate them in a Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Life; which (says he) What end it will have, the next Age will shew.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And so indeed it did, not long after <hi>Bede</hi>'s Death, for when the best Men thus retired into Monasteries, none but the worser, or meaner sort being left, they soon fell into horrid Rebellions and Civil Wars; one King driving out, and Murdering another, leaving the People an easie Prey to the <hi>Danes,</hi> who in the next Generation Invaded them: This (as <hi>Bede</hi> relates) was the Present State of <hi>Britain,</hi> in his Time, about 285 Years after the Arrival of the <hi>English Saxons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We being now bereft of the assistance of so good an Authour, must for the future wholly rely upon the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals, together with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Monkish Writers; thô indeed for near the space of above Thirty Years last past, <hi>Bede</hi> growing more intent upon Ecclesiastical than Civil Affairs, (being all most wholly taken up with the reciteing of Visions and Miracles,) and mentioning other things only by the bye, hath given us so slender an account of those times, that if we had not found some assistance from the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals, (as well as from other Writers,) the History of that Age, though very short and obscure, would yet have been much more imperfect without them.</p>

               <q>This Year K. <hi>Ethelbald</hi> took <hi>Sumerton</hi>; and <hi>Acca</hi> was driven from his Bishoprick of <hi>Hagulstad,</hi> (I suppose by the then King of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> though no Author expresly mentions it.)</q> 
               <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> tells us, that this <hi>Ethelbald</hi> was that great and powerful King of the <hi>Mercians</hi>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:93814:186"/>
to whom <hi>Boniface,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCXXXIII.</note> Bishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> (being then the Pope's Legat,) writ a sharp Letter, setting forth, and reproving, the then reigning Vices of this Nation, and particularly of that King himself; who, relying on the vain Confidence of his Justice and Alms, was not ashamed (no more than the Noblemen of his Kingdom, by his Example,) to commit Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness even with Consecrated Nuns, which wicked Actions the Bishop foretells would be the ruin of himself and Kingdom, as it proved in the end.</p>
            <p>But King <hi>Ethelbald,</hi> after he had thus taken <hi>Somerton,</hi> with an Army too powerful to be resisted by the K. of the <hi>West Saxons,</hi> became to great, that (as <hi>H. Huntington</hi> observes,) he made all the rest of the Provinces of <hi>England,</hi> together with their Kings, subject to him, as far as the River <hi>Humber:</hi> This <hi>Somerton</hi> was anciently a great Town and Castle of the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Kings, and gave Name to that County, which we now call <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> though at present it be but an ordinary Country Village. Also this Year the Sun was so much eclipsed, that (as the Epitome of <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> relate,) on 13<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Kal. Sept.</hi> its whole Orb seem'd as it were covered with a black Sheild.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCXXXIV.</note>This Year also the Moon appear'd as it were stain'd with Blood, and <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> saith it lasted one whole hour, and then a Blackness following, it return'd to its natural Colour. <q>Also <hi>Tatwin</hi> the Archbishop deceased; and <hi>Egbryht</hi> was made Bishop of <hi>York:</hi> Now <hi>Bede</hi> also died.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But the Author of his Life (in Manuscript in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library) refers it to the Year following; and the Chronicle of <hi>Mailros,</hi> with greater Truth, to the Year 736; for he was (as his Life above-cited relates,) born <hi>Anno</hi> 677, and deceased in the 59th Year of his Age.</p>
            <p>But since <hi>Bede</hi> our Historian deceased about this time; and that it is to him we are beholding for the greatest part of the History of this present Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, it is fit we give you a short account of his Life; He was born in the Province of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> not far from the Monastery of <hi>Gyrwie</hi> (the place is now called <hi>Yarrow,</hi>) near the Mouth of the River <hi>Were,</hi> where he was bred up from seven Years of Age, and in which, being profess'd, he lived a Monk all the rest of his Life, spending his time in the Study of the Scriptures, saying his Prayers, or Writing Comments upon the Old and New Testaments, as also his Ecclesiastical History, (so often cited by us,) besides divers other Books, containing the Lives of Saints, and other Matters, of Humane, as well as Divine Learning; whose Titles you may find at the end of his said History: 'Till at last, being wasted by a long Asthma, he there made an Heavenly End, as may be seen in his Life above-mentioned: So that <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> very well observes, that though he lay, as it were, hid in the utmost Corner of the World, yet, after his Death, he became known in all Parts by his Learned Writings; therefore he hath, for his great Piety, as well as Learning, justly obtained the Title of <hi>Venerable Bede:</hi> After whose decease, (as <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> rightly observes,) all knowledge of Actions passed was almost lost even to his own Times, since none proved an Emulator of his Studies, nor a Follower of his Learning; so that to a slothful Generation, one more slothful still succeeding, the Love of Learning for a long time grew cold in this whole Island.</p>

            <p>'The Arch-bishop <hi>Nothelm</hi> received his Pall from <hi>Rome:</hi>] This was the new Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Tatwine.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>You may take notice, that it was in those Times usual for the Pope to send a Pall to every new Archbishop upon his Consecration, to shew his Dependance upon the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and for which every Archbishop paid a great Sum of Money to the Pope's Treasury.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Nothelm,</hi> when he was a Presbyter of the Church of <hi>London,</hi> was he, to whom <hi>Bede,</hi> in the Epistle before his History, owns himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding for divers ancient Monuments relating to the <hi>English</hi> Church, as also Epistles out of the Pope's Repository.</p>

                  <hi>Ceolwulf,</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> surrendred his Kingdom to <hi>Eadbert</hi> his Cousin, who reigned Thirty one Years:</q> (This <hi>Ceolwulf</hi> was he to whom <hi>Bede</hi> dedicated his History; who, after his professing himself a Monk in the Monastery of <hi>Lindisfarne,</hi> (as <hi>R. Hoveden</hi> relates) brought the Monks of that place from the strict discipline of drinking only Milk or Water, to drink Wine, and Ale, and they might very well afford it, for he brought along with him good provisions to live easily, as great Treasures and Revenues in Land (recited at large by <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi>) all which he bestowed on that Monastery; no wonder then if such great Commendations be given by Monkish Writers to Kings becoming Monks.</p>

Pride and Ambition (says he) inciting the <hi>Mercians,</hi> and fear of Servitude provoking the <hi>West Saxons,</hi> to fight it to the last; but wherever Earl <hi>Ethelune</hi> charged the Enemies, he with the force of his invincible Battle-Axe destroyed all before him; but at last K. <hi>Ethelbald</hi> and the Earl meeting, they fought together with great Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy and Resolution; till GOD, who resisteth the Proud, so discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged this King, that he turned his Back, and fled, whilst his Men still fought on; yet at last they were all routed; nor from that time, to the day of his Death, did GOD give him any more Success.</p>

               <q>This Year was very remarkable, for now (as our <hi>Annals</hi> inform us) <hi>Cynwulf,</hi> with the Wife and Noble Men of the <hi>West Saxons,</hi> deprived King <hi>Sigebert</hi> of the whole Kingdom for his Cruelty and Injustice, (except <hi>Hampshire,)</hi> which he kept for some time, until he slew one <hi>Cumbran</hi> an Ealderman, (who had continued longest with him;) so that at last <hi>Sigebert</hi> was driven into <hi>Andred</hi>'s Wood, where he remained till such time as a certain Hogheard ran him through with a Lance at <hi>Pruutes-Flood,</hi> and thereby revenged the Death of <hi>Cumbran</hi> the Ealder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.

            <p>
               <hi>H. Huntington</hi> is very particular in the Reasons, and manner of King <hi>Sigebert</hi>'s Deposition. and tells us, That being puff'd up with the good Succ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ss of his Predecessours, he grew intollerable to his Subjects; for he had oppressed them by all manner of ways, and wrested the Laws for his own Advantage, insomuch that this <hi>Cumbran</hi>; one of his noblest Earls, at the Desire of the People, represented their Grievances to this cruel King, who, because he perswaded him, that he should govern them

                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCLV.</note> he presently commanded him to be slain, and so daily increased in his Tyranny, till in the beginning of his Second Year, the Great Men and People of the whole Kingdom being gathered together, by the Provident Deliberation, and Unanimous Consent of them All he was expell'd the Kingdom; and <hi>Cinewulf,</hi> a notable young Man of the Blood Royal, was <hi>Elected</hi> King in his room.</p>
            <p>This is the first Example we have in our <hi>English</hi> History, of the Solemn Deposition of a King, by the Authority of the Great Council of the Kingdom, concerning whom our Author bids us remark the manifold Justice and Providence of God, how sometimes it doth not only recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence Kings according to their Merits in the World to come, but also in this; for oftentimes setting up Wicked Kings for the Deserved Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Subjects, he lets some of them Tyrannize a great while, that so a wicked People might be punished, and the King becoming more wicked, may be tormented for ever; as may be seen in <hi>Aethelbald,</hi> King of <hi>Mercia</hi> above-mentioned, whilst God cuts others short by a speedy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, lest his People, being oppress'd by too great Tyranny, should not be able to subsist under it, so that the immoderate Wickedness of a Prince does often accelerate his Punishment.</p>
            <p>The same Year, (according to <hi>Caradoc</hi>'s Chronicle published by Dr. <hi>Powel,) Conan Tindaethwy,</hi> Son of <hi>Rodri Molwynoc,</hi> began his Reign over the <hi>Britains</hi> in <hi>Wales.</hi>

               <q>This Year also, (according to the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals,) <hi>Aethelbald,</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> was slain at <hi>Seccandune</hi> (now <hi>Secington</hi>) in <hi>Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> after he had reigned 41 Years; and then <hi>Beornred</hi> usurped the Kingdom, and held it but a little while, and that with great Trouble; for the same year King <hi>Offa</hi> expelled <hi>Beornred,</hi> and taking Possession of the Throne, held it 39 Years; but his Son <hi>Egberth</hi> no more than 140 Days.

            </p>
            <p>Abbot <hi>Bromton</hi>'s Chronicle farther adds, concerning the Death of King <hi>Ethelbald,</hi> That he was slain in a Fight at the Place above-mention'd, yet was it not by the Enemy, but by the Treachery of this <hi>Beornred.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ingulph,</hi> in his History of <hi>Croyland,</hi> tells us, That King <hi>Ethelbald</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving founded the Abby of <hi>Ripendune</hi> (now <hi>Repton</hi>) in <hi>Derbyshire,</hi> (being the most famous of that Age,) was there buried; and also of this <hi>Beorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> (whom he calls a Tyrant,) that he did not long enjoy his Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for it seems he was not of the Blood Royal of the <hi>Mercian</hi> Kings; but when he was Expelled, <hi>Offa</hi> succeeded him by the General Consent of the Nobles of <hi>Mercia</hi>; but <hi>Mat. Westminster</hi> (who puts the Succession of King <hi>Offa</hi> two Years later) is more particular in this Transaction, and relates, That this <hi>Beornred</hi> governing very Tyrannically, the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Mercians</hi> rose up against him; so that both the Nobility and Commons joyning together, under the Conduct of <hi>Offa,</hi> a valiant young Man, Nephew to the late King <hi>Aethelbald,</hi> they expelled <hi>Beornred</hi> the Kingdom; and then <hi>Offa,</hi> by the General Consent of the Clergy and Laity of that Kingdom, was crowned King.

            <p>Concerning this <hi>Eadbert, Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> in his History of that Church, tells us, That after he had reigned 21 Years, and ruled his Kingdom with great Wisdom and Courage, so that all his Adversaries being either overcome by force, or else submitting themselves to him; the <hi>English, Pictish,</hi> and <hi>Scotish</hi> Kings, not only maintained Peace and Friendship with him, but rejoyced to do him Honour; so that the Fame of his Grandeur spreading as far as <hi>France,</hi> King <hi>Pipin</hi> not only made a League with him, but sent him great Presents; and the Kings, his Neighbours, when he was about to resign the Crown, had him in that Esteem, that they offered him part of their own Dominions, on Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he would not lay down his Charge; but he refused it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed his Kingdom to <hi>Usulf,</hi> his Son.</p>

            <p>
               <q>In the Reign of King <hi>Offa</hi> there was a certain Abbot of <hi>Medesham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead,</hi> called <hi>Beonna,</hi> who, with the Consent of the Monks of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery, leased out to <hi>Cuthbriht</hi> the Ealderman, <hi>X Bonde-land</hi> (that is, the Ground of ten Bond-men, or Villains,) at <hi>Swinesheafde,</hi> with the Meadows and Pastures, and all other Things thereunto belonging; upon this Condition, That <hi>Cuthbriht</hi> should pay the Abbot Fifty Pounds, and one Night's Entertainment every Year, or else Thirty Shillings in Money; and that after his Death the Lands should again revert to the Monastery: To which Grant, King <hi>Offa,</hi> King <hi>Egferth,</hi> Arch Bishop <hi>Higebert,</hi> the Bishop <hi>Ceolwulf,</hi> the Bishop <hi>Inwona,</hi> with <hi>Beon</hi> the Abbot, and many other Bishops, Abbots, and Great Men, were Witnesses.</q> I have inserted this Passage, thô it does not relate to the Civil History of these Times, because it is the First Example of a Lease of this kind, and seems to have been done in a great Council of the Kingdom, where these Kings were present, which was then necessary for such a Grant.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Also in the time of this King <hi>Offa,</hi> (as the <hi>Peterburgh</hi> Copies relate,) there was a certain Ealderman, called <hi>Brordan,</hi> who desired of the King, That for his sake he would free a certain Monastery of his, called <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingas,</hi> because he intended to give it to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and to the Church

                  </note> That none of their Relations were dearer to them than their own Lord, and they would never obey his Murderers; and they then farther told their Kinsmen, That if they would leave their Leader, they should all be safe, from whom they also received this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That the like had been already promised to those who were of the King's Party; and said, That as they then refused their promise, so themselves should now refuse the like from them, then they fought at the Gates until they were broken open, and the Conspirators forced to retire within them, but there <hi>Cyneard Aetheling</hi> was Slain, and all those that were with him, except one, who was the <hi>Ealderman</hi>'s God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to whom, being grievously wounded, he granted his Life.

            <p>The second of these Decrees is, That Baptism be performed at the times appointed by the former Canons of the Church, and no other; and that all Men in general learn the Creed and the Lord's Prayer; that God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers shall be answerable for those Children for whom they stand, till they come to Years capable of learning the Creed and the Lords Prayer.</p>
            <p>The Twelfth Canon is, That in the Election or Ordination of Kings, no Man should permit the Assent or Vote of Evil Men to prevail; but Kings shall be Lawfully Elected by the Clergy and Elders of the People, not begot of Adultery or Incest; because, as in our times, an Adulterer according to the Canons cannot arrive to the Priest-hood, so neither can he be the Lord's Anointed, and the Heir of his Country,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:93814:192"/>
and King of the whole Kingdom,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom. DCCXXXVI.</hi>
               </note> who is not begot of Lawful Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. The rest of it is for rendering Honour and Obedience to Kings, without speaking Evil of them, and the chief Texts out of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> are cited to that purpose. It is also there forbid, That any Man should conspire the Death of the King, because he is the <hi>Lord's Anointed</hi>; and if any shall be guilty of that wickedness; if he be a Bishop or one in Priest's Orders, he shall be deprived, as <hi>Judas</hi> was cast out from his Apostleship: There is also here likewise cited out of Scripture several examples of those that have been punished either for conspiring the Death of Kinsg, or having actually kill'd them.</p>
            <p>The Sixteenth Canon is, That Bastards, and those begotten of Nuns, shall not inherit, which is the first Decree we find of this kind.</p>
            <p>The Seventeenth Canon is, That Tythes shall be paid according to the Scriptures, <hi>viz. Thou shalt bring the Tenth part of all thy encrease, when thou bringest thy first fruits into the House of the Lord thy God</hi>; there is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise cited the Text in <hi>Malachi Chap.</hi> 3. concerning the paying of Tythes, and therefore, says the Canon, we exhort all Men, that they pay Tythes of whatsoever they possess; because it is God's special Commandment, that every Man live, and give Alms of the other 9 parts.</p>
            <p>Whence you may observe, that as this is the first Decree of any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in <hi>England,</hi> concerning payment of Tythes, so also is it hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that they are due by Divine Right.</p>
            <p>The Nineteenth Decree is, against Mens observing any Pagan Rites, and particularly of making marks and scars in any part of their Bodies for any false God. There are also other Decrees which seem very trivial, as against cutting off Horses Ears, or Tails, and slitting their Noses; as also against eating Horse-flesh, which it seems was then much in fashion amongst the Common sort of People; as also against casting of Lots for the deciding of Civil Controversies.</p>
            <p>It also here appears by the Address of the Pope's Legates, made to him at the end of this Council, that there were two distinct Sessions of it; the first was held before King <hi>Aelfwald,</hi> and Arch Bishop <hi>Eanbald,</hi> and all the Bishops belonging to the <hi>Northumbrian</hi> Kingdom; as also all the Senators, Ealdermen, and People of that Country, who when these Decrees were proposed to them, did all of them with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion promise to observe them, and subscribed them with the Sign of the Cross. Then follow the subscriptions of the King, the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>York,</hi> and the rest of the Bishops of that Province; after them follow also the Subscriptions of the Presbyters and Deacons of Churches, Judges, Chief and Noble Men, some of whom do there subscribe for all the rest.</p>
            <p>Where this Council was held for the Kingdom of <hi>Northumberland</hi> is uncertain; but the second Session of it was held at <hi>Calcuith,</hi> now sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be in the Kingdom of <hi>Mercia,</hi> which, as also in the conclusion of this Council, it is thus recited; <q>King <hi>Offa</hi> with all the Senators of his Kingdom, with <hi>Janbryht,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the other Bishops of that Province, the same Decrees being read before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, as well in <hi>Latin</hi> as in <hi>Saxon,</hi> so that all might understand them, they all agreed with one accord to observe them; then follow the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions of King <hi>Offa,</hi> and the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with divers of the Nobles there present, who subscribed in the name of all the rest.</q>

            <p>The same Author further adds, That also in this Council, <hi>Offa</hi> the most potent King of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> did then cause his Eldest Son <hi>Egfred,</hi> a Comely and Valiant Young Man, and endued with all good Qualities, to be solemnly Crowned King; who obeying his Father in all things, Reigned together with him so long as he lived.</p>
            <p>But it is very observable, that neither <hi>Alrich,</hi> then King of <hi>Kent,</hi> nor any of his Deputies, did appear at this Council; for which I can give no other Reason, than that this King did not approve of the Removal of the chief Archiepiscopal See from <hi>Canterbury</hi> in his own Dominions, to <hi>Litchfield</hi> in another Prince's Territories.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> observes, This Violence done to the See of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thô it lasted all the Reign of King <hi>Offa,</hi> and also during the Life-time of Arch-Bishop <hi>Janbryht,</hi>

                  <hi>De Pontif. l.</hi> 1.</note> who spared neither cost nor pains to get his See restored to its Ancient Dignity; yet was it all to no purpose, till such time as <hi>Kenwulf,</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> restored the Arch-Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to its former Rights, <hi>Litchfield</hi> becoming again an ordinary Bishoprick, subject to the See of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to this day, having continued an Arch-Bishoprick only during the times of two Arch-Bishops, <hi>viz.</hi> for the space of about Eleven Years. But it is time to return to Civil Affairs.</p>
            <p>The same Year (as <hi>H. Huntington</hi> relates) the Sign of the Cross ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared of it self upon Mens Cloaths, which (if true) is wonderful to future Ages.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Brithric</hi> now married <hi>Eadburghe,</hi> the Daughter of King <hi>Offa,</hi> which was done (as <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury relates</hi>) to strengthen his Interest with his Neighbouring Princes; also about those times (as <hi>Ethelwerd,</hi>

               <q>This Year there was a general Synod assembled at <hi>Pyncanhale,</hi> or <hi>Finken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale,</hi> (now <hi>Finkley</hi> in the Bishoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> then part of the Kingdom of <hi>Northumberland</hi>) where <hi>Eanbald</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> presided: whose Decrees you may see in Sir <hi>H.

            <p>This Year also, (according to the Annals) <hi>Albert</hi> the Abbot deceased; and King <hi>Charles</hi> passed through <hi>Almany,</hi> to the very Borders of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> (as the <hi>Latin</hi> Text of the <hi>Laudean</hi> Copy relates.)</p>

            </p>
            <p>This King is said by <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> and <hi>Roger Hoveden,</hi> to have been a very Just and Worthy Prince, and that he was Slain by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of this <hi>Sicga,</hi> who was one of his chief Noblemen, and being Murthered at <hi>Cilceaster,</hi> (near the <hi>Pict</hi>'s Wall,) there was frequently seen a Light from Heaven over the Place, where he was Slain: He was buried in the Cathedral Church of <hi>Hagulstad,</hi> with great Solemnity, and there was afterwards a Church built in the Place where he was killed: and <hi>Osred,</hi> the Son of <hi>Alchr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The same Year likewise (according to <hi>Mat.

            <p>
               <q>Now <hi>Janbryht</hi> the Archbishop deceased, and <hi>Ethelheard</hi> the Abbot was elected Archbishop.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCXC.</note> Also <hi>Osred,</hi> King of the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> was betray'd, and driven out of his Kingdom; and <hi>Ethelred,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ethelwald</hi> (Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Mull,</hi>) reigned after him, or rather was again restored to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, having reigned there before, as hath been already shewn.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> adds farther, that this <hi>Osred,</hi> the late King of this Kingdom, having been also shaven a Monk against his Will, escaped again out of the Monastery, into the <hi>Isle of Man.</hi> But the next Year,</p>

            <p>Also about this time, (according to the same Author,) one <hi>Eardulf,</hi> an Earl, being taken and brought to <hi>Ripun,</hi> was there Sentenced by the said King to be put to Death, without the Gate of the Monastery; whose Body, when the Monks had carried to the Church, with solemn Dirges, and placed under a Pavilion, was about Midnight found alive. But this Relation is very imperfect, for it neither tells us how he escaped Death; nor how he was conveyed away, though we find him five Years after this made King of <hi>Northumberland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Year (as <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Mat. Westminster</hi> relate,) <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> sent certain <hi>Synodal</hi> Decrees into <hi>England</hi>; in which alas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (for with great Grief, our Author speaks it) were found many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent things, and altogether contrary to the true Faith: For it had been decreed in a Council at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> by more than Three Hundred Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:93814:193"/>
that Images ought to be adored,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> CCXCI.</note> which the Church of God does (say they) wholly abominate.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Albinus,</hi> (that is our <hi>Alcuin,</hi>) wrote an Epistle, wherein he proved it by the Authority of the Holy Scriptures to be utterly Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and this he offered, together with the Book it self, to the King of <hi>France,</hi> on the behalf of all our Bishops and Great Men;<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Sir.</hi> H.

            <p>From which it is evident, that Image-Worship, as now practised in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Churches, was not then received in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Year also, according to the same Author, <hi>Osred,</hi> late King of <hi>Nortbumberland,</hi> being deceived by the Oaths of some great Men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned privately from the Isle of <hi>Man</hi>; when, his Souldiers deserting him, and being taken Prisoner by King <hi>Ethelred,</hi> he was by his Command put to Death, at a Place called <hi>Aynsburg</hi>; but his Body was buried at the famous Monastery at the mouth of <hi>Tine</hi>; and the same Year King <hi>Ethelred</hi> betrothed <hi>Elfrede</hi> the Daughter of King <hi>Offa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In whom also there was found as little Faith as Mercy; for this Year,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCXCII.</note> according to our Annals, <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and <hi>Mat. Westminster; Ethelbert,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ethelred,</hi> King of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> notwithstanding the disswasions of his Mother, going to the Court of King <hi>Offa,</hi> in order to Wooe his Daughter, was there slain, by the wicked instigations of Queen <hi>Quendrith</hi>; so that out of an Ambition to seize his Kingdom, <hi>Offa</hi> was perswaded to make him away; but by what means it is not agreed: The Annals relate him to have been beheaded.</p>
            <p>But the same Annals, and <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> agree, <q>That his Body was buried (in the Monastery) at <hi>Tinmouth.</hi>
               </q> But the Chronicle ascribed to Abbot <hi>Bromton,</hi> as also <hi>Mat. Westminster,</hi> have given us long and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendary Accounts of the Death of this Prince; and the latter of these, as well as other Monks, who were favourers of this King <hi>Offa,</hi> would have this Murther to be committed without this King's knowledge; and <hi>Mat. Westminster</hi> has a long Story about it, but not all probable, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially since the King was so well pleased with the Fact when it was done, that he presently seized the Kingdom of this poor Murthered Prince, and added it to his own Dominions.</p>
            <p>This Year, (as <hi>Mat. Paris,</hi> and his Namesake of <hi>Westminster</hi> relate,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCXCIII.</note>) King <hi>Offa</hi> was warned by an Angel to remove the Reliques of St. <hi>Alban</hi> into a more noble Shrine; and so either for this cause, or else (which is more likely) to expiate the several Murthers he had committed, began to build a new Church and Monastery in honour of St. <hi>Alban,</hi> and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther removing his Bones, into a Silver shrine all gilt and adorned with precious Stones, he placed them in the new Church that he had built without the Town: where (as the Monks pretended) they wrought great Miracles.</p>
            <p>This King having made a journey on purpose to <hi>Rome,</hi> obtained of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> to have him Canonized: King <hi>Offa</hi> also conferred upon this Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery very great Privileges, and vast Possessions, all which he confirmed by his Charter, which you may find in the first Volume of <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Monast. Anglic.</hi> as that also, <hi>Anno. Dom.</hi> 1154. One <hi>Nicholas</hi> having been first a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in this Abbey, and afterwards was Bishop of <hi>Alba,</hi> Elected Pope by the name of <hi>Adrian</hi> IV: he by his Bull ordained, that, as St. <hi>Alban</hi>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:93814:194"/>
was the first Martyr of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCXCIII.</note> so this Abbot should be the first in Dignity of all the Abbots in <hi>England</hi>; and Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> did by a Bull in the Year 1118, not only ratifie all the Privileges made and confirmed by former Popes, but also granted to the Abbot and his Successours Episcopal Rights, together with the Habit; and that he and his Monks should be exempt from all Jurisdiction to the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> with other Exemptions too long here to be set down.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Also this Year there appeared strange Prodigies in the Country of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> which mightily terrified the People of that Province; (<hi>viz.</hi>) immoderate Lightnings; there were also seen Meteors like fiery Dragons, flying in the Air; after which signs followed a cruel Famine; and a little after, the same Year (<hi>6<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Idus Jan.</hi>) certain Heathens (i.e. <hi>Danes</hi>) miserably destroyed the Church of God in <hi>Lindisfarne,</hi> committing great Spoils and Murthers.</q> 
               <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> says, These <hi>Danes</hi> not only pillaged that Monastery, but killing divers of the Friers, carried away the rest Captive, sparing neither Priests nor Laymen. <q>This Year also <hi>Sicga</hi> died; he who killed the good King <hi>Alfwold,</hi> who now (as <hi>Roger Hoveden</hi> relates) slew himself.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And the same Year, (according to <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,) Ethelard</hi> was ordained Arch-Bishop of <hi>York</hi>; and (as <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> relates) the same Year died <hi>Alric,</hi> Third Son to <hi>Withred,</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> after a long Reign of Thirty Four Years; in whom ended the Race of <hi>Hengist</hi>: Thenceforth, (as <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> observes,) whomsoever Wealth or Faction advanced, took on him the Title of King of that Province.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCXCIV.</note>
               <q>This Year both Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> and <hi>Offa,</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> departed this Life; the Latter after he had Reigned Forty Years.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding the Printed Copies of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals, have placed the King's Death under this Year: Yet the rest of the Copies do not agree with this Account; for the <hi>Laudean</hi> Manuscript Copy, in the <hi>Bodlean</hi> Library places this King's Death in <hi>Anno. Dom.</hi> 896; and that with greater Truth; for first Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> above-mentioned died not till Two Years after the time here specified. And, it appears farther in a Letter written by the Emperour <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> to this King <hi>Offa</hi>; and which is recited at large by <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> in his Life of this King, that Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> was dead some time before the date of that Letter: <hi>viz. Anno. Dom.</hi> 796; Thô it is certain, King <hi>Offa</hi> did not survive long after.</p>
            <p>I thought to give the Reader notice of this, because it puts the Death of this King, and the Succession of all his Successours, just Two Years later than the common Printed Accounts: But whenever this King here died, he is said by <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> to have been buried in a Chapel at <hi>Bedford,</hi> near the River <hi>Ouse</hi>; whose frequent Inundations had in his time, carried away both the Chapel, and the Tomb into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: So that it could not be seen, unless sometimes by those who washed themselves in that River.</p>
            <p>This Prince is also described by the same Author, to have had so great a Mixture of Vertues and Vices, that he does not know well what Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to give him: The Reason that so confounded him, was, That thô he was a Cruel and Perfidious Prince, yet he Built the Monastery of St. <hi>Albans</hi> (as you have heard,) but for all that he cannot give him many good words, because he took away abundance of good Farms from his Abbey. This seems to have been the first of our <hi>English Saxon</hi> Kings, who maintained any great correspondence with Foreign Princes; for thô he
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:93814:194"/>
had first great Enmity with <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, which proceeded so far,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCXCIV.</note> as to the interdicting of all Commerce, yet at last it was changed into as much Amity; so that a firm League was made between them, as appears by a Letter of the said <hi>Charles</hi> to <hi>Offa,</hi> extant in <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> in which also is mentioned, that he sent him many Noble Presents. Also he granted (saith <hi>Henry Huntington)</hi> a perpetual Tribute to the Pope out of every House in his Kingdom, and this, perhaps, for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to translate the Primacy from <hi>Canterbury</hi> to <hi>Litchfield</hi> in his own Dominions. He also drew a Trench of a wondrous length between <hi>Mercia</hi> and the <hi>British</hi> or <hi>Welsh</hi> Territories, thereby to hinder the Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the <hi>Welsh-men,</hi> called to this day in the <hi>Welsh</hi> Tongue <hi>Claudh Offa, (i.e.) Offa's Dike.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But from the Grant of the above-mention'd Pension, some Men of different Perswasions have drawn as different Consequences. <hi>Pol. Virgil,</hi> and divers of the <hi>Romish</hi> Writers, have from thence concluded, That King <hi>Offa,</hi> by this Act, made his Kingdom Tributary to the Pope; whereas indeed it was no such Thing, for it had been also granted by King <hi>Ina</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, (as hath been already observed,) for the Kingdom of the <hi>West Saxons</hi>; whose Example King <hi>Offa</hi> seemed now to follow, and indeed was no more than a Voluntary Annual Alms, or Benevolence, as it is expresly called in our <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals, as shall be shewn further here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>This is also urged by some high Promoters of the Royal Prerogative, to prove this King's unlimited Power in Ecclesiastical, as well as Civil Matters; since He (as they suppose) could, without the Consent of the Great Council of the Kingdom, charge all the Houses in his Dominions to pay, each of them, one Penny to the Pope: But this, if it be closely looked into, will prove a Mistake; for thô it be true, that upon King <hi>Offa</hi>'s going to <hi>Rome,</hi> he is said to have granted this Alms, called <hi>Rome</hi>'s <hi>Scot,</hi> or <hi>Peter-pence,</hi> to the Pope, yet <hi>Anno</hi> 794, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon his Return, you will find in Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi>'s Councils, he called a Great Council at <hi>Verulam,</hi> (now St. <hi>Alban</hi>'s,) where this Tribute might be confirmed by the Consent of the Estates of his Kingdom: Nor is the Silence of our Histories, or of the Acts of this Council it self, any material Argument to the contrary, since that Law might be lost, or omitted, by which it was confirmed, as well as several other Councils of that Age; there being no more mention made of this King's Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Lands given to this Monastery in the great Council at <hi>Verulam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 314.</note> than what is cited in Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi>'s Councils out of a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script History of St. <hi>Alban</hi>'s, all the Acts of that Council being now lost. But to return to our Annals.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The same Year <hi>Ethelred,</hi> (who had been twice King of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,)</hi> was slain by his own People 13<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                  <hi>Kal. Maii,</hi> and that deservedly, (as <hi>R. Hoveden</hi> relates,) as having been the Death of King <hi>Osred,</hi> his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour.</q> After <hi>Ethelred,</hi> one <hi>Osbald,</hi> a Nobleman, was made King; but held the Throne but a small time, being deserted by his Subjects, and at last forced to flee the Kingdom, going by Sea from <hi>Lindisfarne,</hi> and then taking Refuge with the King of the <hi>Picts,</hi> there died an Abbot. Who was most in fault, in all these frequent Rebellions, and Changes of Kings among the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> is hard to decide; since all the Annals, as well as Historians, are very short in their Relations of these Transactions; but it is certain, that the People, as well as Princes, must have suffered
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:93814:195"/>
much by such frequent Revolutions.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCXCIV.</note> And it is also very well observed by <hi>H. Huntington,</hi> that these frequent Rebellions, and Expulsion of their Kings, proceeded in great part from the proud and turbulent Temper of the <hi>Northumbrian Angles.</hi>

            <p>The same Year, (according to our Annals,) Bishop <hi>Ceolwulf,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Eadbald,</hi> departed from the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> and <hi>Egferth</hi> (Son to <hi>Offa)</hi> began his Reign over the <hi>Mercians,</hi> and within a few Months after deceased, having scarce reigned half a Year. It is also further to be noted, That this Prince, being of great Hopes and Worth, had been crowned King 9 Years before, in his Father's Life-time, and after his Death restored to the Church whatever he had violently seized on; but before he died, he left the Crown to <hi>Kenwulf,</hi> the next of the Royal Line.</p>
            <p>But the Monks do ascribe the short Reign of this good Prince, to his Father's Sins; but of these Things, it belongs not to us to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Also this Year <hi>Eadbert,</hi> or <hi>Ethelbert</hi> (Sirnamed <hi>Praen,)</hi> began to Reign in <hi>Kent,</hi> and also <hi>Ethelred</hi> the Ealderman deceased.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This Man had been a famous Commander in his time, but was then a Monk in the City of <hi>York</hi>; and now also, (according to the Annals,) the Heathen <hi>Danes</hi> destroyed <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and robbed the Monastery built by <hi>Egbert,</hi> which is at the Mouth of the River <hi>Weri</hi>; but there one of the <hi>Danish</hi> Captains was slain, and divers of their Ships de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed by a Tempest, and many of their Men drowned; but some of them reaching the Shore, were presently slain at the Mouth of the same River.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> imputes this to a Judgment inflicted on them by St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> for thus spoiling his Monastery.</p>

            <p>This <hi>Eardwulf,</hi> as <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> informs us, was he, who 5 Years before had so strangely escaped Death at <hi>Ripun,</hi> after he had been carried out to be buried; but the Chronicle of <hi>Mailross</hi> does here give great Light of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals; for it tells us, that now the <hi>Northumbers</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered their King <hi>Ethelred,</hi> the Son of <hi>Moll; Simeon</hi> places it a Year after, but says, The Murther was committed on the 14th of the <hi>Kalends</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> at a Place called <hi>Cobene</hi>; but they both agree, that immediately after his Death, one <hi>Osbald,</hi> a Nobleman of that Country, was made King, but reigned only 27 Days; and that then being forsaken by the Chief Men of his Kingdom, he was driven into the Isle of <hi>Lindisfarne</hi> with a few Followers, from whence he fled by Sea to the King of the <hi>Picts,</hi> where he became a Monk: And this <hi>Eardwulf</hi> reigned of his stead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> further adds, that <hi>Alcuin,</hi> writing to King <hi>Offa,</hi> tells him, That King <hi>Charles,</hi> so soon as he heard of this Murther of King <hi>Ethelred</hi> above-mentioned, and of the Perfidiousness of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumbrian</hi> Nation, not only stopt the Gifts he was then sending, but falling into a Passion against them, called them <hi>a perverse and perfidious Nation, and worse than Pagans</hi>; so that if <hi>Alcuin</hi> had not interceded for them, he would have done them all the Mischief he could.</p>

            <p>
               <q>The same Year is very remarkable, because (as our Annals relate,) <hi>Charles</hi> the Great was first made Emperour, and saluted <hi>Augustus</hi> by the <hi>Romans</hi>; he then condemned those to Death who had before outraged Pope <hi>Leo</hi>; but by the Pope's Intercession they were pardoned as to Life, and only banished; but Pope <hi>Leo</hi> himself anointed him Emperour.</q> Also this Year, according to the <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. Powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Also about this time, according to Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi>'s First Volume of Councils, was held the Third Council of <hi>Cloveshoe,</hi> under <hi>Kenwulf,</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> and <hi>Athelherd,</hi> or <hi>Ethelhard,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with all the Bishops, Ealderman, Abbots, and other Dignified Persons of that Province; in which few Things were transacted concerning the Faith, only the Lands of a certain Monastery, called <hi>Cotham,</hi> which had been given by <hi>Ethelbald,</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> to the Monastery of St. <hi>Saviours</hi>'s in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and had been upon the Embezeling the Deeds, unjustly taken away by King <hi>Kenwulph,</hi> but he now repenting of it, desired they should be restored; whereupon <hi>Cynedrith,</hi> his Daughter, then Abbess of that Monastery, gave the said Arch-Bishop other Lands in <hi>Kent</hi> there mentioned, in exchange for the same.</p>
            <p>But since I am come to the Conclusion of this Period, I cannot omit giving you a fuller Account of the Character, and Death of <hi>Brithric</hi> King of the <hi>West Saxons,</hi> and of the Succession of <hi>Egbert,</hi> who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards became the Chief or Supreme King of this Kingdom, and to whom all those Kings that remained were forced to become Tributary.</p>
            <p>As for King <hi>Britric,</hi> he is noted by <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> to have been more desirous of Peace, than War; and to that end, courted the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Foreign Princes, to have been easie to his Subjects in such Things as did not weaken his Government; yet being jealous of Prince <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> who afterwards succeeded him, he forced him to flee to King <hi>Offa</hi> for Refuge; but upon the coming of certain Ambassadours to Treat of a Marriage between King <hi>Brithric,</hi> and the Daughter of King <hi>Offa,</hi> he retired into <hi>France,</hi> till that King was made away by the means of his Wife <hi>Aeadburga,</hi> the Daughter of King <hi>Offa</hi>; who having prepared a Cup of poisoned Wine for one of his Favourites whom she hated, the King, coming in by chance, tasted of it, and so pined away. After whose Death, <hi>Asser,</hi> in his Annals, relates, That when this Queen could live no longer among the <hi>English,</hi> (being so hated by them for her violent and wicked Actions,) she went into <hi>France,</hi> where she was kindly Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and there making that Emperour many great Presents, for which he bidding her chuse whom she would have for a Husband, himself, or his Son, she foolishly chose his Son; whereupon the Emperour laughing, said <hi>If thou hadst chosen me, thou shouldest have had my Son, but now thou shalt have neither</hi>: (A just Return for her desiring to marry one so much younger than her self.) So the Emperour put her into a Monastery, where she lived for some Years as an Abbess; but being Expelled thence for her Incontinency, she wandred about with only one Servant, and begged her Bread in <hi>Pavia</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> till she died.</p>
            <p>But as for <hi>Egbert</hi> above mentioned, when he had been for about three Years banished into <hi>France,</hi> where (as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> tells us) he polished the Roughness of his own Country Manners, the <hi>French</hi> Nation being at that time the most Civilized of any of those <hi>Gothic</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Nations, who had some Ages before (as hath been already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated) settled themselves in this side of <hi>Europe:</hi> But upon the Death
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:93814:197"/>
of King <hi>Brihtric,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCC.</note> without any Issue, (as the same Author relates,) he was recalled by the Nobility of the <hi>West Saxon</hi> Kingdom; and being there ordained King, reigned with great Glory and Honour, exceeding all the <hi>English Saxon</hi> Kings that went before him, as shall be declared in the ensuing Book.</p>
            <p>But before I conclude this, I cannot forbear mentioning a Learned <hi>English-man,</hi> who flourished about this time, called <hi>Alcuinus,</hi> or <hi>Albinus</hi>; who, going into <hi>France,</hi> was in great Favour with <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, whom he taught the Liberal Arts, and by his means erected the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of <hi>Paris,</hi> where he read <hi>Logic, Rhetoric,</hi> and <hi>Astronomy</hi>; being the most Learned Man of all the <hi>English-men</hi> (if not of all others) in his Time. He died Abbot of St. <hi>Martins</hi> at <hi>Tours,</hi> which that King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon him. He wrote elegantly in Verse, as well as Prose, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the Age he lived in; as appears by his Poem <hi>De Pontificibus &amp; Sanctis Ecclesiae Eboracencis,</hi> lately Published by the Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>Gale,</hi> in his last Volume of <hi>English</hi> Historians.</p>
            <p>So having arrived to the end of this Period, I shall in the next Book shew, how King <hi>Egbert</hi> obtained not only the Crown of the <hi>West Saxon</hi> Kingdom, but also the Supreme Dominion of the <hi>English</hi> Nation.</p>

For though there had been before <hi>Egbert</hi> many chief or Principal Kings (several of whom <hi>Bede,</hi> as also the <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> have mentioned) who by the sole power of their Arms succeeded each other in that Title, yet did it never so

properly belong to any one as to King <hi>Egbert,</hi> (with whose Reign we shall begin this Book;) since he was not satisfied as others had been before him, with the bare acknowledgments and submissions of the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Kings; but having subdued most of them, he laid their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to his own, leaving only those of the <hi>Mercians, Northumbrians</hi> and <hi>East-Angl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But since the Invasion of the <hi>Danes,</hi> also happened in the beginning of this Period, 'tis fit we say something of it, both as to its Causes, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments by which it was performed; in the doing of which I shall make use of <hi>H.

Lastly, the <hi>Normans,</hi> who succeeded the <hi>Danes</hi> in subduing this Nation, yet granted not only Life and Liberty to the vanquished, but also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited them the use of their ancient Laws and Customs; whereas the <hi>Danes</hi> wasted and spoiled this whole Island, for a long time together by frequent Incursions, exempting no places Sacred or Prophane from Spoil or Ruin; so that sparing neither Age nor Sex, they seemed for a long time not so much to design the Conquest, as Destruction of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If therefore you do but consider the frequent Invasions of that Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous People, how they often landed in several places at once, thereby not only dividing the Forces of the <hi>English-Saxons,</hi> but also so distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Commanders, that they could not tell which way to March a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; you may hence observe (that next to the Providence, and Mercy of God,) nothing but the extraordinary Valour and Conduct of those Kings, whose Great and Noble Actions we shall here relate, could have preserved this Nation from being totally subdued long before; nor could they ever bring it under their Power, till they met with a Prince, who fell very short of his Ancestors, as well in Prudence and Valour, as (in the chiefest thing of all) the love of his Subjects.</p>

                  <hi>Anno. Dom.</hi> DCCCII.</note> which provoked the wrath of God to bring this dreadful Judgment upon the <hi>English</hi> Nation, the same Author gives us this probable Account, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That in the Primitive Church of <hi>England,</hi> Religion shined with so great a Lustre, that divers Kings and Queens, together with many of the great Men and Bishops undertook Monastick Vows, (as you have already heard;) but in process of time all Virtue and Piety so far declined, that the <hi>English Saxons</hi> suffered no Nation to exceed them in deceit, and all manner of wickedness; which chiefly appears in the precedent, as well as following History of the <hi>Northumbrian</hi> Kings, in which you will find, that all Orders and Degrees of Men were guilty of so great Treachery and Rebellion, that nothing was a greater disgrace than Piety and Innocence, which was looked upon as a just occasion to be made away; wherefore it was no wonder, if God thought fit to send upon them whole swarms of cruel Nations, which destroyed all before them, (to wit) the <hi>Danes</hi> or <hi>Norwegians,</hi> together with the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Vandals.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>These from the latter end of the Reign of King <hi>Egbert,</hi> to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Reign of <hi>William</hi> the First, being above Two Hundred and Thirty Years, never gave this Island any long respite from their Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. So that it seems it was not the Nation of the <hi>Danes</hi> alone, (properly so called,) who were the cause of this Destruction, but a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of divers of these Northern Nations, who joyning together, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed at first to themselves no other design but Plunder and Spoil: But of this we shall speak more in due time; and shall now proceed in our History, where we left off in our last Book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Egbert,</hi> the only surviving Prince of the Blood-Royal of the <hi>West Saxon</hi> Kings, as great Nephew to Ina, by his Brother <hi>Inegilds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno. Dom.</hi> DCCCII.</note> being arrived in <hi>England,</hi> was now ordained King, as <hi>Ethelwerd</hi> expressly terms his Election.</p>
            <p>But since <hi>Asser</hi> in his Annals, places this King's coming to the Crown under <hi>Anno</hi> 802. as does <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> and also, <hi>Roger Howden,</hi> from an Ancient piece of <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronologie, inserted at the beginning of the first Book of his first part; and this account being also proved by that great Master in Chronology, the now Lord Bishop of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> to be truer then that of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals, or <hi>Ethelwerd,</hi> by divers Proofs, too long to be here Inserted. I have made bold to put this King's coming to the Crown, two Years backwarder then it is in the last Book, thô I confess the former Account in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals, would have made a more exact Epocha.</p>
            <p>Also about this time, as appears from the ancient Register of St. <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>'s Abbey in <hi>York</hi>; cited in <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Vol. P.</hi> 367.</note> 
               <hi>Monast.

            </p>
            <p>Now, thô by the word Parliament here used, it is certain that this Register was writ long after the Conquest; yet it might be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed from some more ancient Monument, since <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> tells us of this King, (tho' without setting down the time,) that by the greatness of his Mind, he reduced all the Varieties of the <hi>English Saxon</hi> Kingdoms to one uniform Empire, or Dominion, which he called <hi>England</hi>; though others perhaps more truly refer it towards the latter end of his Reign, as you will find when we come to it.</p>

               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:93814:201"/>This Year <hi>Eardulf,</hi> King of the <hi>Northumbers</hi> led his Army against <hi>Kenwulf,</hi> King of <hi>Mercia,</hi> for harbouring his Enemies, who also gathering together a great Army, they approached to each other; when by the Advice of the Bishops and Noblemen of <hi>England,</hi> as also by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the chief King of the <hi>English,</hi> (by whom is meant King <hi>Egbert</hi>; who then passed under that Title.)

            <p>During these Confusions in the <hi>Northumbrian</hi> Kingdom, Arch-Bishop <hi>Usher</hi> with great probability supposes (in his <hi>Antiquitat. Britan.

            <p>But it is wholly incredible what <hi>Buchanan,</hi> in his <hi>Scotish</hi> History, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in the Year following, to wit, That <hi>Achaius,</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> having reigned 32 Years, and had formerly aided (but in what Year of his Reign he tells us not) <hi>Hungus,</hi> King of the <hi>Picts,</hi> with 10000 <hi>Scots</hi> against one <hi>Athelstan,</hi> then wasting the <hi>Pictish</hi> Borders; and that <hi>Hungus,</hi> by the Aid of those <hi>Scots,</hi> and the Help of St. <hi>Andrew</hi> their Patron, in a Vision by Night, and the Appearance of a Cross by Day, routed the astonished <hi>English,</hi> and slew this <hi>Athelstan</hi> in Fight. But who this <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan</hi> was, I believe no Man knows; <hi>Buchanan</hi> supposes him to have been some <hi>Danish</hi> Commander, on whom King <hi>Alured,</hi> or <hi>Alfred,</hi> had bestowed <hi>Northumberland</hi>: Yet of this, I find no Foot-steps in our ancient Writers; and if any such Thing were done in the time of <hi>Alfred,</hi> it must be above 60 Years after, for King <hi>Alfred</hi> began not to Reign till <hi>Anno</hi> 871. And <hi>John Fordun,</hi> in his <hi>Scotish</hi> History, is also as much mistaken, making this <hi>Athelstan</hi> to be the Son of King <hi>Ethelwulf,</hi> who then governed the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Provinces under his Father, which also fails almost as much in point of time; this Prince <hi>Athelstan</hi> here mentioned being (as appears by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals) alive, and engaged in a Sea-Fight against the <hi>Danes</hi> above 40 Years after, as you will find in its due place set down. This <hi>Athelstan</hi> therefore, and this great Overthrow, seems rather to have been a meer Fancy of some idle Monk.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCXI.</note>And this Year, (according to <hi>Mat. Westminster,)</hi> as King <hi>Egbert</hi> had the Year before subdued the <hi>Welsh-men,</hi> so (it seems upon some fresh Rebellion of theirs) he again entred their Borders, and laid them waste from North to South with Fire and Sword, and then returned home Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding the Wars the <hi>Welsh</hi> had from abroad, it seems they had also time enough for Civil Wars at home; for now (according to <hi>Caradoc</hi>'s Chronicle) <hi>Conan,</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Howel,</hi> could not agree, insomuch that they tried the Matter by Battle, where <hi>Howel</hi> had the Victory; to which Dr.<hi>Powel</hi> hath here added this Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>That this <hi>Howel,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Conan,</hi> King or Prince of <hi>North Wales,</hi> did claim the Isle of <hi>Mon,</hi> or <hi>Anglesey,</hi> for part of his Father's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, which <hi>Conan</hi> refusing to give him, thereupon they fell at Variance, and consequently made War the one against the other.</p>
            <p>And here (says he) I think fit to say somewhat of the old Custom and Tenure of <hi>Wales,</hi> from whence this Mischief grew, that is, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of the Father's Inheritance amongst all the Sons commonly called <hi>Gauel kind. Gauel</hi> is a <hi>British</hi> Term, signifying a <hi>Hold,</hi> because every one of the Sons did hold some portion of his Father's Lands, as his lawful Son and Successour. This was the Cause, not only of the Overthrow of all the ancient Nobility of <hi>Wales,</hi> (for by that means the Inheritance being continually divided and subdivided amongst the Children, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's Children, it was at length brought to nothing,) but also of much Bloodshed, unnatural Strife, and Contention amongst Brethren; as we have here an Example, and many others in this History. This kind of Partition is very good to plant and settle a Nation in a large Country, not inhabited, but in a populous Country already furnished with Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants;
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:93814:202"/>
it is the utter Decay of great Families, and (as I said before) the cause of constant Strife and Debate But some Years after, <hi>Howel</hi> gave his Brother <hi>Conan</hi> another Defeat, and slew a great many of his People.</p>
            <p>Whereupon <hi>Conan</hi> levied an Army in the Year 817, and chased his Brother <hi>Howel</hi> out of the Isle of <hi>Anglesey,</hi> compelling him to flee into that of <hi>Man</hi>; and a little after died <hi>Conan,</hi> chief King of the <hi>Britains,</hi> or <hi>Welsh-men,</hi> leaving behind him a Daughter named <hi>Esylht,</hi> who was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a Nobleman, called <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Westminster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This young Prince was committed by his Sister to an Attendant, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be made away; who carrying him into a Wood under pretence of Hunting; cut off his Head, and threw his Body into a Thicket of Bushes; his Sister presently seizing the Kingdom, straitly forbad all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry to be made after her lost Brother: But sure it was Miraculous, That a thing done so privately in <hi>England,</hi> should be first known at <hi>Rome:</hi> but so it came to pass by Divine Revelation; for upon the Altar of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> a White Dove let fall a certain Paper, which discovered both the Death of King <hi>Kenelm,</hi> and also the place of his Burial; which being Written in Golden Letters was thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Clent Cow-batch,</hi> Kenelme <hi>King Bearne, lieth under a Thorne, heaved bereaved.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>But it seems the Characters were so hard to be read, that all the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Clerks there present, attempted in vain at the Pope's Command to read this writing; but an <hi>English</hi> Man by chance standing by, (whom, to make the Miracle the greater, <hi>Mat.

            <p>But now my hand is in, pray take all the rest of the Story.</p>
            <p>When the Body of this Young Prince was brought home, the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress his Sister, being vexed with the Singing of those Clerks and Laicks that attended the Corps, and looking out of her Chamber Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in pure Spite, repeated the Psalm backward which they then Sung, thereby to disturb the Harmony of the Chorus; but (as the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour adds,) whilest she was thus singing, both her Eyes fell out of her Head upon the Psalter she held in her Hands, and the Psalter it self set in Silver, and besmeared with the Blood of her Eyes, (being then to be seen) gave a pregnant Testimony of her Crime, as well as punishment; yet it seems <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> knew nothing of this Legend of the finding the Body, but only says, it was discovered by Miraculous Rays of a vast Light, which shining all Night over the place where it lay, was the occasion of its being found out; but no matter for the manner, both of them being alike credible. This is enough, (if not too much) of this Boy, King and Martyr: And this is certain, that his unnatural Sister did not enjoy the Fruits of her wicked Ambition long;<note place="margin">

            <p>From which passage in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals it is apparent, that this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Dominion of one <hi>English</hi> King over all the rest was no new thing, <hi>Bede</hi> having taken notice of it long before; yet did they not therefore take upon them the Title of Monarchs, any more than <hi>Egbert,</hi> who now succeeded them in that Power, thô most of our Historians, who have written the <hi>Saxon</hi> History in <hi>English,</hi> have (but without any just reason) given them that Title, which could not properly belong to Kings, who had divers others under them, with the like Regal Jurisdiction within their own Territories; not but that King <hi>Egbert</hi> was in a more peculiar manner the Supream King of <hi>England,</hi> because by his Absolute Conquest of the Kingdoms of <hi>Kent,</hi> and of the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>East Saxons,</hi> he was the greatest King who had hitherto Reigned in <hi>England</hi>; all the rest of the Kings that remained, Reigning by his permission, and paying him Tribute; a power which never had been exercised by any other King before him.</p>
            <p>But to return to our History; it seems that King <hi>Egbert</hi> was so highly displeased with the <hi>Mercians</hi> for setting up a King without his consent, that <hi>Ingulf</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> tell us, That as soon as ever <hi>Withlaf</hi> was made King, before he could raise an Army, he was expell'd his Kingdom, which <hi>Egbert</hi> added to his own; but <hi>Withlaf</hi> being search'd for by <hi>Egbert</hi>'s Commanders through all <hi>Mercia,</hi> he was by the industry of <hi>Seward</hi> Abbot of <hi>Croyland,</hi> concealed in the Cell of the Holy Virgin <hi>Etheldrith,</hi> Daughter of King <hi>Offa,</hi> and once the Spouse of <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> King of the <hi>East Angles</hi>; where King <hi>Withlaf</hi> found a safe retreat for the space of Four Months; until such time as by the Mediation of said Abbot <hi>Seward,</hi> he was reconciled to King <hi>Egbert</hi>; and upon promise of the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an Yearly Tribute, permitted to return to his Kingdom in Peace; which is by him acknowledged in that Charter of his, that <hi>Ingulf</hi> hath given us of his <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the Lands and priviledges of the Abbey of <hi>Croyland.</hi> 
               <q>It was made in the Great Council of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the presence of his Lords, Egbert <hi>King of</hi> West-Saxony, <hi>and his Son</hi> Ethelwulf, <hi>and before the Bishops and great Men of all</hi> England, <hi>Assembled at the City of</hi> London, <hi>to take Counsel against the</hi> Dani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This Restoration of King <hi>Withlaf</hi> to his Kingdom is also mentioned in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals of the next Year, where it is said</p>

            <p>Now likewise, as <hi>Mat. Westminster</hi> relates, King <hi>Egbert</hi> vanquished <hi>Swithred,</hi> King of the <hi>East-Saxons,</hi> and drove him out of his Kingdom; upon whose expulsion, the <hi>West Saxon</hi> Kings ever after possest that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Now (according to the same Authour) King <hi>Egbert</hi> having subdued all the <hi>South</hi> Parts of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

            <p>To this Year I think we may also refer that great Transaction, which the Annals of the Cathedral Church of <hi>Winchester</hi> (printed in <note n="*" place="margin">1. <hi>Vol. P.</hi> 32.</note>

            <p>
               <q>In like manner the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Sweones,</hi> with those whom we call <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> do possess the <hi>Northern</hi> Shore of <hi>Scandinavia,</hi> together with all the Islands adjoyning to it, whil'st the <hi>Sclavi</hi> with divers other Nations inhabit the <hi>Southern</hi> Coasts; but the <hi>Norwegans,</hi> or rather <hi>Northern</hi> Men, (for so they are called by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> because they lye more <hi>Northerly</hi> than the greater part of that Nation,) and indeed all those that inhabit <hi>Scanzia,</hi> are (by those People of <hi>Europe,</hi> that lye more remote,) with very good reason called in the <hi>German</hi> Tongue (<hi>i.e.</hi>) Northland Men.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Next to <hi>Eginhart, Adam</hi> of <hi>Bremen,</hi> (who lived about Two Hundred Years after) does not only insert these very words of the aforesaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but also adds this further, that the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Swedes</hi> with the other Nations, beyond the River <hi>Danabius,</hi> are by the <hi>French</hi> Historians all called <hi>Normans</hi>; so likewise <hi>Albertus,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Stade,</hi> who wrote about the Year 1250, says likewise, that the <hi>Danes</hi> and other Nations, who lived beyond <hi>Denmark,</hi> are all called <hi>Normans</hi>; from which Authorities the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Grotius</hi> in his <hi>Prolegomena</hi> to his <hi>Gothic</hi> History, lays it down as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Truth, that whatever we find among any writers of that Age concerning the <hi>Normans,</hi> does rightly belong to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who were then one of the greatest and most powerful of those <hi>Northern</hi> Nations, that were all then called by one general Name of <hi>Normans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as for their Religion, I need say no more of it, since I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told you in the beginning of the Third Book, that all those Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had the same common Deities, (<hi>viz.) Woden,</hi> and <hi>Thor, &amp;c.</hi> whose Names I have there already set down, to which last Deities, as <hi>Ubbo Emmius</hi> relates, they before any great exepedition, sacrificed a Captive, by knocking out his Brains, and smearing their Faces in his Blood, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately marched against their Enemies; but that they were extreamly given to Witchcraft and Inchantments, all their own Authours relate, which would be too tedious here to repeat, since you will meer with some Instances of it in the following History.

               <q>This Year is very remarkable, for King <hi>Egbert</hi> encountred Thirty Five Ships of <hi>Danish</hi> Pyrates at <hi>Carrum</hi> (now called <hi>Charmouth</hi> in <hi>Dorset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>) where there was a great slaughter, but the <hi>Danes</hi> kept the Field,] whereby we may guess that they had the advantage; yet it seems before this time, (even in this very Year) the <hi>Danes</hi> had been vanquished, and put to flight at <hi>Dunmouth,</hi> (now called <hi>Tinmouth,</hi> from whence (having now spoiled the Isle of <hi>Sheppey</hi>) they Sail'd to <hi>Charmouth</hi> above-mentioned.</q>

            <p>This shews us (as <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> well observes) the Instability of all Worldly grandeur; for now King <hi>Egbert</hi> being arrived at the height of Empire, met with this unlooked for Enemy, who harrassed him and his Posterity for divers Generations: And thô in this Sea Fight last mentioned, he had the better for the greater part of the Day, yet towards Night he lost the Victory, thô by the help of it he retreated, and so saved the disgrace of an entire defeat; this was the only time that Fortune ceased to favour King <hi>Egbert</hi>'s Undertakings.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This King as the same Authour relates, governed his Subjects with great Clemency, and was as terrible to his Enemies, and for Nine Years Reigned Supream King over all <hi>Britain:</hi> Before his Death he is said (by <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi>) to have told his Son <hi>Ethelwulf,</hi> whom he left his Successour, <q>That he might be happy if he did not permit the Kingdom, which he had now laid together with great Industry, to be spoiled by sloathfulness, to which this Nation had been too much addicted.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There is little mention of this King's Children, except <hi>Ethelwulf,</hi> only it is said by <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Tinmouth,</hi> that he had also a Daughter called <hi>Edgithe,</hi> who being first bred up under an <hi>Irish</hi> Abbess, called <hi>Modwina,</hi> was made Abbess of the Nunnery at <hi>Polesworth</hi>; but this, since we have no better Authority than modern hands for it, I cannot be certain of; but as for the Wife of King <hi>Egbert</hi> who was (according to the late <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Law,) never called Queen, her Name was <hi>Redburge,</hi> and she is mentioned, by <hi>John Beaver</hi> to have procured that Law from her Husband, that no <hi>Welshman</hi> should without leave pass over <hi>Offa</hi>'s Ditch upon pain of Death.</p>

               <p>This Prince (as <hi>Thomas Rudborn</hi> in his History of the Church of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> relates) had been during the Life of his Elder Brother (whose Name we know not) educated in the Monastery of <hi>Winchester,</hi> under the Tuition of <hi>Helmestan</hi> Bishop, and <hi>Swithune, Praepositus,</hi> or Dean of that Church, and had there taken the Order of a Subdeacon, with an intent (as is supposed) to have professed himself a Monk, not that he was ever made Bishop of that Church, thô it is so related by <hi>H. Huntington</hi> and other Writers.</p>
               <p>But King <hi>Egbert</hi> having no other Son living, he was dispenced with to Marry; and returning very early to a Secular Life, helped his Father in his Wars; after whose Death he was advanced to the Throne, yet he always retained a great deal of the Monk, loved his ease, and had very little Ambition; and therefore not caring to trouble himself with the Governing of many Provinces, he rested contented with his Paternal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>West Saxony,</hi> and made over the Kingdoms of <hi>Kent,</hi> and of the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>East Saxons</hi> (being his Father's Conquests) to <hi>Athelstan,</hi> his Son (as the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals and <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> expresly call him,) and which is more, <hi>Ethelwerd</hi> in his Chronicle gives us the Names of Five Sons of King <hi>Ethelwu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Westminster</hi> says, That he was his base Son, which is most probable, since he had not any Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Son then old enough to Govern a Kingdom as this <hi>Athelstan</hi> at that time was, and whom we shall often find mentioned in this History; thô when, or how he dyed, all our Writers are silent.</p>

               <p>But thô the <hi>Scotish</hi> Historians do justly date the Empire of their Kings over all <hi>Scotland,</hi> from this Total Conquest of the <hi>Picts</hi> by King <hi>Kened</hi>; according to that old Verse:</p>

               <p>This Prince, Commonly called <hi>Rodoric</hi> the Great, began his Reign over <hi>Wales</hi> this Year; it was he who divided all <hi>Wales</hi> into three Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of <hi>Aberfraw, Dineuawr,</hi> and <hi>Mathraval,</hi> he had great Wars with <hi>Burhred,</hi> King of <hi>Mercia,</hi> who by the aid of King <hi>Ethelulph</hi> entred <hi>North Wales</hi> with a great Power, and destroyed <hi>Anglesey,</hi> and fought with the <hi>Welshmen</hi> of <hi>Northwales</hi> divers times, and slew <hi>Meyric,</hi> a great Prince among them.</p>
               <p>This Year, (according to <hi>Mat. Westminster) Aethelred</hi> King of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> was driven from his <hi>Kingdom,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The same Year also (according to sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi>'s 1. Vol. of Councils) was held the Council of <hi>Kingsbury</hi> under <hi>Berthwulf,</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians, Ceolnoth,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> with the other Bishops and Wise Men of the Province being present, wherein, besides the publick business of the Kingdom, several grievances of the Monks were redressed, and the Charter of that King to the Abby of <hi>Croyland</hi> is confirmed under the Rule of St. <hi>Benedict,</hi> and is supposed by Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi> in his Councils to be a great Council of that Kingdom; because it bears date in the Week of <hi>Easter,</hi> when they were Assembled about the publick Affairs of the Kingdom, at which time as also at <hi>Whitsontide</hi> and <hi>Christmass,</hi> the great Men of the Kingdom were wont of course to attend at the King's Court, to consult, and ordain, what should be necessary for the common Good, when also the King used to appear in State with his Crown upon his head; which custom of holding great Councils, was also continued after the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest, to the middle of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, as Sir <hi>H.

               <p>I have inserted this, to let you see the form of Leasing out the Abbey Lands in those Days, and which it seems required the Solemnity of the Common Council of that Kingdom to confirm it.</p>
               <p>The same Year also, (according to <hi>Florence) Berthulph</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians</hi> deceased, and <hi>Burhed</hi> succeeded him,</p>

               <p>
                  <q>This Year also, King <hi>Aethelwulf</hi> sent his Son <hi>Aelfred</hi> to Pope <hi>Leo</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> who there anointed him King, and adopted him for his Episcopal Son.</q> It is much disputed among some of our Modern Historians, of what the Pope anointed <hi>Alfred</hi> King, whether of any present, or else future Dominions; But since, an ancient Manuscript in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library (containing an History of the Kings of <hi>England</hi>) says expresly, That he was anointed <hi>In Successorem Paterni Regni,</hi> and that we do not read of any Territories King <hi>Alfred</hi> enjoyed till after the Death of his Brethren; it is most reasonable to understand it in the plain Literal Sense, as it is here set down, not only in these Annals, but in <hi>Asser</hi>'s Account of this King's Life and Actions, that the Pope anointed him King as a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Presage of his future Royal Dignity.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And the same Year <hi>Ealcher</hi> with the <hi>Kentish-men,</hi> and <hi>Huda</hi> with the <hi>Surrey-men,</hi> fought with the <hi>Danish</hi> Army in the Isle of <hi>Thanet,</hi> and at first had the better of them, but there were many killed and drowned on both sides, and both the Ealdormen or Chief Commanders perished.</q>

               </p>
               <p>This being the famous and solemn Grant of King <hi>Aethelwulf</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Tythes, requires a more particular Relation, and therefore I shall here give you the Words of the said Grant at large. — <q>I <hi>Aethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wulf,</hi> King of the <hi>West Saxons,</hi> with the Councel (or Consent) of my Bishops and Chief Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have consented, That a certain Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Part of the Lands heretofore possess'd by all Orders and Degrees of Persons, whether Men or Women, Servants of GOD, (<hi>i. e.</hi> Monks or Nuns,) or meer Laicks, shall give their Tenth Mansion, and where it is least, the Tenth Part of all their Goods, free and discharged of all Secular Servitude, and particularly of all Royal Tributes or Taxations, as well the greater as the less, which they call <hi>Wittereden, (which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a certain Fine or Forfeiture;)</hi> and that they be free from all other
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:93814:209"/>
Things, as Expedition, building of a Bridge,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCLIV.</note> or fortifying of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that they may the more diligently pour out their Prayers to GOD for us without ceasing, we do in some part discharge their other Service. These Things were done in <hi>Winchester,</hi> in the Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the Year of our LORD's Incarnation 855, the Third Indiction, on the <hi>Nones</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> before the great Altar, in Honour of the Glorious Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Mother of GOD, St. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel, and St. <hi>Peter</hi> Prince of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, as also of our blessed Father Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> all the Arch-Bishops and Bishops of <hi>England</hi> being present, and subscribing to it; as also <hi>Beorhed</hi> King of <hi>Mercia,</hi> together with the Abbots, Abbesses, Earls, and other chief Men of the whole Kingdom, with an infinite mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of other Believers, who all of them have witnessed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the Royal Grant, but the Dignitaries have thereunto sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed their Names.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But, as <hi>Ingulph</hi> relates, King <hi>Aethelwulf,</hi> for the greater firmness thereof, offered this Charter at the Altar of St. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>; but that the Bishops received it in the Faith of God, and transmitted it to be published throughout all the Churches in their several Diocesses.</p>
               <p>Thô this Grant of Tithes is mentioned by the Annals, as to be made before the King's going to <hi>Rome,</hi> yet it appears by the Date, as also from <hi>Asser</hi> and <hi>Ingulph,</hi> not to have been done till after his Return from thence; which makes Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi> conjecture, (and not without good Grounds,) that this Grant was twice made; once before his going to <hi>Rome,</hi> it being there confirmed by the Pope, and was also regranted by a Great Council of the Kingdom after his Return, as appears by the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter here recited.</p>
               <p>I have been the more exact in reciting this Law concerning Tythes, both because it gives us the form of passing an Act in the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Kingdom at that time, and who were the Parties to it, as also because this was the first general Law that was ever made in a Mycel Synod of the whole Kingdom for the payment of Tythes, thô I do not deny but there had been before some particular Laws of King <hi>Ina</hi> and King <hi>Offa</hi> to the same effect; yet those could only oblige the <hi>West Saxon</hi> and <hi>Mercian</hi> Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>The next Year also (according to <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Asser</hi>'s Chronicle) K. <hi>Aethelwulf</hi> went to <hi>Rome,</hi> carrying <hi>Aelfred,</hi>

                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCLV.</note> his youngest and best beloved Son along with him, but to what intent, having been so lately there before, we know not, any more than what the King did there, unless to repair the <hi>English</hi> School or Colledge for Youth, that had been lately burnt; but it is certain, he stayed abroad near a Year, and in his Return home, <hi>Charles,</hi> (Sirnamed <hi>The Bald,</hi>) King of the <hi>Franks,</hi> gave him his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Wife, who was called <hi>Leotheta,</hi> (in French <hi>Judith,)</hi> and so, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with her, he returned into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as <hi>Asser</hi> relates, there was in the mean time an infamous Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy framed in the Western Parts of <hi>England,</hi> for Prince <hi>Aethelbald,</hi> the King's eldest Son, and <hi>Ealchstan</hi> Bishop of <hi>Scirborne,</hi> and <hi>Aeanwulf</hi> Earl of <hi>Somerset,</hi> had plotted together, that King <hi>Aethelwulf,</hi> at his Return Home, should never be received into his Kingdom; most Men laid this to the Charge of this Bishop and Earl only, thô many do chiefly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it to the Perverseness of this young Prince, who was also very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate in other Wickedness. So the King his Father returning from

               <p>All this Disturbance seems to have been raised by his Son and his Faction, because of his marrying this new Wife, whom notwithstanding having now brought over with him, he placed by him on the Royal Throne as long as he lived, without any Dispute or Opposition from his Nobles; thô (says this Author) the Nation of the <hi>West Saxons</hi> did not permit the Queen to sit by the King, or to be called <hi>Queen</hi>; which Custom our Ancestors relate to have proceeded from a certain wicked Queen, called <hi>Eadburga,</hi> the Wife of King <hi>Bryhtric,</hi> whose Story, <hi>Asser</hi> in his Annals, as also in his <hi>De Gestis Alfredi,</hi> hath given us at large, where speaking of the Occasion of this severe Law, he tells us, it proceeded from the wicked Carriage of that Queen, (already mentioned at the end of the former Book,) who abusing her Husband's Affections by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true Accusations, took away many Men's Lives; and being hated by the <hi>English</hi> after that King's Decease, they made that Law now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>

These Grants are supposed by Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> to have been made in a general Council of the whole Kingdom, but after this time we find no more of them for many Years, by reason of the frequent Invasions of the <hi>Danes.</hi> But not long after King <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wulf</hi> died, and was buried at <hi>Winchester,</hi> having reigned 20 Years and 5 Months; for the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals, which allow him but 18 Years and an half, are certainly mistaken.</p>
               <p>This Year also, (according to <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,) Humbert</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop anointed that Glorious Martyr, <hi>Edmund</hi> King of the <hi>East Angles,</hi> being then but 15 Years old, at a Town called <hi>Buram,</hi> being then the Royal Seat.</p>
               <p>But having no Account of King <hi>Edmund</hi>'s Pedigree, or of the Place of his Birth from any of our <hi>English</hi> Historians, you must be content with what <hi>Johannes Anglicus</hi> of <hi>Tinmouth</hi> hath told us, or in his Legend of Saints, (called <hi>Sanctilogium,</hi>) of this King and Martyr, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was the Son of one <hi>Alemond,</hi> a Nobleman of the Blood Royal of the <hi>East Angles,</hi> who having fled for fear of King <hi>Offa</hi> into <hi>Old Saxony,</hi> out of which his Family first came, had there by his Wife called <hi>Cywara</hi> a Son, whom he named <hi>Edmund,</hi> the pretended Miracles of whose Birth I purposely omit. This Prince having been instructed in all Christian and Moral Duties, lived in <hi>Germany</hi> to the 14th Year of his Age, and upon his return into <hi>England</hi> was so acceptable to the <hi>East Angles,</hi> that he was by them Elected <hi>King,</hi> and, till his Death, continued in the quiet Possession of that Kingdom, without any opposition of King <hi>Ethelwulf,</hi> or any of his Sons, then Kings of the <hi>West Saxons,</hi> to whose Dominions that Kingdom of the <hi>East Angles</hi> had lately been made subject; and hence it may be reasonably inferred, that it was by King <hi>Ethelwulf</hi>'s Consent, that <hi>Edmund</hi> being returned out of <hi>Germany,</hi> took Possession of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>Being thus made King, and, by reason of his tender Age, not esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself capable of managing the Affairs of the Nation, he willingly submitted them and himself to the Direction of the said Bishop of the <hi>East Angles,</hi> by whom he was Crowned, and by whose Councel and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection he behaved himself as became a Prince, endued with all Kingly Virtues; so that during his Reign, his principal Care was to repair the Ruines which the <hi>Mercian</hi> Arms and Tyranny had brought upon the Churches of the <hi>East Angles,</hi> reduced by War to extream Poverty, and consequently to a Neglect of Piety and Ecclesiastical Discipline. And thus he Reigned 14 Years in Peace, with the Affection of all his Subjects, till GOD was pleased, by sending the Pagan <hi>Danes</hi> as a Scourge to his Country, to render this Prince a high Example of Christian Fortitude and Constancy.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>This Year the <hi>Danish</hi> Army landed in <hi>Thanet,</hi> and wintering there, made a League with the <hi>Kentish-men,</hi> who promised them Money, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they would keep the Peace; under pretence of which, and of the Money promised, the <hi>Danes</hi> stole out of their Camp, and wasted all the East part of <hi>Kent.</hi>]</q> For, as <hi>Asser</hi> well observes, they knew they could get more by Plunder, than by Peace.</p>

For (says he) the <hi>Northumbers</hi> had now expelled <hi>Osbright,</hi> their lawful King, and had set up a Tyrant or Usurper, one <hi>Aella,</hi> who was not descended of the Royal Line; but now when the <hi>Pagans</hi> invaded them by the Intercession of the great Men, and for the Common Safety, the two Kings joyned their Forces, and so marched to <hi>York</hi>; at whose coming the <hi>Danes</hi> presently fled, and endeavoured to defend themselves within the City; which the Christians perceiving, resolved to follow them to the very Walls, and breaking in, and entering the Town with them; (for it seems, that City had not in those Times such strong Walls, as they had when <hi>Asser</hi> wrote his History;) therefore when the Christians had made a Breach in the Wall as they designed, and that a great part of them had entred the City, the <hi>Pagans</hi> being compelled by Necessity and Despair, broke out upon them, and killed, routed, and put to flight the whole Army, as well within as without the Town; so that both the Kings were slain, together with many Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and a vast number of Common Souldiers; and a great many were

taken Prisoners,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCLXVII.</note> and those that remained alive were forced to make Peace with the <hi>Danes,</hi> who (according to the Chronicle of <hi>Mailross,</hi>) made one <hi>Egbert</hi> King over the <hi>Northumbers</hi> that were left, thô under the <hi>Danish</hi> Dominion; but it seems, it was over those that lay on the North side of the River <hi>Time,</hi> as <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Darham,</hi> in his History of that Church, relates.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The same Year also died <hi>Aethstan</hi> the Bishop, after he had held his See of <hi>Scireborne</hi> 50 Years, whose Body was buried in that Town.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But since the Chronicle that goes under the Name of Abbot <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. X. <hi>Script. Col.</hi> 802.</note> 
                  <hi>Brom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> undertakes to give some probable Account how the <hi>Danes</hi> came to invade the Kingdom of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> thô it looks somewhat like a Romance, yet I shall here give it you, since it is found in no other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor that I know of, being thus. <hi>Osbriht,</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> going one day a hunting, as he returned home went privately to the House of one of his Noblemen, called <hi>Bruern Brocard,</hi> to refresh himself; <hi>Bruern</hi> knowing nothing of the King's coming, was gone to the Sea side, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Custom, to secure the Shoar against Pirats; but his Wife, a Woman of great Beauty, entertained the King at Dinner very splendidly. The King have dined, took her by the Hand and led her to her Chamber, telling her, He must speak with her in private; and there removing all out of the way; but such as were privy to his Secrets, he by Force and Violence lay with her. Having thus had his Will, he speedily returned to <hi>York,</hi> whilst she so lamented, and wept, that her Face was extremely altered; which caused her Husband at his return to ask the cause of so sudden a Change, and such an unusual Sadness: Whereupon she told him the whole Matter, how the King had forced her; which having heard, he comforted her, bidding her not to afflict her self, since she was not able to resist a Man so potent; assuring her, because she had told him the Truth, he would not love her less than he had done before; and if GOD gave him leave, he would Revenge both himself, and her, upon him that had committed the Crime. Then did <hi>Bruern,</hi> being a Man both Noble and Powerful, call his Kindred together, to whom he revealed the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front put upon him, and his Intention speedily to Revenge it; To which they all consenting, and approving his Purpose, he with them took Horse and rode to <hi>York.</hi> The King, upon sight of him, called him to him very civilly, but he having all his Relations at his Back, defied him, renouncing his Allegiance, giving up his Land, and whatsoever else he held of him. This said, without any more Words he withdrew, making no stay at all at Court.</p>
               <p>So his Friends consenting, he went straitways over to <hi>Denmark,</hi> where he made a great Complaint to the King of the Affront offered to him and his Wife by K. <hi>Osbriht,</hi> desiring his speedy Relief and Supplies to put him into a Capacity to revenge himself. At this News, <hi>Godrin</hi> and his <hi>Danes</hi> conceived very great Joy, having now some Reason to induce them to invade the <hi>English,</hi> and revenge the Injury offered to <hi>Bruern,</hi> who was descended of his Blood; whereupon he speedily prepared a great Army, over which he made Captains, two Brothers, called <hi>Inguar,</hi> and <hi>Hubba,</hi> most valiant Souldiers; and to them he gave a Navy, furnished with all Necessaries, to transport an innumerable Company of Men. These Adventurers landing in the Northern Parts, and taking their way through <hi>Holderness,</hi> destroyed all the Towns, with their Inhabitants; and coming to <hi>York,</hi> provoked <hi>Osbriht</hi> to come out and fight them, where
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:93814:212"/>
he and his Brother-King were both slain, as you have already heard.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The same Year <hi>Asser</hi> (in his Life of K. <hi>Alfred)</hi> tells us, That the King married the Daughter of <hi>Aethelred</hi> the Ealdorman of the <hi>Gaini, i. e.</hi> of the Country about <hi>Gainesburrough</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire.</hi>

Nor did they discharge their Fury upon this Nunnery alone, but upon all the rest of the Monasteries of the <hi>Northumbrian</hi> Kingdom, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not long before destroyed the Monasteries and Church of <hi>Linais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farne,</hi> with those of <hi>Girwy</hi> and <hi>Weremuth,</hi> besides the famous Nunneries of <hi>Streanshale</hi> and <hi>Tinmuth</hi>; most of which were never rebuilt, and those that were, not till several Ages after.

               <p>But since the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals are very short in this Relation, I shall give you from <hi>Ingulph</hi> a more particular Account of what they did this Year in their march into <hi>East England,</hi> who further adds; That Winter being ended, the <hi>Danes</hi> took Shipping and went into <hi>Lindisse</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> and landing at <hi>Humberstan,</hi> spoiled all that Country, at which time that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and ancient Monastery of <hi>Bardney</hi> was destroyed, the Monks and all others being slain in the Church without Mercy; and when they had there stayed, wasting the Country for the whole Summer: About <hi>Michaelmas</hi> they did the like to the Country of <hi>Kesteven,</hi> in the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, where they committed the same Murders and Desolations.</p>
               <p>The same Year, in the Month of <hi>September,</hi> Count <hi>Algar</hi> drew toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the Youth of <hi>Hoyland</hi> (now called <hi>Holland</hi>) in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> with two Knights his Senescals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Wibert,</hi> and <hi>Leofric,</hi> who marched in the Head of them, together with a brave Body of 200 Men belonging to <hi>Croyland</hi> Abbey, who being all stout Fellows, were led by one <hi>Toly,</hi> then a Monk, but formerly a famous Souldier among the <hi>Mercians</hi>; these taking with them about 300 stout and warlike Men more from <hi>Deping, Lanioft,</hi> and <hi>Boston,</hi> to whom also joyned <hi>Morchar,</hi> Lord of <hi>Branne,</hi> with his strong and numerous Family, and being met by the Sheriff of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln,</hi> a valiant and ancient Souldier, with the <hi>Lincolnshire</hi> Forces, all which mustering together in <hi>Kesteven</hi> on St. <hi>Maurice</hi>'s Day, they joyned Battle with the <hi>Pagans,</hi> where GOD gave them the Victory, three Kings being slain, with a very great multitude of Souldiers; the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians pursued the Pagans to their very Camp, where finding a stout Resistance, Night at last parted them, and the Earl drew back his Army.</p>
               <p>But it seems there returned that Night to the <hi>Danish</hi> Camp all the rest of the Princes of that Nation, who dividing the Country among them, had marched out to plunder; their names are Barbarous, and too long to be repeated, but their chief Kings were <hi>Godrum</hi> and <hi>Basseg,</hi> and their Earls or Leaders, <hi>Hingar</hi> and <hi>Hubba,</hi> with others, who then returned with great Forces, and a multitude of Captives, and a great deal of Spoil; and their coming being known, the greatest part of the Christians struck with terrour fled away; whil'st those that were left, early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after hearing Divine Service, and receiving the Sacrament, being resolved to dye for Christ, and in Defence of their Country, marched into the Field against their Enemies; but the Earl perceiving his Forces to be too much weaken'd appointed Fryer <hi>Toly</hi> with his Five Hundred Men to Fight in the Right Wing, because they were the strongest; and Earl <hi>Morchar</hi> with those who followed him, as also the Sheriff of <hi>Lincoln</hi> making other Five Hundred in the Left Wing; whilest he with his Senescals kept the main Body, as ready to help either Wing if there were occasion; but the <hi>Danes</hi> being now enraged at the slaughter of their Men, having buried their Three Kings at a place, which is thence called <hi>Trekingham</hi>; afterwards 2 Kings and 8 Counts marched out, whilst the rest guarded the Camp, and Captives; but the Christians, because of their smaller Number, drawing themselves up in one Body, made with their Shields a strong <hi>Testudo</hi> against the force of their Enemies

               <p>So likewise of the destruction of the Monastery of <hi>Medeshamstead,</hi> this Author hath given us a larger account than what we find in this Copy of the Annals, <hi>viz.</hi> That four days after the destruction of <hi>Croyland,</hi> the <hi>Danes</hi> march'd towards that Monastery, where finding the Gates lock'd, they began to make an assault upon it; but receiving a Repulse, at the second assault, <hi>Tuba</hi> the Brother of Count <hi>Hubba</hi> being knocked down with a Stone, was carried off for Dead, whereat <hi>Hubba</hi> was so enraged, that breaking into the Monastery he slew all the Monks that came in his way, whilest the rest of them destroyed the others, till at last all perished, so that in short, the Monastery was wholly destroyed, and the Church,

               <p>But the fourth day after this the Pagan Army having got together all the spoil they could, marched toward <hi>Huntington</hi>; but in their way thither, as the two Counts <hi>Sidrocs</hi> brought up the Rear of the Army, which had now passed the River <hi>Nene,</hi> two Waggon loads of rich moveables happened to be sunk in the Ford, as also the Beasts that drew them, in getting out of which, whilest <hi>Sidroc</hi> and his Men were busied, the Boy <hi>Turgar</hi> slipped away into the next Wood, and walking all Night about break of Day he got to <hi>Croyland,</hi> where he found the Monks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again, and busie in quenching the Fire, as well as they could; to whom he related all that had happened, and discovering where the body of the Abbot and most of the Monks lay, they removed the rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish, and buried them, and then having chosen <hi>Godric,</hi> one of the Monks that escaped, for their Abbot, they were resolved to go and do the like Pious Office for the late Prior and Monks of <hi>Medeshamstead,</hi> where arriving, they buried the Bodies of above fourscore Monks in one Grave in the Church-yard, placing over them a Pyramidal Stone of about a Yard high, whereon were carved the Images of the Abbot and Monks about him, which was then to be seen in <hi>Ingulph</hi>'s time.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the <hi>Britains</hi> spoiling the Country as far as <hi>Grant-bridge</hi> (now <hi>Cambridge,</hi>) they then fell upon, and burnt the famous Nunnery of <hi>Ely,</hi> killing all that were therein both Men and Women, and carrying away a great deal of Riches, which had been brought thither from all parts for their better security; from whence they passed over into the Country of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> where they slew Earl <hi>Wulketule</hi> coming against them, and making a stout resistance with his small Forces, from whence they marched against King <hi>Edmund</hi> himself, of whose Life and Martyrdom, I shall out of <hi>Asser</hi>'s Annals, give you a particular account; and thô I will not pass my word for the truth of all his Relation, being written after the manner of the Legends of those times, yet the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it is no doubt true, and the rest may serve, if not to instruct, yet at least to divert the Readers.</p>
               <p>But before I proceed to the Story of the Martyrdom of this King, it may not be amiss to relate the occasion, why the <hi>Danes</hi> invaded the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> and put King <hi>Edmund</hi> so cruelly to Death, which story thô it be not very probable; yet since it is found in <hi>Mat. Westminsters Flores Historiarum,</hi> I will from thence repeat it in as few words as I can, being to this effect; That in the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark</hi> there was one <hi>Lothbrook,</hi> who being descended from the Royal Family, had by his Wife two Sons, <hi>Inguar</hi> and <hi>Hubba: Lothbrook</hi> going to Sea by himself, in a Boat, with only a Hawke on his Fist, to seek for Game in a Neighbouring Island, being taken by a sudden and violent Storm, was tossed up and down for several Days, till at last he was by the Wind and Tide driven upon the Coast of that Country, we now call <hi>Northfolk</hi>: where being found alone with his Hawk, he is presented to <hi>Edmund</hi> the King, and being kindly received for the comliness of his Person, continued in his Court, and told the King the Tale of his strange For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and often went out in the Field for his Recreation, with <hi>Beorn</hi> the King's Huntsman, being extraordinarily dexterous both in Hunting and Fowling; for this Reason, this Huntsman greatly envied him,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:93814:215"/>
and as they two were hunting together alone, he secretly murdered him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCLXX.</note> and hid his Body in a Wood. Now <hi>Lothebroc</hi> kept a Greyhound, which was exceedingly fond of him, and the Huntsman being gone away with the rest of the Dogs, he stayed there alone by his Master's Body; next day, when the King asked for <hi>Lothebroc, Beorn</hi> answered, <hi>That the day before he stayed in the Wood, and since that he had not seen him.</hi> But behold, the Greyhound comes to Court, and fawning upon the King, as well as others, as soon as he had filled his Belly, again departed; till doing this often, he was followed to the place by some of the King's Servants, who there found out the Body, and brought the Relation of it to the King: The Matter being examined, and found out, the Hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is sentenced to be put into the same Boat in which <hi>Lothebroc</hi> arrived, without any Oars or Tackling; in which, after a few days, (surely the Boat knew its way,) he was cast upon the Coast of <hi>Denmark,</hi> where being brought to <hi>Lothebroc</hi>'s Sons, and by them examined what was become of their Father, whose Boat they sufficiently knew, he affirmed, That he was killed by <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi> King of the <hi>East Angles</hi>; Whereupon they prepare a Navy, and passing into <hi>England,</hi> landed first in the <hi>Northern</hi> Parts, and, as was said before, they grievously harass'd the Country of the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> and having brought it under Subjection, <hi>Hinguar</hi> quits his Company, and with a great Fleet sailed to <hi>East England,</hi> where King <hi>Edmund</hi> Reigned.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Saxo Grammaticus</hi> gives us quite another Account of the Death of these Prince's Father, whom he calls <hi>Regner, viz.</hi> That he was taken Prisoner in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and there killed in Prison by Snakes, where none, you must know, ever were, a Story altogether as probable as the former; so I have here given you, from several Authors, two different Accounts of the Reason of the <hi>Danes</hi> invading <hi>England,</hi> and shall leave it to the Reader to believe one, or neither, since as they cannot both be true, so neither of them seem very probable.</p>
               <p>This King <hi>Edmund</hi> had now Reigned five Years with great Affection of his Subjects, for, being a Prince of great Hopes, he was by the <hi>Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Favour,</hi> and <hi>Consent of the People</hi> of that Province, not only Elected, but rather forced to Rule over them. He had a Majestick Meen that became a King, and in his Countenance appeared a certain Air of Piety mixed with Meekness and Devotion. It was indeed but a short time he Reigned, but in that time he did by his Charity to the Poor, and his Care over Widows and Orphans, perform all the Duties of a Pious Man, as well as of a Good King.</p>
               <p>But to come to the Story it self: The <hi>Danes,</hi> having now spoiled the Country, and routed the King's Army, as you have heard, came on a sudden upon a certain City, and taking it by Surprise, they killed the Inhabitants, and ravished the Women, sparing neither Age nor Sex; but when they had pretty well satiated their Fury, <hi>Hinguar</hi> their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain examined some of the ordinary People that were left alive, where their King used to reside; but here our Author supposes the King to have never yet resisted them, and therefore that they would first seizeon him, to prevent him from raising any Forces against them; which is not at all likely, especially since the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals tell us expresly, that King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> had already fought against him, and been put to flight: But this seems more probable, that the King being then fled to one of his Houses in the Country, called <hi>Heglesdune,</hi> was by the <hi>Danes</hi> discovered: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Hinguar</hi> sent one of his Servants on a Message to him, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:93814:216"/>
of which was,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCLXX.</note> 
                  <q>That Earl <hi>Hinguar,</hi> his Lord, commanded him to deliver up all his Treasures, and that he should submit himself and his Kingdom to his Power, which if he refused to do, he should then be deprived both of his Kingdom and Life.</q> To which the King answered, <hi>That he would never renounce the Vow he had made in Baptism, and being made King by the General Consent of the whole People, he was resolved never to do any thing to the Prejudice of the Common-weal of the</hi> English <hi>Nation, nor ever to submit his Neck to any Yoke but that of Christ, whose Example he now intended to imitate, and by his Grace would Suffer for his Name:</hi> And so he bid the Messenger return, and tell this to his Master. It seems the King had no sooner finished what he had to say, but as the Messenger was going back with this Answer, <hi>Hinguar</hi> himself met him, to whom having told what the King had said, he immediately commanded his Men to enter the Palace, and to lay hold of none but the King, and He, being there soon found, was immediately tied, and brought before the Captain, who commanded him first to be cruelly beaten, and then bound to a Neighbouring Tree, to be inhumanly whipped; all which he manfully endured, still calling on the Name of Christ: Whereat his Enemies being enraged, in a most barbarous manner shot his Body so full of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, that it seemed capable of receiving no more; yet none of the Wounds killing him outright, <hi>Hinguar</hi> at last commanded one of his Souldiers to cut off his Head; which our Author describes with a great deal of Monkish Eloquence: This being done, and leaving his Body there, they carried away the Head along with them, that so it might not be buried with it; but at last they flung it into a Wood, (which <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Tinmouth,</hi> in his <hi>Historia Aurea,</hi> calls <hi>Heglesdun;)</hi> but the People, after they were gotten out of their Hiding-places, began to look for it, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving long searched up and down the Wood, they at length heard the Head when they cried out to one another, <hi>Where are you</hi>? Answer (in <hi>English,) Here, here:</hi> Nor ceased repeating those words, till they came where it lay. As for this part of the Story, it sounds so like a Legend, that I shall leave it to be swallowed by those who are apt to be taken with such Things. I have no more to add, but that King <hi>Edmund</hi> Suffered on the 12th of the <hi>Kal.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> in the Year above-mentioned: But enough in Conscience, if not too much, of this King's Martyrdom, who had afterwards a Church and Monastery erected to his Memory, as you will find when you come to it; for it is certain, the <hi>English Saxons</hi> attributed as great Sanctity to this, as to any of their ancient Saints, and had as great a Belief of his Miracles, his Body being preserved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt (whether by Art or Miracle I shall not determine) for many Ages after.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I have no more to Remark under this Year, but that now <hi>Ceolnoth</hi> the Arch-Bishop deceased, and <hi>Ethelred</hi> Bishop of <hi>Wiltun-scire</hi> was Elected Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in his stead.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Also that the Town of <hi>Dunmoc,</hi> being now destroyed by the <hi>Danes, Helmham</hi> in <hi>Norfolk</hi> continued to be the sole Bishop's See for the Kingdom of the <hi>East Angles,</hi> till it was long after removed to <hi>Norwich.</hi>

               <p>But thô <hi>Asser,</hi> the Writer of King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Life and Actions, hath for his Honour attributed the whole Success of this Battle to that Prince; yet it is more probable what the Manuscript, called <hi>Scala Chronica,</hi> (cited by Mr. <hi>Speed,</hi>) relates, That when Prince <hi>Aelfred</hi>'s Men, being now spent,

were ready to Retreat,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCLXXI.</note> King <hi>Ethered</hi> came into the Battle from his Prayers; and so well seconded his Brother with fresh Forces, that renewing the Fight, the Victory (the greatest they had ever yet obtained) was chiefly owing to their Valour.</p>
               <p>But Fifteen Days after this, King <hi>Aethered,</hi> with his Brother <hi>Aelfred,</hi> marched again towards <hi>Basing</hi> to fight the Enemy, where another Battle happened, and the Pagans, making there an obstinate Resistance, obtain'd the Victory, and kept the Field; after which Fight; a fresh Army of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans coming from beyond Sea, joyned themselves to the former.</p>
               <p>But here the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals further add, <q>That about two Months after this, King <hi>Aethered,</hi> and <hi>Aelfred</hi> his Brother, fought again with the Pagans at <hi>Meretune</hi> (now <hi>Merton</hi>) in <hi>Surrey,</hi> where the Army being divided into two Parts, at first put the Enemy to the Rout, and had the better for a great part of the day; yet at last, after a mighty slaughter, the <hi>Danes</hi> kept the Field, and there was slain Bishop <hi>Heamund,</hi> with abundance of brave Men.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After this Battle, during the whole Summer following, the <hi>Danes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in quiet at <hi>Reading</hi>; but the same Year King <hi>Aethered,</hi> having now for five Years stoutly and nobly Govern'd his Kingdom, thô with many Troubles, deceased, and was buried in the Monastery of <hi>Winburne</hi> in <hi>Dorsetshire.</hi> But thô the Chronicle that goes under the Name of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot <hi>Bromton,</hi> (from I know not what Authority,) relates this King to have died of the Wounds which he had received in a Fight against one <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> a <hi>Danish</hi> King, who had newly destroyed the Town of <hi>Reading</hi>; and the Inscription on this King's Tomb at <hi>Winborne,</hi> (cited by <note n="*" place="margin">Tit. <hi>Dorset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</hi>
                  </note> Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> in his <hi>Britannia,)</hi> relates him to be slain by the <hi>Danes</hi>; yet since neither <hi>Asser, Ingulph,</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals, nor <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> mention any such thing, and that the Inscription it self is but Modern, I rather suppose him to have died a natural Death of the Plague, which then reigned.</p>
               <p>This King is said, by the Annals of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to have had a Daughter named <hi>Thyra,</hi> married to <hi>Gormun,</hi> King of the <hi>Danes,</hi> who on her begat <hi>Sweyn,</hi> the Father of King <hi>Cnute.</hi> This <hi>Ethered</hi> had also seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sons, as <hi>Alfred,</hi> supposed to be Grandfather to <hi>Ethelwerd,</hi> called <hi>Quaestor</hi> the Historian; as also <hi>Oswald,</hi> who his Father mentions in his Charter to the Abbey of <hi>Abingdon.</hi>

These he had named <hi>Ytair Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeth,</hi> and left them unto three of his Sons, <hi>Anarawd, Cadhel,</hi> and <hi>Mervyn,</hi> who were called <hi>Ytrit Twysoc Talaethioc,</hi> that is, the three Crown'd Princes, because each of them did wear upon his Bonnet, or Helmet, a Coronet of Gold, being a broad Lace or Head-band indented upwards, set and wrought with precious Stones; which, in the <hi>British</hi> or <hi>Welsh</hi> Speech, is called <hi>Talaeth</hi>; and to which Mr. <hi>Vaughan,</hi> in his Additional Notes to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoc</hi>'s History hath added, out of an ancient <hi>Welsh</hi> Manuscript, That this <hi>Rodorick</hi> is said to have corrected some of the old <hi>British</hi> Laws, and to have appointed new ones: He also ordained, that his Eldest Son should have the Crown, or Coronet of <hi>Aberffraw,</hi> with the Fifteen <hi>Cantreds</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging. This <hi>Aberffraw</hi> is now a small Village in the Isle of <hi>Anglesey</hi>; and was anciently the chief Seat of the Princes of <hi>Guyneth,</hi> or <hi>North-Wales:</hi> He left to his second the Crown or Coronet of <hi>Dinevowr</hi> or <hi>Cardigan,</hi> with its fifteen <hi>Cantreds,</hi> extending from the Mouth of the River <hi>Devi</hi> to the Mouth of <hi>Severne</hi>; and also that his Son should have the Crown, or Coronet of <hi>Mathraval,</hi> with the Fifteen Cantreds of <hi>Powis,</hi> from the mouth of the River <hi>Dee,</hi> to the bridge over <hi>Severne</hi> at <hi>Gloucester.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ordained also, That his Eldest Son, and his successours should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the payment of the ancient tribute to the King of <hi>London, (i. e.</hi> King of <hi>England</hi>) and that the other two, their Heirs and Successours, should acknowledge his Sovereignty, and pay the like tribute to him and his Successours; and that upon the Invasions of Strangers, they should all send him aid, and be also ready to protect them, when there should be need.</p>
               <p>Moreover he ordained, That when any difference should arise between the Princes of <hi>Aberffraw,</hi> and <hi>Cardigan,</hi> the Three Princes should meet at <hi>Bwlchy Pawl,</hi> and after hearing of Council on both sides, the Prince of <hi>Powis</hi> should be Umpire between them.</p>
               <p>And if the difference were between the Kings of <hi>Aberffraw,</hi> and <hi>Powis,</hi> that they should likewise all Three meet at <hi>Dolhrianedd,</hi> (perchance <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varhianed,</hi> on the Bank of the River <hi>Dee</hi>) where the King of <hi>Cardigan</hi> was to end the Controversie.</p>
               <p>And if there should be any difference between the Kings of <hi>Powis,</hi> and <hi>Cardigan,</hi> the meeting should be at <hi>Llyswen,</hi> upon the River <hi>Wy,</hi> and the King of <hi>Aberffraw</hi> to decide it.</p>
               <p>This, thô it seems to have been as wise a course as could be taken to maintain amity in a divided Kingdom, yet did prove of no effect; for it seems the Princes of these Countries did not long observe this Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of their Ancestour King <hi>Rodoric,</hi> but perpetually weakned each other with Civil Wars; so that the <hi>English</hi> taking advantage of their mutual divisions, by assisting the weaker Prince against the stronger;

               <p>About this time <hi>Anarawd,</hi> the Eldest Son of <hi>Rodorick</hi> above mentioned, began his Reign over <hi>North-Wales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Year (according to <hi>Asser</hi>) the <hi>Danes</hi> stealing away privately after the Feast of <hi>Epiphany</hi> to <hi>Cypenham,</hi> and having now got Horses, marched through all the Country of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> and there began to fix their Quarters; forcing many of the Inhabitants beyond Sea, and subjecting the rest of their Dominion, in so much that King <hi>Alfred</hi> was forced with a few of his Nobles, and with some Souldiers and Vassals, to lurk among the Woody and Boggy parts of <hi>Somerset-shire,</hi> where he led a very uneasie Life, in great Trouble and Scarcity, having no Provisions but what he could take away by frequent incursions from the Enemies, or else those Christians who had submitted themselves to their Dominion; and it is found in the Life of St. <hi>Neot,</hi> as he lay hid with a certain Cow-herd, it happened one day, that as his Wife was making of Cakes, the King sate by the Fire, fitting up his Bow and Arrows, and other Weapons; but when the Woman saw the Cakes which lay before the fire begin to burn, she presently ran and removed them, and chiding the King, (whom she did not know,) said thus, <q>Doest thou, Fellow think much to turn these Cakes, which thou can'st eat fast enough when they are baked?</q> At which the King laughing, took all in good part; but be the Story true or false, this much is certain, that the King lay at this time so private, that neither his Friends nor Enemies could tell where he was; in so much that all this while the Royal Patrimony became a prey, as well to the revolting <hi>English,</hi> as to the <hi>Danes</hi> themselves.</p>
               <p>But the Monkish writers of these times, (according to their usual Custom of interpreting all misfortunes to be God's Judgments) will needs have this to be a judgment upon this King, because that in the beginning of his Reign, being taken up with the desire of Learning, or else diverted by Hunting and other Juvenile Pleasures; he had too much neglected the public affairs; and that being admonished by St. <hi>Neot,</hi> and refusing to amend, the Holy Man foretold, there would be a time, when he should be driven from his Kingdom, and from his own House.</p>
               <p>But be this as it will, whilest King <hi>Alfred</hi> was thus over-powered by the great multitude of <hi>Danes</hi> that daily entred the Kingdom, he was forced to retreat; yet even then, being followed by a small band of Stout and Loyal Souldiers, he often set upon the Enemies by surprize, and with so good success, that he let them see, though he was overcome by numbers, yet he was not vanquished, since he remained formidable even in his flight; but to this Retreat, the then Woody and Bogy parts of <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> between the Rivers <hi>Thone</hi> and <hi>Parret</hi> chiefly contributed, which were then almost an Island, and not to be enter'd without a Boat, unless by one narrow way, (as <hi>Leland</hi> in his <hi>Itinerary</hi> hath rightly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) but <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> tells us, That it is to no purpose to relate all the little Skirmishes and Adventures of this King, during his Retreat; only one passage will not be unpleasant, whether it be true or false, it happen'd one Day that whil'st King <hi>Alfred</hi> lay pivate in a little Castle, or Fort, in the Wood <hi>Athelney,</hi> it being Winter time, and the Waters frozen up, he sent out his followers to seek for some Fish or Fowle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might sustain Nature, so that none were left at home, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

                  </note> or else lay concealed some where else;) but the King having to pass away the time taken up a Book, and began to read, (as his custom was, when he had nothing else to do) a certain poor Man knocked at the door, and begged an Alms; whereupon the King calling to his Mother, desired her to see if there was any thing for him to eat; but she told him, that there was no more than one Loaf left, and this would not be enough for the whole Company when they returned home; the King hearing this, said no more, <hi>but let God be blessed for all his gifts,</hi> then praying his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to bestow half of it upon this poor Christian, further added, that he who had fed 5000 Men with Five Loaves and Two small Fishes, could also, if he pleased, make half a Loaf suffice their necessities; whereupon his Mother complying with his desire, and the poor Man having got more than he looked for, went his way, but the King having read till he was tired, happened to fall asleep, and dreamt that he saw St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> (formerly Bishop of <hi>Lindisfarne</hi>) coming to him, and telling him, that he was sent from God to let him know, that he was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to put an end to the long and grievous punishments which the <hi>English</hi> had hitherto suffered for their Sins; and that the Alms which he had just now bestowed, was so acceptable in his sight, that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store him to his Kingdom, and said, as a sign of this, his Servants, who were then gone out a Fishing, thô with very small hopes of catching any thing, should return home so loaded, that he should look upon it with wonder; but that which is more strange, his Mother fell also a sleep, and dreamed the like Dream at the same time, as she told the King her Son when he awaked her; but whilest they with great astonishment discoursed of this Miracle, his followers returned home, bringing Fish enough with them to have served a little Army, if there had been occasion.</p>
               <p>But be this Story true or false, it is certain that not long after, the King received news, that <hi>Hinguar</hi> and <hi>Hubba,</hi> returning out of <hi>Wales,</hi> (where having made a great slaughter of the <hi>Britains,</hi> they had past the Winter) and being lately landed in <hi>Devon-shire</hi> with Twenty three Ships, there met with some of the King's party, by whom their Captain with, 1200 Souldiers were slain, near the Castle of <hi>Kenwith,</hi> the manner of which was thus; <hi>Odun,</hi> Earl of <hi>Devon-shire,</hi> with many others of the King's Subjects, upon the arrival of <hi>Hubba,</hi> had fled hither for refuge; but when the <hi>Danes</hi> knew the Castle was but weakly fortified, and they within were not provided of things necessary for a Siege; they then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to sit down before it, supposing that the <hi>English</hi> would quickly surrender for want of Provisions; which they being also sensible of, were endeavouring to prevent, and resolving either to obtain the Victory or dye; they sallyed out early one Morning upon the Enemy, who lay Encamp'd without any good Guards, so falling upon them at unawares slew <hi>Hubba</hi> their Leader, with his whole Army, except a few who were forced to flee to their Ships.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>King <hi>Aelfred</hi> being now much encouraged with the news of this good success of the <hi>Devon-shire</hi>-men, began to consider how he might perform some worthy action against the Enemy; therefore this Year, (as the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals relate,) having first fortified with his slender Forces a small Castle or Fort at <hi>Aetheling-gaige</hi> (now called <hi>Athelney</hi> in <hi>Somersetshire)</hi> where he had resided hitherto; he marched from thence the Seventh Week after, and with his Subjects and Vassals there, to fight against the <hi>Pagans</hi>; and it is also about this time, that we may place that memorable action of this King which is thus related by <hi>Ingulph,</hi> and <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> which if true, shews not only his great Courage, but Conduct too; for knowing the Enemy to exceed him in numbers, as well as other advantages, and that if he should set upon them with open Force he would be able to do them little, or no prejudice, nor could he hope for any better success, unless he knew in what condition the Enemie's Army was, and not having any one whose Sagacity or Fidelity he could well trust, he was resolved to go himself to spy out the Enemie's Camp: so taking upon him the Habit of a Country Minstrel (or Fidler) he went with only one Companion into the <hi>Danish</hi> Camp, where he became so acceptable, as well for his Singing, as Playing, that at last he was introduced to the King's Tent, and when he had there, as well as in the rest of the <hi>Danish</hi> Camp, learnt as much as he had a mind to know, he again returned to his Castle at <hi>Athelne</hi>; where having called together all his chief followers, he related to them the careless condition of the Enemies Camp, and with what ease they might be destroyed: whereat they being extraordinarily sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised, he then resolved to muster up what Forces he could.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So the Seventh Week after <hi>Easter,</hi> he march'd to <hi>Ecgbyrth-stan</hi> (now supposed to be <hi>Brixstan</hi> in <hi>Somerset-shire,)</hi> lying on the East side of <hi>Selwood</hi> Forest, where met him all the <hi>Wilt-shire, Somerset-shire</hi> and <hi>Hamptshire</hi> Men; who were mightily pleased to behold their King after so many hazards; but staying there only one night, he marched away to <hi>Iglay,</hi> (where the place was is not very well known,) and there encamped another night, in which (as <hi>Asser</hi> relates) St. <hi>Neot,</hi> who had been formerly his Kinsman, and Friend, appeared to him in a Dream, and bid him not be afraid of the great Army of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> because God would now have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him and his People; and that what had happen'd to him, was for his too great Arrogance in his Youth, and that God would Fight for him and his People: The King you may be sure was much rejoyced at this Dream, and failed not to encourage his Men with it; so the next Morning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving his Camp from thence, he came in one Day more to <hi>Ethandune,</hi> (but where it is we cannot tell) where the <hi>Danes</hi> lay encamped, and marching against them in very close order, he fought their whole Army, and though they did for a long time stoutly resist the frequent charges the King's Men made upon them, yet at last they gave ground, and beginning to flee he obtained a notable Victory, making a great sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCLXXVIII.</note> That the King should receive from them what Hostages He should name, but He not to return any to them; so they made such a Peace with him, as they had never done with any King before; for they swore that they would depart his Kingdom, and that <hi>Gythram</hi> (or <hi>Gutrum</hi>) their King should become a Christian, all which was performed, for about Three Weeks after the said King with about Thirty more of his Chief Noblemen came to the King, being then at <hi>Alrey</hi> (the place is now unknown) only that it lay near <hi>Athelney</hi> above-mentioned, where King <hi>Alfred</hi> receiving him from the Font at his Baptism, became his Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So this next Year the <hi>Danes</hi> (according to their promise) removed from <hi>Cippenham</hi> (i. e. <hi>Chippenham</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire</hi>) to <hi>Cirenceaster,</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>But now another Army of <hi>Pagans,</hi> arriving from beyond the Sea, sailed up the River <hi>Thames,</hi> to whom (notwithstanding their former Oaths) the Army that was here before also join'd, and took up their Winter Quarters at <hi>Fullanham</hi> (now <hi>Fulham,</hi> not far from <hi>London,)</hi> and the same Year (according to the Annals) the Sun was Eclipsed for one whole hour; also now part of the <hi>Pagans</hi> who had quartered at <hi>Cirencester,</hi> (as say the Annals and <hi>Asser)</hi> marched from thence under the Conduct of King <hi>Gythrum,</hi> into the Kingdom of the <hi>East-Angles</hi>; and dividing the Country among them, began to inhabit it; which, having been in their possession ever since the Death of King <hi>Edmund,</hi> King <hi>Alfred</hi> now yielded up to their King <hi>Gythram</hi>; but those <hi>Danes</hi> who had before staid at <hi>Fulham,</hi> now sailed into <hi>Frankland,</hi> and quartered at <hi>Ghent</hi> for one whole Year; from whence you may observe, that what we now call <hi>Flanders</hi> was then accounted part of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Frankland.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>The First Article is, That it is agreed that the Limits of K. <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Land are first upon the <hi>Thames,</hi> then proceed they to the River <hi>Lee,</hi> as far as his Fountain; then straight to <hi>Beaford,</hi> and then along the River <hi>Ouse,</hi> as far as <hi>Watling-street</hi>; which I suppose, is thus to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood; that K. <hi>Alfred</hi> did hereby grant him <hi>East-England</hi> and <hi>Essex</hi>; so that the bounds of these Kings Dominions were first the <hi>Thames,</hi> then the River, <hi>Lee,</hi> as far as <hi>Harford,</hi> whereabouts it arises: Then from <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> to <hi>Bedford,</hi> all along <hi>Watling-street,</hi> and then from <hi>Bedford</hi> all along the <hi>Ouse</hi> to the Sea.</q>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This was the League it self, with some other Articles needless to be here recited; the Preface to which declares, That it was made betwixt the two Kings, <hi>Aelfred</hi> and <hi>Gythrum,</hi> (so the <hi>Saxon</hi> Original,) by Consent of all the Wise Men of the <hi>English,</hi> and of all those that inhabited <hi>East England,</hi> and that not only in behalf of themselves, but of their Posterity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This sufficiently shews, that the <hi>Eastern</hi> Parts of <hi>England</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the <hi>Danes</hi>; yet <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> calling this King by the Name of <hi>Gormon,</hi> vehemently contends, that he had not that Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon him. <hi>Krantzius</hi> also denies, that this <hi>Gormon</hi> was conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Faith; yet confesses, that about this time one <hi>Froto</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: But whatever they write, this League sufficiently evinceth the Distinction of their Territories, and the Testimoy of <hi>Asser</hi> is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollable as to his Baptism, who lived himself at this very time, not to mention that the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals also affirm the same thing.</p>
               <p>After which follow the Ecclesiastical Laws, said in their Title to be made between King <hi>Alfred</hi> and King <hi>Gythrum,</hi> as they are to be found in Abbot <hi>Brompton</hi>'s Chronicle.</p>
               <p>The First of which is, That the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>English</hi> should Love and Serve the true GOD alone, and Renounce <hi>Paganism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the next place, That if any should Renounce his <hi>Christianity,</hi> and Relapse to <hi>Paganism,</hi> then he should pay his <hi>Weare, Wite,</hi> and <hi>Lashlite,</hi> according to what he had done.</p>
               <p>The Third Law is, That if any in Holy Orders shall either Fight, Perjure himself, or commit Fornication, let him likewise make Amends by the like Penalties above-mentioned; and likewise make Satisfaction to GOD according to the Canons of the Church; and also give a Pledge or Security to do so no more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That the <hi>Weare, Wite,</hi> and <hi>Lashlite,</hi> above-mentioned, were all of them Fines, or Mulcts, which the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>English</hi> were to pay ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the value of their Heads, as hath been already shewn; but as for the last of these Words, Mr. <hi>Somner,</hi> in his <hi>Glossary</hi>; supposes it to
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:93814:221"/>
be purely <hi>Danish,</hi> and signified no more than the two former Words,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCLXXVIII.</note> but was so called in relation to the <hi>Danes</hi> alone, who were to undergo it; after which follow several Constitutions against the Offences of Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, against committing Incest, and with-holding of Tythes, and <hi>Rome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scot</hi> or <hi>Peter-pence</hi>; in all which Offences a <hi>Dane</hi> was to pay the like <hi>Weare,</hi> and <hi>Wite,</hi> with an <hi>English-man</hi>; as also against Buying, Selling, and Working on the <hi>Lord's Day</hi>; in which Cases, if a Freeman wrought upon Holy-days, he was to lose his Liberty, or pay his <hi>Wite,</hi> but if he were a Servant or <hi>Villain,</hi> he was to satisfie it with his Skin, <hi>(i. e.</hi> by Whipping,) or pay his <hi>Head-Gild</hi>; but if a Master compelled his Servant to work upon Holy-days, he was to pay his <hi>Lashlite</hi> as the <hi>Danes,</hi> and his <hi>Wite</hi> as the <hi>English</hi> did, that is, according as he was a <hi>Dane,</hi> or an <hi>English-man</hi>; (which sufficiently justifies Mr. <hi>Somner</hi>'s Sense of that Word:) The rest of these Laws being against divers other Offences, as against violating the Fasts of the Church, against making <hi>Ordeal,</hi> or taking an Oath on Sundays or Fast-days. Not that this <hi>Ordeal,</hi> or Trial by a hot Iron, or boyling Water, in case the Person was accused of a Crime, was to be used, unless there was no direct Proof against him. The rest of the Laws are against putting any Man to Death upon a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; as also against Witches, Perjured Persons, and Common Whores, all which Persons were to be banished the Country.</p>
               <p>But the last Law saving one, is a sort of Cruel Mercy; for thereby if a Man had lost any of his Members for any Crime, and survived the same four Nights, it was afterwards lawful with the License of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop for any one to give him Help and Assistance, which it seems before that time it was not lawful to do.</p>
               <p>But the Reader may further from the Title of these Laws observe, the Subjection or Dependence which King <hi>Gytrum</hi> then had upon K. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi> at that time; for King <hi>Gytrum</hi> and his <hi>Danes</hi> gave their Consent to them in a Common-Council of the Kingdom, in the same manner as the Kings of <hi>Mercia,</hi> and of the <hi>East Angles,</hi> were wont to do in the General Council of the <hi>West Saxon</hi> Kingdom, in acknowledgment of its Superiority over them, as may be proved by divers Examples; and if this King <hi>Gytrum</hi> could have made Laws by his own Authority, he might have called a Council of his own to do so, which we do not find he ever did, having received his Kingdom wholly from the Bounty of King <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred.</hi>

Now also <hi>Marinus,</hi> that Religious Pope, sent some of the Wood of our LORD's Cross to <hi>Alfred,</hi> and in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the King sent to <hi>Rome</hi> the Alms he had vowed by the Hands of <hi>Sighelm</hi> and <hi>Ethelstan</hi>: Also he sent other Alms into <hi>India,</hi> to St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> (who being there martyr'd, are accounted the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Apostles.) And about that time the <hi>English</hi> Army lay encamped against the <hi>Danes,</hi> who held <hi>London,</hi> where yet (thanks be to GOD) all Things succeeded prosperously.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Also this Year, (according to the Chronicle of <hi>Mailross,</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi>) King <hi>Alfred</hi> having slain the two <hi>Danish</hi> Captains, <hi>Ingwar</hi> and <hi>Halfdene,</hi> caused the wasted Parts of <hi>Northumberland</hi> to be again In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited; then <hi>Edred</hi> the Abbot, being so commanded by <hi>Cuthbert</hi> in a Vision, redeemed a certain Youth who had been sold to a Widow at <hi>Withingham,</hi> and made him King of <hi>Northumberland</hi> by the joynt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent both of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> King <hi>Alfred</hi> himself confirming the Election. This King <hi>Guthred,</hi> in Gratitude to St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> did also bestow all the Land between the Rivers of <hi>Weol</hi> and <hi>Tyne,</hi> and says upon that Saint, that is, upon the Bishop of <hi>Lindisfarne,</hi> who this Year removed the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's See from thence to a place then called <hi>Concacestre,</hi> now <hi>Chester</hi>; and thither they also removed the Body of St. <hi>Cuthbert.</hi> But as for the Miracle of the Earth's opening and swallowing up a whole Army of <hi>Scots,</hi> who came to fight with King <hi>Cuthred,</hi> I leave it to the Monks to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them, if they please. This is certain, that thus making this poor Youth King, the Church got all that Country now called the <hi>Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> of <hi>Durham.</hi> And who can tell but all this Vision was a Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Abbot <hi>Edred</hi>'s, for that very Design; yet if it were so, it was but a Pious Fraud, which highly tended to the enriching of that Church.</p>
               <p>The same Year (according to <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi>) died <hi>Asser,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Shirburne</hi>; who could not be the same with that <hi>Asser,</hi> who writ the Life and Actions of King <hi>Alfred,</hi> since that Author writ to <hi>Anno</hi> 993, being the 45th Year of King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Age, as appears by that Work. Arch Bishop <hi>Usher</hi> supposes this <hi>Asser</hi> the Historian to have been he, who was afterwards the Bishop of St. <hi>David</hi>'s and was the second of that Name who sate in that See; but without any good Authority.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But the rest of the <hi>Danes</hi> of <hi>East England,</hi> were so much incensed at this Victory; as also with the slaughter of their Country Men, that setting out a greet <hi>Fleet</hi> very well Mann'd, they sail'd to the mouth of <hi>Thames</hi>; where setting upon divers of the King's Ships, by surprize in the Night, when all the Men were asleep, they had much the better of them; but what damage the King's Ships received, and how many Men were lost, our Authour does not tell us.</p>

                  <q>The same Year, somewhat before <hi>Christmass, Charles,</hi> King of the <hi>Western Franks,</hi> was killed by a wild Boar, which he was then hunting; but his Brother <hi>Lewis</hi> dyed the Year before: They were both Sons to that King <hi>Lewis,</hi> who deceased the Year of the last Eclipse, and he was the Son of that <hi>Charles,</hi> whose Daughter, <hi>Ethelwulf</hi> King of the <hi>West Saxons</hi> had married.</q>

                  </note>The same Year (according to <hi>Asser,</hi> as well as the Annals,) King <hi>Alfred,</hi> after so many Cities being burnt, and such great destruction of People, not only took the City of <hi>London</hi> from the <hi>Danes,</hi> who had it long in their Possession; but he now repaired it, and made it habitable; and then committed it to the Custody of his Son-in-Law, <hi>Ethered</hi> Earl of the <hi>Mercians</hi>; and now all the <hi>English, (viz.</hi>) the <hi>Mercians</hi> and <hi>Kentishmen,</hi> as also the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Saxons,</hi> who had been before dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed, or made Prisoners with the <hi>Danes,</hi> being now returned home, put themselves under King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Protection</p>

                  <q>Under the Year of our <hi>Lord,</hi> 886, <hi>viz.</hi> That in the Second Year of St. <hi>Grimbald</hi>'s coming over into <hi>England,</hi> the University of <hi>Oxford</hi> was founded; the first Regents there, and Readers in Divinity were St. <hi>Neot,</hi> an Abbot, an Eminent Professor of <hi>Theology,</hi> and St. <hi>Grimbald,</hi> and Eloquent and most Excellent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of the Holy Scriptures; whilst Grammer and Rhetorick were Taught by <hi>Asser</hi> a Monk, a Man of extraordinary Learning; Logick, Musick and Arithmetick, were Read by <hi>John</hi> a Monk of St. <hi>Davids</hi>; Geometry, and Astronomy were professed by <hi>John</hi> another Monk, and Collegue of St. <hi>Grimbald</hi>; one of a sharp Wit, and Immense Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>These Lectures were often honoured with the presence of the most Illustrious and Invincible Monarch, King <hi>Aelfred,</hi> which is also asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> who tells us a constant Tradition of his time, that King <hi>Alfred</hi> by the Advice of <hi>Neot</hi> the Abbot, first founded publick Schools of various Arts at <hi>Oxford</hi>; which is further confirm'd by an Ancient Manuscript Copy of <hi>Randolph Higden</hi>'s <hi>Polychron,</hi> in <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liol College Library,</hi> which in the beginning treating of all the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> when he comes to King <hi>Alfred,</hi> says thus, <hi>That he first founded the University of</hi> Oxford.</q> 
                  <hi>John Rouse</hi> in his Manuscript Treatise, <hi>de Regibus Angliae,</hi> (Lib. 1.) seems also to have seen this passage in <hi>Winchester</hi> Annals, and adds Three Halls to have been thus built, The one for <hi>Grammar,</hi> near the <hi>East Gate</hi>; the Second near the <hi>North-Gate</hi> for <hi>Logicians</hi>; and the Third in the <hi>High-Street,</hi> for <hi>Divines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But since this only proves that King <hi>Alfred</hi> first founded publick Schools here, and not that there was any such thing here before; I shall recite also what follows, as it is quoted by the said Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> out of an ancient Copy of <hi>Asser de Gestis Alfredi,</hi> which, I could wish may clear this point: <q>About this time (says he) there arose a sharp and grievous dissention between <hi>Grimbald,</hi> and those learned Men whom he brought hither with him, and the old Scholars whom he found here at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for these absolutely refused to comply with the Statutes, Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Forms of Reading perscribed by <hi>Grimbald</hi>; the difference proceeded to no great height, for the space of Three Years, yet there was always a private Grudge and Enmity between them, which soon after broke out with the utmost violence imaginable; to appease these Tumults, the most Invincible King <hi>Aelfred,</hi> being informed of the Faction, by a Message and Complaint from <hi>Grimbald,</hi> came to <hi>Oxford</hi> to accommodate the matter, and submitted to a great deal of Pains and

Patience, to hear the Cause and Complaint of both Parties:<note place="margin">

                     </note> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie depended upon this; The Old Scholars maintain'd, that before the coming of <hi>Grimbald</hi> to <hi>Oxford,</hi> Learning did here flourish, thô the Students were less in number, than they had formerly been, because very many of them had been Expell'd by the cruel Tyranny of the <hi>Pagans:</hi> They farther declar'd and proved, by the undoubted Testimony of their ancient Annals, that good Orders and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the Government of that place had been already made by Men of great Piety, and Learning; such as <hi>Gildas, Melkin, Ninnias, Kenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gern</hi> and others; who had there prosecuted their Studies, to a good old Age: All things being then managed in happy Peace and quiet; and that St. <hi>German</hi> coming to <hi>Oxford</hi> and residing there half a Year, after he had gone through all <hi>England</hi> to Preach down the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Heresie, did well approve of their Rules and Orders: The King with incredible Humility and great attention heard both parties, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them with Pious and Importunate entreaties, to preserve Love and Amity with one another; upon this he left them, in hopes that they both would follow his Advice, and obey his Instructions: But <hi>Grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald,</hi> resenting these proceedings, retired imediately to the Monastery of <hi>Winchester,</hi> which King <hi>Aelfred</hi> had lately founded: and soon after he got his Tomb to be removed thither to him, in which he had designed his Bones should be put after his Decease, and laid in a Vault under the Chancel of the Church of S. <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Oxford</hi>; which Church the said <hi>Grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald</hi> had raised from the ground, of Stones hewn and carved with great Art.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But since it must be confessed that this passage of the quarrel of St. <hi>Grimbald,</hi> and the Old Scholars of <hi>Oxford,</hi> is not to be found in that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Copy of <hi>Asser,</hi> which Arch-Bishop <hi>Parker</hi> first published in <hi>Saxon</hi> Characters (like those in which it is written, being still Extant in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library) yet though it was published by Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> in that Edition of <hi>Asser,</hi> which was printed at <hi>Frankford,</hi> in 1603. The Original of which the Lord Primate <hi>Usher</hi> in his <hi>Ant. Brit.

               <p>I shall therefore repeat in short what Mr. <hi>Ant. Wood</hi> hath answered to this Objection, in the <note n="*" place="margin">Page IX.</note> Antiquities of the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> from a Manuscript Testimonial, under the hand of the learned Mr. <hi>Twyne; viz.</hi> That he himself, long after discoursing with Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> on this Subject, and asking him expresly about this passage, whose authority began to be then questioned, <q>His Answer was, that he very well knew that he had truly transcribed, that passage from an ancient Manuscript of <hi>Asser,</hi> which he had then by him, and which as the said Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> in his Notes tells us, then belonged to Sir <hi>Henry Savile</hi> of <hi>Banke,</hi> near <hi>Halifax</hi> in <hi>York-shire.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But I shall not now take upon me to Answer the rest of the Objections which the said Sir <hi>John Spelman</hi> does there produce against the validity of the above cited passage; which supposes publick Schools to have been at <hi>Oxford,</hi> before King <hi>Alfred</hi>s time; for they are all reduceable to these two heads; First the express words of the Annals, of the Abbey of <hi>Hyde</hi> above-mentioned, as also that of <hi>Polychronicon,</hi> 
                  <q>That King <hi>Alfred</hi> was

               </p>
               <p>I confess there is one Objection, which I wish I could Answer; and that is, How <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Nennius</hi> could study at <hi>Oxford,</hi> when the latter was not so much as Born, till about the Conclusion of this, or Beginning of the following Century, and much less the Former; when even by the best Accounts of those Times, the <hi>Pagan Saxons</hi> were then Masters of that part of <hi>England.</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This was the Benevolence, called <hi>Peter Pence,</hi> which is here justly termed an <hi>Alms,</hi> and not a <hi>Tribute,</hi> as Modern Popish Writers have termed it.</p>
               <p>But to return to our own Domestick Affairs; <hi>Asser</hi> above-mentioned, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that the Kingdom being now pretty well at quiet from the <hi>Danes,</hi> the King began to mind his Civil Government, to repair his Cities and Castles, and also to build others in the most necessary places, altering the whole face of the Country into a much better form; and having walled several Towers and Castles, he made them defensible against the <hi>Pagans:</hi> Nor was he less careful in the Political Affairs of his Kingdom; for divers of his own Subjects, having, under the name of <hi>Danes,</hi> committed great Spoils and Rapines, these the King resolving to punish, and restrain from these Excesses, he first of all divided all the Provinces of <hi>England</hi> into Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and those again into Hundreds and Tythings; so that every Legal Subject should dwell in some <hi>Hundred</hi> or <hi>Tything,</hi> whereby if any were suspected of Robbery, and being thereof Condemned, or absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his Hundred or Tything, they should either undergo due punishment, or else if Innocent be acquitted.</p>
               <p>But the Governours of Provinces, who were before called <hi>Vice Domini,</hi> and in <hi>English Saxon Geriffs,</hi> he divided into two Offices, That is, into Judges, whom we now call Justices, and into Sheriffs, who do yet retain that name; and by the Kings care and industry in a short time, there was so great a Tranquility through out the whole Kingdom, that if a Traveller had happen'd to have lost a Bag of Money in the High-way, he might have found it again untouched the next day.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Bromton</hi>'s Chronicle relates, That thô there were Gold Bracelets hung up at the parting of several <hi>High-ways</hi>; yet Justice was so strictly executed, that no Man durst presume to touch them.</p>
               <p>But in the Distribution of his own Family, he followed the Example of King <hi>Solomon</hi>; for dividing it into Three Companies, or Bands, he set a Chief over each of them; so that every Captain with his Band, performed his Service in the King's Palace for the space of one Month; and, then going with his Company to his own Estate, he looked after his private Affairs for Two Months, and so did each of them in their Order, which Rotation of Officers this King observed all the rest of his Reign.</p>
               <p>And to this Year also, Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi> refers that Great Council wherein King <hi>Alfred</hi> made those Laws that go under his Name; in which, after a Preface, wherein he first recites and confirms the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as also divers other Laws, which are set down in <hi>Exodus</hi> and <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> he concludes to this effect, That whatsoever he found worthy of Observation either in the time of K. <hi>Ina,</hi> his Kinsman, or <hi>Offa,</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> or of <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> the first Christened King, he had gathered them all together, and committed those to writing which he thought most deserving, omitting others which he judged less convenient, in doing of which he had taken the Advice, and had the Consent of his Wise-Men,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:93814:225"/>
and having revised the Laws of those Princes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCLXXXVII.</note> he transcribed such of them as he liked into his own; and by the Consent of the said Wise-men he thereof made a Collection, and commanded them to be observed by all <hi>Englishmen</hi>; under which name the <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Jutes</hi> were then included.</p>
               <p>The first of his Laws requires (as most necessary to all his Subjects) that each Man keep his Oath or Pledge, (<hi>i. e.</hi> his promise to observe the Laws, and keep the Peace) and if any should be compelled to Swear, or deposite a pledge whereby he may be bound to betray his Lord, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly to assist any Person, he ought to break his promise, rather than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. But in case he hath engaged to perform any thing which might justly be done, and doth it not, his Arms and all his personal Estate shall be put into the hands of his Friends; and he himself kept in the King's Prison for Forty Days, till he undergo that Pennance which the Bishop shall enjoin him; and also his Friends (<hi>i. e.</hi> Relations) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of him: but if he have not wherewith to sustain himself in the mean while, if his Kindred are not able to provide him Victuals, the King's Officer shall do it; but if he resist and be taken by force, he shall forfeit both his Arms and his personal Estate; and if he be killed, nothing shall be paid as the Value of his Head: and in case he escape before his time, <hi>viz.</hi> of Forty Days be out, and be retaken, he shall be returned back again to Prison for other Forty Days: If he escape, he shall have no benefit of the Laws, but be Excommunicated from all Christs Churches, and if any Man have been security in his behalf, he shall make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for it according to Right, and do Pennance, till he make such sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction as his Priest shall appoint.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Second bears the Title of the Immunity of the Church, and we shall speak of it among the Ecclesiastical Constitutions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Third is, concerning the breach of the King's Surety-ship, by the payment of a Mulct of Five Pounds of <hi>Mercian, (i.e.</hi> larger Money) but the Violation of Surety-ship, (or the Peace) made to an Arch-Bishop by a fine of Three Pounds: and if any one break or forfeit the King's Pledge, (or Recognizance,) he shall make amends according to Right, and the breach of the Surety-ship to a Bishop or Ealdorman, by two Pounds.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Fourth Law is, concerning the Death of the King, or any other Lord; If any one, that, either by himself alone, or by any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, shall attempt against the King's Life, he shall lose his Life and Goods; but if he will purge himself, let him do it according to the valuation of the King's Head; the same is also ordained in all Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning other Men, whether Noble or Ignoble: whosoever Conspires against his Lord, shall lose both his Life and Estate; or else pay the Valuation of his Lord's Head.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From which Laws we may observe, That according to the custom of those Times, there was a Rate set upon every Man's Life, even upon the King's himself, if he were killed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:93814:225"/>
                  <q>The Seventh Law is, against Fighters in the King's Palace;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCLXXXVII.</note> If any Man shall Fight, or shall draw a Weapon in his House, his Life shall lye at the King's Mercy, whether he will Pardon him or not; but if the offender flee, and be taken, he shall redeem his Life, with the price of his head, or be fined according to his Offence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whereby it appears that the Offender might have redeemed this crime with Money at the first, or else the last Clause had been vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Ninth Law ordains, What mulct a Man shall pay, that Kills a Woman with Child, which was to be according to the Value of her head; and he was also to pay for the Child in her Womb, half as much as for a living one, according to the quality of its Father.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Tenth ordains, What fines or amends every Man shall pay to a Husband, for committing Adultery with his Wife; which was to be encreased according to the Estate, or Quality, of him against whom the Offence was committed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The rest of the Law, being about the quantity of the mulcts appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for several Thefts, I omit.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Eleventh appoints, What mulct a Man shall pay, that wantonly handles the Breasts of a Country Man's Wife, or offers her any Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as by flinging her down, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though he does not lye with her.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This shews how careful the ancient <hi>English Saxons</hi> were of the Persons and Chastity even of the meanest Subjects.</p>
               <p>I shall skip over a great many of the other Laws, they only ordaining penalties for several petty trespasses, and small Offences, and shall pass</p>
               <p>
                  <q>To the Twenty Sixth Law, Which appoints what mulcts shall be paid by those who shall Kill in Troops or Companies, and also to whom these Mulcts were to be paid. If the Slain and Innocent Party were an Ordinary Person, (that is, one whose head was valued but at Two Hundred Shillings,) he that slew him must pay the value of his head, and a Fine besides to his Kindred: Also every one that was in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, must pay Thirty Shillings; which Penalty was still to be encreased, according to the Value of the Estate of the Party Slain; so that as the Penalty for the Death of a Man valued at Twelve Hundred Shillings, every one that was present shall pay 120 Shillings, and the Man slayer himself the price of his Head, and a Fine besid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s: But in case the whole Company shall deny that he gave the Mortal Wound, all of them are to be impeached together, and to pay both the Value and the Fine besides.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now concerning this Troop, or Company, which our <hi>Saxon</hi> Ancestors called <hi>Hlothe,</hi> how many Men made up one of them, the Reader may please to take notice, that by the Laws of King <hi>Ina</hi> they were to be above Thirty.</p>

                     </gap>CCLXXXVII.</note>
                  <q>The Twenty Seventh appoints, What share of the Mulct, or satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction a Man's Kindred by the Mothers side shall receive, in case he have no kindred on his Father's side; and what share those of his <hi>Guild,</hi> or Fraternity shall pay in case he have committed. Man-Slaughter in a quarrel, (<hi>viz.</hi>) The former shall pay a Third part, and the latter one half of the price of the head of the party slain.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But whether by those here mentioned of the same <hi>Guild,</hi> are meant such as were fellow Contributors to the same Parish Feasts in honour of the Saints, as was the Custom of those Times; or else (which is more likely) such as were bound together in the same Decenary, or Tything, it being very obscure, I shall not take upon me to determine.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Twenty Eighth Laws was made against publick defamers, or spreaders of false news, (whereby is meant spreaders of false news a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Government,) and Commands that such a one being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, shou'd suffer no less punishment, than the cuting out of his Tongue, except he redeem it by payment of the value of his Head, and even then he was afterwards to be esteemed of no Credit.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Thirtieth Ordains, That Merchants when they Land shall bring such as come on Shore with them, before the King's Officers in <hi>Folc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,</hi> and there declare their number, that they may be ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to answer any thing that shall be demanded of them in the said <hi>Folcmote</hi>; and if it happen that they bring many strangers on shore, that they also certifie this to the King's Officer in that said Assembly; that so they may be forth coming.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now considering the Times wherein King <hi>Alfred</hi> lived, when there was such flocking of Strangers, being Enemies, into <hi>England</hi>; this Law was very justly and seasonably made.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Thirty First inflicts upon him that shall put a <hi>Ceorles</hi>'s Man (that is an ordinary Country-Man) without any fault into Bonds, <hi>viz.</hi> A Mulct of Ten Shillings; upon him that beats such a one, Twenty Shillings; if he hang him up a-loft, Thirty Shillings; if he cut off his Hair to expose him like a Fool, Ten Shillings; if he shave his Head like a Priest, (yet bind him not) Thirty Shillings; and in case he only cut off his Beard, Twenty Shillings; but if he bind him, and shave his Hair like a Priest, then Sixty Shillings.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Which Law was no doubt made to restrain the Tyranny and Insolence of the <hi>English</hi> Nobility, who were wont before that Law too much to domineer over poor Country-Men, (here called Ceorles-men;) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it seems highly probable, that the Commons of <hi>England</hi> had then Representatives in the Great Council, or else it is not likely the Nobility would ever have lost that Power they then Usurped over them: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall leave it to the Indifferent Reader to Consider, whether the Common People of <hi>England</hi> were then such Slaves, as some late Writers would fain make them; since not only satisfaction was to be made for their
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:93814:226"/>
Lives, but also for the least injury, or abuse,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCLXXXVII.</note> that might be committed against their Persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Thirty Fourth Law imposes upon him that shall strike or fight in open Court, before the King's Ealdorman, both the value of his own head, and such a Fine besides, as shall be thought fit; and also 120 Shillings to be paid to the Ealdorman by him, that by thus draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Weapon shall make any disturbance in the <hi>Folcmote,</hi> or County Court; if the Ealdorman were not present, but the fact was done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Substitute, or the King's Priest, then a <hi>Were</hi> or <hi>Amerciament</hi> of Thirty Shillings.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here by the King's Priest, is meant either the King's Chaplain or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, I will not determine whether; who as we formerly said in those times presided also in the <hi>Folcmotes,</hi> and there dispatched all business re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Thirty Fifth ordains, What satisfaction shall be made for breach of the Peace in any other place; as for Example, he that fights in the home-stall of a Country-man, shall pay the said Country-man Six Shillings; if he drew his Sword, but struck not, half as much; which Penalty also was to be encreased according to the Estate or Quality of him upon whose ground the Assault was made: So that if he fought in the House of one worth 600 Shillings, he was to pay Three times as much; if of one worth 1200 Shillings, then the Amends was to be twice as much as the former.</q>
               </p>

                        </gap>rhbrice,</hi> or breach of the Peace, in a Town, confirms that part of King <hi>Ina</hi>'s Law, concerning that matter, in imposing upon the Offender, for the breach of the Peace in the King's Town or City, by setting the Mulct of an Hundred and Twenty Shillings; but if it be done in the Arch-Bishop's Town, then Ninety Shillings; in that of a Bishop or Ealdorman, Sixty Shillings; in the Town of a Man valued at 1200 Shillings Estate, Thirty Shillings; but half as much if done in a Village of one worth but half that Sum.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From whence we may observe, That in those times not only the King and the Great Men, such as Bishops and Ealdormen, but also Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of ordinary Estates, had Villages or Townships of their own; and they themselves received the Mulcts or Penalties imposed for the breach of the Peace within their Precincts; which priviledge they lost, I suppose, after the coming of King <hi>William.</hi> I.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Thirty Seventh is, That Law concerning <hi>Bocland,</hi> by vertue whereof he that holds Lands left him by his Ancestors, was forbid to alienate it from his Kindred to others, in case it could be proved by Writing or Testimony, before the King, or the Bishop, his Kindred being present, that the Man who first granted them, forbid him all Alienation, and laid on him this Condition.</q>

                  </note>From the making of this Law Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> informs us, that we may here find an Estate in Fee-Tail, much more ancient than the thirteenth Year of <hi>Edward</hi> the First.</p>
               <p>The 38th Law is concerning Quarrels, or deadly Feuds, which, since it gives a strange Licence for Men to take Satisfaction on their Enemies, even without the Presence of any Officer, I shall likewise set down:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>First, It forbids any Man to attack his Enemy, if he find him in his own House, except he first demand of him Satisfaction: But if he have force enough, he may besiege the House for seven days, yet he shall not assault him, if he will stay within; but if he then surrender himself, and his Arms, into the Defendant's hands, he may keep him thirty Days, without hurt, but then shall leave him so to his Kindred or Friends. In case he flie to a Church, the Honour of the Church is to be preserved: But if the Demandant have not Strength enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege him in his House, he may desire the Assistance of the Ealderman, which, if he cannot obtain, he must appeal to the King before he can assault him. If any one by chance light upon his Adversary, not knowing that he keeps himself at home, and he will deliver up his Arms to him, he shall keep him safe thirty Days, and then deliver him to his Friends: But in case he will not deliver up his Arms, then he may fight with him; but if he be willing to deliver up himself, and his Arms, to his Enemy, and any other Man sets upon him, such a Man shall pay the value of his Head, if he kills him; or give Satisfaction for his Wounds if any be given him, according to the Fact; besides which, he shall be fined, and lose all that may fall to him, by reason of Kindred.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From whence you may observe, that the nature of that Rough and Martial Age, did allow Men a greater Liberty of righting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against those that had injured them, than was afterwards thought fit to be allowed in more settled and peaceable Times.</p>
               <p>The last of King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Laws is concerning Wounds and Maims, which being very long, I shall only give you an Abstract of it. It is, (in short,) to appoint what Satisfaction in Money any Man shall pay for wounding or maiming another, or for cutting off any Member or part of his Body, even to the Nail of his little Finger: All which was ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained according to the particular Sums there set down; and I shall leave it to wiser Judgments to consider, whether it would not be better if the Law were so at this day, since it would not only prevent the too great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Juries in some Cases, but also their over-Severity in others, by often giving either very small, or else excessive Damages, according as the Plaintiff or Defendant is more or less known to them, or that they have a greater or less Kindness for them.</p>
               <p>There was likewise made in the same <hi>Synod</hi> divers Ecclesiastical Canons, some of which, taken from amongst the Civil Ones, I shall here likewise set down.</p>
               <p>The first is concerning the Immunities of the Churches, by which it is ordained, That if a Man, guilty of any little Crime, flie to a Church, which does not belong to the King, or the Family of a private
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:93814:228"/>

                     <hi>Anno Dom·</hi> DCCCLXXXVIII.</note> unless in the mean time he can make his Peace: But if any Man, within that Term, shall inflict upon him either Bonds or Blows, he shall pay the Price of his Head, according to the Custom of the Country; and also to the Ministers or Officers of the Church 120 Shillings, for violating the Peace thereof.</p>
               <p>The next Law but one is likewise to the same effect, whereby is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to every Church, consecrated by the Bishop, the like Peace, and if any Offender shall flie to it, none shall take him thence for seven Days; if any Man shall presume to do so, he shall be culpable of breaking the King's and Churche's Peace: If the Officers shall have need of their Church in the mean time, he shall be put into another House, which has no more Doors than the Church; only the Elder, (<hi>i.e.</hi> Presbyter) of that Church shall take Care he have no Meat given him: But if he will surrender himself, and his Arms, to his Enemies, he shall be kept thirty Nights, and then be delivered up to his Kinsmen. Also, whosoever shall flie to a Church for any Crime, which he hath not yet confess'd, if he shall there make Confession of it, in God's Name, half the Penalty shall be remitted to him.</p>
               <p>From whence you may observe the Antiquity and Design of Sanctuaries in <hi>England,</hi> which were not then (as they were afterwards,) abused, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at first only intended for Places where Offenders might stay for a time, 'till they could agree with their Adversaries or Prosecutors, as well as they could; since almost all Crimes whatever were redeemable with pecuniary Mulcts in those days.</p>
               <p>The 5th Law is, that if one shall steal any thing out of a Church, he must restore the value, and also forfeit as belongs to an <hi>Angild</hi>; the meaning of which you may see in the next Law.</p>
               <p>The 6th Law is, That if any one shall steal on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> or on <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> or <hi>Easter,</hi> or <hi>Ascension</hi>-days; the Forfeiture should be as belongs to an <hi>Angild, (i. e.)</hi> the whole value of his Head; Also the Hand with which he stole was to be cut off: But if he would redeem his Hand, it should be permitted him to compound for it, according as it should appertain to his <hi>Were, (i. e.)</hi> the Price of his Head.</p>
               <p>Besides which Laws, <hi>Alfred,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Rieval,</hi> in his <hi>Geneal. Regum Angliae,</hi> mentions another Law of this King's, whereby every Freeman of the Kingdom, having two Hides of Land, was obliged to keep his Sons at School 'till they were 15 Years of Age, that so they might become Men of Understanding, and live happily; for (said the King in this Law,) a Man Free-born, and unlettered, is to be regarded no otherwise than a Beast, or a Man void of Understanding.</p>
               <p>The 12th is concerning the Breach of the Peace by Priests: If a Priest kill any one, he should be taken, and all his Estate confiscated; and also the Bishop should degrade him, and put him out from the Church, unless his Lord would obtain his Pardon by the Price of his Head. The rest, being concerning the Penalties for the Violation of Nuns, I omit.</p>

               <p>What the <hi>Danes</hi> did immediately after their Landing, our Annals men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not; but we may with great probability hither refer that Action, (touched upon in our Annals, which are very confused and obscure in the Relation of this War) <hi>viz.</hi> That it is most likely the Kings Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged <hi>Haestein</hi> either at <hi>Middleton,</hi> or <hi>Beamfleot</hi>; where not long after his Landing, he had built a strong Fort on the opposite Shore, and being redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the King to great Extremities, he was forced to surrender himself with his Wife, and his Two Sons to the King's Mercy, upon Condition that they should be Christened; which being done, (the King, and <hi>Aethered,</hi> Ealdorman of <hi>Mercia,</hi> being their Godfather;) <hi>Haesten</hi> gave the King Hostages, and solemnly swore to depart the Kingdom; but as soon he got loose, he broke all those Agreements, and retiring into <hi>Beamfleot</hi> there fortified himself a fresh.</p>
               <p>And the Spring after <hi>Aethelward</hi> assures us, That passing along the great <hi>Forest</hi> of <hi>Andredeswood,</hi> they then wasted the adjacent Countries of <hi>Hamptshire,</hi> and <hi>Berkshire</hi>; but the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals affirm, that about a Year after the <hi>Danes</hi> had raised that Fort, (I suppose of <hi>Middleton</hi> above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned), in the East part of the Kingdom, K. <hi>Alfred</hi> the better to secure himself, caused the <hi>Danes</hi> of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and <hi>East England,</hi> to take an Oath to be true to him; and the King also compell'd the <hi>East Angles</hi> to give him Hostages: yet nevertheless they broke this Peace; for when the <hi>Danes</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> went out of their Ships in Troops to Plunder, they also went with them, or else the <hi>Danes</hi> carried the Prey into their Territories; wherefore King <hi>Alfred,</hi> gathering together his Army, and marching forward, Encamp'd between Two Parties of these <hi>Danish</hi> Robbers, where by reason of Woods, as also of Water on both sides, he had a very convenient place for that purpose, insomuch that he could set upon either Party whenever they marched into the Country to Plunder; but they Robb'd in Troops, as well on Horse-back as on Foot, in all Parts where the King's Army was not; yet were repulsed almost every Day, as well by the King's Forces, as by the Neighbouring Towns: For

the King had now divided his Forces into two Bodies,<note place="margin">

And when they were got into their Garisons and Ships in <hi>East Saxe,</hi> just before Winter, they Muster'd a great Army from among the <hi>East Angles</hi> and <hi>Northumbers</hi>; and committing their Wives, Ships and Goods to the keeping of the <hi>East Angles,</hi> marched Day and Night, till they took up their Quarters at a certain City in <hi>Werheal,</hi> called <hi>Legacester,</hi> (now <hi>Chester</hi>;) but the Kings Forces could not overtake them before they had got into the Castle, which nevertheless they besieged for about Two Days, and took away all the Cattle that were in those Parts, and kill'd all the Men they could find without the place; and partly burnt the Corn, and partly devoured it with their Horses: This was done about a Twelve Month after the <hi>Danes</hi> arrival here.</p>
               <p>Not long after this the <hi>Pagans</hi> went from <hi>Werheal</hi> into <hi>North Wales,</hi> but they could not stay there long because the Cattle and Corn were all drove away and destroyed;<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Also the same Year the <hi>Danes,</hi> who were encamp'd in <hi>Meresige,</hi> drew their Ships up the <hi>Thames,</hi> and thence up the River <hi>Ligan,</hi> (now called <hi>Lee</hi>) which divides <hi>Middlesex</hi> from <hi>Essex</hi>; and there according to <hi>Florence</hi> they began to raise a Fort; this happen'd in the second Year after their arrival.</p>

               <p>This Autumn, when the King had pitched his Camp in those Parts about Harvest time, to hinder the <hi>Danes</hi> from carrying away their Corn, it happen'd one day, as the King rode by the River side, that he found a place where the River might be so diverted, that the <hi>Danes</hi> should not be able to carry back their Ships; and thô they had built two Castles, one of each side the River to defend them; yet so soon as the <hi>Danes</hi> saw that (the stream being now diverted into several Channels) they could not carry back their Ships, they quitted them, and marched away on Foot, till
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:93814:231"/>
they came to <hi>Quatbrige</hi> (now supposed to be <hi>Cambridge,</hi>

               <p>But the next Year, according to our Annals, The <hi>Danes</hi> marched part of them into <hi>East England,</hi>

But I have only noted the most remarkable.</p>
               <p>The same Year, those Robbers residing in <hi>East-England,</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> very much infested <hi>West Saxony,</hi> especially the <hi>Southern</hi> Coasts, by their stolen Booties; chiefly with their Ships which they had got ready long before for that purpose; then King <hi>Alfred</hi> (being it seems at last sensible how much damage the want of a Fleet had done his Country) Commanded divers Galleys to be made which were almost twice as long as others, some whereof had sixty Rowers; they were also swifter, higher, and less apt to rowle than others formerly built, for they were made neither according to the model of the <hi>Frisian</hi> Vessels, nor the <hi>Danish,</hi> but after such a manner, as was thought might prove most useful: And some time after in this Year, there arrived six <hi>Danish</hi> Ships at the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and Sailing along committed great spoil in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> and all up and down that Coast. Then the King commanded that they should set Sail with the Nine Gallyes newly built, and shut up the Enemies Ships from going out of the Harbour where they were; upon which the Pyrats sailed out with Three Ships against them, the other three being left in the entrance of the Harbour upon the dry ground, and the Sea-men gone out of them; But the King's Fleet took two of the <hi>Danish</hi> Ships that came out of the Harbour, and slew the Men, but the Third escaped, though all, except Five, were kill'd: There came also other Ships thither, which were somewhat more conveniently posted, Three of them being placed in that part of the Sea, where the <hi>Danish</hi> Ships had before taken up their station, but all the rest in another part, so that they could not assist each other, for the Tide had gone back many Furlongs from the King's Ships: And so the <hi>Danes</hi> going out of their Vessels set upon Three <hi>English</hi> Ships which lay on the dry ground, and Fighting with them, there slew <hi>Lucomon</hi> the King's Admiral, and <hi>Wulfherd, Aebba,</hi> and <hi>Aethelerd,</hi> being all <hi>Frize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> (who it seems then served in the King's Fleet) so that of the <hi>Frisons</hi> and <hi>English</hi> there were slain Sixty Two, of the <hi>Danes</hi> One Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Twenty: But the Tide returning, the <hi>Danish</hi> Ships got away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>English</hi> could have out theirs at Sea, thô they were so shatter'd, that they could scarce reach the Coast of <hi>Sussex,</hi> for two of them were

                  <hi>Asser</hi>'s History of this King's Life and Actions, give you a larger account of him from his Infancy.</p>
               <p>He was (as you have already heard) born <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 849, and had been twice at <hi>Rome,</hi> but after his last Return together with his Father, He tells us, He was bred up at Court with the great Care and Affection, both of his Father and Mother, who loved him above the rest of his Brothers, because he was not only more Witty and Handsome, but also of a sweeter Disposition; and it had been well if he could have improved his own excellent Parts by Humane Learning; for to his great regret afterwards, by the extream fondness of his Parents, or by the negligence of those who had the care of his Education, he remained till the Twelfth Year of his Age, without so much as being taught his Letters; only having an excellent Memory, he learned by heart several <hi>Saxon</hi> Poems, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repeated to him by others; for he had a great, and natural Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Poetry, as our Authour himself had often observed; and as an instance of the quickness of his Parts, gives us this Account, That one Day when his Mother shewed him and the rest of his Brothers a certain fine Book in <hi>Saxon</hi> Verse, with which they were very well pleased, he being taken with the beauty of the Capital Letters, at the beginning of it, she promised to give it to him that should soonest understand and get it by heart; which <hi>Alfred</hi> undertaking to do, he carried it to his Master, and not only learned to Read it, but also got it without Book, and so repeating it to his Mother, had the Book given him for his pains:
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:93814:232"/>
after this he also learned the Daily Office,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCCI.</note> and then some Psalms and Prayers by heart, which being writ together in a Book, he still carried in his Bosome for his daily use: But alas! <hi>England,</hi> could not then sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply him with any fit Tutors in the Liberal Arts, which he often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained was one of the greatest hindrances in his Life, that at the time when he had most leasure to learn, he had no Masters that could teach him; and afterwards when he grew more in Years, he was troubled with incessant Pains both Night and Day, the causes of which were unknown to Physicians, but when he came to be King, he was then taken up with the cares of the Government, and how to resist the Invasions of the <hi>Danes,</hi> so that he had but little time for Study; yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all these impediments from his very Child-hood, to the day of his Death, he never ceased to have an insatiable desire after knowledge; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he did not only at leisure times learn himself, but also communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated that learning to others, by translating into the <hi>English Saxon</hi> Tongue <hi>Orosius</hi>'s Roman, and <hi>Bede</hi>'s Ecclesiastical Histories, the latter of which Versions is Printed, but the former is still in Manuscript, in the Library of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Coll. <hi>Oxon.</hi> as also in other places: he had likewise begun to Translate the <hi>Psalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> but was prevented by Death, from making an end of it.</p>
               <p>But to how low an Ebb Learning was then reduced by the frequent Wars and devastations of the <hi>Danes,</hi> King <hi>Alfred</hi> himself tells us in his Preface to St. <hi>Gregorie</hi>'s <hi>Pastoral,</hi> that learning was so decay'd in the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Nation, that very few Priests on this side of <hi>Humber</hi> could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Common Service of the Church, and he knew none <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Thames,</hi> who could turn an ordinary piece of Latine into <hi>English,</hi> though things were now somewhat better, yet that he himself had turn'd this Book into <hi>English</hi> by the help of Arch-Bishop <hi>Plegmond,</hi> with <hi>Grimbald</hi> and <hi>John</hi> his Priests; and had sent one of them to every Bishops See in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with an <hi>Aestel,</hi> (as the <hi>Saxon</hi> Word is, or <hi>Stilus,</hi> as in the Latin Version) upon each Book of fifty <hi>Mancuses</hi> in value, charging them in God's Name, neither to take away that <hi>Aestel</hi> from the Book, nor any of those Books out of the Church, seeing it was uncertain how long there would continue such Learned Bishops, as now (God be Thanked) were in all parts of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But how this can consist with the supposed Relation out of <hi>Asser,</hi> concerning the flourishing state of Learning at <hi>Oxford,</hi> before that King's Founding the University, I do not understand.</p>
               <p>But in the Twentieth Year of his Age, as soon as he was Married, that Distemper took him which held him till about his Fortieth Year, the cause whereof being unknown to his Physicians, it was supposed by some, that he was bewitched, and it was so sharp that he feared the Leprosie or Blindness, or else some worse Distemper, which often makes Men unuseful or despised; but by Praying to God in a certain Church in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> (where St. <hi>Neot</hi> lay buried) and near which the King came by chance to Hunt, he was relieved of that Pain, which tho this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour does not tell us what it was, yet it seems to have been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what proceeding from the stoppage of the Humours in the lower Parts, and which our Authour calls the <hi>Ficus,</hi> or <hi>Emerhoids.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall now in the next place shew you, how this King spent his time, as well in his private as publick Affairs, as the same Author hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it; by which the Reader will be better enabled to frame a true Character of this most Pious, Learned, and Magnanimous Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:93814:232" rendition="simple:additions"/>King <hi>Alfred</hi> (notwithstanding his frequent hindrances,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCCI.</note> not only by the <hi>Danish</hi> Wars, but also his bodily Infirmities) was always mindful of the Affairs of State, thô at spare times he used Hunting (for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteation) and to oversee and direct his Artificers, Huntsmen and Faulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; He built also his Houses much more Magnificent than those of his Predecessors, and at leisure times was wont to read <hi>English Saxon</hi> Books, and learn Verses in the same Tongue by heart, so that he never failed when he was alone to imploy himself well. And for the better performance of his Duty, he vowed to bestow half his time (as far as his occasions and Infirmities would permit) in God's Service. And because it was impossible to know how the Hours of the Day and Night past, when often by reason of the Clouds the Sun could not be seen, (no Clocks being then invented) he began to think how he might distinguish the Hours by Night as well as by Day; and at last, by his own ingenious contrivance, he ordered Six Wax-Tapers to be made of equal length and bigness; so that each Taper being divided into Inches, and every Inch marked out upon the Taper; by this means those Six Tapers being set up one after another before the Reliques of the Saints, (which he still carried with him) gave a constant and certain Light during the whole Twenty four Hours, both by Night and by Day. But when sometimes by reason of the Wind, which came in at the Windows or Doors of the Chappel, or thorough the Chinks of the Walls, or the Cloth of his Tents; the Tapers were made to burn out sooner than they were used to do at other times; he first found out the Invention of making Lanthorns of Cow's Horns cut into thin Plates, whereby no Wind could wast the Tapers; so that by this Invention none of them burnt out sooner than another.</p>
               <p>Afterwards he endeavoured to perform his former Vow in dedicating half his time to God, so that he was wont not only to hear Mass every day, but also to repeat his Prayers, Psalms, and other Nocturnal Offices, having made a Collection out of <hi>David</hi>'s Psalms for his own private use; which being with certain Prayers written in a small Book, he always carried about with him in his Bosom; he likewise used to frequent the Church in the Night time, and there alone to say his Prayers: He was also very liberal in his Alms to Strangers, as well as his own People, treating all sorts of Men with great Gentleness and Affability, he would often hear the Scriptures read by his own Servants, and also Prayers read by Strangers, when he came to any place by chance: He loved his Bishops and all the Clergy very well, as also his Earls, Noblemen, and Servants; expressing his affection in Educating their Sons in his own Family, and by causing them to be constantly instructed in Letters and good Manners, with the same care, as if they had been his own Children: Yet for all this, the King was not satisfied, but was sorry that God had not made him more capable of true Wisdom, as well as Liberal Arts; admiring <hi>Solomon</hi> for nothing more, than that despising Riches and Worldly Glory, and desiring of God Wisdom, he thereby obtained not only those outward things, but this Request too over and above.</p>
               <p>Thus our King imitated the Bee, which rising early, gathers Honey from all sorts of Flowers; So whatever was rare, that he had not in his own Kingdom, he fetched from abroad: for about this time God favouring his Pious Desires, sent him <hi>Werfriht,</hi> after Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> one very well skilled in the Holy Scriptures, who by this King's Command, Elegantly

and exactly Translated the Dialogues of Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi>

               <p>These learned Men above-mentioned, King <hi>Aelfred</hi> had sent for out of <hi>Mercia,</hi> whose Erudition, as it daily encreased the King's Love to it, so his greedy Thirst after it could never be satisfied; for Night and Day, as often as he had leisure, he Commanded some or other to read to him, for he was never without one of them near him, whereby he obtain'd a general Knowledge of almost all sorts of Books; nor was he content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with those he found at home, but he sent Messengers into <hi>France</hi> to procure new Masters; fetching from thence one <hi>Grimbald</hi> a Priest and Monk, a worthy Man, and an excellent Chanter, and one well skilled in all Secular, as well as Ecclesiastical Learning; as also <hi>John</hi> another Priest and Monk, throughly versed in all manner of Litterature, by whose assistance, as the King's Mind became much inlarged, so in Requital he Honour'd and Enrich'd them.</p>
               <p>And here I may likewise add, what some other Authors have written concerning these two last Learned Persons, by whose assistance he first Founded the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> as hath been already related; for <hi>John Rouse,</hi> in his History of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> hath wrote of these two Monks, that <hi>Grimbald</hi> was sent for from his Monastery in <hi>Flanders,</hi> then counted part of <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> was from his of St. <hi>Bertin,</hi> at St. <hi>Omers</hi>; this is that <hi>John</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Erigena,</hi> (thô from whence he borrowed this last Name, I shall not determine, since the Learned dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer so much about it) 'twas he Translated <hi>Dionisius</hi> his <hi>Hierarchia</hi> out of <hi>Greek</hi> into <hi>Latin,</hi> which is now publish'd by the Learned Dr. <hi>Gale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the same time Asser also relates, that he was sent for by the King from the <hi>Western,</hi> or furthest Parts of <hi>Britain,</hi> (that is, from St. <hi>David</hi>'s in <hi>Wales</hi>) and being kindly received by him, he earnestly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to leave whatever he had on the other side of <hi>Severne,</hi> and Dedicate himself wholly to his Service; but he could not promise that for above six Months in the Year, standing engaged the other six to reside at his own Monastery; for the Abbot and Monks there hoped that by his Interest with the King, they might better avoid those Troubles and Injuries From King <hi>Hemeid,</hi> who had often spoiled that Monastery and Diocess; by the Expulsion of its Bishops, as he had done the Archbishop <hi>Novis,</hi> our Author's Kinsman; for he also tells us, that both at this time and long before, all the <hi>Countries</hi> on the South part of <hi>Britain</hi> did then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to King <hi>Aelfred</hi>'s Dominions; <hi>Hemeid</hi> with all the Inhabitants of <hi>South Wales,</hi> and <hi>Rodri</hi> with his six Sons having subjected themselves to his Empire; <hi>Howel</hi> also the Son of <hi>Rice,</hi> King of <hi>Gleguising, Brochmail</hi> and <hi>Fermail</hi> Kings of <hi>Guent</hi> being oppressed by the Tyranny of <hi>Eadred</hi> Earl of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> desired of the King, that he would please to take the Dominion over them, and be their Protector against their Enemies: Also <hi>Helised</hi> the Son of <hi>Teudyr</hi> King of <hi>Brechonoc</hi> being kept under by the power of the said Sons of <hi>Rodri,</hi> sought the Protection of the King, as did <hi>Anarawd</hi> the Son of <hi>Rodi,</hi> (together with his Brethren) who all at last forsaking the friendship of the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> by which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no advantage, but rather damage, came to the King desiring his favour, and were honourably received by him.</p>
               <p>

                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCCI.</note> submitted himself to the King's Dominion, together with all his Subjects, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising to be obedient in all things to his Royal Pleasure; neither did they desire the King's Friendship in vain, for those who loved to encrease their power obtained it, those who desired Money had it, those who only sought his Friendship enjoy'd it; but all of them did partake of his kindness and protection, as far as the King was able to defend them.</p>
               <p>Then our Author further adds, That after he had been with the King Eight Months, he gave him a grant of Two Monasteries, called <hi>Ambres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byri</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> and <hi>Banuwelle,</hi> together with all that was there, adding these words; That he had not now given these small things, but in order to bestow greater on him; for some time after he gave him also <hi>Exancester</hi> (now <hi>Exeter</hi>) with all the Lands that belonged to it in <hi>West Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Cornwal</hi>; besides other daily presents, too long here to recite, which he says, he does not relate out of vain Glory, but to set forth this King's Liberality. <hi>Note,</hi> That by <hi>Excester</hi> he means only the Abbey.</p>
               <p>Which also, as well as his Piety was very great; for the King had now order'd two Monasteries to be built, the one at <hi>Aethelingey,</hi> the place of his Retreat above-mentioned, putting Monks therein of divers Nations, because he could then find no Gentlemen nor Freemen of his own Country, that would undertake a Monastic Life; the other Monastery he built near the <hi>East-Gate</hi> of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> for an Habitation for Nuns, over which he made his own Daughter, <hi>Aethelgova</hi> Abbess, placing many Noble Virgins there, to serve God with her in a Monastic Life.</p>
               <p>All which being finished, he then considered how he might further add to what he had already done; and therefore being stirred up by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, he Commanded his Officers to divide all his Yearly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues into two equal parts, the first of which he allotted to secular Affairs; distributing it to skillful Artificers and Architects, who came to him from all parts far and near, whom he discreetly rewarded giving every Man according to his Merit; And the other half he dedicated to God, which he Commanded his Officers to divide likewise into four parts, so that one part should be discreetly bestowed upon poor Men of all Nations, that came to him; a second part was to be reserved for the two Monasteries which he had founded; a third for that School which he had made up of many considerable persons of his own Nation, as well as Foreigners. And which is supposed to have been the University of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the fourth part was to be sent some Years to the Monasteries in <hi>West Saxony</hi> and <hi>Mercia,</hi> and other Years to the Churches and Monks, serving God in <hi>Britain, France, Cornwall</hi> and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> nay as far as into <hi>Ireland</hi>; to each of them by turns according to his present Abilities. Nor did he only thus dedicate one half of his Revenues, but also one half of the Labours of his Body and Mind to God's Service, as hath been already declared.</p>
               <p>Nor was he less exact in all things else he undertook; for he was the Great Patron of the Oppressed, whose Cause and Defence he almost alone supported, having very little assistance from others; since almost all the Powerful and Great Men of that Kingdom rather addicted themselves to Secular, then Divine imployments, and pursued every one his own private Interest, without any consideration to the Common good: but the King in his Judgments studied the advantage as well of the meaner sort as of the

                  <hi>The Mirrour of Justices</hi> (a great part of which is supposed to be collected from divers ancient <hi>Saxon</hi> Records that are now lost,) may be credited, this King, condemn'd no less than Fourty four inferior Judges, in Hundred and County Courts, to be hanged, in one Year, for their false Judgments, either in condemning or acquitting Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Verdict of the Jury; but the particular Cases being many, and long, I refer you to the Authour himself, wherein you will see the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the manner of Judicial Proceedings in those Times, from what they were presently after the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest.</p>
               <p>But some of our Historians, as particularly <hi>Harding</hi> in his <hi>Chronicle,</hi> made this King to have collected a Body of Laws, not only out of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament,</hi> but also from the <hi>Greek, Roman, British,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Laws; which, if it were ever done, is not now extant.</p>

Aethelbald, Aethered</hi> and himself; so as that the Survivor of them should enjoy the entire Dominion of the whole Kingdom:</q> And then proceeds to shew the particular force of that Entail, according to his said Father's Will, in these Words, as he gives it us, speaking in the first Person.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That if it should happen, That <hi>Aethelbald,</hi> the eldest Son of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, should first decease, then <hi>Aethered,</hi> together with the Nobility of all <hi>West-Saxony,</hi> should be Witnesses for us of our Share in the said Kingdom, on the Day of his Coronation; whom we should with all our Might endeavour to <hi>advance to the Throne,</hi> after the Death of <hi>Aethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald</hi> our eldest Brother, according to the Agreement he made with us, <hi>viz.</hi> That the said King <hi>Aethered</hi> should permit us to enjoy our Distributions, as we had them before our said Brother's Coronation; And also the Engagement he stood in to us concerning the said Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Distribution, was confirmed in like manner, to wit, that the Lands and Territories, which K. <hi>Aethered,</hi> by our Assistance, and the Power of our Men, should acquire to himself; as also the Dominions which should fall to him by Hereditary Right, he should, in Brotherly Love, proportionably divide with us.</q> 
                  <q>But yet, if it should so happen, that <hi>Aethered</hi> should succeed to the Kingdom, he himself was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise the same thing: But he refusing, (as this Testament particularly takes notice,) to observe this Agreement, only promised, That as for the Lands and Territories which he, by <hi>Alfred</hi>'s and his People's Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance should acquire to his Dominions, as also the Inheritance to which he was born, he would, after his decease, confer upon none else but my self: And being thus pacified, I thereupon remitted all further Complaints against my Brother.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then he proceeds farther, <q>That in case it should happen, that we all should fall by the hands of our <hi>Danish</hi> Enemies, then it was especially provided, that every one of us should so dispose of our Estates to our Sons, that each of them should successively enjoy our Inheritance, and our Lands and Possessions in like manner, as the Inheritance it self, with the Dominions, Lands and Possessions, which had been before conferred upon us.</q> And then he goes on to recite what had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done in a General Council of the <hi>West Saxon</hi> Nobility at <hi>Swin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne,</hi> wherein he had adjured them all to bear witness of the manner and intent of the former Entail; the sum of which was, <q>That since K. <hi>Aethered</hi> his Elder Brother was deceased, there was then none left but himself, who had any writing or Testimony concerning this Inheritance, nor any other Heir besides himself; and that if any one should offer to claim the said Inheritance, he should lose his Right, unless he forthwith produced witnesses of it; but then he heard that all his Kinsmen were dead, and so the whole Inheritance of King <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelwulf</hi> his Father was devolved upon him, by a Charter made thereof at his General Council at <hi>Langdene</hi>; which Charter he had then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

               </p>
               <p>And to let you see that Entails were then in force,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>He farther Wills, That those to whom he had given his Free-Hold-Lands, should not alienate them beyond their own Lives, and if they had no Children they should go to the next of Kin, especially to the Eldest Son as long as any one of them remain'd alive; for so his Father had bequeathed his Inheritance; but if it should any ways happen that his said Lands should come into the hands of Women, then he Wills, That after their Decease those Lands should revert to his next Male Kindred descending from their bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And then concludes with an earnest Exhortation and desire, that none of his Relations should any ways disquiet each other concerning those things which he had already given and bequeathed to them; since the whole Nobility of the <hi>West Saxon</hi> Nation had already agreed with him, that it was but Just and Right that he should leave them as free as the Thought of Man could make them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is the substance of King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Will, which I have been the more particular in reciting, because it is one of the most Remarkable Pieces in our <hi>English Saxon</hi> Antiquities, and shews us the manner of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, not only to private Estates; but to the Crown it self in those Days. Thô we could have wished that the Original had been preserved, being in the <hi>English Saxon</hi> Tongue, of which this is only a Translation made by <hi>Asser</hi> at the end of this King's Life.</p>

               <p>King <hi>Alfred</hi> had born to him by the Queen his Wife above-mention'd, <hi>Aethelflede</hi> his Eldest Daughter, and after her <hi>Eadward</hi> his Eldest Son then <hi>Aethelgeofeu,</hi> or <hi>Ethelgiva,</hi> then <hi>Aelfthryth,</hi> and lastly <hi>Ethelweard,</hi> besides

               <p>But <hi>Ranulh Higden</hi> in his <hi>Polychron</hi> tells us, That having taken away a Nun along with him out of the Monastry of <hi>Winburne,</hi> he went over to the <hi>Danes,</hi> which if so, (as is most likely) the King could not then Apprehend her; but it seems King <hi>Edward</hi> followed him so close, that he forced him to go over into <hi>France,</hi> (as <hi>Mat.</hi> of <hi>Westminster</hi> relates) that he might there obtain more Recruits, to give the King fresh distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance; and therefore it is most probable, what <hi>Mat.

               <p>In the mean time (according to <hi>Mat. Westminster</hi>) the King improved his Dominions, by building new Towns, and repairing some Cities, which had been before destroyed.</p>

               <p>Who this <hi>Eoric,</hi> King of the <hi>Danes,</hi> was, is uncertain; I suppose him to have been the <hi>Danish</hi> King of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> whose death (according to <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi>'s Account) falls about this time, for he says thus; That this King was killed by the <hi>English,</hi> whom he treated tyrannically, but for all this, yet they could not recover their Liberty; certain <hi>Danish</hi> Earls still oppressing, or else inciting them against the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Kings; till the Eighteenth Year of this King's Reign; when they were all by him overcome, and the Country brought under obedience.</p>
               <p>To this time we may also refer that great Council, which was held by King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Elder,</hi> where <hi>Plegmond,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided; though the place where is not specified, yet the occasion of it (as we find from <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> as well as the Register of the Priory of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> cited by <note n="*" place="margin">Council, 1. Vol. <hi>p.</hi> 387.</note> Sir <hi>H.

over each of the <hi>Western</hi> Counties,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom</hi> DCCCCV.</note> dividing what Two Bishops had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly held, into Five Diocesses.</p>
               <p>The Council being ended, the Archbishop went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the King's Decree with the Advice and Approbation of the Chief Men of his Kingdom; He thereby, and with rich Presents, so pacified the Pope, that <hi>Plegmond</hi> obtain'd his confirmation thereof; and then returning into his own Country, he ordained five Bishops in one day, (to wit) <hi>Fridestan</hi> to the Church of <hi>Winchester, Aldestan</hi> to <hi>Cornwall, Werstan</hi> to <hi>Shireborne, Athelm</hi> to <hi>Wells,</hi> and <hi>Eadwulf</hi> to <hi>Crediton</hi> in <hi>Devonshire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Archbishop <hi>Parker,</hi> in his <hi>Antiq Britannicae,</hi> under this very Year thus recites this Transaction out of a very Ancient Manuscript Author, whom he does not particularly name; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Plegmund</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> together with King <hi>Edward,</hi> called a great Council of the Bishops, Abbots, Chief men, Subjects and People, in the Province of the <hi>Gewisses,</hi> where these two Bishopricks were divided into five.</p>
               <p>So that you see here was no less than five new Diocesses erected at once, by the Authority of both the King and the Great Council of the Nation, though, it seems, the Pope took upon him the confirmation of this Decree.</p>
               <p>The same Authors likewise tell us, That Archbishop <hi>Plegmond</hi> ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two more Bishops over the Ancient Provinces (to wit) one <hi>Bernod,</hi> for the <hi>South Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Cenwulf</hi> for the <hi>Mercians,</hi> whose See was at <hi>Dorchester</hi> in <hi>Oxfordshire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> in his Annals, having given us a Copy of these Letters of Pope <hi>Formosus,</hi> hath found a notable Error in the Date of them, for being written <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 904, or 905. they could not be sent by that Pope who was dead about 9 or 10 years before, and therefore the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal would put the time of this Council back to <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 894. but then as Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi> in his Notes upon it well observes, the fault will be as great this way as the other; for King <hi>Edward,</hi> under whom this Council was held, was not King till above 10 years after; therefore some would place this Council in the latter end of King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Reign, after the Kingdom came to be setled upon the expulsion of the <hi>Danes</hi>; but Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi> affirms, That these things being written long after the time when they were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, the name of <hi>Formosus</hi> might be put into the Copies of these Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, instead of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Fifth, and then all things will fall right enough. But as to <hi>Frithestan</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> this Account of <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> will not hold, for our Annals tell us, That he was not made Bishop till <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 910. upon the death of Bishop <hi>Denulph,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that See could not be so long void, as this Relation would have it. The like mistake is in making <hi>Werstan</hi> to be then Bishop of <hi>Shireborne.</hi>

               <p>But if Sir <hi>John Spelman</hi> thought he had Reason to suspect the Truth of that Passage we have cited out of <hi>Asser</hi>'s History of the Life of King <hi>Alfred,</hi> concerning the <hi>Studium</hi> or School at <hi>Oxford</hi> before King <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi>'s time, our Antiquaries may have as much (if not more) Reason to question the Truth of this Charter; since the Original of it is not to be found, but only this Transcript in the Book above cited; for they say it looks very improbable, that <hi>Cambridge</hi> should have continued an University during all the time of the <hi>Danish</hi> Wars, and under the Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of those three <hi>Danish</hi> Kings, the last of whom enjoyned it till the latter end of this King's Reign, as appears by our present History: And besides all this, the barbarous and pedantic Latine at the Conclusion of this Charter, where the King is made to confirm it in these Words. <hi>Stabili jure grata &amp; rata decerno durare, quamdiu vertigo Poli circa terras at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Aequora, Aethera Syderum justo moderamine volvet:</hi> Which seems to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the ignorant Monk's Pen that counterfeited it; but <hi>John Rouse,</hi> in his Manuscript History <hi>De Regibus Angliae,</hi> cited by <hi>Bale,</hi> relates from an ancient Table and Chronicle of the Abbey of <hi>Hyde</hi> near <hi>Winchester,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>All this happened in <hi>Autumn:</hi> And the same Year, a little before <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinmass,</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> marched with his Army to <hi>Buckingaham,</hi> and there stayed a Month, building two Forts on each side the River <hi>Ouse</hi>; before he parted thence, <hi>Thurkytel</hi> the <hi>Danish</hi> Earl owned him for his Lord, as also

                  <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library,) that it is found in an Ancient Chronicle, once belonging to the Monastry of <hi>Rochester,</hi> and collected by one <hi>Edmund de Hadenham,</hi> That this Year the Lady <hi>Elfleda,</hi> by the Assistance of the King her Brother, besieged the City of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and taking it, slew a great many <hi>Danes</hi> that were therein.</p>

                  <q>After this King <hi>Edward</hi> went to <hi>Maeldune</hi> (now <hi>Maldon,</hi>) and rebuilt the Town, and saw it fortified whilst he was there. Also Earl <hi>Thurkytel</hi> passed over into <hi>France</hi> by K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Leave and Convoy, with all those <hi>Danes</hi> that would follow him; as likewise <hi>Aethelfleda</hi> brought under her Dominion the Town of <hi>Legracester</hi> (now <hi>Leicester,</hi>) and a great many of the <hi>Danes,</hi> belonging to that place, became subject to her, as also those who were at <hi>York</hi>; nay, some of them confirmed it both with an Oath, and by giving of Hostages, that they would continue so; but as soon as this was done, she departed this Life twelve days before <hi>Midsummer</hi> at <hi>Tammeworth,</hi> it being the Eighth Year of her Government over the <hi>Mercians</hi> (after her Husband's Death,) with great Moderation and Justice: Her Body lies buried at <hi>Gleawcester</hi> in the East Isle of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Lady's Death is placed in our printed Annals, under the Year 918, and that more rightly, for the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Copy of these Annals is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly mistaken, in putting the Death of this Princess two Years later than this, <hi>viz.</hi> 920. though they all agree in Substance, <hi>viz.</hi> that she died at <hi>Tamworth</hi> about a Fortnight before <hi>Midsummer</hi>; and that thereupon King <hi>Edward</hi> going thither, the whole Nation of the <hi>Mercians</hi> submitted to him. But whenever this Princess died, she was certainly a Woman of great Virtue, Prudence, and Courage; and truly resembled her wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Father King <hi>Alfred,</hi> as far as the Difference of Sex would permit.</p>
               <p>But to return again to our Annals,</p>
               <p>The same Year the Daughter and Heir of <hi>Ethered,</hi> Lord of the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> called <hi>Aelfwinna,</hi> whom her Mother had left her Heir, was deprived by the King of that Dominion; and she was, about three weeks before <hi>Christmas,</hi> brought into <hi>West-Seax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Bevour,</hi> (who calls himself <hi>Castoreus,</hi>) in his Manuscript History of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> gives us a very good Reason, if true, why the King dealt thus severely with this young Princess his Niece, which was this; That <hi>Aelfwinna,</hi> not making the King her Uncle, (whom her Mother had appointed her Guardian,) privy to her Designs, had contracted a Mariage with <hi>Reginald,</hi> King of the <hi>Danes:</hi> Whereupon King <hi>Edward,</hi> to prevent his Enemy, entred the Country of <hi>Mercia,</hi> and took it into his own Hands, and also carried the said Lady away with him. The
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:93814:240"/>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCCXX.</note> and <hi>Griffyth ap Madoc,</hi> Brother-in-Law to the Prince of <hi>West-Wales,</hi> came from <hi>Ireland</hi> with a great Army to <hi>Snowdon</hi> in <hi>Caernarvonshire</hi>; and designing to bring <hi>all Wales</hi> and the Marches thereof to their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, over-ran and subdued all the Countrey as far as <hi>Chester,</hi> before ever King <hi>Edward</hi> had Intelligence of their Arrival; whereat he was very much offended; but being loath to trouble his Subjects in that behalf, he made a Vow, That he and his Sons with their own people, would be revenged on <hi>Leofred</hi> and <hi>Griffyth</hi>; and thereupon he came to <hi>Chester,</hi> and took the <hi>City</hi> from them: After this he made two Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Army, whereof he and his Son <hi>Athelstan</hi> led the first, and <hi>Edmund</hi> and <hi>Edred</hi> the second; and followed them with such Celerity, that he overtook them at the Forest of <hi>Walewode</hi> (now <hi>Sherwood),</hi> where <hi>Leofred</hi> and <hi>Griffyth</hi> set upon him so fiercely, that the King at the beginning was in some distress, until Prince <hi>Athelstan</hi> stepped in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Father and <hi>Leofred,</hi> and gave the <hi>Dane</hi> such a Wound in the Arm, that it disabled him from holding his Spear, whereupon he was soon taken, and committed to the Custody of <hi>Athelstan.</hi> In the mean time Prince <hi>Edmund</hi> and <hi>Edred</hi> encountering with <hi>Griffyth,</hi> slew him, and brought his Head to their Father: Upon that <hi>Athelstan</hi> caused <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi> to be beheaded likewise, and so both their Heads were set up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the top of the Tower of <hi>Chester</hi>; and <hi>Edward</hi> and his Sons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home with a great Triumph.</p>
               <p>But it appears by the Age of Prince <hi>Edmund</hi> when he came to the Crown, that this Relation concerning himself and his Brother <hi>Edred</hi>'s commanding part of their Father's Army, cannot be true; for he was not above Four years old when King <hi>Edward</hi> his Father died, and not above Eighteen when he began to reign.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This year (according to our Annals) King <hi>Edward</hi> commanded his men to go to the Town of <hi>Tofeceaster</hi> (now <hi>Tocester</hi> in <hi>Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>) and to rebuild it; after which, the same year about <hi>Lent,</hi>

                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCCXXI.</note> he commanded the Town of <hi>Wigingamere</hi> (now <hi>Wigmore</hi> in <hi>Hereford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>) to be rebuilt: But the same Summer, between <hi>Whitsuntide</hi> and <hi>Midsummer,</hi> the <hi>Danes</hi> of <hi>Hamptune</hi> (i. e. <hi>Northampton,</hi> as was said before) and <hi>Ligeracester,</hi> and those that lay <hi>Northward,</hi> broke the Peace, and marched to <hi>Tofeceaster,</hi> and assaulting the Town a whole day hoped to take it, but those that were within defending it until such time as more men could come to their assistance, the <hi>Danes</hi> were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to leave the Town, and march'd off: After this they often went out by night to plunder, and falling upon those that were unprovided, took a great many men and much Cattle, between <hi>Barnewoode</hi> and <hi>Eglesbyrig</hi> (the former of which was <hi>Barnwood</hi> Forest near <hi>Bury-hill,</hi> and the latter <hi>Alisbury,</hi> both in <hi>Buckinghamshire).</hi> About the same time the <hi>Danes</hi> of <hi>Huntandune</hi> (i. e. <hi>Huntington)</hi> and the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> marched out and built a Castle at <hi>Temsford,</hi> where they settled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for they had left that at <hi>Huntandune,</hi> supposing that from thence they might recover a greater share of the Countrey; and so they march'd till they came to <hi>Bedanford,</hi> but the men who were within it going out to meet them, killed great numbers of them, putting the rest to flight: After this a great Army of <hi>Danes</hi> being got together, advanced to the Town of <hi>Wiggingamere,</hi> and stormed it for most part of the day; but those who were within defending it very well, they
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:93814:241"/>
were forced to leave the Town,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCCXXI.</note> and retreat, carrying away with them all the Cattel they found thereabouts: After this also, the same Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, there were great Forces assembled of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Subjects from the Towns round about <hi>Temesford,</hi> whither they went, and laying close Siege to the Town, they at length took it, and kill'd a <hi>Danish</hi> King, and <hi>Taglosse</hi> an Earl, and <hi>Mannan</hi> his Son, together with his Brother, and all those who defended the Town.]</q> From which time (according to <hi>Florence)</hi> the <hi>Danish</hi> Power did by little and little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and that of the <hi>English</hi> increase. But this Author places all these actions of this year under <hi>Anno</hi> 917.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The same year a great many men assembled together in Autumn, as well from <hi>Kent, Surry,</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> as from the neighbouring Towns, and marching to <hi>Colneceaster</hi> (i.e. <hi>Colchester)</hi> assaulted that City till they took it, and all the Plunder they found in it, and killed all the men, except those that escaped over the Wall: After which also the same Autumn a great Army of <hi>Danes</hi> were got together with the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> both Land-Soldiers and Pyrates, whom they had invited to their assistance, hoping thereby to revenge the Defeat they had lately received; wherefore they went directly to <hi>Maeldune,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged that Town, till such time that more men coming to its assistance, the <hi>Danes</hi> were forced to quit it, and retreat; but the men who were within it, together with those that came to their assistance, overtaking the <hi>Danes,</hi> killed many hundreds of the Land-men as well as Pyrates; not long after which, King <hi>Edward</hi> marched with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of <hi>South-Saxons</hi> to <hi>Passenham</hi> (i. e. <hi>Pasham</hi> in <hi>Northamptonshire)</hi> and there continued till the Town of <hi>Tofeceaster</hi> could be encompassed with a Stone-Wall, where Earl <hi>Thurferth</hi> and the chief Commander of the <hi>Danish</hi> Forces that belonged to <hi>Hamtune,</hi> with all towards the <hi>North</hi> as far as <hi>Weolade</hi> (that is, the River <hi>Weland)</hi> accepted King <hi>Edward</hi> for their Lord and Protector; but about the time that the King's Army was to return home, he sent out fresh Forces to the Town of <hi>Huntandune,</hi> who repaired and rebuilt it in those places that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, according to the King's Command; so that all the people of that Countrey that ramained alive, surrendred themselves to King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and sought his Peace and Protection. Likewise this very year before <hi>Martinmass</hi> the King marched with an Army of <hi>West-Saxons</hi> to <hi>Colneceaster,</hi> and rebuilt the Wall, and repaired all places which were ruinous. Then many as well of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> as also of the <hi>East-Saxons,</hi> who were before under the <hi>Danish</hi> Dominion (and had been so for above thirty years), now delivered themselves up to the King, and also all the <hi>Danish</hi> Army in <hi>East-England</hi> swore Allegiance to him, promising to do whatever he thought good, and to defend his Subjects as well by Sea as by Land; but the Army that belonged to <hi>Grantanbyrig</hi> (i. e. <hi>Cambridge</hi>) did by themselves chuse the King for their Lord and Patron, confirming it by their Oaths as he had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.

               <p>And under this year I suppose we may justly place the total subduing of the <hi>Danes,</hi> and subjection of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> and consequently their being freed from the <hi>Danish</hi> Yoak, under which they had groaned for above fifty years; though what Government they had from the Death of the last <hi>Danish</hi> King <hi>Eoric,</hi> is hard to determine; <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>

the only Ancient Author that hath mentioned these Affairs,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCCXXI.</note> telling us in general, That after the Death of this <hi>Eoric,</hi> the <hi>Danish</hi> Earls or Governors either oppressed them, or else excited them against the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Kings, until this King <hi>Edward</hi> by driving out the <hi>Danes</hi> restored the <hi>English</hi> to their Liberties, and added this Kingdom to his own Dominions fifty years after the death of King <hi>Edmund,</hi> which falls out much about this time.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Polidore Virgil</hi> (I know not from what Author) hath a long Story how King <hi>Eoric</hi> above-mentioned made War against King <hi>Edward,</hi> and being routed by him in a great Battel, and returning home, fell so far into the Hatred and Contempt of his Subjects, that they rose up against him, and being then divided into Factions, were forced to submit themselves to King <hi>Edward.</hi> This (if it were true) would give a great light into this dark part of the History of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> of which we have but a very imperfect Account: But since this Relation is found in no other Author except <hi>Polydore</hi>; and besides, expresly contradicting the Testimony of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> a much more Authentick Writer, by whose Account (as well as by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals) it appears that this <hi>Eoric</hi> was dead long before: I think we may justly look upon <hi>Polydore</hi>'s Relation as a mere Fiction, either invented by himself, or else taken from some Modern Author of no great Credit: Therefore I must now warn the Reader concerning this Historian, That though he had the Perusal of a great many Rare Manuscripts, yet since he very seldom cites any Authors, and that we find he sometimes differs from our most Ancient Writers, and is plainly mistaken in divers Relations, we have great reason to refuse his Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, where it is not agreeable with more Authentick Authorities.</p>

               <p>This year also (according to <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Mat.

This is the first time we find any Submission of the King of <hi>Scots</hi>; which whether it amounted to a downright Homage, and to hold that Kingdom of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> may be much questioned, and is absolutely denied by the <hi>Scotish</hi> Historians.</p>

                  <q>This year King <hi>Edward</hi> carried his Army about the end of Autumn, to <hi>Thaelwale,</hi> (that is, <hi>Thaelwalle</hi> in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> and which is supposed to have been so called from its being encompassed at first with a Wall made of Bodies of Trees, called in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue <hi>Thal),</hi> where he ordered that Town to be repaired; and he commanded another part of his Forces, whilst he stayed there, to march out of <hi>Mercia</hi> to <hi>Manigeceaster,</hi> (now <hi>Manchester</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Northumberland</hi>) and order'd it to be rebuilt, and strengthened with a Garison: This year also <hi>Plegmond</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> deceased, and <hi>Reginold</hi> (the <hi>Danish</hi> King) took <hi>Eoferwick</hi> (that is, <hi>York.</hi>)</q>

               </p>
               <p>But this year's actions are placed by <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Mat. Westminster</hi> three years sooner; which shews the Copies they had of these Annals differ'd from those we have, though which of them is the truest, I shall not now take upon me to affirm; but it sufficiently shews, that both these Copies were not written at one and the same time.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And now King <hi>Edward</hi> deceased at <hi>Fearndune</hi> in the Province of the <hi>Mercians</hi> (now called <hi>Farrington</hi> in <hi>Berkshire</hi>);<note place="margin">

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Canterbury</hi> Copy of these Annals, as also <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> place the Death of these two Princes under the foregoing year; and indeed they seem to have been in the right. But this is most certain, that this Prince, who is called <hi>Aethelward</hi> by <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> was his Eldest Son by Queen <hi>Aelfleda</hi> his Wife, the Daughter of Earl <hi>Aethelune,</hi> and being very well instructed in Learning, did much resemble King <hi>Aelfred</hi> his Grandfather as well in Face as Disposition: yet though he survived his Father, he never took upon him the Title of King, because he outlived him so little a time, that he could not be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly <hi>Elected</hi> and Crowned King according to the Law and Custom of Succession in those times.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:93814:242"/>I have nothing more to add to this Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Elder,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxxv.</note> but only the Laws he made, which since it is not specified in what year of his Reign, nor in what Common-Council of the Kingdom they were enacted, I thought best to refer to this place.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the Preface to his Laws he strictly charges and commands his Officers, that as much as in them lies they do Justice according as it stands in the <hi>Judicial</hi> Book (supposed to be some Book of Presidents or Judgments); and without all fear boldly dispense common Right to all men; and that they set and appoint certain days for determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the several Causes depending before them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The first Law is concerning Traffick, and in way of confirmation of the fourth Article of the League made betwixt his Father and the <hi>Danish</hi> King <hi>Guthrun,</hi> ordains, that if a man will sell any thing, he shall have one to vouch and make good the sale; and that no man buy any thing without the Town, unless he have the Portreeve for wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or some other men worthy of Credit; otherwise he shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the Penalty of Contumacy against the King; This Vouching or Warranty shall also proceed from one to another, till it end with him who first sold it: The rest of this Law, containing in what cases the Buyer, and likewise the Demandant, shall find sufficient Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or Oaths of the true buying of the Goods so bought, being long, I refer the Reader to the Law it self.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The second of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws ordains, That whosoever denies another man his Right either in <hi>Bocland</hi> or <hi>Folcland,</hi> demanding it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King's Sheriff, when as he hath no Right in either, shall pay to the King for the first Offence Thirty Shillings, and as much more for the second; and if he offend the third time, then to pay an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty shillings for his Contumacy against the King.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The third adjudges that for one who had forsworn himself, or born false witness, no credit should be given to him for the time to come, but that he be put to <hi>Ordeal,</hi> in all cases where his Oath is required.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The fourth declares, That King <hi>Edward</hi> lying at <hi>Exeter,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting with his <hi>Wise Men</hi> by what means he might best provide for the Publick Peace and Tranquility, it then seemed to them that what he had commanded was too remissly executed; therefore he now required all that will amend and reform these things, and would with him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy common society, that they would prosecute with their utmost ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the same persons as he did both by Sea and Land; and that they would take care not to do wrong or injury to any man. He that doth contrary, let him (as was formerly ordained) pay thirty shillings to the King; and if he offend the second time, as much more; if the third, an hundred and twenty shillings.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The fifth commands, that that <hi>Reeve</hi> or Judge who doth not Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice according to the testimony of such as are summon'd, pay an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty shillings for his Contumacy against the King.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The sixth wills, That if a Servant be accused of Theft, he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended him to his Master, or other of his Friends (if he have any), be Sureties for him that he discharge himself of what is depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against him; and if he have none to interpose on his behalf, those that are concerned may seize his Goods; but if he have neither Goods nor Friends, let him be taken into custody.</q>

                  <q>The eighth Law enjoins that no man knowingly and voluntarily have peace with, or harbour one that is condemned for any Crime; he that acts contrary, and thereby breaks his Oath, and the Faith gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by him and all the people, let him undergo the Mulct prescribed in the <hi>Judiciary</hi> Book; which if he refuse to pay, he is to be deprived of the King's Favour, and all other mens Friendship, and farther for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit all his Estate; and if any afterwards relieve him, let him also incur the Penalty expressed in the said Book; and farther, whosoever shall relieve a Fugitive either in this Countrey, or in the <hi>Eastern</hi> or <hi>Northern</hi> parts of the Kingdom, <hi>(i. e.</hi> in <hi>East-England</hi> and <hi>Northumberland)</hi> let him be punished as by the Articles of Peace is ordained.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The ninth provides, that if one deprived of his liberty for stealing, steal again, so that all his Kindred forsake him, and none will engage for him, he is to be set to servile and hard labour, as opportunity shall offer, and his Kindred shall lose the valuation of his head.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The tenth Law forbids any man to receive another man's Servant without his leave, and that he hath fully satisfied his Master; he that doth otherwise, shall be punished as contumacious against the King.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The eleventh and last commands, That about every fourth Week every Sheriff or Judge hold the <hi>Gemot</hi> or Assembly, and administer Justice to every man, and determine all Causes at the days appointed; if he do otherwise, he is to be punished as was before said.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From all which Laws we may observe, First, That the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning redeeming of all Crimes by Pecuniary Fines was not yet abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, nor in some Ages after; but the strict Laws for vouching of Goods sold, as also against Fugitives and Runaway Servants, were but necessary in such licentious and turbulent times, when it was so very easy for Offenders to pass out of the <hi>English</hi> Territories into those of the <hi>Danes.</hi> You may also here observe the Antiquity and Power of the <hi>County-Court,</hi> which was then held (as now) every Month, but had much more Power anciently than at this day.</p>
               <p>As for the Laws that follow, and which are entituled in Mr. <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard</hi>'s Copy, The Ecclesiastical Laws of <hi>Edward</hi> the Elder, King of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Gutherne</hi> King of the <hi>Danes</hi> in <hi>East-England,</hi> which were first made by the Kings <hi>Alfred</hi> and <hi>Gutherne,</hi> and were now said to be again confirmed by King <hi>Edward</hi> Son to <hi>Alfred,</hi> and the same King <hi>Gutherne,</hi> there must certainly be an Error in the Name of the <hi>Danish</hi> King here mentioned, since it appears by our Annals that <hi>Gutherne</hi> died ten years before King <hi>Alfred</hi>; therefore since we do not find any other <hi>Danish</hi> King of this Name, we may rather suppose that these Laws were made by King <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Eoric</hi> the <hi>Danish</hi> King who succeeded <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne</hi> in that Kingdom; but be it as it will, I shall not trouble the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with their Recital, since they relate chiefly to Ecclesiastical Affairs, and are in most points but a Repetition of those things which had been before agreed upon by King <hi>Alfred</hi> and King <hi>Gutherne</hi> some years before.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> dying, after four and twenty years Reign, was buried in the Monastery at <hi>Winchester,</hi> which his Father had founded, leaving by his Testament <hi>Athelstan</hi> his Eldest Son to succeed him; who (as <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and most other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relate) was not born of the Queen, but of one <hi>Egwinna</hi> a Lady,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:93814:243"/>
the Daughter of a Nobleman; whose Name,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxxv.</note> though <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> does not tell us, because he says he had not found it in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, yet the Chronicle ascribed to Abbot <hi>Bromton</hi> tells us a long and improbable Story of the getting and Birth of this Prince; which being no where else to be found, as I know of, I shall here give you: That in the Reign of King <hi>Aelfred,</hi> when his Son <hi>Edward</hi> was young, there was in a Village of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> the Daughter of a certain Shephard, called <hi>Egwinna,</hi> who falling asleep, dreamed that the Moon shone out of her Womb so bright, that all <hi>England</hi> was enlighten'd by its Splendor: This Dream she told to a Grave Matron, that had been Nurse to several of the King's Children: Upon this she takes her into her house, and educates her as carefully as if she had been her own Daughter, instructing her so to demean her self, as might become a Person both of Birth and Breeding. In process of time it happen'd, that Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> the King's Eldest Son, passing upon some occasion through this Town, thought himself obliged in Honour and Good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to visit his Nurse; by which means he got sight of this Maid, and she being exceeding beautiful, fell passionately in love with her, and by his violent Importunity he got her Consent to lye with him, and by one Night's Lodging she proved with Child, and being afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of a Son, in respect to the Mother's Dream the Father gave him the Name of <hi>Athelstan,</hi> which signifies, <hi>The most Noble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this Story be true, that he married this Woman without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of his Father, and kept the Marriage private, the Authors above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited had good cause to suppose her to have been rather his Concubine than his Queen; though there be also other Historians, who make her to have been his Lawful Wife: But thus much is more certain, That King <hi>Edward</hi> had Prince <hi>Ethelward</hi> above-mentioned, by his Wife <hi>Aelfleda</hi> the Daughter of Earl <hi>Aethelem,</hi> as also another Son, called <hi>Edwin,</hi> of the manner of whose Death <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> says he cannot certainly tell us; but gives us an exact account of what became of all the rest of his Children: He had also by her six Daughters, <hi>viz. Edelfleda, Edgiva, Ethelhilda, Ethilda, Edgitha,</hi> and <hi>Elgiva</hi>; of whom, the first and third vowed their Virginity to God, and both of them lye buried by their Mother in the Monastery of <hi>Winchester</hi>; as for <hi>Edgiva,</hi> her Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed her upon <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France</hi>; and for <hi>Ethilda,</hi> her Brother King <hi>Athelstan</hi> bestowed her in Marriage upon <hi>Hugo,</hi> a King or Prince of the <hi>French</hi>; and <hi>Edgitha</hi> and <hi>Elgiva</hi> their Brother sent to <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Emperor, the Second of which he married to <hi>Otho</hi> his Son, and the Elder to a certain Duke near the <hi>Alpes.</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> also begot of his Third Wife <hi>Edgiva, Edmund</hi> and <hi>Edred,</hi> who both reigned successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after their Brother King <hi>Athelstan,</hi> as also two other Daughters, <hi>Ead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burga</hi> and <hi>Edgiva</hi>; the former became a Nun, but the latter being a great Beauty, was bestowed in Marriage by her Brother <hi>Athelstan</hi> on <hi>Lewis</hi> Prince or Duke of <hi>Aquitain:</hi> But King <hi>Edward</hi> had so well bred all his said Daughters from their Infancy, that they were wont all of them to bestow their leisure time upon good Letters, and after that were wont to exercise both their Distaff and the Needle; and in this manner they passed the first years of their Virginity: Likewise his Sons were so inured to Learning, that not being rude and ignorant in Knowledge, they became (like <hi>Plato</hi>'s Philosophers) fit to Govern the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; as our Author handsomly expresses it.</p>

                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxxv.</note>This King seems by his History to have been a Prince of great Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Humility, as well as Courage; which appears by this Story; but tho it be not found in any of our Historians, is yet related by <hi>Walter Mape</hi> in his <hi>Nugis Curialium</hi> in Manuscript, as follows; That when K. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Elder came to <hi>Austelin,</hi> (I suppose, that which we now call <hi>Aust,</hi> where is a Ferry to pass out of <hi>Somersetshire</hi> into <hi>Wales) Lewelyn</hi> Prince of <hi>North-Wales</hi> came to <hi>Bethesley</hi> about a Treaty of Peace, he refused first to cross the <hi>Severne</hi>; but when King <hi>Edward</hi> heard it, he took Boat and rowed towards him; but the Prince (being then by the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-side) when he saw him, and knew who he was, he cast off the Rich Robe he then had on (which he had provided for that meeting), and entring the River breast-high, taking hold of the end of the Boat, submissively said, <hi>Most Sage King, thy Humility hath overcome my Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and thy Wisdom triumph'd over my Folly: Come, pray Sir, get upon this Neck, which I (like a Fool as I am) have lifted up against thee; and thus enter that Land which thy benign Clemency hath made this day thine own:</hi> So taking the King upon his Shoulders, and setting him on shore, he made him to sit down upon his own Royal Robe, and putting his own hands between the King's; there did him Homage.</p>
               <p>But this Circumstance only serves to bring all the rest of this Story into question; for it is certain this Ceremony of doing Homage was not in use till after the coming in of the <hi>Normans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, the <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicles mention no such thing, nor can I find any Prince either of <hi>North</hi> or <hi>South Wales,</hi> called <hi>Lewelyn</hi> at that time, till <hi>Anno</hi> 1015, in the Reign of King <hi>Cnute,</hi> above a hundred year after the death of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Elder; but perhaps the Story may be true, being told by Tradition, though the Name of the Prince may be mistaken; and <hi>Lewelyn</hi> put instead of <hi>Howel,</hi> who was now King of <hi>South-Wales,</hi> and in whose Territories this Action must have happen'd.</p>
               <p>But whether this Relation be true or false, we may from it draw this Observation, That it is not always Wisdom in Princes to insist too nicely upon Circumstances, especially in Ceremony, but that sometimes to recede from them, may tend to the greater Advantage of that Prince that doth it.</p>

               <head>King ATHELSTAN.</head>
               <p>THE same year, not long after King <hi>Edward</hi>'s decease,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxxv.</note> the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals tell us, <q>That <hi>Aethelstan</hi> was elected King by the <hi>Mercians,</hi> and afterwards Crowned at <hi>Kingstune</hi> upon <hi>Thames</hi> (being then a Royal Town).</q> Note, He was crowned in the midst of the Town upon a Scaffold built on purpose, whereon the Ceremony of the Coronation was performed in the open view of all men, by <hi>Athelm</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Also St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> was born, and <hi>Wulfhelme</hi> was consecrated Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> upon the Death of <hi>Athelm.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>From whence you may observe, the <hi>Mercians</hi> had not yet lost their Ancient Right of chusing their own King; and no doubt but the <hi>West-Saxons</hi> did so likewise, though it be not particularly express'd in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals: For an Ancient Manuscript Chronicle in the * <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library, says only, <hi>Electus est in Regem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And you may also hence observe, That the King's <hi>Consecration</hi> or <hi>Coronation</hi> is placed as a different action from his <hi>Election</hi>; as it is also in the Author last cited, and in <hi>H. Huntington,</hi> who therein follow our Annals, and say expresly, That he was <hi>Elected.</hi> But it seems before his Election, one <hi>Alfred,</hi> with some factious men of his Party, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to hinder King <hi>Athelstan</hi>'s coming to the Crown, because he was begot on a Concubine; which, says <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> if it were true (as he seems there to doubt), yet had he nothing else ignoble in him, for he surpassed all his Predecessors as well in his Devotion as his Victories: So much better is it (as he well observes) to excel in good Qualities, than in his Ancestors, the former only being truly a man's own.</p>
               <p>Hither we may also refer what the same Author tells us concerning this <hi>Alfred</hi> above-mentioned, out of the Preface to King <hi>Athelstan</hi>'s Charter, whereby he confers the Lands once belonging to this <hi>Alfred</hi> upon the Church of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> for the Souls of his Cousins, <hi>Ethelred, Edwin,</hi> and <hi>Ethelwin,</hi> there buried: And to testify to the world, that he gave what was his own, he there at large relates the whole Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy which <hi>Alfred</hi> had laid, together with his Complices, to seize him in the City of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and to put out his Eyes; but the Plot being happily discovered, and <hi>Alfred</hi> denying it, he was sent to <hi>Rome</hi> there to purge himself before Pope <hi>John</hi>; where coming to take his Oath at the Altar of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> he fell down, and being carried by his Servants into the <hi>English</hi> School, there died the third night after: but, it seems, the <hi>Pope</hi> would not dispose of his Body, till he had sent to ask King <hi>Athelstan</hi>'s Judgment what should be done with it; when by the Advice and at the Request of the Chief Men, the King assented that it should (though unworthy of that Honour) be laid among the Bodies of other Christians; but his whole Estate was adjudged confiscated for so black a Treason.</p>

                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxxv.</note>But one of the first things this King performed after his coming to the Crown (as we find in <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi>) was his bestowing his Sister <hi>Edgitha</hi> in Marriage to <hi>Sihtric</hi> the <hi>Danish</hi> King of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who desired the Alliance of King <hi>Athelstan</hi>; And, as <hi>Matthew Westminster</hi> relates, this Prince professing himself a Christian, was a little before his Marriage baptized; but did not long continue so, for he relapsed again to his former Paganism. And the next year,</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxxvi.</note>According to <hi>Florence,</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> he deceased; after whose death the Lady above-mentioned retiring to her Brother King <hi>Athelstan,</hi> became a Nun at <hi>Pollesworth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can I here omit the Falshood of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Historians, who out of spight to King <hi>Athelstan</hi>'s Memory, make <hi>Sihtric</hi> to have been poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd by this Lady, whom they call <hi>Beatrix,</hi> and that at the Instigation of her Brother King <hi>Athelstan</hi>; whereas her Name was not <hi>Beatrix,</hi> but <hi>Edgitha,</hi> or <hi>Orgiva</hi>; and was a Woman of as great Reputation for her Sanctity, as the King her Brother was for his Valour and other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Virtues, which render'd him above the putting his Sister upon so base an Action.</p>
               <p>But before I dismiss this Relation, I cannot omit what <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford</hi> adds concerning this King <hi>Sihtric</hi>; whom he calls <hi>Sictric</hi>; viz. That upon this Marriage with King <hi>Athelstan</hi>'s Sister, he advanced him to the Title of King, that his Sister might not stoop so low as to that of Countess; and that <hi>Sictric</hi> then had for his Kingdom all the Countrey from the River <hi>Theys,</hi> as far as <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> from which time the <hi>Danes</hi> began to settle in those parts, who before rambled about over all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; to which Settlement, as also to a fresh accession of more, the <hi>Northerly</hi> Situation of that Countrey, lying over-against <hi>Denmark,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed very much, as this Author well observes.</p>
               <p>This year (according to <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham) Sihtric</hi> King of the <hi>Northumbers</hi> departed this life; so that it seems that this King survived his Marriage but a small time.</p>
               <p>Also the same year (according to <hi>Florence) Hugh,</hi> the Son of <hi>Robert</hi> King of the <hi>French,</hi> married King <hi>Athelstan</hi>'s Sister; and after the death of King <hi>Sihtric, Guthfrith</hi> his Son succeeded him, though but for a little while; for the year following our Annals tell us,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno. Dom.</hi> Dccccxxvii.</note>That King <hi>Aethelstan</hi> expelled the said <hi>Guthfryth</hi> King of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> and added his Dominions to his own: And the same year <hi>Wulfhelm</hi> the Archbishop went to <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>From which Conquest of the Kingdom of <hi>Northumberland</hi> we may observe, That as King <hi>Edward</hi> had before conquered the <hi>Danes</hi> of <hi>East-England,</hi> and had also added <hi>Mercia</hi> to his own Kingdom; so King <hi>Athelstan,</hi> by the Expulsion of King <hi>Guthfrith</hi> (who was also of the <hi>Danish</hi> Race) became the first King that ruled all <hi>England,</hi> without any King under him.</p>
               <p>Of this Prince also <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Wallingford</hi> relates, That being a Young Man he was stirred up to this Rebellion by the suggestion of the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> who told him that their Countrey had always enjoyed a King of their own, without being Tributary to the <hi>Southern English:</hi> And indeed, from the first arrival of the <hi>English Saxons,</hi> they had been never subject to any of the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Kings, except King <hi>Athelstan</hi>: Therefore this <hi>Guithfrith,</hi> or <hi>Gutred,</hi> moved by these instigations, took upon him the Name of King, without King <hi>Athelstan</hi>'s consent, and cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:93814:245"/>
out the Garisons, seized all the Forts and Castles of that Country,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno.

               <p>And therefore <hi>Alfred</hi> of <hi>Beverly,</hi> an Ancient Author still in Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script, very well observes of this Prince, That by subduing the <hi>Scots, Welsh,</hi> and all the Kings of <hi>Britain,</hi> he justly deserved the Title of the first Monarch; though his Modesty was so great, that he never gave himself that Title, but left it to his Brother <hi>Edred</hi> to take, as shall be shewn in his Reign.</p>

                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxxxiii.</note> that this Bishop <hi>Frithelstan</hi> did before his death ordain Bishop <hi>Byrnstan</hi> in his room; and if so, he resigned the Bishoprick of <hi>Winchester</hi> to him, and lived only one year after it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Also the same year (according to our Annals) <hi>Edwin Aetheling</hi> was drowned.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Edwin</hi> here mentioned in our Annals, was Brother to King <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan,</hi> whose Death being the greatest Blot of this King's Reign, divers Authors have concealed it; but notwithstanding, it is thus given us by <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and the Chronicle called Abbot <hi>Bromton</hi>'s; <hi>Alfred</hi> above-mentioned having conspired against King <hi>Athelstan,</hi> (as you have already heard) had several Complices in that Treason; and there were not wanting some Court Sycophants to accuse Prince <hi>Edwin</hi> of being in that Plot, for he was the eldest Legitimate Son then living of King <hi>Edward</hi> by his Lawful Wife; since therefore the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of a Rival usually overpowers all Obligations both of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Nature, though <hi>Edwin</hi> both by Word of Mouth, and by Oaths and Imprecations, protested his Innocence; yet all this would not prevail against these Court-Whisperers, who affirmed that if he were only banished, he would be commiserated by Foreign Princes, and still more endanger the King's safety; whereupon such a way was found out, that under the Notion of Banishment he might with the least appearance of Cruelty be dispatch'd: In short, an old rotten Vessel was provided, and only the Prince and his Esquire were put into it, without any Pilot or other body to steer or manage it; and thus for some time they weather'd it at Sea; but the Young Prince being brought up tenderly, and not used to hardship, despairing of his Life, cast himself headlong out of the Vessel, and so perished in the Ocean; whilst his Servant being more couragious, was resolved to save himself if he could; and meeting with better fortune, was driven on shore at a place called <hi>Whitsand,</hi> on the Coast of <hi>Picardy,</hi> not far from <hi>Dover.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fact was not long done, before <hi>Athelstan</hi> sorely repented of it; which he is said by a Seven Years Penance to have testified to the world, as also by the Punishment of him who was the principal Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this <hi>Fratricide,</hi> and had whispered this Jealousy into his Breast,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:93814:246"/>
who being his Cup-bearer,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno. Dom.</hi> Dccccxxxiii.</note> as he was going to present a Cup of Drink to him, one of his Feet slipped; but by the Nimbleness of the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering himself, he said, <hi>Thus one Brother helps another</hi>; which the King hearing, and sadly calling to mind how little he himself had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted his Brother, oppressed by the Calumnies of this Parasite, caused him to be put to death.</p>
               <p>This is the Tale told by <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and the other Author; the latter of whom delivers it as a certain Truth, whilst the former tells it only as an old Story, sung in certain Ballads, and of which he himself doubted the Truth. But <hi>Buchanan</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi> Historian (I suppose out of malice to this King's Memory for routing his Countreymen) makes King <hi>Athelstan</hi> not only to have procured the Death of his Brother <hi>Edwin,</hi> but also of his Father King <hi>Edward,</hi> whom he therefore fancies to have been called <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Martyr</hi>; and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this neither, he adds, that he put his Brother <hi>Edred</hi> to death also: Yet certainly there can scarce be more Mistakes committed in so few Lines than he has been guilty of in these; for in the first place it is agreed by all our Historians, that King <hi>Edward</hi> died a Natural Death; and as for him whom he calls the <hi>Martyr,</hi> he was the Son of King <hi>Edgar</hi>; nor did he begin to reign till above an hundred and fifty years after, as shall be shewn when we come to his Reign.</p>
               <p>But as for what <hi>Buchanan</hi> objects against some of our later Historians, for making <hi>Athelstan</hi> to be King of all <hi>Britain,</hi> and to have restored <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> to his Kingdom, and to have forced him to do him Homage for it; we must confess, that <hi>Buchanan</hi> is so far in the right, that neither our <hi>Saxon Annals,</hi> nor <hi>Marianus Scotus,</hi> nor <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> mention any thing of it, though they all do relate the great Victory which King <hi>Athelstan</hi> obtain'd over the <hi>Scots,</hi> but yet are wholly silent either about his driving of the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or of causing him to do him Homage for restoring him to it. This is to shew, that I would not be partial to the Historians of our own Countrey, as if they could not also be sometimes guilty of great Errors;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxxxiv.</note> and therefore I thought good to take notice of it here.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This year (as our Annals relate) King <hi>Athelstan</hi> made an Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into <hi>Scotland</hi> with a great Army by Land, as also with a considerable Fleet by Sea, and laid wast great part of that Kingdom. The same year also Bishop <hi>Byrnstan</hi> deceased at <hi>Winchester,</hi> on the Feast of <hi>All Saints.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But as for the Causes of this War made by King <hi>Athelstan</hi> against <hi>Scotland,</hi> since not only our Annals but many of our other Authors are silent in it, we must supply that defect from <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and <hi>Roger Hoveden,</hi> and the Chronicles of <hi>Mailrosse,</hi> who relate, that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laf</hi> the Son of <hi>Sihtric</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> having fled into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the late King <hi>Godefrid,</hi> his Brother, into <hi>Scotland,</hi> King <hi>Ath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lstan</hi> sent Ambassadors to <hi>Constantine</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> demanding the Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to be given up to him, or else upon his Refusal denouncing a speedy War against him, which War indeed he made; for marching into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with a great Army both by Sea and Land, he drove his Enemies before him as far as <hi>Dunfeodor</hi> and <hi>Wertermore,</hi> and by Sea as far as <hi>Cathness</hi>; but <hi>Malmesbury</hi> affirms, that they not daring in any thing to displease him, went to a place called <hi>Dacor</hi> (or <hi>Dacre</hi>) in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> where each surrender'd up himself and all his into the hands of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> King, who was Godfather to the Son of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and now or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:93814:246"/>
him to be baptized in testimony of that Accord;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxxxiv.</note> whom also (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with great Presents) he left as a Hostage with the King; and so Peace being thus happily concluded, he returned home into his own Countrey. But the <hi>Scotish</hi> Historians do not mention this Invasion at all, nor will allow King <hi>Constantine</hi> to have had any Son: And indeed it seems improbable, that if <hi>Constantine</hi> had now given his Son to King <hi>Athelstan</hi> as a Hostage, he would have dar'd to renew the War again so soon after this Agreement. But for all this, <hi>Godefrid</hi> escaped while they were preparing for the Journey, and travelling with one <hi>Turfrid</hi> into several parts of the Countrey, at length got some men together, and laid Siege to <hi>York,</hi> the Inhabitants of which they tempted both by fair and foul means to let them in; but not being able to prevail with 'em, they went their ways, and were both taken shortly after, and shut up in a Castle; from whence making their escape by deluding their Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Turfrid</hi> not long after was shipwreck'd at Sea, and became a Prey to the Fish; but <hi>Godefrid</hi> endured much more misery both by Sea and Land, and at last came as a Suppliant to the King's Court, who kindly received him: but after he had been profusely feasted for four days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he got away again to his Ships, and then returned to his old trade of Piracy. In the mean time <hi>Athelstan</hi> demolished a Castle which the <hi>Danes</hi> had fortified at <hi>York,</hi> that so they might not shelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves any more there; and the large Booty he found in it, he divided amongst his Soldiers, to every one a share: For so Worthy and Liberal was this Prince, that he never sought to hoard up Money for himself, but bestowed whatever he got, either upon those Servants he found faithful to him, or else upon Monasteries: No wonder then if he won the hearts of all the Monks, who were the only Historians of those times.</p>
               <p>Now also (as <hi>Florence</hi> relates) <hi>Wulfhelm</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> deceasing, <hi>Odo</hi> Bishop of <hi>Wells</hi> succeeded him.</p>
               <p>This Man was of a <hi>Danish</hi> Race, whose Parents had come over hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Reign; but their Son had been first a Soldier under him, and then turning Priest, was at last by King <hi>Athelstan</hi>'s Recommendation made a Bishop; but having never been a Monk, and none but Monks having been hitherto made Archbishops of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he for a long time refused it; till at last he was persuaded to go over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France,</hi> and there taking upon him the Habit of a Monk, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home, was immediately consecrated Archbishop. This Man was a Prelate of great Sanctity according to those times, and a severe Exactor of Ecclesiastical Discipline, as you will find hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This year also (according to the Annals) Bishop <hi>Byrnstan</hi> above-mentioned deceased at <hi>Winchester.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But to proceed with our Annals; the Success of this Fight was, <q>That the <hi>English-Saxons</hi> towards the latter end of the day utterly rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and put to flight the Enemies Forces, and pursued them as long as day-light lasted; so that in that place there fell no less than five Kings, besides seven other Commanders on <hi>Anlaf</hi>'s side, (not reckoning those of the Naval Forces, and the <hi>Scots</hi> Fleet, who were kill'd without number); so that <hi>Anlaf</hi> was forced to save his Life by going on board his Ships with a small Company; as also one <hi>Froda</hi> by flight returned into his own Countrey.]</q> This <hi>Froda</hi> was (it seems) some <hi>Norman</hi> or <hi>Danish</hi> Commander, who came to assist <hi>Anlaf.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>Neither could King <hi>Constantine</hi> brag much of the success of this Fight among his Relations, for they most of them fell that day in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, the King leaving his Son dead upon the Spot behind him, having received many Wounds.

               <p>So far you have from the <hi>Peterburgh</hi> Copy of these Annals; but that in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library says no more, than that <q>This year King <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan</hi> and King <hi>Eadmund</hi> his Brother led their Army to <hi>Brunanburgh,</hi> and there fighting with <hi>Anlaf,</hi> by the help of Christ obtained the Victory.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Constantine</hi> King of the <hi>Scots</hi> being exasperated by the late Invasion made in his Kingdom, joined with <hi>Anlaf</hi> the Son of <hi>Sihtric</hi> (whom <hi>Florence</hi> more probably supposes to have been not this <hi>Sihtric,</hi> but some other of his name, who was King of <hi>Ireland</hi> and the Isles adjacent, and had married the Daughter of King <hi>Constantine)</hi> who also drew in <hi>Eugenius</hi> Prince of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> with great Forces which he had raised out of several Countries, to their Assistance; and after near four years

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxxxviii.</note> and passed through the Countrey to a place called <hi>Brunanburgh,</hi> or <hi>Bruneford; Athelstan</hi> all this time feigning a Retreat, on purpose that he might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain some better advantage against them, as some write; or, as others, that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eing fearful to grapple with him; <hi>Anlaf</hi> perceiving with whom he had to do, puts off his Royal Habit, and becomes a Spy upon him in the Disguise of a Musician, attending with an Harp in his Hand at <hi>Athelstan</hi>'s Tent; by which means he was easily admitted into the King's Presence, diverting them by his Musick, till such time as they having eaten and drank sufficiently, they began to debate seriously about the Work they had in hand; and he all the while made what Observation he could; at last, when he had received his Reward, and was commanded out of the Tent, he scorning to carry the Money away with him, hid it in the Earth, which a certain Soldier who had formerly served him, taking notice of, thereby came to know him, and after he was gone, acquainted the King who he was; but being blamed for not giving him more timely notice, the Soldier excused it, as having formerly taken a Military Oath in <hi>Anlaf</hi>'s Service; affirming, that had he betrayed <hi>Anlaf,</hi> he himself to whom now he was in the same Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might have expected no better Fidelity; but however, he advised King <hi>Athelstan</hi> to remove his Tent into another place: This Advice was looked upon as good and wholsome, and indeed, how seasonable it proved, very shortly appeared; for a certain Bishop coming to the Camp that night, pitched his Tent in the same place; when <hi>Anlaf,</hi> with a design to destroy the King, assaulted that part of the Camp, being ignorant of what had passed, and easily killed the Bishop with all his Followers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ingulph</hi> (who seems more exact than any other Historian in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) writes, That <hi>Anlaf,</hi> tho he had brought with him an infinite multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>Danes, Norwegians, Scots,</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> yet either out of Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or Craft familiar to his Nation, chose rather by night to surprize his Enemy, than fairly to give him Battel in the open field, and by day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; so he fell suddenly upon the <hi>English,</hi> and kill'd a Bishop who was come but the Evening before to the Camp, which causing a great Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and Tumult, the King, 'tho a Mile off, took the Alarm with his whole Army, who putting themselves into such order as the Surprize would permit, by break of day came up to the Enemy, where finding them tir'd and disorder'd by their late March for want of sleep, King <hi>Athelstan</hi> in Person leading on the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> fell upon <hi>Anlaf</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, whilst <hi>Turketul</hi> his Kinsman and Chancellor, (who had the Conduct of the <hi>Londoners</hi>) and the <hi>Mercians,</hi> assaulted <hi>Constantine</hi> the <hi>Scotish</hi> King; their Missil Weapons being quickly spent, they came to hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blows, and to fight it out with Sword and Buckler, where many of them lost their Lives, and the Carkasses of mean persons lay confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly together with the slain Bodies of Princes, Death making no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction. The Dispute continuing very long and violent by reason the multitude of Enemies was so great, <hi>Turketul</hi> took with him some of the <hi>Londoners</hi> whom he knew to be most valiant, and a Captain of the <hi>Worcestershire</hi>-men, called <hi>Singin,</hi> one of approved Courage, who being taller than the rest, and of well compacted Limbs, and the stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of all those <hi>London</hi> Heroes that accompanied him; then <hi>Turketul</hi> rushing into the very midst of his Enemies, and laying vigorously
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:93814:249"/>
about him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxxxviii.</note> hewed down whole ranks of men on both sides of him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that he passed through whole Troops of <hi>Orcadians</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> bearing a Wood of Arrows on his Breast-plate, and making his way through whole Companies of <hi>Cumbrians</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> he at length reached <hi>Constantine</hi> himself, whom he dismounted, and would have taken alive; but the <hi>Scots</hi> were so concerned for their King, that they had a very smart Conflict about him, and many of them pressing upon the few <hi>English</hi> that followed him, and all of them aiming chiefly at <hi>Turketul,</hi> he began to repent of his Rashness, seeing no means either of escaping himself, or getting off his Prisoner; when on the sudden Captain <hi>Singin</hi> coming in afresh to his Rescue, killed King <hi>Constantine:</hi> And now their King being slain, the <hi>Scots</hi> were so discouraged, that they soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired; and the Report of their Discomfiture flying about the Army, <hi>Anlaf</hi> and all his Followers ran away, after an incredible Slaughter of <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> upon the place.</p>
               <p>So much <hi>Ingulph</hi> relates, for the greater Honour of this <hi>Turketul,</hi> the Chancellor, who was afterwards Abbot of the Abby of <hi>Croyland,</hi> and his Predecessor in the Government of that Monastery, where he left a large Memorial of his Secular Employments. And the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor farther adds, that besides <hi>Constantine,</hi> five other Kings were there slain, twelve Earls, and an infinite number of Common Soldiers.</p>
               <p>But though <hi>Ingulph</hi> and <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> do thus confidently relate <hi>Constantine</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> to have been slain in this Battel, yet all the <hi>Scotch</hi> Historians, as well as our own Annals asserting the contrary, it is not to be insisted on as true, and therefore I shall pass it by; yet grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was not kill'd in that Battel, <hi>John Fordon</hi> and <hi>Buchanan</hi> do both agree, that he became not long after dead to the world; for being quite tired out with his late ill success, he professed himself a Monk amongst the <hi>Culdees</hi> of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> (an Order of Monks so called) of whom this King became Abbot. But the <hi>Scotch</hi> Historians do all confess the greatness of the Victory on the <hi>English,</hi> and the great Loss on their own side; acknowledging the Fall of <hi>Eugenius</hi> King of <hi>Deira,</hi> (whom our Historians call King of <hi>Cumberland</hi>), but will not own King <hi>Constantine</hi> to have been so much as present at this fight, but only <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colme</hi> his Cousin, who upon his retiring into a Monastery, was declared King in his room: Yet <hi>Hector Boethius,</hi> and <hi>Buchanan,</hi> to lessen this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory as much as they can, do suppose, (though I do not know from what Authority, since <hi>Fordon</hi> mentions no such thing) <q>That the <hi>English</hi> under King <hi>Athelstan</hi> being much weaker in Forces, he was fain to supply that by Cunning and Artifice; and having strengthen'd his Army by fresh Supplies, he commanded them at the first Onset to make as if they fled, and when they found the Enemy had broken their Ranks, to turn again on their Pursuers; which being punctually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by King <hi>Athelstan</hi>'s Army, the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> supposing themselves to be <hi>Victors,</hi> immediately fell to spoiling the Enemies Camp; and thereupon a Sign being given by King <hi>Athelstan,</hi> they fell upon the Enemy, now laden with Prey, and destroyed them like so many Sheep, insomuch that in this Fight most of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity were slain, whilst they rather chose to dye than to survive the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy of having deserted their Companions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But this sounds very Romantick, as does also his Relation of the Battel, which neither agrees with the plain downright way of fighting
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:93814:249"/>
used in that age, nor with the Stout and Martial Genius of this King:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxxxviii.</note> But let the Manner of gaining the Victory be as it will, they all agree upon the Effect of it; That King <hi>Athelstan</hi> (his Enemies being asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd with so great a loss) took <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmorland</hi> from the <hi>Scots,</hi> and recovered <hi>Northumberland</hi> from the <hi>Danes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But since the <hi>Monks</hi> will scarce let so great a Victory pass without a Miracle, I cannot forbear relating what <hi>Fordun,</hi> and the Chronicle ascribed to Abbot <hi>Bromton,</hi> have related from a certain Legend of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Beverly; viz.</hi> That King <hi>Athelstan</hi> going to make War against the <hi>Scots,</hi> and by the way paying a Visit to the Tomb of that Saint, there pawn'd his Knife at the Altar, promising to redeem it at his return; but when they had thus fought against the <hi>Scots,</hi> he begged of God a Sign, whereby it might appear to future Ages, that they were justly vanquished by the <hi>English</hi>; and thereupon the King striking a certain Rock with his Sword near the Castle of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> he made a Gap in it an Ell deep; this Miracle is so gross, that even <hi>John Fordon</hi> himself ridicules it. But it seems King <hi>Athelstan</hi> made good his Promise, and upon his return with Victory, enrich'd the Church of St. <hi>John</hi> with great Possessions; and so, I suppose, got his Knife again.</p>
               <p>As for the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her Miracle related also by the Monks, of King <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan</hi>'s Sword being lost out of the Scabbard just when he was ready to fight, and another was by Miracle put in the place, at the Prayers of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Odo</hi>; which Sword they pretend was kept in the King's Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury; it is no less a Wonder than the former; and one such as these is enough at one time.</p>
               <p>This year (according to <hi>Florence</hi>) King <hi>Athelstan</hi> founded the Abby of <hi>Middleton</hi> in <hi>Dorsetshire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxl.</note> to expiate the Death of his Brother Prince <hi>Edwin,</hi> whom through false suggestions he had destroy'd, (as you have already heard).</p>
               <p>About this time also (according to the <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicle) <hi>Howel Dha.</hi> Prince of <hi>South-Wales</hi> and <hi>Powis,</hi> after the death of <hi>Edwal Voel,</hi> his Cousin, Prince of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> took upon him the Government of all <hi>Wales,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Edwal</hi> being then in Minority. This <hi>Howel</hi> made that Excellent Body of Laws that go under his Name, and which you may find in Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi>'s first Volume of Councils: This Prince, for his Discreet and Just Government, not only made himself highly beloved, but also rendred his Memory very glorious to After-Ages.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But it seems King <hi>Athelstan</hi> did not long survive this Victory; for (as our Annals relate) he deceased this year on the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Kal. Novemb.</hi> just Forty years after the death of King <hi>Alfred</hi> his Grandfather,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxli.</note> having reigned Fourteen Years and Ten Months:]</q> But there is certainly an Error in this Account; for either this King must have reigned a year less, or else the King his Father must have died a year sooner than our Annals allow him; and perhaps with greater Certainty; for <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> places his Death in <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 924.</p>
               <p>Nor can we before we finish this King's Life, omit taking notice, That <hi>Bromton</hi>'s Chronicle and other Modern Writers do place the long Story of the <hi>Danes</hi> invading <hi>England</hi> in this King's Reign; and that one <hi>Guy</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> returning home by chance from the <hi>Holy Land</hi> in the Habit of a Pilgrim, just when King <hi>Athelstan</hi> was in great distress for a Champion to fight with one <hi>Colebrand</hi> a monstrous <hi>Danish</hi>
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:93814:250"/>
Gyant,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxli.</note> whom the King of the <hi>Danes</hi> had set up to fight with any Champion the <hi>English</hi> King should bring into the field; that Earl <hi>Guy</hi> accepted this Challenge, and without being known to any man but the King, fought the Gyant near <hi>Winchester,</hi> and killing him, the <hi>Danes</hi> yielded the Victory; whilst Earl <hi>Guy</hi> privately retired to a Hermitage near <hi>Warwick,</hi> and there living a Hermit's life, ended his days.</p>
               <p>But though <hi>John Rouse</hi> in his Manuscript Treatise <hi>de Regibus Anglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> places this Action under <hi>Anno</hi> 926, as soon as ever King <hi>Athelstan</hi> came to the Crown; and that <hi>Tho. Rudburne</hi> in his History of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> says, That this Gyant's Sword being kept in the Treasury of the Abby of <hi>Winchester,</hi> was shewn in his time; yet since neither the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals, nor any other Ancient Historian, mention any Invasion of the <hi>Danes</hi> in this King's Reign, nor any thing of such a Combat, it ought to be looked upon as a <hi>Monkish</hi> Tale, only fit for Ballads and Children.</p>
               <p>But since the Monks are very profuse in the Praises of this Prince, I will give you <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi>'s Character of him; That as for his Person, he did not exceed the ordinary Stature, being of a slender Body; his Hair (as he had seen by his Reliques) was Yellow; that as for his Natural Temper and Disposition, he was always kind to <hi>God's Servants (i. e.</hi> the Monks), for there was scarce a Monastery in <hi>England,</hi> but what had been adorned by him with Buildings, Books, or Reliques. And though he was grave and serious amongst his Nobles, yet was he affable to the Inferior sort, often laying aside the Majesty of a King, to converse the more freely with ordinary men. This made him as much admired by his Subjects for his Humility, as he was fear'd by his Enemies and Rebels for his Invincible Courage and Constancy.</p>
               <p>An Eminent Instance of this was, in that he compell'd the Kings of <hi>North-Wales</hi> (for some time standing out) to meet him at <hi>Hereford,</hi> and submit themselves to him: I wish our Author had told us the Year when it was done, since our Annals have wholly omitted it; for tho <hi>Ran. Hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> in his <hi>Polychronicon</hi> has put it under <hi>Anno</hi> 937; and also relates from <hi>Alfred</hi> of <hi>Beverly,</hi> that this King restored both <hi>Constantine</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Hoel</hi> King of the <hi>Britains,</hi> to their Kingdoms; saying, <hi>It was more glorious to make a King, than to be one</hi>; yet I do not see any Authority for it: But this is agreed upon by all, That <hi>Athelstan</hi> did about that time enter <hi>Wales</hi> with a powerful Army, and effected what no King had ever presumed to think of before; for he imposed a Yearly Tribute upon those Kings, of Twenty Pounds in Gold, and Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds in Silver, and Twenty five thousand Head of Cattel. Yet the Laws of <hi>Howel Dha</hi> appointed the King of <hi>Aberfraw</hi> to pay yearly to the King of <hi>London,</hi> no more than Sixty six Pounds for a Tribute, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Hawks and Hounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Wallingford</hi> makes this King the first who reduced all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> into one Monarchy, by his Conquest of <hi>Northumberland, Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi>; yet that he was in his own nature a Lover of Peace; and whatever he had heard from his Grandfather, or observed in his Father, he put in practice, being Just in his Judgments, and by a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py conjunction of many Virtues, so beloved by all men, that to this day Fame, which is wont to be too severe to the Faults of Great Men, can relate nothing to his prejudice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> also gives us a short Account of his Life and Actions from his very Childhood; wherein he tells us, That this Prince
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:93814:250"/>
when he was but a Youth,<note place="margin">

               <p>Nor does he only relate him to have been Valiant, but also compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently Learned, as he had been informed from a certain old Author he had seen, who compared him to <hi>Tully</hi> for Eloquence; though (as he rightly observes) the Custom of that Age might very well dispense with that Talent; and perhaps a too great Affection to King <hi>Athelstan,</hi> then living, might excuse this Author's over-large Commendations.</p>
               <p>But this must be acknowledged, that all <hi>Europe</hi> then spoke highly in his Praise, and extoll'd his Valour to the Skies; Neighbouring Kings thinking themselves happy if they could purchase his Friendship either by his Alliance, or their Presents. <hi>Harold</hi> King of <hi>Norway</hi> sent him a Ship whose Stern was Gilded, and its Sails Purple; and the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors by whom he sent it, being Royally received in the City of <hi>York,</hi> were rewarded with Noble Presents. <hi>Hugh</hi> King of the <hi>French,</hi> sent <hi>Anwulf,</hi> Son of <hi>Baldwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> (Grandson to King <hi>Edward</hi> by <hi>Aethelswine</hi> his Daughter) as his Ambassador, to demand his Sister in Marriage; who when in a Great Assembly of the Nobility at <hi>Abing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> he had declared the Desires of this Royal Woer, besides Noble Presents of Spices, and Precious Stones, especially Emeralds, such as had never been seen in <hi>England</hi> before, and also brave Horses richly equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, he sent the King a certain Vessel made of an Onyx, curiously en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven with Vines, and the Figures of Men; he likewise presented him with the Sword of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great; in the Hilt of which (being all overlaid with Plates of Gold) was set one of the Nails of Christ's Cross; also with the Lance of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and the Banner of the <hi>Martyr</hi> St. <hi>Maurice,</hi> both which the said King had made use of in a Battel against the <hi>Saracens</hi>; and a Gold Crown or Diadem set with Precious Stones: But that which was more Valuable than all the rest, was a little Piece of Christ's Cross, and a Bit of his Crown of Thorns, both set in Chrystal, and which the King afterwards bestowed upon the Abby of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> with very large Endowments, (as appears by his Charters above-cited) and in whose Church he had ordered the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of his Cousins <hi>Aelwin</hi> and <hi>Aethelwin,</hi> the Sons of his Uncle <hi>Aethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> to be interr'd, whom he lost in the Battel against King <hi>Anlaf:</hi> And though this King died at <hi>Gloucester,</hi> yet was his Body carried to <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and there interr'd with great Pomp.</p>
               <p>There is yet to be seen in the said Church (of which only the Nave is now left) an Image made for him in Stone, though of no Antiquity, as any one may easily discover, that observes it.</p>
               <p>But since this King also made many good Laws, some of them which are the most remarkable, I shall here set down from Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi>'s <hi>Saxon</hi> Copy.</p>
               <p>These Laws were made at <hi>Graetanleage,</hi> in a Great Council there held by King <hi>Athelstan</hi>; but the Year not being express'd, it is supposed to be about <hi>Anno</hi> 928.</p>
               <p>After a Religious Preface, <q>The first Law is against Thieves, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring that if a Thief be taken in the Fact, no man shall spare him,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:93814:251"/>
if he be above twenty years old,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxli.</note> and had stole any thing above the value of eight pence: If any one do contrarily thereunto, he shall pay the value of the Thief's Head, or make amends for the fault, and yet the Thief himself shall not be spared; who if he contumaciously make Resistance, or fly for it, shall find no favour. A Thief cast into Prison, shall there stay forty days, and then after the payment of an 120 shillings be discharged; but his Kindred must give Security for his future good behaviour; after which, if he steal again, they must either pay the value of his Head, or bring him back to Prison; and in case any one resist, he shall pay to the King, or to any other whom it concerns, the value of his own Head; and if any stand by him <hi>(i. e.</hi> defend him) he shall pay to the King an 120 shillings.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The sixth Law is against Witchcrafts, Enchantments, and such like deeds that procure Death; that if any one by them be made away, and the thing cannot be denied, such Practisers shall be put to death; but if they endeavour to purge themselves, and be cast by the threefold <hi>Ordeal,</hi> they shall lye in Prison an hundred and twenty days; which ended, then their Kindred may redeem them by the Payment of an 120 shillings to the King; and farther pay to the Kindred of the slain the full valuation of the Party's Head; and then the Criminals shall also procure Sureties for their good behaviour for the time to come.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The same Punishment shall be inflicted on Incendiaries, and such as rescue Thieves; nay, such as endeavour to rescue them, though no man be wounded in the attempt, shall pay an 120 shillings to the King.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As for Enchantments, mentioned in this Law, the <hi>Saxon</hi> word is <hi>Liblacum,</hi> which signifies the Art of Conjuration or Witchcraft, yet not all in general, but that sort of it properly called <hi>Fascination,</hi> or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment used by certain <hi>Ligatures, Fasciae,</hi> or Bands.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The seventh ordains concerning simple <hi>Ordeal,</hi> That if one accused several times of Theft, be cast by it, and have no body to be Surety for him, he shall be sent to Prison, and thence freed by his Kindred, as was before said.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The tenth forbids any Commutation of Goods, unless in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the King's Reeve, the Priest of the Town, or the Lord of the Soil, or some other credible person, under the penalty of thirty shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and the forfeiture of the thing changed to the Lord of the Soil; and if any shall bear false witness, he shall be infamous, and no credit given to him ever after, and also shall forfeit 30 shillings.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The twelfth confirms the first part of the Law of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Elder, decreeing no man's buying any thing out of a Town which exceeds the value of twenty-pence; and within the Town, unless in the presence of the Portreeve, or some other credible person; or else in the presence of the King's Sheriff or Justice in <hi>Folcmote.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The fourteenth appoints through all the King's Dominions that one and the same Money be currant, and that it shall not be coined out of some Town; and if any Minter or Coiner shall embase the Coin, he shall lose his hand; which being cut off; shall be affixed to the Workhouse: If any be accused of adulterating Money, and will purge himself, he shall by the <hi>Ordeal</hi> of hot Iron cleanse his hands of such wickedness; but if by <hi>Ordeal</hi> he be cast, then he shall be punished as now was said.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That which follows, commands, That for every Plow a man shall keep two well-furnished Horsemen.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Which shews, that this Law for the Militia's being laid according to the Rate of Estates, is one of the ancientest of this kind in <hi>England,</hi> as also the most general Tax, being laid upon Corn, then the most staple Commodity of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The eighteenth forbids Horses to be transported, except such as are sent abroad as Free Gifts or Presents.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The twentieth Law enacts, That if any one absent himself from <hi>Folcmote</hi> thrice, he shall be punished as contumacious against the King, if so be that the holding of the Assembly was declared a seven-night before; in such case if he refuse to do Right, and pays not his Mulct to the King, the ancient men of the Countrey are to go and seize upon all that he hath, and take Security for his appearance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The twenty second, in confirmation of a former Law, requires, that no person receive another man's <hi>Man</hi> (as this Law words it) into his Family, without leave first obtained of his Master; he that doth otherwise, shall restore the man, and pay the Mulct of Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy against the King; and no man is to put away his men accused of any Crime, till they have first made satisfaction.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By this it appears how ancient in this Nation the Custom is of calling a Servant by the word used for the whole <hi>Species</hi> of Mankind, a Phrase in use as well with the <hi>Romans</hi> and others more ancient, as with modern people.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The twenty fourth is concerning Traffick; and in confirmation of former Laws ordains, That if a man buy any thing with witness, which another man challenges for his own, the Seller shall make it good, and secure the bargain, whether he be Bond or Free: But on the Lord's day no Market shall be held, under penalty or forfeiture of the Wares, and a Mulct of 30 shillings besides.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The next thing that follows at the end of these Laws, relating to the Civil State, is the Valuation of mens Heads, which we have often heard mentioned by these Laws, but never yet to what it particularly amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: First then, saith the Text, <q>The valuation of the King's Head, according to the <hi>English</hi> Common Laws, is thirty thousand <hi>Thrymses,</hi> whereof fifteen thousand are properly the value of his Head, the rest being due to the Kingdom; so that the latter fifteen belonged to the Nation, the former to his Kindred. An Archbishop's and Earl's <hi>Weregild</hi> (as the <hi>Saxons</hi> called the valuation of his Head) is fifteen thousand <hi>Thrymses:</hi> A Bishop's and <hi>Ealdorman</hi>'s eight thousand. A General's of an Army, or an High Marshal's four thousand <hi>Thrymses.</hi> The valuation of a Spiritual <hi>Thane</hi> or Priest, as also of a Temporal <hi>Thane,</hi> was two thousand <hi>Thrymses.</hi> That of a Countreyman (or <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the King,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxli.</note> he shall be valued at 120 shillings; if he possess half a Hide of Land, at 80 shillings: If he have no Land, yet if he be a Freeman, the value of his Head shall be seventy shillings. If a <hi>Ceorl</hi> or Countreyman be so wealthy as to possess five Hides of Land, in case he be killed, the price or value of his Life shall be two thousand <hi>Thrymses</hi>; but if he come to have a Corslet, an Helmet and a Gilt Sword, tho he have no Land, he shall be accounted a <hi>Sithcundmon</hi>; and if his Children or Grandchildren shall grow so rich as to possess five Hides of Land, all their Posterity shall be reckoned as so many <hi>Sithcundmen,</hi> and be valued at two thousand <hi>Thrymses.</hi> The <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> value a Countreyman at two hundred shillings, a <hi>Thane</hi> at twelve hundred. They are wont to equal the single value of the King's Head with six thousand Thanes, that is, thirty thousand <hi>Sceats,</hi> for so much is the value of the King's Head, and as much more must be paid as a recompence for his death; the value of his Head belongs to his Kindred, and the compensation of his Death to the people. He that is valued at 1200 shillings, his Oath shall be of the same esteem as those of six Countreymen; for where such an one is slain, six Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen would satisfy over and above for the value; therefore the value of him and all them shall be the same. By the <hi>English</hi> Law the Oaths of a Priest and a Thane are of the like esteem.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By these valuations of Heads from the highest to the lowest Rank, we may perceive that in those Ancient Times Punishments consisted rather in Mulcts than in Blood; contrary to our present Custom, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by small Offences in comparison (especially if reiterated) are become Capital; which whence it hath proceeded, whether from this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that Crimes in latter Ages do more abound, or from other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, is not evident. As for the <hi>Sithcundmon</hi> mentioned in this Law, Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> derives this word from <hi>Syth</hi> or <hi>Gethysa,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This seems very strange, for most of those places are mentioned to have been before recovered from the <hi>Danes</hi> by King <hi>Edward</hi> his Father; and how they could be conquered again in the time of so great a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier as King <hi>Athelstan</hi> was, I could not understand, were it not explained by other Authors.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The same year King <hi>Aeadmund</hi> received King <hi>Anlaf</hi> to Baptism, and some time after he likewise received King <hi>Reginald</hi> at his Confirmation. This year also King <hi>Anlaf</hi> deceased, and <hi>Richard</hi> the Elder took upon him the Dukedom (of <hi>Normandy</hi>) and governed it 52 years.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>R. Hoveden</hi> and <hi>Mat. Westminster</hi> (from what Authority I know not) relate, That this <hi>Anlaf</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> above-mentioned, and <hi>Norwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi> by Extract, who had been in the time of King <hi>Athelstan</hi> expell'd the Kingdom of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> about this time landed in <hi>Yorkshire</hi> with a great Fleet, resolving to subdue the whole Kingdom of <hi>England</hi>; and marching <hi>Southward</hi> besieged <hi>Northampton</hi>; but not succeeding there, he marched back to <hi>Tamworth,</hi> where having wasted the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey round about, came at last to <hi>Legacester</hi> (now <hi>Westchester)</hi>; which when King <hi>Edmund</hi> heard of, he march'd with a powerful Army, and met him at that City, and having fought with him most part of the day, the two Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> seeing the great Danger and Hazard the Kingdom was then in, made an Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Kings, That <hi>Anlaf</hi> should possess that part of <hi>England</hi> lying <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Watlingstreet,</hi> and King <hi>Edmund</hi> that part which lay <hi>South</hi> of it, and that the Survivor of them should quietly enjoy the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and thereupon <hi>Anlaf</hi> married <hi>Alditha</hi> the Daughter of Earl <hi>Orme,</hi> by whose Counsel and Assistance he obtained the late Victory. But <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> tells this Story somewhat different; <hi>viz.</hi> That about this time the <hi>Northumbers</hi> rebelling, recalled this <hi>Anlaf</hi> out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whom they made their King, but whom nevertheless King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> conquered, and at last expell'd the Kingdom, and so once again added <hi>Northumberland</hi> to his own Dominions; which shews the great uncertainty of the History of these times.</p>

               <p>And they both further relate, That <hi>Anlaf</hi> the Son of <hi>Sihtric</hi> after this reigned again over the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> and was this year expelled that Kingdom by King <hi>Edmund.</hi> But it seems <hi>R.

Westminster</hi> (though under the next year) adds that which is very unlikely to be true, that King <hi>Edmund</hi> conquered this Countrey by the Assistance of <hi>Lewellyn</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and put out the Eyes of the two Sons of <hi>Dunmaile</hi> King of that Province; though what he adds further, appears somewhat more probable, That he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to the King of <hi>Scots</hi> upon this condition, <hi>viz.</hi> To defend the <hi>North</hi>-parts of <hi>England</hi> from the Invasion of Enemies both by Sea and
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:93814:253"/>
Land. To which <hi>Bromton</hi>'s Chronicle adds likewise,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxlvi.</note> That he was also to attend the King of <hi>England</hi> at several Great Feasts in the year, when he held his Common Council; and that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> had for that end several Houses assigned him to lye at by the way.</p>
               <p>Also this year <hi>Mat. Westminster</hi> relates, that King <hi>Edmund</hi> gave one of his Royal Towns, then called <hi>Beadricesworth,</hi> with divers other Lands, to build a Church and Monastery, in Memory of St. <hi>Edmund</hi> the Martyr, whose Body was there enshrin'd.</p>
               <p>This year likewise (as <hi>Florence</hi> relates) King <hi>Edmund</hi> sent Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors to Prince <hi>Hugh</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> for the Restitution of King <hi>Lewis</hi>; whereupon the said Prince held a Solemn Council with all the Chief Men of the Kingdom concerning it: But not long after,</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edmund</hi> deceased at the Feast of St. <hi>Augustin</hi>; having held the Kingdom Six Years and an half.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Laudean</hi> or <hi>Peterburgh</hi> Copy of these Annals, as also <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werd</hi>'s Chronicle, place the Death of this King <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 948; which without doubt is the truest Account.</p>
               <p>So that he died in the very Flower of his Age, being not yet Five and twenty years old: But we shall give you the manner of his Death, from <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> as well as from other Authors, since he met with such an End, the like to which I have not read of any other Prince, taking all the Circumstances together: And thus we find it: He having made a Great Entertainment at a place called <hi>Pucklekirk,</hi> upon the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day of St. <hi>Augustin</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for all his Nobility and Chief Men, and there spying towards the end of Dinner a certain No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Thief called <hi>Leof,</hi> sitting at the Table, whom he had before banished, commanded <hi>Leon</hi> his Sewer to lay hold on him: But the Thief not only resisted him, but was also like to have killed the Sewer: Whereupon the King (leaping from the Table, and) going to rescue him out of the Villain's hands, and having now laid hold on him, and thrown him on the ground, he twisted his hands in his hair; upon which the Thief pulling out a Dagger, stabbed the King (who lay upon him) into the Breast, so that he immediately expired; but the King's Servants presently coming in, soon cut the Villain to pieces; though some of them were first wounded by him. The King's Body was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon carried to <hi>Glastenbury,</hi> and there buried; and the Town wherein he was killed was bestowed on the same Monastery to sing Masses for his Soul. To this Place the Prince (as well as his Brother) was a great Benefactor; as appears by his recited Charter in <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> whereby he confers divers large Privileges upon that Abby, of which St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> was then the Abbot: And it is also to be observed, that He there stiles himself in the beginning of his Charter, <q>
                     <hi>Edmund,</hi> King of the <hi>English,</hi> and Governor and Ruler of the other Nations round about; and says, That with the Advice, and by the Consent of his Chief Men, and for the Remission of his Sins, He made that Grant to the Church of St. <hi>Mary</hi> at <hi>Glastenbury.</hi>
                  </q> This Charter bore date <hi>Anno</hi> 944. in Letters of Gold, and was written at the end of a Book of Gospels which he had given to the same Church, most curiously bound. So that it is no wonder if he had the good words of the Monks; though he might also very well deserve them; yet this last Action speaks him to have been extremely transported with Passion, thus to debase the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of a King, in going about to seize a common Malefactor with his

                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxlvi.</note> and indeed he paid too dear for thus acting below his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
               <p>This King made divers good Laws; which since the Title does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in what year they were made, I have referred to this place; some of which I shall here give you, translated from the <hi>Latin</hi> Copies in Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot <hi>Bromton</hi>'s Chronicle, as well as from Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi>'s Collection.</p>
               <p>In the Preface of which we are told, <q>That at the solemn Feast of <hi>Easter</hi> the King had held a Great Council at <hi>London,</hi> as well of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks as Laicks, where were present <hi>Odo</hi> and <hi>Wulstan,</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, with many other Bishops, to consult for the good of their own Souls, and of those that were committed to their Care and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>At which Synod or Council were enacted several Laws; <hi>viz.</hi> but they being six in number, of mere Ecclesiastical Concernment, as for paying <hi>Tithes,</hi> and against Fornication with <hi>Nuns,</hi> and <hi>Perjury,</hi> I omit them.</p>
               <p>Then Follow, in <hi>Bromton</hi>'s Copy, seven other Constitutions of Civil Concernment, said to have been made by the King, his Bishops, and <hi>Wise Men,</hi> at <hi>Cullington,</hi> not extant in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Edition.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The first of these requires an Oath of Fidelity to be taken by all to King <hi>Edmund,</hi> in like manner as a man ought to bear Faith to his Lord, without any Controversy or Sedition, both in publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; to love whom the King should love, and to hate whom he should hate; and before the Oath be given, that no man should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal a Crime in his Brother or Neighbour, more than in a Stranger.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The second, concerning the apprehension of Thieves, enjoins, that if it be known for certain where a Thief is, the <hi>Twelfhind</hi> and <hi>Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind men (i. e.</hi> the former worth Twelve hundred, and the latter Two hundred Shillings of Estate) should combine together, and take him either alive or dead; but in case any man take up a mortal Feud against another for so doing, he is to be esteemed as the Enemy of the King, and all his Friends: And if any refuse to assist in his apprehension, he shall forfeit to the King an 120 shillings, and to the Hundred 30 shillings.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The fourth enjoins, That if several Thieves do steal, the eldest of them shall be hanged, and each of the rest be whipp'd thrice, and for an Example have his little finger cut off.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This I take notice of, because it is the first Law whereby Thieves are expresly ordered to be hanged, without being admitted to pay their <hi>Weregild,</hi> or Price of their Heads.</p>
               <p>The fifth and sixth being against buying and receiving Strangers Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, I pass by.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The seventh enjoins, that every Person make his Servants, and all that live within his Peace (<hi>i. e.</hi> his District), and on his Lands, to give Security; and also that all others of Ill Fame who lye under Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations, should have Security given for them; and what Officer, Thane, Ealdorman, or Countreyman soever he be, that refuseth to do according thereunto, shall forfeit 120 shillings, and further be deemed worthy of such Punishments as have been before mentioned.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After these follow seven other of King <hi>Edmund</hi>'s Laws, found both in <hi>Bromton</hi> and <hi>Lambard</hi>'s Copies; before which also we find a Preface, <q>Wherein the King signifies to all Subjects both old and young, that he had most studiously enquired in a Solemn Assembly of Ecclesiasticks
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:93814:254"/>
and Laicks,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxlvi.</note> by what means the Christian Life might best be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and that it seemed most convenient to them all, that he should cherish and procure Love and mutual Friendship through all his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; for they were much troubled at the unjust Divisions and Contentions among them; therefore the King and they did now or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>First, That if hereafter one man kill another, he alone should bear the <hi>Deadly Feud</hi> or Enmity of the Kindred of the Party slain, unless within Twelve Months by the assistance of his own Kindred, he should pay the <hi>Weregild,</hi> or value of the slain man's head, of what condition soever he was; and then they should not be taken for Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; in the mean time they shall not relieve him, nor have peace with him, and if they do or have, they shall forfeit all their Estate to the King; and he that shall kill any man, shall be taken as an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by all the Kindred of the slain, and they may maintain Deadly Feud against him; and if any shall revenge himself upon, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute any other of his Kindred besides the Manslayer himself, he shall forfeit all he hath, and be taken as an Enemy both by the King and all that love him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Which Law was made, because before this, if one man killed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Kindred of the slain had a Mortal Feud, and revenged his Death upon any of the Relations of the Murderer; as they do among the <hi>Indians</hi> even to this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The second denounces, That if a man fly to a Church, or to the King's Town, and there any one set upon him, or do him harm, he shall be punished in the same manner.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>By the third, the King expresly forbids, that any Fyhtwite, or <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bote</hi> (that is, any Fine for fighting or killing) be remitted.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>By the fourth, the King op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nly declares, that his House shall afford no shelter to him that hath shed blood, except he have first made sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to God, and the Kindred of the Party slain, and done what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever was enjoined him by the Bishop in whose Diocess the Fact was committed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The sixth enjoins, That he that breaks the Peace, and sets upon a man in his own house, shall forfeit all he hath, and his Life be at the Kings's Mercy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The seventh and last of these Laws is also concerning Enmities or Deadly Feuds; declaring that it is the Duty of all Wise Men to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press them, and prescribing the way and means of doing it.</q> As</p>
               <p>
                  <q>First, That an Indifferent Friend be sent before to the Kindred of him that is slain, to signify to them, that he that killed him will make all due satisfaction; upon which the Manslayer shall be delivered into his hands, that he may safely appear, and give Caution for the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the value of the dead man's head; which as soon as he hath done, the King's Peace is next to be made betwixt them: Then after the end of one and twenty days, he shall pay <hi>Halsfage</hi> (according to <hi>Bromton</hi>'s Copy, or as the <hi>Saxon</hi> Text has it, <hi>Healfange</hi>) that is (as Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi> interprets it) that which was paid in Commutation for the Punishment of hanging by the Neck, to the King or Lord.</q> The rest, as being tedious, I omit; for I think sufficient to let the Reader understand the nature of these Deadly Feuds, or Family Quarrels, among the <hi>English</hi> who were derived from the Ancient <hi>Saxons, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:93814:255"/>
and other barbarous <hi>Northern</hi> Nations,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxlvi.</note> that commonly maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed private Quarrels by their whole Kindred, thereby rendring their Feuds as it were Hereditary. So <hi>Tacitus</hi> writes concerning the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> that they were forced to take up the Quarrels and Friendships of their Fathers and Kinsmen.</p>
               <p>Besides these Laws before-mentioned, there is some other Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ascribed to the same King <hi>Edmund,</hi> concerning the Manner and Rites of Marriage; and though found by Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi> in <hi>Saxon</hi> (in an Ancient Book belonging to <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge</hi>) tacked to the Laws of King <hi>Alfred</hi>; yet <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Col.</hi> 861.</note> 
                  <hi>Bromton</hi> reckons them amongst the Laws of King <hi>Edmund,</hi> and I think they ought rather to be supposed his: They are to this effect; <q>That where a man resolves to marry a Woman with her Friends Consent, the Bridegroom shall give Caution or Security by his Friends, not only to marry her, but also to fulfil the Covenants made between them, and shall also engage to maintain her. After that, the Bridegroom is to declare what he will give his Bride, besides that which she formerly made choice of with his good liking, if she survive him. In case they so agree, it provides, that after his Decease she shall have the one half of all his Estate; and if they have a Child betwixt them, the whole, till such time as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry again. Then when they have agreed on all things, the Kindred of the Bride shall contract her to him, and engage for her Honesty; and at the same time they shall give Caution for the Celebration of the Marriage.</q> The rest being not very material, I omit; and have only set down these, to let the Reader see the Antiquity of Covenants before Marriage, and of Bonds for the performance of them; as also of Join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Thirds of the Estate not being then settled by Law, as <hi>Dower,</hi> by what I can find.</p>
               <p>Having now finished the Reign of King <hi>Edmund,</hi> I have no more to observe, but that though he left two Sons by the Queen his Wife, (<hi>viz. Edwi</hi> and <hi>Edgar),</hi> yet notwithstanding his Brother <hi>Edred</hi> succeeded to him as Next Heir, (for so <hi>Ethelwerd,</hi> as well as <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> stiles him.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>THIS year (according to our Annals) <hi>Eadred Aetheling</hi> after his Brother's Decease was made King,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxlvi.</note> and presently reduced all <hi>Northumberland</hi> under his Obedience: Upon which the <hi>Scots</hi> also swore to perform whatever he would require of them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But the Manuscript Life of St <hi>Dunstan,</hi> written by a Monk of those times, and which is now in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cleop.</hi> D. 7.</note> is much more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular concerning this King's Succession; saying, That King <hi>Edmund</hi> being slain, <hi>Eadred</hi> took the Kingdom, succeeding to his Brother as his Heir. Which is also confirmed by <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> who says, That <hi>Edred</hi> being Next Heir to his Brother, succeeded him: And <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werd</hi> gives us the reason of it more fully, That he succeeded him <hi>quippe ejus Haeres,</hi> because he was Next Heir. And <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adds, That this King was Crowned at <hi>Kingston,</hi> by <hi>Odo</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>H. Huntington</hi> and <hi>Mat. Westminster</hi> give us the Particulars of this War against the <hi>Northumbers</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> more at large; <hi>viz.</hi> That he subdued the <hi>Northumbrians</hi> with a powerful Army, they refusing to submit to his Dominion; and that the <hi>Scots</hi> thereupon being afraid, submitted themselves to him without any War at all; and that the King of the <hi>Scots</hi> swore <hi>Fidelity to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It seems here by <hi>Ingulph,</hi> that this Submission of the <hi>Northumbers</hi> was wrought by the means of <hi>Turketule,</hi> Chancellor to King <hi>Edred,</hi> and afterwards Abbot of <hi>Croyland,</hi> who was now sent Ambassador to the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> to reduce them to their Duty; which he upon his Arrival at <hi>York</hi> performed with that Prudence and Diligence, that he brought back the Archbishop and all the People of that City to their former Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance.</p>
               <p>But <hi>R. Hoveden</hi> places the Oath taken by the <hi>Northumbrians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dccccxlvii.</note> under this year; and that <hi>Wulstan</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> and all the <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brian</hi> Lords, swore Fealty to King <hi>Edred,</hi> in a Town called <hi>Tadencliff,</hi> though they did not long observe it.</p>
               <p>Under this year most of the <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicles place the death of that Worthy Prince <hi>Howel Dha</hi>; and say, That he left his four Sons, <hi>Owen,</hi>

                  <hi>Run, Roderic,</hi> and <hi>Edwin,</hi> his Heirs of all his Territories in <hi>South-Wales</hi>: But as for <hi>North Wales,</hi> it returned to the two Sons of <hi>Edwal Voel,</hi> called <hi>Jevaf</hi> and <hi>Jago,</hi> (because <hi>Meyric</hi> their Elder Brother was not thought fit to govern): These, as being of the Elder House, would have had the Supreme Government of all <hi>Wales,</hi> which, being denied them by the Sons of <hi>Howel,</hi> caused great and long Wars between them.</p>
               <p>Yet nothwithstanding, other of the <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicles place the death of <hi>Howel Dha</hi> much later, for they make him Contemporary with our King <hi>Edgar,</hi> as shall be shewn when we come to the History of his Reign in the next Book.</p>

               <p>This is the same with <hi>Eric</hi> mentioned by <hi>Hoveden,</hi> who yet did not immediately enter upon the Throne (as that Author supposes) till <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laf</hi> had been expell'd; but <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> and the Chronicle of <hi>Mailrosse,</hi> place the expulsion of <hi>Anlaf,</hi> and the setting up of <hi>Eric,</hi> two years sooner, and perhaps with better reason: For the same year, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Hoveden,</hi> King <hi>Edred</hi> made <hi>Wulstan</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> close Prisoner at <hi>Witharbirig,</hi> because he had been often accused to him upon divers accounts; Yet <hi>Will.

But after he had kept him a long time in Prison, he thought fit to pardon him, out of reverence to his Function: And the year following, the Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Mailrosse</hi> relates, that Archbishop <hi>Wulstan</hi> being set free, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to his Episcopal Function at <hi>Doncacester.</hi> But this is certain, King <hi>Edred</hi> could not have done this till after <hi>Eric</hi> had been driven out (as this Author more truly reckons), tho our Annals do it the next year; saying, That</p>

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:93814:257"/>
force, and wasted all that Kingdom with fire and sword. After which the <hi>Northumbrians</hi> being wholly subdued, were no more governed by Kings but Earls; a Catalogue of which <hi>Roger Hoveden</hi> hath there given us, as far as the Conquest.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edred</hi> having been (as <hi>Malmesbury</hi> informs us) long torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with frequent Convulsions in several parts of his Body,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dcccclv.</note> being admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by Archbishop <hi>Dunstan</hi> of his approaching death, did not only bear that affliction with Patience, but spending his time in acts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, made his Palace a School of all Vertues, and being at length consumed by a tedious long sickness, he (according to the Annals) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this life at the Feast of St. <hi>Clement,</hi> in the very flower of his Age, to the great grief of all his Subjects, after having Reigned Nine Years and an half.</p>
               <p>But the Manuscript life of St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> (already cited) is much more particular as to the Disease he died of, <hi>viz.</hi> that not being able to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Meat, he could only eat Broth, so that being wasted away, he died.</p>
               <p>This Relation of King <hi>Edred</hi>'s not being able to swallow his Meat, gave occasion to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Wallingford</hi> absurdly to tell us in his Chronicle (not long since Printed) that King <hi>Edred</hi> having his Teeth fallen out by reason of Old Age, could not Chew his Meat,<note place="margin">Edit. Oxon. 1691.</note> and the Broths they made for him were not sufficient to keep him alive, and so he died of Hunger.</p>
               <p>But this is altogether as true as the story that follows, not only in this Author, but in most other Monkish Writers of the History of those times (from the Relation of the above-cited Author of St. <hi>Dunstan</hi>'s Life) that St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> hearing how dangerously Ill the King was, and making haste to Visit him before he died, as he rode on the way thither, there came a Voice from Heaven, which cried aloud to him, <hi>King</hi> Edred <hi>is now dead</hi>; at which all present being astonished, the poor Horse, upon which St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> was then Mounted, immediately fell down dead. But <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> though he mentions this story of the Voice, yet is so wise as to pass by the death of the Horse, being sensible it was a Pill too large to be easily swallowed.</p>
               <p>As for the Character of this King, the Monkish Writers of those times, give him that of a most Vertuous and Pious Prince; and as to his Valour, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> saith, he was not inferior in Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity to either of his Brothers; he was also the first King of <hi>England</hi> who (as I can find) stiled himself <hi>Rex Magnae Britanniae,</hi> King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> in a Charter to the Abbey of <hi>Croyland</hi> recited by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulphus</hi>; as also in another Charter to the Abbey of <hi>Reculver</hi>; in <hi>Monast. Anglic.</hi> he stiles himself <hi>Totius Albionis Monarchus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vol. 1.</note> i. e. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of all <hi>England</hi>; In which Stile he was also followed by his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew King <hi>Edgar</hi>; from whence we may observe, That King <hi>James</hi> was not the first who took upon him the Title of King of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> though as being also King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he did much better deserve it than the former.</p>
               <p>But as for King <hi>Edred,</hi> he could not fail of the good will of the Monks, since the same Manuscript Author of <hi>St. Dunstan</hi>'s Life relates, That he put such great confidence in that Holy Abbot, that he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the chief Muniments and Treasures of his Kingdom to his Care, to be kept at his Abby of <hi>Glastenbury</hi>; and that as the King lay on his

               <p>Nor did this King die without Issue (as many believe) for Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> proves the contrary from certain ancient Charters Cited by him at the end of this King's Life; wherein you will find that his Two Sons <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frid</hi> and <hi>Bertfrid</hi> were Witnesses to them, tho they did not Succeed their Father, but <hi>Edwi</hi> Son to his Elder Brother <hi>Edmund.</hi>

               <p>But though <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> gives us all the rest of this Story, yet I shall rather chuse to take it from the <note n="*" place="margin">

Hove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> relates) retired to a Monastery in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor did the King's Resentments stop here, but out of hatred to <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan,</hi> he not only turned the Monks out of <hi>Glastenbury,</hi> but out of divers of the greatest Monasteries in <hi>England</hi>; where also,<note place="margin">

               <p>But tho the King's violence to Abbot <hi>Dunstan,</hi> and the Monks, is by no means to be justified, yet this rudeness to the King, and pressing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his privacy, and carrying him by force out of the Room from his Mistress, or Wife, (for some Historians tell us that he had been privately married to her) can as little be excused: So that no wonder if a young

               <p>Yet it seems by the same Author of St. <hi>Dunstan</hi>'s Life, that Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Odo</hi> was severely revenged on this Lady; for he not only sent Armed men, to take her out of the Court by force, but also branded her with a hot Iron on the Cheeks, to take off the King's Affections from her, and then caused her to be sent into <hi>Ireland</hi>; but whether this was done by the Great Council of the Kingdom, or by his own Authority, I do not find: But it seems, upon her return thence again, being on her way to the King, the said Archbishop's Officers met her, and cut her Hamstrings; so that not being able to stir, she is supposed to have died not long after, of this cruel Treatment. But however, this did not happen immediately, but some time after; for this Year all the People North of <hi>Humber,</hi> together with the <hi>Mercians,</hi> as far as the River <hi>Thames,</hi> rose against King <hi>Edwi,</hi> with an intention to expel him the Kingdom, for his violence done to the Monks; so that, as <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Osborne</hi> in the Life of <hi>Dunstan</hi> relates, he was forced to fly with his Adulteress to the City of <hi>Glocester</hi>: But <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> are more particular in this Relation, saying, that the <hi>Mercians</hi> and <hi>Northumbrians</hi> hating and despising King <hi>Edwi</hi> for his Evil Government, deserted him, and having deposed him, they <hi>elected</hi> his Brother Prince <hi>Edgar</hi> King over them; which it seems was also <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Common Council of the Kingdom</hi>; for the above-cited Author of the Life of St. <hi>Dunstan,</hi> saith it was <hi>done by the Common Consent of all the Wise men of the Kingdom.</hi> So that <hi>Edwi</hi> having no more left him than the Kingdom of the <hi>West Saxons</hi> for his share, the River <hi>Thames</hi> was made the Boundary between their two Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry de Knighton,</hi> out of some Ancient Chronicles then preserved in the Abbey of <hi>Legcester,</hi> here farther relates, That after the Expulsion of King <hi>Edwi</hi> for his Evil Life, and the Enormous Deeds which he committed against the Church, the Throne was vacant for above a year, and many Murthers and Robberies, and other Mischiefs were committed in the Kingdom, for want of Government, till some Good men of the Clergy and Laity, seeking God by frequent Prayers, heard at last a Voice from Heaven, commanding them to Crown Prince <hi>Edgar</hi> (being yet a Youth) their King, which they immediately obeyed.</p>
               <p>But this sounds like a Monkish Legend, only to enhance the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Reign, which with them must owe its Original to no less an Author than Heaven it self; but no other Historians men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any such thing, but agree that King <hi>Edwi</hi> was never deprived of more than the Kingdoms of <hi>Mercia</hi> and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and there was no Vacancy of the Throne, that Division being made presently upon the aforesaid Defection of the People of these Kingdoms, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately confirmed by an Act of the <hi>Witena Gemote,</hi> as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready related.</p>
               <p>But however it happened, King <hi>Edwi</hi> was forced to rest contented with this unequal division, since not having the good-will of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, it was well he could keep what he had. From whence we may observe, how dangerous a thing it was, for Princes to provoke the Ruling Part of the Priests and People of those times, who could so easily turn the hearts of their Subjects against them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:93814:259"/>Our Annals, though they are very short in this Relation, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the deposing of King <hi>Edwi; viz.</hi> That this Year <hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> took upon him the Kingdom of the <hi>Mercians</hi>; and also adds, That not long before, <hi>Wulstan,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> deceased.</p>
               <p>Although the printed Copy of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals place the Death of King <hi>Edwi</hi> under the year 957,<note place="margin">

But it is no wonder if he have a very bad Character of them, when the Monks, his Enemies, are the only persons that have given it to us: But <hi>H. Huntington,</hi> who was a Secular Priest, and no Monk, is more moderate, by telling us that this King did not uncommendably hold the Scepter. But when in the beginning of his Reign his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom began to flourish, an Untimely Death put a stop to those happy Expectations from him. His Body was buried at <hi>Winchester,</hi> with his Uncle's.</p>

               <head>King EDGAR.</head>
               <p>I Have begun this Period with this Prince's Reign; for though it does not exactly divide the Space of Time between King <hi>Egbert</hi> and the coming in of King <hi>William,</hi> sirnamed the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two equal parts, yet will it much better suit with the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Books into which we have divided this Period: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, King <hi>Edgar</hi> by again reuniting the Kingdom, and enjoying by his Valour as well as his good Fortune, a happy and peaceable Reign, though he was not the first Prince who took upon him the Title of Monarch of all <hi>Albion</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> as hath been already shewn, yet since all the Kings of this Island did willingly submit themselves to his Dominion, he seems to have best deserved that Title, of any I can find.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edwy</hi> being now dead, as our Annals have related, King <hi>Edgar</hi> his Brother began to reign, not only over the <hi>Mercians</hi> and <hi>Northumbers,</hi> but also over all the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Kingdom; that is, (as the Manuscript Author of St. <hi>Dunstan</hi>'s Life relates) he succeeded in his Brother's Kingdom as Heir, and was elected by the Clergy as well as Laity, over both Kingdoms: Which is also confirmed by <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:93814:261"/>
and <hi>R. Hoveden,</hi> who expresly tells us he was elected King by the whole <hi>English</hi> Nation, in the Sixteenth Year of his Age: So that (as the Annals observe) <q>In his days all things succeeded prosperously, God giving him Peace as long as he lived, because he loved his Law, and consulted the Good and Peace of his People, beyond all the Princes that had been in the memory of man before him; and therefore that he had greater Honour in all Nations round him, as well as in his own; and he was by a peculiar Blessing from above so assisted, that Kings and Princes every where submitted themselves to him; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he disposed of all things as he pleased, without fighting.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But one of the first things (that we find in the said Author of St. <hi>Dunstan</hi>'s Life) he did, was, That a great Council being held at a place called <hi>Bradanford</hi> (now <hi>Bradford</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire</hi>) Abbot <hi>Dunstan</hi> was by the general consent of all there present, chosen Bishop of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> for his great Piety and Prudence. And also King <hi>Edgar</hi> being now well instructed by the said Bishop and other Wise Men of the Kingdom, in the Arts of Government, began to discountenance the Wicked and Vicious, and to favour and advance the Good; as also to repair the decay'd and ruined Monasteries, and then to replenish them with God's Servants, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Monks); and in short, to undo what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever his Brother had done before.</p>
               <p>This year, according to our Annals, <hi>Odo,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> dying,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCCLXI.</note> 
                  <hi>Dunstan,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> succeeded in the Archbishoprick: But in this the Author of these Annals is mistaken; for <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> as well as other Authors, assure us, That it was not <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan,</hi> but <hi>Elfin,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> who by the means of some Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers whom he had gained over to him by the prevailing Power of his Presents, procured King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Precept to make him Archbishop. From whence we may observe, That notwithstanding the former Decrees of Synods and Councils in <hi>England,</hi> yet those Elections which were called Canonical, were neither then nor a long time after this observed.</p>
               <p>But as for Bishop <hi>Elfin,</hi> he is said by our Authors to have trampled upon the Tombstone of that Pious Archbishop, <hi>Odo,</hi> his Predecessor, and to have uttered opprobrious Language against his Memory; which his Ghost (it seems) so far resented, that appearing to the new Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop in a Vision, it threatned him with a speedy destruction; but he looking upon it only as a Dream, made what haste he could to <hi>Rome,</hi> to get the Pope's Confirmation, by receiving of his Pall; but in his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney over the <hi>Alpes</hi> he was frozen to death, being found with his Feet in his Horse's belly, which had been killed and opened, to restore heat to them.</p>
               <p>But no sooner did the News arrive of <hi>Elfin</hi>'s death, when (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Florence) Brythelm,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Wells,</hi> was made Archbishop; But because neither of these last Archbishops ever received their Palls from <hi>Rome,</hi> which was then counted essential to that Dignity, I suppose these two last were omitted in our Annals: But this <hi>Brythelm</hi> being not found sufficiently qualified for so great a Charge, he was (as <hi>Osbern</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates) commanded by the King and the whole <hi>Nation</hi> to retire; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he quietly submitted, and returning again to his former Church, <hi>Dunstan,</hi> now Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> (who also held the See of <hi>Worcester in Commendam</hi>) was by the general Consent of the King and all his Wise Men in the great Council of the Kingdom, elected Archbishop
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93814:261" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for his supposed great Sanctity:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCCLXI.</note> Of which the Monks of that Age relate so many Miracles, that it is tedious to read, much more to repeat such stuff; insomuch, that one would admire, (were it not for the extreme Ignorance of that Age) how men could ever hope they should be believe in so short a time after they were supposed to be done.</p>
               <p>Such are those of this Bishop's Harp being hung against the Wall, and playing a whole Psalm without any hands touching it; nay, the Monks can tell us, not only the Tune, but the very Words too. Then the stopping of King <hi>Edmund</hi>'s Horse, when he was just ready to run down a Precipice, at that King's only pronouncing of St. <hi>Dunstan</hi>'s Name to himself. Next, his often driving away the Devil with a Staff, troubling him at Prayers sometimes in the shape of a Fox, sometimes of a Wolf or a Bear. But above all, his taking the Devil by the Nose with a Pair of red hot Tongs; who (being, it seems, an excellent Smith) was once at work in his Forge, when the Devil appeared in the shape of a Handsome Woman, but met with very rough entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for going about to tempt his Chastity, he took his Devilship by the Nose with a Pair of red hot Tongs, till he made him roar. Now if such Grave Authors as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> are guilty of relating such Fictions, what can we expect from those of less Judgment and Honesty?</p>
               <p>But this must be acknowledged, that this Archbishop was a great Propagator of Monkery; many Monasteries being either new built or new founded in his time; and the Clerks or Secular Canons of divers Churches being now to be turned out, were put to their choice, either to quit their Habits or their Places; most of whom rather chose the former, and so gave place to those who being of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s own Order, our Author calls their <hi>Betters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Archbishop <hi>Dunstan</hi> also exercised Ecclesiastical Discipline, without respect of persons, imposing upon King <hi>Edgar</hi> himself a Seven Years Pennance, part of which was, to forbear wearing his Crown during all that time; and this was for taking a Nun out of a Cloyster at <hi>Wilton,</hi> and then debauching her. From all which we may observe, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary it was in those days for a Prince's Quiet as well as Reputation, to be blindly obedient to that which was then called the Church-Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; since King <hi>Edwin</hi> having to do but with one Woman whom they did not like, is branded as one excessively given to Women; whilst King <hi>Edgar,</hi> who gave many more Instances of his Failings in this kind, is reckon'd for a Saint. But as for this Nun, whom they call <hi>Wilfrede, William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> tells us, that tho she were bred in that Monastery, yet was she not then professed, but took upon her the Veil, only to avoid the King's Lust, which yet, it seems, could not secure her from it; for he begot on her that beautiful Lady <hi>Editha,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came also a Nun in the same Monastery of <hi>Wilton,</hi> where her Mother had been professed before; and of which this Young and Virtuous La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being made Abbess, died in the flower of her Age, as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> informs us.</p>
               <p>The same Year also, according to the <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicle, <hi>North Wales</hi> was sorely harass'd by the Forces of King <hi>Edgar:</hi> The Cause of which War, was the Non-Payment of the Tribute due from the King of <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraw</hi> to the King of <hi>London</hi>: But in the end, as <hi>John Beaver</hi> informs

                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> DCCCCLXI.</note> a Peace was concluded on this condition, That King <hi>Edgar</hi> hearing the great Mischief which both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> then received by the vast multitude of Wolves which then abounded, especially in <hi>Wales,</hi> released the Tribute in Money, which the King of <hi>North-Wales</hi> was hitherto obliged to pay, and instead thereof engaged the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> to send him a Yearly Tribute of so many Wolves Heads, in lieu of that Tribute; which the said Prince performed, till within some Years, there being no more Wolves to be found either in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Wales,</hi> that Tribute ceased.</p>
               <p>But to proceed with our Annals: <q>This Year deceased <hi>Aelfgar,</hi> Cousin to the King, (and Earl also of <hi>Devonshire</hi>) whose Body lies buried at <hi>Wilton. Sigeferth</hi> likewise (here called a King, though he was indeed no more than Vice-King, or Earl of some Province) now made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self away, and was buried at <hi>Winborne.</hi> The same Year was a great Mortality of Men, and a very Malignant Feaver raged at <hi>London</hi>: Also the Church of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> (at <hi>London</hi>) was this Year burnt, and soon after rebuilt; and <hi>Athelmod</hi> the Priest went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there died.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have nothing else to add that is remarkable, under this Year, but the Foundation of the Abby of <hi>Tavistock,</hi> by <hi>Ordgar</hi> Earl of <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> afterwards Father-in-law to King <hi>Edgar</hi>; though it was within less than fifty years after its foundation burnt down by the <hi>Danes</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Ethelred</hi>; but was afterwards rebuilt more stately than before.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This Year <hi>Wolfstan</hi> the Deacon deceased, and afterwards <hi>Gyric</hi> the Priest.<note place="margin">

                  </q> These, I suppose, were some men of remarkable Sanctity, in that Monastery, to which this Copy of these Annals did once belong.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The same Year also, Abbot <hi>Athelwald</hi> received the Bishoprick of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and was consecrated on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> being the <hi>Vigil</hi> of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew:</hi> The second year after his Consecration, he repaired divers Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries, and drove the Clerks (<hi>i. e.</hi> Canons) from that Bishoprick, because they would observe no Rule, and placed Monks in their stead. He also founded two Abbies, the one of Monks, and the other of Nuns; and afterwards going to King <hi>Edgar,</hi> he desired him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow upon him all the Monasteries the <hi>Danes</hi> had before destroyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he intended to rebuild them; which the King willingly granted: Then the Bishop went to <hi>Elig,</hi> where St. <hi>Etheldrith</hi> lieth buried, and caused that Monastery to be rebuilt, and then gave it to the care of one of his Monks, named <hi>Brightnoth,</hi> and afterwards made him Abbot of the Monks of that Monastery, where there had been Nuns before: Then Bishop <hi>Athelwald</hi> went to the Monastery which is called <hi>Mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamstead,</hi> which had also been destroyed by the <hi>Danes</hi>; where he found nothing but old Walls, with Trees and Bushes growing among them; but at last he spied hidden in one of these Walls, that Charter which Abbot <hi>Headda</hi> had formerly wrote; in which it appeared, that King <hi>Wulfher,</hi> and <hi>Ethelred</hi> his Brother, had founded this Monastery; and that the King with the Bishop had freed it from all secular servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> had confirmed it by his Bull, as also the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Deus Dedit.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Which Charter, I suppose, is that, the Substance of which is already recited in the Fourth book, <hi>Anno</hi> 656. and which I have there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be forged; for the Monks had then a very fair opportunity to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93814:262" rendition="simple:additions"/>
forge that Charter,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dcccclxiii.</note> and afterwards to pretend they found it in an old Wall: But letting that pass, thus much is certain from the <hi>Peterburgh</hi> Copy of these Annals, <q>That the said Bishop then caused this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery to be rebuilt, placing a new Set of Monks therein; over whom he appointed an Abbot called <hi>Aldulf</hi>: Then went the Bishop to the King, and shewed him the Charter he had lately found; whereby he not only obtained a new Charter of Confirmation of all the Lands and Privileges formerly granted by the <hi>Mercian</hi> Kings, but also many other Townships and Lands there recited; as particularly <hi>Vndale,</hi> with the Hundred adjoining, in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> which had formerly been a Monastery of it self, as may be observed in the account we have already given of the Life of the Archbishop <hi>Wilfrid.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The King likewise granted, That the Lands belonging to that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery, should be a distinct Shire, having <hi>Sac</hi> and <hi>Soc, Tol</hi> and <hi>Team,</hi> and <hi>Infangentheof,</hi> (<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Vid.</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction.</note> which terms I shall explain in another place); the King there also grants them a Market, with the Toll thereof; and that there should be no other Market between <hi>Stamford</hi> and <hi>Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>; and to the former of these the King also granted the Abbot a Mint.</q> But as for the Names of the Lands given, together with the Limits and the Tolls of the Market there mentioned, I refer the Reader to the Charter it self. Then follows the Subscription of the King with the Sign of the Cross, and next the Confirmation of the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with a dreadful Curse on those that should violate it; as also the Confirmation of <hi>Oswald</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York, Athelwald</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> with several other Bishops, Abbots, <hi>Ealdormen,</hi> and <hi>Wisemen,</hi> who all confirmed it, and signed it with the Cross: This was done <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 972. of our Lord's Nativity, and in the sixteenth year of the King's Reign; which shews this Coppy of the Annals to be written divers years after these things were done; as does also more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that short History concerning the Affairs of this Abby, and the Succession of its Abbots for many years after this time. As how <q>Abbot <hi>Adulf</hi> bought many more Lands, wherewith he highly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched that Monastery, where he continued Abbot, till <hi>Oswald</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>York</hi> deceased, and he succeeded him in the Archbishoprick; and then there was another chosen Abbot of the said Monastery, named <hi>Kenulph,</hi> who was afterwards Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi>; he first built a Wall round the Monastery, and gave it the name of <hi>Burgh,</hi> which was before called <hi>Medeshamested</hi>; but he being sometime after made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> another Abbot was chosen from the same Abby, called <hi>Aelfi,</hi> who continued Abbot fifty years: He removed the Bodies of St. <hi>Kyneburge,</hi> and St. <hi>Cynesuith,</hi> which lay buried at <hi>Castra</hi>; and St. <hi>Tibba,</hi> which lay entomb'd at <hi>Rehala, (i. e. Ryal</hi> in <hi>Rutlandshire</hi>) and brought them to <hi>Burgh,</hi> and dedicated them to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> keeping them there as long as he continued Abbot.</q> I have been the more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in the Account of this so Ancient and Famous Monastery, as having been the Episcopal See of the Bishops of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> almost ever since the Dissolution of that Abby in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.</p>
               <p>This Year also (according to <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi>) King <hi>Edgar</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Ethelfreda,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Ordgar</hi> Earl of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> after the Death of her Husband <hi>Ethelwald,</hi> Earl of the <hi>East-Angles</hi>: Of her he begot two Sons, <hi>Edwald</hi> and <hi>Ethelred,</hi> the former of whom died in his

And it was upon this Pretence of Illegitimacy, that Queen <hi>Elfleda,</hi> and those of her Party, would have afterwards put by Prince <hi>Edward</hi> her Son, from being chosen King; as shall be further related in its proper place. But <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and <hi>R. Hoveden,</hi> place King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Marriage with this Lady, under the next year.</p>

               <p>About this time (as <hi>Caradoc</hi>'s Chronicle relates) there arose a great Quarrel between the two Brothers, Princes of <hi>North-Wales, Jevaf</hi> and <hi>Jago,</hi> who had governed jointly ever since the death of <hi>Howel Dha,</hi> till then; when <hi>Jago</hi> seizing upon his Brother <hi>Jevaf</hi> by force, kept him cruelly in Prison for near six years; about which time also <hi>Eneon</hi> the Son of <hi>Owen,</hi> Prince of <hi>South Wales,</hi> taking advantage of these Civil Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions, made War upon <hi>North-Wales,</hi> and subdued all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Gwyn:</hi> So that it is no wonder if the <hi>English</hi> were too hard for these <hi>British</hi> Princes, since they never could agree amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>

               <p>As <hi>Bromton</hi>'s Chronicle informs us, the King did not do as an Insulting Enemy, but as a King, who punished one Evil with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because the Inhabitants of that Island had despised his Royal Laws.

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dcccclxxiii.</note> For it is very certain, that neither in this King's time, nor long after the Conquest, was it ever known, that the King Elect took the Title of King, till after his Coronation.</p>
               <p>Now that our Kings did upon some great occasion repeat the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their Coronation, I shall prove from the Examples both of King <hi>Ethelred,</hi> as well as of King <hi>Richard</hi> the First, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Third; and why it might not be so in the Reign of this King, as well as in either of them, I can see no reason; though the occasion of it is not any where expressed, as I know of.</p>
               <p>But to return to our Annals: <q>After this the King sail'd with all his Fleet to <hi>Legancester,</hi> (i.e. <hi>West-Chester)</hi> where met him Six Kings, who all making a League with him, promised to be his Assistants both by Sea and Land.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And now we have spoke of this King's Fleet, it is fit we give a larger Relation of it, as also of these Princes that here met him, from <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury, Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and other Authors, who increase their Number to Eight Thousand; which being so glorious for our Nation, I shall here set down at large.</p>
               <p>This King was the first who was truly Lord of our Seas; for every Summer (saith <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury)</hi> immediately after <hi>Easter,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Ships from every Shore to be brought into one collected Body, he sailed usually with the <hi>Eastern</hi> Fleet to the <hi>Western</hi> part of the Island; and then sending it back, sailed with the <hi>Western</hi> Fleet unto the <hi>Northern</hi>; and thence with the <hi>Northern</hi> he returned to the <hi>Eastern</hi> Coasts; sailing in this manner quite round the Island; being exceeding diligent to prevent the Incursions of Pyrates, and couragious in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Kingdom against Foreigners, and diligent in the training up of himself and his People for Military Employments.</p>
               <p>Each of these Fleets (as we are told) consisted of One thousand and two hundred Ships, and these also very stout ones for those times: So that the number of all must have amounted to Three thousand and six hundred Sail, as some of our Author expresly relate, but others, Four thousand Vessels; and there are some also that add to these Three, a Fourth Fleet; by which means the Number will be increased to Four thousand and eight hundred Sail; as may be seen in <hi>Mathew Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi> To sustain which Charge, besides the private Contributions of his Subjects, he had also (in the latter end of his Reign) Six Petty Kings under him, who were bound by Oath to be ready at his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to serve him both by Sea and Land; which Oath they took at <hi>Chester,</hi> (as the Annals relate) where he had given them order to meet him, as he sailed about the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi> with a great Navy. Their Names are <hi>Kened</hi> or <hi>Kineth,</hi> King of the <hi>Scots; Malcolm</hi> King of <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> (who at this time, it seems, were so called, though, as we said, the <hi>Cumbrians</hi> had now thrown off that Title, and taken that of (Earls); <hi>Maccuse,</hi> Lord of the Isles; with five Princes of <hi>Wales,</hi> the Names of whom were, <hi>Dusnal, Griffyth, Huuald, Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Judethil</hi>; who all meeting him at his Court at <hi>Chester,</hi> to set forth the Splendor and Greatness of his Dominion, one day he went into a Galley, and caused himself to be rowed by these Petty Princes, he himself holding the Stern, and steering the Vessel along the River <hi>Dee,</hi> was waited on by all his Nobles in another Barge; so he sailed to the Monastery of St. <hi>John Baptist</hi>; where an Oration being made to him, in the same State and

Pomp he retutned to his Palace: Where when he arrived,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dcccclxxiii.</note> he is said to have told his Nobles about him, That then his Successors might boast themselves to be truly Kings of <hi>England,</hi> when they should be (like him) attended by so many Princes his Vassals; as <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> relate it. As for these Petty Kings above-mentioned, <hi>Maccuse,</hi> by the said <hi>Florence, Matthew</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and <hi>R. Hoveden,</hi> is called a King of <hi>Man,</hi> and many other Islands; but <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> stiles him an Arch-pirate; by which word a Robber is not to be understood, but (as <hi>Asser,</hi> and others of that Age use that Appellation) one skilled in Sea Affairs, or a Seaman; so called from <hi>Pira,</hi> which in the <hi>Attique</hi> Tongue, signifies a Craft or Art; but afterward it came to be applicable only to such as without any Right infested the Seas.</p>
               <p>Another of the Kings, and that of <hi>Wales,</hi> was <hi>Huual</hi> or <hi>Hewal,</hi> who tho he be not placed the first in order, yet if we follow the account of some Authors, must have been the chief of them all, the Prince to whom all the rest performed Obedience: The Book of <hi>Landaff</hi> bids us take notice, that at the same time with <hi>Edgar</hi> lived <hi>Howel Dha,</hi> and <hi>Morgan Heu,</hi> (which two yet were the Subjects of King <hi>Edgar.)</hi> But in this, either that Author, or the Chronicle of <hi>Caradoc</hi> must be mistaken, who places the Death of <hi>Howel Dha</hi> under the year 948: And therefore it is more likely that the <hi>Howel</hi> here mentioned, was not <hi>Howel Dha,</hi> but <hi>Howel</hi> the Son of <hi>Jevaf,</hi> who had the year before expell'd his Uncle, and taken upon himself the Principality of <hi>Wales,</hi> notwithstanding his Father was then alive.</p>
               <p>But as for all the rest of these <hi>Welsh</hi> Princes, I do not know how to make them out from their Chronicles, (which give no account of this Action); only I take <hi>Dufnal</hi> to be the Son of <hi>Howel Dha,</hi> and as <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> of <hi>Westminster</hi> says, was then Prince of <hi>South-Wales.</hi> As for <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Judethel,</hi> I suppose they must have been the same with <hi>Jevaf</hi> and <hi>Jago,</hi> as they are called in the <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicles: But as for this Prince <hi>Gryffith,</hi> I can find none such among any of the <hi>Welsh</hi> Princes ruling at that time. But to return to our Annals.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This year <hi>Eadgar</hi> King of the <hi>English,</hi> changed this frail Life,<note place="margin">

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But since our Historians are so very large and full in their Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Prince, as that he was most Religious, Valiant, and Wise, and exceeded all his Predecessors (except King <hi>Alfred,</hi> and King <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan)</hi> it will not, I hope, be amiss to shew you how partial these Monks were to the Memory of this Prince; who though they will needs have to be a Saint, because the either built or repaired so many Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, yet was certainly (if the same <hi>Monkish</hi> Writers are to be believed) guilty of as great Excesses of Lust and Cruelty, as any of his Predecessors; for <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> tells us, that <hi>Ordgar</hi> Duke of <hi>Devonshire</hi> had a Daughter named <hi>Elfreda,</hi> fam'd for an extraordinary Beauty, which caus'd the King to have great Inclinations for her, upon the bare Report made of her to him; but to be more certain, he sent a

Knight called <hi>Athelwold,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dcccclxxv.</note> his Confident to see her, resolving to marry her, if she were found to be handsome as she was reported. <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wold</hi> made haste, and got a sight of her, wherewith he was so smitten, that he concealed the Errand on which he came, and resolved to obtain her for himself; which being easily done, he lessened her to the King, as a Woman but very ordinary, and of so small a Stature, as would misbecome his Royal Bed; so that he married her with the King's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, whose Thoughts were now diverted to other Objects: But at last, the Earl's Enemies discovered the Intrigue, and told the King how he had deceived him; and whom the more to enrage, they omitted no words whereby to set out and enhance the extraordinary Beauty of the Lady: Upon which, the King concealed his Anger, but was resolved by another Stratagem to over-reach him. And the better to effect what he intended, he one day told him pleasantly, that at such a time he would come and see whether his Wife was so fair as she was represented to be. This unexpected Surprize so exceedingly struck him, that he earnestly begg'd of her to consult his Preservation, by putting on her worst Cloaths, and deforming her self by what other means she thought best; for she had now perceived, that instead of a King she had married a Subject, though an Earl; which raised such a Female Indignation in her, that against the coming of King <hi>Edgar</hi> she dressed her self in the most Gay and Charming manner her Pride and Resentment to be thus cheated, could devise; which had such powerful effects upon him, that, his Love being so much the more inflamed, as it had been so long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded, he for a Blind appointed a day of hunting in the Forest called <hi>Warewell,</hi> (now <hi>Harwood</hi> Forest) and there slew <hi>Athelwold</hi> with a Dart. The Earl's Son coming by when the Fact was just committed, and looking upon his Father's dead Body, the King asked him, How he liked this <hi>Game?</hi> To which he answered, That whatsoever pleased the King, ought not to displease him: With which flattering Reply, the King's angry Mind was so appeased, that he ever after highly favoured the Youth; and expiated the Crime committed upon the Father, by the great kindness he shewed to the Son. But a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Ancient Manuscript cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Brutus</hi> (now in the Archbishop's Library at <hi>Lambeth)</hi> relates the latter end of this Story somewhat more for King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Reputation; which since I meet with no where else, I shall here give you: It is, That King <hi>Edgar,</hi> not long after, sending this <hi>Athelwold</hi> (now made an Earl) to secure the Coast of <hi>Northumberland</hi> against the <hi>Danes,</hi> then like to invade it, as he was in his way thither he was set upon by certain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Soldiers, who there slew him, but whether by the King's Order, or no, is not said. As soon as the Earl was dead, the King made Love to his fair Widow, and marrying her, caused her to be crowned Queen, though it much displeased Archbishop <hi>Dunstan,</hi> who could never after this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure her: But <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> adds, that to expiate the Murther of her first Husband, she built a Nunnery in the place where he was slain.</p>
               <p>Another thing laid to this charge, and which shews him to have been more constant in his Love, than could be expected from a Young Prince, so universally addicted as he was to the Fair Sex, of which you have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Instances in Story; one of them here shall suffice. It seems, coming one time to <hi>Andover,</hi> (a Town not far from <hi>Winchester)</hi> he would have had the enjoyment of a certain Ealdorman's Daughter,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93814:265" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mightily celebrated for her Beauty,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dcccclxxv.</note> and commanded her to be brought to his Bed: The Mother of the Virgin not daring flatly to deny, yet ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring to be a Bawd to her own Daughter, resolved to put a Trick on him by the favour of the Night, and so sent a Waiting-Maid she had, in her room, one that was Handsome enough, and not Unwitty, as she quickly made to appear; for as soon as it was morning she offering to get up, the King asked her, Why she would make such haste from him? She replied, she could no longer have the Happiness of his Company, because her Lady had set her some Work to do. He startling at this, wonder'd what she meant (for he did not in the least question, but that his Bedfellow had been the Earl's real Daughter); she then most passionately besought him to set her free from the hard and cruel Service of her Lady, as a Reward for her lost Virginity: But the King being confounded at his disappointment, was for some time divided between Compassion for the poor Maid, and Anger at his being thus abused; but at last he put it off with a Jest, and setting her free, carried her along with him, and loved her to that degree, that he kept himself to her alone, until such time as he married <hi>Elfreda</hi> above-mentioned.</p>
               <p>These were the Stories commonly told in those days of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> and of which more noise had been made by the Monks, if he had not built so many Monasteries, which stopp'd their mouths from saying much ill of one so devoted to their Order, and who perhaps admired Chastity in others, though he could not practise it himself.</p>
               <p>But it's certain <hi>England</hi> highly flourished under his Government, being a Man so truly answering <hi>Homer</hi>'s Description of a King, that not only secured his people from Foreign Enemies, but Savage Beasts, by laying a Yearly Tribute of Three hundred Wolve's Heads on the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> as hath been already related.</p>
               <p>What his Employment was in Summer, we have already seen; in Winter he hunted, but in the Spring he usually rode a kind of Circuit round the Kingdom, to administer Justice to his People, and take care that his Officers did the like. He was small of Stature, and Slender, yet of such mighty Courage and Strength, that he would challenge the most Robust to wrestle with him, forbidding them to spare him out of respect to his Person.</p>
               <p>It happen'd one time, that <hi>Kened</hi> King of the <hi>Scots,</hi> came to his Court, to whom (as <hi>Matthew Westminster</hi> relates) he gave Rich Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, with the whole Countrey of <hi>Lothian,</hi> on condition that he and his Successors at his Festivals should come and attend on the Kings of <hi>England</hi> when they sate Crowned; besides, he assign'd certain Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for them by the way, which to ease them in their Journey, were till the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, held by the Kings of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Kened,</hi> as he once sate at his Cups with his Courtiers, said jestingly to them, It was very strange that so many Provinces should obey such a Little, Contemptible Figure of a Man, as this <hi>Edgar</hi> was. These Words soon reach'd the King's ears; upon which he presently sends for <hi>Kened,</hi> and as if he had a mind to consult him about some Important Affair, carries him into a Wood, where none being present besides themselves, he delivers into his hands one of the two Swords he had brought along with him, and then tells him, That as they were now alone, so they had a very good opportunity to try their Strength and Skill; and therefore he was resolved to have it forthwith
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93814:266"/>
determined which of them ought to Rule,<note place="margin">

Upon which the King being as Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as he was Couragious, freely forgave him.</p>
               <p>But though this King <hi>Edgar</hi> was certainly a very Great and Heroick Prince, yet questionless that Charter which makes him to have subdued the greatest part of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and to be Lord of all the Isles as far as <hi>Norway,</hi> is fictitious, and nothing but a piece of Monkish Forgery, no Author of that Age making mention of any such thing; and instead of a Great Warrior, he is usually stiled <hi>Edgar</hi> the Peaceable; for he never made any Foreign Wars, that we can learn. However, such was his mighty Fame, that if he did not go himself to Foreigners, they came to him, out of <hi>Saxony, Flanders, Denmark,</hi> and other places: Though <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> observes, their coming over did much detriment to the Natives; who from the <hi>Saxons,</hi> learned Rudeness; from the <hi>Flemings,</hi> Effeminacy; and from the <hi>Danes,</hi> Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness; the <hi>English</hi> being before free from those gross Vices, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themselves to defend their own with a natural Simplicity, and not given to admire the Customs and Fashions of other Nations: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Monk tells us he is deservedly blamed in Story for his too great Indulgence to Strangers.</p>
               <p>This Noble Prince died when he had Reigned about Sixteen Years, in the very flower of his Age, being scarce Two and thirty years old, and with him fell all the Glory of the <hi>English</hi> Nation; scarce any thing henceforth being to be heard of among them, but Misery and Disorder.</p>
               <p>He had by <hi>Egelfleda,</hi> sirnamed the <hi>Fair,</hi> the Daughter of Earl <hi>Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> (it's uncertain whether his Wife or Concubine) a Son named <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> who succeeded him: By <hi>Wilfrida</hi> the Nun he had a Daughter named <hi>Editha,</hi> who was also a Nun, as hath been already related: And by <hi>Elfreda</hi> the Daughter of Duke <hi>Ordgar,</hi> a Son called <hi>Edmund,</hi> who died five years before his Father; and another, called <hi>Ethelrede,</hi> who reigned after him; but was wholly unlike him in Prudence and Courage.</p>
               <p>I have nothing else to add that is considerable, under this year, but the death of the Noble <hi>Turketule,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Croyland,</hi> whom from Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor to King <hi>Edred,</hi> was (at his own desire) by him made Abbot. He repaired and much enriched that Abby, after its being ruined by the <hi>Danes</hi>; and was the first that by adding to the Two Great Bells of that Monastery, Six more, made the first Tuneable Rings of Bells in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; as <hi>Ingulph</hi> at the end of the account he gives of his Life, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us.</p>
               <p>But before I dismiss this King's Reign, it is fit I give you a short ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the chief Laws he made; which since neither the time nor place of their enacting are any where mention'd, I refer to this place.</p>
               <p>The Preface of these Laws is thus; <q>This is the Decree or Law which King <hi>Edgar</hi> made, with the counsel (or consent) of his <hi>Wites</hi> or <hi>Wisemen,</hi> for the Honour of God, the Confirmation of his Royal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and for the Good of his People.</q>
               </p>

                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:93814:266" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <q>The Laws themselves begin with some Ecclesiastical Canons,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dcccclxxv.</note> the first of which is concerning the Immunities of the Church, and about paying Tythes out of the Lands of the <hi>Thanes,</hi> as well as of those of <hi>Ceorles,</hi> or Countrey-men.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Second is concerning payment of Tythes and First fruits, as well where a <hi>Thane</hi> had a Church with a Burying-place, as also where he had not.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Third appoints the times the Tythes should be paid at; and what Remedy was to be had, in case they were not paid at the time when they were due.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Fourth ordains at what time of the year <hi>Peter-pence</hi> should be paid; and the Penalty that should be incurred by those that should neglect to pay them in accordingly.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The last ordains every <hi>Sunday</hi> to be kept holy, and to begin at Three a Clock in the Afternoon on <hi>Saturday,</hi> and to end at break of day on <hi>Monday,</hi> upon the penalty appointed by the Judiciary Book.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From which last Law you may observe, how early keeping the <hi>Sunday</hi> like the <hi>Jewish</hi> Sabbath, began in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then follow the Secular, or Temporal Laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The First of which enjoins, that every man poor or rich enjoy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Law, and have equal Justice done him; and for Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he would have them so moderated, that being accommodated to the Divine Clemency, they may be the more tolerable unto men.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Second forbids Appeals to the King in Suits,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>From whence we may gather, that Fines at this time were not Arbitrary, nor could be set above a known constant Rate; such as a man, according to his Quality, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the loss of his Life or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi>
                     </note> except Justice cannot otherwise be obtained. And if a man be oppressed he may betake himself to the King for relief; and in case a Pecuniary Mulct be inflicted for a fault, it must not exceed the value of the man's head.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Third imposes a Mulct of an Hundred and twenty Shillings to the King, upon a Judge that passes an unjust Sentence against any man, except such Judge will take his Oath that he did it not out of any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, but only from Unskilfulness, and Mistake in Judgment; and in such case he is to be removed from his Place, except he can obtain fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the King longer to retain it; and then the Bishop of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess is to send the Mulct imposed upon him to the King's Treasure.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Fourth commands, That whosoever maliciously shall defame another man, whereby he receives any damage either in his Body or Estate, so that the defam'd Party can clear himself of those Reports, and prove them false, then the Defamer's Tongue shall either be cut out, or he shall redeem it with the value of his Head.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Fifth is to the same effect as in another Law we have formerly cited, commanding every one to be present at the <hi>Gemote,</hi> or Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Hundred; and further ordains, That the <hi>Burghmotes,</hi> or Assemblies of the great Towns or Cities, be held thrice a year, and the <hi>Shiregemotes,</hi> or general Meeting of the whole County twice, whereat were to be present the Bishop and the Ealdorman, the one to teach the people God's Law, and the other Man's.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From whence you may observe the Antiquity of our Charges at our Assizes and Sessions, which no doubt do succeed those Discourses which the Ealdorman and Bishop then made to the people upon the subjects above-mentioned.</p>

                  <q>The Sixth requires, that every man find Sureties for his Good Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and in case any one commit a Crime, and fly for it, the Sureties should undergo what should be laid upon him. If he stole any thing, and be taken within a Twelvemonth, he should be brought to Justice, and then the Sureties should receive back what they had paid on his account.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Hence we may also take notice, not only of the Antiquity of <hi>Frank-Pledges,</hi> which had been long before instituted by King <hi>Alfred,</hi> but also the continuation of this Law by King <hi>Edgar</hi>; from whence it appears, that it was no <hi>Norman</hi> invention, introduced to keep under the <hi>English</hi> Commonalty, as some men have without any just cause imagined.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Seventh ordains, That when any one of evil report is again accused of a Crime, and absents himself from the <hi>Gemotes,</hi> or publick Meetings, some of the Court shall go where he dwells, and take Sureties for his Appearance, if they may be had; but if they cannot get them, then they should take him alive or dead, and seize on all his Estate; whereof the Complaining Party having received such a share as should satisfy him, the one half of the remainder shall go to the Lord of the Soil, and the other half to the Hundred: And if any of that Court (being either akin to the Party, or a stranger to his Blood) refuse to go to put this in execution, he should forfeit 120 shillings to the King: And farther, That such as are taken in the very act of stealing, or betraying their Masters, should not be pardoned during life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Eighth and last ordains, That one and the same Money should be current throughout the King's Dominions, which no man must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse; and that the measure of <hi>Winchester</hi> should be the Standard; and that a <hi>Weigh</hi> of Wool should be fold for half a Pound of Money, and no more.</q> The former of those is the first Law whereby the Private Mints to the Archbishops and several Abbots being forbid, the King's Coin was only to pass.</p>

               <head>King EDWARD, sirnamed the Martyr.</head>
               <p>KING <hi>Edgar</hi> being dead,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dcccclxxv.</note> (as you have now heard) Prince <hi>Edward</hi> succeeded his Father, though not without some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, for (as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and <hi>R. Hoveden</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late) the Great Men of the Kingdom were then divided, Archbishop <hi>Dunstan,</hi> and all the rest of the Bishops, being for Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> the Eldest Son of King <hi>Edgar</hi>; whilst Queen <hi>Aelfreda,</hi> Widow to the King, and many of her Faction, were for setting up her Son <hi>Ethelred,</hi> being then about Seven Years of Age, that so she might go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern under his Name: But besides, the pretence was, (which how well they made out, I know not) That King <hi>Edgar</hi> had never been lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly married to Prince <hi>Edward</hi>'s Mother. Whereupon the Archbishops, <hi>Dunstan</hi> and <hi>Oswald,</hi> with the Bishops, Abbots, and many of the Eal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dormen of the Kingdom, met together in a Great Council, and chose Prince <hi>Edward</hi> King, as his Father before his Death had ordained; and being thus <hi>Elected,</hi> they presently Anointed him, being then but a Youth of about Fifteen Years of Age.</p>
               <p>But it seems, not long after the Death of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> though before the Coronation of King <hi>Edward, Roger Hoveden,</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> tell us, that <hi>Elfer</hi> Earl of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> being lustily bribed by large Presents, drove the Abbots and Monks out of the Monasteries, in which they had been settled by King <hi>Edgar,</hi> and in their places brought in the <hi>Clerks (i.e.</hi> Secular Chanons) with their Wives; but <hi>Ethelwin,</hi> Ealdorman of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Elfwold,</hi> and Earl <hi>Brythnoth,</hi> opposed it; and being in the Common Council or Synod, plainly said, They would never endure that the Monks should be cast out of the Kingdom, who contributed so much to the Maintenance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and so raising an Army, they bravely defended the Monasteries of the <hi>East-Angles</hi>; so it seems that during this <hi>Interregnum,</hi> arose this Civil War about the Monks, and the above-mentioned Dissention amongst the Nobility, concerning the <hi>Election</hi> of a new King.</p>
               <p>But this serves to explain that Passage in our Annals, which would have been otherwise very obscure; <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That then there was (<hi>viz.</hi> upon the Death of King <hi>Edgar</hi>) great Grief and Trouble in <hi>Mercia,</hi> among those that loved God, because many of his Servants, (that is, the Monks) were turned out, till God being slighted, shewed Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles on their behalf; and that then also Duke <hi>Oslack</hi> was unjustly ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished beyond the Seas; a Nobleman, who for his Long Head of Hair, but more for his Wisdom, was very remarkable: And that then also strange Prodigies were seen in the Heavens, such as Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers call <hi>Comets</hi>; and as a Punishment from God upon this Nation, there followed a great Famine.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Which shews this Copy of the Annals was written about this very time: And then the Author concludes with <hi>Aelfer</hi> the Ealdorman's commanding many Monasteries to be spoiled, which King <hi>Edgar</hi> had

commanded Bishop <hi>Athelwold</hi> to repair.</q> All which being in the <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonian</hi> Copy, serves to explain what has been already related. But the next year</p>

                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dcccclxxvi.</note>'Was the great Famine in <hi>England,</hi> as just now mentioned.

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dcccclxxvii.</note>This year, after <hi>Easter,</hi> was that great Synod at <hi>Kirtlingtun,</hi> which <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and <hi>R.

               <p>The same year also were great Commotions in <hi>Wales</hi>; for <hi>Howel ap Jevaf,</hi> Prince of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> with a great Army both of <hi>Welsh</hi> and <hi>Englishmen,</hi> made War upon all who defended or succoured his Uncle <hi>Jago,</hi> and spoiled the Countries of <hi>Lhyn, Kelynnoc, Vawr</hi>; so that <hi>Jago</hi> was shortly after taken Prisoner by Prince <hi>Howel</hi>'s men, who after that enjoyed his part of the Countrey in peace.</p>
               <p>Nor can I here omit what some of our <hi>Monkish</hi> Writers, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>John Pike</hi> in his compendious Supplement of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> (now in <hi>Manuscript</hi> in the <note n="*" place="margin">Julius, <hi>D.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library) relates, That there being this year a Great Council held at <hi>Winchester</hi> again to debate this great Affair concerning the turning out of the Monks, and restoring the Secular Chanons, and it being like to be carried in their favour, a Crucifix which then stood in the room, spoke thus, <hi>God forbid it should be so</hi>; This amazing them, they resolved to leave the Monks in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they then were. But whether these words were ever spoke at all, or if they were, whether it might not be by some person that stood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen behind the Crucifix, I shall leave to the Reader to determine as he pleases.</p>

                  <q>Next year all the Grave and Wise Men of the <hi>English</hi> Nation being met about the same Affair, at <hi>Calne</hi> (in <hi>Wiltshire</hi>) fell down together from a certain Upper Room, (where they were assembled in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil) unless it were St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> the Archbishop, who fixed his foot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a certain Beam; but some were sadly bruised and hurt, whilst others were killed outright.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But since <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> hath given us a larger account of this Council, and what was done in it, I shall give it you in his words:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93814:268" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But mens minds being not yet settled,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dcccclxxviii.</note> another Council was summoned at <hi>Calne</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> (but the King was absent by reason of his Youth) where the same Affair was again debated with great Heat and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But when many Reproaches were cast upon Archbishop <hi>Dunstan,</hi> that Bulwark of the Church, who could by no means be shaken, upon a sudden the Floor of the Chamber fell down, all there present being very much bruised, except <hi>Dunstan,</hi> who escaped upon a Beam; all the rest being either hurt or killed. This Miracle, says he, obtained quiet for the Archbishop and all the Monks of <hi>England,</hi> who were for ever after of his opinion.</p>
               <p>This Accident is also related by <hi>Mat. Westminster,</hi> and copied by Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> into his Annals, and is likewise mentioned by other Authors. But it is very probable, that this Misfortune did not happen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the fore-knowledge (if not the Contrivance) of Archbishop <hi>Dunstan,</hi> since he had now persuaded the King not to be there, though he was present at the last Council. But <hi>H. Huntington</hi> would have it be a sign from Heaven, that they should fall from God's love, and be oppress'd by Foreign Nations; as followed not long after.</p>
               <p>And (according to <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi>) there was a Third Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod at <hi>Ambresbury</hi>; but what was done there, he does not tell us.</p>
               <p>But to return to our Annals; <q>The same year King <hi>Edward</hi> was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at <hi>Corfesgeate,</hi> now <hi>Corfe-Castle</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Purbeck,</hi> on the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the <hi>Kalends</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> and was buried at <hi>Werham,</hi> without any Royal Pomp. There was not since the time that the <hi>English</hi> Nation came into <hi>Britain,</hi> any thing done more wickedly than this: But though men murthered him, yet God exalted him; and he that was an Earthly King, is now a Saint in Heaven; and though his Relations would not revenge his Death, yet God perform'd it severely.</q> The rest to the same effect in these Annals I omit, because I would not be tedious. But I shall give you a more particular account of the manner of this Prince's Death, from <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and the Chronicle called <hi>Bromton</hi>'s; the former of which relates it thus; That as for King <hi>Edward,</hi> he was of so extraordinary Religious and Mild a Nature, that for quietness sake, he let his Mother-in-Law order all things as she pleased, giving her all Respects, as to his own Mother, and regarding his Younger Brother with all the tenderness imaginable: She on the contrary, from his Kindness and Love, conceives greater and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Malice against him; and with the Sovereignty she already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, was so ill satisfied, that she must needs take from him the very Title also: This Design she covered with notable dissimulation, till a convenient opportunity presented it self for the execution of it: At length the poor Innocent Prince being one day wearied with hunting, and being very thirsty, (while his Companions followed the Game, and minded not what became of him) knowing that the Queen's House was not far off, rode thither all alone, fearing nothing, because of his own Innocence, and supposing every one meant as honestly as himself.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Queen receives him with all the seeming kindness imaginable, and fain would have had him to light from his Horse, but he refusing that, and only asking to see his Brother, she caused some Drink to be presently brought him; but whilest the Cup was at his mouth, one of her Servants, privately before instructed, stabbed him
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93814:269"/>
with a Dagger in the Back.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dcccclxxviii.</note> He, exceedingly astonished at this unexpected ill treatment, clapp'd Spurs to his Horse, and fled away as fast as he could towards his Company; but the Wound being Mortal, and he spent with loss of blood, fell to the ground, and having one foot in the Stirrup, was dragged through By-ways; but being trac'd by his Blood by those she sent after him, they brought back the Dead Corps, which they buried privately at <hi>Werham,</hi> where they imagin'd they had also buried his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory as well as his Body; but the place of his Sepulture (as it's said) soon grew famous for Miracles.</p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Elfreda</hi> was upon this so convinced of her Wickedness, that from her Courtly and Delicate Way of Living, she betook her self to very severe Penances, as wearing Hair-cloath, sleeping on the ground without a Pillow, with such other Austerities as were used in that Age; and herein she continued all her life.</p>
               <p>So fell this good King <hi>Edward,</hi> after he had only born the Name of King Three years and an half; who for his Innocence, and the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles supposod to be wrought after his Death, obtained the Sirname of <hi>Martyr</hi>: Which opinion of his Sanctity was the more confirmed by other great Miseries which shortly after befel the Land; which the people did verily believe were inflicted on them for his Murther.</p>
               <p>This year (according to <hi>Florence)</hi> a strange Cloud appeared about Midnight all over <hi>England,</hi> being first seen of the Colour of Blood, then of Fire, and then like a Rainbow of divers Colours.</p>

                  <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library, relate; and was also Crowned King by the Archbishop <hi>Dunstan</hi> and <hi>Oswald,</hi> and ten other Bishops, at <hi>Kingston,</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Kal. May</hi>; he being (as <hi>R. Hoveden</hi> describes him) a Youth of a most Comely Aspect, but not being above Twelve Years of Age, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> gives us this short Character of Him and his Reign: That he rather distressed than governed the Kingdom for Seven and thirty years; that the course of his Life was cruel at the beginning, miserable in the middle, and dishonourable in the conclusion: To Cruelty he attributes the Death of his Brother, which he seemed to approve of, because he did not punish; he was remarkable for his Cowardice and Laziness; and miserable in respect of his Death. His Sluggishness was predicted by Archbishop <hi>Dunstan,</hi> when at his Christening he superadded his own Water to that of the Font; and thereupon <hi>Mat. Westminster</hi> makes him to swear, <hi>By God and St. Mary,</hi> this Boy will prove a Lazy Fellow: But all this looks like a Monkish Story, invented by those who did not love his Memory; since the same thing, though of somewhat a grosser nature is likewise related of the Emperor <hi>Constantine,</hi> from thence named <hi>Copronymus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet sure it was no sign of ill nature, if what <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and <hi>Bromton</hi>'s Chronicle relate, be true, That when he wept at the News of his Brother's Death, it put his Mother into such a violent Passion, that having not a Rod by her, she beat him so unmercifully with a Wax Taper which she then light upon, that he was almost dead; which caused in him such an aversion to Wax-Lights ever after, that he could never endure any such to be brought before him. But this sounds too Romantick, and therefore I leave it to the Reader's discretion what credit to give it.</p>
               <p>But to come to somewhat more certain and material; all Authors agree, that Archbishop <hi>Dunstan</hi> crown'd this King with great reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; yet he was forced to do it, as not having any of the Blood Royal fit to set up: But because the Monks will have their St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> to have had the Spirit of Prophecy (like the Prophets in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) they relate, that denouncing God's Judgments against this King at his Coronation, he said thus, <hi>Because thou hast aspired to the Kingdom by the Death of thy Brother, thus saith the Lord God, The Sin of thine Ignominious Mother shall not be expiated, neither the Sin of those that were her Counsellors, but by great Bloodshed of thy miserable People; for such Miseries shall come upon</hi> England, <hi>as it never underwent since it had that name.</hi> But this Doom was very unjust; for it is certain that the King never knew of, nor desired his Brother's Death; and it was very hard to denounce God's Judgments upon the whole Nation, for the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of one wicked Woman, and which was put in execution by but a few of her Accomplices: So that if the Nation was guilty of any fault,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93814:270"/>
it was only in so far conniving at the Crime,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> Dcccclxxviii.</note> as out of fear or partiality, to permit the Authors of it to pass unpunished; and for this the Bishops, they having then so great a sway in the whole Council of the Nation, had as much to answer for, as any of the <hi>Laity:</hi> But passing by God's Judgments, which are too deep for us to fathom, About this time (as the <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicles relate) <hi>Custenyn Dhu</hi> (i. e. <hi>Constantine</hi> the Black) Son to Prince <hi>Jago</hi> (then a Prisoner) hired <hi>Godfryd</hi> the <hi>Dane</hi> to bring his men against his Cousin <hi>Howel ap Jevaf,</hi> Prince of <hi>North-Wales</hi>; so joining their Forces together, they destroyed <hi>Anglesey</hi> and <hi>Lhyn:</hi> Whereupon Prince <hi>Howel</hi> gathered an Army, and setting upon the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Welshmen</hi> (who assisted them), at a place called <hi>Gwayth Horborth,</hi> routed them, and <hi>Constantine</hi> was slain.

                  <q>Archbishop <hi>Dunstan</hi> and <hi>Elfer</hi> the Ealdorman, having taken up the Body of King <hi>Edward,</hi> which lay buried at <hi>Werham,</hi> they carried and buried it at <hi>Scaeftesbyrig,</hi> (i. e. <hi>Sbaftsbury</hi>) with great Funeral Pomp.</q> The occasion of which Removal by <hi>Elfer,</hi> Earl of the <hi>Mercians</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Bromton</hi>'s Chronicle) was that old sign of an <hi>English Saxon</hi> Saint (so often repeated in this History) whether true or false, I shall not affirm; <hi>viz.</hi> a Column of Light streaming down from Heaven, over the place where his Body lay buried; as also, that when it was taken up out of the Grave, it was as whole and uncorrupt as when it was first buried three years before; whereupon having washed and dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it in new Cloathes, they buried it with great Solemnity at the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery above-mentioned, where his Sister <hi>Edith,</hi> the Daughter of King <hi>Edgar</hi> by <hi>Wulfritha</hi> the Nun, was then her self professed. But as for the strange Miracles which are here related to have been done at his Tomb, I willingly omit them. But <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> further adds about this Queen <hi>Elfreda,</hi> That she took upon her the Habit of a Nun at <hi>Werewell,</hi> a Nunnery which she lately founded, and there passed the rest of her days in great Austerities and Devotions: She also about the same time built another Nunnery at <hi>Ambresbury</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire</hi>; this being the usual way to expiate the most horrid Murthers in those dark times.</p>

                  <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> also takes notice of this, because they were so much talked of, as being the first that had invaded <hi>England</hi> after above 60 years intermission, and were only the forerunners of many more that follow'd: To which we may also refer that which is added by <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> under the year before, but should be put under this; That the same Fleet also wasted <hi>Taenetland,</hi> (that is, the Isle of <hi>Thanet</hi>); and the same year also the Province of <hi>Chester</hi> was much spoiled by the <hi>Norwegian</hi> Pyrates.</p>

               <p>About this time also, according to the same Author, <hi>Alfred</hi> and Eal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorman, or <hi>English</hi> Earl, joining (as the <hi>Welsh</hi> Manuscript Annals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late) with <hi>Howel</hi> the Son of <hi>Edwal,</hi> destroyed <hi>Brecknock,</hi> and spoil'd a great part of the Lands of <hi>Owen</hi> Prince of <hi>South-Wales</hi>; against whom <hi>Eneon</hi> the Son of the said <hi>Owen,</hi> and <hi>Howel</hi> King of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing an Army, met with them, and totally defeated them; so that the greatest part of Earl <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Army was slain, and the rest put to flight.</p>

because of some Dissentions between him and the Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> besieged that City, but not being able to take it, went and wasted the Lands of St. <hi>Andrew, (i. e.</hi> those belonging to that Bishoprick); but being commanded by the Archbishop to desist from his Fury, and not provoke the Saint to whom that Church is dedicated, the King despised his Admonition, till such time as he had an Hundred Pounds sent to him, and then he drew off his Forces; but the Archbishop abhorring his sordid Covetousness, is there said to have denounced fearful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against him, though they were not to be inflicted till after the Archbishop's death.</p>
               <p>This year, as the <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicles relate, <hi>Meredyth,</hi> Son to <hi>Owen</hi> Prince of <hi>South-Wales,</hi> entred <hi>North-Wales</hi> with what Forces he could raise, and slew <hi>Cadwalhon ap Jevaf</hi> in a Fight, together with <hi>Meyric</hi> his Brother, and conquered the whole Countrey to himself: Wherein we may observe how God punished the wrong which <hi>Jevaf</hi> and <hi>Jago</hi> did to their eldest Brother <hi>Meyric,</hi> who being disinherited, had his eyes put out; for first <hi>Jevaf</hi> was imprisoned by <hi>Jago,</hi> as <hi>Jago</hi> himself was by <hi>Howel</hi> the Son of <hi>Jevaf,</hi> and then this <hi>Howel,</hi> and his Brethren <hi>Cadwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon</hi> and <hi>Meyric</hi> were slain, and lost their Dominions.</p>

But the same Author last mentioned, writing from some other Copy of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, relates this Story another way; That this <hi>Goda</hi> being Earl of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> together with one <hi>Strenwald</hi> a valiant Knight, marching out to fight the <hi>Danes,</hi> they were both there killed; but there being more of them destroyed than of the <hi>English,</hi> the latter kept the field.

               </p>
               <p>This is that Great Archbishop, called St. <hi>Dunstan,</hi> who was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storer of the Monkish Discipline in <hi>England</hi>; and who made a Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ordinances for the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Order, by which he thought the Rule of that Order might be more strictly observed in all the Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>England.</hi>

But whilst <hi>Meredyth</hi> was thus taken up in <hi>South-Wales, North-Wales</hi> lay open to the <hi>Danes,</hi> who about this time arriving in <hi>Anglesey,</hi> destroyed the whole Isle.</p>
               <p>

                  </q> All which mischief <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> tells us was done by the <hi>Danes,</hi> whose Captains were <hi>Justin</hi> and <hi>Guthmund,</hi> when the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son abovementioned, fighting with them at <hi>Maldon,</hi> there was a great multitude slain on both sides, and the said Earl or Ealdorman was slain there; so that the <hi>Danes</hi> had the Victory.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The same year also (according to the Annals) it was first decreed, that Tribute should be paid to the <hi>Danes,</hi> because of the great Terror which they gave the Inhabitants of the Sea-Coast: The first Payment was Ten thousand Pounds; and it is said Archbishop <hi>Syric</hi> first gave this Counsel</q>
               </p>
               <p>To which also <hi>R.

               </p>
               <p>The former of them, <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> tells us had the year before consecrated the Abby Church of <hi>Ramsey,</hi> which the latter had newly founded; and as <hi>Florence</hi> adds, was buried in the Church of St. <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>Worcester,</hi> which he had newly built.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The same year also the King and all his Wise and Great Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, That all the stronger Ships should be got together at <hi>London</hi>; and the King made <hi>Ealfric</hi> and <hi>Thorod</hi> the Ealdormen, Admirals of this Fleet; as also <hi>Aelfstan</hi> and <hi>Aestwig,</hi> Bishops; commanding them that they should endeavour, if it were possible, to encompass the <hi>Danish</hi> Fleet; but <hi>Ealfric</hi> sent to them underhand, to take care of themselves; and the Night before they were to give Battel, he (to his perpetual Infamy) secretly withdrew himself from the King's to the <hi>Danish</hi> Fleet; so that all the <hi>Danes</hi> escaped by flight.</q> But <hi>Florence</hi> is more plain than the Annals in the Relation of this Flight; and tells us, that the King's Fleet immediately pursued them, and took one of their Ships,

               <p>The same year the Inhabitants of the Isle of <hi>Anglesey,</hi> having been cruelly harass'd by the <hi>Danes,</hi> and finding no Protection or Defence from <hi>Meredyth</hi> their Prince, then employed in other Wars (as you have already heard) they cast him off, and received <hi>Edwal ap Meyric,</hi> the right Heir of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> for their Prince, who better defended his Subjects from Foreign Invasions; for not long after, <hi>Meredyth,</hi> Prince of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> resolving again to recover so considerable a part of his Dominion, entring <hi>Anglesey,</hi> Prince <hi>Edwal</hi> with his Forces met him at <hi>Lhangwin,</hi> and routed him in a set Battel; so <hi>Theodor,</hi> or <hi>Tewdor Mawr,</hi> Nephew to Prince <hi>Meredyth,</hi> was there slain, and he himself forced to fly.</p>

                  <q>This year also (according to our Annals) <hi>Vnlaf,</hi> (or <hi>Anlaf</hi>) the <hi>Dane,</hi> came with Ninety three Ships as far as <hi>Stane,</hi> (now <hi>Staines</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the River <hi>Thames</hi>), and there wasted the Countrey round about; and from thence they went to <hi>Sandwic,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Gypswic,</hi> and spoiled all that Countrey.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But I suppose this is a Mistake in the <hi>Cambridge</hi> Copy of these An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; which repeat that Action of the <hi>Danes,</hi> together with the Death of Duke <hi>Bryghtnoth,</hi> which had been already said in the <hi>Laudean</hi> and <hi>Cottonian</hi> Copies to have happened <hi>Anno</hi> 991; and therefore what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, seems likewise misplaced in this Copy, concerning the Receiving and Baptizing of this King <hi>Anlaf,</hi> which it makes to be the effect of the Victory now obtain'd; for <hi>Anlaf</hi> was not baptized till the year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as will by and by appear.</p>
               <p>But this is more certain which comes after; <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That this year the Town of <hi>Bebanburgh</hi> (i.e. <hi>Banborow</hi> in <hi>Northumberland</hi>) was destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Danes,</hi> and a great Prey there taken; after which the <hi>Danes</hi> came up the River <hi>Humber,</hi> and did much mischief as well to those of <hi>Lindsige,</hi> as the <hi>Northumbers:</hi> Then were muster'd together a great number of Soldiers, but when they were going to give them Battel, they fled, the first Encouragers of their flight being their own Captains, <hi>Fraena, Godwin,</hi> and <hi>Frithegist</hi>; (all Three of the <hi>Danish</hi> Race.)</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This year also (according to the same Copy) King <hi>Ethelred</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Eyes of <hi>Ealfric</hi> the Ealdorman's Son, to be put out: But it does not tell us for what:</q> But <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> is more express, and says it was a Punishment for his Father's Perfidiousness; which if done now, was not only very unjust, to punish the Son for the Father's faults, but also ill tim'd, to do it so long after the Crime had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: But he further tells us, that he not only revolted once, but again; and so perhaps it was for this last Rebellion, that the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted this cruel Punishment upon his Son; for had the Father been in his power, it is most likely he would have made him to have suffer'd himself: But this being so much in the dark, I shall leave it to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make what he please on't.</p>
               <p>There having been for some time great Enmity between <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> which it seems had broke out into open War, Pope <hi>John</hi> sent <hi>Leo</hi> Bishop of <hi>Treve,</hi> as his Nuncio, first to the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; who having received the Pope's Letters, called a Council of all

the Great and Wise Men of the Nation; who agreed,<note place="margin">

               <p>About this time, according to the <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicles, <hi>Sweyn,</hi> the Son of <hi>Harold</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> having destroyed the Isle of <hi>Man,</hi> enter'd <hi>North-Wales,</hi> and slew <hi>Edwal ap Meyric</hi> in Battel: This Prince left behind him one Son, an Infant, who at last came to be Prince of <hi>Wales:</hi> So that it seems there was an Anarchy in <hi>North Wales</hi> for some time; unless <hi>Owen,</hi> formerly expell'd, now recover'd his Principality; which my Author does not mention.</p>

                  <q>But as they went off, they did as much mischief as any Army ever did, by burning and wasting the whole Countrey thereabouts, and killing all the Inhabitants in <hi>Essex, Kent,</hi> and <hi>Sussex,</hi> as also in <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire:</hi>
                  </q> And, as <hi>Florence</hi> relates, sparing neither Man, Woman, nor Child.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But at last they provided themselves with Horses, and riding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they pleased, did unspeakable Mischiefs: Whereupon it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the King and his <hi>Wise Men,</hi> That Messengers should be sent to them, promising them both Tribute and Provisions, if they would desist from their Spoil and Rapine: To which request they consented; and so the whole Army came to <hi>Hamtune,</hi> and there took up their Winter-Quarters; and in the mean time the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Kingdom was forced to maintain them; and Sixteen thousand Pounds were given to them, besides their maintenance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Then the King sent Bishop <hi>Elfeage</hi> to King <hi>Anlaf,</hi> as also <hi>Aethelward</hi> the Ealdorman; and leaving Hostages at the Ships, they brought <hi>Anlaf</hi> with great Honour to the King to <hi>Andefer,</hi> (that is, <hi>Andover</hi> in <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire)</hi>; then King <hi>Aethelred</hi> received him at his Confirmation, from the Bishop's hand; whereupon <hi>Anlaf</hi> promised him (which he also performed) that he would never again infest the <hi>English</hi> Nation.</q> And as <hi>Florence</hi> farther adds, he now returned into his own Countrey.</p>
               <p>So it seems the Kingdom was rid of <hi>Anlaf</hi>; but what became of <hi>Sweyen</hi> or <hi>Sweyn,</hi> the Annals do not tell us; for we hear no more of him till <hi>Anno</hi> 1004, as you will find by and by: So that whether he went away with <hi>Anlaf,</hi> or commanded those who infested the Kingdom the

But perhaps we may to this time refer that which <hi>Adam</hi> of <hi>Bremen</hi> relates of this King <hi>Sweyn,</hi> who having made <q>War upon his Father <hi>Harwold</hi> the Great, whom he outed of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Life together, was afterwards himself overcome, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled his Kingdom by <hi>Aerick</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi>; thus justly rewarded for his horrid Crimes, he wander'd up and down without relief. <hi>Thrucco</hi> the Son of <hi>Haco,</hi> then Prince of the <hi>Normans,</hi> rejected him as a Pagan; and <hi>Ethelred</hi> the Son of <hi>Edgar</hi> (he calls him <hi>Adalred)</hi> remembring what mischiefs the <hi>Danes</hi> had brought on <hi>England,</hi> with scorn repell'd him: So that at length he was entertained by the King of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who taking compassion on him, gave him free Quarter for Fourteen years together. But so enraged was he at the repulse given him by the King of <hi>England,</hi> that ever after he studied all he could how to plague and afflict that Countrey, one while by his own particular Forces, and another by the assistance of others.</q>
               </p>
               <p>How true this Story is, we cannot affirm; the Affairs of the <hi>Northern</hi> Nations, as to those Times, being involved in so great an obscurity: However, we thought it not amiss to give it you, as suiting with the Fortunes and Inclinations of this man, which proved so great a Plague to this our Countrey, that he seems to have been acted by some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Passion, whether of Ambition or Revenge, or both together.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Winter coming on, the <hi>English</hi> Forces return'd home, and the <hi>Danes</hi> about <hi>Martinmass</hi> retired to their old Sanctuary, the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> whither they carried whatever they had need of; and afterwards about <hi>Christmass</hi> they marched out to seek for fresh Provisions in <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunshire</hi> and <hi>Berrocseire,</hi> as far as <hi>Reading</hi>; and havocking according to their usual custom, burnt the Beacons whereever they found them; and from thence they marched to <hi>Wealingaford,</hi> (i. e. <hi>Wallingford)</hi> which Town they wholly destroyed: Then marching to <hi>Aescesdune,</hi> (now <hi>Aston,</hi> near <hi>Wallingford)</hi> they came to <hi>Cwicchelmeslaw,</hi> (now <hi>Cuckamsley-hill</hi> in <hi>Berkshire</hi>) without ever touching near the Sea; and at last return'd home another way.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>About the same time an <hi>English</hi> Army was mustered at <hi>Cynet,</hi> (i. e. <hi>Kennet</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire)</hi> where a Battel was fought, but the <hi>English</hi> Troops were immediately worsted; after which the <hi>Danes</hi> carried off all their Booty to the Sea-side. There might one have seen the <hi>Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> men (like a Cowardly sort of people) suffer the <hi>Danes</hi> to return to the Sea-side, even just by their doors, with their Provisions and Spoils. In the mean time the King marched over <hi>Thames</hi> into <hi>Scrob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besbyrigscire,</hi> (i. e. <hi>Shropshire)</hi> and there kept his <hi>Christmass.</hi> At that time the <hi>Danes</hi> struck so great a Terror into the <hi>English</hi> Nation, that no man could devise how to get them out of the Kingdom, nor how well to maintain it against them, because they had destroyed all the Countries of the <hi>West-Saxons</hi> with Burnings and Devastations. Then the King often consulted with his <hi>Wise Men</hi> about what was best to be done in this case, whereby they might save the Countrey before it was quite ruined; and after mature deliberation, it was at length decreed by them all, for the Common Good of the Nation, (though much against their wills) That Tribute should be again paid to the <hi>Danes.</hi> Then the King sent to their Army, to let them know, that he was contented to enter into a Peace with them, and to pay them Tribute, and also find them Provisions during their stay: To which Terms all the <hi>Danes</hi> assented: So it seems the whole <hi>English</hi> Nation was forced to maintain them.</q> And the beginning of the year following,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MVII.</note>
                  <q>This Tribute was again paid to them; to wit, Thirty thousand Pounds. Also the same year <hi>Aedric</hi> was made Ealdorman over all the Kingdom of <hi>Mercia.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Aedric,</hi> though he had married the King's Daughter, is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterized by all our Historians, for a Proud, False, and Unconstant Man; and who by his Treachery proved the Ruin of his Countrey, as well as of many particular Persons of great Worth: For not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, (as <hi>Florence</hi> relates) he made away <hi>Athelme</hi> that Noble Ealdor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> inviting him to a Feast, and afterwards carrying him out a hunting, where he hired the City-Hangman to set his Dog upon him, called <hi>Porthund,</hi> which tore him to pieces: And not long after his two Sons <hi>Walfheage</hi> and <hi>Vflgeat</hi> had their Eyes put out by the King's Order at <hi>Cotham,</hi> where he then resided.</p>

                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:93814:276" rendition="simple:additions"/>But we may hence observe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MVII.</note> to how sad a state the Nation was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced under a Voluptuous and Cowardly King, and a Degenerate Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: And the reason why the Annals say, <hi>That the People's being kept in Arms all the Winter, did them as much harm as the Enemy</hi>; was, because having then no standing Forces, the Countrey <hi>Militia</hi> were fain to be kept upon Duty at their own Charges, whilst their Families were ready to starve at home: <hi>So impossible a thing it is to maintain any long War either at home or abroad, without a Standing Army.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now the King having too late perceived his Error, <hi>viz.</hi> That the greatest Cause of his Ruin proceeded from the want of a good Fleet,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>He then commanded Ships to be built all over <hi>England</hi>;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MVIII.</note> (to wit) to every Hundred and ten Hides of Lands, one Ship; and of every Eight Hides a Helmet and Breast-plate:</q> And so by the next year,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>His Ships were all finished,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MIX.</note> and they were both so many and withal so good, that (as our Histories affirm) <hi>England</hi> never saw the like before: Then after they were all well mann'd and victual'd, they were brought to <hi>Sandwic,</hi> and there remain'd, in order to defend the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom against the Invasion of Strangers; yet notwithstanding all those Preparatives, the <hi>English</hi> Nation was so unhappy, that this great Fleet met with no better success than often before; for it happen'd about this time, or a little sooner, that <hi>Brightric</hi> (a false and ambitious man) the Brother of <hi>Aedric</hi> above mentioned, accused <hi>Wulfnoth</hi> a Thane of the <hi>South Saxons,</hi> (and Father of Earl <hi>Godwin)</hi> to the King; upon which <hi>Wulfnoth</hi> saving himself by flight, got together twenty Ships, and with them turning Pyrate, took Prizes all round the <hi>Southern</hi> Coast, and did a world of mischief; but as soon as it was told the King's Fleet, that they might easily surprize him if they would but cruise about that place, <hi>Brightric</hi> upon this taking Eighty Sail along with him, had mighty hopes by seizing of him either alive or dead, to make himself signally famous; but as he was sailing thither, so great a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest arose, as never had been in the memory of man, by which all his Fleet was shipwrack'd, or stranded on the shore; and <hi>Wulfnoth</hi> coming thither presently after, burnt all the rest that were left. Now when this News came to that part of the Fleet where the King was in Person, the whole Action seem'd to be undertaken very precipitately, without any good Advice at all. And thereupon the King with all his Ealdor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Great Men return'd home, leaving both the Ships and Men to shift for themselves: But those that were in them, carried them up to <hi>London.</hi> And thus did all the Labour and Expence of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion come to nothing, without in the least diminishing the Power of their Enemies as the people hoped they would have done.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>When all these Naval Preparations were thus defeated, there arrived presently after Harvest a mighty Fleet of <hi>Danes</hi> at <hi>Sandwic</hi>; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were landed they immediately marched to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which City they would forthwith have destroyed, had they not humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought a Peace of them: Upon which all the <hi>East Kentish</hi> men came and clapt up a Peace with the <hi>Danes,</hi> and purchased it at the Price of Three thousand Pounds: But these Heathens presently afterwards sail'd round again, till they came to <hi>Wihtland,</hi> (i. e. the <hi>Isle of Wight)</hi> and there, as also in <hi>Southseax, Hamtunscire,</hi> and <hi>Bearruscire,</hi> they plunder'd and burnt Towns as they used to do: Hereupon the King
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93814:277"/>
commanded the whole Nation to be summoned,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MIX.</note> that every Province should defend it self against them: But for all this, they still marched whereever they pleased, without any body's disturbing them: But one time when the King had hemm'd them in with his whole Army, as they were going to their Ships, and all his Forces were just ready to fall upon them, <hi>Aedric</hi> the Ealdorman hinder'd them, as he always did.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For, as <hi>R. Hoveden</hi> relates, he over persuaded the King by his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and plausible reasons, not to run the hazard of a Battel, but to let them go off if they would; and so they return'd to their Ships with a great deal of joy that they had so well got themselves out of that Toil.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Then after <hi>Martinmass</hi> they return'd again into <hi>Kent,</hi> and took up their Winter-Quarters near the <hi>Thames,</hi> fetching their Provisions from <hi>Essex,</hi> and those Provinces that lay nearest, on each side the River; and they frequently threatned the City of <hi>London,</hi> but (thanks be to God it had hitherto kept it self safe), there they met with always but an ill reception.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After <hi>Christmass</hi> they made an excursion through <hi>Cyltern,</hi> (that is, the <hi>Chiltern,</hi> or Woody Countrey of <hi>Bucks,</hi> and <hi>Oxfordshire</hi>) and so to <hi>Oxnaford,</hi> and burnt that City, and having plunder'd on both sides the <hi>Thames,</hi> they return'd to their ships; but when they heard that an Army was prepared ready against them at <hi>London,</hi> they again passed over the River at <hi>Stanes,</hi> and thus rambled about the Countrey all this Winter; yet about Spring they came again into <hi>Kent,</hi> and there refitted their ships.</q>

                  <q>But presently after <hi>Easter</hi> the <hi>Danish</hi> Army marched out against the <hi>English,</hi> and going on shore at <hi>Gypeswic</hi> (i. e. <hi>Ipswich</hi>) went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly thither, where they knew Earl <hi>Vlfkitel</hi> was encamp'd with his Forces; this happen'd on <hi>Ascension day</hi> in the morning; so the <hi>East-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> presently fled, and there were on the spot slain <hi>Ethelstan</hi> the King's Son-in-Law, as also <hi>Oswi</hi> and his Son, and <hi>Wulfric</hi> the Son of <hi>Leofwin,</hi> with many other Noble <hi>Thanes,</hi> and common Soldiers not to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred: One <hi>Thurkytel,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Myranheafod,</hi> (that is, in our present Language, <hi>Ant's-head</hi>) first began to fly, whereby the <hi>Danes</hi> kept the field; and having provided themselves with Horses, they subdued all <hi>East-England,</hi> spoiling and burning for three Months together, where they went; then marching into the <hi>Fens,</hi> they there destroyed both Men and Cattel, and burnt the Towns of <hi>Theodford</hi> and <hi>Grantabyrig,</hi> (i. e. <hi>Cambridge</hi>): Then turning <hi>Southward</hi> toward the <hi>Thames,</hi> they rode on Horseback to their ships; and presently coming out of them again, they marched towards the <hi>West</hi> into <hi>Oxnafordscire,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Buckinghamscire,</hi> and so along the River <hi>Owse,</hi> till they got as far as <hi>Bedanford</hi>; and thence to <hi>Temesanford</hi> (now <hi>Temsford</hi>), burning all the Towns in their way.</q>

But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our Annals.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>At last all the <hi>Wise Men</hi> of the Kingdom were again summoned by the King, to consult how they might better defend the Kingdom; but, it seems, whatsover was there resolved on, did not continue a month without alteration, till at last there were no Commanders that would raise any Forces, but every one fled away as fast as they could, neither would any one Shire help its Neighbours: Insomuch that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Feast of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> the <hi>Danish</hi> Army came to <hi>Hamtune,</hi> which Sea-Town they burnt, and took what Plunder they pleased in the Neighbourhood, and from thence again passed over the <hi>Thames</hi> into <hi>West-Seax,</hi> and thence into the Marshes of <hi>Kent,</hi> all which they wholly burnt and destroyed: And when they had thus marched where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they would, about <hi>Midsummer</hi> they returned again to their Ships.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge</hi> being both burnt this year by the <hi>Danes,</hi> all Studies ceased at each of these Places, till long after, as <hi>Thomas Rudburn</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, one <hi>Robert Bolean</hi> began to read his Lectures on the Scriptures, <hi>Anno</hi> 1133.

               </p>
               <p>But no wonder that things succeeded no better, if what <hi>Caxton</hi> in his Chronicle relates, were true concerning those Times; That when the Nobles met in the Great Council of the Kingdom, instead of consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the good of it, they fell to impeaching one another, and spent their whole time in their own private Quarrels; the Church-men stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their Privileges, refused to assist the King, or to contribute any thing considerable to the Publick Necessities: To all which mischiefs were likewise added Robberies, and Scarcity of Bread; which still en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the <hi>Danes,</hi> as they perceived the Kingdom grow weaker and weaker, to demand greater Tribute to buy their Peace; till at last the Kingdom was quite exhausted of all its Treasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This year the King and his <hi>Wise Men</hi> sent again to the <hi>Danish</hi> Army with desires of Peace, promising them both Provisions and Money;<note place="margin">

                  <q>They likewise took all in Holy Orders, both Men and Women; nor can it be told how many these were; after which they remain'd in the City as long as they pleased: But as soon as they had plunder'd it, they went back again to their Ships, carrying the Archbishop along with them; and he was now become a Captive, who but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the Spiritual Head of the <hi>English</hi> Nation: One might there have seen Misery at its full stretch, where used to be Joy and Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; even in that City from whence was first brought to us the joyful Tidings of the Gospel: But they detain'd the Archbishop Prisoner (near Seven Months) till such time as they martyr'd him.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Osbern</hi> in his Life of St. <hi>Elfeage,</hi> relates, That this Archbishop sent to the <hi>Danes</hi> when they came before the Town, desiring them to spare so many innocent Christians lives; but they despising his request, fell to battering the Walls, and so throwing Firebrands into the City, set it on fire; so that whilst the Citizens ran to save their Houses, <hi>Aelmeric</hi> the Archdeacon let the <hi>Danes</hi> into the City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florence</hi> here adds, That the Monks and Laity were decimated after a strange manner; so that out of every Ten Persons, only the Tenth was to be kept alive; and that only Four Monks and about Eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Laymen remain'd after this Decimation: And that not long after, above Two thousand <hi>Danes</hi> perished by divers inward Torments; and the rest were admonish'd to make satisfaction to the Bishop, but yet they obstinately refused it.</p>

But as soon as the Tribute was paid, and the Peace confirmed by Oath, the <hi>Danish</hi> Army was loosely dispersed abroad, being before closely compacted together; then Five and forty of their Ships submitted to the King, and promised him to defend the Kingdom, provided he would allow them Victuals and Apparel.</q>

                  <q>The year after Archbishop <hi>Aelfeage</hi> was thus martyr'd,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MXIII.</note> the King made one <hi>Lifing</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>: Also the same year, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Month of <hi>August,</hi> King <hi>Sweyn</hi> came with his Fleet to <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> and soon after sailing about <hi>East-England,</hi> arrived in the Mouth of <hi>Humber</hi>; and from thence up the River <hi>Trent,</hi> till they came to <hi>Gegnesburgh</hi> (now <hi>Gainsborough</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire</hi>).</q>
               </p>
               <p>Which mischief, according to <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> proceeded from <hi>Turkil</hi> a <hi>Dane,</hi> who was the great Inciter of the Death of the Archbishop, and who had then the <hi>East-English</hi> subjected to his will. This man sent Messengers into his own Countrey to King <hi>Sweyn,</hi> letting him know, that he should come again into <hi>England</hi>; for the King was given so much to Wine and Women, that he minded nothing else; wherefore he was hated by his Subjects, and contemned by Strangers; that his Commanders were Cowards, the Natives weak, and who would run away at the first sound of his Trumpets. Though this seems not very probable, for Earl <hi>Turkil</hi> was then of King <hi>Ethelred</hi>'s side, as you will see by and by.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Sweyn</hi> being prone enough to slaughter, needed no great Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to bring him over; he had been here eight years before, and why he stayed away so long, I wish our Authors would have told us: But <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> further adds, That one chief end of his coming over, was to revenge the death of his Sister <hi>Gunhildis,</hi> who being a Beautiful Young Lady, had come over into <hi>England</hi> with <hi>Palling</hi> her Husband, a powerful <hi>Danish</hi> Earl, and receiving the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, became her self a Hostage of the Peace that had been formerly concluded: But tho the unhappy Fury of <hi>Edric</hi> had commanded her to be beheaded together with some other of her Countreymen, yet she bore her Death with an undaunted Spirit, having seen her Husband, and a Son, a Youth of great and promising hopes, slain before her face. But to come again to our Annals:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>So soon as King <hi>Sweyn</hi> arrived in the <hi>North,</hi> Earl <hi>Vhtred</hi> and all the Countrey of the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> with all the people in <hi>Lindesige,</hi> and the people of the five <hi>Burghs</hi> or Towns (but what these were we now know not) lying on the other side <hi>Waetlingastreet,</hi> submitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to him. There were also Hostages given him out of every Shire; but when he found that all the people were now become sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him, he commanded them to provide his Forces both with Horses and Provisions, whilst he in the mean time marched toward the <hi>South</hi> with great expedition; committing the Ships and Hostages to <hi>Knute</hi> his Son: And after he had passed <hi>Waetlingastreet,</hi> they did as much mischief as any Army could do: Then they turn'd to <hi>Oxnaford,</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:93814:279"/>
whose Citizens presently submitted themselves to him;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MXIII.</note> from thence he went to <hi>Wincester,</hi> where the Inhabitants did the same; and from thence they marched <hi>Eastward</hi> towards <hi>London,</hi> near which many of his men were drown'd in the <hi>Thames,</hi> because they would not stay to find a Bridge; but when they came thither, the Citizens would not submit, but sallying out, had a sharp Engagement with them, because King <hi>Ethelred</hi> was there, and Earl <hi>Turkil</hi> with him: Wherefore King <hi>Sweyn</hi> departed thence to <hi>Wealingaford,</hi> and then over <hi>Thames Westward</hi> to <hi>Bathe,</hi> and there sate down with his whole Army, whither came to him <hi>Aethelmar</hi> the Ealdorman of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> with all the <hi>Western Thanes,</hi> who all submitted themselves to him, and gave him Hostages.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>When he had subdued all these places, he marched <hi>Northwards</hi> to his Ships, and then almost the whole Nation received and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for their real King: And after this the Citizens of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> became subject to him, and gave him Hostages, because otherwise they fear'd they should be utterly destroy'd; for <hi>Sweyn</hi> demanded that they should give full Pay and Victuals to his Army; and that Winter <hi>Thurkil</hi> demanded the same for King <hi>Ethelred</hi>'s Forces, which lay at <hi>Grenawic,</hi> (i. e. <hi>Greenwich).</hi> But both the Armies refrain'd not a jot the less from plundering where they pleased; so that the Nation both as well in the <hi>North</hi> as in the <hi>South,</hi> was no longer able bear it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After this the King stayed some time with his Fleet which lay then in the <hi>Thames,</hi> whilst the Queen retired beyond Sea to her Brother Earl <hi>Richard</hi> (in <hi>Normandy</hi>); and <hi>Elsige</hi> Abbot of <hi>Burgh</hi> went along with her; the King also sent thither the Princes <hi>Eadward</hi> and <hi>Aelfred,</hi> with Bishop <hi>Aelfune</hi> to be their Governor. Then the King went with his Fleet about <hi>Christmass</hi> into <hi>Wihtland,</hi> and there kept the Festival; and afterwards passed over to Earl <hi>Richard,</hi> and there stayed with him till <hi>Sweyn</hi> died.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>There is in the <hi>Peterburgh</hi> Copy of these Annals, this following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; That whilst the Queen thus remained beyond Sea, <hi>Elsige</hi> Abbot of <hi>Burgh,</hi> who was then with her, went to the Monastery called <hi>Boneval,</hi> where the Body of Saint <hi>Florentine</hi> lay buried: This place he found almost wholly deserted, and the poor Abbot and Monks in a miserable condition, having been robbed of all they had; then he bought of the Abbot and Monks the whole Body, except the Head, for Five thousand Pounds,<note place="margin">In the <hi>Saxon</hi> it is 500 <hi>l.</hi>
                     </note> and at his return into <hi>England</hi> dedicated it to <hi>Christ</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that is, he placed it in the Church of <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> of which he was then Abbot.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This was a vast Sum of Money in those days, to be given for the Bones of one dead Carkass, and not entire neither; but such was the Superstition of that Age.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This year King <hi>Sweyn</hi> ended his Life about <hi>Candlemas</hi>: Then all the <hi>Danish</hi> Fleet and Army chose <hi>Cnute</hi> his Son to be their King:<note place="margin">

Upon this the King sent Prince <hi>Edward</hi> his Son, and several others, Attendants, into this Kingdom, with Orders to recommend him to the whole Nation in his Name, promising them to be a faithful and kind Lord to them; and that he would redress whatever Grievances they had suffer'd, and would

               <p>
                  <q>Then a full and firm Amity being concluded on both by Words and Deeds, and Hostages being given on both sides, they decreed the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> King for ever banished <hi>England:</hi> After which King <hi>Ethelred</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd about <hi>Lent</hi> into his own Countrey, and was chearfully received by all men.</q>

               <p>The <hi>Bodleian</hi> Copy of <hi>Florence</hi> here adds, That Queen <hi>Elfgiva</hi> (or <hi>Emma)</hi> with the Two Young Princes her Sons, remained still in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> until she was (after the Death of her Husband) sent for over by King <hi>Cnute,</hi> and the Common-Council of the Kingdom, and being married to him, was solemnly crowned at <hi>Westminster,</hi> in the presence of all the Bishops and Great Men of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>After <hi>Sweyn</hi> was dead, <hi>Cnute</hi> his Son staid with his Army at <hi>Geg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesburgh</hi> until <hi>Easter,</hi> and there agreed with the people of <hi>Lindesige,</hi> that they should provide his Army with Horses, and then that all of them should march out together to plunder; but King <hi>Ethelred</hi> came thither with a strong Army before they were ready to execute their Design, and spoiled and burnt all places, killing all the men they could meet with; therefore King <hi>Cnute</hi> departed thence with his Fleet, leaving the poor miserable people to shift for themselves, and sail'd <hi>Southward</hi> till he came to <hi>Sandwic,</hi> and there put the Hostages on shore which had been given to his Father, having first cut off their Hands and Noses. But for an addition to all these Calamities, the King commanded Twenty one thousand Pounds to be paid to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that then lay at <hi>Grenawic.</hi>

                  <q>Also this year on the Vigil of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> happen'd a great Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sea all along this Coast, insomuch that it spread further than ever it had yet done, so that it drowned many Towns, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable company of men.</q>

               <p>We have nothing further to add under this year, more than to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the various Relations of our <hi>Monkish</hi> Writers concerning the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death of King <hi>Sweyn,</hi> which they will needs have to be a Judgment upon him for wasting the Lands belonging to the Monastery of <hi>Badri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesworth,</hi> and for giving opprobrious language against the Memory of St. <hi>Edmund,</hi> who was then enshrin'd. But because their Relation of this matter is very remarkable, I shall give you both <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> their Account of it; which is thus, That King <hi>Sweyn</hi> lying then at <hi>Gainsborough,</hi> there held a General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of his Great Officers; and when it grew toward evening, being encircled with his Armed Men, he cast out Threats, that he would send and spoil that Monastery; whereupon he presently thought he saw St. <hi>Edmund</hi> coming all Armed toward him, which made him cry out vehemently, <hi>Help, help, Fellow-soldiers, look here, King</hi> Edmund <hi>comes to kill me</hi>; and as he uttered these words, he received a Mortal Blow by the Saint's hands, and so fell from his Horse, and lying till the dusk of the evening in great torment, he expired on the second of <hi>February,</hi> and was carried to <hi>York,</hi> and there buried: So these Writers report from the Legend of St. <hi>Edmund:</hi> Yet <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Tinmouth</hi> makes St. <hi>Edmund</hi>'s Ghost to have stabbed him with his Dagger as he sate in his Chair. But <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> tells us, That St. <hi>Edmund</hi> appeared to him in his sleep, and smote him whilst he was in bed, because he answered him

But their Dependants, who went about to revenge their Lords death, were repulsed, and forced to fly into the Tower of St. <hi>Frideswide</hi>'s Church in <hi>Oxford,</hi> from whence, when they could not easily be driven, the Tower was set on fire, and they consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with it: But presently after, the King repenting of his Cruelty, caused the Church to be cleansed and repaired.</p>
               <p>This year also <hi>Lhewelyn ap Sitsylt,</hi> who was married to <hi>Angharat,</hi> only Daughter to <hi>Meredyth</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> (as you have already heard) raised great Forces against <hi>Aedan ap Blegored,</hi> the usurping Prince of <hi>North Wales,</hi> and fighting a bloody Battel with him, there slew him with his four Sons; but the place is not mentioned where this Fight was: After which, <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> took upon him the Principality of <hi>North Wales</hi> (for one <hi>Kynan,</hi> or <hi>Conan,</hi> then held <hi>South-Wales)</hi>; but though this <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> was descended by his Mother's side from <hi>Howel Dha,</hi> yet notwithstanding he was not the Lawful Heir of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> but <hi>Jago</hi> Son to Prince <hi>Edwal</hi> above-mentioned, who after the death of this <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> succeeded him, as you will hear in due time.</p>

Then <hi>Eadric</hi> having first gained over to him Forty of the King's Royal Navy, submitted to <hi>Cnute,</hi> as did also the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> and gave him Hostages, and provided Horses for his Army, and there he stay'd among them till <hi>Christmass.</hi>

                  <q>But after the Holidays were over, another Expedition was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, under a great Penalty upon every one that should not appear at the Muster, though he lived never so far off: And a Messenger was sent to the King at <hi>London,</hi> humbly beseeching him to come and meet the Prince's Army with all the Forces he could raise; but (it seems) when they were all got together, they signified no more than what they had often done formerly; for it was told the King that some in the Army conspired against him, whereupon he dismissed his Forces, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>London.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>So that whoever reads this History, may perceive that this King through his own Cowardise or Ill Fortune, was constantly attended with ill success where ever he went.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Then Prince <hi>Edmund</hi> rode down to the <hi>Northumbers</hi> to Earl <hi>Vhtred,</hi> and all men thought they were about to raise another Army against King <hi>Cnute,</hi> but they went into <hi>Staeford,</hi> and <hi>Scrobbesbyrig,</hi> and <hi>Legacester<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>scires,</hi> plundering in all places where they came; whilst <hi>Cnute</hi> did the like in his Quarters, marching through <hi>Buckingahamshire,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Bedafordshire,</hi> and so through <hi>Huntingtonshire</hi> over the Fens to <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Lincolnescire,</hi> and afterwards into <hi>Nottingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> and so into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> towards <hi>Eoforwic</hi> (i.e. <hi>York</hi>); which when <hi>Vhtred</hi> had heard, he desisted from spoiling the <hi>Northern</hi> Parts; and so being compell'd through necessity, submitted himself, together with all the <hi>Northumbers</hi>; and tho he gave Hostages, yet he was short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after slain (by King <hi>Cnute</hi>'s Orders), as was also <hi>Thurkytel</hi> the Son of <hi>Nafan</hi> (as <hi>Florence</hi> relates) by <hi>Thorebrand</hi> a certain Noble <hi>Dane</hi>; but, according to <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> it was done at the Command of <hi>Cnute</hi> himself.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After this, <hi>Cnute</hi> appointed <hi>Yric</hi> to be Earl of the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of <hi>Vhtred,</hi> and then returned <hi>Southward</hi> another way by the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern</hi> Coasts, so that his whole Army arrived at their Ships before

                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MXVI.</note> but <hi>Edmund Aetheling</hi> returned to <hi>London</hi> to his Father. After the Holidays King <hi>Cnute</hi> with all his Ships sail'd towards <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>; but it happened that before the <hi>Danish</hi> Fleet arrived there, King <hi>Ethelred</hi> deceased on the Feast of St. <hi>George,</hi> after he had suffer'd many Afflictions and Miseries in this life.]</q> And was buried at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Prince has the Ill Character from <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and the rest of our Historians, of being given to Wine and Women; and that neglecting the Company of the Queen his Wife, he debased the Royal Majesty by frequenting Mistresses of mean Quality, which very much alienated his Consort's Affections from him; though she had two Children by him, <hi>viz. Elfred</hi> and <hi>Edward.</hi> He is also said to have been Tyrannical to his own Subjects, taking away their Lives and Estates only for pretended Crimes. That he was also both Cowardly and Cruel, appears by that Barbarous Massacre of the <hi>Danes</hi> in time of Peace. But <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> says it was a wretched and miserable time; for every one was obliged to give up or murther his dearest Guests; nay, those whom a nearer Relation had yet render'd dearer to him. That this King was likewise Timerous and Unfortunate in all his Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, appears through the whole course of his Reign; from whence he has the Title among our <hi>English</hi> Historians, of <hi>Ethelred the Vnready,</hi> because his Preparations were always either ill-tim'd or unsuccessful; but as he was a mean-spirited Prince succeeding a Magnanimous Father, so Prince <hi>Edmund</hi> his Son and Successor equall'd his Grandfather King <hi>Edgar</hi> in Courage, tho not in good Fortune.</p>
               <p>But though King <hi>Ethelred</hi> was no Great or Worthy Prince in his own Person, yet with the Assistance of his <hi>Wites</hi> or <hi>Wise Men</hi> of his <hi>Great Council,</hi> he made divers excellent Laws and Constitutions. There are in <hi>Bromton</hi>'s Chronicle four several Bodies of these Laws, made at as many several times, and in divers places, whereof there are only two extant among the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws published by Mr. <hi>Lambard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Laws comprized in the first Division are Six, there said to have been made at <hi>Woodstock</hi> in <hi>Mercia,</hi> for the restoration of Peace according to the Law of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first is, That every Freeman shall find Sureties to be bound for him, that he shall do right in case he be accused.</p>
               <p>The second I shall omit, since it hath been already mentioned in the Laws of King <hi>Edgar</hi>; only the latter end of it is very remarkable; to wit, The Lord shall answer for his whole Family, and be <hi>Surety</hi> for the appearance of every Person in it. And if any of his Servants after they are accused, run away, the Lord or Master shall pay his man's <hi>Were</hi> to the King: And if the Master be accused as the Adviser to, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter of his Escape, he shall purge himself by five <hi>Thanes</hi>; and if he do it not, he shall pay to the King his <hi>Were,</hi> and his man shall be an Outlaw.</p>
               <p>The Third ordains, That a Bondman being cast by the <hi>Ordeal,</hi> shall be marked with a Hot Iron for the first Offence; and being cast in the same manner the second time, shall be put to Death. Which Law bears some resemblance to our present Law or Custom, whereby <hi>Clergy</hi> is allowed for the first Crime committed.</p>
               <p>By the fifth the King's Reeve or Officer is obliged to require Sureties for the good behaviour of such as are of ill fame amongst all men;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93814:281" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which if such a one obstinately refuses to give, he is to be put to death,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MXVI.</note> and to be buried in an unhallowed place with Malefactors: And if any use force in his behalf to further his Escape, he is to undergo the same Punishment.</p>
               <p>As for the next Set of Laws, they are said to have been made at <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> or <hi>Wanating</hi> (now <hi>Wantage</hi> in <hi>Berkshire</hi>), and for the increase of common Peace and Happiness by King <hi>Ethelred</hi> and his Wise Men.</p>
               <p>The first of them is concerning the keeping of the King's Peace, as it was in the days of his Predecessors, and for the punishment of the breach of it, in case of Manslaughter: If it were in a <hi>Gemot</hi> or Assembly of five Boroughs, with the forfeiture of five Pounds weight in Silver: If in an Assembly of a Borough or Town, by a Mulct of Seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred (Shillings). [But how much this was, is not known; for we have not now any true account of the Standard of Money at that time.] If in a <hi>Wapentake,</hi> by One hundred; and if in an Ale-house a man be killed, with six half Marks; if he be not killed, with twelve <hi>Oares</hi>; for the Value of which, <hi>Vid.</hi> Sir <hi>Hen. Spelman</hi>'s Gloss.</p>
               <p>From hence (but especially from the Laws of King <hi>Ina</hi>) we may observe, how Ancient the Liquor of Ale, and Ale-houses, have been in <hi>England,</hi> as also (what commonly follows it) quarrelling, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Peace in such places.</p>
               <p>The fourth commands, That Publick Meetings be observed in every Hundred or Wapentake; and that Twelve <hi>Thanes,</hi> (says <hi>Bromton)</hi> or Twelve Men of free condition, (as <hi>Lambard</hi> reads it) being Elderly Men, together with their <hi>Praepositus</hi> (or Chief) shall swear upon the Gospels or Holy Reliques, That they will neither condemn an Innocent Person, nor acquit a Guilty One.</p>
               <p>From whence we may observe the Antiquity of Trials by a Grand Inquest of more than Twelve Men, even in the <hi>English Saxon</hi> times, and was not introduced by <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> as <hi>Polydore Virgil,</hi> an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> not much skill'd in the Antiquities of this Island, hath delivered in his History.</p>
               <p>And to confirm what we have here said, the Third Chapter of the League betwixt King <hi>Alfred,</hi> and <hi>Guthrun</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> very much maketh out, which orders, <hi>That if the King's</hi> Thane <hi>or Servant be accused of Homicide, he shall purge himself (if he dare) by twelve other</hi> Thanes: Which you may see at large in those Laws themselves; and besides these the Reader throughout the whole Collection of <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, there is frequent mention made of clearing and purging by so many men summoned for that purpose, as sometimes by twelve, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by fewer, and sometimes by more.</p>
               <p>As for the Trial by <hi>Ordeal,</hi> it grew more in request in the Reign of King <hi>Cnute,</hi> and his Successors, being indeed originally a <hi>Danish</hi> Custom.</p>
               <p>The rest of the Laws of King <hi>Ethelred</hi> made at <hi>Wantage,</hi> having many of them relation to this way of Trial by <hi>Ordeal,</hi> and containing many obscure terms, I omit. But since several of them may very well be referred to other former Laws, I shall only select from amongst them, such as are most worthy to be taken notice of here.</p>
               <p>The twenty third appoints what Custom should be paid by Ships and Vessels of all sorts that unladed at <hi>Billinggesgate</hi>; from whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that this was the Ancient Port of <hi>London,</hi> Wines and all other Commodities being here unladed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:93814:282"/>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MXVI.</note>The twenty sixth imposes the same Punishment upon such as witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive, as well as on those that make Bad Money.</p>
               <p>Whereby we may observe, That though the Coining of Bad Money was not as yet made Treason, yet it was punishable at the King's discretion, either by Fine or Death, as you will see in the following Law.</p>
               <p>The twenty eighth puts it into the King's power, whether to fine or put to death such Merchants as import Counterfeit Money: And further imposeth upon all Port-reeves that shall be accessary, the same Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as upon those that coin false Money, except the King think fit to pardon them.</p>
               <p>There are also other Laws which we cannot certainly affirm to have been made in his time, though the general Conjecture is that they were. These are comprised in an Agreement or Act which the <hi>Wise Men</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and the Counsellors of <hi>Wales</hi> made, concerning the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Mountains of that Countrey: But as for the particular Laws made in this Common-Council of both Nations, since they only concern Cattel or other Goods taken away on either side, or else the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of giving Testimony both by <hi>Welsh</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Witnesses in such cases, I refer the Reader to the Laws themselves; and shall only desire him to take notice, That Justice was to be equally administred by Twelve Judges, Six <hi>Welsh</hi> and Six <hi>English</hi> men, much after the same manner as the Commission for the Borders of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> is now executed.</p>
               <p>But that we may see how great a distance there was then between these two Nations (which, God be thanked, are now united into one) the sixth Article of these Laws expresly forbids the <hi>Welsh</hi> to come into <hi>England,</hi> or the <hi>English</hi> to enter <hi>Wales,</hi> except received at either Bank by the Borderers, who shall take care for their safe conduct and return: And in case any Borderer be accused of false dealing herein, and cannot by witness disprove it, he should be fined.</p>

                     <hi>De Genealog: Reg. Ang.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Ethelred</hi> Abbot <hi>de Rievallis,</hi> saith she was the only Daughter of <hi>Toret</hi> a Noble <hi>Earl,</hi> whom the Chronicle of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Wallingford</hi> calls <hi>Ethelred</hi>'s first Wife: But <hi>Mat. Westminster</hi> relates otherwise, that he was not born of Queen <hi>Emma,</hi> who was his only Wife, but of a certain Ignoble Woman; yet besides the Obscurity of his Birth, he was a Man without all exception, both for Strength of Body and Mind, and therefore called by the <hi>English, Ironside.</hi> He would have made amends both for his Father's Cowardise, and his Mother's want of Birth, had he been but allowed some longer time to have lived. So that it appears by these Authors, that this King <hi>Edmund</hi> was born of a Concubine.</p>
               <p>But to come to our History: <q>When King <hi>Edmund</hi> was thus declared King at <hi>London</hi> (as <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> tells us) with great Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Joy, he also relates, That many of the Bishops, Abbots, and Noblemen of <hi>England</hi> coming to <hi>Southampton,</hi> abjuring the Progeny of King <hi>Ethelred,</hi> at the same time chose <hi>Cnute</hi> for their King; who (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Annals) immediately came with his Fleet to <hi>Grenawic,</hi> about <hi>Lent,</hi> and within a short time after marched up to <hi>London,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MXVI.</note> where they dug a great Trench on the <hi>South</hi>-side of the River, and drew their Ships to the <hi>West</hi>-side of the Bridge, and besieged the City, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that none could go in or out, making such frequent Assaults upon it; yet the Citizens resisted them vigorously: But King <hi>Eadmund</hi> was marched out before into <hi>West-Saxony,</hi> where all that Nation willingly submitted themselves to him. Not long after, he fought with the <hi>Danes</hi> at <hi>Peonnan</hi> (now <hi>Pen)</hi> near <hi>Gillingam</hi> (in <hi>Somersetshire.)</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Cnute</hi> not being there, they do not tell us who commanded in his stead, for he was then with his Fleet at the Siege of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'After <hi>Midsummer</hi> King <hi>Eadmund</hi> fought another Battel at <hi>Sceorstan</hi> (which place is supposed to be a Stone that now parts the four Counties of <hi>Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Worcestershire,</hi> and <hi>Warwickshire</hi>): But our Annals do not mention who had the Victory; only, <q>That there were many kill'd on both sides, and that the two Armies marched off from each other of their own accord; for <hi>Eadric</hi> the <hi>Ealdorman,</hi> and <hi>Aelmer,</hi> then joined with the <hi>Danes</hi> against King <hi>Edmund.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> tells us, <hi>Eadric</hi> the Traytor was the cause of the King's Soldiers running away; for holding up his Sword dipped in the Blood of some mean person, (or as <hi>Simeon</hi> says, his Head, which was very like King <hi>Edmund</hi>'s) whom he had newly killed, he cried out to the <hi>English,</hi> to fly, for their King was dead: Yet <hi>R. Hove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> adds, That the Fight was very bloody, and both Parties were forced to leave off, being quite tired.</p>

                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MXVI.</note>
                  <q>Our Annals do then thus proceed, That King <hi>Edmund</hi> having gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Army the third time, march'd to <hi>London,</hi> and raised the Siege, driving the <hi>Danes</hi> to their Ships, and within two days after the King passed over at <hi>Brentford,</hi> and there fought the <hi>Danes,</hi> and put them to flight; but many of the <hi>English</hi> were drrown'd by their own ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence, as they ran before the Army, being greedy of spoil.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After this the King marched down toward the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> and there reinforced his Army; whilst in the mean time the <hi>Danish</hi> Forces returned to <hi>London,</hi> and besieged that City, assaulting it both by Land and Water, but God at that time also delivered it; whereupon the <hi>Danes</hi> departed from <hi>London</hi> with their Ships into <hi>Arwan,</hi> and there landing marched up into <hi>Mercia,</hi> killing and burning all they met with, according to their old custom, and there furnished themselves with Provisions, and then drew all their Ships with their Spoil up the <hi>Medway.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But where this <hi>Arwan</hi> abovementioned lay, is very uncertain; That it could not be the River <hi>Arrow</hi> in <hi>Warwickshire</hi> (as some fancy) is plain, that being no where Navigable: Therefore the <hi>Ingenious</hi> Editor of these <hi>Annals,</hi> in the explication of the Proper Names of Places at the end of the Book, does very probably guess, that this River was either that which we now call <hi>Orwell,</hi> which divides <hi>Essex</hi> from <hi>Suffolk</hi>; or else that there is an Error in the <hi>Saxon Copy,</hi> and instead of <hi>into Arwan,</hi> it should be read <hi>to Waran,</hi> that is, they went up the River <hi>Lee</hi> as far as <hi>Ware:</hi> But this I leave to the Reader's Judgment, and shall again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Annals themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Then King <hi>Eadmund</hi> assembled the whole <hi>English</hi> Nation a fourth time, and passed the <hi>Thames</hi> again at <hi>Brentford,</hi> and from thence went into <hi>Kent,</hi> and there put the <hi>Danish</hi> Horse to flight in <hi>Seapige,</hi> and killed as many of them as they could meet with: But <hi>Eadric</hi> the Eal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorman by his subtle Artifices persuaded the King to stay at <hi>Aeglesford,</hi> which was the most perfidious advice that could be given him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> are more particular in this Transaction; and say, That the Traitorous Earl above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so over-persuaded the King by his plausible Insinuations, that he did not pursue the <hi>Danes,</hi> when almost routed, or else he might have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an absolute Victory.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Then (according to our Annals) the <hi>Danes</hi> turned against the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> and marched into <hi>Mercia,</hi> killing all before them; but when the King understood that the <hi>Danes</hi> were gone thither, he drew all the <hi>English</hi> Forces together the fifth time, and following them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the Rear, overtook them near a Hill called <hi>Assandun</hi> (now <hi>Ashdown</hi> in <hi>Essex</hi>), where they had a very sharp Engagement; but there <hi>Eadric</hi> the Ealdorman playing his old pranks, first of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the flight with the <hi>Magesaetons,</hi> by <hi>Cambden</hi> supposed to be the <hi>Radnorshire</hi> men; and so once more deceived his Natural Lord, and the whole Nation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But here, though I cannot but admire the wonderful Courage and Constancy of this Brave Prince, yet can I not commed his Prudence, who could thus trust a known Traytor, that had not only betrayed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but his Father before him: But I need make no long reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, since we find few Princes guilty of the like Easiness in later Ages.</p>

                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MXVI.</note> That <hi>Cnute</hi> now obtained the Victory against the greatest part of the <hi>English</hi> Nation; and there were slain on the spot <hi>Eadnoth</hi> the Bishop, and <hi>Wilfsige</hi> the Abbot, <hi>Aelfric</hi> and <hi>Godwin</hi> the Ealdormen, and <hi>Wulfkytel</hi> Earl of <hi>East-England,</hi> and most of the <hi>English</hi> Nobility.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> highly commends this <hi>Wulfkytel,</hi> and says that he deserved perpetual Honour, because he was the first in the time of <hi>Sweyn,</hi> who set upon the <hi>Danish</hi> Pyrates, and gave some hopes that they might be conquered. But as for <hi>Eadnoth</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and the Abbot above-mentioned, they came not to fight, but as <hi>Simeon</hi> says, to pray to God for those that did; so that the <hi>English</hi> Nation never yet received a greater Blow.</p>
               <p>But King <hi>Edmund</hi> being left almost alone, got to <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and there rallied and recruited his shatter'd Troops; but thither (according to our Annals) <q>King <hi>Cnute</hi> with all his Army pursued him: Then <hi>Eadric</hi> the Ealdorman, and all the Great Men on both sides advised the Two Kings to come to Terms of Peace: Whereupon they both met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Olanege</hi> (an Island in the River <hi>Severn,</hi> now called the <hi>Eighth)</hi> and there concluded a League between them (Hostages and Oaths being mutually exchanged) and agreed, That the <hi>Danish</hi> Army should be paid.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A Peace being thus concluded, the two Kings parted from each other, <hi>Eadmund</hi> going into <hi>West-Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Cnute</hi> to the <hi>Mercians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But since other Authors have more particularly related the Cause and Manner of making this Peace, I shall give you a larger account of it from <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> and <hi>R. Hoveden</hi>; the first of whom says, That the Traytor <hi>Edric</hi> and some others, when King <hi>Edmund</hi> would have fought again with <hi>Cnute,</hi> would by no means suffer him to do it; but advised him rather to make a Peace, and divide the Kingdom with him; to whose Persuasions the King at last (though unwillingly) consented; and Messengers passing between them, and Hostages being interchanged, the two Kings (or rather, their Commissioners, as <hi>Bromton</hi>'s Chronicle relates it) met at a place called <hi>Deorhurst,</hi> on the <hi>Severne,</hi> and there concluded a Truce. Then King <hi>Edmund</hi> with his men being on the <hi>West</hi> side <hi>Severne,</hi> and <hi>Cnute</hi> with his Followers sitting down on the <hi>East</hi> side thereof, they passed over in Ferry-boats to the Island above-mentioned, where they met, and agreed upon the Terms of Peace.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Ethelred</hi> Abbot of <hi>Rieval,</hi> tells the Story somewhat different, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That both Armies growing weary of the War at last, compelled the Great Men on each side to come to a Conference, where one of the most Elderly among them is brought in making a long Speech, (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to shew the Wit of those Authors); and therein he very pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically represents the Mischiefs the Soldiers lay under, in thus exposing their Lives and Fortunes for Two Princes of equal Courage; and so advised them before it was too late, That since King <hi>Edmund</hi> could not endure a Superior, nor <hi>Cnute</hi> an Equal, they should leave it to them two to fight by themselves for that Crown which they both so much desired to wear; left by this desperate way of fighting, the Soldiers should be all kill'd, and then there would be none left to defend the Nation against Foreign Invaders.</q> Which Speech being highly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of by all there present, both Armies cried out with one voice,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93814:284"/>
                  <hi>Let them either Fight,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MXVI.</note> 
                  <hi>or Agree:</hi> This Sentence of the Chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders and Soldiers being brought to both the Kings, pleased them so well, that they met in the Island above-mentioned, and there fought singly in the sight of both Armies; where having broken their Spears, and then drawn their Swords, there follows in these Authors a long and Tragical Relation of this mighty Combat, which yet it seems happened without any Wounds on either side; but <hi>Cnute</hi> beginning at last to be out of breath, and fearing the greater Strength and Youth of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi> proposed a Peace to be made by division of the Kingdom between them; and they give us also the fine Speech made by King <hi>Cnute</hi> upon this Subject; which Proposal being willingly received by King <hi>Edmund,</hi> they kissed and embraced each other, both Armies wondering and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for joy at this so happy and unexpected agreement. So mutually changing both their Arms and Apparrel in token of Friendship, they each return'd to their own men, and there drew up the Conditions of the League; <hi>viz.</hi> That King <hi>Edmund</hi> should enjoy <hi>West-Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Cnute</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Mercia</hi>; but what was to become of the rest of <hi>England,</hi> they do not speak one word.</p>
               <p>But tho so many of our Writers seem pleas'd with this Romantick Story, yet I rather assent to the Testimony of our <hi>Annals,</hi> and the <hi>Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Emmae,</hi> as also <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury, Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and several Manuscript Authors in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library, who all agree this Peace to have been made at the place aforesaid, without any Combat at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Kings: Only <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> relates, that when King <hi>Edmund</hi> had challenged <hi>Cnute</hi> to fight with him single, to save the further Effusion of their Subjects Blood, this Challenge being carried to King <hi>Cnute,</hi> he utterly declined it, saying, Though he had as great a Courage as his Antagonist, yet he would not venture his own small Body against a man of so great Strength and Stature; but since both their Fathers had enjoyed a share of the Kingdom, it was more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to prudence to divide it between them: Which Proposal being joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully received by both Armies, as a thing most just and equal in it self, and which most tended to the good of both Nations, now harass'd out by long and cruel Wars, King <hi>Edmund</hi> accepted of, and agreed (though with some reluctancy) to a Peace, upon the terms above-mentioned. Thus we find what a great uncertainty there is in most of the Relations of those times. But to proceed with our <hi>Annals:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>Danes</hi> as soon as this Peace was concluded, went to their Ships with all the Plunder they had taken, and from thence fail'd to <hi>London,</hi> and there took up their Winter-Quarters.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For that City, as being part of the <hi>Mercian</hi> Kingdom, had now sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it self to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Not long after this, <hi>viz.</hi> at the Feast of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> King <hi>Eadmund</hi> departed this life, and was buried with his Grandfather King <hi>Eadgar</hi> at <hi>Glaestingabyrig.</hi> The same year also deceased <hi>Wulfgar</hi> in <hi>Abbandune,</hi> whereof he was Abbot, and <hi>Aethelsige</hi> succeeded him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But since our <hi>Annals</hi> tell us only of the sudden Death of this Prince, without relating the manner of it, we shall give it you more at large from other Authors, who almost generally agree, that he was murthered by that Traytor <hi>Edric,</hi> though they differ somewhat in the Actors or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments by whom it was committed; some will have him to be taken off by Poyson; others, with an Arrow shot by an Image made on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,

which discharged it self upon the King as soon as he touched it;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MXVI.</note> but this is too improbable to beget any credit: And therefore what <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and <hi>Bromton,</hi> relate, is most likely to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> That this <hi>Aedric</hi> above-mentioned suborned two of this King's Servants to lye under the House-of-Office, and to thrust up a sharp piece of Iron into his Fundament, as one night he sate down to ease himself. Tho the Chronicle last-mentioned says this Murther was committed at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> by one of <hi>Edric</hi>'s Sons, who at the command of his Father stabbed him in the Hinder Parts with a long sharp Knife, and left the Weapon sticking in his Body. But <hi>H. Huntington,</hi> and <hi>Alred</hi> Abbot of <hi>Rievalle,</hi> say that <hi>Edric</hi> was the first who saluted <hi>Cnute</hi> Sole King of all <hi>England</hi>; to whom when he had told all the matter, the King answer'd <hi>Well, for so great a Good Turn, I will advance thy Head above all the Lords in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and thereupon commanding him to be beheaded, order'd his Head to be set upon the Tower of <hi>London</hi>: But this being related by no other Author besides <hi>Mat. Westminster,</hi> is not probable; for all others make him to have been alive some time after this. But <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>R. Hoveden,</hi> do with greater certainty relate, That as soon as he received the News of <hi>Edmund</hi>'s Death, he order'd all the Bishops, Ealdormen, and Chief Men throughout <hi>England,</hi> to be summoned to <hi>London,</hi> and when they appeared before him, he cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly asked them, If they were Witnesses of the Agreement which had been made between him and King <hi>Edmund,</hi> concerning the Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Kingdom; and whether there was any Condition inserted, That either his Sons or his Brethren should succeed him in the Kingdom of the <hi>West-Saxons?</hi> Then they all began with one accord to say, They did not know that King <hi>Edmund</hi> had left any part of the Kingdom to his Brethren, either living or dying; but as for his Sons, they knew very well that <hi>Edmund</hi> would have left him to be the Protector of his Children, till they should come of fitting age to reign: But they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise add, that they bore false witness, and lied grosly, because they hop'd to make King <hi>Cnute</hi> the more favourable to them, and should thereby receive the greater Rewards for their pains: But some of them had a just Recompence for their Perjury, by being not long after put to death. Hereupon King <hi>Cnute</hi> after he had thus taken their Testimonies, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Oaths of Fidelity from the said Great Men and Bishops, who all swore that they would chuse him for their King, and willingly raise Taxes to pay his Army; and at the same time also they renounced the Sons of King <hi>Edmund, (Edward</hi> and <hi>Edmund</hi>) from ever being Kings of this Nation.</p>
               <p>But King <hi>Cnute</hi> growing jealous of these Young Princes, sent them to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> that they might by him be made away; which he out of compassion not only refused, but generously sent them to <hi>Solomon</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> to be educated; and being there kindly received for some time, <hi>Edmund</hi> the elder of them died, but <hi>Edward</hi> the younger marrying <hi>Agatha</hi> the Queen's Sister, had by her <hi>Edgar,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Aetheling, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stina</hi> a Nun, and <hi>Margaret,</hi> afterwards married to <hi>Malcolme</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi>; of whom we shall have occasion to speak further, before we come to the end of this Book.</p>

                  <q>THis year (according to our <hi>Annals) Cnute</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi> began to reign over all <hi>England,</hi> which he divided into four Parts or Governments, reserving <hi>West Saxony</hi> to himself, committing <hi>East-England</hi> to Earl <hi>Thurkyl, Mercia</hi> to <hi>Eadric,</hi> and the <hi>Northumbers</hi> to <hi>Yric</hi>; but not long after, the said <hi>Eadric</hi> the Ealdorman was killed:</q> The manner of which <hi>Bromton</hi>'s Chronicle thus relates, That at <hi>Christmass</hi> the King being at <hi>London,</hi> in a certain upper room on the other side of the <hi>Thames,</hi> it happened that the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Eadric</hi> upbraided the King with his services, How that for his sake he had betrayed King <hi>Ethelred,</hi> and also made away <hi>Edmund</hi> his own King, and yet he had received no very extraordinary advantage or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereby, according to his Merits, (to be sure, as he himself thought); at which <hi>Cnute</hi> being highly enraged, answered, <hi>Out of thy own mouth shalt thou be judged, who plainly confessest thy self a Traytor against both thy former Kings, therefore thou shalt certainly dye</hi>: So he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately commanded him to be tied hand and foot, and flung out of the Window into the River; though some other Authors relate that he was first strangled: But we cannot find for certain which way it was done; for <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> and <hi>R. Hoveden</hi> only say this, That the King commanded <hi>Eadric,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Streon,</hi> to be slain in the Palace, because he was afraid of being circumvented by his Treacheries; and ordered likewise his Body to be flung over the Wall of the City, and there to lye unburied.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Annals</hi> do here further add, <q>That <hi>Northman</hi> Son to Earl <hi>Leofwin,</hi> and <hi>Aethelward</hi> Son to <hi>Aethelmaer</hi> the Great, and <hi>Brihtric</hi> Son to <hi>Aelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> Earl of <hi>Defenanscire,</hi> were also put to death; but their Crimes are not set down:</q> Therefore <hi>R. Hoveden</hi> supposes them to have been only the King's Jealousy of their too great Power, being all <hi>English</hi> Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, though I suspect they were guilty of somewhat more than what we find related.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The same year also the King banished <hi>Eadwig Aetheling,</hi> called <hi>Ceorles Cyng,</hi> (i.e. King of the Clowns) Brother to King <hi>Eadmund.</hi>
                  </q> But the Annals seem to make this <hi>Eadwig</hi> two persons, though for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son I know not; but however he was not immediately banished after <hi>Cnute</hi> came to the Crown, as some Writers suppose; neither yet was he put to death, as <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> and <hi>Bromton,</hi> relate; for the latter tells us this Story of him, That <hi>Cnute</hi> not thinking himself safe so long as <hi>Edwig</hi> was alive, consulted with Earl <hi>Eadric</hi> how to have him dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the way; by whose advice the King sent for one <hi>Ethelward,</hi> and tempted him privately with large Rewards; but he abhorring in his heart so foul a deed, however promised to do it as soon as he found a fitting opportunity, and by this means still deferred it. But then the same Author adds, That having by the said <hi>Eadric</hi>'s Counsel ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished Prince <hi>Edwin,</hi> the year following, under a feign'd Reconciliation, he was by King <hi>Cnute</hi>'s Order made away; which is contrary to what

                  <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> relates; for he says that this Prince,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Annals</hi> further say, <q>That before the <hi>Kal.</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> the King commanded Queen <hi>Emma,</hi> Widow of the late King, his Predecessor, to be brought over to him, and some time after took her for his Consort.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This he did to gain the Friendship of the Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but she is highly censured for marrying the sworn Enemy of her Husband and her Children: Though this only let us see that it is no new thing for Princes to prefer the wearing of a Crown even before their own Honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now again (according to our Annals) was paid that Tax or Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute called <hi>Danegelt,</hi> throughout all the <hi>English</hi> Nation, to wit,<note place="margin">

                  </q> Eleven thousand Pounds more. Which Tax being raised when there seemed to be no more fear of the <hi>Danes,</hi> it looks as if King <hi>Cnute</hi>

                  </gap> took upon him to govern as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. From which also you may observe the flourishing Trade and Wealth of that City in those days, since it could even at that time pay above a Seventh of this excessive Taxation.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Then also a great part of the <hi>Danish</hi> Army return'd into <hi>Denmark,</hi> and only forty Ships remain'd with King <hi>Cnute</hi>; the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> were likewise now reconciled and united at <hi>Oxnaford:</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>Bromton</hi> says it was done at a Great Council or Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where King <hi>Cnute</hi> ordained the Laws of King <hi>Edgar</hi> (i. e. of <hi>England)</hi> to be observed.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The same year also <hi>Aethelsige,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Abbandune</hi> deceased, and <hi>Aethelwin</hi> succeeded him.</q>

                  <hi>Bromton</hi>'s Chronicle says he went over to subdue the <hi>Vandals,</hi> who then made War against him, and carried along with him an Army both of <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi>; the former being commanded by Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> set upon the Enemies by surprize, and put them to flight; after which the King had the <hi>English</hi> in as much as esteem as his own <hi>Danish</hi> Subjects. But the year following,</p>

                  <q>He returned into <hi>England,</hi> and then held a <hi>Mycel Gemot,</hi>

The same year also King <hi>Cnute</hi> went to <hi>Assandune</hi> (the place where he had before fought the great Battel with King <hi>Edmund)</hi> and there caused a Church to be built of Lime and Stone for the souls of those men that had been slain there:</q> Which being (as <hi>R.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Also Archbishop <hi>Living</hi> deceased, and <hi>Ethelnoth</hi> a Monk and Dean of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was consecrated Bishop by <hi>Wulstan</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But before we proceed farther, I will give you some account of the Affairs of <hi>Wales</hi> in these times: Where after the death of <hi>Kynan,</hi> or <hi>Conan,</hi> the Usurping Prince of <hi>South-Wales</hi> above-mentioned, <hi>Lewelyn</hi> Prince of <hi>North-Wales</hi> had, according to <hi>Caradoc</hi>'s Chronicle, possessed

himself of <hi>South-Wales,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p>But this year produced a notable Impostor: for a certain <hi>Scot</hi> of mean Birth came now into <hi>South-Wales,</hi> and called him self <hi>Run,</hi> or <hi>Reyn,</hi> (as the Manuscript Copies have it) the Son of <hi>Meredyth ap Owen,</hi> late Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> as you have already heard: Upon which the Nobility of that Countrey, who loved not <hi>Lewelyn,</hi> set up this <hi>Run,</hi> or <hi>Reyn,</hi> to be their Prince; But <hi>Lewelyn</hi> hearing of it, assembled all the Forces of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> and marched against this <hi>Run,</hi> who had now also got all the strength of <hi>South-Wales</hi> together; and going as far as <hi>Abergwily</hi> (i. e. the mouth of the River <hi>Gwily)</hi> there waited the coming of <hi>Lewe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn</hi>; but when he arrived, and both Armies were ready to join Battel, <hi>Run,</hi> full of outward confidence, encouraged his men to fight; yet no sooner was the Battel begun, but this Impostor soon discovered what he was, by withdrawing himself p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ly out of the fight; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary, <hi>Lewelyn</hi> like a Couragious Prince standing in the Head of his Army, called out aloud for this base <hi>Scot, Run,</hi> who durst so belye the Blood of the <hi>British</hi> Princes: Both Armies then meeting, fought for a while with great Courage, and Malice to each other; but it seems the <hi>South-Wales</hi> men being not so resolute in the Quarrel of this Impostor, as those of <hi>North-Wales</hi> were to defend the Right of their Lawful Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the latter being also encouraged by the Speeches and Prowess of their Prince, put the former to the Rout, and pursued this <hi>Run</hi> so closely, that he had much ado to escape; Prince <hi>Lewelyn</hi> having got thus a great deal of Spoil, return'd home, and for a short time govern'd these Countries in Peace. But to return to our Annals;</p>

               <p>This year also, according to an Old Manuscript belonging to St. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundsbury,</hi> and cited by the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Coke,</hi> in the Preface to the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book of his <hi>Reports,</hi> King <hi>Cnute</hi> held a Parliament at <hi>Winchester,</hi> wherein were present the two Archbishops, and all the other Bishops, as also many Ealdormen and Earls, with divers Abbots, together with a great many Knights, and a vast multitude of People; and there, in pursuance of the King's desires, it was decreed, That the Monastery of St. <hi>Edmund the King</hi> should be free and for ever exempt from all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of the Bishops and Earls of that Country.</p>
               <p>But Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi> here very well observes, that this Manuscript could be no Ancienter than the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, because the word <hi>Parliament</hi> was not in use before that time.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But since our Annals do not tell us what he did there, I shall give it you in short from his own Letter, as I find it in <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> which upon his return from <hi>Rome,</hi> he wrote and sent into <hi>England,</hi> by <hi>Living</hi> Abbot of <hi>Tavistock</hi>; and begins thus:</p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Cnute,</hi> King of <hi>Denmark, Norway,</hi> and all <hi>Swedeland,</hi> to <hi>Ailnoth</hi> (or <hi>Egelnoth,</hi> the Metropolitan), and to <hi>Alfric</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> with all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Primates, and to the whole <hi>English</hi> Nation, as well <hi>Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> as <hi>Plebeians,</hi> Health: Wherein he gives an account of his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as also the reason of his undertaking it; then how honourably he was received at <hi>Rome,</hi> and what he had there negotiated for the benefit of his Subjects: Then he gives Directions and Commands to his Officers to do all Justice and Right to the People in his Absence, a thing to which he resolved on (as he says) long before, but never could till now accomplish what he had designed for the Pardon of his Sins and the Safety of all his Subjects; he further signifies, that he was received by all the Princes, who at that time were with Pope <hi>John</hi>; solemnizing the Feast of <hi>Easter,</hi> with extraordinary Respect and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but especially by <hi>Conrade</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Emperor; that he had dealt with them all about the concernments of his people both <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> that their Passage to <hi>Rome</hi> might be more free and open; and had obtained, that as well Merchants as others should with all safety pass and repass without any Toll or Imposition: He had also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the Pope, that his Archbishops paid vast Sums of Money before they could obtain their Palls, which Grievance was by the Pope's Decree taken off. All these Immunities procured from the Pope, the Emperor, <hi>Rodolph</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and all other Princes throughout whose Territories he travelled, were confirmed by Oath, under the Testimonies of Four Archbishops, and Twenty Bishops, with an innumerable Company of Dukes and other Noblemen there present. Then follows a Thanksgiving to Almighty God, for giving him such Success in what he had undertaken. After this, he desires it might be published to all the world, that having devoted his Life to God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s service, he resolved to govern the People subject to him in all Piety, Justice, and Equity; And in case any thing blameworthy had been done by him in his Youth, by the help of God he was now ready to make full amends for it. Therefore he charges all his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters whatsoever, as well Sheriffs as others, That for fear of him they should not pervert Justice, because there was no necessity that Money should be raised by any unjust exactions. And at last, after great Asseverations how much he studied the Profit and Conveniency of his People, he adjures all his Ministers before he arrived in <hi>England,</hi> that they should procure all Dues to be paid according to the ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom; as the Alms of the Plow, the <hi>Tythes</hi> of all Cattel brought forth in the same year, <hi>Peter-Pence</hi> in <hi>August,</hi> with the Tythes of Corn, and at <hi>Martinmass</hi> the First fruits of the same, called <hi>Curcescot,</hi> or

                     <hi>Cyrescot (i.e.</hi> Money given to the Church);<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MXXXI.</note> in case this was not paid before his Return, he threatens severely to animadvert upon every one according to the Laws.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> further adds, That at his Return he was as good as his word; for he commanded all the Laws which had been made by former <hi>English</hi> Kings, and chiefly by <hi>Ethelred</hi> his Predecessor, to be observed under great Penalties; for the true observation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, our Kings (says he) are at this very day sworn under the name of the Good Laws of King <hi>Edward</hi>; not that he only ordain'd them, but because he observed them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So that from hence we may take notice, That Kings who have the least of Hereditary Title, if they mean to reign happily, ought in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, as well as Conscience, to observe the Laws of that Kingdom to which they have been advanced without any Right of Blood.</p>
               <p>But to return again to our <hi>Annals</hi>; they further tell us, <q>That upon the King's return from <hi>Rome</hi> (where it seems he staid not long after) he marched into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and there King <hi>Malcolm</hi> became subject to him, with two other Kings (of the Isles) called <hi>Maelbaerth</hi> and <hi>Jehmarc.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The same year also <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Normandy</hi> went to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and there died; and <hi>William</hi> who was afterwards King of <hi>England,</hi> began to reign, being an Infant.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From whence we may plainly see, that the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Copy of these Annals was wrote in the form we have them, after the Conquest; and though the other Copies do not expresly call him King of <hi>England,</hi> yet they give him the Title of King <hi>William,</hi> which is all one.</p>
               <p>About this time (as the <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicles relate) the <hi>Irish Scots</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded <hi>South-Wales,</hi> by the means of <hi>Howel</hi> and <hi>Meredyth,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Edwin</hi> above-mentioned, who hired them against <hi>Rythaerch ap Jestyn,</hi> the Usurping Prince of that Countrey, whom by the assistance of these <hi>Scots</hi> they slew in Battel, and by that means got the Government of <hi>South-Wales,</hi> which they ruled jointly, but with small quiet; for the Sons of <hi>Rythaerch</hi> gathered together a great number of their Father's Friends, to revenge his death; with whom Prince <hi>Howel</hi> and <hi>Meredyth</hi> meeting at <hi>Hyarthwy,</hi> after a long Fight routed them, and made them fly; but the year following Prince <hi>Meredyth</hi> himself was slain by the Sons of <hi>Conan ap Sitsylt,</hi> Brother to Prince <hi>Lewelyn,</hi> to revenge their Father's death, whom <hi>Meredyth</hi> and his Brother <hi>Howel</hi> had slain.</p>

               <p>There is no King that can deserve a more various Character than this; since none who came in so roughly, after govern'd more mildly: He was naturally Cruel, and very Ambitious, and stuck not at any thing to gain a Kingdom, as appears by his dealing with his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor's Children, and Brothers; but more particularly with <hi>Olaf</hi> King of <hi>Norway,</hi> whom <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> relates to have been turn'd out of it by the secret Practices and Bribes which he liberally bestow'd upon the Great and Factious men of that Kingdom; but however, toward his latter end he reigned both prudently and moderately; and we may say of him what a <hi>Roman</hi> Author does of one of his Emperors, That it had been well for this Kingdom if he had never reign'd at all, or else had continued longer; none of his Sons resembling him either in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour or Wisdom.</p>

Huntington,</hi> who thus relates it, <hi>viz.</hi> That King <hi>Cnute</hi> being once at <hi>Southampton,</hi> caus'd his Royal Seat to be plac'd on the shore, while the Tide was coming in; and with a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestick Air said thus, <q>Thou <hi>Sea</hi> belongest to me, and the Land where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I sit is mine; nor hath any one unpunished resisted my Commands; I charge thee therefore come no further upon my Land, neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to wet the Feet of thy Sovereign Lord.</q> But the Sea, as before, came rowling on, and without any Reverence at all not only wet but dashed him; whereupon the King quickly rising up, bade those that were about him to consider the weak and bounded Power of Kings; and how none indeed deserved that Title, but He whose Eternal Laws both Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Earth, and Seas obey. A Truth so evident of it self,<note place="margin">M.</note> that were it not to shame his Court-Flatterers, (who would not else be convinced) <hi>Cnute</hi> needed not to have gone wet-shod home. From thenceforth he would never afterwards wear his Crown, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it to be put upon the Head of the Crucifix at <hi>Winchester.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From whose Example, as <hi>Petrus Pictaviensis</hi> relates, arose that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of hanging up the Armour of Great Men in Churches, as Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings made to God, by whose assistance they had attained any Honour to themselves, or Benefit to their Countrey, either by Victory, or an Honourable Death.</p>
               <p>I shall conclude his Reign with his Laws, which since we have not the time when they were made, I have reserved to this place: They begin thus:</p>
               <p>This is the Law (or Decree) which <hi>Cnute</hi> King of all <hi>England, Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> hath ordained with the Consent of his <hi>Wise Men</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> as well for the Maintenance of his own Royal Dignity, as for the Benefit of his People, and were made at <hi>Winchester</hi> in <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winter, (i.e.</hi> at <hi>Christmas)</hi> which, you must note, was one of the stated times when all the Great Men of the Kingdom, both Clergy and Laity, used of course to attend upon the King, whether he summoned them, or not.</p>
               <p>But since these Laws are very long, and contain a Repetition and Confirmation of divers Laws formerly made by his Predecessors, I shall only here extract some of them, and refer the Reader to Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi> for the rest.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>twelfth</hi> is remarkable, since it comprizes all those Forfeitures which the King challenges as due to himself, in the Counties of <hi>West-Saxony,</hi> except he please to confer them upon any other; <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Penalties incurr'd for the breach of the Peace, for breaking into a House, stopping up a Passage, and forsaking a man's Colours.

Some Great Men (says the King) if they can do it, will protect their Servants, giving out sometimes that they are Free, other times that they are Slaves; but we not enduring any such unjust practises, enjoin, That every one of twelve years of age shall give Security by Oath, that he will neither steal himself, nor be accessary to the Theft of any other.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus doth he revive what King <hi>Alfred</hi> had before ordained, That no Freeman should be out of <hi>Tything,</hi> or live at random, without this most efficacious Tye of Suretyship; and to what was enacted before, adds this caution of twelve years, beyond which, for the Publick Peace and Security, none were to live without being admitted and received into some Hundred and Tything.</p>

                  <q>The <hi>twentieth</hi> Law of King <hi>Cnute</hi> so far indulges a man unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and of good Repute, who never brake his Oath in the Hundred, nor was cast by the <hi>Ordeal,</hi> that his single Purgation shall be accepted.

But the <hi>Herriot</hi> of a <hi>Thane</hi> of the lowest condition, is two Pounds.</q>

               <p>This word <hi>Herriot,</hi> (or as the true <hi>Saxon</hi> word is written) <hi>Herë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geate,</hi> signifies Furniture for War, given by the Vassal to his Lord, probably at first designed for the driving away Thieves and Robbers, which abounded when the <hi>Danish</hi> or <hi>Northern</hi> Nations so frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the Land: For though the word <hi>Here</hi> does in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage

                  <q>The <hi>seventy first</hi> requires Widows to continue in Widowhood for the space of Twelve Months, and then permits them to marry: If a Woman marry before her Twelve Months be out, she shall lose her Dower, with all that her Husband left her, which is to come in such case to the next of kin; and he that marries her, shall pay the value of his Head to the King, or to whomsoever he assigns it.</q>

                  <q>The <hi>seventy fifth</hi> Law deprives him of Life and Estate, who either in an Expedition by Land or Sea deserts his Lord, or his Fellow-Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; and in such case the Lord is to have back the Land he gave him; or if it was <hi>Bocland,</hi> it goes to the King.

                  <q>The <hi>seventy seventh</hi> gives liberty to every man to hunt in his own Grounds, but forbids all men under a Penalty to meddle with the King's Game, especially in those places which he had fenced by Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By those places thus privileged, he means those which afterwards the <hi>Normans</hi> called <hi>Forests,</hi> being Ground Desart and Woody, lying open to the King's Deer, not fenced about with any Hedge or Wall, but cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed and privileged, or (as here he words it) fenced with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Bounds, Laws, and Immunities, under Magistrates, Judges, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Concerning these Forests, the King published certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions (Thirty four in number), which you may see at large in Sir <hi>Hen.

                  <q>That there was a great <hi>Witena Gemot,</hi> or Council of the <hi>Wise Men,</hi> held at <hi>Oxnaford,</hi> where Earl <hi>Leofric,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the <hi>Thanes</hi> on the <hi>East</hi> part of <hi>Thames,</hi> with the Seamen of <hi>London,</hi> chose <hi>Harold</hi> for King of all <hi>England,</hi> whilst his Brother <hi>Hardecnute</hi> was in <hi>Denmark:</hi> But Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> and all the Great Men of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> withstood it as much as they could, though they were not able to prevail against them.

It is said also by some concerning this King <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,</hi> that he was the Son of King <hi>Cnute,</hi> and of <hi>Aelgiva</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Aelfhelm</hi> the Ealdorman; but that seems scarce probable to many, however, he was full (or Real) King of all <hi>England.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>That which gave cause to this suspicion, was (as <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> and <hi>Radulph de Diceto</hi> relate) That this <hi>Aelgiva</hi> not being able to have Children by King <hi>Cnute,</hi> commanded the Son of a certain Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, then newly born, to be brought to her, and feigning a formal Lying in, to have imposed upon the credulous King her Husband, that she was really brought to bed of a Son; which, if true, shews that it is no new or strange thing for a Queen of <hi>England</hi> to impose a suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Birth upon the King her Husband, and the whole Nation.</p>
               <p>But this Contention about the Election of <hi>Harold,</hi> gives us great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to doubt the Truth of the Relation in <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> and other Authors, of this <hi>Harold</hi>'s being appointed by his Father's Will to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi>; such a Nomination or Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation seldom or never failing to be observed by the States of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom without any dispute, at the Election of a New King: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, Queen <hi>Aemma</hi> his Mother, who had then the greatest power with King <hi>Cnute,</hi> would sure much rather have had her own Son <hi>Hardecnute</hi> to have succeeded him in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> than <hi>Harold,</hi> at best supposed to be her Husband's Son by another Woman: So that if <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold</hi> was now chosen King, it is most likely that it was not in pursuance of King <hi>Cnute</hi>'s Will, but purely from the prevailing Faction of the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Londoners</hi>; who, as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> tells us, were by their long conversation with them, become wholly <hi>Danish</hi> in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations.</p>
               <p>But if <hi>Ingulph</hi> may be believed (who lived as well before as after the Conquest), there was then so great a Dispute about the Election of a King, that many fearing a Civil War would ensue, it caused multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of people to quit their Habitations, and betake themselves into Waterish and Fenny Places, where they thought the Enemy could not, or would no easily pursue them; and particularly to the Monastery of <hi>Croyland,</hi> where they caused such a disturbance, that the Monks of that

                  <hi>Manuscript</hi> Annals, now in the same Library (part of which is supposed to be written by <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington),</hi> That <hi>Harold</hi> was elected by the Chief Men of the <hi>East-Angles (i. e.</hi> the <hi>Danes</hi> of that Countrey) together with the <hi>Londoners</hi>; so that he usurped the Kingdom of his Brother <hi>Hardecnute,</hi> being then in <hi>Denmark.</hi> And <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> relates, That by the Consent of the Great Men of <hi>England, Harold</hi> began to reign as true and just Heir, but not so indisputably as King <hi>Cnute</hi> his Father had done; because <hi>Harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cnute,</hi> who was a truer Heir than he, was then expected; yet that in a short time the Kingdom became divided after the same manner as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulph</hi> hath related. But it seems very unlikely, that <hi>Hardecnute,</hi> if he had been chosen King of any part of <hi>England,</hi> would have left it, and gone over into <hi>Denmark,</hi> before he was well settled at home. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more likely (what <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> asserts), That <hi>Harold</hi> was at first elected King only of the <hi>Mercians</hi> and <hi>Northumbers, Hardecnute</hi> being to enjoy all the rest; but that not coming out of <hi>Denmark</hi> in due time, <hi>Harold</hi> got himself chosen King of the whole Kingdom the year following.</p>
               <p>But leaving this matter concerning <hi>Hardecnute</hi>'s Succession, which must be confessed is much in the dark, the Author last mentioned does say, That <hi>Harold</hi> after he had obtained the Royal Dignity, sent his Guards speedily to <hi>Winchester,</hi> and there tyrannically seized on the greater part of the Treasures of the King his Father, which had been bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Cnute</hi> to the Queen his Mother-in-Law.</p>
               <p>But I cannot omit taking notice of the most Cruel and Bloody Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Prince <hi>Alfred</hi> (Brother to King <hi>Edward</hi>) and his Followers; which because many of our Best and most Ancient Historians, as well Printed as Manuscript, refer to this year, and that too not long after King <hi>Harold</hi>'s coming to the Crown, I shall here set down, since it seems most likely to have happened now, rather than at any other time: For though our Authors differ much about it, yet seeing most of the Ancient <hi>Manuscript</hi> Annals in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library, (as also that old Treatise called <hi>Encomium Emmae,</hi> being a Panegyrick wrote on that Queen by a Monk of her own time) agree in relating the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of this horrid Action, I shall from thence transcribe this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Account of it; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That King <hi>Harold</hi> seeking by Treachery how to get those two young Princes, (Sons to the late King <hi>Ethelred)</hi> into his power, forged a Letter in the Name of Queen <hi>Emma</hi> their Mother, inviting them into <hi>England</hi>; wherein, personating her, she seemed to chide them gently

               </p>
               <p>This Letter was sent to the Princes, then in <hi>Normandy,</hi> by an express Messenger, with Presents also, as from their Mother; which they joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully receiving, returned word by the same hand, That one of them would be with her shortly, naming both the Time and Place. <note n="*" place="margin">Note, <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Alfred</hi> who was the younger (for so it was thought best) at the appointed time, with a few Ships, and some small number of <hi>Normans</hi> about him, appeared on the Coast, and no sooner came ashore, but fell into the Snare that Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> had laid for him, being sent on purpose to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him; and being cajoll'd into a belief that he was sent for by the King then at <hi>London,</hi> he was in the way met at <hi>Guilford</hi> by Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> who with all seeming Friendship at first kindly entertained him, but in the night surprized the Prince, and made him Prisoner, with all his Company, most of whom (in all about Six hundred men) were put to various kinds of cruel deaths, and being twice decimated, every Tenth man suffered without mercy. The Prince was brought to <hi>London</hi>; and by the King sent bound to <hi>Ely,</hi> and had his eyes put out as soon as he landed there; and being delivered to the Monks to be kept, died soon after in their Custody; but whether of the Pain, or Grief, or some other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition, is left uncertain.</p>
               <p>Yet though this Author makes no mention of Prince <hi>Edward</hi> his Brother's coming over with him; but rather asserting the contrary, that he never came at all; however, several other Historians will have this Prince to have either come over then, or some time before; and that being with his Mother when his Brother was thus treated, she im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately sent him back into <hi>Normandy</hi>; which I must confess seems very improbable, since <hi>Harold</hi> had it then in his power to destroy them both.</p>
               <p>But though it is certain that this unfortunate Prince was made away, yet since our <hi>Annals</hi> are wholly silent in it, there is nothing about which our Historians so much vary, as concerning the time when it was done. <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> and <hi>Bromton</hi> place it after the death of <hi>Harold</hi>; and before the coming over of <hi>Hardecnute</hi>; when they say that Prince <hi>Alfred</hi> arrived, with some expectations of the Kingdom; but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer plainly confesses, that he related this story only upon common fame; yet because the Chronicles <hi>(i. e.</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals) are silent, he will not affirm it for truth; so it seems he had never seen the above-mention'd <hi>Encomium Emmae.</hi> But that Prince <hi>Alfred</hi> was made away by the means of Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> we shall further make out when we come to the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the reason that some of our Historians give for <hi>Godwin</hi>'s cruel usage of Prince <hi>Alfred,</hi> whilst he let his Brother escape, is, that <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> was afraid of the High Spirit and Wit of this young Prince; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knew that if ever he came to be King, he would never be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by him, nor marry his Daughter; both which he hoped for from <hi>Edward,</hi> in case he should be chosen King by his means (as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93814:292"/>
happen'd). This, whether true or not, I will not determine; yet it suits well enough with the Interest of that Politick Earl. I shall say no more of this, only we cannot but hence observe the great Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Traditional Accounts, though of no long standing, since this Story, transacted not many years before the Conquest, is told so many several ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This year (according to our Annals) <hi>Aelgiva</hi> the Widow of King <hi>Cnute,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MXXXVII.</note> and Mother of King <hi>Hardecnute</hi> and King <hi>Edward,</hi> was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished; but going over to <hi>Baldwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> he assign'd her <hi>Bricge</hi> (i. e. <hi>Bruges)</hi> for her Retirement, where he protected her, and provided for her as long as she staid there.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But the Reader is to take notice, that this Queen, who is here called <hi>Aelgiva</hi> in the <hi>English-Saxon,</hi> is the same with <hi>Emma</hi> in the <hi>Norman-French</hi> Dialect, and who was now banished <hi>England</hi> by King <hi>Harold,</hi> as all Writers agree. But the reason why this Queen did not retire into <hi>Normandy,</hi> her own Countrey, was, that her Father and Brother were both dead; and though <hi>William</hi> her Nephew then succeeded in the Dukedom, yet he was but an Infant, under the Tutelage of the King of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This year also produced a great Revolution in <hi>Wales</hi>; for <hi>Griffyth ap Lewelyn ap Sitsylt,</hi> sometimes Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> raised a great Army against Prince <hi>Jago,</hi> who now enjoyed the Principality of <hi>North-Wales</hi> (as you have already heard); and <hi>Jago</hi> also provided for himself as well as he could; but the greater part, and the better Soldiers were of <hi>Griffyth</hi>'s side, for the love they bore to his Father, as plainly appeared when it came to a trial; for after the Battel was joined, <hi>Jago,</hi> his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers deserting him, was soon overthrown and slain; and then <hi>Griffyth</hi> reigned in his stead. From whence we may observe the strange fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Welsh</hi> Nation in those times, who notwithstanding their seeming Affection to this Prince the Right Heir, yet left him as soon as ever they met with one of the same Race whom they liked better. From which evil custom these Countries were never long without Civil Wars, till the total Conquest of them by the <hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Griffyth ap Lewelyn,</hi> after he had thus slain Prince <hi>Jago,</hi> govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>North-Wales</hi> very well, following his Father's steps; and in the very first year of his Government he fought with the <hi>Englishmen</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> at <hi>Crosford</hi> upon <hi>Severne</hi>; and from thence he led his Army to <hi>Lhanpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darn vawr</hi> in <hi>Caerdiganshire,</hi> and destroyed that place; and thence pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing into <hi>South-Wales,</hi> totally subdued it; <hi>Howel ap Edwin,</hi> at that time Prince thereof, being forced to fly his Countrey; and when he had thus reduced <hi>South-Wales,</hi> he returned home again with Honour. But the next year,</p>

                  <hi>Howel</hi> Prince of <hi>South-Wales</hi> (as the <hi>English</hi> as well as <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicles relate) having now procured <hi>Edwin</hi> the Brother of <hi>Leofric</hi> Earl of <hi>Mercia</hi> to assist him, marched with a great Army of <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> against Prince <hi>Griffyth,</hi> who meeting them in the field, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them, and slew <hi>Edwin</hi> at <hi>Pencadair,</hi> and pursued <hi>Howel</hi> so closely, that though he escaped himself, yet his Wife was taken Prisoner; whom <hi>Griffyth</hi> like so well, that he kept her for his Mistress.</p>
               <p>But though <hi>Howel</hi> after this made several Attempts to regain his Countrey, yet he could never succeed, for that Prince <hi>Griffyth</hi> held it all his time. But the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Chronicle relates, that fighting after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

with <hi>Griffyth</hi> at a place called <hi>Paldiwach,</hi> he obtained the Victory, and again made himself Prince of <hi>South-Wales:</hi> But this I leave to the Reader's Judgment. To return again to our Annals:</p>

Westminster</hi> place it; or else he could reign but Three Years, and perhaps so many odd Weeks as these <hi>Annals</hi> mention.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In his time was again paid a great Tax for the setting out Sixteen Sail; to wit, Eight Marks to every Rower (which shews it consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of only Gallies, and not Ships); and as <hi>Florence</hi> also adds, Twelve Marks more to every Master, which he order'd to be rais'd through all <hi>England</hi>; as was before done in the Reign of King <hi>Cnute.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But it seems every Port was bound to pay such a proportion, to set out these Sixteen Sail (as <hi>H. Huntington</hi> relates) whereby nevertheless he so much incensed the minds of the <hi>English</hi> against him, that the <hi>Welsh</hi> perceiving it, or else for some other reason, began to be very unruly; insomuch that some Insurrections happened thereupon, wherein many of the <hi>English</hi> Nobility were slain; as <hi>Edwin,</hi> Brother to Earl <hi>Leofric; Turketil</hi> and <hi>Algeat,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Effi,</hi> both of them Great Persons; and several others.</p>
               <p>And to this time (I suppose) we may refer what <hi>Caradoc</hi> in his <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicle relates, That <hi>Griffyth ap Lewelyn,</hi> Prince of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> in the first year of his Reign, fought with the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> at <hi>Cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> upon <hi>Severne,</hi> and put them to flight; and from thence he led his Army to <hi>Lhanpadan vawr</hi> in <hi>Caerdiganshire,</hi> and destroyed the place ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly; and from thence passed all over <hi>South-Wales,</hi> receiving the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into his subjection, for <hi>Howel ap Edwin</hi> their King fled before him, and forsook the Land.</p>
               <p>As for the Character of this King <hi>Harold,</hi> and the reason why he was called <hi>Harefoot,</hi> they are very uncertain: <hi>H. Knighton</hi> in his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle writes very oddly, That he had a Body like a Hare, sure he means hairy like that Creature, and from thence was called <hi>Harefoot</hi>; which is very improbable. But others with more appearance of truth, derive it from his Swiftness of Foot. <hi>Bromton</hi> gives him this Character, That in all respects he degenerated from the Worth of his Father King <hi>Cnute</hi> (insomuch that divers suspected him not to have been his Son), for he was altogether careless both as to matters of War and Peace; only he would pursue his own Will and Pleasure, and what was very unbecoming his Royal Estate, chusing rather to go on foot, than ride; whence, for the lightness and swiftness of his Feet, he seems to have been called <hi>Harefoot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for his Laws, we have only this one mentioned by Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> in his <hi>Janus Anglorum,</hi> which was, That whatever <hi>Welsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> coming into <hi>England</hi> without leave, was taken on this side <hi>Offa</hi>'s Ditch, should have his Right Hand cut off by the King's Officers.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But whether these Taxes were raised by Authority of the Great Council of the Kingdom, our Authors do not mention; but I believe not; for this <hi>Danegelt</hi> was now by constant usage become a Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</p>

                  </q> After which time Prince <hi>Edward</hi> returned no more thither, but staid in <hi>England</hi> till his Brother died.</p>
               <p>But the same year, not long after his Coronation, he sent <hi>Alfric</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> and Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> and divers Great Men of his Court to <hi>London,</hi> attended by the Hangman, and out of Hatred to his Brother <hi>Harold,</hi> and Revenge of the Injuries done to his Mother (as he pretended) commanded his Body to be dug up, and the Head to be cut off and flung into the <hi>Thames</hi>; but some Fishermen afterwards pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it up with their Nets, buried it again in St. <hi>Clement</hi>'s Church-yard, being then the Burying-place of the <hi>Danes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same year also (according to <hi>Bromton</hi>'s Chronicle) King <hi>Harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cnute</hi> sent over his Sister <hi>Gunhilda</hi> to the Emperor <hi>Henry,</hi> to whom she had been in her Father's life-time betroth'd: But before she went, the King kept the Nuptial Feast with that Magnificence in Cloaths, Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, and Feasting, that as <hi>Mat. Westminster</hi> relates, it was remembred in his time, and sung by Musicians at all great Entertainments. But this Lady was received and treated by the Emperor her Husband with great kindness for some time; till being accused of Adultery, she could find, it seems, no beter a Champion to vindicate her Honour, than a certain little Page she had brought out of <hi>England</hi> with her, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking her defence, fought in a single Combat against a man of a vast

               <p>About this time also (as <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham, Bromton</hi>'s Chronicle, and other Authors inform us) King <hi>Hardecnute</hi> was highly incensed against <hi>Living</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> for the death of his Half Brother <hi>Alfred,</hi> Son to King <hi>Ethelred; Alfric</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> accusing them both of having persuaded King <hi>Harold</hi> to use him so cruelly as you have already heard: The Bishop and Earl being thus accused before King <hi>Hardecnute,</hi> the former was deprived of his Bishoprick, and the latter was also in very great danger. But not long after, the King being appeased with Money, the Bishop was again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored; and as for Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> he had also incurred some heavy Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, had he not been so cunning as to buy his peace (as these Authors relate) by presenting the King with a Galley most magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently equipp'd, having a gilded Stern, and furnished with all Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences both for War and Pleasure, and mann'd with Eighty choice Soldiers, every one of whom had upon each Arm a Golden Bracelet weighing sixteen Ounces, with Helmet and Corslet all gilt, as were also the Hilts of their Swords; having a <hi>Danish</hi> Battel-Axe adorned with Silver and Gold, hung on his Left Shoulder, whilst in his Left Hand he held a Shield, the Boss and Nails of which were also gilded, and in his Right a Launce, in the <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Tongue called a <hi>Tegar:</hi> But all this would not serve his turn, without an Oath, That Prince <hi>Alfred</hi> had not his eyes put out by his Advice, but he therein merely obeyed <hi>Harold</hi>'s Commands, being at that time his King and Master.</p>
               <p>This year (according to <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham)</hi> King <hi>Hardecnute</hi> sent his <hi>Huisceorles (i. e.</hi> his Domestick Servants,<note place="margin">

Thereupon <hi>Hardecnute</hi> being exceedingly provoked to hear of their deaths, sent to revenge it, <hi>Leofric</hi> Ealdorman of the <hi>Mercians, Godwin</hi> of the <hi>West-Saxons, Siward</hi> of the <hi>Northumbrians,</hi> and others, with great Forces, and orders to kill all the men, plunder and burn the City, and waste the Countrey round about. On the evening preceding the thirteenth of <hi>November,</hi> they began to put his Commands in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and continued both wasting and spoiling the City and Countrey for four days together; but few of the Inhabitants themselves could be laid hold of, the Countrey-men shifting for themselves every man as well as they could, and the Citizens betaking themselves to a little Island in the <hi>Severne,</hi> called <hi>Beverege,</hi> which they fortified, and vigorously stood upon their Defence, till their Opposers being tired out and spent, were forced to make Peace with them, and so suffered them to return quietly home. This was not done till the fifth day, when the City being burnt, the Army retreated, loaded with the Plunder they had got.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simeon</hi> next after this cruel Expedition, places the coming over of Prince <hi>Edward</hi>; but our Annals with greater probability put his Return under the year before.</p>

Junii).</hi> He was King of <hi>England</hi> two years, wanting seven days, and was buried in the New Monastery (of <hi>Winchester)</hi>; his Mother giving the Head of St. <hi>Valentine</hi> to pray for his Soul.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But since our Annals are very short in the Relation of his Death, we must take it from other Authors; who all agree, That the King being invited to a Wedding at the place above-mentioned, which with great Pomp and Luxury was solemnized betwixt <hi>Tovy,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Prudan,</hi> a <hi>Danish</hi> Nobleman, and <hi>Githa</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Osgod Clappa,</hi> a great Lord also of that Nation; as he was very jolly and merry, carousing it with the Bridegroom and some of the Company, he fell down speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and died in the Flower of his Age.</p>
               <p>He is to be commended for his Piety, and Good Nature to his Mother, and Brother Prince <hi>Edward:</hi> But the great Faults laid to this Prince's charge, are Cruelty, Gluttony, and Drunkenness: For the first of these you have had a late Example; and for the latter, take what <hi>H. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington</hi> relates, That Four Meals a day he allowed his Court; and it must be then supposed he loved eating well himself; though this Author attributes it to his Bounty; and how he rather desired that the Meat should be taken away untouched from such as were invited, than that those who were not invited, should complain for want of Victuals; whereas, saith he, the custom of our time is (either out of Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or, as they pretend, because their people cannot eat) for Great Men to allow their Followers but one Meal a day; which shews, that the custom of Set Suppers hath had divers Vicissitude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, being not common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly used in <hi>England</hi> in Great Mens Families at the time when <hi>H. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington</hi> wrote, and therefore is an <hi>English</hi> Custom prevailing since that time; the <hi>Norman</hi> Fashions being then most used.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Rouse</hi> also, in his <hi>Manuscript</hi> Treatise <hi>de Regibus Ang.</hi> already cited, relates, That the day of King <hi>Hard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>cnute</hi>'s Death was in his time kept by the <hi>English</hi> as an Holiday, being called <hi>Hock-Wednesday</hi>; on which they danced, and drew Cords cross the way, as they do in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parishes in <hi>England</hi> even at this day, to stop people till they will pay them some Money.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> with greater probability says, That this King did not come to the Crown without some difficulty; for when he had received the News of his Brother <hi>Hardecnute</hi>'s Death, he was in great perplexity what was most advisable for him to do; at last, after mature deliberation, he thought it the safest course to trust his Fortune to Earl <hi>Godwin</hi>'s Advice; who being sent for to a friendly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, for some time he was considering whether he should come to him or not; but at length he agreed to speak with him; and upon the Enterview <hi>Edward</hi> was about to lay himself at his Feet, but that he would by no means suffer; Then the Prince earnestly desired he would assist him in his safe return to <hi>Normandy</hi>; when immediately <hi>Godwin</hi> gave him this unexpected answer, That he had better live gloriously King of <hi>England,</hi> than dye ignominiously in Exile: That the Crown did of Right belong to him as Son of <hi>Ethelred,</hi> and Grandchild of <hi>Edgar:</hi> That he was one of mature Age, inur'd to Labour, and who had learnt by experience how to order Publick Affairs with Justice; and had been taught by his own late Afflictions how to remove and prevent the Miseries of the People: That to bring this about, there would be no great Obstacle; for if he would but trust himself to him, he should find that his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest was very powerful in the Nation, and that Fortune would be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to his just Pretensions; and if he would accept of the Royal Dignity, he was confident there would be none to oppose it; but on condition that he would establish a firm Friendship with him and his Family, by promising to prefer his Sons, and marry his Daughter, that then he should soon find himself a King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi>'s case at this time was such, as not to reject so fair Proposals, but rather agree to any Conditions, and comply with the present state of Affairs; whatsoever therefore <hi>Godwin</hi> required, he promised and swore to perform. Now the Earl was a Man fitted by Nature for managing such an Intrigue, having a very smooth and plausible Tongue, so Eloquent, that he could move and charm the Affections of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, insinuate into them whatsoever he pleased, and bring them entirely over to his Interest and Service. Upon this he procures a Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to be summoned at <hi>Gillingham</hi> (some Copies have it, at <hi>London);</hi> and there he influenced some by his own Authority, gain'd over others by his Promises; and those who were inclined before to Prince <hi>Edward</hi>'s Cause, he fully settled and confirmed to his Party; the rest, that made opposition, being over-power'd, were first of all turn'd out of their Places, and then banished the Land.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Annals</hi> of the Abby of <hi>Winchester</hi> (printed in the <hi>Monast. Ang.</hi> from the Manuscript in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library) not only agree with <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> in this Relation, but are also much more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; <hi>viz.</hi> That Prince <hi>Edward</hi> coming to <hi>Godwin</hi> one morning in

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MXLI.</note> fell at his Feet, begging him to preserve his Life; but the Earl taking him up, promised to use him like his Son; and also gave him farther Encouragements and Assurance; so that <hi>Edward</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning again to <hi>Winchester</hi> to his Mother, <hi>Godwin</hi> shortly after sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned all the Great Men of the Kingdom to meet there, to consult about making a New King. Then these <hi>Annals</hi> proceed to relate the manner of this <hi>Election; Viz.</hi> That Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> raising the Prince from the place where he sate at his feet (being then <hi>incognito,</hi> having his Hood over his Face), said thus, <hi>Behold your King: This is Prince</hi> Edward, <hi>the Son of King</hi> Ethelred <hi>and Queen</hi> Emma: <hi>This is He whom I Elect,</hi> &amp;c.; and so first did him Homage: Then after some Debates among themselves, they all at last consented to his <hi>Election</hi>; so that if it displeased any there, they durst not shew their Discontent, since Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> would have it so; and <hi>Edward</hi> being thus Elected, was, not long after, crown'd at <hi>Westminster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which is also confirmed by an Ancient Chronicle <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Otho, D.</hi> 7.</note> in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library (already cited), ending with this Prince, which saith, That <hi>Hardecnute</hi> being dead, <hi>Eadward</hi> was advanced to the Crown by the endeavours chiefly of Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> and <hi>Living</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bromton</hi>'s Chronicle farther adds, That at this Grand Council all the Great Men of <hi>England</hi> agreed and swore with one consent, That no <hi>Danes</hi> should reign over them any more, because of the great Affronts and Contempts they had received from that Nation: For they held the <hi>English</hi> in such servile subjection, That if an <hi>Englishman</hi> had met a <hi>Dane</hi> upon a Bridge, he was obliged to stand still till the other had passed by; and if he had not bowed to the <hi>Dane,</hi> he was sure to be well basted for his neglect; so that as soon as King <hi>Hardecnute</hi> was dead, the <hi>English</hi> drove all the <hi>Danes</hi> out of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding the great happiness the <hi>English</hi> now received by having a King of their own Nation; yet it seems, <q>This year was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate for the Intemperance of the Season, which (as our <hi>Annals</hi> relate) destroyed the Fruits of the Earth; so that a great number of Cattel died. Also about this time <hi>Aelf</hi>—, Abbot of <hi>Burgh</hi> decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and <hi>Arnwi</hi> a Monk was chosen Abbot, being a mild and good man.</q>
               </p>
               <p>About the same time also, according to the <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicle, Prince <hi>Conan</hi> the Son of <hi>Jago,</hi> who had fled into <hi>Ireland</hi> to save his life, and coming now over from thence, being assisted with the Forces of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi> the <hi>Danish</hi> King of <hi>Dublin,</hi> entred <hi>North-Wales</hi> by surprize, took Prince <hi>Griffyth</hi> Prisoner, and was carrying him away to his Ships: But the people of the Countrey hearing of it, they immediately rose and pursued the <hi>Irishmen,</hi> and at last overtaking them, rescued their Prince, and made a great flaughter among them, the rest with much difficulty got to their Ships, and returned with <hi>Conan</hi> into <hi>Ireland.</hi>

                  <q>But notwithstanding K. <hi>Edward</hi> had been elected King ever since the last <hi>Summer,</hi> yet was he not Anointed or Crowned till this year, when (as our <hi>Annals</hi> relate) that Ceremony was performed on <hi>Easter</hi>-day with great Solemnity, by <hi>Eadsige</hi> the Archbishop, who also preached before the people, and instructed them for the King's good, as well as their own advantage.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is the first Discourse or Sermon that we can find was ever made of this nature at any King's Coronation.</p>

                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:93814:295" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <q>The same year also <hi>Stig and</hi> the Priest was consecrated Bishop of the <hi>East-Angles</hi>;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MXLII.</note> and presently after the King ordered all the Lands his Mother held from him to be surveyed, taking from her whatsoever Gold and Silver she had, with many other things, because she had been too severe to him, as well before he was King, as after; and as <hi>Roger Hoveden</hi> observes, had given him less than he expected from her.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So that in this Undutifulness to his Mother, he does not shew himself so great a Saint as the Monks represent him: But they say for his excuse, that he did it by the Advice of the Earls <hi>Leofric, Godwin,</hi> and <hi>Syward,</hi> by whom this Weak and Easy Prince was chiefly managed.</p>
               <p>This year also, according to the <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicles, <hi>Howel ap Edwin</hi> late Prince of <hi>South-Wales,</hi> with all the Forces he could raise of his own Countrey-men, and the <hi>English,</hi> entred <hi>South Wales,</hi> and began to spoil and havock it; of which when Prince <hi>Griffyth</hi> was informed, he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered his People together in <hi>North-Wales,</hi> and came courageously to meet his Enemies (whom he had twice before discomfited), and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came and chased them the third time, as far as the Spring of the River <hi>Towy</hi>; where after a long and dangerous Battel, <hi>Howel</hi> was slain, and his Army routed, and was so closely pursued, that few or none escaped alive: After whose Death <hi>Rytherch</hi> and <hi>Rees,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Rythaerch ap Jestyn,</hi> aspiring again to the Rule and Government of <hi>South-Wales,</hi> which their Father had once before acquired, gathered a great Army as well of strangers, as out of <hi>Guentland</hi> and <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> and meeting with <hi>Griffyth</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> he courageously animated his men with the remembrance of their former Victories under his Standard, and joined Battel with his Enemies, whom he found disposed to try if they could regain the Honour which before they had lost: Wherefore when they were come up to engage, the Fight was so bloody and desperate, that it continued till night parted both Armies, and then being quite spent, they retreated. But still each being fearful of one another, they thought it their best way to return to their own Countries to raise fresh Recruits.</p>
               <p>About this time was founded a Noble Monastery near <hi>Coventry</hi> in <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> by <hi>Leofric</hi> Earl of the <hi>Mercians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Cambden</hi>'s Britan. <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickshire.</hi>
                  </note> and the Lady <hi>Godiva</hi> his Wife, who was not only one of the most Beautiful, but most Pious Women of that Age; they also enriched this Monastery with great Presents both of Gold and Silver.</p>
               <p>By reason of which Monastery the Town adjoining became much more flourishing, and took the name of <hi>Coventry</hi> from this Convent: And we farther read in <hi>Bromton</hi>'s Chronicle, That this worthy Lady <hi>Godiva</hi> being desirous to exempt the said Town from the grievous Taxes and Tolls imposed on it, she earnestly and frequently sollicited her Husband to take them off, but yet was still denied: However, she ceasing not to renew her request, he told her jestingly at last, That if she would be content to ride naked through the Town, he would grant her Petition; which she readily undertook to do, and so commanding all people at that time to keep within doors, she covered her Body with her own Hair, of which she had so great a quantity, that it served in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a Mantle.</p>
               <p>Thus did she generously free the Citizens from those heavy Exactions which they then lay under, though by the no-very-decent exposing of her self; and afterwards gave them a Charter of Exemptions, affixing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93814:296"/>
her Husband's and her own Seal to it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MXLII.</note> Now how the Episcopal See came afterwards to be removed hither from <hi>Litchfield</hi> and <hi>Chester,</hi> we shall in its due place declare.</p>
               <p>The Charter of the Foundation of this Monastery, dedicated to our Blessed Lady, St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and all the Saints, is printed in <note n="*" place="margin">Vol. I.</note>

Neither did the Piety of these Liberal Persons rest here, for Earl <hi>Leofric,</hi> with the Assent of his Lady <hi>Godiva,</hi> repaired also the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of <hi>Leon</hi> (or <hi>Lemster</hi>) near <hi>Hereford</hi>; of <hi>Wenlock</hi>; of St. <hi>Were<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burga</hi> in <hi>Chester</hi>; of St. <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Worcester</hi>; and lastly, that of <hi>Evesham.</hi>

                  <q>This year Archbishop <hi>Eadsige</hi> resigned his Archbishoprick, by reason of great Bodily Infirmities; and by the King's leave, and the advice of Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> he consecrated <hi>Syward</hi> Abbot of <hi>Abbandune</hi> to succeed him; which thing was known but to few, till it was actually done, because the Archbishop was afraid lest some other, less Learned and Able, would either by Money or Interest obtain that See, if so be it was once divulged before it was done.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But of this <hi>Syward,</hi>

                     <hi>De Pontif. Lib.</hi> I.</note> 
                  <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> tells us, That though he was thus consecrated Archbishop, yet notwithstanding he was soon after deposed for his Ingratitude to his Predecessor, in that he defrauded the weak Old Man of his necessary maintenance: But however to make this <hi>Syward</hi> some amends, he was translated to the Bishoprick of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>; which was a great Fall indeed from the See of an Archbishop, to that of his principal Chaplain; but it seems he was resolved to be a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, though a mean one, comparatively.</p>
               <p>The Annals also relate, <q>That this year there was so great a Famine in <hi>England,</hi> that a <hi>Sester</hi> of <hi>Wheat</hi> (which, as <hi>Roger Hoveden</hi> tells us, was then a Horse-load) was sold for Sixty Pence and more.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Which was then a great deal of Money, considering the scarcity of Silver in those times, and that every Penny then weighed Four Pence of our Money.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Also the same year the King sail'd to <hi>Sandwic</hi> with Five and thirty Ships.]</q> And as <hi>R. Hoveden</hi> informs us, it was to meet <hi>Magnus</hi> King of <hi>Norway,</hi> then designing to invade <hi>England</hi>; but a War break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out with <hi>Sweyn</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> it put an end to that Expedition.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Also <hi>Aethelstan</hi> the <hi>Oeconomus,</hi> or Steward of the Abby of <hi>Abbing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> was made Abbot; and <hi>Stigand</hi> again received his Bishoprick of the East-Angles]; from which, it seems, by the cunning and Simonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal practices of Bishop <hi>Grymkytel,</hi> he had been before deprived.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The same year King <hi>Edward</hi> married the Daughter of Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> whose Name was <hi>Edgitha,</hi> or <hi>Editha.</hi>]</q> A Woman (as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> says) not only of great Beauty and Piety, but also Learned above what Women usually were in that Age wherein he lived; insomuch that <hi>Ingulph</hi> tells us, when he was but a Boy, and lived at Court with his Father, she was wont to meet him as he came from School, and took delight to pose him in Verses; and would also, passing from <hi>Grammar,</hi> argue with him in <hi>Logick,</hi> in which she was well skill'd; and when she had done, would order her Waiting-Woman to give him some Money.</p>

                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:93814:296" rendition="simple:additions"/>But as King <hi>Edward</hi> had till now deferr'd the performance of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise in marrying this Lady ever since he came to the Crown,<note place="margin">

               <p>But notwithstanding the temptation of so fair a Lady, he not only kept his own Virginity inviolable, but also persuaded her to do the like; and this,<note place="margin">

                  </note> (as the Abbot of <hi>Rieval</hi> in his Life relates) he did not do out of any hatred to her Father, (as is commonly reported by several of our other Historians) but because the <hi>English</hi> Nobility, being desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous that one from his Loins should succeed him, had importun'd him to marry, which he could not well refuse (for then the secret Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of his dying a Virgin, would have been disclosed); there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he wedded her, both to secure himself against her Father, as also to make the Virtue of his Continence appear more conspicuous; which, as this Author tells us, was no Secret, being then divulged, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved all over <hi>England</hi>; and divers Censures passed concerning the motives why he did so.</p>

                  <q>Also this year (according to our <hi>Annals,</hi> as well as other Authors) was the great Battel of <hi>Vallesdune</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> between <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Nobility of that <hi>Dukedom,</hi> because they refused to receive <hi>William</hi> the Bastard for their Duke: But when he afterwards got them into his power, he beheaded some of them, and others he banished.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have mentioned this, to let you see with how great difficulty this young Duke (who was afterwards King of <hi>England)</hi> was settled in that Dutchy, which he could never have obtained without the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Assistance of the King of <hi>France.</hi>

                  <q>The same year, or else in 1048 (as it is in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Copy of the <hi>Annals)</hi> was held the great Synod or Council at St. <hi>Remy,</hi> where were present Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and the Archbishop of <hi>Burgundy (i. e.</hi> of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanson,</hi> tho they are here mentioned as two several Archbishopricks) as also the Archbishop of <hi>Treves,</hi> and <hi>Remes,</hi> with many other Wise Men both of the Clergy and Laity; and thither King <hi>Edward</hi> sent Bishop <hi>Dudoce,</hi> and <hi>Wulfric</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s, with Abbot <hi>Aelfwin,</hi> that they might acquaint the King what was there decreed concerning the Christian Faith.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>In the mean time a Report was brought to the King, That a Fleet of Enemies were landed on the Coast of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> and there taking of Prey: Then Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> sail'd about toward the <hi>East</hi> with two of the King's Ships, one of which his Son <hi>Harold</hi> commanded, and the other Earl <hi>Totsige</hi> his Brother, and also Two and forty Sail of the people of the Countrey: Then was Earl <hi>Harold</hi> with the King's Ships driven by a Storm into <hi>Pevensee,</hi> and there detain'd by contrary Winds; but within two days after, Earl <hi>Sweyn</hi> came thither, and had Conference with his Father, Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> and Earl <hi>Beorne,</hi> whom he intreated to accompany him to the King at <hi>Sandwic,</hi> and there use their interest to make his Reconciliation with him; but whilst they were on their way, <hi>Sweyne</hi> begged of <hi>Beorne</hi> (his Cousin) that he would go back along with him to his Ships, saying, He feared lest his men would desert him, unless he speedily returned; whereupon complying with him, they went back to the place where the Ships rode, and there <hi>Sweyn</hi> was very importunate with him to go on Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board; but he utterly refusing that, the Mariners bound him, and then put him into a Pinnace, and so carried him on board by force; then hoisting up Sail, they steered <hi>Eastward</hi> to <hi>Axamutha,</hi> and there kept him till they had made him away.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Then they took his Body, and buried it in a certain Church; but afterwards his Relations and the Mariners of <hi>London</hi> came, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging up his Body, carried it with them to the old Church of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> where they buried it near his Uncle King <hi>Cnute:</hi> Then <hi>Sweyn</hi> sailing <hi>Eastward</hi> towards <hi>Flanders,</hi> staid there a whole Winter in <hi>Brycge,</hi> with Earl <hi>Baldwin</hi>'s good leave.

                  <q>About the same time the Archbishop, returning from <hi>Rome</hi> the day before the Vigil of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> was Installed in the Episcopal Throne at <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> on St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Day: Then came to him <hi>Sparhafoc</hi> with the King's Letters and Seal, commanding that he should conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate him Bishop of <hi>London</hi>; but the Archbishop refusing it, said, The Pope had forbad him to do it: After which, the Abbot return'd to the Archbishop, and desired his Episcopal Orders, but he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily denied them, saying, The Pope had strictly charged him not to do it. Then the Abbot went to <hi>London,</hi> and held the Bishoprick nothwithstanding all that Summer, and the Autumn following.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Then <hi>Eustatius</hi> (Earl of <hi>Boloigne,</hi> the King's Brother-in-Law) came from beyond the Seas, and having been with the King, and told him his Business, he return'd homewards; and when he came to <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> he refreshed himself and his Company, and so went on to <hi>Dofra</hi> (i. e. <hi>Dover),</hi> but when he was within a Mile of this side thereof, he and his Retinue put on their Breast-plates, and so entred the Town: As soon as they were come thither, they took up their Quarters in what Houses they liked best; but one of his Followers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to quarter in the House of an Inhabitant there whether he would or no, because he told him he should not, he wounded him; whereupon the Master killed him: At which News Earl <hi>Eusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> being very much incensed, mounted to Horse, with all his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, and setting upon the Good Man of the House, killed him even within his own doors; and then going into the Town, they killed partly within, and partly without, more than Twenty men. But the Townsmen (to be even with them) killed Nineteen of their men, and wounded many more.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Upon this Earl <hi>Eustatius</hi> making his Escape with a few Followers, went to the King, and told him what had happen'd, so much as made to his purpose; at which the King being highly provoked with the Townsmen, sent Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> and commanded him to march to <hi>Dofra</hi> in a Hostile manner; for <hi>Eustatius</hi> had only insinuated to the King, as if what had happen'd had been wholly through the Townsmens fault, though indeed it was quite otherwise: But the Earl was very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to go into <hi>Kent,</hi> because he looked on it as an odious thing for him to destroy his own people.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> farther relates, he plainly saw the King was imposed on, and had passed sentence upon them, when he had only heard one side: And indeed the Earl was much concerned to see Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers find greater favour with the King, than his own Subjects; for <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statius</hi> had got a Friend near the King, who had very much exasperated him against them; therefore though the King continually press'd Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> to go into <hi>Kent</hi> with an Army, to be revenged of the men of <hi>Dofra,</hi> yet he still declined it, which much displeased the King; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless the Earl's Proposal seem'd but just and reasonable, That the Officers of the Castle (who it seems had a hand in this business) should be first summoned to answer in the King's <hi>Curia</hi> or Court, concerning this Sedition; and that if they could clear themselves there, they might be discharged; but if not, that they might make satisfaction to the King and the Earl with their Bodies and Estates; for Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> told the King, that it would seem very unjust to condemn those unheard, whom he ought chiefly to protect and defend.</p>

                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:93814:298" rendition="simple:additions"/>And so far no doubt the Earl was in the right,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MXLVIII.</note> and behaved himself like a true <hi>Englishman,</hi> in thus declining to execute the King's unjust Commands; though not in what he did afterwards. But to return again to our <hi>Annals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The King hereupon summoned all his Chief and <hi>Wise Men</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at <hi>Gloucester,</hi> a little after the Feast of St. <hi>Mary</hi>; for the <hi>Welsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> had in the mean time built a Castle in <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> upon the Lands of Earl <hi>Sweyn,</hi> and had done a great deal of mischief to the King's Liege-People in the Neighbourhood: Then Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> (with <hi>Sweyn</hi> and <hi>Harold,</hi> his Sons) met at <hi>Byferstane</hi> (i. e. <hi>Beverston</hi> in <hi>Gloucestershire</hi>) together with a great many in their Retinue, to attend on the King their Natural Lord, and all the Chief and <hi>Wise Men</hi> that waited on him, whereby they might have the King's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and Assistance, as also that of his Great Council, to revenge the Affront and Dishonour which had been lately done to the King and the whole Nation: But the <hi>Welshmen</hi> getting first to the King, highly accused the Earls, insomuch that they durst not appear in his presence, for they said they only came thither to betray him: But then there came to the King the Earls <hi>Syward</hi> and <hi>Leofric,</hi> with many others from the <hi>North</hi> parts, being (as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> relates) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> who had been summoned by the King to come thither: But whilst (according to our <hi>Annals)</hi> it was told Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> and his Sons, that the King and those that were with him were taking Counsel against them, they on the other side stood resolutely on their own defence; though it seem'd an hard thing for them to act any thing against their Natural Lord.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> adds farther, That Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> commanded those of his Party not to fight against the King; yet if they were set upon, that they should defend themselves; so that there had then like to have happen'd a Cruel Civil War, if calmer Counsels had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed.</p>
               <p>By this you may see the great Power of Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> and his Sons, who could thus withstand the King, and all the Nobility that were with him. But to proceed with our <hi>Annals:</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>Then it was agreed by the chief men on both sides, that they should desist from any further violence; and thereupon the King gave them <hi>God</hi>'s Peace, and his own Word.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After this, the King and his Great Men about him resolved a second time to summon a <hi>Witena Gemot,</hi> or Great Council at <hi>London,</hi> at the beginning of <hi>September:</hi> He also commanded an Army to be raised, as great as ever had been seen in <hi>England,</hi> both from the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> side of <hi>Thames.</hi> When this Council met, Earl <hi>Sweyn</hi> was declared outlaw'd, and Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> and Earl <hi>Harold</hi> were cited to appear at the Council with all speed. As soon as they were come there, they desired <hi>Peace</hi> (i. e. <hi>Security)</hi> and also Pledges to be given them, whereby they might have safe ingress and regress to and from the Council: But the King required all the Earl's Servants to deliver them up into his hands; after which the King sent to them, commanding them to come with Twelve men to the Great Council; but the Earl again demanded Securities and Pledges to be given him, and then he promised to clear himself from all Crimes laid to his charge: But the Pledges were still denied him, and there was only granted him a five

               </p>
               <p>But note, that <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> places this Quarrel with Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> and his Sons, three years later, <hi>viz.</hi> under <hi>Anno</hi> 1051; and farther adds, That the reason why Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> fled thus privately away, was, that his Army had forsook him, so that he durst not plead the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the King, but fled away the night following with his five Sons, carrying away all their Treasure with them into <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Relation which <hi>Florence</hi> and the Printed Copy of these <hi>Annals</hi> give us of this great difference between the King and Earl <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> and his two Sons; in the carriage of which both Parties are to be blamed; the King in yielding so easy an ear to the false Accusations brought against them, and they in refusing to stand to the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Great Council of the Kingdom, without Pledges first given them by the King, which is more than any Subject ought to require from his Prince: But certainly the King shewed himself a very Weak Man, in being persuaded to deal thus severely with his Innocent Queen, for the Faults of her Father and Brothers, which it was not in her power to help.</p>

               </p>
               <p>She hath a various Character given her by our Historians; <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> represents her to be very Covetous, and Unkind to her first Husbands Children; which seems to have been true enough: But then she was very Devout, and had a great Respect for the Bishops and Monks, from whom she was sure to have their good word; yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever she did not escape Scandal, for she had several Enemies that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed the King against her, but especially Archbishop <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who had accused her some years before her death, of being too familiar with <hi>Alwin</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester:</hi> Whereupon she was sent to the Abby of <hi>Werewell,</hi> having first of all her Goods taken from her, whilst the Bishop was committed to Prison, Archbishop <hi>Robert</hi> crying out, That such Villany ought not to go unpunished, for fear it should be an encouragement for others to do the like; but she not being kept very strictly, wrote to all the Bishops of <hi>England</hi> whom she knew to be her Friends, professing that she was more troubled at the Disgrace offered to the Bishop, than that which was done to her self; and that she was ready to clear his Innocency by the Fire <hi>Ordeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this the Bishops met, and had easily prevailed with the King to put up the business, had not Archbishop <hi>Robert</hi> stifly opposed them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of his Brethren, <q>How they could have the confidence to take upon them the Defence of that Beast rather than Woman, (meaning the Queen Mother) who had so detracted from the King her Son, and yet had called her Paramour, <hi>The Anointed of the Lord?</hi> But (said he) this Woman will purge the Bishop, but who shall purge her that consented to the Death of her Son <hi>Alfred,</hi> and prepared Poyson for his Brother (now King) <hi>Edward?</hi> But if she desires to be acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, let her accept of her own Proposal, and walk barefoot over Nine Red-hot Plowshares, four for her self, and five for the Bishop, and then if she escape untouch'd, let her pass for Innocent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this the Day for Trial was appointed, and she having the night before at his Shrine earnestly invoked the Assistance of St. <hi>Swithin,</hi> she came to the place, where the King and all the Bishops (except <hi>Robert)</hi> were present; and there passed unhurt over all the Red-hot Plowshares, to the great Joy and Wonder both of her self and all the Spectators, especially of the King her Son, that she had so well cleared her self; then he was very sorry that he had been so credulous as to admit those Calumnies against his own Mother, whose Pardon he now begged, as also the Bishops; and (as divers of the Monkish Writers relate) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Penance from them on his bare back.</p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Emma</hi> for this signal Deliverance gave to St. <hi>Swithin</hi> Nine Mannors, and the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> as many, the Innocency of them both being hereby absolutely cleared.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The same year it was also decreed by the King and his Chief Men, That Ships should be sent to <hi>Sandwich,</hi> and that Earl <hi>Rolfe</hi> and Earl <hi>Odda</hi> should command them; in the mean time Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> departed from <hi>Brycge</hi> with his Ships to <hi>Ysera</hi> (a place we know not), and then landing the next day but one to <hi>Midsummer-Eve,</hi> he came to the Head or Point lying on the <hi>South</hi> side of <hi>Rumenea</hi> (now <hi>Rumney</hi> in <hi>Kent)</hi> which when it was told the Earls at <hi>Sandwic,</hi> they immediately sail'd out in pursuit of him, and also commanded the Land-Forces to be in a readiness to join them: But is seems Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> had timely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, and so he fell back to <hi>Pevensea</hi> (i. e. <hi>Pensey</hi> in <hi>Sussex</hi>); and then so violent a Tempest arose, that the Earls could not inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves which way <hi>Godwin</hi> was gone; but afterwards he returned and came to <hi>Brycge,</hi> and the King's Ships went to <hi>Sandwic,</hi> and from thence they were order'd back to <hi>London,</hi> and other Captains to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them; but the matter was so long delay'd, that all the Seamen left their Ships, and returned to their own homes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>As soon as Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> heard this, he set out his Fleet again to Sea, and sail'd directly <hi>Westward</hi> to the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> where his men going ashore, plundered so long till at last the people would give them what Contributions soever they demanded. Then they sail'd further <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> till they came to the Isle of <hi>Portland,</hi> and there going again on shore they did all the damage they could to the Inhabitants. In the mean time <hi>Harold</hi> return'd from <hi>Ireland</hi> with Nine Ships, and landed at <hi>Portloc</hi> Bay (in <hi>Somersetshire)</hi> where much people were got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against him; but he not being at all afraid of them, marched out to seek Provisions, and there killed all before him, taking Men, Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and Money, whatsoever he met with. From thence he sail'd <hi>Eastward</hi> towards his Father, whom having met, they went together to the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and there plunder'd whatsoever was left; and thence coasted to <hi>Pevensea,</hi> where they took all the Ships that were in that Harbour; afterwards they went to the <hi>Naesse Point,</hi> and carried away all the Ships that were in <hi>Rumenea, Hythe,</hi> and <hi>Folcestane,</hi> (now <hi>Folcston</hi> in <hi>Kent).</hi> Thence they sail'd <hi>Eastward</hi> again to <hi>Dofra,</hi> and going on shore, took there as many Ships and Hostages as they could; and then went to <hi>Sandwic,</hi> where also they did the like; so that they had Hostages and Provisions given them where ever they came, as much as they required; then again they sail'd to <hi>Northmuthe</hi> (suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be that which we call now the <hi>Buoy in the Nore)</hi> and thence up towards <hi>London</hi>; they also sent some Ships to <hi>Scepige,</hi> and there did a great deal of mischief; then they turn'd to <hi>Middle-tune,</hi> a Town of the King's (in <hi>Essex)</hi> and burnt it down to the ground; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Earls went towards <hi>London,</hi> but when they came thither, they found the King with all his Great Men ready to receive them with Fifty

Sail. Then the outlaw'd Earls sent to the King, beseeching him,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Then were assembled by God's assistance Bishop <hi>Stigand</hi> and other Prudent Men, as well within the City as without, and there they agreed upon a Peace to be made, Hostages being first given on both sides; which when Archbishop <hi>Rodbert</hi> and the other <hi>Frenchmen</hi> understood, they took Horse, and fled some <hi>Westward</hi> to <hi>Pentecost</hi>'s Castle, (but where it was we do not now know) and others <hi>Northward</hi> to a Castle of Archbishop <hi>Rodbert</hi>'s, who together with Bishop <hi>Vlf</hi> and all their Party, going out at the <hi>East</hi> Gate (I suppose of <hi>London</hi>) kill'd and wounded many young men (who I suppose went about to seize them); thence they went directly to <hi>Ealdulphe</hi>'s-<hi>Naese</hi> (now the <hi>Nesse-Point</hi> in <hi>Essex)</hi> where the Archbishop going on board a small Vessel, left his Pall and Bishoprick behind him (as God would have it) since he had attain'd that Honour without God's Approbation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From all which Transactions we may draw these Observations, That all this Contest between the King and Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> seems to have been chiefly from the two great Factions, that of the <hi>Normans</hi> whom the King brought over with him, and that of his <hi>English</hi> Subjects; and which happening under a Weak and Easy King, that had neither the Prudence nor Courage to keep the Balance even, it produced this Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratical War, made by Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> and his Sons, to force the King to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store them to their Estates. All which not only shews the great Power of this Earl and his Partizans, but also that those who have the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand at Sea, may force a King of <hi>England</hi> to what Terms they please. It is also evident, that these <hi>Annals</hi> were wrote by some Monk of the <hi>English</hi> Party, who was wholly of Earl <hi>Godwin</hi>'s side. But to return again to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Then was appointed a Great Council without <hi>London,</hi> where all the Earls and Chief Men then in <hi>England</hi> were present; and there Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> pleaded for himself, and was acquitted before the King and the whole Nation; and affirmed that he and <hi>Harold</hi> his Son, with the rest of his Children, were innocent of the Crimes whereof they stood accused: Whereupon the King received the Earl and his Sons, with all those of his Party, into his full Grace and Favour, restoring him to his Earldom, and whatsoever else he before enjoyed, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to every one his own again. And then too the King restored to the Queen his Wife (who had been before sent away) whatsoever she had been possessed of; but Archbishop <hi>Rodbert</hi> and all the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> were outlaw'd and banish'd, because they were those who had been the chief Incendiaries of this Quarrel between the King and the Earl; and Bishop <hi>Stigand</hi> was then made Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>

               <p>Though our <hi>Annals</hi> are in the Relation of what passed at this Great Council much more particular than most of our Historians, yet in the Account of this War between the King and Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> there are some things to be further taken notice of; as what <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, That Earl <hi>Harold</hi> when he came out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> first entred the Mouth of <hi>Severne,</hi> and there spoiled the Coast of <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering

                     </gap>ot (i. e.</hi> the <hi>Land's-End)</hi> and met his Father, as you have heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and when it was told King <hi>Edward</hi> that Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> was come to <hi>Sandwic,</hi> he commanded all those who had not revolted from him, to make haste to his Assistance; but they delay'd so long their coming up, that in the mean while <hi>Godwin</hi> with his Fleet sail'd up the River <hi>Thames</hi> as far as <hi>Southweork,</hi> and there lay till the Tide, but yet not without sending Messengers to some of the chief Citizens of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> whom he had before drawn over to his Party by fair Promises, and so far prevailed with them, that they absolutely engaged themselves to be at his service, and do whatever he would command them: Then all things being thus prepared, the next Tide they weighed Anchor, and sail'd <hi>Southward</hi> up the Stream, no body opposing them on the Bridge. From whence we may observe, that those Ships he had, were only small Galleys, with Masts to be taken up and down at pleasure, much like our Huoys at this day.</p>
               <p>Then came the Earl's Land-Army, and flanking themselves all along the side of the River, made a very thick and terrible Body, insomuch that he turned his Fleet toward the <hi>Northern</hi> Shore, as if he were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to have encompassed that of the King's (which it seems then lay above-Bridge, over-against <hi>London):</hi> And though He had at that time both a Fleet, and a Numerous Land-Army of Foot-Soldiers, yet they being all <hi>English,</hi> abhorred to fight against their own Kinsfolks and Countreymen; and therefore the wiser sort of both sides laid hold on this Opportunity, and became such powerful Mediators between the King and the Earl, as made them mutually to strike up a Peace, and so dismiss their Armies.</p>
               <p>The next day the King held a Great Council, and restored Earl <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> and his Sons to their former Honours and Estates, except <hi>Sweyn</hi>; who, being prick'd in Conscience for the Murther of his Cousin <hi>Beorn,</hi> was gone from <hi>Flanders</hi> barefoot as far as <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and in his return homeward died in <hi>Lycia</hi> of a Disease contracted through extreme Cold.</p>
               <p>A firm Concord and Peace being thus concluded, both the King and the Earl promised right Law <hi>(i. e.</hi> Justice) to all people, and banished all those <hi>Normans</hi> that had introduced unjust Laws, and given false Judgments, and committed many Outrages upon the <hi>English</hi>; though some of them were permitted to stay, as <hi>Robert</hi> the Deacon, and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Fitzscrob,</hi> his Son-in-Law, as also <hi>Alred</hi> the Yeoman of the King's Stirrup, <hi>Anfred</hi> sirnamed <hi>Cocksfoot,</hi> and some others who had been the King's greatest Favourites, and always faithful to him and the People; all the rest were sent away, and amongst them was also <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> Bishop of <hi>London</hi>; but he being a good honest man, was called back again in a short time: <hi>Osbern,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Pentecost,</hi> (from whom the Castle above-mention'd was so called) and his Companion <hi>Hugh,</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd their Castles; and by the License of Earl <hi>Leofric,</hi> passing through his Earldom of <hi>Mercia,</hi> went into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and were there kindly received by King <hi>Macbeth.</hi>

                  <hi>viz.</hi> That the King having summoned a Great Council, as soon as he there beheld Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> immediately accused him before them all, of having betrayed and murthered his Brother Prince <hi>Alfred,</hi> in these words; <q>Thou Traytor <hi>Godwin,</hi> I accuse thee of the Death of <hi>Alfred</hi> my Brother, whom thou hast traitorously murthered; and for the Proof of this, I refer my self to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Curiae Vestrae, (i. e.</hi> your Court.)</q> Then the King proceeded thus, 'You, most Noble <hi>Lords,</hi> the <hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Barons</hi> of the Kingdom (where note, That by <hi>Barons</hi> are to be understood <hi>Thanes,</hi> for they were one and the same before the Conquest) <q>You who are my Liege-men, being here assembled, have heard my Appeal, as also the Answer of Earl <hi>Godwin;</hi> I will that you now give a Right Sentence between us in this my Appeal, and afford due Justice therein.</q> Then the <hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Barons</hi> having maturely debated this matter among themselves, some were for giving Judgment for the King; but others differed from them, saying, That Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> had never been obliged to the King by either Homage, Service, or Fealty, and therefore could be no Traytor to him; and besides, that he had not kill'd the Prince with his own hands. But others replied, That no <hi>Earl, Baron,</hi> nor any other Subject of the King, could by Law wage Battel against him in his Appeal, but ought upon the whole matter to submit himself to the King's Mercy, and offer him reasonable Amends. Then <hi>Leofric</hi> Earl of <hi>Chester,</hi> who was an upright and sincere man both with respect to God and the world, spoke thus: Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> who next to the King is indeed a Person of the best Quality in <hi>England,</hi> cannot deny but that by his Counsel <hi>Alfred</hi> the King's Brother was killed; and therefore my opinion is, That both he himself and his Sons, and Twelve of us Earls that are his Friends and Kinsmen, should appear humbly before the King, each of us carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much Gold and Silver as he can bold in his Arms, and offering it to him, most humbly supplicate for his Pardon; and then the King should remit to the Earl all Rancor and Anger whatsoever against him, and having received his Homage and Fealty, peacebly restore him to all his Lands. To this the Assembly agreed; and those that were appointed, loading themselves with Treasure after the manner aforesaid, went unto the King, shewing him the order and manner of their Judgment, which he being unwilling to contradict, complied with, and so ratified whatever they had before decreed.</p>
               <p>This, tho written a long time after the Conquest, as appears by the Words there used, <hi>viz. Parliament, Baron, Homage</hi> and <hi>Fealty</hi>; yet it might be true in the main, as being transcribed out of some Ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Great Councils of those times, which are now lost; and if so, would be a Notable Precedent of the large Authority of the <hi>Witena Gemot,</hi> or Great Council of the Nation, not only in assenting to new Laws, but also of their Judicial Authority in giving Judgment upon all Suits or Complaints brought before them, as well in Appeals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Subject and Subject, as also where the King himself was a Party; and if Authentick, would also shew, not only that this Tenure of the King by Homage and Fealty was in use before the Conquest, but also (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Judgment of this Great Council) that there was no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance due by Birth, nor until a man had actually performed his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, or sworn Fealty to the King; and lastly, that a satisfaction made by Money, was looked upon as sufficient for the Death even of the

                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLII.</note> Yet to deal ingenuously with the Reader, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this fair story, <hi>Bromton</hi> himself seems to doubt the truth of it; for after he hath there told us from some nameless Author, that Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> (out of fear of some of the <hi>English</hi> Nobility, who had sworn to be revenged of him for the murther of Prince <hi>Alfred</hi>) retired into <hi>Denmark,</hi> during the Reign of King <hi>Hardecnute</hi>; but returning in the beginning of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at a Parliament at <hi>London,</hi> where the King impeached him of the Death of his Brother in the manner as you have already heard; and if so, this could not fall out as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> supposes in this Great Council, after this last return of Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> which happen'd not in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but the middle of this King's Reign. With which Relation also agree two Ancient Chronicles in <hi>French,</hi> written in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and are both in the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Bromton</hi> himself acknowledges, that according to most Authors Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> never went into <hi>Denmark</hi> at all, nor left <hi>England</hi> during the Reign of King <hi>Hardecnute</hi>; so that this Transaction (if it ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd at all) seems most likely to have fell out in the Reign of King <hi>Hardecnute,</hi> when that King charged Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> with his Brother's Death, and made him redeem it with a great Present, as we have above told you.</p>

                     <hi>Kal.</hi> of <hi>May)</hi> and was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Old Monastery of <hi>Winchester.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Of the manner of whose Death, though our <hi>Annals</hi> are silent, yet I shall here set down what I find concerning it by almost all our Historians, and it is thus; That King <hi>Edward</hi> celebrating the Feast of <hi>Easter</hi> at <hi>Winchester</hi> (or at <hi>Windsor,</hi> as some will have it) Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> as his Custom was, sitting at Table with him, was suddenly seized with so violent a Distemper, that it struck him speechless, and made him fall off from the Chair on which he sate; and his Three Sons <hi>Harold, Tosti,</hi> and <hi>Gyrth,</hi> being present, they immediately removed him into the King's Chamber, hoping it was but a sudden Fit, and would be speedily over; but he lay in that languishing condition four days, and died on the fifth. This is the account of his Death; to which the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Monks, and such as write in favour of them, add other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, which shew either his Guilt, or their Malice; since they relate, That mention being made by somebody at the King's Table, of <hi>Alfred</hi> his late Brother, he thereupon looked very angrily at Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> when
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93814:302" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he to vindicate himself told King <hi>Edward,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLIII.</note> He perceived that upon the least mentioning of that Prince, he cast a frowning Countenance upon him; <hi>But</hi> (saith he) <hi>let not God suffer me to swallow this Morsel, if I am guilty of any thing done either toward the taking away his Life, or against your Interest:</hi> After which words, being presently choaked with the Bit he had just before put into his Mouth, he sunk immediately down, and never recovered more. But let the manner of his death be as it will, he was a Man of an Active and Turbulent Spirit, not over-nicely conscientious either in getting or keeping what he could; not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused for his too much forcing his Sovereign to whatever he listed: But had he not been so great a Lover of his Countrey, and an Enemy to Strangers, those that wrote in the <hi>Norman</hi> times (and who durst not write any thing but what they knew would please their Masters) would have passed him over without this Story, and have given him a fairer Character.</p>
               <p>His first Wife was the Sister of King <hi>Cnute,</hi> by whom he had a Son; but in his Infancy happening to mount an unruly Horse that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented him by his Grandfather, he was run away with into the <hi>Thames,</hi> and there drowned. His Mother was kill'd by Thunder, which (as then was believed) fell upon her as a Judgment, on the account of her great Cruelty; for she made a Trade of selling handsome <hi>English</hi> Boys and Girls into <hi>Denmark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After her Death Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> married another Wife, and by her had Six Sons, <hi>viz. Harold, Sweyn, Wined, Tosti, Gyrth,</hi> and <hi>Leofwin:</hi> His Earldom of <hi>West-Sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> was given to his Son <hi>Harold</hi>; and the Earldom that <hi>Harold</hi> had before, viz. <hi>Essex,</hi> was conferred on <hi>Alfgar</hi> the Son of <hi>Leofric,</hi> Earl of <hi>Mercia</hi>; which is also confirmed by our <hi>Annals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the same year, according to <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham, Rees</hi> the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Griffyn</hi> King of <hi>South-Wales,</hi> being taken Prisoner, for the many Insolences he had committed against the <hi>English,</hi> was by the Command of King <hi>Edward</hi> put to death at a place called <hi>Bulendun,</hi> and his Head sent to the King then lying at <hi>Gloucester,</hi> on the Vigil of <hi>Epiphany:</hi> But this is omitted in the <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicles, as commonly every thing is that makes to the disadvantage of their own Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This year <hi>Leo,</hi> that Holy Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> deceased,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLIV.</note> and <hi>Victor</hi> was elected in his stead. And there was also so great a Murrain of all sorts of Cattel in <hi>England,</hi> that none could ever remember the like.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And now, according to the <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicles, <hi>Griffyth</hi> the Son of <hi>Ratherch ap Justin,</hi> raised a great Army both of Strangers and others, against <hi>Griffyth</hi> Prince of <hi>North Wales,</hi> who delaying no time, but getting all the Forces of that Countrey together, and meeting the other, <hi>Griffyth</hi> fought with him and slew him on the place, though none of these Chronicles have told us where that was. This was the last Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion or <hi>Welsh</hi> Civil War that happened in this Prince's Reign.</p>
               <p>The same year (according to <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> and <hi>Roger Hove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) Siward,</hi> that Valiant Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> at the Command of King <hi>Edward,</hi> being attended with a powerful Army and a strong Fleet, marched into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to restore <hi>Malcolm</hi> the Right Heir to the Crown of that Kingdom, where joining Battel with <hi>Macbeth,</hi> the then Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping King of <hi>Scots,</hi> many both of that Nation, and of the <hi>Normans</hi> who took their part, were slain, and the Earl put the Usurper to flight. But in this Battel the Earl's Son, and several of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> were slain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:93814:303"/>

                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLIV.</note>
                  <hi>H. Huntington</hi> further adds, That when the News was brought to the Earl, of the Death of his Son, he presently asked, <hi>Whether he had received the Wound behind or before?</hi> And being told it was <hi>before,</hi> he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly replied, <hi>I am glad to hear that, for so it became my Son to dye.</hi> He says also, That this Son of his (whom he does not name) had been sent into <hi>Scotland</hi> before his Father, and was there killed; and that Earl <hi>Siward</hi> did not subdue <hi>Macbeth</hi> till the second Expedition; in which he differs from all the rest of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotish</hi> Historians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Buchanan</hi> indeed acknowledges, that this Prince <hi>Malcolm</hi> having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Refuge in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> obtain'd of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Assistance of Ten thousand men under the Conduct of Earl <hi>Siward,</hi> and that the rest were raised for him by <hi>Macduf</hi> and others of his Party that took Arms on his behalf. But <hi>John Fordun</hi> in his History writes much more improbably; and though he allows that King <hi>Edward</hi> offered <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm</hi> an Army sufficient to place him on the Throne, yet that he refused it with Thanks, and only took Earl <hi>Siward</hi> of all the <hi>English</hi> Lords along with him; as if this Earl's single Might, though he was a Man of great Strength and Stature, signified any thing against the Forces of <hi>Macbeth,</hi> unless he had also brought a powerful Army along with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mat. Westminster</hi> also adds, That <hi>Scotland</hi> being thus conquered by the Forces of King <hi>Edward,</hi> he bestowed it upon King <hi>Malcolm,</hi> to be held of himself: But since this is not found in any of our Ancient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians, and this Author does not acquaint us from whence he had it, I do not look upon it as worthy of any great Credit.</p>
               <p>About this time (according to <hi>Simeon) Aldred</hi> Bishop of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> was sent Ambassador to the Emperor with Noble Presents; and being received with great Honour by him, as likewise by <hi>Herman</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Cologne,</hi> he staid in <hi>Germany</hi> a whole year, to prevail with the <hi>Emperor</hi> on the King's behalf to send Ambassadors into <hi>Hungary,</hi> to bring back Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the King's Cousin, Son of King <hi>Edmund Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,</hi> into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same year also, according to the <hi>Latin</hi> Copy of the <hi>Annals,</hi> 'Was a Battel at <hi>Mortimer</hi> in <hi>Normandy.</hi>] But though they do not tell us by whom it was fought, yet from others we learn it was between <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the King of <hi>France</hi>; where the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer obtain'd a most signal Victory.</p>

                  <q>This year <hi>Siward</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> deceased; and the King gave that Earldom to <hi>Tostig,</hi> Son of Earl <hi>Godwin.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Of this <hi>Siward</hi>'s death, our Historians give us divers remarkable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances; That being near his End by a Bloody-Flux, he said, He was asham'd to dye thus like a Beast; so causing himself to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly Armed, and taking his Sword in his hand (as if he would have fought even Death it self) he in this Posture expired, as he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, like a Man of Honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>King <hi>Edward</hi> not long after this summoned a <hi>Witena Gemot</hi> (or Great Council) seven days before <hi>Midlent,</hi> wherein Earl <hi>Aelfgar</hi> was outlaw'd upon a Charge of being a Traytor to the King and the whole Nation; and of this he was convicted before all there assembled. Then Earl <hi>Aelfgar</hi> went to the Castle of Prince <hi>Griffyn</hi> in <hi>North-Wales</hi>; and the same year they both together burnt the City of <hi>Hereford,</hi> with the Monastery of St. <hi>Aethelbert,</hi> (once King of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> whose Bones were here enshrin'd.)</q>

                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:93814:303" rendition="simple:additions"/>This Earl had the greater reason to do what he did,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLV.</note> having been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly banish'd, as most of our Historians write. <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> is somewhat larger in his account of this Affair; and says, That this Earl <hi>Aelfgar</hi> first went to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and there procuring Eighteen Pyrate-Ships, sail'd with them into <hi>Wales</hi> to assist Prince <hi>Griffyn</hi> against King <hi>Edward,</hi> where joining with the <hi>Welshmen,</hi> they laid waste the Countrey about <hi>Hereford</hi> with Fire and Sword; against whom was sent that Cowardly Earl <hi>Rodolph,</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Sister's Son; who gathering an Army, and meeting with the <hi>Welshmen</hi> about two miles from that City, he commanded the <hi>Englishmen</hi> (contrary to their custom) to fight on Horseback; but so soon as they were ready to join Battel, <hi>Rodulph</hi> with all his <hi>Frenchmen</hi> ran away; which the <hi>English</hi> seeing, quickly followed: By which you may see, that it is no new thing for a Cowardly General to make Cowardly Soldiers.</p>
               <p>The Victory being thus easily obtained, the Prince and the Earl entred <hi>Hereford,</hi> and having killed seven of the Chanons that defended the doors of the Church, they burnt it, together with the Monastery above-mention'd, with all the Reliques of St. <hi>Aethelbert,</hi> and the Rich Ornaments that were in it; and so having slain divers of the Citizens, and carried away great Numbers of them Prisoners, they returned home laden with Booty: But as soon as the King was acquainted with it, he presently commanded an Army to be raised through all <hi>England</hi>; which being mustered at <hi>Gloucester,</hi> He appointed the Valiant Earl <hi>Harold</hi> to be Commander in chief; who obeying the King's Orders, immediately pursued Prince <hi>Griffyn</hi> and Earl <hi>Aelfgar,</hi> and entring the Borders of <hi>Wales,</hi> pitched his Camp beyond <hi>Straetdale,</hi> as far as <hi>Snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>; but they who knew him to be a Brave and Warlike Commander, not daring to engage him, fled into <hi>South-Wales</hi>; which <hi>Harold</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, left there the greater part of his men, with Orders to fight the Enemy if they could come at them; and with the rest he returned to <hi>Hereford,</hi> which he fortified by drawing a new Trench about it. But whilst he was thus employed, the two Captains on the contrary side thinking it best for them to make Peace, sent Messengers to him, and at last procuring a Meeting at a place called <hi>Byligeseage,</hi> a firm Peace and Friendship was there concluded; in pursuance whereof Earl <hi>Aelfgar</hi> sent his Ships to <hi>Chester</hi> till they could be paid off, and he himself went up to the King, from whom he received his former Earldom.</p>

               </p>
               <p>All this, though done in the two following years, is here related all at once: But <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> are much more large in their Account of these <hi>Welsh</hi> Affairs, which they give us under the following year, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Griffyn</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> having by his frequent Inroads highly exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated King <hi>Edward,</hi> being then at <hi>Gloucester,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLXIV.</note> he after the <hi>Christmas</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidays from thence dispatch'd Earl <hi>Harold</hi> against him with a strong Party of Horse, if possible, to surprize him; yet he got timely notice of his coming, and by that means made a shift to escape; but left behind him most of his Ships, which the Earl taking, commanded to be burnt, and so returned into <hi>England:</hi> But about <hi>Rogation</hi> Week, <hi>Harold</hi> having got a Fleet in readiness, he set sail from <hi>Bristol,</hi> and compassing the greatest part of <hi>Wales,</hi> joined himself to the Horse, with which his Brother <hi>Tostige</hi> met him, and did so much mischief in <hi>Wales,</hi> that tho Prince <hi>Griffyn</hi> had mustered up an Army to oppose them, yet the <hi>Welsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> being thus hard put to it, at last yielded themselves to Earl <hi>Harold,</hi> delivering up Hostages, and consented to pay him Tribute, and absolutely renounced <hi>Griffyth</hi> their Prince. So that not long after, Prince <hi>Griffyth</hi> being betrayed by his own People, was by them murthered; and his Head being cut off, was sent to Earl <hi>Harold,</hi> together with the Gilded Stern of his Ship; all which the Earl immediately caused to be carried to the King.</p>
               <p>Thus fell <hi>Griffyth ap Lhewelyn,</hi> to whom the <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicles give a Noble Character, of a Valiant and Generous Prince, who had been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto for the most part victorious in all his Undertakings, till now he perished by the Treachery of his own Servants.</p>

                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLXIV.</note>After this, King <hi>Edward</hi> (as <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> relates) made <hi>Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen</hi> and <hi>Rithwalla</hi> (whom the <hi>Welsh</hi> Chronicles call <hi>Blethyn</hi> and <hi>Rith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallen</hi>) Joint-Princes of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> being Half-Brethren to <hi>Griffyth</hi> the last Prince on the Mother's side, as being Sons to <hi>Angharat</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Meredyth</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> also adds, That these <hi>Welsh</hi> Princes above-mentioned, when they received from the King this Grant of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> swore Fealty not only to Him, but also to Earl <hi>Harold,</hi> who it seems delivered it to them; swearing to perform their Commands both by Sea and Land, and to pay those Tributes which had been formerly paid to King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Predecessors. Which, if true, shews that Earl <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold</hi> was already adopted and declared Heir of the Crown. But this being not found in our Annals, nor in any other Historian, I cannot pass my word for the Truth of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This year also (according to the <hi>Annals)</hi> the <hi>Northumbers</hi> took Arms against <hi>Tostige</hi> their Earl, and slew as many of his Servants as they could lay hold on, as well <hi>English</hi> as <hi>Danes</hi>; they also seized upon all his Arms that were in <hi>York,</hi> and his Treasure where ever they could find it, and then sent for Earl <hi>Morchar,</hi> the Son of Earl <hi>Aelfgar,</hi> and chose him for their Earl; who then marched <hi>Southward</hi> with all that <hi>Province,</hi> as also all the men of <hi>Snotingaham, Deorbie,</hi> and <hi>Lincolna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scires,</hi> till they came even to <hi>Northamtune,</hi> where his Brother <hi>Eadwin</hi> with all his Company met him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But there Earl <hi>Harold</hi> came against them, to whom they sent a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, which they desired might be conveyed to the King, as also the Messengers, by whom they besought to let them have <hi>Morchar</hi> for their Earl: The King hereupon granting their Request, afterwards sent Earl <hi>Harold</hi> to them to <hi>Hamtune,</hi> at the Feast of St. <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Jude,</hi> farther assuring them of it; and he also at their request confirmed and renewed the Laws of King <hi>Cnute.</hi> But the <hi>Northern</hi> men had done much damage to the Countrey about <hi>Hamtune,</hi> whilst their Message was thus transacting; for they slew their Men, and burnt the Houses and Corn, and took away several Thousand Head of Cattel, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with some Hundreds of Men, whom they carried Captives into the <hi>North</hi>-Parts; so that this Country; and the others adjacent, felt the damage for many years after. But Earl <hi>Tostige,</hi> with his Wife and as many as were of their Party, went over to Earl <hi>Baldwin,</hi> where they tarried all that Winter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The occasion of which Insurrection (as <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> inform us) was this; There was one <hi>Gospatrick</hi> a great Officer in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> with whom Earl <hi>Tostige</hi> having a Quarrel, his Sister Queen <hi>Edgitha</hi> caused him to be murthered at Court the <hi>Christmas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; though this seems very unsuitable to the Meek and Pious Temper of this good Queen: Yet however, so much is certain, That this <hi>Gospa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi> being slain, the Earl also killed in his own Lodgings two of his Friends, <hi>viz. Gammel</hi> the Son of <hi>Orne,</hi> and <hi>Vlf</hi> the Son of <hi>Dolphin,</hi> having treacherously drawn them thither; and had besides laid intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Impositions on the People; all which so incensed them against him, that three or four of the principal <hi>Thanes</hi> of that Countrey, <hi>viz.

                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLXIV.</note> and the day following above Two hundred more of his men, on the <hi>North</hi>-side of the River <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: Tostige</hi> hereupon made loud Complaints to the King, and at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest <hi>Harold</hi> his Brother and others were appointed to take up the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness; but as they were going down into the <hi>North</hi> for this purpose, the whole Countrey in a manner rose, and met them at <hi>Northampton,</hi> where (as also afterwards at <hi>Oxford)</hi> they strenuously refused to receive Earl <hi>Tostige,</hi> and by no means would admit of a Reconciliation: And so violent were they, and resolute, that after the Feast of <hi>All-Saints,</hi> they caused both him and his Adherents to be banished the Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> also adds the reason which the <hi>Northumbers</hi> gave to justify this their Rising, <hi>viz. That they were Freemen born, and as freely educated; and that they would not endure the Insolence of an Earl; for they had learned from their Ancestors to chuse either Liberty or Death.</hi> In short, if the King meant to have them still his Subjects; he should set Earl <hi>Morchar</hi> over them, and then he should soon find they could, if kindly used, willingly submit.</p>
               <p>This was the most probable occasion of <hi>Tostige</hi>'s Banishment: Tho <hi>H. Huntington</hi> (who lived after the Conquest, and had heard many Tales of the Hatred which Earl <hi>Godwin</hi>'s Sons bore to each other) tells us another story of this matter; <hi>viz.</hi> That as the King sate at Dinner at <hi>Windsor,</hi> he commanded Earl <hi>Harold</hi> to serve him with the Cup: <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stige</hi> his Brother being present, and not able to endure that his younger Brother should be preferred before himself, in the King's very presence flew in his face, and catching him by the hair, flung him on the ground: The Scuffle being ended, the King foretold that their Destruction was nigh, and that the Wrath of God would not much longer be deferred: For, says this Author, they were come to that height of Barbarism and Cruelty, that if they but liked the House or Possessions of any one, they would by night procure the Owner to be murthered, with all his Children, to get his Estate; and these were at that time the chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticiaries of the Kingdom. But this seems to have been a story invented long since out of hatred to the Memory of <hi>Harold,</hi> afterwards King, for he hath the Character of a Valiant and Worthy Prince; and who (as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> relates) in this Quarrel with the <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> preferred the Peace of his Countrey to his Brother's private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Tostige</hi> in a great Rage leaving the Court, went to a House at <hi>Hereford,</hi> where at that time he heard his Brother <hi>Harold</hi> had order'd mighty Preparations for the Entertainment of the King, and there made a most terrible havock of his Servants; divers of whom being killed, he flung their mangled Members into all the Vessels of Wine, Mead, Ale, and other Liquors, and then sent word to his Brother, That he need take no care for Pickled Meats, but as for all other sorts he might bring them down along with him: And it was therefore for this most horrid Villany, that the King commanded him to be banished; which the <hi>Northumbers</hi> understanding, for this as well as several other Murthers he had committed, they expell'd him their Countrey, as hath been already shewn. But this does not well agree with what <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> hath already with more probability related of him; for if Earl <hi>Tostige</hi> had been found guilty of so great an Insolence, and that he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93814:306"/>
banished the Kingdom,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLXIV.</note> it had certainly been very needless for the <hi>Northumbers</hi> to have rose up against him, and to have driven him out of the Countrey, or at least to have desired another Earl in his room; since the King would have appointed them a new one, without giving them so just an Occasion for a Rebellion against him.</p>
               <p>To this year also we may refer Earl <hi>Harold</hi>'s going over into <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> which some of our Historians place a year or two sooner; but they differ much more about the manner and occasion of it, some making it to be a meer Casualty, others saying it was on purpose: But <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi>'s account of it is thus; That <hi>Harold</hi> being at his House at <hi>Bosenham</hi> in <hi>Sussex,</hi> near the Sea-side, he for his Recreation with some of his Retinue, took a Fisher-boat, meaning only to row up and down; but sailing a little further to Sea than they were aware, a Tempest rose and carried them cross the Channel to the <hi>French</hi> Coast, where (glad to be safe any where) they were forced to land in the Territories of the Earl of <hi>Ponthieu</hi>; the men of that Countrey (according to their custom, and that barbarous practise which is in use in most places, to make a Prey of the distressed and shipwrack'd) presently fell upon them, and being many and well arm'd, they easily seiz'd upon Earl <hi>Harold</hi> and his Followers, who were without Weapons; so that they not only took them Prisoners, but also fetter'd them. Then <hi>Harold</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering with himself what was to be done, hired a Messenger to go to Duke <hi>William,</hi> and acquaint him how he was sent over by the King of <hi>England,</hi> by his Word and Presence to confirm what other lesser Envoys had only whispered; but that he was kept Prisoner, and hinder'd from the discharge of his Message by <hi>Gwido</hi> Earl of <hi>Ponthieu</hi>; and that it would become a man of so great Honour as himself, not to suffer a Villany so derogatory to his Authority, to go unpunished, since he had appealed to his Justice: But if his Liberty was to be purchased with Money, he would willingly pay the Price to Earl <hi>William,</hi> but not to such a mean-spirited man as <hi>Gwido.</hi> Upon this <hi>Harold</hi> by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Duke <hi>William</hi> was soon set at liberty, and sent to Court; where being honourably received, he was also invited to an Expedition into <hi>Little-Britain,</hi> where at that time the <hi>Norman</hi> Duke made War: But by his Wit and Valour he so well approved himself to the Duke, that he was very much taken with him; to whom, that he might also the more endear himself, he promised by Oath, That in case King <hi>Edward</hi> died, he would deliver up to him the Castle of <hi>Dover,</hi> which was then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Command, and procure him to succeed in the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> Hereupon the Duke's Daughter, as yet too young for Marriage, was betrothed to him; and so he was sent home with very rich Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents.</p>
               <p>This is <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi>'s, and divers other Historians Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; but <hi>Bromton</hi>'s Chronicle, as he is singular in many things, so he is in this, and relates the Cause of <hi>Harold</hi>'s Voyage into <hi>Normandy</hi> thus; <hi>viz.</hi> That he had asked leave of King <hi>Edward</hi> to go over to Duke <hi>William,</hi> to procure him to set his Brother <hi>Wulnoth,</hi> and his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Hacune</hi> free, who were there detain'd as Hostages; whereupon the King told him he might go with his Leave, but not by his Advice; for (said he) I foresee that nothing but Damage and Ruin can happen to <hi>England</hi> thereby; for I know Earl <hi>William</hi> will not be so ignorant and impolitick as to grant their Delivery, unless it shall tend to his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage:
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93814:306" rendition="simple:additions"/>
So <hi>Harold</hi> going on Shipboard, and intending for <hi>Normandy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLXIV.</note> was driven by a Tempest on the Coast of <hi>Picardy,</hi> and there seized by the Earl of <hi>Ponthieu,</hi> and by him at last was sent to Duke <hi>William,</hi> as hath been already related. The rest of the Story is much the same with the former, and needs no Repetition; only this is added, That Earl <hi>Harold</hi> at his Return home, having told the King all that had happened to him in <hi>France,</hi> the King is said to reply thus, <hi>Did not I tell thee that this Voyage would prove neither for thy Profit, nor that of the Kingdom.</hi> But one may plainly perceive this Story to have been feigned by one of the later Monks, to prove that King <hi>Edward</hi> had the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and would not have been omitted by <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> if he had known it, or thought it to have been true.</p>
               <p>This year also, as <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLXV.</note> 
                  <hi>Harold</hi> Earl of <hi>West-Saxony,</hi> having built a House in <hi>South-Wales,</hi> at a place called <hi>Portascith,</hi> and made great Preparations for the King's Entertainment, who was to come thither a hunting; when <hi>Caradoc,</hi> or <hi>Cradoc,</hi> Son to <hi>Griffyn</hi> Prince of <hi>South-Wales</hi> (whom <hi>Griffyn</hi> Prince of <hi>North-Wales</hi> had slain some years before) came to this place about St. <hi>Bartholomew-day,</hi> and there not only slew all the Workmen and Servants, but carried away all the Goods that had been brought thither.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This year was consecrated the Monastery of <hi>Westminster,</hi>

                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLXVI.</note> on the Feast of the <hi>Holy Innocents.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This Church, as the Abbot of <hi>Rievalle</hi> (in his Life of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward)</hi> informs us, had been begun some years before, in performance of a Vow the King had formerly made, to go to <hi>Rome</hi>; but being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded from it by the Chief Men of his Kingdom, he sent thither <hi>Aldred</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Herman</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Pope <hi>Leo</hi>'s Dispensation from that Journey, who by the said Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops returned it him upon these terms, That he should bestow the Money he would have spent in that Voyage, in building a Stately Church and Monastery in Honour of St. <hi>Peter:</hi> Whereupon the King chose out a place near his own Palace, where had anciently stood a Church and Monastery, built by <hi>Sebert</hi> King of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Mellitus</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> but it being destroyed by the <hi>Danes,</hi> had ever since lain in Ruins.</p>
               <p>But an Ancient Epitome of <hi>English</hi> Chronicles, written by a Monk of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and now in the <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Otho, D.</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library, relates, That Archbishop <hi>Dunstan</hi> had here before erected a small Monastery for Twelve Monks, which was vastly augmented by King <hi>Edward:</hi> Though whether this were so or no, is as uncertain, as it is incredible what these <hi>Monkish</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters tell us, of its being anciently consecrated by St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself; which not being mentioned by <hi>Bede,</hi> looks like a Fable invented only to gain a greater Veneration for that Place.</p>
               <p>Here also, in the Author above-mentioned, follows the King's Letter to Pope <hi>Nicholaus,</hi> That he would please not only to confirm what his Predecessor had done, but also grant him new Privileges for the said Monastery; and then comes the Pope's Bull or Privilege for that purpose, in which is recited this Legend of that Church's having been anciently consecrated by St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> places the Consecration of this Church on the day above-mentioned, yet he refers it to the end of the year 1065, and perhaps with more Exactness; since the <hi>English-Saxon</hi> year

began then not at <hi>Lady-day,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  </note> as Sir. <hi>H. Spelman</hi> informs us) was summoned to confirm the King's Charter of Endowment of the said Monastery; but though it be there imperfect, yet you may find it at large in <hi>Monast. Anglican.</hi>; wherein, after the Recital of the Bull of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> follows this Clause, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That the King, for the Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own Vow, and also for the Souls of the Kings his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, as well as Successors, had granted to that place (viz. <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster)</hi> all manner of Liberty, as far as Earthly Power could reach; and that for the Love of God, by whose Mercy he was placed in the Royal Throne, and now by the Counsel and <hi>Decree</hi> of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops, Bishops, Earls, and other of his Great Men, and for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and Advantage of the said Church, and all those that should belong to it, he had granted these Privileges following, not only in present but for future times: Then follows an Exemption from all Episcopal Jurisdiction; as also another Clause, whereby he grants it the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Sanctuary; so that any one, of whatsoever condition he be, for whatsoever cause, that shall fly unto that <hi>Holy Place,</hi> or the Precincts thereof, shall be free, and obtain full Liberty. And at last concludes thus, <hi>I have commanded this Charter to be written and seal'd, and have also signed it with my hand,</hi> with the Sign of the Cross, and have ordered fit Witnesses to subscribe it for its greater Corroboration: Then immediately follows the King's Subscription, in these words, <hi>Ego Edwardus, Deo largiente, Anglorum Rex, signum venerandae Crucis impressi.</hi> Then follows the Subscription of Queen <hi>Editha,</hi> with those of the two Archbishops seven of the Bishops, and as many Abbots; and so comes on the Subscriptions of the Laity, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Raynbald</hi> the Chancellor, and of the Earls <hi>Harold</hi> and <hi>Edwin,</hi> who write themselves <hi>Duces,</hi> and six <hi>Thanes,</hi> besides other of inferior Order.</q> This Charter bears date on St. <hi>Innocents</hi> day, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1066. which how it could be so dated four days before <hi>New-years-day,</hi> when the year then began, I do not understand.</p>
               <p>Here also follows a Third Charter, which is much the same with the former, only it contains the King's Letter to Pope <hi>Nicholaus,</hi> and his Bull, reciting the Privileges granted to the said Church; all which are there at large inserted. Then follows the Subscriptions of the King, Queen, Archbishops, Bishops, Earls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> almost in the same order as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; only <hi>Osbald</hi> and another of the King's Chaplains do here subscribe before any of the Lay-Nobility; and besides the <hi>Thanes,</hi> there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral who subscribed with the Title of <hi>Milites</hi> added to their Names.</p>
               <p>I have been the larger upon this Foundation, not only because it was the Greatest and Noblest of any in <hi>England,</hi> but also for that it still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, though under another Title, to be a Collegiate Church for a Dean and Eight Prebends, with an excellent School belonging to it, which hath hitherto furnished both the Church and State with as great a number of Learned and Considerable Persons, as any in the whole Nation.</p>

But when the King replied to them, That he would admonish his People to repent them of the evil of their ways and doings, and then he hoped God would not bring these dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Judgments upon them, but would again receive them into his Mercy: To this they answered, That now it could not be, because the hearts of this people were hardened, and their eyes blinded, and their ears stopped, so that they would neither hear those that would instruct them, nor be advised by those that should admonish them, being neither to be terrified by his Threatnings, nor melted by his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits. And the King asking them when there would be an end of all these Judgments, and what comfort they might be like to receive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all these great afflictions? those holy men only answered him in a Parable of a certain Green Tree, that should be cut down, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Root about the distance of Three Acres; and when without any human hand the Tree should be restored to its Ancient Root, and flourish and bear Fruit, then, and not till then, was there any Comfort to be hoped for.</q>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLXVI.</note>But this Author's application of the Tree that was to be cut down, to the <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Royal Family's being for a time destroyed; and its Separation to the distance of three Acres, to <hi>Harold</hi> and the two first <hi>Norman</hi> Kings; and its Restitution again, to King <hi>Henry</hi> the first, by his marrying of Queen <hi>Mathildis,</hi> and its flourishing again in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press her Daughter; and then its bearing Fruit, to the Succession of <hi>Henry</hi> the second; do sufficiently shew that great part of this Vision was made and accommodated for the Reigns of these Princes. <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> indeed recites the same Vision, though in fewer words, but without any Interpretation of the Parable. But be this Vision true or false, I think we may have reason to pray to God that neither our Clergy nor Laity, by falling into the like wicked and deplorable state above described, may ever bring the like Judgments upon this Nation.</p>
               <p>But when the Queen, <hi>Robert</hi> the Lord Chamberlain, and Earl <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,</hi> who are said to have been present at the Relation of this Vision, seemed very much concern'd, Archbishop <hi>Stigand</hi> received it with a Smile, saying, That the good Old Man was only delirous by reason of his Distemper; <hi>But</hi> (says <hi>Malmesbury) we have too dearly tried the Truth of this Vision,</hi> England <hi>being now made the Habitation of Strangers, and groaning under the Dominion of Foreigners; there being</hi> (says he) <hi>at this day (i. e.</hi> at the time when he wrote) <hi>no</hi> Englishman <hi>either an Earl, a Bishop, or an Abbot; but Strangers devour the Riches, and gnaw even the very Bowels of</hi> England; <hi>neither is there a prospect of having any End of these Miseries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, it seems, was written in the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> and before he had seen the more Happy Times that succeeded in that of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Second</hi>; when the Abbot above-mentioned tells us, <hi>That</hi> England <hi>had then a King of the Ancient Blood Royal, as also Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Abbots of the same Nation, with many Earls, Barons, and Knights, who as being descended both from the</hi> French <hi>and</hi> English <hi>Blood, were an Honour to the One, and a Comfort to the Other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to come to the Death and Last Words of this most Pious King: The Abbot above-mentioned gives us an Excellent Discourse which he made before his Death, recommending the Queen to her Brother, and the Nobility there present, and highly extolling her Chastity and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; who though she appeared publickly his Wife, yet was privately rather like a Sister or Daughter; desiring of them, That whatsoever he had left her for her Jointure, should never be taken from her. He also recommended to them his Servants who had followed him out of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> and that they should have their free choice either of returning home to their own Countrey, or staying here. After which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his Body to be buried in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church at <hi>Westminster,</hi> which he had so newly dedicated; and so having received the Blessed Eucharist, and recommended his Soul to God, he quietly departed this Life, having reigned Three and twenty Years, Six Months, and Seven and twenty Days.</p>
               <p>It is very observable, That this Abbot does not tell us that he said any thing concerning who should be his Successor; whereas many of the Monks of those Times make him to have bequeathed the Crown at his Death to his Cousin <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi>; and <hi>Ingulph</hi> further says, That King <hi>Edward</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>me years before his Death had sent <hi>Robert</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> as an Ambassador to him, to let him know
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93814:308" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that he had design'd him his Successor, both because he was of his Blood,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLXVI.</note> and also Eminent for his Virtue.</p>
               <p>What Pretences the Duke might have to the Crown by the latter, I know not, but it is certain the former could give him no Title to it, since all the Relation that was between King <hi>Edward</hi> and Duke <hi>William,</hi> was by Queen <hi>Emma,</hi> who was Mother to the King, and Aunt to the Duke; so that it is evident on the score of this Relation, that Duke <hi>William</hi> could have no pretence by Blood to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is very suspicious, that this Story of Archbishop <hi>Robert</hi>'s being sent into <hi>Normandy</hi> upon this Errand, was but a Fiction, since he sate but three years in that See before his Expulsion, and that happened near ten years before; after which King <hi>Edward</hi> sent over for his Cousin <hi>Edward,</hi> sirnamed <hi>The Outlaw,</hi> to make him his Heir.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> being dead, they made great haste to bury him, for his Funerals were performed the next day with as great Solemnity as the shortness of that time would admit of; but it was sufficient that all the Bishops and Nobility of the Kingdom attended his Body to the Grave in the Church aforesaid, where his Tomb is at this day to be seen behind the Altar; and his Body was afterwards preserved in a Rich Shrine of Gold and Silver, till the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Character which the Writers of the following Age give this Prince, it is such as they thought was due to One whom they took to be a Saint, yet they give him the Title of <hi>Confessor,</hi> which had been in the Primitive Times bestowed only on those who suffered for Christ, though not unto death: but how he could claim that Title upon this Account I know not, unless his resisting the ordinary motions of the Flesh, may be looked upon as such a kind of suffering; having been (as is already related) so chaste, that he never knew his own Wife, though a very Beautiful Lady; for which, as well as his other Virtues, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly his Charity to the Poor, he is commonly stiled St. <hi>Edward the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he was indeed but a Weak and Easy Prince, and so the more lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be drawn away by the false suggestions of those about him; as may be observed in his severe proceedings against his Mother and his Wife: though that very Weakness and Easiness of Nature is in him reckoned for a Virtue, as you may see by this Story, which is related by Abbot <hi>Ailred; (viz.)</hi> That this King <hi>Edward</hi> being one Afternoon laid down upon his Bed to repose himself, and no body left in the Chamber with him, and the Curtains close drawn round about him, there came in by chance a Boy that was employed in the meaner Offices of the House, who seeing no body in the room, and finding there a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Chest open, in which the Chamberlain kept the Money for the King's ordinary Expences, and which had been through negligence forgot to be lock'd, the Boy ran hastily to it, and filling his Pockets, went away with the Money; But the King perceiving him through the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, said nothing, but let him go. The Boy finding he had sped so well, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to go again to make the best of his time, and having laid by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney he had stolen, came again to fetch more; whereupon the King think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him then a little too bold, called out to him, saying, <hi>Sirrah, you had best be contented with what you have got, for if</hi> Hugolin <hi>come</hi> (for so was the Chamberlain call'd) <hi>he will not only whip you soundly, but likewise take away all you have purloined already.</hi> The Boy hearing a Voice, but seeing no body, ran
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93814:309"/>
away in a great fright,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLXVI.</note> and the King concerned himself no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about it; but <hi>Hugolin</hi> coming in not long after, and finding both the Chest open, and a good deal of Money taken out of it, was in a great Passion; which the King taking notice of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bid him rest contented; <hi>For,</hi> said he, <hi>the Poor Rogue that hath it, wants it more than we do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that, upon the whole, I think we may safely rely upon <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi>'s Character of this Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That if you consider his Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, he seemed very unfit for Government; yet by reason of his Virtue, and Piety towards God, he was so directed by him, that the most Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Couragious Kings have scarce ruled more happily: For during his Reign the Kingdom was never i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vaded by Foreign Enemies; nor were there any Civil Disturbances, but what were immediately sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
               <p>But though the Abbot of <hi>Rievalle,</hi> who hath wrote his Life, hath also given us a long Bed-roll of his Miracles, which I shall not take upon me to relate, yet cannot but take notice of one or two of them; how it is said, that he cured some blind People, by only washing their Eyes with fair Water, in which his own Fingers had been first dipped; and that he also healed a Woman who had been grievously over-run with those Swellings we now call the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Evil,</hi> by his bare washing the Sores with his own hands; and from whose Blessing, or Example (I will not dispute) the Touch of our Kings of <hi>England</hi> have ever since been thought very effectual for curing the <hi>King's-Evil.</hi> But among these Miracles, this seems not the least, That this Author makes him to have been <hi>Elected</hi> King by his Father's Command, and that in a Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, whilst he was yet in his Mother's Belly.</p>
               <p>As for his private Recreations, he loved Hawking and Hunting above all the rest; and would be in a Passion, if he had been crossed in his Game: For a Countrey Clown once spoiling his Sport, the King riding up to him, as if he would have beat him, only said, <hi>By God's-Mother, I would be even with you if I could.</hi> He is said not to be excessive at his private Meals, nor at solemn Festivals was he at all elated with the Costly Robes he wore, which his Queen curiously embroidered for him with Silk and Gold. And being thus Mild, Charitable, and Beneficent to all his People, it was no wonder if his Death was so deeply lamented by all his Subjects. But this they grant to be his Fault, that he brought too many <hi>Normans</hi> over with him into <hi>England</hi>; and they having great Offices and Preferments bestow'd upon them, soon corrupted the then <hi>English</hi> Simplicity by their <hi>Norman</hi> Customs: So that as <hi>Ingulph</hi> well observes, the <hi>English</hi> Nobility growing as it were ashamed of their own, began to imitate the <hi>French</hi> Manners; the generality of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen speaking the <hi>French</hi> Tongue in their Houses, (as being then most modish) and made their Charters and other Writings after the <hi>French</hi> way; and this humour still more and more prevailed, till at length they became as it were Slaves and Vassals to those they before so extremely admired. So true a Maxim is it, generally speaking, that where a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Tongue prevails, it is reckoned half a Conquest.</p>
               <p>As for this King's Person, he is described to be Tall and Comely, of a very Fair and Ruddy Complexion; and in his latter years Venerable for his long and white Beard, as you may see in his Seals and Pictures: And which is most remarkable, he was the first <hi>English</hi> King whose Seals we can find affixed to his Charters, as you may see in Mr. <hi>Speed:</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:93814:309" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Yet perhaps other Kings might have Seals to their Charters before him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLXVI.</note> however they are now defaced.</p>
               <p>But though this King made many excellent Laws, which being wrote in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue, are now almost quite lost; yet since some Heads or Extracts of them are to be found in <hi>R. Hoveden,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi>'s Collections, I shall give you such of them as are necessary for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Ancient Constitution, and for shewing what liberty the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Subjects enjoyed before the Conquest; which Laws were also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by King <hi>William</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> in the Fourth Year of his Reign; but they not specifying any time when they were made, I have referr'd them to this place.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The first of these Laws establishes the Goods and Possessions of all Clerks and Scholars.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>The second appoints the times and days of the King's Peace; making it more Penal to violate it from the <hi>Advent</hi> of our Lord, to the Octaves of the <hi>Epiphany</hi>; and in like manner from <hi>Lent</hi> to the Octaves of <hi>Easter, (i. e.</hi> eight days after that Feast); and from our Lord's <hi>Ascension,</hi> to the Octaves of <hi>Pentacost</hi>; and also on all <hi>Saturdays,</hi> from Nine a Clock, to the <hi>Monday</hi> morning following; likewise on the Vigils of all Holidays, as well as on the Holidays themselves; as also in Parishes, when the Feast of the Saint (to whom the Church is dedicated) is kept; so that if any one come devoutly to the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration thereof, he was to have security in going, staying, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home; and besides in many other cases, too long here to set down.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From whence we may observe the Antiquity of those Parish Feasts, called in several parts of <hi>England, Wakes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The fourth appoints, That where ever the King's Justice, or any other Person shall hold Civil Pleas, if the King's Deputy or Attorney comes thither to open any Cause concerning Holy Church, that shall be first determined; for it is just God be served before all others.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The fifth ordains, That whosoever holds any thing of the Church, or hath his Mansion on the Church's Land, he or they shall not be compell'd to plead out of the Ecclesiastical Courts, for Contumacy or otherwise (nay, though he forfeit) unless Justice be wanting in those Courts, which (says the Law) God forbid.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By which all the Tenants of the Church were exempted from plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or appearing at the King's Courts; which though a strange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable Privilege, yet (it seems) it continued in the time of <hi>William</hi> the <hi>First.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The sixth confirms the Laws of Sanctuaries, ordaining, That no man shall be taken out of any Church to which he hath fled for any offence, unless it be by the Bishop or his Officers: The like Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege is also allowed to the Priest's House, provided it stand upon the Ground of the Church; but if a Thief went out of the Sanctuary to rob, he was to forfeit that Privilege.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The seventh leaves those to the Justice of the Bishop who violate the Peace of Holy Church; and if any Offender shall despise his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, either by flying or contemning it, and Complaint thereof be made to the King after forty days, he shall give Pledges to reconcile himself to God, the King, and the Church; and if he cannot be found, he shall be outlaw'd; and if then he be found, and can be laid

               <p>

               </p>
               <p>From which you may observe, that this Law of <hi>Ordeal</hi> was in force some time after the coming in of the <hi>Normans.</hi> This Law also ordains in what Cases, and over what Persons, the Courts Baron should have Jurisdiction; but it being somewhat large, I refer you to it.</p>

                  <q>The twelfth shews what <hi>Danegelt</hi> was, and on what occasion it was first imposed: That the payment of <hi>Danegelt</hi> was first ordained because of the frequent Invasions of the <hi>Danish</hi> Pyrates; to repress which, there was Twelvepence imposed upon every Hide of Land throughout <hi>England,</hi> to be paid yearly: Which also shews us about what time these Laws were collected into the form we now have them by this Clause, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Church was excused from this pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment until the time of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> who (as is here recited) asking an Aid of his <hi>Barons</hi> for the obtaining <hi>Normandy</hi> from his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then going to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> there was granted to him (not by any standing Law, but only for the present necessity.) Four Shillings upon every Hide of Land, the Church not excepted.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>The thirteenth sets forth, That the Peace of the King is manifold, as sometimes it is given by his own hand, which the <hi>English</hi> call <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges honde sealde gryth.</hi>

               <p>This Protection was granted not only to Persons, but Places also, by way of Privilege, as likewise to Churches or Churhmen within their own Walls, as appears by the League betwixt King <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Guth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> in which it is termed <hi>Cyninges honde gryth.</hi>

                  <q>The fourteenth declares, That all <hi>Treasure prove</hi> should be the King's, unless it were found in a Church or Church-yard; in which case, if it were Gold, it was all the King's; but if Silver, one half was to go to him, and another to the Church.</q>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The sixteenth Article shews us, how this way of discovering Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and punishing the Hundred, came to be in use where the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer could not be found; <hi>viz.</hi> That King <hi>Cnute,</hi> when he had gotten <hi>England,</hi> and settled it in Peace, and at the request of the <hi>English</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons had sent back his Army into <hi>Denmark,</hi> those Barons became Sureties, that all the <hi>Danes</hi> that staid behind with him, should in all things enjoy perfect Peace; so that in case an <hi>Englishman</hi> kill'd any of them, if he could not clear himself by the Judgment of God, (that is, by Water or Iron, meaning the <hi>Ordeal)</hi> Justice was to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon him; and in case he ran away, Payment was to be made as is aforesaid.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Law, to prevent the killing of the <hi>Normans,</hi> was likewise conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by King <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror</hi>; for in case a man were found slain, he was to be taken for a <hi>Norman,</hi> and his Death to be more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously punished than that of an <hi>Englishman,</hi> unless the <hi>Englescherie</hi> of him that was killed could be made out before the King's Justices; that is, that he was an <hi>Englishman,</hi> as <hi>Bracton</hi> hath particularly shewn us. But I shall reserve the speaking further of this Law to the next Volume.</p>

                  <q>The seventeenth declares the Office of a King in these words; The King, who is the Vicegerent of the Supreme King, is appointed to this very end, That he may Govern and Defend his Earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the People of the Lord, and above all things should reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence his Holy Church, and extirpate evil doers out of it; which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he shall do, not so much as the Name of a King shall remain to him, but he shall utterly lose it, as Pope <hi>John</hi> witnesses.</q>

                  <q>By the three and twentieth King <hi>Edward</hi> forbad all Usurers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in his Kingdom; and if any one were convicted that he exacted Usury, he should forfeit his Goods, and be looked upon as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law'd.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>After which follows in Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi>'s Copy another Law, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the King's Power by Virtue of his Royal Dignity, to pardon Life and loss of Member, but with this Proviso, That the Male-factor make satisfaction to such as he hath injured, according to his power; and besides, find Sureties for his good Behaviour, which if he did not, he was to be banished.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From whence you may observe, That this Prerogative of pardoning in the King, was not to extend to the prejudice of the Party injured, or his Kindred, to whom an Appeal was hereby reserved.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Concerning which, The nineteenth in like manner declares his Royal Prerogative to be such, that the King may set at liberty any Captive or Prisoner, whenever he comes in any City, Borough, Castle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or if he meet him in the way, by his mere Word or Command. Yet was he that was thus set at liberty, bound to make satisfaction to the injured Party: But a Murtherer, Traytor, or one guilty of such like Crimes, altho the King should pardon him as to Life and Member, according to Law, he shall in no wise stay in the Countrey, but shall swear that he will depart to the Sea-coast within a stated time set him by the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and pass over as soon as he can get opportunity of a Ship and Wind; and in case any such prove perjured, and shall stay in the Land

               </p>
               <p>From whence you may observe the Antiquity of the Law for abjuring the Realm for such great Offences to which the King's Pardon did not then absolutely extend. The rest of this Law, which only recites the Penalties for the harbouring or favouring such Malefactors, I omit.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The twenty seventh Article gives leave to harbour a Stranger or Foreigner (whom in <hi>English</hi> they termed <hi>Couth,</hi> or <hi>Vncouth,</hi> that is, known or unknown) as a Guest for two nights; in which space if he transgress, he that harboured him shall not be answerable for him; but if any one be injured, and complaint is made, that it was by the Counsel and Advice of him that lodged him, he shall with two honest Neighbours by Oath purge himself as to the Advice and Fact, or otherwise shall make satisfaction.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The reason whereof was, because after the third night the Law then was such, that this stranger was to be looked upon as one of the Family, and the Master of it was to answer for him if he transgressed.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The twenty eighth appoints how Money or Cattel brought into a Town (and said by him who brought them, that they were found) shall be disposed of, and who shall have the Custody of them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The thirtieth enjoins, That those who have the King's Peace either by his Hand or Letters, shall take care not to injure others, under a double Penalty.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The thirty first declares the particular Mulcts or Penalties of those who shall violate the King's Peace above-mentioned, and especially that of the eight days of his Coronation, or of any of the Feasts aforesaid, and who should have the Forfeitures arising from thence; how much the King, and how much the Earl, and how much the Dean or the Bishop in whose Deanry the Peace was broken.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The thirty sixth Article directs, how that after a man is killed as a Thief or a Robber, if any Complaint be made by his nearest Relation, to the Justice, that the man was wrongfully put to death, and lies bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried among Thieves, and that such Relations offer to make it good, in such case they shall first give security for so doing; and then it follows in what manner the Party slain may be cleared in his Reputation, and what satisfaction shall be made to his Friends for it, in case it appears he was killed unjustly.</q>
               </p>
               <p>These are the Laws which bear the Name of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, though they are not properly so, because many of them were made long before his time, and there are so many things in the <hi>Latin</hi> Original which are rather Explanations of Laws, than Laws themselves, that they more truly seem to have been collected and written by some igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Sciolist,</hi> or pretender, about <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>First</hi>'s time: For though <hi>Roger Hoveden</hi> hath given us this Collection of those Laws which we now have, yet it is plain that there was no Original of them extant at the time when <hi>Hoveden</hi> wrote, nor long before; or else he need not have told us that King <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror in the fourth year of his Reign summoned so many Noble and Wise Men of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, only to enquire into, and acquaint him what those Laws were. But <hi>Bromton</hi>'s <hi>Chronicle</hi> gives us a short History of the several Laws that had been used in <hi>England</hi>; and tells us of three sorts of Laws then in use, viz <hi>Merchenlage, West-Saxonlage,</hi> and <hi>Danelage</hi>; and that King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:93814:312"/>
made one Common Law out of them all,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLXVI.</note> which are called the Laws of King <hi>Edward</hi> to this day; yet of these he gives us no more than the bare Explanation of some Words or Terms frequently used in them, but without setting down any of the Laws themselves; which whether he did out of ignorance, or on purpose, I will not determine; though the former is most likely, seeing he had before given us all the Laws he could meet with of the precedent <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Kings. So that when the Reader hears the Laws of St. <hi>Edward,</hi> so much talked of, and so much contended for after the Conquest, he must not understand these here set down to have been the only Laws above-mentioned; For those are but some parts of them recited and commented upon by after-Writers. And indeed these Laws were first said to be the Laws of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> after the <hi>Normans</hi> coming over, not because King <hi>Edward</hi> made them, but renewed the observance of them; as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> expresly tells us of one of those that King <hi>Cnute</hi> also revived, being in substance the same with that formerly ordained by King <hi>Alfred</hi>; Commanding every one above Twelve years old, to be entred into some <hi>Decenary,</hi> Tything, or Hundred: But <hi>Bracton</hi> also ascribes it to King <hi>Edward:</hi> So likewise this Interpolator or Noter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self tells you, That those Laws of St. <hi>Edward</hi> so much desired, and at length obtained from <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> were ordained in the time of King <hi>Edgar</hi> his Grandfather, but after his death were laid aside for sixty eight years; but because they were just and honest, King <hi>Edward</hi> revived them, and delivered them to be observed as his own.</p>
               <p>By these and other circumstances we may gather, That the whole Body of these Laws we have now recited, were such as were approved and confirmed by King <hi>Edward,</hi> who was a Prince of great Mercy and Indulgence to his People; so that such written Laws as were in force in his time, and such Customs as had been all along observed in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, and had been still kept on foot in his days, were after the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest (when both the People of the <hi>Norman</hi> as well as <hi>English</hi> Extraction so earnestly contended for their Liberties) called by the name of the Laws of St. <hi>Edward,</hi> thereby being indeed meant the <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Laws, which then received Denomination from him, being in effect the last King of that Race, and one whose Memory the People reverenced in an especial manner for the high Reputation he had gained for his great Sanctity and Clemency to his Subjects.</p>

                        <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLXVI.</note> our Annals proceed to tell us, how that Earl <hi>Harold</hi> succeeded in the Kingdom, as King <hi>Edward</hi> had appointed, and that the People elected him to that Dignity; as also that he was anointed King on the Feast of <hi>Epiphany</hi>; but he held the Kingdom only forty weeks and one day.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Laudean</hi> or <hi>Peterburgh</hi> Copy relates it; being written by some Monk that favour'd King <hi>Harold</hi>'s Title to the Crown.</p>
               <p>But <hi>R.

                  <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library. And the relation of this Affair being found no where else, I shall here recite, leaving the Credit thereof to the Reader's Judgment; which is thus: That King <hi>Edward</hi> lying on his Death-bed, Earl <hi>Harold</hi> came to him, and desired him to appoint him for his Successor; to which the King replied, That he had already made Duke <hi>William</hi> his Heir: But the Earl and his Friends still persisting in their Request, the King turning his Face to the Wall, replied thus, <hi>When I am dead, let the</hi> English <hi>make either the</hi> Duke <hi>or the</hi> Earl <hi>their King:</hi> Which, if true, shews that it was but a Consent in part, and was also extorted from him. But this Relation being found in no other Author, I shall not pass my word for the Truth of it.</p>
               <p>But <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and such Writers as prefer the Title of King <hi>William,</hi> tell another story, and say, That King <hi>Harold</hi> on the very day of the King's Funeral having extorted an Oath of Fidelity from the Chief Men, snatch'd up the Crown of his own accord; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>English</hi> say it was bequeathed him by King <hi>Edward</hi>; which yet he says he believes to be rather asserted by them out of partiality, than by any true judgment or knowledge of the thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>H. Huntington</hi> does not mention any such Election of <hi>Harold,</hi> but says on the contrary, that divers of the <hi>English</hi> would have advanced <hi>Edgar Aetheling</hi> to be King. But <hi>Ingulph</hi> is more cautious, and does not determine one way or other of this matter; only says in general, That the day after the King's Funeral, <hi>Harold</hi> wickedly forgetting his Oath which he had formerly made to Duke <hi>William,</hi> intruded himself into the Throne, and was solemnly Crowned by <hi>Alred</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Edgar Aetheling,</hi> the only surviving Male of the Ancient Royal Family, he was but Young, and being a Stranger born, had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Friends nor Interest sufficient to oppose so great a Party as <hi>Harold</hi> had amongst the Lay-Nobility, and especially among the Bishops, who were all to a man for him.</p>

               <p>But to return to our History; <hi>Harold</hi> being thus advanced to the Throne, took that course which all Wise Princes who can claim no Right by Blood, but only by Election of the People, have always ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and that was The abolishing of all unjust Laws, and the making good ones in their stead; the seizing upon and punishing all Thieves, Robbers, and Disturbers of the Publick Peace, and indeed wholly made it his business to defend the Kingdom from Foreign Invaders both by Sea and Land; and that he might become truly popular, he was a great Patron of the Churches and Monasteries, yielding much Reverence to the Bishops and Abbots, shewing himself humble and affable to all that were virtuous and good, as he was severe to all others of a contrary Character.</p>

               <p>King <hi>Harold</hi> being then at <hi>London,</hi> upon notice thereof got in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness both a strong Fleet and a good Party of Horse, with which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in Person to go to <hi>Sandwich</hi> and fight him: But <hi>Tostige</hi> having intelligence of it, took along with him all the Seamen he could find, and went to the Coast of <hi>Lindisse,</hi> where he burnt several Villages, and killed a world of men: But <hi>Edwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Mercia,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Morcar</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> hastening to those parts with an Army, soon forced him to quit that Countrey. And, as <hi>Florence</hi> relates, not being able to return into <hi>Normandy</hi> by reason of contrary Winds, he sail'd into <hi>Norway,</hi> and there join'd his Fleet with that which King <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold Harfager</hi> was now preparing for the Invasion of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time King <hi>Harold</hi> lay at <hi>Sandwich,</hi> expecting his Fleet, which when it was got together, he sail'd to the <hi>Isle of Wight</hi>; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> was now expected to invade <hi>England</hi> with an Army, he waited his coming over all that Summer and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn following, lining all the Sea-Coasts with Land-Forces, in order the better to receive him. This seems indeed more probable, than what

                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLXVI.</note> That King <hi>Harold</hi> did not believe Duke <hi>William</hi> would undertake so hazardous an Expedition, being at that time engaged in Wars with his Neighbouring Princes, and had now wholly given himself up to his Ease and Pleasure; so that had it not been for his hearing that the King of <hi>Norway</hi> likewise threaten'd an Invasion, he would never have raised any Army at all; which seems a very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable story, since he was (as you have already heard from <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham)</hi> forced to get out his Fleet and raise an Army, to prevent the Incursions of his Brother <hi>Tostige.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is fit we now give you some account of the Reasons of these great Preparations made by Duke <hi>William</hi> to invade <hi>England</hi>; for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulph</hi> and the Author last mentioned both assure us, That so soon as he had heard of King <hi>Harold</hi>'s taking upon him the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> contrary to the Oath he had given him, and that he was actually crowned, he sent over Ambassadors to put him in mind of the breach of his word; threatning to force him to perform it, if he would not do it by fair means, and that before the year came about.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Harold</hi>'s Answer to these Ambassadors (as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> relates it) was very plausible, being to this effect, <q>That what he had promised concerning marrying the Duke's Daughter, she being dead, it could not now be performed; but that if he had promised him any thing concerning the Kingdom, it was very rashly done of him, to have given away that which was not his own, <hi>without the General Consent and Decree of the Great Council of that Kingdom</hi>; therefore that a rash Oath was to be broken; for if the Oath or Vow of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, made without the consent of her Parents, was by the Law of God declared void, how much more ought that Oath to be accounted so, which he being then under the Authority of his King (but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd necessity) had made concerning the Kingdom, who was at that time wholly ignorant of what had been transacted? And that the Duke was very unjust in requiring him to resign that Crown which he had so lately received by the General Favour and Consent of the <hi>People.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bromton</hi>'s Chronicle further adds, That Duke <hi>William</hi> sent another Message to King <hi>Harold,</hi> whereby he acquainted him, That although he had not observed his Faith in other things, yet if he would marry his Daughter, he would pass by all the rest; or otherwise would vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Succession by force of Arms. All which is very improbable, since most Historians relate the young Lady to be then dead; and it is very unlikely, that a Man of King <hi>William</hi>'s Ambition would quit his Pretentions to the Kingdom, for so slight a satisfaction as the Marriage of his Daughter.</p>
               <p>But this Author does with more probability reduce the Duke's Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel against <hi>Harold,</hi> to these Three Heads.</p>
               <p>First, To revenge the death of Prince <hi>Alfred</hi> his Cousin, who had been long since murthered by Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> the Father of <hi>Harold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, To restore Archbishop <hi>Robert,</hi> Earl <hi>Odo,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Normans,</hi> who had been unjustly banished in the late King's life-time.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Because <hi>Harold</hi> had contrary to his Oath possessed himself of the Kingdom, which as well by the Right of Consanguinity, as by that of a Double Promise, ought to be his.</p>

                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLXVI.</note>But the Ambassadors of Duke <hi>William</hi> being return'd without any satisfactory Answer from King <hi>Harold,</hi> the Duke employed the rest of the year in preparing all things necessary for his Expedition, hiring Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers out of his own Countrey with large Pay, and inviting Strangers from abroad with greater Allowances; so that upon the Muster of his Forces he found that they did not only excel in strength of Body, and height of Stature, but also the chief Commanders and Captains of them were as remarkable for their Valour as for their Experience and Conduct: Also his Bishops and Abbots strove with the Nobility, who should by their liberal Contributions most advance this Enterprize. But that the Duke might not prejudice the Equity of his Cause by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, he sent Ambassadors to Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> who did with great Eloquence set forth the Justice of the War which their Prince was going to undertake; and that <hi>Harold</hi> not only had broken his Oath with him, but refused to give him any Satisfaction, either because that now he was a Crown'd Head, or else that he distrusted his Cause: Whereupon the Pope taking into his serious consideration this weighty matter, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the Enterprize, and sent the Duke a Consecrated Banner, as an Omen of Victory; which when the Duke had received, he called a Great Council of his Nobility at <hi>Lillebone,</hi> to ask all their Opinions in this great Affair; and when they had all encouraged his Undertaking by great Promises of Assistance, he appointed an Assessment for his Fleet and Army, according to their several respective Estates; and so they departed home, till the time appointed for a General Rendezvouz.</p>

                  </note>But Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> from the Authority of some Ancient <hi>Norman</hi> Writers I have not yet met with, makes this Enterprize much more difficult than our Historians commonly do; as, that though he found his Chief Officers, to whom he communicated his Design, very chearful and resolute to follow him, yet all the Skill lay how to bear the Charge of so great a War; for when in an Assembly of all the States of <hi>Normandy</hi> a Subsidy was propounded; their Answer was, <q>That in the late War against the <hi>French,</hi> their Wealth was so much exhausted, that if a new War should happen, they should scarce be able to hold and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their own; and therefore that they were more obliged to look after the Defence of their own, than to think of Invading the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of others: That this intended War, though never so just, yet did not seem so necessary at that time, as it was apparently hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous; and that besides, the <hi>Normans</hi> were not by their Allegiance bound to Military Service in Foreign Parts:</q> Neither could they by any means be brought to grant a General Tax, although <hi>William Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osbern,</hi> a man in high favour with the Duke, and as gracious among the People, endeavoured what he could to effect it; and to draw in others by his own example, promised to set out forty Ships at his own proper Charges. Duke <hi>William</hi> then perceiving he could not bring this about in a Publick Meeting, went another way to work; and therefore sends for the wealthiest men of his Dutchy severally one by one, to come to him; then he speaks them fair, and desires them to contribute some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what toward this War: Whereupon, as if they had strove who should most largely assist their Prince, they promised him liberally; and he causing to be presently registred whatsoever they had promised, it amounted to a vast Sum, more than most men could reasonably ever have believed.

                  <hi>Maine,</hi> and <hi>Bretaigne</hi>; unto these he promised large Tracks of Land, and great Possessions in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how much each of these Princes contributed to this Expedition, is not known; tho as for <hi>Alan</hi> Earl of <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> he certainly was so great an Assistant to Duke <hi>William,</hi> that he was after this Conquest of King <hi>Harold,</hi> made Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and had great part of the Country thereabouts given him by <hi>William</hi> when he came to be King, to be held by Knights Service.</p>
               <p>And for the rest of the Princes above-mentioned, it is certain that they permitted Duke <hi>William</hi> to raise great store of men in their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, who being headed by divers Noble Volunteers of those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries at their own Charges, afterwards enjoyed great Possessions in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as a Reward of their Services.</p>
               <p>Duke <hi>William</hi> also made his Addresses to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and went in Person to solicite his Assistance in this intended War against <hi>Harold,</hi> voluntarily offering that King, that in case he would assist him, and that he thereby became victorious, to hold <hi>England</hi> of him as his Vassal; which King <hi>Philip</hi> refused to accept, thinking it against the interest of <hi>France</hi> to make the Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> greater than he was already, who now began not to be so pliant to his Interests, as he thought the many Obligations which Duke <hi>William</hi> owed the King his Father, required: Therefore as the growing Greatness of a Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prince was then, is, and will ever be suspected by him who is his Rival in Power and Empire; so King <hi>Philip</hi> was so far from giving the Duke any Assistance, that he wholly dissuaded him from this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, which nevertheless he vigorously pursued, notwithstanding this discouragement.</p>
               <p>But leaving Duke <hi>William</hi> to his Warlike Preparations, we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>England,</hi> where our <hi>Annals</hi> tell us, <q>That Earl <hi>Tostige</hi> had been met upon the <hi>Northern</hi> Coast with three hundred <hi>Norwegian</hi> Ships (commanded by <hi>Harold</hi> King of <hi>Norway)</hi>; to whom when he had joined those he had with them, they all sail'd up the <hi>Humber</hi> till they came as far as <hi>York</hi>; where the Earls (Brothers) <hi>Morcar</hi> and <hi>Eadwin</hi> met and fought them; but it seems the King of <hi>Norway</hi> gain'd the Victory.</q> 
                  <hi>Ingulph</hi> is more express in this affair, and says that <hi>Harold</hi> King of <hi>Norway</hi> sail'd up the River <hi>Ouse</hi> as far as <hi>York,</hi> where the Fleet being left under a strong Guard, they landed, and stormed <hi>York,</hi> and soon plundered it, and slew many of the poor Inhabitants: <q>But the two Earls abovementioned having gotten together a small Recruit of ill-arm'd Countreymen, were easily routed; and (according to our <hi>Annals)</hi> when King <hi>Harold</hi> heard of it, he immediately marched against the King of <hi>Norway,</hi> and meeting him at <hi>Staenford-bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Ingulph</hi> adds, That the <hi>Norwegians</hi> made a very stout resistance, great multitudes of them being slain, together with their Chief Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; so that King <hi>Harold</hi> obtain'd an entire Victory; only Prince <hi>Olave,</hi> Son to <hi>Harold</hi> King of <hi>Norway,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> Earl of <hi>Orcades,</hi> were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted quietly to return home with twenty Ships.</p>
               <p>But before I dismiss this Relation, I cannot omit a remarkable Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of one single <hi>Norwegian,</hi> who standing upon the Bridge above-mentioned, killed more than forty <hi>Englishmen</hi> with his Battel-Axe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>
                  <q>But King <hi>Harold</hi> returning to <hi>York,</hi> had no long time to enjoy his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; for immediately after the News being brought him that Duke <hi>William</hi> was landed at <hi>Pevensey</hi> near <hi>Hastings</hi> upon <hi>Michaelmas</hi> day, he made all the haste he could to march towards him, leaving the Earls <hi>Edwin</hi> and <hi>Morchar</hi> behind him with great part of the Forces.</q> But since our <hi>Annals</hi> are very short in the relation of all these Affairs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Duke</hi> and King <hi>Harold,</hi> I shall give you a larger account of it from <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> and other Authors, who tell us, That Duke <hi>William</hi> with all his Nobility being met in <hi>August</hi> at St. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries</hi> (a Port-Town in <hi>Normandy)</hi> lay there a long while waiting for a Wind, but that continuing contrary for several days, the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at last began thus to murmur in their Camp, (as it is ordinary for such men when they lye long still and have nothing to do), saying among themselves, <hi>That the man was mad who would go to take away another man's Territories against God's Will, which it was plain this was, since he had now so long withheld the Wind.</hi> This being spread abroad, one would have thought it had been enough to have discouraged any one less valiant than the <hi>Duke</hi>; who thereupon consulting with his Chief Officers what was best to be done, the wisest of them advised him to bring forth the Body of St. <hi>Wallerie,</hi> to try if by that means they could obtain a fair Wind; however, perhaps it might put some stop to his Soldiers Discontents. What effect the Saint's Body wrought, I cannot tell; but so much is certain, that not long after a fresh Gale offering, the Duke immediately set sail for <hi>England</hi>; and his Ship being first got out to Sea, casting An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, lay there till the rest of his Fleet could come up to him, who all following the King's Ship (which then rid Admiral) they in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon with an easy and gentle Breeze reached <hi>Hastings,</hi> near which the Duke going on Shore, his foot by accident slipping he fell down, which a Soldier standing by immediately turned into a good Omen, saying, <hi>Sir, you have only taken Seisin of that Land of which you will shortly be King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As soon as ever his Army had landed, he strictly charged them to commit no Outrages, nor plunder, saying, <hi>They ought to spare those things which would shortly be their own:</hi> So the Duke lying still for fifteen days, and having strongly fortified his Camp with certain <hi>Palisadoes</hi> which he had brought over along with him, seemed to mind nothing less than War.</p>
               <p>But King <hi>Harold,</hi> precipitated by his own bad Fortune, marched against the Duke with but part of his Forces; for besides those that had been killed in the late Engagement, a great many of his best Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had already deserted him, being discontented that they had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied their share of the <hi>Norwegian</hi> Plunder; yet those Forces which still remained with him, he thought sufficient, because he heard the Duke was landed but with a small Army; so that notwithstanding the strongest and most valiant of his Army were either slain in the late Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel with the <hi>Norwegians,</hi> or else gone from him, he yet resolved to fight.</p>

They hereupon having set forth the generous Behaviour of the Enemies General, seriously added, That all their Army seemed to be Priests, because they had all their Faces with both their Lips close shaven, for the <hi>English</hi> then wore long Beards: But the King laughing at their simplicity, said, He too well knew those they had seen were no Priests, but brave Soldiers; then <hi>Gyrth</hi> his youngest Brother (being a very young man, but of an Understanding and Courage far above his years) taking the words out of the King's mouth, said thus; <q>Sir, if you can so far allow the Valour of the <hi>Norman</hi> Duke, I think it is then indiscreet for you to enter the Field against him, lest you should be found infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to him either in Strength or Justice of your Cause; for you can no ways deny but that voluntarily or involuntarily you have sworn to him: Therefore in my opinion you would do more prudently to withdraw your self from the present Danger, and leave to us the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of the Day; who being free from all Oaths and Promises, can with a safe Conscience draw our Swords in defence of our Countrey; for it is to be feared, that if you your self should engage, either your Death or more shameful Flight may ensue; whereas if we alone en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with him, your Cause will be every where safe, for you may either assist us if we should be put to fly, or else bury us if we should happen to be slain.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But the King's immoderate Pride and Rashness made him deaf to the wholesome Advice of his Brother; and he thought it Inglorious, and a Dishonour to his past Life, to seem afraid of any Danger: Therefore being push'd on by his unlucky Fate, he hastily sent away the Monk that was newly before come from Duke <hi>William</hi> to him with these Proposals, <hi>viz.</hi> That either he should quit the Throne; or hold it, and reign under him; or else try the Justice of his Cause by their two single Swords in the sight of both Armies; or in case <hi>Harold</hi> should refuse all these, that he was ready to submit it to the Judgment of the Apostolick See: I say, he hastily sent him away with only this short Answer, That he would leave it to God to determine the matter between them.</p>
               <p>So that the Monk being returned with this Answer, it added fresh Courage to the <hi>Normans</hi>; whereupon the Generals on both sides im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately drew up their Armies, in order to a Battel, each according to his Countrey fashion: The <hi>English</hi> had spent the night in drinking and roaring; and being thus heated, marched early out the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against the Enemy: The Pikes and Bill-men, mingled with a strong Detachment of Targetiers, made up the Front and Main Body of the <hi>English</hi> Army, and by their close Order render'd it so impenetrable, that nothing but their being outwitted by the <hi>Norman</hi> Duke could ever have broke it, as you will see by and by: But King <hi>Harold,</hi> together with his Brethren, being all on foot, placed themselves near the Royal

               <p>Whilst in the mean time the <hi>Normans</hi> had spent the night in Prayers and Confessions, and having also received the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> were now drawn out against the <hi>English;</hi> the Foot being armed with Gleaves, Bows, and Arrows, made up the Main Body of their Army; and the Horse being placed a little more backward in two Divisions made the Wings: But (as <hi>Will. Pictaviensis</hi> relates) the Pope's Consecrated Banner was placed in the Front of the Army, as well to encourage the <hi>Normans,</hi> as to dishearten the <hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Duke mounting on Horseback, with an unconcern'd Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and loud Voice encouraged his men, and openly declared, <hi>He doubted not but that God would favour the Justice of his Cause.</hi> And <hi>Bromton</hi>'s Chronicle here brings him in making a long Speech to his Army; which because not suiting with the Genius of those blunt times, and being also omitted by all other Authors, I shall pass by.</p>
               <p>Then the Duke calling for his Armour, and either through haste or incogitancy his Esquire having put on his Breast-plate behind instead of before, he turned off that seeming Ill Omen with a Jest, saying, His Dukedom would shortly be changed into a Kingdom: And then the old Ballad of <hi>Roland</hi> being begun by the Army, that his Martial Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might excite their Courage, and the Divine Assistance being also im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored, the Battel begun, which was valiantly fought on both sides, neither Party giving ground, tho it continued till it was late; which when Duke <hi>William</hi> perceiving, and that the <hi>English</hi> Ranks were not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to be broken, he gave immediate Orders to his men to feign a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and make as if they fled out of the Field, by which Stratagem the Main Body of the <hi>English</hi> Foot being broken in pursuing the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, (whom they thought to be really now put to flight,) it turned to their own destruction; for the <hi>Normans</hi> rallying, and falling upon the <hi>English</hi> when they were dispersed, quite routed them; and thus being outwitted, though they lost their Lives valiantly in fighting for their Countrey, yet were they not wanting in their Revenge, for often turning again, they slew whole heaps of their Pursuers; and the Foot gaining a Rising Ground, drove back the <hi>Normans</hi> into the adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Valley, and throwing great store of Darts and Stones down upon them, put them to flight, and passing over a certain steep Trench, left there so many Carkasses of their Enemies, that they levelled the inequality of the ground with heaps of dead bodies. Thus for a while sometimes the <hi>English</hi> and sometimes the <hi>Normans</hi> prevailed, neither side having much the better, so long as King <hi>Harold</hi> continued alive; but when at last he fell by an Arrow shot into his Brains, the <hi>English</hi> presently fled, till night parted them: Insomuch that the Valour of both Generals was very remarkable; for <hi>Harold</hi> was not contented only with perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the office of a General, but he did also act the part of a common Soldier, killing all those that came in his way, that none could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him without great hazard of being slain, till such time as that Unfortunate Shot above-mentioned put an end to his Life; and a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier afterwards giving his dead Body a Wound in the Thigh, he was for that base cowardly Action discarded by Duke <hi>William,</hi> who never ceased encouraging his Men both by his Voice and Presence, marching foremost against the thickest Ranks; so that whilst he thus shewed his

               <p>Thus he continued till the Night coming on left him at last entirely Victorious; and without doubt the Divine Hand did that day protect him, for he was not so much as wounded, though aimed at by so many Darts and Arrows.</p>
               <p>This is the Account which <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> gives us of this Fight; to which there needs little to be added out of other Authors, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of them writing from him, and only repeating his Relation in other words. But I cannot omit taking notice of some Passages which <hi>Radulph de Diceto</hi> gives us of this Battel; <hi>viz.</hi> That it was fought upon a <hi>Saturday,</hi> (being St. <hi>Calixtus</hi>'s day) the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of the <hi>Ides,</hi> that is, the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi>; That the <hi>English</hi> being drawn up in a narrow place, many of them withdrew themselves from the Battel, as having not room to fight, so that but few remained with the King: That Duke <hi>William</hi> marched against the Enemy in the Head of Five Regiments of Horse, which being all drawn up, a certain <hi>Norman</hi> called <hi>Tailefer</hi> came forth before both Armies, and there brandished his Sword in the face of the <hi>English,</hi> and whilst they stood gazing at him, he slew an <hi>English</hi> Ensign, who (it seems) came out to fight with him, and did the like to another who engaged him, but in the third Encounter with a fresh man was slain himself.</p>
               <p>Then began the Fight with a thick Shower of Arrows on the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s side, which Duke <hi>William</hi> commanded them not to shoot directly at the Enemy, but rather upward, that so they might fall upon the Heads of the <hi>English</hi>; which Stratagem proved fatal to them; for by one of these Arrows King <hi>Harold</hi> himself was slain: There were about twenty Valiant <hi>Norman</hi> Horsemen, who had engaged to each other, that breaking the <hi>English</hi> Army, they would seize upon the King's Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard; in compassing which, tho many of them perished, yet the rest pressing on with their Swords, at last carried it off. This Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, after the Victory, Duke <hi>William</hi> sent to the Pope, wherein the Figure of an Armed Combatant was curiously embroidered with Gold and Precious Stones.</p>
               <p>But concerning the Battel, a Manuscript Chronicle called <hi>Brutus,</hi> in the Archbishop's Library at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> farther relates, That Earl <hi>William</hi> (for so he stiles him) having made a fresh Assault upon the <hi>English</hi> with a Detachment of about a Thousand Horse, tried once more to break their Ranks, which not succeeding, the Earl immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that feign'd Retreat above-mention'd; by which the Order of the Main Body of the <hi>English</hi> being broken, the <hi>Normans</hi> thereupon rallying again, presently charged through the <hi>English</hi> Army, and gave them an entire Defeat.</p>
               <p>Some Writers also mention, That the <hi>Normans</hi> in their feigned Flight fell into a deep Trench which the <hi>English</hi> had made and covered over on purpose; tho this seems not at all likely; for how could they tell that they should put the <hi>Normans</hi> to flight, and make them fall into that Trench? But Mr. <hi>Holingshed</hi> from a Manuscript Chronicle of <hi>Battle-Abby,</hi> which he had seen, gives us a much more probable account of this Circumstance; <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Normans</hi> too earnestly pursuing the Chase
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93814:317"/>
when the <hi>English</hi> began to retreat,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLXVI.</note> many of the <hi>Norman</hi> Horse fell by chance into a certain deep Ditch, overgrown with Reeds, where most of them being pressed to death or stifled, perished.</p>
               <p>This is the best Account I can give you of this Great and Decisive Battel, which yet is very imperfect, since no Historians that I know of either <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Normans,</hi> have given us the Number of the Armies on both sides, or how many were slain; perhaps, because both had a mind to conceal what they thought did not make for their Credit: Only it is acknowledged on all hands, that they were so many on the <hi>Normans</hi> side as well as the <hi>English,</hi> that nothing but the over-ruling Providence of God by the Death of their King, could have given it away from them to their Enemies.</p>
               <p>In this Battel King <hi>Harold</hi> and his two Brothers, <hi>Gyrth</hi> and <hi>Leofwin,</hi> with most of the <hi>English</hi> Nobility, were slain; and an Ancient Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script in the <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Julius, D.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library farther relates, That the King's Body was hard to be certainly known by reason of its being so much disfigured by Wounds, yet was at last discovered by one who had been formerly his Mistress, and that by the means of certain private Marks known only to her self; and being taken up and wash'd by two of the Chanons of <hi>Waltham</hi> (which Monastery he had founded) was ordered by Duke <hi>William</hi> to be delivered to his Mother, and that without any Ransom, though she would have given a considerable Sum for it; but it was not long after buried in the Abby-Church of <hi>Waltham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet notwithstanding, <hi>Henry de Knyghton</hi> from <hi>Giraldus Cambrensis,</hi> gives a quite different account what became of this Prince; for he says that he was not slain in this Battel, but retiring privately out of it, lived and died an Anchoret in a Cell near St. <hi>John</hi>'s Church in <hi>Chester,</hi> as was owned by himself at his last Confession, when he lay a dying; and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that in memory thereof they shewed his Tomb when that Author wrote. But the concurrent Testimony of so many <hi>English</hi> Writers concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his being slain, and buried at <hi>Waltham,</hi> is certainly to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one single Evidence; not but that it might be true, that somebody might thus personate <hi>Harold,</hi> and have his Tomb afterwards shewn as his.</p>
               <p>But where or however he died, he was certainly a Prince of a Noble Presence, and of as Great a Mind; and had he not by a preposterous Ambition of gaining a Kingdom to which he had no Right, as well as by a Notorious Violation of his Solemn Oath, given Duke <hi>William</hi> a just Occasion of making War upon him, wherein he not only lost his own Life, but also was the occasion of the Ruin of so many of his Countreymen, he might have had as great a Character in History, as any Prince of his time.</p>
               <p>He had two Wives, the first he buried long before he was King; but none of our Writers mention her Name. His second was <hi>Algithe,</hi> Widow of <hi>Griffyth ap Lhewelyn,</hi> King of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> Sister of <hi>Edwi</hi> and <hi>Morchar,</hi> Earls of <hi>Yorkshire</hi> and <hi>Chester.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the former it is recorded that he had Children then of such an Age, that they waged War against K. <hi>William</hi> in the second year of his Reign.</p>
               <p>The first was <hi>Godwin,</hi> who with his Brother <hi>Edmund</hi> after his Father's Death and Overthrow, fled into <hi>Ireland</hi>; but returning again into <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> slew <hi>Ednoth</hi> (one of his Father's Ealdormen) who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter'd him, and then making great spoil in <hi>Devonshire</hi> and <hi>Cornwal,</hi> departed. The next year fighting with <hi>Beorne</hi> an Ealdorman of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal,</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:93814:317" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he afterwards returned into <hi>Ireland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLXVI.</note> and from thence went to <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> to King <hi>Sweyn,</hi> where he continued the Residue of his Life.</p>
               <p>The second was <hi>Edmund,</hi> who engaged with him in all his abovesaid Brother's Invasions and Wars, depending absolutely upon him whilst he lived and died (as he did) in <hi>Denmark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Magnus</hi> his third Son went with his two Brothers into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and came back with them the first time into <hi>England</hi>; but we find nothing of him after this, unless he was that <hi>Magnus</hi> who afterwards became an Anchoret.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wolfe</hi> his fourth Son seems to be born of Queen <hi>Algithe,</hi> and probably at King <hi>William</hi>'s Entrance here, he was but an Infant; yet after his Death he is named among his Prisoners; but by <hi>William Rufus</hi> was released, and by him honoured with the Order of Knighthood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gunhilde,</hi> a Daughter of <hi>Harold</hi>'s, is mentioned by <hi>John Capgrave</hi> in the Life of <hi>Wolstan</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and that she was a Nun, but where, is not mentioned; and being in most mens opinion's wholly blind, this <hi>Wolstan</hi> (if you will believe it from <hi>Capgrave)</hi> by a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle restor'd her absolutely to her Eyesight.</p>
               <p>Another Daughter of <hi>Harold</hi>'s is mentioned by <hi>Saxo Grammaticus,</hi> in his <hi>Danish</hi> History, to have been well received by her Kinsman King <hi>Sweyn</hi> the younger, and afterwards married to <hi>Waldemar</hi> King of the <hi>Russians,</hi> and to have had a Daughter by him, who was the Mother of <hi>Waldemar</hi> the first King of <hi>Denmark</hi> of that Name, from whom all the <hi>Danish</hi> Kings for many Ages after succeeded. This Account I have borrowed from Mr. <hi>Speed,</hi> who is very exact in the Pedigrees of our <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Kings.</p>
               <p>We find no Laws made in this King's time, only this, mentioned by <hi>Ingulph, viz.</hi> That King <hi>Harold</hi> made a Law, that whatever <hi>Welshman</hi> were found without leave on this side <hi>Offa</hi>'s Ditch, he should have his Right-hand cut off by the King's Officers: Which Law, I suppose, was made to restrain the pilfering Incursions of the <hi>Welsh,</hi> who were wont to come in small Companies into the <hi>English</hi> Borders, to rob, and carry away Cattel.</p>
               <p>But as for the Earls, <hi>Syward</hi> of <hi>Mercia,</hi> and <hi>Morchar</hi> of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Brothers, it is said they withdrew themselves out of the Battel, with their Followers, almost as soon as it began, either because they liked not the streightness of the Place where they were drawn up, or else were discontented with the King's Conduct; so marching immediately up to <hi>London,</hi> they there met with <hi>Aldred</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Edgar Atheling,</hi> with divers other Noblemen and Bishops, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted whom they should make King; divers of them were for <hi>Edgar Atheling,</hi> as the only remaining Branch of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Blood-Royal, under whom they resolved to renew the War; but he being young and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced, and the Major Part of the Bishops being against it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was done. <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> relates, That the two Earls above-mentioned solicited the <hi>Londoners</hi> to make one of them King, which when they found they could not prevail upon them so to do, taking their Sister, the Widow of King <hi>Harold</hi> along with them, and leaving her for security at <hi>Chester,</hi> they retired into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that Duke <hi>William</hi> would never march so far that Winter.</p>
               <p>But how much they were mistaken, and how they were forced to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselves to him, when the City of <hi>London</hi> and all the rest of the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93814:318" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Kingdom had acknowledg'd him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> MLXVI.</note> must be reserved for the next Volume.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Nobility and Clergy being thus divided in their sentiments, all their designs came to nothing: Thus (as the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor well observes) that as the <hi>English,</hi> if they had been all of one mind, might have prevented the Ruin of their Countrey; so since they could not agree to have one of their own Nation to reign over them, they were thereby brought under the subjection of Strangers.</p>
               <p>Indeed <hi>Guilel. Gemeticensis</hi> and <hi>Ordoricus Vitalis</hi> relate, That the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen and Bishops who had retired to <hi>London,</hi> actually chose <hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> King; but this seems not at all probable, since none of our own Writers mention it; and had <hi>Edgar</hi> been once elected, it is not likely that King <hi>William</hi> would have been so easily reconciled to him, and have not only given him his Liberty, but preferred him.</p>
               <p>Having from our <hi>Historians</hi> of best Credit given you this Account of our <hi>English</hi> Monarchs, most of whom mixing Piety with Civil Prudence reigned gloriously for many Generations, it will not be amiss for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, to let the Reader see how, not long before this sad Catastrophe, all sorts and degrees of men were now much degenerated from the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and Sobriety of their Ancestors: And first, as for the state of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in this Island, for some Ages before the coming in of the <hi>Normans, William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> observes, that Piety and all good Literature were commonly grown so much out of fashion even amongst the Clergy, that resting content with a very small share of Devotion as well as Learning, they could scarce read Divine Service; nay, the very Monks were clad in fine Stuffs, and made no difference of Days and Meat; which tho per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps no fault in it self, yet to them who were under other Principles, it was certainly much otherwise.</p>
               <p>Also, that the Great Men being given up to Gluttony and a dissolute Life, oppressed and made a Prey of the Common People, debauching their Daughters whom they had in their Service, and then turning them off to the Stews.</p>
               <p>Whilst the meaner sort sat tipling night and day, and spent all they had in Rioting and Drunkenness, and those attended with other Vices which effeminate men's minds: Therefore it came to pass through the just Judgment of God, that King <hi>Harold</hi> and those of his Party being carried away with Rashness and Fury, rather than any True Valour or Military Experience, gave Duke <hi>William</hi> this great Advantage over them, as hath been but now set forth. Not (says he) but that some few of the Clergy as well as Laity were much better; yet for the most part they were, as hath been here described.</p>
               <p>But as the long-suffering of God often permits the Bad as well as the Good to enjoy the like Prosperity; so likewise his Justice in punishing oft-times does not exempt even Good Men from partaking in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Calamities of their Countrey. Therefore I shall conclude this Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume with the like Admonition as Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> does his <hi>Saxon</hi> History; viz. <hi>That if these were (in all probability) the Causes of God's heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on our Ancestors, surely every man ought in this corrupt Age to take care to avoid them, lest in the height of a seeming Security, their long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in a course of Vice and Luxury should without a speedy Amendment meet with as severe, if not much worse Punishment.</hi>
