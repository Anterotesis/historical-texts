            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This I tooke to heart, but every way unable to remedy it, I rested silent, untill of late it came into my mind; That that part of the History of great <hi>Britaine,</hi> which was most intricate and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, which was the beginning of that Story was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily begun, and as ingeniously followed (by that every way well) deserving Gentleman <hi>Samuel Daniel:</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all those rubbes and blancks, which the deluge of time, had raised and left on the plat-forme, were made smooth or taken away, and that Vicount Saint <hi>Albones</hi> had so sufficiently perfected, that of all other the most doubtfull (if not dangerous peece) of Pater times to bee undertaken, the happy Conjunction of the so long seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Houses of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and that many others, reverend and judicious men, had by way of Annuals pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued the History unto the blessed Vniting of the two

neighbour, but long before divided Kingdomes, of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> so that now there wanted nothing to make the History compleat, for so much as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite untill that time, but only the passages from <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the second, to the period of <hi>Richard</hi> the third, a great part whereof was-likewise accurately done, by Sir <hi>Iohn Heywood</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> so that now with little la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that gap might easily be filled up, and the History made; Whereupon I have adventured to adde my peece of ordinary valure, to those rich remnants of three pild Velvet, by enterviewing the times of <hi>Richard</hi> the second, <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, <hi>Henry</hi> the fift, <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt; <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, <hi>Edward</hi> the fift, and the Vsurper <hi>Richard</hi> the third, <hi>Wherein though I prove but a botcher, yet as the old saying is, better a course clout then a hole out.</hi> And to cleere my selfe though not <hi>à toto,</hi> yet <hi>à tanto,</hi> from that aspersion that happily might bee cast upon my endevours, that howsoever not ignorant of my owne manifold imperfections, yet like blind bayard, I should over-boldly venture, to tread in that Maze, which ought not to have beene underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but by a more able body, and a more active braine, and thereby have forgetfully brought my selfe within the number of those over-forward Writers, which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Heywood</hi> in his Epistle Dedicatorie to his first three Norman Kings affirmeth, hath sullied the beautie of the English History.</p>
            <p>Give mee leave gentle Reader, (I beseech thee) as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have yeelded the reason, that incited mee to the undertaking of this worke, so to give thee an account of my proceeding therein.</p>
            <p>First, I have forborne to assume unto my selfe the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of an Historian, to obtrude upon thee any thing of my owne invention, <hi>quia malui aliena imprudenter dicere quàm propria impudenter ingerere:</hi> And for that History is or ought to bee <hi>a perfect register of things formerly done truely:</hi> ot at least warrantable by probabilitie, I have <hi>pro posse meo</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:7754:4"/>
examined, though not all, (yet without touch of <hi>Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance,</hi> I may speake it) the most and best, that have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of those times, and culling out the truth as neere as I could gather it, like an Eccho, <hi>Voces quas accepi fidelissimè reddidi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I have pared off these superfluous exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, which like Wennes upon a beautifull face, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the otherwise gracefull comlinesse of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, I meane,</p>

            <p n="3">3.

            <p>And lastly, I have inserted the matches and issue, of all above the degree of a Baron, that have ended their dayes during those times, with the number of slaine, during the division of the two Roses, which how farre it may conduce to the better understanding of the History, I leave to thy capacitie, and my selfe to thy courtesie, and expecting a favourable censure rest thine;</p>

But <hi>Philpot</hi> with a kinde of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted resolution, not only justified the act, as though not altogether lawfull yet very expedient being done for the honour of God, and the King, and the security of the republicke, but retorted the objection of improvidence and slothfull neglect, upon the Earle and the rest of the Councell, so that they were much to seeke for a reply, and hee returned with the generall applause of the Citizens, and most of the Courtiers.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> presuming of the Kings minoritie, with some Spanish <note place="margin">Anno. Dom. 1376.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7754:6"/>
which presently was besieged and assaulted, and (though valiantly defended, <note place="margin">An. 1380. R. 2.</note> was with some losse at length surprised, upon the taking whereof not one man but the Captaine <hi>Ramsey</hi> was spared.</p>
            <p>In the third yeare of this Kings raigne it was concluded that to avoide <note place="margin">Anno 1381. R. 3.</note> unnecessary charge, the tutelage of the King, should bee committed but to one man; and by the whole consent of the Parliament dissembled, this office was deputed to Lord <hi>Thomas Beuchampe</hi> Earle of Warwicke, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent <note place="margin">The Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> made sole Tutour to the King.</note> pension was assigned him, out of the Kings Exchequer, for his paines and care thereabouts to be taken. But the King being plunged in the gulfe of pleasure, did immoderately bend himselfe, to advance and favour such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as were reprovable for life, and generally condemned for deboshment, and this was the cause of two great inconveniences, for many of the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Nobilitie, observing the secret favours and distastes of the King: gave over themselves to a dissolute and dishonest course, which findeth some followers, when it hath no furtherancers, much more when it doth flourish and thrive by countenance and abetement: The King also by favouring these, was himselfe little favoured, and lesse loved by many; For it is as dangerous to a Prince, to have evill and despised adherents, as to be evill and despicable himselfe; The chiefe actors in this scene were <hi>Nevill</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Yorke, Robert Uear</hi> Earle of <hi>Oxford, Michael Delapoole, Robert Tressilian</hi> Lord chiefe Iustice, <hi>Nicholas Bramber</hi> Alderman of <hi>London,</hi> and others neither eminent by birth or desert, but observant and plyable to the Kings humour: These were highly in credit with the King, both in company and counsell al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes next him; By these hee ordered his private actions, by these he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged his affaires of State, hee spared neither the dignity, nor death of any man, whose authority or life, interposed their pleasure or profit. Hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued Sir <hi>Richard Scroope</hi> from being Lord Chancelor of <hi>England</hi> (to <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Scroop</hi> Lord Chancellor removed.</note> which place hee was appointed by the Parliament,) because hee refused to set the great Seale to the grant of certaine lands, which had beene abusively drawne from the King: alledging for his so doing the great debts of the King, the small demerits of the graunts, upon whom the King might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume much, but orderly give nothing; wishing the King might bee well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised thatryot might deceive him under the termes of bounty, and that gifts well ordered procure not so much love, as indiscreetly imparted incite envie: This Chancellor used not to cauterize his conscience, with partiall maintaining of such as were mighty, but being alike to all, was the sooner disliked of all that were lewd: The destruction of the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> was plotted upon the like dislike, by Iustice <hi>Tresilian,</hi> offences were sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, appellors appointed, Peeres named, sudden arrest intended, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent arraignment, condemnation, and execution concluded; But the Duke upon notice of these contrivances, escaped to <hi>Pomfret</hi> Castle, and there made preparation for his defence against the King, from hence grew a head of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, which the common people at that time very busily sought. But the Kings Mother incessantly travailing betweene the King and the Duke, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding her unweldinesse and age) drew them both to reconcilement; The King in regard of the dangerous and discontented times, the Duke in respect of his dutie and alleageance, the more easie to bee made inclinable and so partly by her entreatie and counsell, and partly by their inclination bending to the safest course, all apparance of displeasure on the one part, and, distrust on the other, was for that time removed. The Frenchmen againe, land in <hi>England</hi> and did much harme, at <hi>Dover, Winchelsey, Hastings,</hi> and at <hi>Graves end,</hi> and unincountred returned to <hi>France;</hi> For prevention of which

               <hi>Westminster,</hi> in which a Subsidie of foure pence for poll of each sexe throughout the kingdome, (above the age of fourteene yeares) is granted to the King; The levying whereof procured much heart-burning, and did much alyen the hearts of the subjects from the King; With that money pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is made, and eight thousand men sent over into <hi>France,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Woodstocke</hi> the Kings Vncle, who passing over <hi>Soam, Oyse,</hi> and <hi>Marne, Rivers,</hi> spoyled and burnt all the Countrey, and ransomed the Inhabitants untill hee came to <hi>Brittany,</hi> where by the Duke <hi>Iohn Mom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> hee was joyfully received, and royally entertained.</p>
            <p>About this time one <hi>Iohn Balle</hi> a factious clergy man, a scholler of <hi>Wickcliff,</hi> observing the common people much to murmure at the payment of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Subsidie, in all places where hee came used secretly to informe the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour sort of people, such as were poore and needy, That by discent from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> all men were of one condition, that the lawes of this kingdome were injurious, and much hindred us of participating Christian liberty, nay most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just by making so great a difference of mens estate, preferring some to bee Peeres and Potentates, giving to some others large authority, and enlarging others possessions, and taking advantage of the humble and plyable condition, and carriage of others in servilitie and basenesse, hardly giving them allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of sustenance, and that not that neither, but with sweat, and hard labour, where amongst Christians there should be an equall share of all things, and that in common, taking this for his theame; <hi>When</hi> Adam <hi>delv'd and</hi> Eve <hi>span, who was then a gentleman</hi> with such like trayterous perswasions hee did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the vulgar (apt to entertaine the proffers of rebellion) and fitte them for insurrection upon the slightest occasion; This doctrine once on foot runne from rusticke to villanie, and from shire to shire, that at length it infatuated them, and infected the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> the Commons whereof, I meane the poorer sort of mechanicks and handicrafts, desperately inclined to mutinie upon the reasons aforesaid incited and invited the multitude prepared as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid to come thither, promising their best assistance and furtherance; Whereupon a rude rowte of rascalls, under the leading of <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> a Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor who commanded in chiefe, with their grave minister, <hi>Iohn Wall: Iacke Straw,</hi> a Thresher, <hi>Iack Sheppard</hi> of the Councell of warre, under the tytle of the Kings men, and the servants of the Common-wealth of <hi>England,</hi> came to <hi>London,</hi> ransacking by the way, and demolishing from <hi>Essex</hi> side all the faire structures and great buildings, of the Nobility and Gentry; They summoned the King to give them a meeting; who accordingly accompanied, with the most of his best Councellours, tooke-his Bardge and went to <hi>Graves End;</hi> but seeing the rabble so ragged and rogue-like, a company of swadds compact of the off-skum of the people, it was held no discretion for the King to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his person among them, and so returned to the Tower from whence hee came.</p>
            <p>The next day these unruly rake-shames approched <hi>London,</hi> but finding the gates lockt, and the bridge drawne, and well guarded, they threatned the <note place="margin">Ann.

and revenewes of the Crowne; 2. For profusely wasting the treasure in ryotous prodigalitie, and unnecessary expences; 3. For being dived deepe <note place="margin">An. 1384. R. 6.</note> into the Kings debt; 4: For being carelesse and corrupt in his Office; 5. For deceiving and discrediting the King in his accounts and disbursement (the particulars whereof were annext to the Bill) with divers objections of, both dishonesty of body, and dishonour in his private actions, and publike Office. This Earle from <hi>London</hi> sent a student to <hi>Oxford,</hi> returned, well clothed to the Court, and there suddenly growne great, could not moderate his change, but in his height of prosperitie, layed open the basenesse of his inclination and condition, which before were either cunningly covered, or craftily clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, from being discovered; And serving a weake Ruler, in an eminent place, with an ill minde, hee made open sale of his Princes honour; But the King willing to connive at, or remit the offences, silently let the complaints slip, with a short audience and no examination, expressing himselfe thereby neither much grieved at the offences, nor well pleased with the complaint: A Subsidie is required, but answer was made, there was no need of it, since <note place="margin">A subsidy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and denyed.</note> the Kings wants might bee furnished and supplyed, with his owne debts due from the Chancellour if called in, neither was it if otherwise, to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to bee graunted so long as the moneys should bee issued by such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as formerly had beene, and was likely to bee againe.</p>
            <p>The complaints against the Chancellour are recontinued with that earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that the King is perswaded, that it is neither for his Honour, or safetie, to justifie him, for to private men it is sufficient, if themselves abstaine from wrong, but Princes must provide that none doe wrong under them; For by conniving and abetting the faults of their Officers, they make them too often seeme their owne: and they will bee objected against them upon the first occasion; The importunitie of both houses, wrought the Kings consent to a Commission, to authorize divers noble men, to heare and determine all grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and objections against the Chancellour; Thereupon a Subsidie is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but with proviso, that the money bee disposed of by the Commissioners agreed upon to the benefit of the Realme.</p>
            <p>The King moved that the heires of <hi>Charles Bloyes,</hi> who laid clayme to the Dutchy of <hi>Britaine,</hi> should be delivered to the French upon the receipt of 30000. Markes by them to that purpose offered, the same to bee delivered to the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the recovery of those possessions the King had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was assented unto, so as before the feast of Easter following the Duke should depart thither, and there remaine; at so high a <note place="margin">Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to receive the Susibdie.</note> rate they valued his riddance out of the Realme; The charge of the Subsidie was committed to <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of <hi>Arundle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> and the said Earle, were made Commissioners concerning the Earle of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> who by the Kings absence is left to himselfe, to answer the objected misdemeanours, whereof hee made the Kings blind favour his priviledge and protection, presuming never to see that either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered or over-ruled: Hee is convict of many crimes, deposed from his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, his goods are confiscate to the King, and himselfe adjudged to execution, which was submitted to the Kings pleasure, and under sureties was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to goe at large.</p>

            <p>This businesse blowne over: the King returnes to <hi>London,</hi> and presently receives the Earle of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Archbishop of <hi>Yorke</hi> ro greater grace and familiaritie then before; These Triumvirs incence the King agalnst the Nobles, that wore best deserving, partly upon disgraces desertfully done unto them; partly upon malitious emulation, to see others so generally beloved (except of the King) and themselves so contemptible; And that their private spleene might carry some shew of publike respect, they suggested to the King, hee was but halfe, yea not halfe a King; For (sayd they) if wee respect matters of State, you beare the sword, but they sway it, you have the show, but they the authority of a Prince, using your name as a colourable pretext to their proceedings, and your Person as a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher to make their number the greater by the addition thereof, without which they could be nothing, neither are you any thing more by being so pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; Looke you to the duties of your Subjects, and you shall finde it is at their devotion, for you cannot command nor demand, but with such limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and exceptions as they please to propose; And for your privat actions, your bounty (the most to bee observed good vertue in a Prince,) is restray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, your expences measured, and your affections confined, to frowne, and favour, as they shall please to prescribe you? what Ward is so much under government of his Guardian? Wherein will they, or can they, more abridge you? Except they should take from you the place, as they have done the power of a Prince; And in this we thinke they may justly bee feared, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so great might, and meanes, to give wings to ambitious mindes; Power is never safe when it doth exceed: Ambition is like the Crocodile, growing as long as it liveth; or like the Ivie, which rising at the foot will overpeere the highest wall, it is already growne from at sparke, to a flame, and more then time it is such increase, were stayed; For such over-ruling Princes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage their overthrowing, and such cutting them short, hath turned to cutting them off, their mindes are suspitious, their power dangerous, and therefore the opportunitie must warily be prevented. The Kings youth and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, made him apprehensive, and framed his minde to a full but needlesse feare, hee was much moved with the removall of his Chancellor, and Treasurer out of their offices, and the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> out of the Realme, supposing it a restraint to his regall authoritie, not to have absolute power in all things, to give and forgive at his pleasure; when these privy incensers perceived, the Kings honour once sharpned, they so plyed him with plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perswasions, that (though naturally hee was of no cruell disposition, yet they drew him to many violent, and indirect courses) partly upon negligence to search out the truth, partly upon delight to bee flattered, neither did they long deferre their stratagems; At first it was plotted, that the Duke of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> and certaine others of that part, should bee invited to supper in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and there made away, Sir <hi>Nicholas Brember,</hi> who had beene late Maior of the Citie, whose abundance of wealth supplied the want of honest qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in him, was a busie agent in that butcherly businesse; But <hi>Richard Exon</hi> then Maior, discovered the plot, and thereof warned the Duke, to avoid the present perill, and afterwards to bee wary of the like.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of <hi>Arundle,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> commanded at Sea the Kings fleet, and tooke an hundred sayle of the enemies shippes <note place="margin">Anno.

The Earles in this service for their valour and curtesie, got great
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7754:10"/>
reputation; and their actions did by so much appeare, the more honorary, by how much, the infortunate insufficiency of other Generalls before, by whose <note place="margin">An. 1387. R. 9.</note> either rashnesse, or cowardise, or both, many souldiers had beene defeated, and every yeare had beene famous before for one losse or other. At their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, (the King more inclinable to revenge displeasure, then reward desert, for it is troublesome to bee gratefull, but revenge is pleasant, and preferred before gaine) entertained them with strangenesse of speech, and by his countenance seemed, hee was ill pleased, for that they had deserved so well.</p>
            <p>About this time the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> repudiated his wife, whose mother <hi>(Isabel)</hi> was daughter to <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and tooke in her place a Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners daughter a <hi>Bohemian;</hi> The King little regarded this indignitie done unto his Cousin german, (though by her often petitioned for redresse.) And in this so great confusion of State, let it passe unreproved, as obscured with greater vices; But <hi>Gloucester</hi> her Vncle tooke it in disdaine, as an indignitie offered to the blood royall, and intended revenge, and so much did intimate to the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who plotted under hand, the destruction of <hi>Gloucester;</hi> the one openly and manlike persecuted his enmitie: but the other cowardly and covertly, and therefore the more dangerously; <hi>Gloucester</hi> was neerer and greater in blood, <hi>Ireland,</hi> in favour, this being uncle to the King: that bearing himselfe as the Kings fellow; The one pretended all hee did for the honour of the State, the other for humour of the King, much malice did passe, but in opposition of such equall powers, there is seldome small diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in harmes.</p>
            <p>The terme assigned the Duke <hi>Uear</hi> for his departure into <hi>Ireland</hi> is past, and lest his stay might breed some stirre in <hi>England,</hi> hee still shewed himselfe busie, for preparing for his journey, and at last (though long first,) made a <note place="margin">The King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Wales.</hi>
               </note> show of setting forth; The King went in great state to accompany him to ship; and the Earle of <hi>Suffolke</hi> with Iustice <hi>Tresilian</hi> and the rest of that side either for favour followed, or for feare durst not stay behind; Together they went to <hi>Wales,</hi> and there the Dukes Irish journey was finished; There they debate in Councell, how the Lords might best bee suppressed, many plots were invented, all that were worst pleased well, without respect of danger or disgrace, but few stood without likelihood of event to their desires, and therfore none was fully concluded on; At length they leave <hi>Wales</hi> and come to <hi>Nottingham</hi> Castle, where the high Sheriffes of every County are sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to appeare, and strictly interrogated, with strength if need should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>require, they were able to backe the King with against the Lords, the King was generally answered; that the Commons did so favour the Lords, and were so well resolved of their dutifull love, and loyaltie to their Soveraigne, that they durst make promise of no power to bee raysed against them. Then they were commanded to elect no Knights, Citizens, or Burgesses for the Parliament, but only such as the King should approve, whereto they sayd it was an hard matter in times of suspect, to robbe the people of their antient priviledge, for choosing Knights and Burgesses for the Parliament, and after some few other matters which were either unseasonably moved, or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably obtained, to small purpose, the Sheriffs were licenced to depart; Then were assembled <hi>Tressilian</hi> chiefe Iustice of the Kings bench, <hi>Belknapp</hi> chiefe Iustice of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon pleace, <hi>Holt, Stil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p n="1">1. Whether the Statute, Ordinance, and Commission (meaning that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7754:10"/>
granted against the Duke of <hi>Suffolke)</hi> set out the last Parliament, did dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the royall prerogative of the King.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How they were to bee punished, that did procure that Statute to bee inacted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How they were to bee dealt with, that provoked the King to consent thereto.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What punishment did they deserve that compelled the King to yeeld consent.</p>
            <p n="5">5. What did they merit that resisted the King to exercise his regall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, in remitting or releasing, any penalties or debts due to him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When a Parliament is assembled, and the affaires of the State, and cause of convoking the Parliament declared, and Articles limited by the King; upon which only, the Lords and Commons should meddle; the Lords and Commons will proceed upon other, and not those by the King appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, untill the King hath given answer to the other by them propounded, whether in this case the King ought to have the rule of the Parliament, and so to order the fact, that the Lords and Commons upon the Articles limited by the King; or that they should first have answer of the King to the Articles by them propounded before they proceed any further?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Whether may the King at his pleasure dissolve the Parliament, and command the Lords and Commons to depart?</p>
            <p n="8">8. Since the King may at his pleasure remove any Officers and Iustices, and punish them for their offences, whether may the Lords and Commons, without his leave, accuse his Officers and Iustices in Parliament yea or no?</p>
            <p n="9">9. What punishment have they deserved, who moved a Parliament, that the statute whereby King <hi>Edward Carnarvon</hi> was deposed should be brought forth, by view whereof the last Statute and Commission aforesaid were framed?</p>
            <p n="10">10. Whether the judgement given in the last Parliament against <hi>Michael de la Poole</hi> Earle of <hi>Suffolke</hi> were erroneous and revocable yea or no?</p>
            <p>These propositions which were drawne by the direction of the chiefe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice <hi>Tresilian,</hi> to which the afornamed Iustices answer as followeth;</p>
            <p n="1">1. They did derogate from the Honour of the King, because extorted against his will.</p>
            <p n="2,3">2. 3. That they deserved to bee punished by death, except the King in mercy would remit.</p>
            <p n="4,5">4. 5. Worthy to bee punished as Traytours.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Whosoever resisteth the Kings rule in that point, was punishable as a Traytour.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That the King may at his pleasure dissolve the Parliament, and who so afterwards shall presume to proceed against the Kings manifest will, as in a Parliament is worthy the punishment of a Traytor.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That they cannot; whosoever doth the contrary deserveth a Traytors punishment.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Aswell the mover as the bringer of that Statute to the house, are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the same death.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And lastly, that the said judgement seemed erronious and revocable. In witnesse whereof they with <hi>Iohn Lockton</hi> the Kings Sergeant at Law sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, and so under their Seales at armes sent it.</p>
            <p>When those hard sentences of death, and treason, were under generall and large termes, thus fastened upon the Lords, the King supposed his attempts against them, whether by violence, or colour of Law, sufficiently warranted,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7754:11"/>
but his power both wayes, (as it was terrible against weake resisters, so against such mighty defendants, was of small force to effect that, which he so much affected; yet hee did not omit his best endevours, and first accounting the Lords, as condemned persons, hee made division of their lands and goods amongst those he favoured: Then hee waged souldiers to bee in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse for his assistance, and sent the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> to arrest the Earle of <hi>Arundell,</hi> at his Castle in <hi>Rygate</hi> where hee then lay, but he either upon advertisement, or suspition of the Kings intent, bandied himselfe so strong, that when the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> came thither to him, hee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled his intent, and left his errand untold: The Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> having secret intelligence of the Kings displeasure, and of his projects sent the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <note place="margin">A good office of the Bishop of <hi>London.</hi>
               </note> of <hi>London</hi> to perswade the King to entertaine a more favourable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him, solemnly swearing unto the Bishop, that hee never intended any thing against the King, either in person or state; The Bishop not unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to joyne profitable perswasions with honesty; declared to the King, that the ground of his displeasure against the Lords, was either by false suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their enemies, or misconstruction of some of their actions by himselfe: Then declared hee how desirous they were of his grace and favour, how faithfull and forward they promised to persist in all dutifull service, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intimated how honourable this agreement would bee to the King, and how profitable to the kingdome, nay which was above both, how pleasing it would bee to God, and how displeasing to him, and dangerous it would be to both sides, if these troubles should increase. The King by this speech see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med inclinable to attonement; But <hi>Delapoole,</hi> a turbulent person, against quiet counsell: standing neere the King, quickly hardned his minde against all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of friendship, by meanes whereof contention arose betwixt the Bishop, and the Earle, which violently broke out into heate of words; The Earle reproched the Lords with the ordinary objection against great men (popularitie, and ambition:) sparing no spight of speech, but using all retho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke to aggravate matters against them; The Bishop replyed, the Earle was thus fiercely bent, not upon any necessity of his owne, or respect unto the King, but only to satisfie his bloody and ambitious humour, wherein he was so immoderate, that rather then the Lords should not be destroyed, he would overwhelme them with the ruines of the State; For tumults might bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed raysed by men of little courage, like himselfe, but must bee maintayned by hazard, and ended with the losse of the most violent, that neither his counsell against what was desired, in this cause was to bee followed, (being the principall firebrand of the disturbance) nor his complaints against any man, in any thing to bee regarded, being himselfe a condemned person, and one that held his life, and livelihood, of the Kings favourable mercy, wherewith the King was so exceedingly wroth, that hee commanded the Bishop out of his presence; The Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> hearing this, signifies the danger to the Earles of <hi>Arundel, Warwicke,</hi> and <hi>Darby,</hi> inciting them to armes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they confederate themselves, for a common defence: For in so doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and suspected peace, open warre (said they) was the better safety; The King having intelligence of their courses indevoured to prevent the Lords in joyning their forces; and to that end sent some power, either to set upon the Earle of <hi>Arundel</hi> in his lodging, or to intercept him in his passage to the Duke; But the Earle had marched all night, before their comming; and so unencountred came to the Duke, with whom hee found the Earles with a sufficient company, aswell to make an attempt, as to stand upon resistance: This much distracted the King; being now in choice either to relent or resist,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7754:11"/>
much disdayning the one, and distrusting the other, his followers also were divided in counsell, some fretting at the disgrace, others fainting at the danger. The Archbishop of <hi>Yorke</hi> perswaded with the King, that occasion was now offered, to shew himselfe a King indeed; If hee would rayse a royall army; and by maine might, beat downe the boldnesse of their presumption; This was more readily advised, then done, saith another. The adversaries army is mightie, the Commanders are great men, both for courage, and skill, and greatly favoured by the Commons, whereby that which is accounted so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy pay, may prove a desperate debt; Therefore it were better, with some show of yeelding, to enter into conditions of quiet, then by standing upon too nice punctilioes of Honor: to hazard the doubtfull event of battaile, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the King cannot joyne, but by his weakning; nor loose without danger of his undoing. There was present old Sir <hi>Hugh Linne,</hi> a good souldier, but a shuttle braine, of whom the King in merriment demanded in this case what was as hee thought fittest to bee done: Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> swore, blood and wounds, let us charge home, and kill every mothers sonne, and so wee shall make quicke dispatch of the best friends you have in the kingdome, this giddy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, more wayed with the King, then if it had beene spoken in grave and sober sort; And thus it often happeneth, that wise counsell is more sweetly followed, when it is tempered with folly, and earnest is the lesse offensive, if it bee delivered in jest; In the end the raysing of armes is layd aside, not as displeasing (being so agreeable to former proceeding) but as despayring to prevaile thereby; The Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> with the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> Lord Chancellor, were sent unto the Lords, to understand the cause of their assembly: Answer was made, that it was for the safety of themselves, the honour of the King, and the overthrow of those, that sought destruction of both: but by the mediation of the Bishop it was concluded, that the Lords should come before the King at <hi>Westminster</hi> upon caution of his protection: and there have publike audience, concerning their grievances. The Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> giving private promise, faithfully to discover any danger hee could descry, who accordingly, gave notice, (or little before the Lords appointed to come,) of an awaite, that was purposed for their entrapping; at the place called the Mewes neere <hi>London,</hi> advised them, either to make stay, or to come provided, but rather to make stay then to come forward, lest further provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, might make reconciliation more difficult: Whereupon, they came not at the time appointed; The King marvelling at their faylance, demanded of the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> the cause, who boldly answered, that the Lords found <note place="margin">The Bishops sent to the Barons.</note> want of true meaning; and that they neither did, nor durst, repose assurance in the Kings words, which they apparantly saw, was but a meanes to ensnare them. The King made the matter very strange unto him, protesting that hee was free from deceit both in consent and knowledge, and presently gave command to the Sheriffes of <hi>London,</hi> to goe to that place and to slay or take all such as they fonnd there in waite; whether this was but a countenance of his, or whether hee was not privie to the practice, it is not assuredly knowne, but the matter was not false, but the place mistaken; For Sir <hi>Thomas Tryvet,</hi> and Sir <hi>Nicholas Bramber,</hi> had assembled divers armed men at <hi>Westminster,</hi> to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault the Lords at their best advantage, but perceiving the discovery of their plot, they secretly dissolved their company, and sent them away.</p>
            <p>Then the Lords, upon new faith, for their securitie, came to the King to <hi>Westminster,</hi> but brought a guard with them, so many, as in a place where they were entirely favoured; was able to defend them from any sudden defeate. The King upon their comming, entred into <hi>Westminster</hi> great Hall: apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7754:12"/>
in his royall robes, and when hee was placed in his seate; and composed himselfe to majestie and state. The Lord Chancellor, made a large Oration <note place="margin">Ann. 1388 R. 10.</note> to the Lords, in the Kings name, wherein hee declared, the heynousnesse of their offence, and the greatnesse of their perill, how easie a matter it had been <note place="margin">The Lord Chancellors speech to the Lords.</note> for the King, to have levyed a power, sufficient to have destroyed them, and yet for the generall spare of his subjects blood, and in particular favour, to the Duke and other Nobles hee made choice, to encounter, and overcome them, rather by friendship, then by force, and therefore was willing, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pardon their ryot, but also to heare their griefe, and in a quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way to redresse them. The Lords alledged the cause of their taking armes, to be, first, the necessitie of their owne defence; secondly, their true love both to King, and Realme, whose fame and fortune did daily decline, by meanes of certaine traytours, who lived only by the dishonour of the one, and decay of the other, like mothes in bookes and garments, that thrive by others losse. Those whom they particularly challenged to bee Traytours, were <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Uear</hi> Duke of <hi>Ireland, Nevill</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Yorke, Delapoole</hi> Earle of <hi>Suffolke, Robert Tresilian,</hi> Lord chiefe Iustice, Sir <hi>Nicholas Bramber,</hi> with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain others more secret, but little better: And to justifie this their appeale, they threw downe their gloves, and offered themselves to the tryall of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat: The King replyed, that oftentimes the causes of action being good, yet if the meanes want moderation, and judgement, the ends prove pernitious; And therefore though these complaints should bee true, yet were these cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses not tolerable, which did beare an open face of rebellion, and by the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnesse of the multitude might soone have sorted to such a period, for it is more easie to raise the people then to rule them, whose fury being once stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, will commonly, bee discharged some wayes. But (saith hee) since we have broken this broyle; wee will not by combating, give occasion of new, but at our Parliament which I will instantly convoke, both you and they shall bee present, and Iustice indifferently done to all. In the meane time I take you all into my protection, that neither of you shall endanger or endamage other, wishing the Lords to remember that as Princes must rule without limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, so Christian subjects must use a meane in their liberty; Then he caused the Dukes and the Earles, which all this while kneeled, to arise and goe with him into his private chamber, where they talked together, and after with a most friendly farewell, hee licenced them to depart; They of the adverse part, were absent at this meeting, and if they had not, it might have beene feared, the Kings presence should have beene but a poore protection unto them. The Kings demeanour herein was divers wayes censured, some ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued him fearefull: others moderate and mercifull, in preventing the effusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his subjects blood. The Lords were well pleased with his good will and favour; which as by base and servile meanes, they would not seeke, being thus gotten, they did highly esteeme, yet they thought it the safest course, not to separate themselves, suspecting the mutabilitie of the King, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of their enemies, of whom, neither knew they where they were, nor what they did intend, and being persons of great wealth, and greater power, but most bent to hurtfull practises, they were feared not without cause; For the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> either by setting on, or sufferance of the King, was all this time, mustering of souldiers in Cheshire, or <hi>Wales,</hi> where hee gathered an army, both for number, and goodnesse of men sufficient, if another had beene Generall, to have carried a side; whereof the Lords advertised, they divided themselves, and beset the wayes, by which the Duke should passe to <hi>London,</hi> with an intent, to encounter him before hee did increase his power,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7754:12"/>
and countenance his action, with the name of the King; The Earle of <hi>Darby</hi> met him, at a place called <hi>Babbelake</hi> neere <hi>Burford,</hi> where the Earles soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, full of hearty courage, disliking nothing more then delay, thinking losse of time, was a procrastinating of the victory: came on bravely. But the Duke being mutinous but not fit for action, apter to stirre strife, then stint it, upon sight of their approach would have fled; But Sir <hi>Thomas Mollineux,</hi> an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved souldier Constable of <hi>Chester,</hi> upon whose leading all that countrey men did depend, perswaded the Duke that this was but a part of the forces, led only by the Earle of <hi>Darby</hi> a man no way eminent; and if they could not beare through that resistance, it was in vaine to expect any atchievement of honour by armes; Whereupon the Duke made stay, but his faint spirits were moved by this speech, rather to desire victory, then hope it, his souldiers also, were dull, silent, and sad; and such as were rather ready to interpret, then execute the Captaines command; They wind battaile, but scarce ten ounces of blood was lost on both sides, before the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> set spurres to his horse, and forsooke the field: his souldiers thereupon, more out of indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then feare, refused their rankes: yeelded to the Earle, the honour of the field; Sir <hi>Thomas Mullineux</hi> flying, was ouertaken and slaine by Sir <hi>Thomas Mortimer:</hi> the rest submitted themselves, to the discretion of the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; making them the Lords of their lives and death: yeelding was no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner offered, then excepted by the Earle, who commanded, that none should be reproched, or ill intreated, but the obstinate: which was obeyed, the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers willing to shew favour to their countrey-men, who were led into this action partly upon simplicitie, partly for company sake, The Gentlemen and those of the better sort, were retayned by the Earle, the rest unarmed were licenced at their pleasure to depart. The Duke in his flight, was enforced to take a river, and in the midst of the streame, forsooke his horse, and swam to the other side: and by the benefit of the night escaped, first into <hi>Scotland,</hi> then into <hi>Flaunders,</hi> and lastly into <hi>France,</hi> from whence hee never returned, his horse, with his helmet and gauntlets, with other abiliments of his were found, whereupon it was generally conceived, that hee was drowned, and as in great uncertainties it often hapneth, some affirmed they saw him dye, with the manner thereof, which other men, either glad to heare, or not too curious to search did easily beleeve: His Trunke also was taken with certaine letters of the Kings therein, the contents whereof were, for his present repaire to <hi>London,</hi> with all power, and speed hee could make, and the King would bee there ready, to dye in his defence, so unskilfull was the Kings government, that to pleasure a few, hee did not respect to give discontent to many. The Earle of <hi>Suffolke</hi> hereupon disguised, fled to <hi>Callice,</hi> from whence hee never returned, hee was a cruell spoiler, and a carelesse spender: in warre contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible: in peace insupportable, an enemy to all counsell of others, and in his owne conceit wondrously wise, obstinately contentious, of a quicke wit, and ready speech, both which hee abused, to the cunning commending of himselfe, and crafty depraving of others, he was lesse loved, but more heard of the King, then the Duke, the more hurtfull man, and the more hatefull; The Duke being indeed guilty, of no great fault, but the Kings excessive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, in their course of good, and bad fortune, both of them alike famous.</p>
            <p>This Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> was <hi>Robert de Vere</hi> the fourth of that name, and ninth Earle of <hi>Oxford,</hi> hee married <hi>Philip</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Ingeram de Guisnes</hi> by <hi>Isabel</hi> his wife, the Daughter of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, from whom he was divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and tooke to his second wife <hi>Lantegroine</hi> a Bohemian, of an unknowne parentage, but died without issue.</p>

This <hi>Michael de la Poole</hi> Earle of <hi>Suffolke</hi> married <hi>Isabel</hi> Daughter of Sir <hi>Iohn Wingfield,</hi> and had issue five sonnes, <hi>Thomas, William, Michael, Richard,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and three daughters, <hi>Margaret</hi> married to <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Ferrers</hi> of <hi>Groby, Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Anne.</hi>

            <p>The Archbishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> Iustice <hi>Tresilian,</hi> and others of that faction, ran every man like Conyes to their covert, yea the King betooke himselfe to the tower of <hi>London,</hi> and there made provision for his winter abode: having all his courses now crossed; first, by rashnesse in taking of armes, and afterward by cowardlinesse in maintaining them; The Earles of <hi>Darby,</hi> signified this successe to his associates by Letters: but without vaunting, his speeches also were moderate, rather extenuating then extolling his fact, but by stopping his fame it increased; men esteeming his high thoughts, by his humble words, and his consent of greater attempts by contempt of this. The Lords met and marched together to <hi>London,</hi> whither with forty thousand men they came upon Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> day, and first they shewd themselves in battaile array, in the fields within view of the King, then encamped in the Suburbs. The Maior of <hi>London</hi> and his brethren, came forth and offered, the Lords free entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment within the Citie, but not accepted. They give liberall allowance of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall and necessaries to the souldiers; This discord seemed to draw to a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous distraction of the Common-wealth, the vanquished part being full of malice, and the Conquerours of presumption: the one wanting power, the other right to command and rule; The Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine others of the neutralitie, fearing the sequell, perswaded the King to come to a treaty with the Lords: but hee made shew but of a slight regard, he made of these dealings: let them (saith hee) stay untill their numerous po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer have wearied them, and eate out their provision: and then we will finde a time, to talke with them at my leasure; But the Lords suspecting the devise, stopt all passages, and beset the <hi>Thames:</hi> generally protesting not to depart, without conference with the King face to face. The King having neither strength to resist, nor roome to scape, consented to a treatie; And to that end desired the Lords to come to him into the Tower; but they refused that place of meeting, upon feare of false measure, untill the King permitted them, to search diligently, and come as strongly as they thought meet; then they came to the King well guarded, and after a few cold complements, and strange sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations, they layd before him his proceedings against them at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> his Letters which hee sent to the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> contrary to his word: for the raysing of armes against them: his agreement with the French King for the yeelding up of <hi>Callice,</hi> and other strong houlds which hee had in posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in those parts, with divers other poynts of dishonourable dealing, and negligent government. What should the King then have done or said, all these objections were so evident and evill, that there was no place left either for deniall or defence; Therefore ingenuously first with silence and patience, afterwards with teares and dejected countenance hee confessed his errors. And certainely the stiffe stomacks of the Lords, more relented to those luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme drops, then they would have done to his greatest violence. A mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was concluded the next day at <hi>Westminster,</hi> there to treate of these and other necessary affaires of the Realme; Then the Duke and the rest of the Lords departed, except the Earle of <hi>Darby,</hi> who stayed supper with the King; and all that time kept him in his proposed resolution: But when he was also gone, some of the abusers of the Kings eare, suggested that his going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was neither seemely nor safe, and would not only bring to his person present danger and contempt, but afterwards abasement, and abridgement to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7754:13"/>
his authoritie; whereupon the Kings minde turned. But the Lords being now nettled, feeling the Kings hand weake to governe the raynes, became the more violent, and sent him word that if hee did vacillate with them, and not come according to agreement, that they would choose a new King, who should bee more respective to his Nobilitie; This peremptory message so terrified the King, that hee not only went thither, but permitted the Lords to take their pleasure, they caused him much against his liking to remove out of the Court, <hi>Nevil</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Yorke, Foord</hi> Bishop of <hi>Duresme,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Chichester</hi> the Kings Confessor, the Lord <hi>Souch,</hi> the Lord <hi>Harmyworth,</hi> Lord <hi>Burnell,</hi> Lord <hi>Beamont,</hi> Sir <hi>Alberick Uear,</hi> Sir <hi>Baldwyne Bereford,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Alderbury,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Worth,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Clifford,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Lovell</hi> taking caution of them for their appearance, at the next Sessions of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

That the French Kings Daughter (being but a childe) was an unmeet match for King <hi>Richard,</hi> aswell for the disparitie of age, as for that the King had no issue by his first wife, and was not like to have any by this, except perhaps in his old age; But when the Duke saw his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would not availe ought, hee suborned the Londoners to make petition to the King, that seeing there was peace with France, hee would release them of the Subsidie, which was granted unto him in the last Parliament in respect of those warres to have beene maintained.

and therefore the King had neither cause to feare or dislike him. The King <note place="margin">Ann. 1396 R. 18.</note> seemeth to approve of their answers, and tobe satisfied, that <hi>Gloucester</hi> was what they reported him; And in the meane time <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>Yorke</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew themselves to their private houses; The Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> also went to <hi>Plashey</hi> in <hi>Essex.</hi> Vpon this accidentall separation, the King entred into Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell with <hi>Iohn Holland</hi> Earle of <hi>Huntington,</hi> his brother by the Mothers side, and <hi>Thomas Mowbray</hi> Earle of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> how the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> might bee suppressed, the cruelty which was but wavering (nay wanting in the King,) was soone confirmed by evill advise, and being once thereby enclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to blood, hee did not faile, either of lewd example of vile action to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or direction of cruell counsell what to doe; The plot is contrived, and according thereunto, the King and the Earle of <hi>Nottingham</hi> ryde together into <hi>Essex,</hi> as though they went on hunting: When they were in the Forrest, the Earle with a selected troope made stay in the Forrest, whilst the King with a small and unsuspected trayne came to <hi>Plashey,</hi> and there by the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> was lovingly entertained and freely feasted, pretending action <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed.</note> of present returne, the King desires the Duke to accompany him to <hi>London.</hi> The Duke supposing that only to bee intended indeed, which was in words and show pretended, went to horsebacke with the King, with a very small company, appointing the rest to follow him to <hi>London.</hi> They pleasantly rode together in familiar conference, untill they came neere the Earles ambusca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe, and then the King suddenly put spurres to his horse, the Duke following easily, was suddenly intercepted and stayed, and with violence hurryed to the <hi>Thames</hi> side, and there blindfolded, unvoluntarily shipped, and conveyed to <hi>Callice.</hi> The next day the King did invite the Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> to dinner, and gave him gratious countenance, but in his returne he was arrested and sent to prison; and so a double breach of hospitalitie is committed: when feasted by the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> the host is committed, and feasting the Earle of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke</hi> the guest is imprisoned. In the like manner was the Earle of <hi>Arundel</hi> and his sonne entrapped, and imprisoned; In the <hi>Isle of Wight</hi> the Common-people having notice of the apprehension of these three Noble men (whom they only affected) were in a great confusion, and there then wanted but a head, to draw them to commotion, every man murmured, and daring no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, stood wayting for one to lead them the way, every one being ready to follow, that which any one was loath to begin; The Dukes of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>Yorke</hi> upon information of these strong proceedings, gathered a strong Army, and came there with to <hi>London,</hi> where they were readily received by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, contrary to the Kings expresse command. But this seemed to bee a guard to themselves, rather then a regard to other. The King lay within foure miles of <hi>London,</hi> with a great power of armed men drawne out of <hi>Cheshire</hi> and <hi>VVales;</hi> and to pacifie the people, caused to be proclaimed, That the foresaid Lords were not questioned upon any old displeasures, but for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences lately committed: and for which they should be orderly appealed by the course of Law, and receive open and legall tryall in the next parliament, presently to begin: The like message was sent to <hi>London</hi> to the Dukes, to whom the King made faith, for the safety of their persons, and indemnitie of their goods, and that nothing should be done, without their privitie and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, all this was as rashly beleeved, as readily given out. Whereupon, the Dukes dissembled their feares, and dissolved their forces, in expectancy of what would ensue. The Parliament began at <hi>London,</hi> wherein Sir <hi>Iohn Bushy,</hi> Sir <hi>VVilliom Bagot,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Greene,</hi> were principall agents for the Kings purpose. These were the Kings chiefe Schoolemasters, both of cruelty and

deceit, they were proud, ignorant, and ambitious, and presuming on the Kings favour, professed themselves enemies to the antient Nobilitie, to the end, that being but Mushrumpes lately start up, they might become famous, by maintaining contention with greater persons. At first by their importunate travaile, especially of Sir <hi>Iohn Bashy,</hi> who had procured himselfe to be made Speaker of that Parliament, all the Chartells of pardon formerly granted by the King, were in this Parliament annulled. The Prelates perceiving the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of drawing divers of the Nobilitie, and others in question for their lives, did Constitute Sir <hi>Henry Piercy</hi> their Procurator, and depart the house, because they might not be present at judgement of blood. Then the Earles of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Warwicke</hi> were arraigned for those offences for which they were formerly pardoned, and thereupon were condemned to bee hanged, drawne, and quartered, but the King so moderated the severitie of this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that the Earle of <hi>Arundel</hi> was only beheaded, and the Earle of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke</hi> committed to perpetuall imprisonment in the <hi>Isle of Man;</hi> It was thought a point of policie and peace, not to bring the Earle, Duke of <hi>Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>

               </note> upon the disdaine, of the undeserved favours and advancement of some persons about the King, or disliking that his Soveraigne should bee so abused and abased by such, or else to make knowne his owne sufficiency, in matters of controlement, and direction, one day having familiar conference with the Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> complained that the King, too much undervalued the Princes of the blood royall, and much discouraged the rest of the Nobilitie from intermedling in publike affaires; That in steed of these, hee was wholly guided by a few new-found, and new-fangled Favourites, of dunghill-breed, of base qualities, having no sufficiency, either for Councell for peace, or cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage for warre, who being of all men both the most unhonest, and most una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which hatefulnesse of the one, and contempt of the other, were general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly despised in all the Realme, whereby the Honour of the Kings person was much blemished: for ungrate and ungratious adherents to a King, are alwayes the path to hatred and contempt; secondly, the safety of his estate might bee endangered: for extraordinary favours to men of apparant weake or bad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, doth breed insolency in them, and discontentment in others, two dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous humours in a Common-wealth. Thirdly, the dignitie of the Realme was much impayred, whose valour and successe being guided by the ill suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of such unlucky leaders, stood never in the like doubts of danger and distresse, as now it did, so that matters of peace were tumultuous and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and atchievements in warre were never brought to honourable conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; And that it was high time, that the King should looke unto them, for the Nobilitie grew out of heart, the Commons out of hope, and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were fallen into a discontented murmuring. And this hee affirmed, hee sayd, not for any grudge to any particular person, but for griefe for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like grievance and good will to his Soveraigne, and therefore desired the Duke, who was one of the Kings Cabinet counsell, to discover unto him, these deformities and dangers, that by repayring the one, hee might happily repell the other. These words procured to the Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> both great offence, and great glory. At the delivery whereof the Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> made shew of good liking, well approving them, and made promise of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere dealing therein. And had they afterward by him, beene as faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and by the King as friendly taken, as they were freely and friendly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, many mischiefes had beene avoided, but both failed. For though the Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> had formerly sided with the Lords: yet afterwards, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7754:17"/>
rather to bee lifted amongst great, then good men, hee made sale of his honour, with his honestie, to nurse his pleasure, and hold grace with the King; wherein he was so seated, that the murthering of the Duke of <hi>Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and the execution of the Earle of <hi>Arundel,</hi> was committed principally to his care and charge, and now the more to wind himselfe into the Princes favour, he exaggerated the late relation, and intermixed with some truth, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lies, making the truth seeme worse then it was; whereby the King not enduring the searching of his sores by any private observer, endevoured ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to punish the boldnesse, then examine the truth of these reports, his eares being so duld with continuation of flatteries, that he accounted all too sharp, that was but savourie, approving only that which was presently pleasant, though, afterwards it proved most poisonous. This observation from hence may arise, that no strange accident doth at any time happen, but it is some way, either foreshowne, or foretold. But because these warnings are oftentimes either not marked, or misconstrued, or contemned, the events are accounted inevitable, and the premonition vaine. The King being touched with one Duke, and tickled by another, was not at first resolved what to doe; At length hee convokes the Dukes before his Councell, demands of <hi>Norfolke</hi> if hee would publickly avouch what hee had secretly suggested; <hi>Norfolk</hi> thinking it at that time no point of wisdome, to shrinke from, or shuffle in his tale, repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a confident brow, all whatsoever he had formerly related; But the Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> who could not be dasht out of countenance, when he was in a good cause: After a short pawse, as seeming rather amazed at the strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the matter, then abashed at the guilt, humbly thanked the King, that hee had not given over-hasty credit to matters of such tender touch, desiring him to continue yet awhile, the respight of his displeasure, and to reserve his judgement from prejudicating; Then he orderly repeates the truth of the passages in the primer conference, the occasion and the end thereof, and what was related more then what hee now repeated, he resolutely denyes, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it falsly surmised by his adversary, either upon malice to picke a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, or sycophancy to picke a thanke, for which hee pronounced him a false, unworthy forger of scandalous, and seditiouslyes, thereby trecherously ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinating to seduce the King, to destroy his Nobilitie, and to raise some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance in the Kingdome, which by (his Soveraignes permission) hee offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to justifie against him, by order of the field, <hi>Norfolkes</hi> stomacke not inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to undergoe scornes, could not disgest these termes of disgrace, but stiffly stood in defence of his relation; and for the maintaining thereof, accepted and craved the combat. The King made shew as though hee would have otherwayes quieted the contention; but when the Dukes persevered reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, to demand the tryall by Duell, and that thereupon they had flung downe their gages. The King gives way thereunto, assignes the place at <hi>Coventry,</hi> the time, the moneth of August following, against which time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was made accordingly. At the day prefixed, the parties appeared, well associated with friends and allyes; The Duke of <hi>Anmerle</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that time, high Constable, the Duke of <hi>Surry</hi> high Marshall, who came to the lists honourably attended, in sutable liveryes, each of their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants carrying tipstaves, for cleering the field and ordering thereof. About the time of prime, the Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> mounted upon a white Courser, his Caparison of blew and greene Velvet, embrodered thicke with Swannes and Antelops, armed at all points, with his sword drawne approcheth the lists; To whom the Constable and Marshall addressed themselves, making de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand who hee was; Hee answered, I am <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7754:17"/>
am come to doe my devoyre, against <hi>Thomas Mowbray</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> as a traytor to God, the King, the Realme, and mee; And then taking his oath upon the Evangelists that his quarrell was right and just, hee desired li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to enter, which graunted, he put up his Sword, pulld downe his Bever, signed himselfe on the forehead with the Crosse, taketh his Speare, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Barriers, dismounted and sate downe in a chayre of greene Velvet, placed in a Travers of greene and blew Velvet, at one end of the lists, King <hi>Richard</hi> enters the field with great pompe, accompanied with the Earle of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who came purposely out of <hi>France</hi> to see the Combat. The King was attended with all his Nobles, and a guard of ten thousand men in armes, to prevent all sudden and sinister tumults; His Majestie being seated, a king at Armes makes proclamation in King <hi>Richards</hi> name, that no man, except such, as were appointed to marshall the field, should touch any part of the lists, upon paine of death, which ended, another Herold cryeth: Behold here <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> Appellant, who is entred into the Lists royall, to doe his devoyre, against <hi>Thomas Mowbray</hi> Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke,</hi> upon paine to bee accounted false and recreant.</p>
            <p>When the Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> mounted the Caparisons of his horse of crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Velvet, embrodered with Lyons of silver, and Mulberry trees proper: ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his oath before the Constable and the Marshall, that this quarrell was just and true, entred the field, crying alowd, God ayde the right, and then lighted from his horse, placing himselfe in a chayre of crimson Velvet, opposite at the other end of the Lists. The Marshall viewed their Speares, and carryed the one himselfe to the Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and sent the other by Sir <hi>Albericke Tressell</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Norfolke;</hi> This done, Proclamation was made, to addresse themselves to the encounter. The Dukes speedily mounted, and closed their Bevers, casting their Speares into their rests; when the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets sounded, and the Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> put his horse forward: But before <hi>Norfolke</hi> stirred: the King cast downe his Warder, and the Combatants had their Speares taken from them, and returned to their Chaires, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained by the space of two houres, whilst the King was in Councell; Atlast Sir <hi>Iohn Bonray,</hi> (after silence proclaymed) read their doome, which was, that in asmuch as the Dukes Appellant and defendant had honourably appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the royall Lists, and were not only ready, but forward to derayne the Combat; For that this was a businesse of great Consequence, for the avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the effusion of Christian blood, the King by the advice of his Councell, had decreed that <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> should within fifteene dayes, depart the Realme, and within the space of ten yeares, not to returne upon paine of death without the Kings speciall leave first obtained; Then upon a second Proclamation, the Secretary pronounced the decree of Banishment against the Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> for that hee had used seditious words, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he could produce no proofe; and that the King should take the revenews of his land, untill he was satisfied of such sommes of money, as hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived out of the Kings coffers, for the payment of the garrison of <hi>Calice;</hi> And he further sayd, That the King commanded upon paine of his high dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, that no man from thenceforth should presume to petition the King in behalfe of either of those Dukes to alter this Decree. The sentence thus read, the King called the exiles before him, and tooke of them a solemne oath, that they should never converse together, nor willingly come into each others company, lest common discontent should draw first reconcilement, and after desire of revenge. But this pollicie is ever weake to prevent such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, for oathes are often spurnd aside, when they lye like rubbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the way to honour, or revenge; Therefore the Princes of the Realme, have with more safetie for the most part, abolished the use of abjuration, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by death, extinguish the power, or by pardon, alter the will of great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors from entring into desperate, and dangerous attempts, which men in miserie and disgrace, with more vehemency begin, and with more obstinacy continue: When the <hi>Samnites</hi> had so enclosed the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, that they had neither space to fight, nor meanes to flye, and without fight had enforced them to yeeld; they sent for advise to one <hi>Pontius,</hi> an antient Ruler of their State, what to doe with them: His answer was, that the <hi>Romans</hi> should bee permitted to depart without losse, or derision: But this not pleasing those that were either cruell or covetous, <hi>Pontius</hi> was the second time consulted with: whose answer then was, That the <hi>Romans</hi> should bee generally slaughtered, and not one spared; This contrarietie of advise, brought <hi>Pontius</hi> into suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of dotage which he suspecting, came in person, and maintained both to be advantageous; The first by an unexpected favour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might provoke the <hi>Romans</hi> to a perpetuall friendship, the second would deferre the warres for many yeares: The third, Counsell (quoth he) there cannot be given, that may be fafely followed; yes, say the <hi>Samnites,</hi> to grant them their lives, but to take away their armes, and bootie. This is a way, replies old <hi>Pontius,</hi> which can neither win friends, nor weaken enemies, but may increase fury, but not diminish force; So that that course of punishment is out of course, which doth neither reclaime the minde of man, nor restraine the might from mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous endevours.

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> tooke his leave of the King at <hi>Eltham,</hi> where foure yeares of his exilement were strooke off. The Dukes deportment, was with that moderation, that in his countenance, he made shew, neither of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row or stupiditie, and at his departure, let not fall any, either intemperate, or unseemely sillable. The Commons much lamented his departure, not sparing to exclaime, that it was against the Law of armes, the custome of the Realme and all Iustice, that hee should bee exiled, who had honourably endevoured to maintaine his appeale, according to the law of the field. Their affection was the more excessive, by reason the ground of his speech, was against those that the people hated, and he was the only survivor of the popular faction.

But the King of <hi>England,</hi> upon notice thereof, made such meanes, that the Mariage was stopt; Many things hapned this yeare, which were interpreted to presage, the revolt of the people, which hapned the yeare following; observation likewise was taken, that when King <hi>Richard</hi> brought his first wife with him out of <hi>Beanne,</hi> shee was no sooner on shore, but such a tempest arose, as the like thereof had not beene seene in many yeares before, wherein many shippes, and amongst them, the ship the Queene came in, was cast away.

The chiefest affaires of state, had beene for a long time ordered, according to private respects; whereby the Common-wealth, lost both the

The North parts were many times canvased, and by small, yet often Iosses, almost consumed by the Scots, who had taken many Castles and Townes, and defaced all the countrey, with slaughter and spoile; The South parts were divers times pillaged by the French, and in <hi>France</hi> many strong holds were lost for want of convenient succour, it was much about these times, that there was a secret pact renewed betweene the two Kings, for the delivery of <hi>Callice,</hi> and other pieces there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about to the French. But the performance thereof was resisted, both by the Court and Councell. <hi>Ireland,</hi> which in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, was kept in order and awe, and the people were taught Religion and civilitie, and well reclaimed, yeelding to the Kings coffers thirtie thousands <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> was suffered now to bee loose and licentious, and thereby the people growne rude and untractable, so that now the King instead of receiving, was enforced to bee at the charge to expend, thirty thousand pounds yearely.

Affaires of State in peace, were managed by those of weakest apprehension, by whose corrupt or ignorant counsell, the overthrow of the well-minded Nobilitie, was many times attempted, and at the last wrought. The profits and revenewes of the Crowne were let to farme, the King making himselfe Landlord of the Realme, challenging no greater pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge by his Raigne, but a dissolute and uncontrouled life. Great summes of money, were by new found, and unwonted meanes, every day rather exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, then voluntarily granted from the Subject: whereof no good did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, but the Kings private pleasures maintained, and his unworthy Favourites advanced; To these hee was beyond expectation, too liberall to continue, for which he was inforced to borrow, begge, and extort in many places, but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased not so much love by the one, as hee procured thereby hatred from the other, over and above Tenths and Fifteenes, which were many times gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red double in one yeare, strange impositions were devised and put in practise, sometimes exacting twelve pence <hi>per poll,</hi> of every subject throughout the Realme, sometimes of every religious person, male and female, vj. s. viij. d. of every secular Priest as much.

He sent certaine Commissioners, Bishops and Lords temporall, to all shires and corporations within the kingdome, to make knowne the Kings heavy displeasure against them, for having abetted
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7754:19"/>
the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and the Earles of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Warwicke,</hi> which <note place="margin">An. 1399. R. 23.</note> without due acknowledgement of the offence, and submission to his mercy, could not be pacified; Whereupon the chiefe in every shire, and all Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, made their acknowledgement and submission, under their hands and seales, for the redemption whereof, and for procuring of the Kings favour, insupportable fines were payd, and all, so impoverished, that few or none were able to subsist, none to resist. Strange and unheard-of oathes were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded upon the Commons for performance of what was under their hands and seales promised by them, nay to adde affliction to affliction, blancke Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were sealed, and delivered to the Kings use, wherein whatsoever hee pleased might bee inserted; These courses were quite contrary to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Henry</hi> the second, who though borne a stranger, and comming young to the Crowne, and in a scarce settled time maintained great warres, woon large Dominions, more then ever were hereditary, to any his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors had many children, and alwayes maintained a Kingly port, yet never demanded Subsidie of his subjects, neverthelesse hee left nine hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds, besides jewels and Plate of inestimable value in his Treasurie, having in all his life-time held a good correspondency betwixt his care and respect towards his subjects, and of their obedience and loyaltie to him. But this King bearing a heavy hand over his people, they beare an hard heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and hee being shallow in judgement, not of sufficiency enough to cover his vices, but with, or by a cloke of seeming powerfull, at length drave then many to revolt, whose resolution was rather, to run the hazard of ruine by rebellion, then to continue safety with slavery, and did, but waiting occasion to begin, which was thus offered; The King received advertisement out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that the wild Irish, had massacred all his garrison souldiers, and barbarously slaine, <hi>Roger Mortymer</hi> Earle of <hi>Marsh</hi> (who had beene declared heire to the Crowne) and that they proceeded with that cruelty, that wrath and rage being master of the field could incite, or cowardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours practise; This losse being greater, was much increased, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the ill-affected multitude. The King calleth his Councell, where it is much debated, whether were most convenient, for the King in person to goe, or to send his Generall, it was disputed, that wholly to subdue <hi>Ireland</hi> stood neither with possibilitie nor pollicy, for if it were quiet in possession, the governour might grow to that greatnesse, that hee might make himselfe absolute Monarch thereof, and therefore it was better to hold it certaine by feeble enemies, then uncertaine by over-potent friends. But how should those bogges and woods, which are more impregnable then the best fortified Townes in other Countries be compassed or conquered? And if the purpose were only to represse those Savage people, the warre was not so waighty, as should draw the King in person into the field; And therefore it was most convenient for him to stay in some place, from whence hee might sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> bee present indeed. But others were of opinion (and that not without good ground) that to subdue, and people <hi>Ireland,</hi> was a matter neither difficult or dangerous, but acceptable and honourable to God and the King; For this Realme of <hi>England,</hi> is truly storied, to have beene as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passible for bogges and woods as <hi>Ireland.</hi> But the Conquerours kept not their souldiours idle in garrison, whereby the bodyes might bee made disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: and so unfit for labour, or hard travaile. But they held as well them, as the Natives continually in action, either in exercising their armes, or in ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing fortifications, or making mightie high wayes, or else in drayning and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of bogges; by which meanes the countrey was made habitable, and the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7754:20"/>
wayes passible, and the people found it better to preferre subjection with plentie, before liberty with penurie. That the <hi>Romans</hi> kept many more large territories in quiet Obedience (so long as there was amitie, amongst themselves) without either feare or danger of popular Governours, either by severing them into divers small Provinces; or assigning to every province, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Officers of inferiour rankes, as Lieutenants and Provosts, whereof one was able to retaine the other, or by making their offices but annuall; But chiefly by retayning their wives and children, as pledges of their dutifull obedience. That the danger was the more to be feared, lest a weake enemy, whilst hee is contemned, should gather strength, and to bee able to stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tearmes of withstanding; That it was a pittifull policie for assurance of peace, to make all waste like a Wildernesse, and in stead of men to have domination of nothing but trees and beastes. That by so doing, the King should lose the revenew of a fruitfull Countrie, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of wealthy subjects, which are the surest treasure of a Prince; That hereby also the Majestie of his estate would be impayred; For (as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> sayth) the honour of a Kingdome consisteth in the multitude of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. That the Countrie being unfurnished of people, was open to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons invasions, and a great meanes to invite forraine and unsent-for guests. Lastly, if none of these respects would move, the King was bound in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to reduce those wilde people, to the true knowledge and worship of God, who did then either prophanely contemne him, or superstitiously serve him. These reasons so prevailed with the King, that hee gathered a mighty Army, with intention to goe in person into <hi>Ireland;</hi> But all his provision was at the Subjects charge. And where in times of danger, a discreet Ruler when necessitie shall enforce his absence, will give least cause of distaste unto his people. This King in peace, having beene no provider for warre, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to offend, when hee should have beene most carefull to winne their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. About the Feast of <hi>Pentecost</hi> hee set forward on his voyage mith ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men, but few souldiers, hee carried with him all his Treasure, jewels, plate, and kingly roabes; with him also the Duke of <hi>Anmerle,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Exceter,</hi> with diuers of the Nobles, and many Mitred Prelates, amongst whom was the Abbot of <hi>Westminster,</hi> a chiefe favourite. Hee also tooke with him, the sonnes of the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> and <hi>Hereford,</hi> whose favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers hee chiefely suspected; When hee came to <hi>Bristow</hi> (whether upon some matter, or meere malice, at first it is uncertaine) it was put into the Kings head, That <hi>Henry Piercy</hi> Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, intended some disloyall attempt against him; And therefore did not ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their service unto him in this expedition. Hereupon he by his Pursevant commanded rhe Earle with all his power, that could conveniently be raysed, to come unto him in person to <hi>Bristoll;</hi> The Earle by letter returneth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, desiring thereby his Majestie to take it into his more serious cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it was inconvenient for the <hi>Irish</hi> service, to draw men from such remote places, in regard the rebells were neither so many, nor so mightie, but that the King had strength sufficient at hand to suppresse them; That it was dangerous to disfurnish the North parts of their strength, thereby to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer opportunitie to the <hi>Scottish</hi> borderers (who were uncertaine friends in extremitie, and assured to bee enemies upon any such advantage) to make an inrode, therefore craved to be excused at that time for not attending.</p>
            <p>The King conceiving his command in this to bee contraried, yea contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, would not stand to reason the matter though he had small reason (things being as they were) not to have done so, but in an unadvised heate, proclaims
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7754:20"/>
the Earle and all his Confederates Traytors, and commands all their lands and goods to be seised to his use. The Earle much stomacking this disgrace, makes good the information, &amp; breakes out into open hostilitie, whilst the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in his voyage for <hi>Ireland,</hi> where upon his first arrivall, all things succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded prosperously, the King obtaining many Victories, yet without battaile; For the <hi>Irish</hi> not being under one government, were divided into many factions, so that seldome three sects joyned their strength, and study to one point; so that whilst they fought one by one, they were all easily subdued or slaine.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, some of the Nobilitie of <hi>England,</hi> with most of the common people, groning under the burden of their oppression, taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Kings absence, conspired to cut off that authoritie, that would not bee confined, and to bestow it upon some other, who was likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre, what <hi>Richard</hi> had ruined, resoluing if they fell short of their wish, they would sell that with glory in the field, which with certainty in peace they could not injoy. The only man upon whom they all pitcht, was <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> not upon any motion or desire of his, But because hee was of the blood Royall, and next heire male by discent, to the succession of the Crowne, of whose valour and vertue, honourable proofe had beene made; The only surviving man of qualitie, that had stood up against the King for the behoofe of the Common-wealth, for which hee had suffered much, both in honour and state. This attempt pleased, as possible to prove, and of necessitie to bee followed; Letters are secretly dispatched to the Duke, whose speedy returne into <hi>England</hi> they importune: affirming that aswell for the publike good of the Realme, as for their owne particular safeties, they were forced to use force against their King: soliciting him to be pleased, but to make the head, and they would furnish the body with an able army, to expell the misgoverned King, from his unbefitting government, and to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Crowne upon his head, who was more apt, and able to manage the same; That they would not only helpe him, in bare wishes, and advise, but would joyne hearts and hands, to adventure their lives, so that the perill should bee common to all, the glory only his.</p>
            <p>These Letters were cunningly compilde, and closely conveyed, by such as had more then common interest in the Dukes respect. Amongst whom was principall, <hi>Thomas Arundel,</hi> late-Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and <hi>Warren,</hi> who had beene first Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and then Archbishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and lastly of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who being amongst others the Bishops in the higher house of Parliament, at what time the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Arundel,</hi> the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Archbishop were convented, at least questioned, because Clergie men, by the Canons are commanded, not to be present at any tryall, or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life and death, hee with the rest, as they before had used, departed the house, upon this occasion being absent, hee with his brother were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of high treason, and after his brothers execution, the Archbishop was banished the Realme, his goods forfeited and seized, and his place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd upon <hi>Roger Walden.</hi> The Archbishop with his Confederates by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wayes, and in strange disguises came to <hi>Paris,</hi> and in the house of one <hi>Clomigey</hi> (where the Duke sojourned) met together, where having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained privacie and silence, the Archbishop used these words, or the like in sense.</p>
            <p>Wee are sent unto you (right high and most noble Prince) from the chiefe Lords and Peeres, and people of our kingdome, who grone under the burden <note place="margin">Archbish. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundels</hi> speech to <hi>Henry.</hi>

upon private wrongs or displeasures, nor upon desperate discontent, to set the State in combustion, to put the King in feare, the kingdome into a flame, nor to second the ambitious designes of any particular person: But to open unto you the deformities and decayes of our dissected estate, and to implore your ayde, for the stay of the precipitate ruine of the same. The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of your honourable atchievements, and your deserved reputation, thereby gained in our country, doth nothing else, but make remembrance of our present basenesse bitter unto us. Our victorious Armies, have heretofore beene famous and renowned, not only in the Ilands adjoyning, but in all parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> yea in <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> against the Infidels and Barbarians, so that all Christian Princes, have beene willing to imbrace our friendship, or unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to provoke us to hostilitie. But now both Welch and Scots, whom wee have so often beaten, and brought upon their knees, doe not only scorne and deride us, but the weake and miserable Irish, have shaken off their shackles, and glutted and enriched themselves, with our blood and spoyles, with these wee are now enforced to fight, not for glory, but for leave but to live, in so much as we are pittied by our friends, flouted by our enemies, and hated of our selves, it is confest that King <hi>Richard,</hi> hath led and sent great powers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these Countreys, but after such a manner, that they have much wasted the kingdome with their maintainance, but have by armes neither relieved our friends, or revenged us on our enemies. And no marvaile, since all our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, and diligent Commanders (the sinewes and nerves of an Army) are either beheaded, banished, or buried in disgrace and obscuritie, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of martiall affaires, is committed (without respect of abilities or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert) to the conduct and counsell of such as can best comply with the Kings variable disposition. Amongst whom antient Nobilitie is esteemed, but as a vaine bubble: vertue, and sufficiencie, are but a trappe to ensnare their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessours, it is a griefe to mee to speake it, but it helpeth not to hide that which every one seeth, our Ancestours lived in the highest pitch of perfect liberty, and wee of dejected servilitie, being used not like subjects but abjects, yea, flat slaves, not to one onely unrespective Prince, but to many his proud and presumptuous favourites, not alwayes the same, but every day fresh ones; And no sooner have we contented one, but new greedy stomacks are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, whose extortion, and exactions, have devoured more by bribes, then the enemy with the sword, what unwonted, nay what unheard-of projects are now invented, and daily practised, without either measure or end, yea often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without need, but if any bee, it proceedeth rather from riotous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, then necessary charges: great summes of money are every minute pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and pulled from the honest minded subject, to bee unprofitably wasted upon prodigall spendthrifts; and if any man impugne these most insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble taxations, or but speake in the defence of the libertie of a subject; Then either by surmised imputation of capitall crime, or by aggravation of small causes, by far-fetcht circumstances, and strayned constructions, or else by open crueltie and force, his life or libertie, or both, is called in question, it were too tedious, too odious, too frivolous, to produce particular examples; The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable losse of your noble Vncles, and other honourable friends, and your owne present estate, cannot easily bee forgotten, nay I presume, there is no man of ranke, or fashion within the Realme, who either in his owne person, or children, or in his deere friends, or neere allyes, but may easily finde, that no man hath certaintie, to enjoy the safeguard of his goods, or the use of his liberty, or suretie of his head, but rich men of the one, and good men in the other, are continually in hazard. This is our case, but what is the remedie,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7754:21"/>
wee have patiently suffered, and sued humbly for ease, But our patience hath procured increase of punishment, and our complaints more stripes: By the one our livings, by the other our liues are daily devoured. Now therefore are wee unwillingly compelled, to endevour to shake from our shoulders, this too too uneasie yoke, and submit our lives, and estates to the command, of some more moderate and worthy person, not so much for the griefe of our miseries which are past, nor for the paine of our present distresses, as for feare of worse dangers, which are most likely to follow, the chiefe of the antient Nobilitie. The King hath cut off the Commons, hee hath pared to the quick, and still he harroweth the Countrey, as if now but newly conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whereby our nakednesse is bared to our Adversaries, and wee are made utterly unable, either to recover that which is lost, or to retaine that little that is left. To whom shall wee now complaine? from whence shall wee seeke succour? from whence expect ayde? you (royall Sir) are only hee, which in right should, in wisdome can, and in goodnesse (wee presume) will releeve us: to the King in blood you are the neerest, to us in love deerest, you ought theresore to undertake the rule of that that his weaknesse cannot well weild; Your yeares are well stayd, from the loose fagaries of youth, and have beene so spent, that your former actions, have made sufficient proofe of your full abilities, for government of greatest charge, nothing therein by you past, nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth excuse, and it is vaine to feare, what is to come; Your paines and perill formerly undergone for the good of your Country, putteth us all in good hope, that in this extremitie you will not forsake us: wee are in a leaky ship, ready to sinke, in an old house ready to fall, and therefore humbly call and crave for your helpe to succour and save us: now or never show your selfe to favour your Countrey-men, and free us, free your selfe, and the whole State from dangers, and decayes, by taking into your hands, the Scepter and sway thereof, and to reduce the now tyrannous government to a Princely freedome, in combining the Soveraigntie in one, with the libertie of all; Omit not this occasion, but make your vertue and valour appeare, by relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving most miserable wretches, from their unmercifull oppressours. This we are constrayned to offer, and intreate, this is both honourable for you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and easie to performe, being a taske worthy your toyle; And so much the rather, since no Prince by any people, hath beene desired with greater affection, nor shall more dutifully bee obeyed then your royall selfe.</p>
            <p>This speech the Duke heard with attention, and entertained with great moderation and modestie, his answer to that part that touched the King, was <note place="margin">Earle <hi>Henries</hi> answer.</note> respective and well tempered, rather lamenting his weaknesse, then blaming his malice, as touching himselfe, hee spake so soberly, that hee seemed rather worthy of a Kingdome then desirous thereof, hee affirmed his life, had been alwayes free from malicious, and ambitious attempts, that stayednesse of yeares, had now settled his minde from aspiring thoughts: That experience of former dangers, had bred in him a wary reguard, in such a waighty busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that to cast a King out of his State, was an enterprise, not hastily to bee attempted, nor easily effected; And though the matter were neither impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor difficult, the rarenesse of the fact, as wanting president, would make the action seeme injurious to all indifferent mindes; And hee that shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a kingdome, upon opinion of desert: doth charge himselfe with greater expectation; and how honourable soever hee shall compare himselfe, hee shall never want his deadly enviers; Besides this, in civill dissentions, the faith of the multitude is flitting, and danger is to be doubted from every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular person: That it is possible that all may fall away, but impossible to be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7754:22"/>
safe from every one, how ever friendly in semblance. Therefore hee rather wisht to spend the remainder of his yeares, as hee did, obscurely, in a safe and certaine estate, then to thrust himselfe upon those pikes of perills, which being once entred into, are dangerous to follow, and deadly to forsake, whereas in private attempts a man may step, and stop when, and how, and as often as he pleaseth; But the ayme at a Kingdome, hath no middle course, betwixt the life of a Prince, or the death of a Traytor. The Archbishop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, saying, The state wherein you now stand, is neither so safe or certaine as you conceive: Indeed by rejecting our request, you may avoyd certaine dignity, and with that uncertaintie and contingent dangers: But shall procure most certaine destruction, both to your selfe and us; For this attempt cannot be kept secret long from the King; And the best Princes are tender in poynts of Soveraigntie, and beare a nimble eare to the touch of that string; and it prejudiceth more a subject, to be thought worthy of a Kingdome, then it will profit him to have refused the offer of it. What then will hee doe, that putteth the chiefest securitie of his Raigne, in the basenesse, and barenesse of his Subjects: who being perpetually possessed with jealosie, maketh every presumption a proofe; and every light surmise a strong suspition against them; And of certaintie, if the generall favour, and the love which the people bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth you, hath as now bereaved you of your libertie; This their generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, will not leave your life untouched, As for us, if wee faint in our intent, or faile in the enterprise, farewell all; wee shall but bee like lambes amongst Lyons: And no losse by conquest can bee more grievous unto us, then the Kings raigne over us: assuredly now wee have gone on too farre to goe backe: And the time is long since past, when you for <hi>ambition,</hi> and wee for <hi>envy,</hi> might seeme to attempt against the King; The possession of the Crown, must now bee the sole sanctuary, and refuge for us both. Examples of the like attempts, are neither rare, nor worne out of practise, nor so farre off to bee fetched; Wee might instance in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Adulphus.</hi> In <hi>Denmarke</hi> and <hi>Swedland;</hi> In the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> in this Kingdome, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and since the Conquest, instance were to bee given of the like, that there is alwayes difficultie in things that tend to much excellency; But they that are afraid of every shadow, will hardly at first truly apprehend the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. And as he was about to proceed, to justifie the lawfulnesse, the Duke interrupted him, and sayd, Where necessitie doth enforce, it is needlesse to use speech, either of easinesse or lawfulnesse; Necessitie will runne through brazen walls, and cannot bee bounded by lawes; I have had my full share in these calamities, and I wish you knew, with what griefe I have beheld you. What recompence have I received, for all my labour and expence in the Kings service, but the death of my deare Vncles, and neerest friends, my owne banishment, the base imprisonment of my children, and the losse of my goods and inheritance? And what hath beene returned unto you for your blood, so often spent in these unfortunate warres, but perpetuall pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of unnecessary exactions, daily massacres, and insupportable slavery, I have tired my patience in apprehension of my owne miseries and pitying yours: remedy them hitherto I could not (had I beene never so willing:) if now I can, I will not refuse, to sustaine that part, which your importunitie doth enforce upon mee; if wee prevaile, wee shall regaine our liberties: If wee misse, our estate can bee no worse then it is; And if wee must perish, either guilty or guiltlesse, it is more noble to hazard our selves, either to win our lives, or dye in defence of our liberties. And though our lives were safe, which in truth they are not, yet to desert the State, and sleepe still in this sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7754:22"/>
would argue either negligence, or stupiditie in us, or both. It remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth now that wee use secrecie, and celeritie, taking hold of the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the Kings absence presents unto us; For in enterprizes, which never are commended before atchieved, delayes are dangerous; And safer it is, to bee found in open action, then private Counsell: For they that deliberate only to rebell, have rebelled already; Hereupon the Confederates returne for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to provide armes, and prepare necessaries against the Dukes arrivall, who presently acquaints the King of <hi>France,</hi> that hee intended to goe to visit his kinsman, <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and obtained from him Letters of safe conduct, there hee waged some souldiers, with whom from <hi>Callice</hi> he made for <hi>England,</hi> giving forth at his comming aborde, that hee only endevoured to regaine, the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and the rest of his lawfull inheritance, which King <hi>Richard</hi> wrongfully detained from him; with him came <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> heire to <hi>Richard</hi> late Earle of <hi>Arundel;</hi> the residue of his retinue exceeded not twenty launces, so that it is <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forward.</note> hard to judge, whether was the greater marvaile, either that hee durst at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or that hee did prevaile with so small a company; But his confidence was in the favour, and assistance of the people in the Realme; Hee for a time did beare up for <hi>England;</hi> but not in a straight course, but hulling about the shore, making show to land sometimes on one coast, sometimes on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thereby to discover what forces were in readinesse, either to receive, or resist him.</p>
            <p>In the meane time <hi>Edmond</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> the Kings Vncle, and Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, having intelligence of the Duke of <hi>Herefords</hi> designe, Convoked <hi>Stafford</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chichester,</hi> Lord Chancelor, <hi>William Scroope</hi> Earle of <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> the Lord Treasurer, Sir <hi>Iohn Bushy,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Greene,</hi> Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Bagot,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Russell,</hi> and others of the Kings privy Councell, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Counsell, what was best to be done; Where it was concluded de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully by some, unskilfully by others, and by all pernitiously for King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> to quit the Sea coasts, to leave <hi>London,</hi> and to make the randevow at Saint <hi>Albones,</hi> to gather forces to oppose the Duke, who was lately landed about the Feast of Saint <hi>Martine,</hi> without any resistance or rub, at <hi>Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spur</hi> in <hi>Holdernesse,</hi> whose side was by nothing more advantaged, then by <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse.</hi>
               </note> that dissembling, and deceitfull deliberation of the Kings Councell upon his arrivall, <hi>Henry Piercy</hi> Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> surnamed <hi>Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spur</hi> his sonne, the Earle of <hi>Westmerland,</hi> the Lords, <hi>Nevill, Rosse,</hi> and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,</hi> and many other personages of honour came unto him, whose acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion both increased reputation to their cause, and was a great countenance and strength, to the Dukes further purposes. But first they tooke an oath of him, <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Heref.</hi> sworne not to doe, or suffer any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to bee done to King <hi>Richard.</hi>
               </note> that hee should neither procure, nor permit any bodily harme to bee done to King <hi>Richard,</hi> and thereupon they pawnd to the Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> their honours, to joyne with him in all extremitie, to prosecute the Kings mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Councellors. The Common-people desperate upon new desires, head and headlong flocked to these Noblemen. The better sort for love to the Common-wealth, some upon lenitie, and itching desire of change, others to repayre their distressed and decayed estates, who all setting up their rests up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a generall disturbance were (in conceit) then most safe, when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon state was most unsure: So betweene the one and the other, the number in short time increased to thirty thousand able souldiers. The Duke finding successe to favour him, not only beyond expectation, but even above his wish, Hee followed the chanell whilst the current went strong; and cutting off unnecessary delayes, with all celeritie he hasted to <hi>London,</hi> that possessing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7754:23"/>
himselfe thereof, being the chiefe place within the kingdome for strength and store, hee might best there make the seat of Warre, and be easiest accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with provision and amunition.</p>
            <p>In this expedition, no opposition was seene, nor hostilitie showne, but in his passage the Gentlemen of best ranke and qualitie, joyned themselves unto him, som for affection, others for feare, but most in hope of reward after vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, every one though upon causes dislike, yet with like ardent desire contending, lest any should seeme more forward then they. In every place also where hee made stay, rich gifts, and pleasant devises were presented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, with large supply of necessaries, farre above his necessitie. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people with showtes and acclamations gave their applause, extolling the Duke as the only man of courage, saluting him King: with contumelious termes depraving <hi>Richard,</hi> as a simple and sluggish man, a dastard, a niddie, and altogether unworthy to beare rule without rule, rayling at the one, and without reason flattering the other. The Duke was no niggard of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, nor negligent of popular behaviour, knowing the common people are much delighted with affable gestures, accounting that for courtesie, which the severer sort reckon abasement. At <hi>London</hi> hee was richly and royally entertained, with Processions and Pageants, and many triumphant devises and showes, and the unable multitude (who otherwise could not,) by their words, wishes, and wills, did testifie their loving affection towards him.</p>
            <p>At which time there appeared not any memory of faith or allegiance to King <hi>Richard,</hi> But (as in sedition it alwayes appeareth,) as the most swayd, all went. The Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> was mustering at Saint <hi>Albones</hi> for the King; But as the people out of divers Countries were drawne thither, many of them protested that they would doe nothing, to the prejudice of the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> who they affirmed was unjustly expelled his Country, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully kept from his inheritance. Then the Earle of <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Bushy,</hi> Sir <hi>William Bagot,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Greene,</hi> forsooke the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and fled to <hi>Bristol,</hi> intending to passe the Seas i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o <hi>Ireland</hi> to the King.</p>
            <p>These foure were they that were supposed to have taken of the King, his kingdome to farme, and therefore were so odious to the people, that their presence turned away many of the Subjects hearts. Nay, it is probable, that more for displeasure taken against them, then against the King; the revolt was enterprised. For they being the only men of credit, and authoritie with the King, under false cover of obedience, they wholly governed both the Realme and him, abusing his name, either against his will, or without his knowledge, insomuch that hee was cleerely innocent of many things, which passed under his Commandement; But the people could not indure, that two or three should rule all, not because they were not sufficient, but because they were in favour: and they distasted the King, in that hee permitted them whom hee might have bridled, or to runne without respect, at least for that hee was ignorant of that hee should have knowne, and by conniving at their faults, made them his owne, and opened thereby the gappe to his destruction. For it is as dangerous to a Prince, to have hurtfull &amp; hatefull Officers in emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent places, as to bee hurtfull and hatefull to himselfe. The Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> either amazed at the sudden change, or fearing his adventure, if hee should proceed to resistance; gave over the cause, and preferred present securitie, before dutie with danger, giving occasion thereby to bee suspected to favour the Duke of <hi>Lancasters</hi> proceeding, and thereupon all the other Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, either openly declared for the Duke, or secretly wished his welfare;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7754:23"/>
And abandoning all private directions, and advise, adjoyned themselves to the common course, hoping thereby of greater safetie.</p>
            <p>In the meane time Duke <hi>Henry</hi> being at <hi>London,</hi> entred into consultation with his Confederates what way was best to take, amongst whom it was then concluded, finally to uncrowne King <hi>Richard,</hi> and constitute Duke <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Herefard</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into Councell at <hi>London.</hi> Warre pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst King <hi>Richard.</hi>
               </note> King in his stead; And to that end open warre was proclaimed against King <hi>Richard,</hi> and all his partakers, as enemies to the peace, and quiet of the kingdome; Pardon also was promised, to all those that would submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to follow the present course, otherwise no favour to bee expected; Not one of the Nobilitie durst oppose himselfe in these designes, some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to play all their estate at one cast, kept themselves at libertie, to bee directed by successe of future event; others consented in termes of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full construction, with intent to interpret them afterwards, as occasion should change; But the most part directly, and resolutely entred into the action, and made their fortunes sharers with Duke <hi>Henryes,</hi> in the danger, though not in the Honour, to whom Duke <hi>Henry</hi> used this speech.</p>
            <p>I am, as you see, at your procurement returned, and by your meanes have <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lancasters</hi> Oration.</note> undertaken armes, to vindicate our common libertie, hitherto wee have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperously proceeded; But in what termes we now stand, I am altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted: As a private man I would bee loath to bee reckoned, being by you designed to bee a King, a Prince I cannot bee esteemed, whilst another possesseth the Crowne; your Title likewise is in suspence, whether to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Rebells or Subjects, untill you have made manifest, that your Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, was bound rather to the state of the Realme, then the person of the Prince; Now you are they, that have both caused this doubtfulnesse, and must cleere the point, your part still remaineth to bee acted, your vertue and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, must adde strength to this action; Wee have already ventured so farre, that all hope of pardon is drowned, so that if wee shrinke backe, and breake this enterprise, no mercy is to be expected, but butchery and gibbets, if wee delay the enterprise, wee shall lose the opportunitie, that now is offered, and give occasion of advantage to our adversaries. The peoples blood is up now on our sides, and nothing is wanting, but our care and your diligence; let us therefore now, not trifle more time in talking; but let us strike whilst the iron is hot, let us resolutely set forward, and possesse our selves speedily of all parts of the Realme, so shall wee be either able to keepe out our concurrent, or else to entertaine him little to his liking; Hereupon troopes of men are speedily sent into all quarters of the kingdome, to keepe King <hi>Richards</hi> partie from drawing to an head. The vulgar (as men broken with many bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens) readily entertained the first commers, and were not over-curious to side with the stronger; Duke <hi>Henry</hi> pursued the Treasurer, and his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">The Lord Treasurer pursued to <hi>Bristoll.</hi> The Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer with Sir <hi>Iohn Bushye</hi> surprised in <hi>Bristol</hi> Castle, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> to <hi>Bristoll,</hi> where hee found the Castle fortified against him, but in foure dayes hee forced it, and therein surprised the Lord Treasurer, Sir <hi>Iohn Bushy,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Greene,</hi> whom the common people eagerly pursued to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, no defence could bee admitted, no excuse heard, no respite obtained, but still their rage continued, crying against them, that they were Traytours, blood-suckers, that had abused the King, and undone his Subjects to enrich themselves; And through their clamorous and importunate instance, the day following the Earle of <hi>Wiltshire</hi> with the rest were beheaded. This Earle of <hi>Wiltshire</hi> was <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Scroope,</hi> in the twenty one yeare of <hi>Richard</hi> the second, Created Earle of <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> and made Lord Treasurer, hee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased the <hi>Isle of Man,</hi> and dyed without issue. Sir <hi>William Bagot,</hi> whilst the other went to <hi>Bristoll,</hi> posted to <hi>Chester,</hi> and pursuit being made
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7754:24"/>
after the most, hee alone escaped into <hi>Ireland.</hi> This execution partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it pleased the people, and partly because it excluded all hope of the Kings pardon, caused them to cleave more firme unto the Duke, which great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increased both his hope, and glory, as having offers of so large ayde, and so little need.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the newes of the Dukes arrivall, and occurrences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, part true, part false, and all enlarged by many circumstances (as fame increaseth by going) was related to the King, hee then being intangled with other broyles in <hi>Ireland,</hi> at the receipt whereof, hee caused the Sonnes of the Dukes of <hi>Glocester</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> to be imprisoned at the Castle at <hi>Trim,</hi>

               </note> and for the speedier dispatch, to goe into <hi>England,</hi> left most of the provision behinde, hasting and shuffling together, as his present hast did enforce, being both unskilfull, and unfortunate himselfe, and voide of all good direction from others, and with more haste then good speed, he tooke shipping, and within the space of three nights, with the Dukes <hi>Aumerle, Exceter,</hi> and <hi>Surry,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>London, Lincolne,</hi> and <hi>Carlile,</hi> and some others hee arrived at <hi>Milford</hi> haven in <hi>Wales,</hi> in which countrey-men he reposed his <note place="margin">King <hi>Richard</hi> arriveth at <hi>Milford</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> chiefe trust for safetie; But when hee saw that contrary to expectation, that as well there as in all other places, the people flocked to the Duke and fled from him, and those that were with him were all wavering, and some revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, all his devises were disturbed, and hee resolute what course to take, on the one side he was confident, his cause was right, his conscience being cleere from any great bad demerit, on the other side, hee saw the adversaries great strength, and the whole power of the Realme bent against him; And being <note place="margin">Discouraged.</note> more abashed by the one, then incouraged by the other, hee was perplexed in uncertaine termes, either where to stay, or whither to stirre, wanting both knowledge and resolution himselfe, in cases of such difficultie, and obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to unfaithfull counsell; Some advised him to march further into the land, before his owne forces fell from him, alledging that fortune seconds valour; That in all places hee should finde some, who of dutie, for favour, or hire, <note place="margin">His Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors disagree.</note> would joyne with him, others perswaded him to returne into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and from thence to returne when sufficiently strengthened. But the King unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with martiall affaires, rejected both counsells, and in taking a middle course (which alwayes in extremes of that kinde is the worst) hee resolved to stay in <hi>Wales,</hi> to attend to what head this humour would rise. The Duke upon advertisement of the Kings landing, with great power speeds to <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lancaster</hi> marcheth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King. The Lord Steward dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solveth the Kings hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</note> whereupon <hi>Thomas Piercy</hi> Earle of <hi>Worcester,</hi> steward of the Kings houshold, to vindicate the proclayming his brother the Earle of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> traytor, openly in the Hall before all the Kings servants, broke his staffe of office, and departed to the Duke, willing the rest to shift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in time, hereby hee lost his reputation on both sides, being by the one accounted a corrupter, by the other a betrayer of the King; The rest by his Example, more fearefull then faithfull, tooke every man his owne way, and scattered. And they that in the Kings prosperitie, would have contended to bee foremost, now together draw backe, and like Swallowes forsake that house in Winter, where all the Summer they did feed and foyle. Betweene faint souldiers, and false friends, the King is abandoned: Looke on hee might remedie it hee could not, as not of force to punish that, which he never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to prevent, his present remedy is patience (a cold comfort) his only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, complaint (a weake weapon;) Betweene both, thus hee vents his passion. <note place="margin">King <hi>Richard</hi> expostulateth with himself.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And doe (saith hee) all forsake mee? doth their faith and my good fortune
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7754:24"/>
both end together? Had I forsaken them in time, I had not beene forsaken of others, who once loved me better, but now are able to hurt me more. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the blindnesse of my judgement, and so there is no friendship in flattery, nor trecherie in plaine truth, and wish I had but as much space to reforme this error, as I am like to have time to repent it; But ah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they would not suffer mee to be wise when I might, and now they have made mee wretched, they flye from mee, they were content to bee the causes, but will not bee compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of my calamities, such attendants are like Crowes to a dead carkasse, which flocke to it, not to defend it, but to devour it, and no sooner have they bar'd the bones, but they are gone.</p>
            <p>Thus having lost both the feare and affection of his Subjects, distracted, without comfort, counsell, or courage, like an Exile in his owne kingdome, hee remaineth in <hi>Wales,</hi> not daring to goe to <hi>London,</hi> and no man desirous to come to him, shifteth still from place to place, fearing all things, but most mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking the present. The Duke pursueth him with all his power, but the King was too weake to doe any thing by force, and yet too great to bee undisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, neither had hee any assurance of those few hee had. At length hee came to the Castle of <hi>Conoway,</hi> and there utterly destitute of helpe, or hope, hee stood divided in minde, which way to bend his course; his followers were more ready to oppugne the opinion of others, then to give direction themselves, as seeing better what to shun, then what to follow: and as it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes chanceth in desperate causes, that course is commonly made choice of, whereof the opportunitie is already past. Some advised him that it was then time, rather to thinke of saving of life, then recovering his estate, give place (say they) to the current of this furie, let it haue its full source, and when it is at the highest, it will turne againe, and then you shall have the tyde as strong with you, as it is now against you; Therefore give a little space, for the bad to draw backe, for the good to put forward. Treason gets ground at the first, but good counsell gathers strength by cunctation. The mindes of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude are only constant in unconstancy, and persevere only in change, in dislike of things present, they desire new, wherewith they rest not long contented, but are many times glutted with the first sight; And how can they long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Raigne of him, who mounting the Throne only by their favour, and strength, shall hold the same in a manner at their courtesie? every unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant command shall bee deemed ingratitude, every suit (though never so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable) if denyed, shall charge him shith unkindnesse: if Honour be not offered, they will bee much discontented, and upon every occasion of distast, thinke themselves as able to displace him, as they were to set him up; You may therefore (say they) for a time returne to <hi>Ireland,</hi> or goe to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law into <hi>France,</hi> you may assure your selfe of his assistance to stand upon your side to recover your losses; Others who were enemies to any counsell, how good soever it was, whereof themselves were not authors perswaded the King, that his enemies would rather dye then desist, not so much for enmitie to him, as for caution to themselves; For it is a hard matter to forgive, but impossible to forget the indignities, and injuries they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. And to omit what some Princes have done, what all will promise to doe; They will soone find fresh and bleeding examples, what you are like to doe, <hi>Glocester, Arundell, Warwicke,</hi> made insurrection not to amove you from the Crowne, but to remove from you, certaine misleaders of your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, an action more displeasing, then prejudiciall unto you. Atonement was made, Charters of free pardon were granted under the great Seale: But <note place="margin">Consulteth with his followers.</note> what followed, was the breach ever perfectly made up? did displeasure dye,

or was it only dissembled: but the present wants of their lives, have fully revenged their deaths. For had they lived, their countenance and authoritie would easily have stinted these strifes; But the manner of their death, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades an obstinate resistance in all your adversaries; As for the refuge to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Princes, you may peradventure receive of them faire entertainment, and allowance, yet growing burdensome, it may perchance fayle; But it is hard to draw a Prince into such a quarrell, and more hard by that meanes to prevaile: Or if you should, it is to bee feared, that the Victors will hold the benefit of the conquest to themselves, and not yeeld it over to you: Few countryes (that have required such ayde) but have beene by Forrainers sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued. This drew the <hi>Saxons</hi> into the land, who so assisted the <hi>Britons,</hi> that they could not be resisted from possessing their kingdome; yet helpe of strangers in cases of extremitie, is not altogether to bee contemned, but it is a remedy last to be trusted to, least to be tryed, but in no case altogether to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon. What then if you procure a Treatie, to see in what termes the people stand against you? it may be upon faire quarter, they will submit, but if they will persist to uncrowne you, an honourable stipend may be procured you, what shall you lose thereby, you have no childe to bee disinherited, the chiefe motive to make men greedy to get, and carefull to retaine? And as for your selfe you shall bee but translated from a steepe and slippery hill, to a smoothe and pleasant playne, from dangerous travaile, to secure rest; And if there be no solace without safetie, no felicitie without firmenesse, you shall finde the private life, not only more pleasant, but more happy then your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall state. The tallest trees are weakest in the toppes; and envy alwayes aymeth at the highest; But you shall lose (you will say) the credit ahd coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a King, so shall you the cares and casualties; The Crowne and Scepter are things most waighty to wield; If a Prince bee good, hee is laden with labour; if evill, with infamy, howsoever with perills, and tossed with strong and sturdy tempests, so that to bee freed from these feares, is to bee esteemed a gayne, rather then a losse. Examples to prove this, are those of our owne Country, (without seeking of others) as may appeare by <hi>Kini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellus, Ina, Ceonulphe, Eadbertus, Etheldredus, Kenredus, Offa, Sebba,</hi> and <hi>Sigibertus,</hi> who of their owne accord, layd downe their Diadems, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke themselues to private and solitarie lives; Many Princes have held their estate with better fortune, but none with greater honour did leave it, others have either abandoned their Rule for ease, or to avoyd danger, or upon some pretended devotion, but you for loue to your Countrie, may seeme to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to seeke your remedy, to maintaine warre, wherein much blood may be spilt, and the Realme deprived of many able Warriours, let others bee perswaded to forsake their Kingdomes, when they had no longer pleasure to hold them: But your prayse will bee for giving over, when it is to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test benefit of the people, and the more hope you have to prevaile, if you list to contend; The greater commendations will it bee to yeeld, as rather being voluntary then compulsive. The King commended the courage of the first, but this last counsell agreed best with his faint spirit, which was more inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to feare, then forward in hope, preferring abject and base safetie, before hazard with honour; Others thereupon earnestly assevered, That all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of yeelding, were both dishonourable and dangerous; That in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties noble spirits will not suddenly give off, but labour couragiously to repell the danger, or wisely to decline it, alleaging that none should so little esteem honour, as without battaile or blowe stricken, to be crestfalne, and stoope to miserable mercy; Others passionately sayd, if the honour of your noble

house nothing move you, yet let danger, and despaire arme you with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, neither the Duke nor his adherents dare bee so confident, to thinke themselves safe, so long as you shall remaine (though in private state) alive, you may assure your selfe, faire words will be given, and large offers made, but the performance rests in the curtesie of the Conquerour: and nothing ought to be thought unlawfull to him, that hath power. King <hi>Edward</hi> the second, one of your Progenitors, could not be endured by his owne Sonne: many have used violence to themselves, rather then to fall into the power of their <hi>Corrivalls,</hi> expect not then better fortune, then others have found, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bee perswaded that a Prince may live safely (if knowne) in a private estate, betwixt <hi>Caesar</hi> and nothing, the highest honour, and the deadliest downfall, there is no meane: omit not therefore all, or any meanes unassayd, to maintaine your partie by armes, you can but dye if vanquished, and dye you shall if you yeeld, but by the one you shall end your life with glory, by the other with perpetuall reproch; And though now you equally esteeme of both, yet when you shall bee pent in prison, daily in feare, expecting the deadly messenger, you will finde a difference in death, and the weaknesse of that counsell, you are now about to follow. But the Kings eares were stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped against all impression of valour, and being unable to governe himselfe in prosperitie, hee was lesse sufficient to wind himselfe out of this labyrinth of troubles; And being so beset, that hee could neither escape, nor stand out, hee desired conference with the Archbishop and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the one hee had formerly banished, the other proclaymed Traytour. These came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but perceiving by little conference, how much they were bent against him, hee demanded not what he saw no likelihood to obtaine, and agreed to relinquish his estate, to have a competency of meanes, and the lives of but eight such persons as he should nominate allowed unto him. This was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and faithfully promised by them, and afterward ratified by the Duke. The King desireth conference with the Duke, which likewise was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and so they departing, the King removed to <hi>Flynt</hi> Castle, about eight miles from <hi>Chester,</hi> whither the Duke came, at whose enterview, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and words of both were observed; The King seemed abject, the Duke neither insulting nor relenting, but rather comforting and promising friendly. The King repeated many benefits and curtesies that he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewed; That hee had spared the Dukes owne life, and now his Sonnes, in recompence whereof, he with such submisnesse (as agreed rather with necessitie then honour) desired the Duke to shew pittie to him from whom hee had received favour, and to permit him to live, with the allowance of some fitting, but private estate of maintenance. The Duke to comfort him, gave him assurance to provide for his safetie; For which hee was contented to receive thankes as for a benefit; The King from that time was kept safe, and sure enough from hindering the Dukes projects; Neither could it so easily have beene discerned, what had beene best for him to doe, as that this which hee did, was the very worst; For the same night hee was brought to <hi>Chester,</hi> and from thence secretly conveyed to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> there to remaine untill the Parliament, which was appointed should be shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter holden at <hi>Westminster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King yeelded himselfe the twentieth day of <hi>August,</hi> being the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie seventh day after the Dukes arrivall, so that considering his journeyes from <hi>Holdernesse</hi> in the North to <hi>London,</hi> from thence to <hi>Bristoll,</hi> and so into <hi>Wales,</hi> and backe againe to <hi>Chester<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> A man shall not more easily tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile over it, then hee conquered it, so propitious were his starres unto him,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7754:26"/>
that hee either found, or made a ready passage through all hinderances and obstacles; And it seemed hee only needed to open his armes, and Fortune would flye into his bosome. All the Kings Treasure and jewells, with his horse and fardage came to the Dukes hands; And many that were of his company, were dispoyled by the souldiers of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi> Some Writers barely upon conjectures affirme, that the King did not yeeld himselfe, but was surprised, passing from <hi>Flynt</hi> to <hi>Chester;</hi> But the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of such as lived at that time, and either saw it, or had perfect intelligence of these affaires, such as for their place could not but know, and for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession would not but deliver the very truth, so prevailed with Sir <hi>Iohn Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> the Penner of this History, that he followed their report. As the King was in his journey towards <hi>London,</hi> some had conspired to lye in ambush by the way, to have slaine him; But the Maior of <hi>London</hi> upon intelligence thereof, prevented the practise, and went in person, and with convenient power brought him to the Tower. Shortly after the Duke came to <hi>London</hi> in solemne estate, and sent forth summons in the Kings name, for a Parliament to bee holden the last day of September in the same yeare; In the meane <note place="margin">A Parliament summoned by the Duke in the Kings name.</note> time hee consulted with his deare friends, and neere kindred, for order to bee taken in his proceedings. The Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> who but a little before, had been Governor of the Realme for the King, was now the Dukes chiefe director, he thought it best that King <hi>Richard</hi> should both voluntarily resigne, and also solemnly bee deposed, by consent of all the States of the Realme. For resignation would bee imputed only to feare, deprivation to force, whereof the one is alwayes pitied, and the other envied. But if both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, and his desire be combined with his desert, being willing to forsake that, which hee is adjudged worthy to forgoe; Then it will appeare, that he is neither expelled his kingdome by meere constraint, nor leaveth it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out just cause; this advise generally pleased. And for execution thereof, upon the Feast of Saint <hi>Michael</hi> (which was the day before the Parliament should begin) there assembled at the Tower, <hi>Thomas Arundell</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury; Richard Scroope,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Yorke; Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hereford, Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster, Henry</hi> Earle of <hi>Northumberland, Radulph</hi> Earle of <hi>Westmerland,</hi> Lord <hi>Hugh Burnell,</hi> Lord <hi>Thomas Berckley,</hi> Lord <hi>Rosse,</hi> Lord <hi>Willowbigh,</hi> Lord of <hi>Abergany,</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Westminster,</hi> the Pryor of <hi>Canterbury, William Thirmings,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Markham</hi> chiefe Iustices, <hi>Thomas Stokey</hi> and <hi>Burbacke</hi> Doctors of the Law, <hi>Thomas Herpingham Thomas Gray,</hi> Knights; <hi>William Ferly,</hi> and <hi>Dionise Lophane</hi> Notary pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and divers others neither noted nor remembred; When all were set in their places, King <hi>Richard</hi> was brought forth, apparelled in a royall Roabe, the Diadem on his head, and his Scepter in his hand, and was placed amongst them in a chaire of State; never was Prince so gorgeous with lesse glory and more griefe; To whom it was not thought disgrace sufficient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to lose both the honour and ornaments of a King; But hee must openly to his greater scorne, renownce the one, and surrender up the other. After hee had sate a while and pawsed, he used these words to the assembly;</p>
            <p>I perswade my selfe, that some here present, and many more hereafter, <note place="margin">King <hi>Richards</hi> speech.</note> will account my case lamentable, ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>her that I have deserved this dejection; if it be just, or if it bee wrongfull, that I could not avoyd it; I confesse with shame and griefe, that many times I have appeared, both lesse provident, and lesse painfull for the benefit of the republicke, then I should or might, or would have beene hereafter, and have in many actions, more respected the satisfying my owne particular humour, then either in justice, to some private

persons, or the common good of all, yet did I not at any time, either altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther omit dutie, or commit grievance, upon supine dulnesse, or set malice, but partly by abuse of corrupt Counsellors, chiefely by error of my youthfull rash conceit without true judgement. The remembrance of these oversights, are to no man so unpleasant, as to my selfe; and the rather, because I have no meanes left, either by injuries done, or to testifie to the world, my reformed affections, which experience and maturitie of yeares, had already begun to correct, and would, I assure my selfe, have growne to a more perfect frame, if but permitted to have continued; But whether all imputed to mee be true, either in substance or qualitie, according as they are suggested, or whether being true, they be so exorbitant, as to enforce these extremities, or whether any other Prince, especially in youthfull blood, and in the space of two and twenty yeares (the time of my unfortunate raigne) doth not sometimes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for advantage or displeasure, in as deepe manner grieve some particular subject, I will notnow examine: it bootes not to use defence, nor much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth to make complaint, there is left no place for the one, nor pitie for the other; And therefore I refer all to Gods pleasure, and your more collected considerations; I accuse no man, I blame not fortune, I complaine of nothing. There is no pleasure in such ayrie comforts; it may bee if I had had will to have stood upon termes, I could have procured great favours abroad, and (presume) some good friends at home, who would have beene ready, it may be, too forward on my behalfe, to set up a dangerous and doubtfull war: But I estimate not worldly dignitie at so high a rate, to hazard the spilling of so much Christian blood, and the spoyling of so flourishing a Country, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by might have beene occasioned in my quarrell. Therefore that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth may rather rise by my fall, then I stand by the ruine thereof, I willingly submit to your desires, and am here come to dispossesse my selfe of all Regall and publike authoritie or title; And to make it free and lawfull for you to Elect, and Create for your King, <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> my Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles son, whom I know to be as worthy to take that place, as I see you willing to conferre it upon him. Then hee read openly and distinctly, the forme of his cession, wherein hee did declare that he had discharged his Subjects from their obligations of Fealtie and homage, and all other tyes whatsoever; And of his owne will and free motion, did repudiate the title, dignitie, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a King, and rendred up the possession of the Realme, with the use and title thereof, and all the rites thereunto appertaining; and thereunto sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, and made oath for the performance; And then with his owne hands delivered the Crowne, Scepter, Roabe, and ornaments to the Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi> saying, Cousin I wish you more happinesse herewith, then ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to my selfe; Then did hee Constitute the Archbishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Hereford</hi> his Procurators, to intimate and declare this his resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all the States of the Parliament. Lastly, hee gave all his Treasure to the summe of three hundred thousand pounds in coine, besides his jewels and Plate for satisfaction of injuries done, desiring the Duke and those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, severally by their names, not altogether to forget that hee had been their King, nor yet too much to thinke upon it; but to retaine a moderate remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him, and in recompence of the ease hee had done them by this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary resignation, to permit him to live safely, in a private life: with the contemplation whereof he was so taken, that from thenceforth hee would preferre it before any worldly preferment. This was done with voice and countenance so consonant to his present passion, that not any present not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of humane instabilitie, which was not in some measure moved
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7754:27"/>
thereat, insomuch that some few teares secretly dropped from many eyes there present, in whose thoughts a confused, but obscure alteration already began to take rising; so prone is man-kinde to pitie misery, though by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves procured, and to envie prosperitie, even in those themselves have raised. The Munday following the Parliament began at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and there the Archbishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Hereford</hi> (the late Kings Attorneys for this purpose) openly declared to the States (there assembled) the Kings voluntary resignation; and demanded whether they would assent and agree thereunto. The Barons of the Realme, by particular assent, the Commons with generall voice, accepted and admitted the fame; Then it was thought requisite, that some defects and misdemeanours in point of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, should bee objected against the late King, for which hee might bee adjudged, as unworthy, as hee seemed unwilling to retaine the Soveraigntie, whereupon certaine Articles were ingrossed and publikely read, in which was contained how unprofitable he had beene to the Realme, how unjust and grievous to the Subjects, repugnant both to his oath and honour.</p>
            <p>The principall of which Articles were: 1. That hee had wastfully spent the Treasure of the Kealme, and had to unworthy persons given the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Crowne, by reason whereof many great and grievous taxes were daily layd upon the Commons.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That whereas divers Lords, aswell spirituall as temporall, were by the high Court of Parliament, appointed to treate of matters concerning the State of the Kingdome, they being busied about the same Commission, hee with others of his accomplices, went about to appeach them of high Treason.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That by force and threats hee enforced the Iudges of the Realme at <hi>Shrowsbury,</hi> to condiscend to his way, for the destruction of the said Lords; That thereupon hee raised warre against <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster, Thomas</hi> Earle of <hi>Arundell, Richard</hi> Earle of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> and others, contrary to his promise in derogation of the honour of the King. That hee caused his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers owne brother, the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> without law to be attached and sent to <hi>Callice,</hi> and there without reason secretly murthered; That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Earle of <hi>Arundell</hi> at his arraignment, pleaded his Charter of pardon, hee could not bee heard, but was shamefully and suddenly put to death. That hee assembled certain Lancashire and Cheshire men, to make warre upon the foresaid Lords, and suffered them to robbe and spoyle, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reproofe or prohibition.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That though hee dissembled, and had made Proclamation; That the Lords were not attached for any crime of Treason, but for oppression done within the Realme, yet hee objected against them in the Parliament, treason and rebellion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That notwithstanding his Pardon granted to them, hee enforced di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Lords partakers, to bee againe intollerably fined, to their utter undoing.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That contrary to his promise in Parliament, hee to his great dishonour kept away divers Rowles and Records, which by agreement should have beene showne to certaine Commissioners, appointed to treate of the affaires of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That hee commanded that no man upon paine of death, should entreat for the returne of <hi>Henry</hi> now Duke of <hi>Lancaster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. That whereas the Realme is immediately holden of God, he after he <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lancasters</hi> ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie conquest.</note> had obtained in Parliament divers Acts for his owne particular ends, procured
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7754:27"/>
Bulls and heavy censures from <hi>Rome,</hi> to compell his Subjects, under heavy censures from <hi>Rome,</hi> to observe and performe them contrary to the Honour and antient priviledge of this kingdome.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That though the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> had done his devoyre against the Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> in defence of his quarrell, yet hee banished him the land without showing just cause: contrarie to equitie and the law of Armes.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That having under the great Seale given leave to the said Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> to make Proxies and Attornies to prosecute and defend his causes, The said King after the Dukes departure, would not permit any to appeare for him.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That hee had put out divers high Sheriffes, having beene lawfully ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, putting into their roomes, some of his Favourites, subverting the course of the law, contrary to his oath and honour.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Hee borrowed great summes, and bound himselfe for repayment, but no peny thereof payed.</p>
            <p n="13">13. That hee layd taxations upon his Subjects at his pleasure, consuming the Treasure in idle expences, but not paying the poore subject for his owne viands.</p>
            <p n="14">14. That hee affirmed all the Law lay in his head and brest, by which phreneticall conceit, divers of the Nobilitie were destroyed, and the poore Commons fleeced.</p>
            <p n="15">15. That hee procured by his Solicitors in the Parliament, an Act to bee established, that no Act of Parliament should bee more prejudiciall to him, then it was to his Predecessors; through which proviso, hee did what he list, and not what the law did allow.</p>
            <p n="16">16. That for his ends, hee would keep Sheriffes of shires, longer then two or one yeare in the office.</p>
            <p n="17">17. That hee put out divers Knights and Burgesses legally elected, and put others of his owne choice in their roomes, to serve his owne turne.</p>
            <p n="18">18. That hee had spies and informers in every Countrey, to heare and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, the words and demeanours of the people; And if any reproved his loose and licentious courses, they were convented, and grievously fined.</p>
            <p n="19">19. The spiritualitie objected against him, that at his going into <hi>Ireland,</hi> hee squeesed out many summes of money, besides jewels and Plate, without Law or Custome, contrary to his oath at his Coronation; That divers Lords and Iustices, being sworne to speake the truth in divers things concerning the honour and safetie of the Realme, and profit of the King; hee did so threaten them, that no man would, or durst deliver the truth.</p>
            <p n="20">20. That without the assent of the Peeres, hee carried the Iewels and Plate of this Kingdome into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the great impoverishing of the Realme, many of them being there lost.</p>
            <p n="21">21. That hee caused all remembrances of the great exactions and extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by him used, and safely deposited amongst the Parliamentary Records to bee privily imbeazeled and carried away.</p>
            <p n="22">22. That in all his Letters to the Pope, and other Princes, his stile was cunning and obscure, that neither they, nor his owne Subjects, were certaine of his true meaning.</p>
            <p n="23">23. That hee forgetfully affirmed, that all the lives of his Subjects were in his hands, to dispose at his pleasure.</p>
            <p n="24">24. That hee contrary to the great Charter of <hi>England,</hi> procured divers able men, to appeale aged people, upon matters determinable at Common law, in the Marshalls Court, because in that Court, there is no tryall but by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7754:28"/>
battaile, whereby such Appealers, knowing their insufficiencie, submitted themselves to his mercie, whom he at his pleasure unreasonably fined.</p>
            <p n="25">25. That hee devised strange formes of oathes, contrary to law, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced divers his subjects to take and observe the same, and to that end, bound them by Recognizance, to the great hinderance of many poore men, and the dishonour of God.</p>
            <p n="26">26. That where the Chancelour, upon good grounds denyed a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to a certaine person moving for the same, yet hee granted it to the same persons, under the privie Seale, with a grievous paine if not obeyed.</p>
            <p n="27">27. That hee banished the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> without just cause, or judgement, and kept him with armed men in the Parliament Chamber.</p>
            <p n="28">28. That hee granted all his goods to his successors conditionally, that he should maintaine all the Statutes made <hi>Anno</hi> 21. at <hi>Shrousbury,</hi> and the 22. yeare of his Raigne at <hi>Coventrie.</hi>
            </p>

To discourse either of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, or certaintie of these Prophesies I presume not, but this is observed many of them faile, or are fulfilled in another sense, then as they are ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceived and taken. During the time of this Kings raigne, execution by fire was first put in practise within this Realme for Controversies in point of religion: in any other matter hee did make the Church as much Champane, as show himselfe Champion of the Church; But afterwards his successors were entituled Defenders of the Faith: And how in action the first receiver of that Title did verifie the same, I referre to the report of those times. Vpon mature consideration it was found, that the title derived from <hi>Edmond</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Crouchbacke to <hi>Henry,</hi> would upon examination appeare, but a jeere, for that the said <hi>Edmond</hi> was neither eldest Sonne to <hi>Henry</hi> the third, nor yet a deformed person, but a proper Gentleman, and a brave Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7754:29"/>
in the field, and so respected of his Father, that hee gave him both the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage and honours of <hi>Simon Mumford,</hi> Earle of <hi>Leicester,</hi> of <hi>Ferrare,</hi> Earle of <hi>Darby:</hi> and of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baron of <hi>Monmoth,</hi> who to their owne ruine had displayed seditious ensignes against the King, under which <hi>Leicester</hi> was slaine at the battaile of <hi>Euesham,</hi> and to engratiate him to <hi>Blaunch,</hi> the Queene of <hi>Navarre,</hi> hee first Created him Earle of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and gave unto him the Countie, Castle and towne of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> with the Forrests of <hi>Wiresdale, Lonsdale, Newcastle</hi> beneath the <hi>Linne,</hi> the Mannor, Castle, and Forrests of <hi>Pickering,</hi> the Mannor of <hi>Scalby,</hi> the Towne of <hi>Glocester,</hi> of <hi>Huntingdon, &amp;c.</hi> and made him high Steward of <hi>England,</hi> with many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and other titles of Honour; Therefore King <hi>Henry</hi> upon the day of his Coronation, caused to bee Proclaimed, that hee claimed the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> first by right of Conquest; Secondly, because King <hi>Richard</hi> had resigned his estate, and designed him for his Successor. Lastly, because he was of the blood royall, and next heire male to King <hi>Richard, Haeres malus</hi> indeed cryed <hi>Edmond Mortimer</hi> Earle of <hi>March,</hi> to some of his familiars, and so is a Pirat to a Merchant, when hee dispoyleth him of all that ever hee hath. This <hi>Edmond</hi> Earle of <hi>March,</hi> was Sonne to <hi>Roger</hi> not long before slaine in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and had beene publickly declared heire to the Crowne, in case King <hi>Richard</hi> should have died without issue, as descended by his Mother <hi>Philip,</hi> from <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> who was elder Brother to <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> King <hi>Henryes</hi> Father, and therefore the said <hi>Edmond</hi> thought himselfe, (as in truth he was) neerer heire Male to succession of the Crowne; Then hee that by colour of right clayming it, carried it by dint of force. But the condition of the time was such, that hee supposed it was in vaine for him to stirre, where King <hi>Richard</hi> could not stand; whereupon he dissembled, either that hee saw his wrong, or that hee regarded it, and chose rather to suppresse his Title for a time, then by untimely opposing himselfe to have it oppressed, and depressed for ever: he withdrew himselfe therefore from <hi>London,</hi> to his Lordship of <hi>Wigmore</hi> in the West parts of this Realme, and there settled himselfe, to a quiet and retired life, hee counted it a point of wisdome to meddle with nothing, whereof any man was chargeable to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der account: in revenewes he was not great, in apparell moderate, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and traine not excessive (yet in all these honourable and according to his degree) so that they that esteemed men by the outward apparance only, could see in him no great show of witte, or courage to be feared, or of wealth or honour, in his estate to bee envied; And thus whilst that a greater enemie was feared, hee passed unregarded, making himselfe safe by contempt, where nothing was so dangerous as popular opinion, and raked up those coles in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie for a time, which afterward set all the Realme on fire, King <hi>Richard</hi> being now deposed, was sent after his resignation to <hi>Leeds</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to <hi>Pomfret</hi> Castle, where wee leave him.</p>

to the Subjects, yea hurtfull, yea untolerable; yet can they neither ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his power, nor harme his Person, either by judiciall proceedings, or by force; for neither one nor all Magistrates have any authoritie over the Prince, from whom all Authoritie is derived, and whose only presence doth silence and suspend all inferiour jurisdiction and force. And for power, what subject can assist or counsell, or conceale, violence against his Prince, and not incur the high &amp; heinous crime offensonry or treason, it is a common saying, <hi>thought is free,</hi> free indeed from punishment of secular Laws, except byword or deed, it break forth into action, yet the secret thoughts against the sacred Majestie of a Prince, without attempt, without endeavour, have bin adjudged to death; And somewho in auricular confession, have discovered their treacherous devises a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King in person, have for the same bin executed. All laws do exempt a madd man from punishment, because their actions are not governed by their will, and the will of man being set apart, all his deeds are indifferent, neither can the body offend without a corrupt or erronious minde, yet if a mad man but draw his weapon upon his King, it hath beene adjudged worthy death. And lest any man should surmise that Princes, for the maintenance of their owne safetie, and soveraigntie, are the only authors of these judgements; Let us examine with consideration, the patternes and precepts, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose set forth in the Sacred text, <hi>Nabucadonezer</hi> King of <hi>Assyria</hi> wasted all <hi>Palestine</hi> with fire and sword, oppugned the holy Citie a great while, and at the last expugned it, slaughtered the King, burnt the Temple, carryed away the holy Vessells and Treasure, and permitted the souldiers with unmercifull crueltie to spoile and ransacke all the people with fire and sword, and whom from thence had escaped, and the pestilence had spared, hee led captive into <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and there erected his golden Image, commanding those that refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to worship it, to bee cast into the fiery Furnace, notwithstanding God calleth <hi>Nabucadnezer</hi> his servant, and promiseth him wages for his service; And the Prophets <hi>Ieremiah</hi> and <hi>Baruke</hi> did write unto the <hi>Iewes</hi> to pray for the life of him and of <hi>Balthazar</hi> his sonne, that their dayes upon earth might bee as the dayes of heaven, and <hi>Ezechiel</hi> with bitter termes upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the disloyaltie of <hi>Zedechiah,</hi> for revolting from <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> after homage done unto him; did not <hi>Saul</hi> put all the Priests to death, because one of them did relieve holy and harmlesse <hi>David?</hi> did hee not prosecute his faithfull servant, and dutifull son-in-law, yet was not hee spared, nay prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by him? And was not <hi>David</hi> much grieved for but taking away the lap of his garment, and afterwards caused the messenger to bee slaine, that upon request, and for pitie did lend his hand (as himselfe reported) to hasten the voluntary death of that sacred King? As for the contrary examples of <hi>Iehu,</hi> They were done by expresse Oracle, and revelation from God, and are no more set downe for our imitation, then the robbing the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or any other particular or priviledged commandement, but in the generall precept, which all men must ordinarily follow, not only our actions, but our speeches also, and our very thoughts are strictly charged, with dutie and obedience to Princes, whether they bee good or evill.

And therefore Christ told <hi>Pilat,</hi> That the power which hee had was given him from above; And the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> called <hi>Cyrus</hi> being a prophane and heathen Prince, the Lords annointed: For God turneth the hearts even of wicked Princes to doe his will; And as <hi>Iehosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> said to his Rulers, they execute not the judgement of man, but of the Lord: In regard whereof <hi>David</hi> calleth them gods, because they have the rule and authoritie even from God, which if they doe abuse, they are not to bee adjudged by their subjects, for no power within their Dominion is supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to theirs; But God reserveth them to their sorest triall, <hi>horribly and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly</hi> (saith the Wise man) <hi>will the Lord appeare to them, and a hard judgement shall they have.</hi> The law of God commandeth, that the childe <note place="margin">Sap. 6.</note> should not bee put to death, for any contumelie done unto the Parents, but what if the father be a robber? if a murtherer? if for excesse of villanies, odious and execrable both to God and man? surely hee deserveth the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test degree of punishment, and yet must not the sonne lift up his hand against him, for no offence can bee so great to bee punished by parricide; But our Country is (or ought to bee) more deere to us then our Parents; And the Prince is the father of the country, and therefore more sacred and deare to us then our Parents by nature, and must not bee violated, how imperious, how impious soever hee bee: doth hee command or demand our purses or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons? we must not shun from the one, nor shrinke from the other, for as <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> saith, Kings have dominion over the cattell of their subjects at their pleasure; Doth hee injoyne those actions, which are contrary to the lawes of God, wee must neither wholly obey, nor violently resist, but with a constant courage, submit our selves to all manner of punishment, and show our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, by suffering and not performing; yea the Church hath declared it to bee an heresie, to hold that a Prince may be slaine, or deposed by his Subjects, for any default or disorder of life, or default in government. There will bee faults so long as there bee men, and as wee endure with patience, a barren yeare, if it happen, and unseasonable weather, so must wee tolerate the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of Rulers, and quietly expect either reformation or alteration. But alas! what such cruelty, what such impietie, hath King <hi>Richard</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? examine the imputations objected, with the false circumstance of ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation, and you shall finde but little of truth, or of great moment, it may be many oversights have escaped (as who lives without offending) yet none so grievous to bee termed tyrannie, as proceeding rather from unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ignorance, or corrupt counsell, then from any naturall or wilfull malice; Oh! how should the world bee pestered with tyrants, if Subjects might be permitted to rebell upon pretence of tyrannie? how many good Princes should often bee suppressed by those by whom they ought to be supported? if they but levie a Subsidie, or any other taxation, it shall bee judged oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they put any to death for traiterous attempts against their persons, it shall bee exclaimed at for crueltie; if they shall doe any thing against the good liking of their people, it shall bee proclaimed tiranny.</p>
            <p>But let it bee that without desert in him, or authoritie in us, King <hi>Richard</hi> must bee deposed, yet what right hath the duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> to the Crown? or what reason have wee, without right to give it him? If hee make Title as heire to King <hi>Richard,</hi> then must hee stay King <hi>Richards</hi> death; for no man can succeed as heire to the living; But its well knowne to all men, who are not wilfully blinde, or grosly ignorant: that, there are some yet alive, lineal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly descended from <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> whose issue by the judgement
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7754:32"/>
of the high Court of Parliament, in the eighth yeare of King <hi>Richards</hi> raigne, was declared heire apparant to the Crowne in case of <hi>Richard</hi> should die <note place="margin">Ann. 1399 R. 2.</note> without issue. The claime from <hi>Edmond Crouchbacke,</hi> I passe over the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors thereof, themselves being ashamed of so absurd an abuse; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the pretence now on foot, is by right of conquest, and the Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation and grant, and the consent of the many: it is bad stuffe that will take no colour, what conquest can a subject make against a Soveraigne, where the warre is insurrection, and the victory high treason; King <hi>Richards</hi> resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being in prison, is an act of exaction by force, and therefore of no force to bind him; And by the lawes of this realme, the King by himselfe cannot alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, the antient jewells, and ornaments of the Crowne, much lesse give away his Crowne and Kingdome. And custome wee have none, for the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar to elect their King, but they are alwayes tyde to accept of him, whom the right of succession enables to the Crowne, much lesse can they make good that Title, which is by violence usurped; For nothing can bee said to bee free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, when libertie is restrained by feare; As for the deposing of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, it is no more to bee urged, then the poisoning of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> or the murdering of a lawfull Prince: wee must live according to lawes, not examples, yet the kingdome then was not taken from lawfull successors; But if wee looke backe to times past, wee shall finde that these Titles, were more strong in King <hi>Stephen,</hi> then they are now in the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> for King <hi>Henry</hi> the first being at libertie, neither restrained, nor constrained, the people assented to this designement, and thereupon without feare or force he was annointed, and crowned King. Yet <hi>Henry Fitzempresse,</hi> having a neerer right to the Crowne by his Mother (notwithstanding his Father was a stranger, and hee borne beyond the Seas) never ceased the prosecution of bloody warres, to the great effusion of blood, and spoyling the Countrey, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till his lawfull inheritance was assured him; It terrifieth mee but to thinke, how many flourishing kingdomes have beene by such contentions, either rent by intestine division, or subdued to forraine Princes, under pretence of assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and aide. This Kingdome hath had too wofull experience of these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall mischieves, and yet neither examples of other Countries, or miseries of our owne, are sufficient to make us bee wary; Certainly I feare, it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide us, as it did to <hi>Esops</hi> Frogges, who being desirous to have a King, had a beame given them, the first fall whereof affrighted them, but when they saw it lie still, they contemptuously insulted thereon, and desired a King of more active spirit; Then a Storcke was sent them, which stalking amongst them daily devoured them. King <hi>Richards</hi> mildnesse hath bred in us this scorne, interpreting it to bee cowardise and dulnesse of nature; I dare not say (yet give mee leave to suspect) with greater courage, wee may finde greater crueltie. And thus have I declared my opinion, with more words, you may perhaps conjecture then wisdome, yet fewer then the waight of the cause doth require, and I doe resolutely conclude, that wee have neither power, nor pollicie, either to Depose King <hi>Richard,</hi> or in his place to Elect Duke <hi>Henry;</hi> That King <hi>Richard</hi> remaineth still our Soveraigne Lord, and therefore it is not lawfull for us to give judgement against him. That the Duke whom you are pleased to stile King, hath more transgressed the King and Realme, then <hi>Richard</hi> hath done either against him or us; For hee being banished the Realme for tenne yeares by the King and Councell (amongst whom his owne Father was chiefe) and given oath not to returne without speciall licence; Hee hath not only broken his oath, but disturbed the peace of the Land, dispossessed the King of his Royall estate, and now demandeth
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7754:32"/>
judgement against his person, without offence proved, or defence heard; if this perjurie, and this injury move not, yet let both our private and publike dangers somewhat withdrawe us from these violent proceedings.</p>
            <p>This speech was diversly taken, as mens affections were diversly hurried, betwixt hope, feare, and shame, but the most part did seeme to stand for Duke <hi>Henry;</hi> Whereupon the Bishop was attached by the Earle Marshall, <note place="margin">The Bishop committed.</note> and committed to the keeping of the Abbot of <hi>Westminster,</hi> but presently after to Prison in the Abby of Saint <hi>Albones;</hi> His Counsell and conjecture then contemned, was after approved of (when too late) both in the Kings time, during whose raigne, no yeare passed without slaughter and executions, but more in the time succeeding, when within the space of thirty sixe yeares twelve set battells upon this quarrell were fought within the Realme by natives only, and above fourescore Princes of the blood Royall, fell by each others sword.</p>
            <p>It was concluded notwithstanding what the Bishop had spoken, that King <hi>Richard</hi> should bee kept in a large Prison, with all manner of Princely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; And if any should attempt to rere warre for his deliverance, that hee should bee the first man should suffer for that attempt. The Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of the eleventh yeare of King <hi>Richard</hi> were revived, and those of the one and twentieth wholly repealed, and all in that Parliament attainted, were restored to their Titles and inheritances, without suing livery; And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to such goods whereof the King had not beene answered, except the rents and issues of their lands.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> is delivered out of prison, and the Earle of <hi>Arundels</hi> sonne restored to his inheritance, others also that stood ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, or were in prison, recovered their libertie and estate; it was enacted, that none that came with <hi>Henry</hi> against <hi>Richard,</hi> should bee impeached or troubled. To the Earle of <hi>Westmerland</hi> the King gave the Countie of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> to the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> the <hi>Isle of Man,</hi> to hold of him by the service of bearing the Sword, wherewith hee entred into this Kingdome before him. Divers others his followers hee advanced to places of highest note, some for desert, but most to win their favour, and perhaps projecting a plot for partakers, if times should change; For in many actions, men take more care to prevent revenge, then to lead an innocent life.</p>
            <p>It is likewise ordered, that the plotters and procurers of the Duke of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesters</hi> murther should bee strictly enquired after, and severely punished. And judgement was given against the Appellants of the Earles of <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Arundel,</hi> and that the Dukes of <hi>Aumerles, Sussex,</hi> and <hi>Exceter,</hi> the Marquesse <hi>Dorset,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Glocester,</hi> who were there present, should lose their Titles of Honour, and forfeit their estate in all the lands, <note place="margin">Nobles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded of then Titles.</note> they had which was formerly belonging to the Appellees, and that all their Letters patents concerning the same, should bee surrendred into the Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to bee cancelled; and for their owne inheritance to bee at the mercy of the King. That they should give no Liveries to retainers, nor keepe more then should bee necessary; That if any of them did adhere or assist the Deposed King <hi>Richard,</hi> against the Decree of his Deposition; That they should suffer as in high treason: And for that many of the common people did murmure: That many the Officers had grievously extorted, either by connivency or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret support of the Lords, those Officers were removed, and the corruption <note place="margin">Officers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</note> purged. Then were Proclamations made, that if any man had by strong hand beene oppressed, by any of the Lords, or by any under-officers to them beene wronged or abused, his complaint proved, the delinquent should give him
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7754:33"/>
plenary recompence. The execution of these Nobles was much questioned. The importunitie of the people, and the perswasions of many great ones drew that way, but pollicie was against it, especially the opinion of <hi>Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> which seemed needfull in a new, not well settled estate. In this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Lord <hi>Fitzwater</hi> appealed the Duke of <hi>Aumerle</hi> upon points of high Treason; the like did the Lord <hi>Morley</hi> to the Earle of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and above twentie Appellants more gaged battell, but the King purposing to lay the foundation of his government by favour, and not by force, gave pardon and restitution alike to all, upon securitie for their allegiance, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately admonished, and as it were intreated the one part, that old griefes and grudges should not bee renewed, but altogether buried; The other part hee desired to bee afterwards more circumspect of their actions; and for the time past rather to forget, they ever were in fault, then to remember that they were pardoned; No punishment was inflicted on any, only the Earle of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> and the Lord <hi>Morley,</hi> who had beene in especiall grace with King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard.</hi> These two were committed, but at the intercession of their friends, they were quickly released, the rest (but especially the Duke of <hi>Aumerle,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Exceter,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Callice)</hi> hee received freely to favour, <hi>Aumerle</hi> was Cousin german to both Kings. <hi>Exceter</hi> halfe Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to King <hi>Richard,</hi> and Brother-in-law to King <hi>Henry,</hi> as having espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his Sister the Lady <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The greatest crime they could enforce against them, was their being firme to King <hi>Richard,</hi> because they did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stomacke his dejection, but stirre more then others, and assay to raise forces on his behalfe. The Dukes confessed the first accusation, affirming they were unfortunately faithfull to King <hi>Richard,</hi> but as they that are once false, prove seldome after firmely sound, so they that have approved themselves true to one Prince may bee the better trusted by another. The King did rather admit this as a defence, then remit it as a fault, affirming that such examples were not to bee misliked of Princes, and did afterwards by curtesie, and liberalitie endevour to make them firme and faithfull unto him.</p>
            <p>This fact was diversly interpreted, according to mens severall dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, some admiring the Kings moderation, others disallowing his confidence; And though these meanes have to that purpose prevailed with some, yet the common course may move us to conjecture, that there is small assurance to bee had in reconciled enemies, whose affections for the most part are like to glasse, which being once crackt, will never bee otherwise then crazed and ever unsound. During this time of Parliament held at <hi>Westminster,</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop had convoked a Synod which was held in <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, to whom the King sent the Earles of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmerland,</hi> who decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Clergie, that they were not sent to them from the King to require any moneys from them, but to acquaint them with the Kings resolution, which was to confirme all their priviledges and immunities unto them, and to joyne with them as they should desire him in the punishment of all hereticks and opposites to their religion received, for which so doing, hee craved but their supplications to God for the safetie of him and his posteritie, and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie of the kingdome, which was by all there present religiously promised. Now to palliate all prejudice and hard opinion, which other Princes might happily conceive of these his proceedings, Hee dispatched Embassadours to divers his bordering neighbours, intimating to them respectively, both by what Title, and whose favour hee had obtained the Kingdome; To <hi>Rome</hi> he sent the Bishop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Cheney</hi> Knight, and <hi>Iohn Cheney</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>squire to <hi>France,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Worcester</hi> into
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7754:33"/>
               <hi>Spaine;</hi> the Bishop of Saint <hi>Asaphs,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Par</hi> into <hi>Almaine,</hi> the <note place="margin">Ann. 1400 Reg. 2.</note> Bishop of <hi>Bangor,</hi> and others; most of these Princes (as in a matter which little concerned them, either in point of honour or hatred, seemed to take no notice of what was done, or were easily perswaded, that all was done well. But <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> was so disquieted with this dishonourable dealing, with his Son-in-law, that his passion, upon the first relation thereof, put him into his old fit of phrenzie, but recovered thereof, hee provided for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the injury; Many of the Nobilitie of <hi>France</hi> were forward, to set a foot this enterprise, but especially the Earle of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who had married King <hi>Richards</hi> halfe Sister, so that defiance is sent, and on both sides prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for warre is made; These novelties much animated the <hi>Aquitains</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the <hi>English</hi> command) some were grieved at the infamous blemish of disloyaltie, which was cast upon the Nation; others feared their being made a prey to the tyrannie of the French, against whom they had cause to suspect that <hi>England</hi> being distracted by civill factions, either would not attend, or could not bee able to beare them out; But the <hi>Burdisians</hi> were principally perplexed with King <hi>Richards</hi> wrongs, because hee was borne and bred in their Citie. The Frenchmen generally were nothing displeased at this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment of the <hi>Aquitanes,</hi> supposing that opportunitie was now offered, to regaine the possession of the Dutchy of <hi>Guian,</hi> if either power or pollicie were seasonably applied. Hereupon <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Burbon</hi> came downe <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Burbon</hi> solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Guyan</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt.</note> to <hi>Angiers,</hi> who from thence solicited the chiefe Townes of <hi>Guyan</hi> by faire speeches, and large promises, to change their allegiance, but the Lieutenant there Sir <hi>Robert Knowles</hi> withall diligence &amp; industry, laboured to suppresse the mutinous, to stay the doubtfull, to confirme the good, and to retaine all in due obedience and order. But hee prevailed very little, his armie being but weake, and the people stiffenecked; Neither did <hi>Burbon</hi> much prevaile, due consideration being had, how heavy the yoke of <hi>France</hi> was, above the subjection of the <hi>English,</hi> having beene well acquainted with the tributes, and taxes, wherewith the Frenchmen were usually taxed, who had in every Country assigned Lieutenants and Treasurers, the one to draw the blood, the other the substance of the slavish-made subjects, whose cruelty and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, laid hold without exceptions of all, the one tormenting by force, the other by law. Thus like a ship that the tyde driveth one way, and the wind another, betwixt obedience and revolt, stood the <hi>Aquitanes,</hi> they were willing enough to displease the English, but most unwilling to indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or undoe themselves by adhering to the French, upon advertisement whereof, the Earle of <hi>Worcester,</hi> with a Company of able and willing soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, is sent into <hi>Guyan,</hi> who not by unseasonable exprobrating their fault, but <note place="margin">The Earle of <hi>Worcester</hi> sent to <hi>Guyan.</hi>
               </note> by reason convincing it, partly by his wisdome and credit, and partly by his authoritie and power, so terrified the wavering multitude, that he won them to his opinion, and kept their allegeance; The graver sort with respect of dutie and faith, the rest with regard of feare and danger; Then hee tooke their oathes for obedience unto King <hi>Henry,</hi> and planted garrisons in places of import without molestation if they remained dutifull, and yet of force sufficient to keepe them under, if they should attempt to rebell, and then returned to <hi>England,</hi> there showing a faire example of moderation, in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming rather to have found then made the <hi>Aquitanes</hi> dutifull Subjects. This stirre no sooner stinted, when another more desperately dangerous did arise; For divers who had dissembled, or did repent, the furtherance they had used to the advancement of King <hi>Henry,</hi> conspired to compasse his destruction, whether for favour to King <hi>Richard</hi> (as the nature of man is to behold sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7754:34"/>
miseries with the eyes of pitie) or for envie to King <hi>Henry,</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly wee can endure excessive fortune no where so little, as in those that have beene in equall degree with our selves, or whether upon distaste recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the late Parliament, or in disdaine, to see others goe before them in the Princes favour, it is uncertaine; many sought to revenge their unjust an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with revolting.</p>
            <p>There was in those times an Abbot of <hi>Westminster</hi> that imployed his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, not as others, to cloke their idlenesse, and sloth under pretext of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, making a seeming show of sanctitie, and a solide practice of gaine and promotion, but to enable himselfe for counsell and direction in publicke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, who for the generall opinion of his wisdome and integritie, was in good credit with King <hi>Richard,</hi> and had accompanied him in his last expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into <hi>Ireland.</hi> This Abbot calling to minde a speech of King <hi>Henries,</hi> when hee was but Earle of <hi>Darby,</hi> that Princes had too little, and religious men too much, knowing the saying to be too true, for at that time the riches of the Clergie was growne so great, that they were beheld by the eyes of envy, and withall observing the generall passages in those times tended to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridging of the regular power, wherein lest <hi>Avarice</hi> should appeare open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, pollicie was pretended, and the excesse thought dangerous, both to the King and Clergie, as likely to cause want in the one, and wantonnesse in the other, and that thereupon in Parliament divers bills were formerly put up in King <hi>Richards</hi> time, to represse the increase of Religious possessions, and that inquisition, and redresse might bee had against such of the Clergie, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der licence to purchase ten pounds did purchase fortie and more <hi>per annum,</hi> and against such Ecclesiasticall persons, as caused their villanies, to marry free women inheritable, whereby their lands might come to those religious persons possession; And that it was there likewise moved, that the King should seize into his hands, all temporall livings of Religious houses, as being rather a burden, then benefit to religion. And that upon these, and such like Petitions the Archbishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> in behalfe of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of their Provinces, were often-times enforced to make their solemne protestations in Parliament; That if any thing were attempted, in restraint of the libertie of the Church, they would in no wise assent, but utterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime the same, which protestations were respectively enrolled; So that now partly upon love to King <hi>Richard,</hi> and partly upon feare, lest King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> would be as ready to invade, as he was to inveigh against the riches of the Church. This Abbot blew the first coles, and brought fewell to the fire of <note place="margin">The Abbot of <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</note> this Confederacie; Hee invited to his house, upon a solemne feast day in Michaelmasse terme, those that hee had sounded, to bee most sound to his purpose: The chiefe of which, were such as in the Parliament before had in some sortbeene touched in reputation, although by pardon and reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the harme did seeme to bee closed up: Their names were <hi>Iohn Holland</hi> Duke of <hi>Exceter, Thomas Holland</hi> his brothers sonne, Duke of <hi>Surry; Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Aumerle; Iohn Mountacute</hi> Earle of <hi>Sarum; Hugh Spencer</hi> Earle of <hi>Glocester; Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carlile,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Blunt,</hi> and <hi>Magitalon,</hi> one of King <hi>Richards</hi> Chaplaines, who in feature and favour, so resembled King <hi>Richard,</hi> that hee was afterwards affirmed to bee him indeed.</p>
            <p>After dinner they withdrew themselves into a private Chamber to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, where the Duke of <hi>Exceter</hi> (who was mainly bent to restore, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Exceters</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions to rebell.</note> the cause of his Deposed brother) declared to the rest, the alleage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they had sworne to King <hi>Richard,</hi> the honours and preferments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7754:34"/>
they were by him advanced; That they were therefore bound, both in conscience by the one, and kindnesse by the other, to take his part against all men. That King <hi>Henry</hi> contrary to both, had dispoyled him of his royall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and unjustly possessed himselfe thereof, whilst they stood looking on, and shewed neither the obedience of subjects, nor love of friends; That King <hi>Henry</hi> by violent invading, fraudulently insinuating himselfe into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his sole Soveraigne, was but a tyrant and an usurper, and such an one, as it was lawfull for any one, at any time, by any meanes, to throw downe, without respect whether hee bee good or evill; for it is lawfull for no man, under the pretence and show of goodnesse, to draw Soveraigntie to himselfe; That the examples of best governed Common-wealths, did not only permit this action, but highly honoured the actor with Statues and Garlands, and also rewarded them with titles of Nobilitie, and all the wealth of the suppressed Tyrant: and lesse hee could not esteeme King <hi>Henry,</hi> that this enterprise, would bee very profitable to the republicke, by extinguishing those warres, that the Scots menaced, the French prepared for, and the Welchmen had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begun upon this quarrell. That hee did not distrust, but it might bee accomplished by open hostilitie, but hee thought it more sure for him, and safe for the Common-wealth, to put first in practise some secret policie. And to that purpose it was proposed and approved, that a solemne justs should bee notified to bee kept at <hi>Oxford</hi> in Christmasse holy-dayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and twentie more on his part, and the Earle of <hi>Salisbury</hi> and twenty more on his part, to which King <hi>Henry</hi> should bee invited; And wen hee was therein observed to bee most intentive, hee should suddenly be surprized by such, which without suspition, might at that time bee assembled, both for number and preparation sufficient for the exploit; And thereby King <hi>Richard</hi> presently restored to libertie and State.</p>
            <p>This devise was at once uttered and approved, and so resolving on the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, they tooke a solemne oath of faith and secrecie, to the houre of death <note place="margin">The Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators plot.</note> each to other; And an Indenture Sextipartite was likewise made betwixt the Lords, wherein they bound themselves respectively each to other, to doe the best of their devoyre, for the destruction of the one, and delivery of the other King: which was interchangeably subscribed, sealed, and delivered; They likewise concluded, what forces should bee gathered, where and by whom they should bee ordered and placed, and to whose trust the execution of this exploit should bee committed.</p>
            <p>In pursuance hereof, the Duke of <hi>Exceter</hi> came to the King at <hi>Windsor,</hi> and desired that hee would vouchsafe to honour with his presence, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall exercise that was intended betwixt him and the Earle of <hi>Sarum</hi> at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford:</hi> and bee pleased to bee Iudge of their performance, if any controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie should arise. The King perswading himselfe, that that was really inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which was so formally pretended, easily yeelded to his request; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Duke with the rest of the Confederates did disperse themselves, and according to direction made their preparations, and furnished themselves with all things necessary for the accomplishment of their plot; and at the time agreed upon, addressed themselves to <hi>Oxford,</hi> well accompanied with horse and foot, where they all meet except the Duke of <hi>Aumerle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King hearing of their departure, determined the day following to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, according to promise and appointment: The Duke of <hi>Aumerles</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence gave just cause of doubt to the rest of his complices, and to bee ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the cause of his stay, they send a Post unto him, but before his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall the Duke was departed from his house towards <hi>Oxford,</hi> but by the way
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7754:35"/>
went to visit his Father, the Duke of <hi>Yorke:</hi> As they sate at dinner, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther espied a labell of one of the sextipartite Indentures hanging out of his bosome, and demanded what it was, the Sonne humbly craved pardon, and said it was nothing that any way concerned him, the young Dukes change of countenance argued some guilt, which bred some suspition in <hi>Yorke,</hi> and thereupon swore and said, By saint <hi>George</hi> but I will see it, and then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Yorkes</hi> speech to his Son.</note> upon precedent jealousie, or some present cause to doubt of some strange stratagem it is uncertaine, but hee tooke it away from him by force; The contents whereof when hee had perceived, with a fierce countenance and speech, hee said, I see Traitour that idlenesse hath made thee so mutinous, that thou playest with thy faith as children with sticks: Thou hast already once beene faithlesse to King <hi>Richard,</hi> and turnst thou false againe now to King <hi>Henrie?</hi> Thou knowest in open Parliament I became bound, body and goods for thy allegiance, and can neither thy owne duty, nor my desert, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine thee from seeking both our destructions, in faith, but I will rather help forward thine; And calling to make ready his horse, hee prepared to post to the King; It was no time now for the Duke to consult with his friends, or to consider with himselfe, what was best to bee done, but takes horse and posts towards <hi>Windsor</hi> another way, and was gotten thither before his Father, and pretending some strange and sudden occasion, causeth the gates of the Castle to be lockt: and alleaging some cause so to doe, taketh the keyes thereof with him to the King: in whose presence when he came, hee prostrates upon the <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Aumerle</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth the Conspiracy.</note> ground, beseecheth the King of mercy and forgivenesse; The King no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner demanded the offence, when hee with disturbed countenance and speech, discovered to the King all the plot, and the names of the Conspirators.</p>
            <p>The King neither seemed rashly to beleeve, nor negligently to distrust the Dukes relation, and with pollicie it stood not to entertaine the discovery, with harsh and violent termes. Therefore with gratious speeches hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted the Duke; And if this bee true said hee, wee pardon you, if feined, bee it at your perill. By this time the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> is arrived, and admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kings presence, to whom hee delivereth the Counterpane of the confederacy; which when the King had read, hee complained of the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant disposition of those men, whom neither cruelty could make firme to King <hi>Richard,</hi> nor clemency to him, but upon mislike of every present go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, were desirous of any change. Whereupon hee deferred his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and determined to attend at <hi>Windsor,</hi> what course the Conspirators would take: knowing right well, that in civill tumults, an advised patience, and opportunitie well taken, are the only weapons of advantage: and that it is an especiall point of pollicie, to make use of an adversaries oversight, in the meane time hee directs his Letters to the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> his high Constable, and the Earle of <hi>Cumberland</hi> his high Marshall, and to other his friends, of these sudden and unexpected accidents. All this time the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates hearing nothing of <hi>Aumerle,</hi> and seeing no preparation for the Kings comming, were resolved that their conspiracie was discovered, and calling to minde that once before they had beene pardoned, the guilt of this their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion excluded all hope of further mercy, whereupon they desperately resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to prosecute that by open armes, wherein their privie practises had fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; first they apparelled <hi>Magdalen</hi> in princely attire, and gave forth that he was King <hi>Richard,</hi> who by favour or negligence of his Keepers was esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out of Prison, and now implored the faith and aide of his loving subjects. Then they dispatched messengers to <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> desiring his assistance in behalfe of his Son-in-law. The common people commonly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7754:35"/>
changeable, as prone to pitie, as afore they were too forward in crueltie, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly wished the inlargement of King <hi>Richard,</hi> and wishing it, were easily drawne to beleeve it, in which imaginary conceit, the presence of <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> did strongly confirme them; And so either upon ignorance of truth, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in trouble, they joyned themselves in great troopes to the Lords, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nothing more, then to bee a meanes by which <hi>Richard</hi> might bee resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Then the Conspirators with great force, but with greater fame, as the manner is of matters unknowne, advanced forward in battaile array towards <hi>Windsor</hi> against King <hi>Henry,</hi> as against an enemy to the State, they being forty thousand strong, upon notice of their approach, the King secretly with a small traine, the next Sunday night after New-yeares-day, departed from <hi>Windsor</hi> Castle to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and the same night before day the <note place="margin">The King leaveth <hi>Windsor.</hi>
               </note> Conspirators came to the Castle, where missing their expected prey, they were divided in opinions, which way to take, some advised speedily to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to <hi>London,</hi> and not to permit him liberty to unite his forces. That Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could not properly bee called a lette, but in idle and peaceable times: that in civill dissentions nothing is so safe as speed, and advantage increaseth more by dispatching then deferring; that whilst some were in feare, some in doubt, and others suspitiously ignorant, the Citie (nay the whole Realme) might bee possessed, and that many armies whose fury at first rush, could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted, by delayes did dissipate, and wast to nothing, others that would seeme to bee, but were not, out of a dastardly disposition, perswaded rather first to set King <hi>Richard</hi> at libertie, for if their counterfeiting should bee discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, before they had really his person in possession, the people would fall from them, which would bee to their utter confusion, by their perswasion they gave over the pursuit, and retired to <hi>Colbrooke,</hi> and there delayed the time of action in deliberation, neither being couragiously quicke, nor conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately stayed, but subject to vacillation: and thereby began every day more then other to bee vilipended, decreasing both in opinion, power, and hope; The Maior of <hi>London</hi> is commanded by the King, to levie power in armes <note place="margin">The Maior of <hi>London</hi> furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth King <hi>Henry</hi> with Archers.</note> for his assistance, who presently furnished him with three thousand Archers, besides a sufficient guard left for and in the Citie. Thus assisted the King with twenty thousand able souldiers from <hi>London</hi> came to <hi>Hounslow</hi> Heath, there staying braved his enemies, and contemning their disorderly multitude, but the enemies either for feare of their Kings power, or distrust of their owne, or lingring untill their expected ayde was come out of <hi>France,</hi> refused to joyne; And it is questionable, whether they showed greater courage in setting up the danger, or cowardise in declyning it, when it was presented unto them, from thence they went to <hi>Sunning</hi> neere <hi>Reading,</hi> where Queen <hi>Isabel</hi> lay: to whom upon the plaine song aforesaid, fame had descanted, that King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Queen <hi>Isabels</hi> womanish course.</note> was at <hi>Pomfret</hi> with an hundred thousand men well appointed, and that for feare of him, King <hi>Henry</hi> with his was fled to the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> All which was as lightly beleeved, as it was idly told; Whereupon shee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced King <hi>Henries</hi> armes, and plucked away his Cognizance from those, that as his servants attended upon her, and having there with somewhat eased her swolne heart, shee with the Lords departed to <hi>Wallingford,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Abington,</hi> stirring up by the way the people, to take armes in ayde of King <hi>Richard;</hi> At length they came to <hi>Cicester,</hi> and there tooke up their lodgings. The Duke of <hi>Surry</hi> &amp; the Earle of <hi>Salisbury</hi> in one Inne, the Duke of <hi>Exceter</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Glocester</hi> in another Inne, the Army encamped <note place="margin">The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> assault the conspirators.</note> in the fields. The Bayliffe of the Towne suspecting what was true, that these guests were no good subjects, besets the house where the Duke of <hi>Surry</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:7754:36"/>
lay, who with his retinue growne desperately bold, made strong defence against the assaylants; The Duke of <hi>Exceter</hi> and his Company had not force enough to rescue their Companions; Whereupon a Priest of their consort, supposing thereby to divert the Townsmen from the assault, set divers houses on fire, but the fire more inflamed the townsmens furie, and made them insist more obstinately in the attempt, swearing not to rescue their losses, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge them, and quench the flames with the Traytors blood. The Earle of <hi>Exceter,</hi> and they that were with him, perceiving the force of the assaylants to increase, and that it was impossible for a few so to sustaine the fury of so many obstinately bent, they fled out of the backside towards the Campe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to bring the Army to the reskue; But the souldiers having heard the alarum, and seeing the fire within the Towne, supposing the King was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with his forces, were strucke with a sudden and causlesse feare, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Commanders of courage to confirme them, they disbanded and fled; and whilst every one sought to save one, they brought themselves all to confusion.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Surry</hi> and his company manfully maintained the fight, with great bloodshed on all sides, from midnight untill three of the clocke the next after-noone, and then being inferiour in number and fortune, the Duke and the Earle of <hi>Salisbury</hi> were both wounded to death and taken, and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning dying, their heads were strooke off and sent to the King to <hi>London.</hi> There were then taken prisoners, Sir <hi>Bennet Sherley,</hi> Sir <hi>Bernard Brockas,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Blount,</hi> and twenty eight Lords and men of note, who were afterwards upon King <hi>Henryes</hi> comming to <hi>Oxford</hi> sent thither unto him, and there executed. The Duke of <hi>Exceter</hi> with Sir <hi>Iohn Sherley</hi> fled into <hi>Essex,</hi> from whence many times they attempted to have escaped to <hi>France,</hi> but by contrary windes were driven backe againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then lurking in secret places, the Duke was taken and lead to <hi>Plashey,</hi> and there beheaded. There wanted not some in those times that made conjectures that now the Duke of <hi>Glocesters</hi> death, was brought to bee reckoned for, who by <hi>Exceters</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell and contrivance, in the same place had beene wrongfully apprehended. An example for those which square out their actions by the crooked line of their pleasure, or power to other mens disprofit or disparagement, but pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of such impietie, though it bee prolonged, doth never faile, but commeth at length, and then surely, though perhaps slowly. This Duke of <hi>Exceter</hi> was a man of high Parentage, great power, and honourable Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Created Earle of <hi>Huntington</hi> in the eleventh yeare of King <hi>Richard</hi> now deposed: in the one and twentieth hee was Created Duke of <hi>Exceter,</hi> and upon the resignation of the place, and release of the right thereto, by <hi>Aubery de Vere,</hi> Earle of <hi>Oxford,</hi> was made that yeare Lord Chamberlaine of <hi>England,</hi> and married <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Iohn of Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and <hi>Blaunch</hi> his wife; by whom hee had issue, <hi>Richard</hi> that dyed young, <hi>Iohn</hi> afterwards Duke of <hi>Exceter</hi> &amp; Earle of <hi>Huntington; Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> that dyed without issue, and a Daughter named <hi>Constance,</hi> first married to <hi>Thomas Mowbray,</hi> sonne and heire of <hi>Thomas Mowbray</hi> Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke,</hi> and after to <hi>Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Ruthyn,</hi> hee was popular, and openly praise-worthy, but his secret actions were hardly censured, hee was partaker of all his brothers vices, and of counsell to many of them, yet somewhat more circumspect and close, and not so much partaker of his prosperitie, as violently carried with the torrent of his misery.</p>
            <p>

            <p>The counterfeit of King <hi>Richard</hi> flying into <hi>Scotland</hi> was apprehended, committed to the Tower, and from thence drawne, and hanged, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and one <hi>Ferby,</hi> and an other of <hi>K. Rich.</hi> Chaplaines with him: divers others of all sorts, Lords and Gentlemen, with a great number of common souldiers, were in other places put to death, insomuch, that the King though otherwise of a moderate and peaceable disposition, seemed in this too too vindicative of his owne injurie, or rather in maintaining the injury that hee had done.</p>
            <p>The heads of the chiefe Conspirators were pitched upon poles, and set over <hi>London</hi> bridge, lamentable spectacles of heads and quarters of unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate dismembred wretches were visible, in many parts of this Realme, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying above ground, not all for desert, but many to satisfie either the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or want of King <hi>Henryes</hi> friends; Insomuch that some of those of dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest apprehension, openly gave forth, That in short time there would be just cause to wish King <hi>Richard</hi> againe, as being more tolerable, to indure the crueltie of one, then of many, and to live where nothing, then where any thing might bee permitted, was most safe.</p>
            <p>The Abbot of <hi>Westminster</hi> in whose house, and head this Conspiracy tooke life and light, hearing of these disasters, going from his Monastery Grange neere <hi>Westminster,</hi> was taken with a dead Palsie, and suddenly dyed speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse. And although in this enterprise, accident gave policie the checke, and by a strange fortune which wisdome could not prevent, overturned the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, yet it is apparant, that this Abbot first moved the stone, that rowling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, was likely toturne King <hi>Henry</hi> out of his Chaire. The Bishop of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile</hi> was condemned for his treason, but the extremity of his passion, closed up his dayes, and prevented the violence and shame of publicke execution. King <hi>Richard</hi> as afore having abdicated his Regalitie, did but a short time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that sweet securitie, wherewith hee so flattered himselfe; For first his goods which hee had given in satisfaction of the wrongs by him done, were shared amongst his enemies, and hee removed first to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and then from thence to the Castle of <hi>Leeds</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Pomfret,</hi> where being kept in straight Prison, innocent and ignorant of this offence, was notwithstanding made a partner in the punishment; For King <hi>Henry</hi> observing how farre the Lords might have prevailed with their late stratagem, for if their stomacks had beene but answerable to their strength, and their bold beginning, had not ended in faintnesse and sloth, they might have driven him to an hard hazard, hee caused King <hi>Richard</hi> to bee put to death, thereby to make sure, that no man should cloke open rebellion, under the colour of following sides, nor countenance his Conspiracie; either with the person or name of King <hi>Richard.</hi> But whether hee did expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his death or no, it is a question, but out of question he showed some li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and desire to the action, &amp; gave approvement thereto, when it was done.</p>
            <p>The report went that King <hi>Richard</hi> was Princely served every day, with abundance of costly dishes, but was not suffered to touch, or taste one of them, and so perished with famine; I perswade my selfe this is meerely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous, for such barbarous and unnaturall cruelty against a King, and a kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, is not likely to proceed from King <hi>Henry</hi> a Christian; But it is more
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7754:37"/>
probable which a Writer about those times affirmeth, That King <hi>Henry</hi> sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at his Table sad and pensive, after a deepe sigh, said, Have I never a faithfull friend, that will ridde me of him, whose life will breed destruction to mee, and disquiet to the Realme, and whose death will bee a meanes of safetie, and quiet to both? And how can I be freed from feare, so long as the cause of my danger doth continue? what securitie, what hope shall we have of peace, unlesse the roote of rebellion bee plucked up? A Knight called Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> of <hi>Exton</hi> hearing this, with eight of his followers posteth to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fret,</hi> and pretending warrant from the King, had entrance into the Castle, where hee commanded the Esquire who sued to King <hi>Richard</hi> to surcease his service, whereupon when King <hi>Richard</hi> being set at Table, saw that hee was not served as afore with assay, and demanded of the Esquire the reason of this his neglect of dutie therein; Hee was answered, that Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> had brought such order from King <hi>Henry,</hi> comming lately from the Court; <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> moved with this act, and answer said, The divell take thee, and <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster;</hi> with that Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> with his Retinew before him, entred into the Chamber, and locked the dore after them; Whereupon King <hi>Richard</hi> spying their drift, and suspecting his owne danger, stepped couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to the first man and wresting the Halbert out of his hands, therewith slew foure of his mischievous assaylants, and with admirable resolution fought with the other untill comming by the Chayre wherein the King used to sit, in which the cowardly Knight himselfe was got for his owne safetie, he was by him strucken with a Pollax on the hinder part of the head, who being at the point of death, groned forth these words, <hi>Edward</hi> the second my great Grandfather, was in this manner Deposed, imprisoned, and murthered, whereby my Grandfather <hi>Edward</hi> the third obtained the Crowne, and now is this punishment fallen upon mee his next Successor. This is right for me to suffer, but not for you to doe, your King may for a time joy at my death, and injoy his desire, but let him qualifie his pleasure with expectation of the like justice, for God who measureth all our actions, by the malice of our mindes, will not suffer this violence to passe unrevenged; whether these words did proceed from a distempered desire, or from the judgement of his fore-sight, they were not altogether idle. Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> expecting great rewards for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratious service, was frustrate of both, and not only missed that countenance for which hee hoped, but lost that which before hee had: so odious are cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sinnes, even to him for whom they were committed; Hereupon at first hee grew discontented, and afterwards tormented in conscience, and in a rage would often exclaime, that to pleasure one ungratefull person, hee had made both himselfe and posteritie, infamous and odious to all the world; King <hi>Henry</hi> with disquiet held the kingdome during his life, and so did his Sonne King <hi>Henry</hi> the fift, in whose time by continuall warre with <hi>France.</hi> the malice of the humor was otherwise exercised and spent. But his second Successor, King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt was dispossessed thereof, and together with his young Sonne Prince <hi>Henry</hi> imprisoned and put to death, either by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or connivence of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth; and hee also escaped not free, for hee dyed not without many and manifest suspitions of poyson; And after his death his two sonnes were disinherited, imprisoned and butchered by the Vsurper, the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> who was slaine at <hi>Bosworth</hi> field, and so in his person (having no issue) the Tragedy ended. These are excellent examples, both to comfort them that are oppressed, and of terror to violent oppressors; That God in his secret judgement, doth not alwayes so certainly provide for our safetie, as revenge our wrongs and oppressions; and that all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7754:37"/>
unjust actions have a day of payment, and many times, by way of reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, even in the same manner, and measure they were committed.</p>
            <p>Thus as most of the chiefe Writers doe agree was King <hi>Richard</hi> by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence brought to his end, although all Historians agree not of the manner of the violence. Hee was a man of personage rather well proportioned then tall, of gracefull and comely presence, of good strength, and no abject spirit, but the one by ease, the other by flattery, were much abused and abased, hee deserved many friends, but found but few, because hee bought them by his bounty, not sought them by vertuous behaviour, hee was infortunate in all his actions, which may bee imputed to his slothfull carelesnesse, for hee that is not provident can seldome prosper, for his loosenesse will lose whatsoever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or other mens labours doe cast upon him; Hee lived three and thirty yeares, and raigned two and twenty; in his younger yeares he was too much ruled by greene heads, little regarding the counsell of the grave, and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Councellors, which turned to the disquiet of the Realme, and his owne destruction; Hee married two wives, the first was <hi>Anne</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth, and Sister of <hi>Winceslaus</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> shee was crowned Queene the twenty two of Ianuary 1384. but dyed without issue; The second wife was <hi>Isabell,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Charles</hi> the sixt, King of <hi>France,</hi> an infant of seven yeares of age, who after his death was returned into <hi>France,</hi> but without Dower, because the mariage was never consummate for want of copulation; The Lord <hi>Henry Piercy</hi> had the conveying of her over in <hi>Anno</hi> 1401. His dead body was embalmed and seared, and covered with leade all save the face, and carried to <hi>London,</hi> where hee had a solemne ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequie kept in the Church of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the King being present, and the chiefe Companies of the Citie: From thence hee was conveyed to <hi>Langley</hi> Abby in <hi>Buckinghamshire,</hi> and there obscurely interred by the Bishop of <hi>Chester,</hi> the Abbots of Saint <hi>Albones</hi> and <hi>Waltham,</hi> without presence of the Nobilitie, or confluence of the Commons, and without the expence of a din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, after the celebrating of the Funerall. But <hi>Henrie</hi> the fift caused his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to bee taken up and removed to <hi>Westminster,</hi> and there interred amongst the Ancestors, with Queene <hi>Anne</hi> his first wife, in expiation of his Fathers violent and unfaithfull dealing, it was not amisse in regard of the Common-wealth, that hee was dead, yet they who were actors in his death, had small reason to reckon it among their good deeds; These accidents attend such Princes as being absolute in power, will bee too resolute in will and dissolute in life.</p>

time, rashly hazard his fame or fall, but by moderation, attained safely that degree of praise, which others aspiring unto, by desperate courses wonne an ambitious death without further profit; Hee married two Wives, the first was <hi>Isabell,</hi> second Daughter and coheire of <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Castile,</hi> by whom hee had issue <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Albemarle, Richard</hi> Earle of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and <hi>Constance</hi> first married to <hi>Thomas Spencer</hi> Earle of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to <hi>Thomas Holland</hi> Earle of <hi>Kent;</hi> his second Wife was <hi>Ioane</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Thomas Holland</hi> Earle of <hi>Kent,</hi> and Sister and coheire of <hi>Edmond</hi> Earle of <hi>Kent,</hi> but by her had no issue.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> though <hi>Lucidus per intervalla,</hi> yet sensible of dishonour, moved with his Daughters disgrace, made preparation to invade <hi>England,</hi> and brought downe his Army into <hi>Piccardy,</hi> but upon the certaine relation of King <hi>Richards</hi> death, hee gave over the enterprise, and sent over Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours into <hi>England,</hi> to treate or rather intreate, that his Daughter with her Dowry might bee restored to him againe; King <hi>Henry</hi> gave them audience, and answer, that hee would speed Commissioners to <hi>Callice,</hi> to commune and conclude with them, both of this and other waighty affaires concerning both the Realmes, whither hee sent <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> Earle of <hi>Northumberland.</hi> The French King sent the Duke of <hi>Burbon</hi> and certaine others to <hi>Bulloigne;</hi> These Commissioners often met, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at one place, some-times at the other. The Frenchmen instantly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Kings Daughter to bee restored, without the doing whereof they had no order to treat of any thing. The Englishmen made a proffer to have a match betwixt Prince <hi>Henry</hi> and the Lady, alleaging that there was no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement of birth, nor disparitie of yeares betwixt them, but thereto they would give no consent, neither would they agree to the proposition of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall amitie; But in the end it was concluded, that Queene <hi>Isabell</hi> should bee redelivered to her Father, but <hi>sauns</hi> Dowry, because the marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt her and King <hi>Richard</hi> was never consummate, by reason whereof she was not Dowable upon the Treatie of the marriage, the surcease from Armes was agreed upon in King <hi>Richards</hi> dayes, for thirtie yeares, which was now mutually confirmed for the terme of these yeares unexpected.</p>
            <p>Shortly after King <hi>Henry</hi> sent the Lady <hi>Isabella</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> Lord <hi>Piercy,</hi> Earle of <hi>Worcester</hi> in royall estate to <hi>Callice,</hi> being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a brave troope of honourable Personages of both sexes, shee carried with her all the Iewells and Plate which she brought into <hi>England,</hi> with a great surplusage of rich gifts bestowed upon her by the King; At <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> shee was received by <hi>Valerian</hi> Earle of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Lieutenant in <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy,</hi> and by him conducted to her Father, who afterwards gave her in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to <hi>Charles,</hi> sonne to <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and so was rest, or rather respite of warre in <hi>France</hi> procured.</p>
            <p>But the fire and fury of the late sedition was hardly quenched: when the Welchmen upon advantage of the doubtfull, and unsettled estate of King <hi>Henry,</hi> brake forth into a defection, before the King could either lay the groundworke of his Authority, or the people frame themselves to a new obedience, and having beene taught, that common causes, must bee maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by concord, they sought by assemblies to establish an association, and to set up their owne principalitie againe; They Created for their Prince <hi>Owen Glendor,</hi> a fellow of a turbulent spirit, and factious disposition, and apt to stirre up sedition and strife, and though hee was of no great estate by birth, he was stout in stomacke, of an aspiring spirit, and wit somewhat above the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ranke of those untrained people, bold, crafty, agile, and as hee li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

bend his minde, mischievous or industrious in equall degree, in desires im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate, and rashly adventurous, more desirous to doe, then circumspect what to doe, in his younger yeares hee was a student at the Innes of Court at <hi>London,</hi> and being incensed by a verdict given against him for tithe of land, betwixt him and the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Ruthin,</hi> and by nature being a man not of the mildest disposition; by this provocation hee was made savage and rough, and determined either to repaire, or revenge his losse, by setting the whole State on fire. Also his expences had beene too excessive, for a great man to continue, which brought him to barenesse, too base for a meane man to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and therefore hee was necessitated, to doe, or dare something more then ordinary. And more danger hee thought there was in orderly dealing, then in hazarding rashly: and now opportunitie is presented, for trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some times are most fit for such attempts. And some likelihood there was, whilst the King and his Nobles were at variance, that harme might bee easily wrought to them both, upon these causes his desires were founded, and upon these troubles his hopes; But that his ambitious humour might beare some pretext of honest meaning, hee pretended to his Countrymen, the recovery of their freedome, the desire whereof is so naturally pleasing; That birds will rather live hardly abroad in the cold fields, then bee daintily dieted in a warme cage, and that now occasion was fitly offered, or else never to bee expected to ridde them of their servilitie (falsly entituled peace, whilst the Kings power was wayning, and the other not yet fully waxen, either being growen weak by wasting other, neither was there any oddes which did prevaile, sith the warre touched both alike, insomuch that warre would ruine the one, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory the other, and like the Vulture sitting on the tree, whilst the Beare and Lyon fought, they need not feare prey if either fell.</p>
            <p>Thus hee exhorted them to take courage and armes: And for the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to kill all the English within their territories, for libertie, and Lords were incompatible; Then to resume their antient Lawes and Customes, whereby more then by armes, Common-wealthes are confirmed and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, established and inlarged, so should they bee a Nation uncorrupt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out commixture of forraine manners, or blood, and so forgetting servitude, they might either live at libertie, or be lords over others, upon this many flocked unto him, the better sort for love of libertie, other in hope of bootie, insomuch that in short time, hee had under his command a competent army where with to take the field, and to make some proofe of his souldiers reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, hee set upon his old adversary the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> slew many of his men, and tooke him prisoner, yet promised him releasement, if hee would take his Daughter to wife. But the Lord at first did not so much refuse, as skorne the offer; saying, Hee was too old to bee a Ward, to have his marriage obtruded upon him; Well quoth <hi>Owen,</hi> though you bee not my Ward, yet you are in my ward, and your <hi>Ouster le maine</hi> shall cost you double the Marriage mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, you shall procure elsewhere. The Lord <hi>Gray</hi> seeing no orher meanes of his deliverance, at length accepted the condition, and tooke the Damsell to wife, yet his death preceded his enlargement.</p>
            <p>The Welchmen proceed, and breake into the borders of <hi>Hereford</hi> shire, doing much spoyle therein, against whom <hi>Edmond Mortimer</hi> Earle of <hi>March,</hi> (withdrawne for his quiet to <hi>Wigmore</hi> Castle) with the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Countrey to him assembled, did drawe head, betweene whom was a cruell conflict, not in forme of a loose skyrmish, but making a maine stand, they endevoured by might and maine, to breake and beare down each other. The courage and resolution on both sides was equall, but the Welch

The night befriended the English, with liberty to retire without running away, no man appearing to follow the chase. They lost about a thousand men, who sold their lives at such a rate, that when man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood had done the worst against them, some mannish or rather divellish wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whose rage and malice are implacable, and immortall, exercised a vaine, but barbarous revenge upon their dead bodyes, first by stripping them, then cutting off their privy parts, and noses, the one they stuffed into their mouthes, and pressed the other betweene their buttocks, yet would not suffer their carkasses thus mangled, to bee buried, untill they were ransomed by a summe of money, by which unheard-of cruell covetousnesse, the faction lost reputation and credit, with the moderate sort of their owne people, who had reason to suspect, that it was not libertie, but licentiousnesse, which was desired; And that subjection to such inhumane mindes, would be more insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable then any bondage.</p>
            <p>In this conflict the Earle of <hi>March</hi> was taken prisoner, and kept close in a darke dungeon, which was cold and dampish, where hee was overburdened with daily wants, and much misery, which were with the greater extremity, and in more abundance inflicted upon him, that thereby King <hi>Henry</hi> his kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man should be the sooner perswaded to redeeme and ransome him, hee was earnestly solicited by many of the Nobilitie, but principally by his Kinsmen the <hi>Piercies,</hi> for to procure his enlargement, but the King could not heare of that eare, hee could have beene well contented that his Sisters had beene with him there, or that all three were in heaven; For then the only blemish of his Title had beene covered over: so that it appeared thereby, that he more desired his destruction, then to procure his deliverance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glendor</hi> by his prosperous successe, was growne now more hard to bee dealt withall: proceeding further to invade the Marshes on the West side of <hi>Severne,</hi> where hee burnt many Townes, and slew much people, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with prey, and praises of his adherents where ever hee came, now hee found that weake resistance, that hee seemed rather to exercise a spoyle then a warre: King <hi>Henry</hi> being then detained with his chiefest forces, in an other more dangerous service, which besides these former vexations and hazards this first yeare of his raigne had happened unto him: For the Scots knowing that changes of Princes raignes was a time most apt for depredations, attempts, taking advantage of the absence of all the chiefe English borderers, partly by occasion of the Parliament, and partly by reason of the Pestilence which was that yeare very hot in the North parts of the Kingdome; They made a roade into the Countie of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and there did much harme, they sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised the Castle of <hi>Waroke</hi> (the Captaine whereof Sir <hi>Thomas Gray,</hi> was one of the Knights of the shire for that Parliament:) which they held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, and then plundred and dismantled it and departed, in requitall
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7754:39"/>
whereof the English invaded, burnt and spoyled certaine Ilands of <hi>Orckney,</hi> whereupon the Scots set forth a fleet, under the conduct of Sir <hi>Robert Logon,</hi> with direction to attempt as occasion should bee offered, he purposed to have begun upon our Fishermen, but by the way hee was encountred by certaine shippes of <hi>Linne,</hi> and the greatest part of his fleet was sunke or taken. Thus though peace continued still betweene both the Realmes, yet a kind of thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish hostilitie was daily practised, which after brake forth into open warre upon this occasion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Dunbar</hi> Earle of the Marches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> had affianced <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> his Daughter to <hi>David</hi> the Sonne and heire apparant of <hi>Robert</hi> King of Scots, and in consideration of marriage shortly to bee celebrated: hee had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into the Kings hands, a great summe of money for his Daughters portion; But <hi>Archibald</hi> Earle of <hi>Dowglasse,</hi> disdaining that <hi>Donbars</hi> blood should bee preferred before his, so wrought with the King, that Prince <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> refused the Earle of the <hi>Marches</hi> Daughter, and tooke to wife <hi>Mariel</hi> daughter to <hi>Dowglasse:</hi> Earle <hi>George</hi> not being used to bee confronted, or sit downe with disgrace, could hardly enforce his patience to endure this scorne. And first hee demanded restitution of his money, not so much for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to have it, as to picke an occasion to breake his Allegeance. The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to make payment, or give promise, but deluded him with frivolous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, whereupon with his family hee fled to the Earle of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> intending by disloyaltie, to revenge the indignitie: and to repaire his losses by his enemies ruine, if possible the English with wide and open armes imbrace the opportunitie, with whose helpe and assistance the Earle made divers incursions into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where hee burnt many Townes, and slew much people, enriching himselfe with booty and spoyle; King <hi>Robert</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priveth the Earle of his honour, seizeth all his lands and possessions, and writes to King <hi>Henry,</hi> that as hee would have the truce betwixt them longer to continue, either to deliver unto him, the Earle of <hi>March</hi> and his adherents, or else to banish them the Realme. King <hi>Henry</hi> perceiving that these warres arising, had almost put the peace out of joynt, was determined not to lose the benefit of the discontented subjects of his adversarie; whereupon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned answer to the Herald of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that hee was neither weary of peace, nor fearefull of warre, and ready as occasion should change, either to hold the one, or hazard the other; But the word of a Prince (was or ought to bee) of great waight: And therefore sith he had granted unto the Earle of <hi>March</hi> his safe conduct, it were a great impeachment to his honour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out just cause to violate the same. Hereupon the King of <hi>Scots</hi> did presently proclaime open warre against the King of <hi>England,</hi> who thought it pollicie rather to begin the war in the enemies countrey, then to expect it in his own, because that land which is the seat of warre, doth commonly furnish both sides with necessary supplies, the friend by contribution, the enemy by spoyle, sending certaine troopes of horsemen before him, both to espie and to induce an uncertaine terror upon the enemy, hee entred into <hi>Scotland</hi> with a puissant army, and with fire and sword proceeded, sparing nor Castle, Towne, or Citie, but burned Churches and religious houses, so that in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that hee passed, the spectacle was ugly and grisly, which hee left behinde him, being such as commonly accompany the Chariot of warre. They that fled before the army, filled all places with feare and terror, extolling above truth the English forces, to diminish thereby their shame in running from them. About the end of September hee besieged the Castle of Maydens in <hi>Edenbrough,</hi> where Prince <hi>David</hi> and Earle <hi>Douglasse</hi> were, the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7754:40"/>
of the one, and the ambition of the other, being the principall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of all this losse of blood; During this siege, <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> the Governour (during the King of <hi>Scots</hi> inabilitie through sicknesse to manage the businesse) sent an Harold to King <hi>Henry,</hi> protesting upon his honour, that if hee would abide but five dayes at the most, hee would either remove the siege, or lose his life. The King bountifully rewarded the Harold, and promised in the word of a Prince, to abide there during the time by him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed; But six times sixe dayes were past, but neither Governour, nor other appeared, Winter came on, victuall in the Campe fayled, the Countrie was cold and comfortlesse, it rained every day in great abundance, which distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of weather, and want of befitting sustenance, caused the death of many a tall souldier: it may bee these discommodities arising, stayed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour from performing his promise, for policie was against it, to hazard his men to fight, when Winter and want, two forcible foes, had given the charge upon his enemy, sure it is, that they moved the King to remove his siege, and depart out of <hi>Scotland</hi> unfought with; Both the Wardens of the <hi>Marches,</hi> were all this time in <hi>Scotland</hi> with the King, upon which advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, the Scots did breake into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and did some spoyle in <hi>Banborough</hi> shire, the English quickly tooke the Alarum, but the Scots with as much speed retired; But when King <hi>Henry</hi> had discharged his Army, the Scots not so desirous of life, as revenge, made a speedy road into <hi>England,</hi> under the conduct of Sir <hi>Thomas Hahbarton</hi> of <hi>Dirleton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Patricke Heborne</hi> of <hi>Hales,</hi> but all the hurt they did, did rather waken then weaken the English, and they themselves were somewhat encouraged, but nothing enriched by what they had got; But Sir <hi>Patrick</hi> puft up with desire &amp; hope, resolved upon a greater exployt; The people which are easily led by prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, in great numbers resorted unto him, but he was loath to have more fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in the spoyles, then he thought should need in the danger, therefore with a competent Army of the men of <hi>Loughdeane,</hi> he invaded <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where he made great spoyle, and loded his souldiers with prisoners and prey. They thought of no perill that might bee in the retrayt: so they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched loosly and licentiously, neither keeping themselves to their colours, or rankes: But the Earle of <hi>Northumberlands</hi> Vicewarden, and other Borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in good array, set upon them at a Towne called <hi>Nesbyt;</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly received the charge, and the battell was sharpe, in the end the <hi>Scots</hi> rankes grew thin, as being rather confusedly shouffled together then orderly composed, which when the Vice warden felt with a company, which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely retained about him for sudden dispatches, hee charged them home and rowted them; Sir <hi>Patricke</hi> bereaved of counsell and comfort, ranne up and downe, from place to place, commanding many things, and presently forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them; And the lesse of force his directions were, the oftner did hee change them, at last (as it hapneth in lost and desperate cases) every man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Commander, but none a putter in execution, so the rankes loosed and brake, and could not bee reunited: the Victor closely pursuing the advantage, Sir <hi>Patricke</hi> thinking of nothing lesse, then either flying or yeelding, but thrusting himselfe amongst the thickest of the enemies, honourably lost his life: many of his Linage, and the flower of <hi>Loughdeane</hi> were likewise slaine, there were taken Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>William Cockborne,</hi> Sir <hi>William Basse, Iohn</hi> and <hi>Thomas Hablington</hi> Esquires, and a multitude of common souldiers; on the English part no great number were slaine, and none of ranke or qualitie.</p>
            <p>About this time King <hi>Henry</hi> sent his eldest Daughter <hi>Blaunch,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied

            <p>About the midst of August, the King with a great power went into <hi>Wales</hi> to pursue <hi>Owen Glendour,</hi> but lost his labour, for <hi>Glendour</hi> had conveyed himselfe into his lurking holes amongst the Mountaines; The King through the extremitie of foule weather, was enforced to retire, having spoyled and burnt a great part of the Country round about.</p>
            <p>The Scots under the leading of <hi>Archibald Dowglasse,</hi> about the number of twenty thousand, with barbarous crueltie entred into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> making havocke by the way, but at a place called <hi>Homildon</hi> they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred by the English, under the leading of <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Piercy</hi> surnamed <hi>Hotspur,</hi> and <hi>George</hi> Earle of <hi>March</hi> on holy-rood day in harvest, who put them to flight and tooke prisoners, after the slaughter of ten thousand of them, five hundred: whereof <hi>Mordack</hi> Earle of <hi>Fife</hi> (the sonne of the Generall who in the fight lost one of his eyes) <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle <hi>Murry, Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Angus,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Atholl</hi> and <hi>Mentits</hi> were chiefe, and amongst the slaine were, Sir <hi>Iohn Swinton,</hi> Sir <hi>Adam Gordon,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Leviston,</hi> Sir <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Ramsey</hi> of <hi>Dalehowsey,</hi> and twenty three other Knights. <hi>Piercy</hi> having put his prisoners in safe keeping, entred <hi>Tividale</hi> wasting all in the way, and there besieged the Castle of <hi>Cockclawes,</hi> of which Sir <hi>Iohn Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> was Captaine, who upon condition that if hee were not relieved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three moneths compounded to surrender the Castle.

            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King to backe <hi>Glendour</hi> in his trayterous designes (not so much for love of him, as hatred to King <hi>Henry)</hi> sent twelve hundred men of qualitie, to bee Captaines and Commanders, to those rebellious disorderly troopes, but the windes were so contrary, and the violence of the storme such, that they lost twelve of their best ships with their fraught, and the rest with great difficultie returned to <hi>France.</hi> The English deriding the whilst the French Kings ill successe, whose enterprises though they threatned much, yet they alwayes vanished to nothing.

But the event proved those blinde fantasticall dreames of the Welch Southsayers to bee <hi>Deviationes non divinationes;</hi> In the meane time King <hi>Henry,</hi> not acquainted with these Conspiracies, caused a Proclamation to bee made, intimating thereby, that the Earle of <hi>March</hi> had voluntarily caused himselfe to bee taken prisoner.

               <item>2. <hi>Item,</hi> That not only as an arch-Traytor hee had imprisoned his owne Liege Lord, and undoubted Master, King <hi>Richard,</hi> but had caused him to bee barbarously murthered, that so with the grearer securitie hee might enjoy his Masters Crowne and Kingdome.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Item,</hi> that eversince the death of King <hi>Richard,</hi> hee had unjustly kept the Kingdome, and the Crowne from his Kinsman <hi>Edmond Mortymer</hi> Earle of <hi>March,</hi> who was the Sonne and heire apparant of <hi>Philip</hi> the Daughter and heire of <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> elder brother to <hi>Iohn of Gaunt,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the new usurping King.</item>
               <item>4. <hi>Item,</hi> That when neither present occasion, or need compelled him, hee had imposed divers Taxes and Subsidies upon the people, to their great griefe and impoverishing, whereof they willingly would but durst not complaine.</item>
               <item>5. <hi>Item,</hi> That no justice could bee expected at his hand, because that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the oath which hee had taken when hee was Crowned, hee had by Letters sent into sundry Shires, and thereby procured certaine Burgesses of the Parliament, and Knights of the Shire to bee chosen, whom hee knew would not faile to serve his turne, as occasion should bee offered.</item>
               <item>6. And lastly, That where in honour, and for affinities sake, hee ought to have ransomed, or redeemed his said Cousin the Earle of <hi>March,</hi> from his lothesome imprisonment, (being by some of his Privie Councell thereto of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten solicited;) hee not only denyed the said request, but falsly and untruly published and declared, that the Earle himselfe, was of his owne accord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a voluntary Prisoner, to the end that Traitors and Rebells joyning with him, might have somewhat wherewith to colour such Treasons as they would conspire or plot against him.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For which causes, and many other as bad, they defied him, as an usurping Traytor, and as an utter enemy, they vowed his destruction, and the restoring of the said Earle to his right.</p>
            <p>The King perceiving that nothing but strength of blowes could end this strife: and being perswaded that if hee could victoriously suppresse this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, hee should bereave his enemies from future hope to prevaile in the like attempts, with a great and well-composed Army, hee marched towards the Lords, forecasting in his March, how to prevent the English from joyning with the Welch, which with a provident care hee prevented, and about <hi>Shrowsburie</hi> on Saturday Saint <hi>Marie Magdalens</hi> eve, hee encountred the <hi>Piercies,</hi> the Scots gave a brave onset on the King, but hee so welcommed them, that scarce one was left unhurt, but most of them slaine, yet the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators stoutly maintained the fight, and pursued it with that courage and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7754:42"/>
resolution, that they were confident of good successe, untill the King with the young Prince <hi>Henrie,</hi> and some young branches of honourable stockes in their company, (bravely resolving rather to die honourably then to live dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefully) put to their strengths to joyne with Valor, and with a noble emulation to give faire example each to other; They so shooke the enemies vauntguard, that <hi>Hotspur</hi> and some other chiefe Commanders on his side, and many thousands more were slaine. The Earle of <hi>Worcester</hi> was taken Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the field, together with Sir <hi>Richard Vernon,</hi> Sir <hi>Theobald Trussell,</hi> and the Baron of <hi>Kindarton,</hi> and the rest fled. On the Kings part (besides the Earle of <hi>Stafford,</hi> who had but that morning revolted from the other side) were slaine Sir <hi>Hugh Sherley,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Clifton,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Cockayne,</hi> Sir <hi>Nicholas Gansell,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Blunt,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Calverley,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> of <hi>Puddington,</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh Mortymer,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Gausell,</hi> all which had beene but that morning before Dubbed Knights, with Sir <hi>Thomas Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desley,</hi> who afterwards died of the wounds there received. This <hi>Edmond Stafford</hi> was third Sonne of Earle <hi>Hugh,</hi> and after the death of <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>William,</hi> who dyed without issue, was Earle of <hi>Stafford</hi> and Lord of <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> hee married <hi>Anne,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Woodstocke</hi> Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> by whom hee had issue <hi>Humphry</hi> afterward Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> that dyed young, and <hi>Anne</hi> first married to <hi>Edmond Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymer</hi> Earle of <hi>March,</hi> but had no issue by him, and after was married to <hi>Iohn Holland</hi> Earle of <hi>Huntington,</hi> by whom shee had issue <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Exceter:</hi> of common souldiers the King lost about sixteene hundred, but had made slaughter of above sixe thousand of the Conspirators (whereof thirty sixe fell by his owne sword) neverthelesse <hi>Dowglasse</hi> once unhorsed him, and in his presence slew Sir <hi>Walter Blunt,</hi> who with divers others that day were in all things habited alike to the King, for which so brave exploit, after <hi>Dowglasse</hi> by the unfortunate fall of his horse (having broken two of his ribbes) being taken Prisoner, was by the Kings speciall command careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dressed and attended, and ransomelesse, with great commendation set at liberty, so farre can vertue prevaile with a grievous foe.</p>
            <p>The day following the King with the whole Army with great show of zeale, gave God thankes for this victory, by his assistance so happily atchieved, and then caused the Earle of <hi>Worcester</hi> to be beheaded, &amp; many of the Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders of that rebellion, to bee drawne, hanged, and quartered, and their heads placed on <hi>London</hi> bridge. This <hi>Thomas Piercie</hi> Earle of <hi>Worcester.</hi> and Lord high Admirall of <hi>England,</hi> married <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> eldest Sister and coheire of <hi>David</hi> Earle of <hi>Athol,</hi> by whom hee had issue, <hi>Henrie</hi> Earle of <hi>Atholl;</hi> After this the King sent <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> with the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into that Countrey; But before his comming, <hi>Owen Glendor</hi> was aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by all his Company, and lurking in the Woods was there famished, many of his associates were taken, and there put to death, and the Prince joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully returned to the King.</p>
            <p>Whilst the Prince was in <hi>Wales, Henry Piercy</hi> the Earle of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> of his owne accord came, and submitted himselfe to the King, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny oathes and protestations of his innocency, as not being once acquainted with any intent of Treason and rebellion. And though the King conceived not the least thought that might excuse him, yet for that time hee gave him a seeming show of faire entertainment, and for that time with gentle language and kind countenance, as it was thought, for that hee had the possession of <hi>Barwicke</hi> Castle, and other places of strength in his power, permitted to goe free, and come at his pleasure.</p>

For the discordancie of Writers of those times, have left too many scrupulous questions about his descent and originall surname; I have therefore as neere (as God hath enabled mee) endevoured to cleere the point, and what with some search I have found hereof, to set downe the truth; And though to some it may here appeare impertinent, yet I presume it will not altogether prove unprofitable.</p>
            <p>In the yeare of our Lord God 1324. <hi>William</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iohn Long,</hi> was borne at <hi>Witkham</hi> in the Countie of <hi>Southampton;</hi> This <hi>Iohn</hi> was Parish Clerke of <hi>Wickham</hi> aforesaid, in which place hee taught Children to write, and amongst others his owne sonne, who profited so well, that hee attained to the writing of a very faire hand; a qualitie in those dayes much respected, and by the better sort greatly desired.</p>

            <p>But within short time after notwithstanding his watchfull care in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, to give no occasion of offence (as neere as possible to any) much lesse to the King, yet hee was falne into the jawes of Envie (a common plague to Court favourites) and by some or others be traduced to the King; For over-ambitiously affecting vaine-glory, as arrogating the renowne of the Kings choice-peece of building to bee the worke of <hi>VVickham</hi> only, and for an instance thereof, they produce a sculpture in a stone of the wall in <hi>VVin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> Tower in <hi>VVindsor</hi> Castle, set up at that time, when hee was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in that worke which imported<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7754:43"/>
saying, the King sharply reprehendeth <hi>VVickham;</hi> To whom <hi>VVickham</hi> modestly replieth, that it was farre from his thought to ascribe by that inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Honour of building that tower to himselfe, but his owne good hap for being preferred to that worke: for not by any indifferent construction, the words may seeme to import, that <hi>VVickham</hi> built that Tower; But his imployment thereabouts, was the cause of making and preferring of <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> for thereby hee had gained his Majesties gratious favour and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>By this answer the King was pacified, and as it were to make <hi>VVickham</hi> amends, and deterre his calumniators from further persisting in such their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious courses, the Kings favour is daily increased towards him; and hee is enriched with many faire preferments; Insomuch that within few yeares by the assistance and plotting of <hi>Iohn Buckingham</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> and Sir <hi>Simon Burleigh</hi> Knight, two of his antient and most intimate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in <hi>Oxford,</hi> hee had gotten into his possession, besides the spirituall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings before remembred, twelve severall Prebendships, and by dispensation from Pope <hi>Vrban;</hi> and qualification by being the Kings Chaplaine, hee held at one time in his hands, so many Ecclesiasticall livings and promotions, as the valew of them did amount in the Kings bookes, to the summe of eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred seventy sixe pounds thirteene shillings and foure pence, in those <note place="margin">In regist.

Now whilst his wealth and worship every day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1356. <hi>VVilliam Edendon</hi> Bishop of <hi>VVinchester</hi> departed <note place="margin">Fox.

The King hearing how much the insufficiencie of scholler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <note place="margin">Godwyn. fol. 184.</note> was obtruded upon <hi>VVickham,</hi> began to expostulate with him to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease further suit for the place, which required to bee supplied by a man of more sufficiencie in Clerkship then hee was, to whom <hi>VVickham</hi> replied, that so please his Majestie to continue his gratious favour towards him, so that hee might obtaine his desire therein, hee doubted not, but by Gods speciall assistance, so to behave himselfe, that hee would supply all defects of schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lership in himselfe by providing for others meanes and maintenance, to make and keepe able persons for the service of the State, and the good of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; wherewith the King was so taken, that hee wrought so effectually; That in the yeare 1367. hee was consecrated Bishop of <hi>VVinchester,</hi> and was restored to all profits of that Bishopricke, during the vacancie.</p>
            <p>Within short time after hee was made Lord Treasurer, and was imployed and trusted with all the affaires of the kingdome, and had the disposition of all the Kings Treasure, which was the occasion to advantage his enemies to strike the more easily at him; For the King by the new Bishops care being rid of many troubles, yet tooke a further benefit thereby: for whatsoever

was done that displeased the Councell, or the Commons that was objected to the Bishop, whereby when the Kings wants were pressing, it was held the best pollicie at that time, to give the King a supply, by squeezing the full moistned spunge of the Bishops coffers. And to yeeld some colour for their so doing; The Bishop is charged to give account for eleven hundred ninetie sixe thousand pounds received, during the time of his being Treasurer, besides a hundred thousand Francks delivered him by <hi>Galeaze</hi> Duke of <hi>Millaine,</hi> which must bee suddenly performed, and the more to puzzle him at that very instant, divers untrue and feyned cavillations by way of complaint, are put up against him at the Councell boord; to the answering whereof hee is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly convented, where whilst hee is intentive to save the bye, hee hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the losse of the maine, for whilst hee indevoureth to give satisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to the foresaid calumniations; Iudgement is through the earnest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> by <hi>William Skipwith</hi> Lord chiefe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice upon an information of deceipt suggested, awarded in the Kings bench against him, by meanes whereof, all his temporalties were seized upon, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the Kings hands, and given to the Prince of <hi>VVales.</hi>

            <p>And for a further addition to his affliction by <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunts</hi> meanes, hee is in the Kings name commanded upon paine of his Majesties high displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, not to come within twenty miles of the Court. The Bishop with a cleere conscience, and a constant resolution, awaits a fitter time to crave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of this sentence against him, and like a discreet Pilat playeth with the wave, which if hee should meet might indanger him, and by giving way thereto, escapeth the hazard; Accesse to the King hee knew not how to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, to pacifie the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> hee saw no possibilitie, and how to procure any course to bee taken for his benefit, hee was altogether ignorant; His trayne therefore hee dismisseth, expecting some few, of whose honest fidelitie, and otherwayes sufficiencie hee had made sufficient proofe, these he imployeth to write out and ballast his accounts, and such answers, as hee had made to the accusations and informations which as aforesaid were exhibited against him, which perfected, the Copyes thereof, hee privately disperseth amongst his brethren of the Clergie; and such other, as hee presumed would without prejudice to his cause, vouchsafe the reading of them; And therein amongst other things hee at large setteth forth the ground, or occasion of the Duke of <hi>Lancasters</hi> irreconciliable malice against him, which was thus, Queene <hi>Philip</hi> wife to <hi>Edward</hi> the third upon her death-bed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by way of <note place="margin">Continuator histo.

            <p>And so it chanced, that within short time after a Parliament is convoked, wherein the Kings necessitie of present supply of money is much prest; But the Clergie unanimously affirme, that without their Brother the Bishop of <hi>VVinchesters</hi> presence, they neither can, nor will consult of any thing, and therefore crave that hee might bee permitted to come; The King being told that hee being a principall member of the house of Parliament, could not with conveniencie bee excluded; Whereupon hee is sent for.</p>
            <p>The Bishop upon notice of the Kings pleasure repaireth to <hi>London,</hi> but in that obscure manner, and with that small retinue, that hee ministred occasion of commiseration to the beholders; which so incensed the Duke of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> that hee not only continued his indignation against the Bishop of <hi>VVin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> but openly did oppose all the Bishops in generall, protecting and countenancing <hi>VVickliffe,</hi> a man of more zeale then discretion, in all his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold and undutifull carriages towards them. In the meane time <hi>VVinchester</hi> having sufficiently learned, that the King now in his declining time, did so dote upon <hi>Alice Pierce,</hi> that in a manner hee was altogether governed by her, complies himselfe wholly to her, and so effectually <hi>aut prece aut pretio,</hi> or both, made his way with her, that mauger all what the Duke could say, or doe to the contrary, after two yeares being kept out of his livings by her meanes, the Bishop is restored fully to whatsoever had beene taken, or was detayned from him.</p>
            <p>The Parliament dissolved, the Bishop commeth to <hi>VVinchester,</hi> where as well by the Citizens, as Pryor and Covent, hee is joyfully with kinde wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and generall procession received and entertained; Then and there also hee receiveth of the Executors of his Predecessors Bishop <hi>Edington</hi> satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the summe of one thousand one hundred sixtie two pounds tenne shillings, and for the valew of one thousand five hundred fiftie sixe rother beasts; three thousand eight hundred seventie sixe Weather-sheepe, foure thousand seven hundred and seventeene Ewes, three thousand five hundred twentie one Lambes, and one thousand one hundred twentie seven Swine, <note place="margin">Vbi supra.</note> formerly recovered against them for d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7754:45"/>

            <p>And now having in readinesse all requirable utensells, his first worke was the building of a Chappell at <hi>Tytchfeid,</hi> where his Father, Mother, and sister <hi>Perrot</hi> were buried, endowing the same with proportionable maintenance for a Priest to performe the Ceremonies in those dayes used, for the benefit of the soules departed.</p>
            <p>Hee founded at <hi>Southwicke</hi> in the Countie of <hi>Southampton</hi> neere the Towne of <hi>Wickham,</hi> the place of his birth, as a supplement to the Priory of <hi>Southwicke</hi> a Chauntry with sufficient aliment, and all other necessaries for five Priests for ever.</p>
            <p>Hee bestowed twentie thousand Markes in orderly repairing the houses belonging to the Bishopricke.</p>
            <p>He discharged out of prison in all places of his Diocesse, all such poore prisoners as lay in execution for debt under twenty pounds, about which hee expended two thousand pounds.</p>
            <p>Hee sufficiently amended all the high wayes from <hi>Winchester</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> on both sides the River.</p>
            <p>Hee procured large immunities to the Sea of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and purchased lands thereto, to the valew of two hundred Markes <hi>per annum,</hi> with a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in Mortmaine for two hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi> more.</p>
            <p>In the eleventh yeare of the Raigne of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, he receiueth from the Kings owne hands the great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> and is made Lord Chancellor, whereby it appeareth that King <hi>Richard</hi> was not altogether so voide of judgement in the choice of his Officers of eminencie, as the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his time would seeme to make him.</p>
            <p>At his returne from Court, hee called all his Officers to account, amongst whom hee remitted the summe of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> foure thousand pounds, in which they were arere, and gave to every one of them respectively a generall release of all demands untill that time.</p>
            <p>Hee likewise remitted unto the tenements of the Bishopricke, all such customary payments of knowledge money, as were by his Officers affirmed to bee due unto him, in the whole, amounting to the summe of five hundred and twentie pounds.</p>
            <p>But now as if whatsoever was done before had beene but an essay of what hee intended to doe after, hee began to lay the foundation of that magnificent structure in <hi>Oxford,</hi> at that and till this time called new Colledge. And upon the fift day of March <hi>Anno Dom.</hi>

            <p>The next yeare following, that is to say, the 26. day of March 1387. hee likewise in person layed the first stone of the like foundation, neere the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Winchesters</hi> Pallace in the Soake by <hi>Winchester,</hi> called <hi>Woolvesey to Let</hi> in manner of a Nursery or Seminarie of Grammarians to be fitted and made ready for his Colledge in <hi>Oxford;</hi> And in the like space of sixe yeares finished the same, and Dedicated the same as that other in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and as afore at three of the clocke upon the 28. of March 1393. hee gave seizen thereof unto the, by him then chosen Warden, Fellowes, and Schollers, <hi>Iohn Morrice</hi> Clerke being the first Warden, <hi>Iohn Milton</hi> the first Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master.</p>
            <p>His provident care likewise was such, that hee not only finished these two so renowned Colledges, and every way for the present furnished the same with all needfull and necessary accommodations for the maintenance of them in a most liberall proportion; But devised and appointed such, and so many directory rules and statutes, for the well ordering and good government of the same; That it ministred just occasion to a most reverend Archbishop to write, and give this true testimony of him and them.</p>

to remove the cause of doubt from your heart, now much more then is that requirable by the lawes of filiall respect, and naturall proximitie of blood and duty, That I your sonne and servant, in my owne particular am tide to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the least suspition of unthankfulnesse in mee, and danger thereby to you, should for the better securing your quiet, tender my life as a forfeit to your Highnesse, for giving cause of question of loyaltie to you, that that being taken away, and the ground of your jealousie being removed, you might with more securitie, enjoy the quiet of an undisturbed minde. To this end having this morning with a Christian preparation of humble Confession, and receiving the blessed Sacrament of the blood and passion of my Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ Iesus, fitted my selfe to bee made a sacrifice, to exterminate your jealousie, I have presumed to approach your seat of Majestie; And therefore I humbly beseech you to ease your heart, and hereby to take assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of your future quiet, by giving a period to my griefe, and your feare; and to give this ponyard a passage thorow my heart (and therewithall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched his dagger, holding it by the point to his Father) for I desire not to live longer, then to bee justly thought to bee what I am, and shall ever bee, your faithfull and obedient vassall, which if you shall vouchsafe to doe, here in the presence of your Nobilitie, I doe cleerely forgive the fact in this world, and before God and his holy Angels at the day of Iudgement will acquite you thereof; These words had that penetrating propertie, and the King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with was so moved, that casting the dagger away, he rose out of his Chaire, but for weaknesse not able to stand, fell upon his sonnes necke, and with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teares embracing him, confessed that his eares had beene too open to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive reports against him, and promising by the love of a Father, and the faith of a King from thenceforth, that misreport should not cause his disaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <note place="margin">The King &amp; Prince recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.</note> hee assured him, that at the next Parliament, those whisperers against him should undergoe the censure of their Peeres, and stand at his mercy for the scandalls by them against him raised, to whom the Prince replyed, God forgive them, I doe; And so with generall content they departed.</p>
            <p>And from that time forth, untill his departure out of this life, the King en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a calme from all hostilitie, either at home or abroad; And to expresse his great thankfulnesse to God for this his greater goodnesse to him, hee tooke upon him the Crusado, and complaining of the inconsiderate courses of the <note place="margin">The King having taken upon him the Crusado pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</note> Princes of Christendome, that were more intentive to waste, and weary one another with intestine and uncivill broyles, rather then to joyne hand in hand, to oppose themselves against the common enemy of their faith the Turke; whereto hee was perswaded that in conscience they were bound; To ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate them therefore by his Example to doe the like, hee made great prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, both of men, money, and amunition for that service, with intention the next Spring to set forward to recover <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> To this purpose he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Councell in the White Fryers, where order was taken for the provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all things ready for the voyage by Sea to the Holyland, and convoked a Parliament to begin on Candlemasse day following; And now all things being ready for the expedition against the Turkes; The enemy of mankind seized upon him with an Apoplexie, the fits whereof divers times, would show him dead to those about him, but ever upon his recovery againe of sense, hee would demaund for his Crowne, which hee appointed all the time of his sicknesse to bee placed upon a cushion in his sight; At length the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of the disease increasing, hee lay as though all his vitall spirits had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken him, insomuch that those that were about him deemed him dead, and covered his face. The Prince having notice thereof, came and tooke away

the Crowne, and departed, the Father reviving, demaunded for the Crown, and hearing that the Prince had taken it, hee sends for him, and angerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth his reason of his so doing; to whom the Prince with a confident brow made answer; That in his, and all mens judgement there present hee was dead, and then I being next heire apparant to the same, tooke it as my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitat right, not as yours but mine, well said the King and sighed, faire Son what right I had to it God knoweth; But saith the Prince, if you dye King, I doubt not to hold the garland, as you have done with my sword against all opposers; Then saith the King, I referre all to God, but charge thee on my blessing, and as thou wilt answer it before the Tribunall of God: That thou minister the Lawes indifferently; that thou ease the oppressed; that thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Flatterers; that thou doe not deferre Iustice, nor bee sparing of mercy, but punish the oppressours of thy people, and suffer not officers to make their places the staulking horses to their will, so shalt thou obtaine favour of God, and love of thy Subjects, who whilst they have wealth, so long shalt thou have obedience, but being made poore by oppression, will be ever ready to stirre, and make insurrections; And so turning about, said, God blesse thee, <note place="margin">The death of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth.</note> and have mercy on mee, and so hee gave up the ghost in a Chamber of the Abbot of <hi>Westminster,</hi> which the servants there called <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of March 1412. in the fortieth sixe yeare of his age, when hee had <note place="margin">An. 1412.

After the solemnitie past, the next day hee caused all his wonted Companions to come into his presence, to whom hee used these words; It is sufficient, that for many yeares together, I have fashioned my selfe to your unruly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, <note place="margin">King <hi>Henry</hi> taketh leave of his antient companions.</note> and have (not without some reluctation, in the very action) fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed you in your debosht and swaggering courses, I have to my sorrow and shame, I may say to thinke of it, irregularly wandered, in all rude and unseemely manner, in the vast wildernesse of ryot and unthriftinesse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I was made almost an alian, to the hearts of my Father and Allyes, and in their opinions violently carried away by your meanes from grace, by keeping you company, therein I have so vilified my selfe, that in the eyes of men, my presence was vulgar and stale, and like the Cuckow in Iune, heard but not regarded. One of you being convented before the Lord chiefe Iustice for misusing a sober-minded Citizen, I went to the publike Sessions house, and stroke him on the face, and being by him deservedly committed to the <hi>Fleet,</hi> (for which act of justice I shall ever hold him worthy the place, and my favour, and wish all my Iudges to have the like undaunted courage, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish offendors of what ranke soever) it occasioned my Father to put mee from my place in Councell, appointing it to bee supplyed by my younger Brother, how often have I by your animation committed thefts, even on my Fathers and my owne Receivers, and robd them of the mony provided for publicke appointments, to maintaine your midnight revellings, and noone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selings; But it is time now to give a period to these exorbitant, and unbefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting courses, and to salve the wounds my intemperance hath made in my

reputation, and to turne over a new leafe, and not only to decline the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of such misleaders of yours, but desert their conditions, of all therefore I straightly charge and command you, and every one of you, that from henceforth untill you have settled your selves in a more orderly course of life, and redeeme your pawnd credits, with faire and regarded behaviour, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after upon paine of forfeiture of your heads, not to appeare in my presence, nor to come within the verge of my Court; For what is past I will grant you my pardon, and withall, because I know sometimes necessitie will cripple honesty, I will allow each of you a competency of maintenance, as a stocke to begin a course whereby to live orderly hereafter; But take heed of relaps<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the least complaint of ill-behaviour of any of you hereafter, if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, shall forfeit your pardons, and exclude my favour for ever: which reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of mine I will never breake, and so without attending any reply hee departed. And afterwards, to show others the way, hee disposed himselfe to a new course of deportment, qualifying his cariage with such magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and heroicall vertues, as might best become the Person of so great a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate, and knowing that howsoever wee ought to live by lawes, and not by examples, yet mans nature is presently carried away with imitation, hee preferred to places of iudicature, and publike administration of Iustice, such as were truly noble, wise, discreet, modest and temperate, well able to command others, and to rule themselves; out of which hee selected a choice number of the ablest braines, to bee of his Privie Councell. Hee indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously indevoured to reforme the pride, covetousnesse, sloth, and other abuses crept among the Clergie, enjoyning them to more regular life, and sincere serving of Almighty God, commanding the reformation of disorders tenovation of discipline, punishment of irregularitie and amendment of life; And with moderate severitie caused such administrations of the lawes that hee made, both spiritualtie and laitie, tractable to the performance of their severall duties; Then to establish safetie at home, that hee might not bee molested, either with the Welch or Scots, hee erected divers Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, and Bulwarkes upon their Frontiers, and furnished them both with necessaries, and able Commanders, so that hee was still powerfully ready to suppresse all insurrections or rebellions, that might bee attempted from thence.</p>
            <p>Immediately after Easter hee called a Parliament, but in the interim, most <note place="margin">The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse of the Nobilitie to tender their homage</note> of the Nobilitie before his Coronation, an usuall course never before done, did strive to outgoe each other in forward, tender, and doing their homage, all most willingly swearing to him Allegeance and doing fealtie; On Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Sunday the Obsequies for his Father were solemnly performed, himselfe and most of the Nobilitie being at <hi>Canterbury</hi> at the offering present.</p>
            <p>Shortly after he caused the body of King <hi>Richard</hi> the second to be brought from <hi>Langley</hi> to <hi>Westminster,</hi> and there buried with great solemnitie by his first wife Queene <hi>Anne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time the opinion of <hi>Wickliffe</hi> notwithstanding the care taken to suppresse it by the wisdome of the Parliament, and the courses appointed in their Convocation-house by the Clergie, began to bee generally dispersed, insomuch that Sir <hi>Iohn Oldcastle</hi> in right of his Wife called in courtesie Lord <hi>Cobham.</hi> a man of a bold and resolute disposition, and a stout Souldier, was convented before the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for broching and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning many novell positions, against the received <hi>tenet</hi> of the Church, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor <note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Oldcastle</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</note> of whose accusation, was by <hi>Henry Chichley</hi> then Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> presented unto the King, who in commiseration of the Knight,

required the Prelates, that if hee were a strayed sheepe, to reduce him to the fold, rather by gentle courses, then severitie. And himselfe afterwards sending for him did earnestly exhort him to reconcile himselfe to God and the Church, and to submit himselfe to the constitutions thereof, but Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> first by word of mouth then by writing, seemed to justifie his assertions, affirming that his Grace was supreame head, and his competent judge and no other; And that hee would come to his purgation with an hundred Knights and Esquires, or fight in defence of his just cause in open Lists.</p>
            <p>But the King by his Councell being informed, That by the law, accusations touching questions of beliefe, ought to bee tryed by the spirituall jurisdiction, hee sent him to the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> And afterward upon the three and twentieth day of September, a Convocation was held in the Church of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and upon the five and twentieth day following, another in the Hall of the <hi>Black-fryers,</hi> in which places the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> was fully heard, to vent a spittle of diseased opinions, and thereupon was by the <note place="margin">

King <hi>Henry</hi> having notice, that hee must of force passe another River in his way, over which there was but one passable Bridge, hee commanded certaine troopes of horse to goe thither on the spurre, and some foot Companies to speed thither to second them, and to make good the same, untill the Army should come. When the horse came thither, they found the French very busie in breaking downe the bridge, but perceiving the approach of the English, they left their worke and fled; the passage being cleered, upon the two &amp; twentieth of Octob. the King of <hi>England</hi> passed over with his Army.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> that lead the reareward, sent word to the King, that his skowtes had discovered the enemy to come on apace, whereupon hee made a stand, and gave direction to the Officers, what course to take, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint their souldiers, that to flye would but cause a lingring death, for their flight would bee out of the pan into the fire, there being no place of refuge neere, and the way thither (if any were) was altogether unknowne: And so mounting on horsebacke, hee road from place to place, assuring them of his resolution to live and die with them, and so with his word and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance hee so encouraged his men, that they were generally resolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and dye, and accordingly prepared themselves, reconciling themselves to God by confession, and receiving the Sacrament, and lastly embracing each other with constant protestations, to bee firme and faithfull one to the other: so upon Friday the five and twentieth of October, being derayned in order of battell, they attended the signall to begin.</p>

six foot long, to bee pitched behind the Archers, and appointed the Pioners to attend, to remove them, as occasion and direction gave order; These things thus ordered, publike prayers were humbly made, and the onset was expected, which was presently performed by the French horsmen, who gave on with a furious bravado, but Sir <hi>Walter Orpington</hi> who was thereunto <note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the sight.</note> appointed, giving the signall, the English gave a great showte, whereupon according to direction, the Bowmen behind the hedges sent forth such a showre of Arrowes, that the French horse thereby galled, were so unruly, that their riders could not force them to give against the ditch, to come at those that were beyond the ditch; Whereupon the Vantguard of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, taking advantage of their disorder made forward, and powred another volly of arrowes among them, by meanes whereof the horse thorowly gald, either cast their riders, or through their unrulinesse so opened their ranckes, that the right Wing of the English horse gave in so manly, that the French horse disorderly retiring, broke the aray of their foot, who were miserably <note place="margin">The disorder of the French.</note> trod downe, and disrancked with their owne Company; by this the two hundred Bowmen having emptied their quivers, flung away their Bowes, and with their swords fell upon the enemy, and wresting from them their owne weapons, made a great slaughter among them: and putting the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to flight, they adventured upon the middle battaile, which the French <note place="margin">The English having row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the van charge the battaile of the French.</note> horsmen taking in scorne to be charged with so small a company, bravely gave on; Whereupon the English made show of retiring, but when they came where the Bowmen were Impaled with the armed stakes, they made a stand: and as the horsmen were thereby gored, they were ready to helpe them forward with a pat on the pate with a browne Bill to their last home, whereby their maine battaile was broken and disordered, when presently the King with his maine battell gave on with that resolution, that himselfe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son charged the Duke of <hi>Alanson,</hi> by whom hee was in his carere wel-nie unhorsed: but afterward hee having slaine two of the Dukes men that were neerer to him then the Duke, hee charged the Duke againe, and with his sword beat him from his horse, whom the Kings guard notwithstanding the King cryed out to the contrary slew out-right, and with his fall the maine battaile of the French first gave ground, then turned their backes, and lastly flung away their weapons and fled.

            <p>The Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> was sent to <hi>Cawdbecke,</hi> standing betwixt <hi>Roane</hi> and the Sea; The Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> sent Sir <hi>Iohn Bromley</hi> and <hi>George Vmphrevile</hi> with an hundred Archers, and two hundred Bill-men to a little Castle called the <hi>Strowe,</hi> and in the way were met by eight hundred French; Whereupon Sir <hi>Iohn Bromley</hi> casting his Bow-men in a limasson or loose ring, and his Bill-men in two squares, which in close order marched towards the enemy, who seeing the number to appeare so small, gave on in that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly manner, that their Captaine the Lord of <hi>Estrisles</hi> was slaine, before any of his company could come to the reskewes; The Bow-men opening their order, delivered such a shole of arrowes even in the middest of their enemies, that they stood amazed untill they were awakened with a second; The Bow-men as long as the arrowes lasted, kept the enemy aloofe, but at length they were enforced to make use of their slaine enemies weapons, with which they closing to the Bill-men, made it appeare that they could make use of more weapons then one, and after three houres fight the French fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and gave the English leave to take the spoyle of two hundred that were

            <p>The Earle of <hi>Kilmayne</hi> with sixteene hundred Irish, armed after their fashion, came from <hi>Harflew</hi> where they landed, to the King; who were by him assigned for quarter, the North side of the Armie, upon the way that commeth from the Forrest of <hi>Lyons.</hi> This charge the Earle joyfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, <note place="margin">The good service of the <hi>Irish.</hi>

            <p>The Kings Cousin-german, the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> likewise sent a Navy of well appointed Shippes, to the mouth of the River of <hi>Seine,</hi> to stoppe all passage of succour to <hi>Roane.</hi> There were in <hi>Roane,</hi> two hundred and tenne thousand persons, at the beginning of the siege, which made them so confident, that they sware each to other, never to deliver up the Citie as long as they could hold Sword, or handle Pike. The King acquainted here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, stopped all passages, both by land and water, casting deepe Trenches, and raysing Bulwarckes to hinder all sallyes or receipt of reliefe.</p>
            <p>The French in the meane time made many attempts upon divers pieces in the Kings hands, as upon <hi>Kilbuife, Eureux,</hi> and <hi>Loviers,</hi> but were repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with great losse, but more disgrace. Before <hi>Roane</hi> no enterprise is left unpractised, no pollicie unattempted; how either partie might indamage other; But now the many mouthes within the Citie, had devoured a great part of their provision, and for the better saving of the rest, a great number of aged impotent creatures, were turned out of the Gates, whom the English would not suffer to passe the Trenches: betwixt which and the walls the miserable people starved and dyed, without helpe of friend or foe; Vpon Christmasse day, in honour of the birth of our Saviour, the <note place="margin">King <hi>Henryes</hi> charitie.</note> King relieved, and suffered to passe as many as were at first put out, but suffered others that were thrust out a second time to famish, except relieved by the Towne. The unwonted noyse of Bells ringing, gave the King occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to expect an enemie at his backe: for prevention therefore of that danger, hee gave order to Sir <hi>Robert Bapthorpe</hi> Controller of the Army, to provide a deepe Trench well staked, and with bastils to round the Campe, and to make defences both behinde and before, to withstand all sudden approaches: The Famine began now to rage pittifully within the Citie, and the <hi>Dolphins</hi> promise to relieve them, now past hope of performance: a Parlie is desired and obtained, but fruitlesse at the first, the demaunds of the besieged being more then stood with the Kings honour, or pleasure to give consent unto, but upon the Commissioners returne into the Towne, the starved multitude began to upbraid the Commanders, and to tell them, that they must bee famished to death

for their obstinacies, and with threatning speeches, they told them, <note place="margin">Ann. 1418 R. 9.</note> they would, if they would not, compound for their redemption upon any termes, enforced therefore to give way to their implacable furyes, the Commissioners concluded, that after the nineteenth day of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Ianuarie, the Citie and Castle of <hi>Roane</hi> should bee delivered to <note place="margin">

            <p>Vpon the day agreed upon, Sir <hi>Guy de Butler,</hi> and the Burgesses <note place="margin">Surrendred.</note> delivered up the keyes of the Citie and Castle, craving grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.

            <p>The next day after being Friday, the twentieth of Ianuary, the KING triumphantly made his entry, with foure Dukes, tenne Earles, eight Bishops, sixteene Barons, &amp;c. Hee was received with the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, with two and fourty Crosses, and by them was conducted to our Lady Church, where after publicke Thankes-giving, hee tooke homage and fealtie of the Burgesses and inhabitants, making proclamation, that all that would come, and acknowledge him to bee their Liege-Lord, should enjoy the benefit of his protection, and retaine their possessions; whereupon many came in: and many Townes were surrendred.

            <p>The King by land and water stopped all passages, making use of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned floates, to passe his souldiers over the River; yet <hi>Barbason</hi> sallied out, and fell upon the Earle of <hi>Warwickes</hi> quarter, where if hee had not beene the more valiantly resisted; The Duke of <hi>Burgoynes</hi> men had tasted of their fury.

            <p>In the meane time the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> making a road into <hi>Aniou,</hi> with the garrisons of <hi>Normandy,</hi> came to the City of <hi>Ampers,</hi> where hee knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sir <hi>William Rosse,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Goddard,</hi> Sir <hi>Rowland Vider,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Bewford,</hi> his naturall Sonne; And retutning home laden with prey, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised, that the Duke of <hi>Alanson,</hi> intended to intercept his passage; hee therefore sent the skowt-Master <hi>Andrew Fogosa,</hi> to discover the face of the enemy, who being a trecherous <hi>Lombard,</hi> and having beene corrupted by the enemy, at his returne reporteth their number to bee but small, meanly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and worse ordered, so that if presently charged, there could bee no resistance.

These disasters were seconded by the perfidious surrender of many Townes and strong holds to the French King; who now encouraged by these good successes, marched into <hi>Champaigne,</hi> where by Composition hee tooke the chiefe Citie thereof <hi>Troyes, Chaltons</hi> rebelleth, and enforceth <note place="margin">The French every where revolt.</note> their Captaine to yeeld it up; by whose example the Citizens of <hi>Reme</hi> do the like, wherein the French King is a new Proclaimed, &amp; there with accustomed Ceremonies annointed and crowned, and is thereby furthered with the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary submission of many Townes, Castles, strong holds: who from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part sent their subjective messages unto him.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> with tenne thousand English besides <hi>Normans,</hi> marched out of <hi>Paris,</hi> sending Letters of defiance to the French King, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming therein, that hee contrary to the accord, betwixt King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth and King <hi>Charles,</hi> Father to him that was but an usurper, by the instigation of a feminine divell, had taken upon him the Title and dignitie of King of <hi>France,</hi> and by deceitfull and unjust meanes, had surreptitiously stolne (not <note place="margin">The Regent defies the French King.</note> conquered) and kept divers Cities and places of import, belonging to the Crowne of <hi>England;</hi> for legall proofe whereof, by stroke of battaile hee was come into that part, and thereby would justifie his Chartel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The French Kings Councell were resolved, that the only way to weaken <note place="margin">Ann. 1429 Reg. 8.</note> the english, was to disunite the bond of friendship hitherto kept firme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Regent and the Duke of <hi>Burgoine,</hi> to this end are many messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers sent unto him from the French King, whereby hee first laboureth to cleere himselfe of the murther of his Father, next hee maketh large offers of preferments, and assurances of free pardon of all offences past, and his royall promise of love and friendship during life; hereof the Duke certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Regent, but withall giveth him a touch of his unkind denyall of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance</hi> subjection unto him.

            <p>The young King of <hi>England</hi> was by his Councell advised, for it was by them resolved, that his presence would be a good motive, to retain his friends, in their former fidelity, and reduce the backsliders to their sworne allegiance to goe with armed power in person into <hi>France;</hi> To this end upon St. <hi>Georges</hi> eve he took shipping at <hi>Dover,</hi> and landed on Sunday being St. <hi>Georges</hi> day at <hi>Callice,</hi> with a wel-appointed Army, &amp; from thence by easie marches, went <note place="margin">King <hi>Henry</hi> in person go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into <hi>France.</hi>

            <p>It was very observable amongst strangers, and not without some admiration, that so small an Iland as <hi>England,</hi> under the governance of so tender an infant, should so long, and upon so good termes, contend with so large, potent, and populous a kingdome as <hi>France;</hi> But such at that time was the vertue, &amp; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall valour of the English Nation; That they knew no meane betwixt death, and victory, alwayes preferring an honorable death, before a lingring servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.

And upon the receipt of a blancke Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under the French Kings Seale, to insert what Conditions of peace hee would, hee proved renegado, and falsified his faith to <hi>England,</hi> lost his reputation to the world, and sold himselfe slave to perpetuall ignomy.</p>

            <p>The Kings facile nature, and flexible condition, was the occasion that many enormities encreased, and many things made worse, that might have beene better, if observed, and stopt in the beginning.

            <p>Some affirme, that the English had grasped more with their hand, then they could well hold, joyning more Townes then they could man, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more lands then they could manure, so that their store bred their pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Others say, that the Captaines kept not halfe the number in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, that they received pay for: Others affirme, that <hi>Somerset</hi> was blinded with French-crowne dust, that hee could not discerne danger, till the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers tasted destruction; But it is most agreeable to truth, that the triple-headed <hi>Gerion</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> presumption in government, by some unmeet to rule, the inveterate malice, and insufferable pride of the last created Nobilitie, and the universall distaste of the Commons, too much oppressed with exactions, and burdens, was the originall and finall cause of the ill successe our Armies had in <hi>France.</hi> Yet by the way consider, but the deportment of the English Nation, the concurrence of martiall men their counsell, discipline, designes, from the beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the first untill this time, and you will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that they were men of worth and prowes, and caried the palme of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory before them wheresoever they went.

            <p>In the meane time all meanes possiblie are used, to stop the mouthes of those that were incensed against the Duke, but it prevailed not. For the Lower house exhibited their Bill of grievance against the Duke of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> to this purpose;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That hee traiterously had incited divers the Kings enemies, as namely the Bastard of <hi>Orleance,</hi> the Lord <hi>Presigny</hi> and others, to levie warre against the King, to the intent that thereby the King might bee destroyed, and that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Duke of <hi>Suffolkes</hi> Son, who had taken to Wife <hi>Margaret</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and sole heire of <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> whose Title to the Crowne, the Duke of <hi>Suffolke</hi> had often declared, in case King <hi>Henry</hi> should die without issue, might be King.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That by his sinister practises, <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7754:80"/>
the many cautions upon great reasons, by King <hi>Henry</hi> the fift to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary given, obtained his liberty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That through his trecherie by the abetment of the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> the French King hath gotten possession of all the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and taken prisoners, the valiant Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> the Lord <hi>Fauconbridge,</hi> and many other brave Commanders; But to all these, hee affirmed himselfe not guilty, neither in thought or deed.</p>
            <p>Then was further allegations made against him, to this purpose.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That being with others sent Embassadours into <hi>France,</hi> hee transcended his Commission, and without privitie of his fellow Commissioners, presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to promise the surrender of <hi>Anion,</hi> and the deliuery of the Countie of <hi>Maunts,</hi> and the Citie of <hi>Mants</hi> to Duke <hi>Rayner,</hi> which accordingly was performed, to the great dishonour of the King, and detriment of the Crowne.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That hee had traiterously acquainted the Councell of the French King with all the affaires of State, and passages of secrecie, by whose trayterous information, the enemy was througly instructed, in all the designes of the King and Councell.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That hee had received rewards from the French King, whereby all succours sent to the Kings Friends in <hi>France,</hi> were disappointed and frustrate.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That by his wicked practises, the good Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> was depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved both of Protectorship and life.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That by his labouring, such only were made of the Kings privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, that more respected the Dukes particular profits, then the good of the King or Realme.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And lastly, that hee had underhand fraudulently enriched himselfe with the Kings Treasure and revenewes, and had possessed himselfe, by abusing the Queenes favour, of all Offices of charge and credit about the King. All these hee faintly denyed, but could not acquit himselfe of them. But to bleare the eyes of the people, and to keepe them hoodwinckt during the time of Parliament. The Duke is committed to the Tower, but the Parliament is no sooner dissolved, but hee is set at liberty, which so much incensed the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar <note place="margin">

They fell to an insurrection, and under the leading of a desperate Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; stiling himselfe <hi>Blewbeard,</hi> they began to commit some outrages, but by the diligence of the Gentlemen of the Country, the Captaine was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the rebellion ceased.</p>
            <p>The Parliament is againe assembled, and great care taken of the Election, of moderate-minded men, for Citizens and Burgesses, presuming thereby to <note place="margin">A Parliament summoned.</note> stop any further proceedings against <hi>Suffolke;</hi> But his appearance gave such a generall distaste in the House, that though hee came in the company of the King and Queen, they would not forbeare, but begin the assembly with Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the King for exemplary punishment, to be inflicted upon such, that had plotted or consented to the dishonourable release, and resignation of <hi>Anion</hi> and <hi>Mayne,</hi> whereof by name they did instance the Duke of <hi>Suffolke, Iohn Bishop</hi> of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> Sir <hi>Iames Fynes,</hi> Lord <hi>Say,</hi> and others. This Petition was seconded by the Lords of the upper House; whereupon to give some satisfaction to the Houses, the Lord <hi>Say</hi> Lord Treasurer, is sequestred from
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7754:80"/>
his place. The Dukes Offices are all discarded, and himselfe formally bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed for five yeares, but with an intent, after the multitude (which are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgetfull of what is not ever in sight) had put out of mind, the hatred conceived against him, to have revoked him; But God did otherwise dispose of him; For when hee was shipped in <hi>Suffolke,</hi> with intent to have wasted over into <hi>France,</hi> hee was met by an English man of Warre, taken and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Dover</hi> Sands, had there his head chopt off, on the side of the long boat, which together with the body were left there on the sands, as a pledge of some satisfaction for the death of <hi>Humphry.</hi> This <hi>William de la Poole</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Alice</hi> Daughter and heire of Sir <hi>Tomas Chaucer,</hi> who had issue by her <hi>Iohn,</hi> who succeeded him and <hi>William.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst these things are in agitation, the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> though in <hi>Ireland,</hi> began to spread his nets in <hi>England,</hi> to catch such as either through disgraces were discontented, or otherwise envious, at the unworthy preferment of ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserving persons, or such as were any way ill-affected with the present go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ever suggesting by the way his Title to the Crowne, as descended from <hi>Philip</hi> Daughter and heire of <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> great Grandfather of <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt. Then is it pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly whispered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the King was simplie of a weake capacitie.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Queene incorrigibly ambitious.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Privie Councell if wise, yet not honest enough for their places.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That through their inabilities, all <hi>France</hi> was lost; And that God would not blesse the usurped possession of King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt.</p>
            <p>Amongst others that were caught with these reportative engines; The Kentishmen swallowed downe the hooke, and are taken therewith, which being observed by an Instrument of the Duke of <hi>Yorkes</hi> called <hi>Mortimer:</hi> he <note place="margin">

            <p>The people are so taken with these promises of reformation, and freedome of impositions, that they draw to a head, and make <hi>Mortymer,</hi> otherwise <hi>Iacke Cade</hi> their Leader, who stiling himselfe Captaine <hi>Mend-all,</hi> marcheth with no great number, but those well-ordered to <hi>Black-heath,</hi> where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Eltham</hi> and <hi>Greenwich,</hi> hee lay by the space of a moneth exercising his men, and sending for whom hee pleased, and for what he pleased, in that majestick manner, as if hee were Lord Paramount of all <hi>Kent,</hi> nay of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> also: To him resort fresh Companies of all sorts, and from all parts.

And first whereas it was generally voiced; That the Countie of <hi>Kent</hi> should be depopulated, and made a wild Forrest, for the death of the Duke of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> they justifie their innocency of the fact, and therefore crave the aversion of any such sentence, or decree, Then they make remonstrance.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

The next morning they marched to <hi>London-bridge,</hi> where they made shift with their swords to cut the ropes of the draw bridge, no force being used for resistance, and so in good order they march by London stone, vpon which the Captaine strooke his sword, saying, Loe <hi>Mortymer</hi> is now Lord of London: The Maior of London. Sir <hi>Thomas Chalton,</hi> standing upon the threshold of his doore, with a bold countenance, as though he had power enough (if he would) to represse him, told the Captaine that if he should attempt any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the quiet of the City, that he should feele hands enough about their eares to stop them, before they went too farre, whereunto <hi>Iacke Cade</hi> not permitting him to proceed with a setled brow, sayd.

This orderly carriage of himselfe with the care of the Commanders to keepe the men in obedience, to the statutes and provisions of their Generall, wonne them a good opinion amongst the most of the lower ranke of Citizens, he therefore assuming to himselfe, the

            <p>Vpon Cocks admission he had private conference with three other with him: and the Captaine at his departure gave him these instructions in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>You shall charge all <hi>Lombards,</hi> and Merchant strangers, <hi>Genowayes, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, Florentines</hi> and others, This day to draw themselves together; And to ordaine for us the Captaine, twelve harnesse compleat of the best fashion, foure and twenty Brigandines, twelve battell Axes, twelve glaves, six hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with saddle and bridle compleatly furnished, and a thousand markes in ready money; And if this our demand bee not performed and done, wee shall have the heads of as many as wee can get of them.</p>
            <p>Next morning being the third of Iuly, having received the <hi>Lombards</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, hee returned in battell array to <hi>London,</hi> and from thence sent to the Lord <hi>Scales</hi> for the bringing of his prisoner the Lord <hi>Say</hi> to the <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> whither hee had called the Maior with his brethren, and before whom hee caused the Lord <hi>Say</hi> to bee arraigned, who craved the benefit of the Law, to bee tried by his Peeres, was forth with taken from his Keepers, and brought to the Standard in Cheap, and there had his head chopt off, which being pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched upon a Pike, was carried before him to <hi>Mile-end,</hi> whither hee went to have conference with the Mutiners of <hi>Essex,</hi> which were encamped there, by the way casually meeting with Sir <hi>Iames Cromer,</hi> the high Sheriffe of Kent, who had lately married the Lord <hi>Sayes</hi> Daughter, hee caused his head to bee strucke off, and carried with his Father-in-Lawes before him in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision; From thence hee returned into <hi>Southwarcke,</hi> and orderly kept his watches, tying the Companies to their martiall duties.</p>
            <p>In the morning they came againe to <hi>London,</hi> where after publick execution made of some of his followers that had done things contrary to his Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for hee made the transgression of his Edicts criminall, without the least partialitie, or sparing any, upon some displeasure formerly taken, against Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman <hi>Malpas,</hi> hee sent and seized upon all his Wares and goods, and sent it to his quarter in <hi>Southwarcke,</hi> and fined Alderman <hi>Horne</hi> at five hundred Markes, and began in a more insolent manner then hitherto hee had used to beare himselfe, which caused the graver Citizens, to take advise amongst themselves, for some speedy course to be taken, for the repressing of these insolencies, and the assurance of their lives and substance, from the fury of such Rebells. They send therefore by night to the Lord <hi>Scales,</hi> who promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them his best assistance, and to that end sendeth to them <hi>Mathew Gough</hi> an old souldier, and an able Captaine, with some forces and furnitures out of the Tower; who presently are drawne downe to <hi>London</hi> Bridge, and at the foot thereof, stand to debarre the Kentish rebells from passage that way; whereupon the alarum is given, and <hi>Cade</hi> endevoured to force his passage, so that a cruell fight began, which did continue many houres, sometimes joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, sometime losing ground, at length the Rebells prevailed so farre, that they drove the <hi>Londoners</hi> from the draw-bridge; then they began to set fire
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7754:83"/>
on the houses, when the aged and impotent, betweene the mercilesse ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of fire and water, (whilst the more able were slaine by the sword most miserablie perished, Captaine <hi>Bough</hi> Alderman, <hi>Sutton</hi> and <hi>Robert Haysand,</hi> valiantly fighting were slaine, now had the Londoners lost the Bridge, and were driven to S. <hi>Magnus</hi> corner, but a fresh supplie being come, they recouered the Bridge, and droue the Kentish beyond the stoope in <hi>Southwarke,</hi> at which time both being weary agreed of a truce, untill the next day, neither partie to goe into the others quarters, after the retreate <hi>Cade</hi> found that he had lost, many of his most able men, he was therefore driven for supplie, to set at liberty all the prisoners in <hi>Southwarke,</hi> aswell fellones as debtors, to fill up his number, but now his Souldiers, entring into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, of their danger, and the desparate services their Captaine had brought them to, and though which the latest advising privately amongst themselves of some Course, to retyre and returne to their houses and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, being weary of the life of a Souldier, they hung downe their heads only wayted but opportunity to give their Captaine the bag, which being wisely apprehended, by the Lord Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> collecting by their Countenances their change of opinion, he together with the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> came from the Towen by water to <hi>Southwarke,</hi> where they shewed the kings Generall pardon, under the great seale of <hi>England,</hi> which being publickly published, the people were not more weary of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling then glad of the pardon, and without bidding the Captaine farewell, they that night withdrew themselves, to their severall habitation, <hi>Iack Cade</hi> having sent his pillage by water, with some few followers, bent his joureney to <hi>Quinborough</hi> Castle, where contrary to expectation, being debarred entrance he disguised himselfe and privily fled, but Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being made, that he that should bring him alive, or dead, should have for his reward a thousand Markes, he was afterward by one <hi>Alexander Eden</hi> Gentleman, attached, but making resistance in a Garden at <hi>Hoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> in <hi>Sussex</hi> he was slaine, his body was brought to London, and there beheaded and quartered, the one placed on London Bridge, the other sent <note place="margin">The captaine of the rebells slaine.</note> into diuers places in <hi>Kent,</hi> to be set up: upon this newes the King sends his Commissioners into <hi>Kent,</hi> to enquire of the abettors of the Kentish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, whither himselfe followeth in person, and notwithstanding five hundred were found guiltie, eight only were executed. The slippes of this rebellion, did spring about this time, in many places of this kingdome, but chiefly, in <hi>Sussex Surry</hi> and <hi>Wilshire,</hi> but were soone appeased without much hurt done, only the <hi>Wilshire</hi> men upon the nine and twenteth day of <hi>Iune,</hi> drew <hi>William Askots</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> from the high altar ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating <note place="margin">The Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> murthered.</note> Masse in <hi>Edington</hi> Church, in his albe with his stole about his necke, to the top of the hill, and their inhumanly murdered him. Their rage having blinded their reason, banisht humanitie, and drowned all pitty, they stripped him naked, every one of his tenants striving to have a peece of his bloody shirt, not as others to have the relikes of the Martyr, to celebrate his memory, but as glorying in their owne villany, they having the day before robbed his carriage and taken the sum of ten thousand marks. The French King taking hold of these disorders in <hi>England,</hi> winneth out of their hands, all whatsoever was in their possession in <hi>France,</hi> no succour, though often, and earnestly by writing, and Messengers required, being sent unto them, so that <hi>England</hi> at this time suffred a totall eclipse of glory in <hi>France,</hi> They every day loosing more or lesse, untill they had nothing left in <hi>France</hi> to loose, but the Towne of <hi>Callice,</hi> and the Castles of <hi>Hames</hi>

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> having so well discharged his place of Regency, that hee had lost but few men, but consumed much Treasure, and kept never a Towne, commeth into <hi>England,</hi> and at a Parliament, which began at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>

            <p>To this the King maketh answer, that hee would take his complaint of wrongs into consideration, and endevour to give him faire satisfaction; but withall somewhat blames him, for the death of the Bishop of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> by his meanes suspected to bee slaughtered, and of dangerous spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, uttered by his servants tending to rebellion; concluding that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any thing said, or done to the contrary: he did take and esteeme him as a faithfull subject, and a loving kinsman.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> not herewith satisfied, intending at once both to promulgate his protestation, and display his colours, departeth into <hi>Wales,</hi>

And how much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is at this time offended with his government, wee may well feare if wee but call to mind the cruell butchering of so many honourable great Lords, in defence of his title abroad, the slaughter of so many thousand of his loyall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in maintenance of his quarrell, the inutterable exhaust of the treasure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarily consumed in <hi>France, Normandy,</hi> and else-where; The civil broiles at home, the losse of all formerly got in <hi>France</hi> and those parts, the losse occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by the excursion and depredations of the Scots and French. And lastly, the oppressions, extortions, and violence daily unsufferably practised by the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of an insolently ambitious woman, upon the meaner sort of people; And then concluded, that he craved no favour from them, except that justice did warrant his claime, nor would expect or desire the possession of the Crowne, except his descent were undisputable, and his Title without just exception, and for his owne particular he presumed that since vertue might be as bold to challenge its due: as vice is apt to borrow of insinuation: he might without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence put in his claime, and demand allowance thereof. This being a businesse of import, required deliberation, and mature consideration; but in conclusion, the Duke having before hand by his agents prepared the Lords Spirituall, and few of the Nobilitie present, that were not on his part, the Burgesses were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily perswaded, and that was generally resolved, and enacted accordingly; That King <hi>Henry</hi> during his life should retaine the name and honour of a King; That the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> should be proclaimed Heire apparant to the <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> to be proclaimed heire to the Crowne, and Protector.</note> Crowne, and the Protector of the Kings person, his Land, Dominions, and Country; That at any time, any King <hi>Henryes</hi> Friends, Allies, or Favourites in his behalfe, should attempt the disanulling of this act, that then the Duke should have present possession of the Crowne.</p>
            <p>No sooner was the Parliament dissolved, when the Duke dispatcheth Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into <hi>Scotland,</hi> requiring in the Kings name, the Queene, the Dukes of <hi>Somerset</hi> and <hi>Exceter,</hi> and all other of the Nobilitie that remained in that

               </note> from the Market place with such a showre of arrowes, that they were for safeguard glad to retire, and sought to passe by another way, which (but not without some blowes) they did: and encountred with their enemies in the field, who perceiving the maine battaile to stand and not to move, by the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of <hi>Lonelace,</hi> who with the Kentish men led the Van. the Southerne men turned afide and fled, and by the Northerne prickers were slaughtered untill night saved their backes; When night was come, the residue despairing of each others well-meaning, shifted away; The Nobles about the King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving how the game went, withdrew themselves. The Lord <hi>Bonvile,</hi> comming in a complementall manner to the King, saying, It grieved him to <note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Bonvile</hi> and <hi>Thomas Kiryell</hi> beheaded by the Queene, contrary to the Kings promise.</note> leave his Majestie, but necessitie for safeguard of his life enforced it, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned, and Sir <hi>Thomas Kiryell</hi> like wise by the King to stay, hee passing his royall word, that their stay should not endanger their bodyes; upon which promise they stayed, but to their cost, for such was the inplacable fury of the Queen, that hearing Baron <hi>Thorpe</hi> was by the Commons beheaded at <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> she the day after the battell, being Ashwednesday, caused both their heads to bee smitten off at Saint <hi>Albones,</hi> whose death reckoned with the

            <p>The King was advised to send one <hi>Thomas Hoe,</hi> that had beene a Barrester to the Victors, to thanke them for their paines, and to tell them that hee would gladly come to them, if with convenience it might be done. The Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> appointed divers Lords, to attend him to the Lord <hi>Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> Tent, where the Queene and young Prince met to their great joy, it <note place="margin">30.

At the Queenes request, he honored with the order of Knighthood, thirty that the day before fought against the part where hee was, the Prince likewise was by him dubbed Knight; Then they went to the Abby, where they were entertained with Anthems, and withall, an humble Petition to be taken into the Kings protection, thereby to bee freed from the tiranny of the loose souldiers, which was promised, and Proclamation accordingly made, but to small purpose, for the Northerne men said, it was made in their bargaine, to haveall the spoyle in every place, after they had passed the River of <hi>Trent,</hi> and so they robbed and spoyled all they could come at, which gave <note place="margin">The Families of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished by the red Rose and white.</note> just cause of dislike to the indifferent-minded, which only wisht the quiet, and peace of the Country, not respecting which Rose, the red or white pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, for now began that distinction by those Badges, for the factions of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi> to bee worne.</p>
            <p>The Londoners hearing of this disorder, were warned to looke to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and they were resolved, since there was no more assurance in the Kings promise, to keepe the Northerne men out of their gates; The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and tendernesse of a King, not accompanied with courage and severitie, is both hurtfull to himselfe and his estate.</p>
            <p>In the Kings name the Londoners are sent to, to send over to the Campe, certaine Cart-loades of Lenton provision; The Maior accordingly provides, and makes all things ready, but the Commons (rose about <hi>Cripplegate,</hi> and by strong hand, say, or doe what the Maior or his officers can; they kept the Carts from going forth of the Citie; The Maior sends the Recorder to the Kings Councell, and knowing the predominancy of the Queenes passion, if never so little troubled, they entreat the Dutchesse of <hi>Bedford</hi> and the Lady <hi>Scales,</hi> with all the Fathers of the Church resiant about <hi>London,</hi> to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for him, and excuse his not using force, considering how apt the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude was to take fire upon the least flash, and how dangerous it might bee in these doubtfull times, to raise their fury, that would not easily bee allayed, it was well advised, to send women to entreat women, for they so prevailed, That some of the Lords of the Councell, with a guard of foure hundred good souldiers, were appointed to goe for <hi>London,</hi> to enquire and certifie the truth of these things; But before they set forth, divers Northerne men, that long looked to have the ransacking of <hi>London,</hi> came unto the gates, and would have entred, had not the Citizens valiantly repelled them, and with the slaughter of some three or foure, they were sent to carry word to the Campe, that the Earle of <hi>March,</hi> with a great Army was marching towards them, neither was it a fiction; For at <hi>Chipping-Norton</hi> by <hi>Cotsall,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> having drawne together, as many of his scattered troopes, as hee could find, met with the earle of <hi>March,</hi> and his victorious troopes, which being joyned, they hasted towards <hi>London,</hi> and were joyfully received, upon the eight and twentieth day of Februarie, and upon Sunday the second of March, the Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> mustered all this Army in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> fields, and having cast them in a ring, the Leader read unto them the agreement of the last Parliament,

And being perswaded that no other meanes would serue for direction of his claime but the sword, he resolued to set up his rest, and by battaile to give a certaine determination to the question.</p>
            <p>Vpon the twelfth of <hi>March,</hi> his forces marched from <hi>London,</hi> and by <note place="margin">Edward <hi>lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth</hi> London.</note> easie journeys came to <hi>Pomfret</hi> Castle, where he rested, and from thence the Lord <hi>Eitz-walter,</hi> with some companies was sent by him to guard the passage, at <hi>Ferry-brigg,</hi> to stop the enemies approch that way.

            </p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> very early, on <hi>Palme Saterday</hi> in the morning, with a troope of <hi>Northerne Prickers,</hi> falls upon those that had the guard of the <note place="margin">Lord <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walter</hi> slaine at <hi>Ferry-brig.</hi>
               </note> passage at <hi>Ferry-brig,</hi> and defeated them, with the slaughter of the Lord <hi>Fitzwalter</hi> and the bastard of <hi>Salisbury:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> hearing of this defeate, postes to the Earle of <hi>March</hi> his Campe, and in his presence killing his horse, said; Sir I pray God have mercy on their soules which in the beginning of your enterprise, have for your love lost there lives. The enemie hath won the passage at <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rybrigg,</hi> There is no hope now but in God: yet let him flye, that will flye: when (kissing the Crosse of his sword,) he sayd by this good signe I will stand by him that will stand by me, fall backe, fall edge.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>March</hi> no whit amated but somewhat moved with <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicks</hi> resolution, presently made Proclamation, that all such of his company, <note place="margin">1461.</note> as were unwilling to stay; or afraid to fight, should at their pleasure depart. But to those that would abide, he promised good reward; Adding withall that if any that stayed, should after turne his backe, or flee: That he that should kill such a Changeling should have double pay.</p>
            <p>Then gave he order to the Lord <hi>Fauconbridge</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Blunt</hi> to lead on the <hi>Vowarde,</hi> who in their March about <hi>Dindingdale</hi> encountred with the Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> (who formerly in cold blood had slaugtered the young Earle of <hi>Rutland)</hi> him with <hi>Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Nevill,</hi> sonne and heire of the Earle <note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> slaine.</note> of <hi>Westmerland</hi> they slew with most of their companies; putting the rest to flight.</p>
            <p>The next day likewise (the Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> being dangerously sicke to whom that place was assigned) <hi>Fauconbridge</hi> and <hi>Blunt</hi> continue the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the vantguard. And on <hi>Palme-Sunday</hi> by breake of day they came to <hi>Saxton,</hi> from whence they made a full survay of King <hi>Henryes</hi> army, and certified the Earle of <hi>March</hi> that the enemie was threescore thousand strong: whereupon a second, Proclamation was made through the Campe, That no quarter should be kept, nor prisoner taken (a Course more savoring, of policie then <hi>Religion)</hi> yet by so much the more excusable, by how much his number was so far short of his adversarie.</p>
            <p>The armies being both in sight, The Lord <hi>Fauconbridge</hi> gave direction to the bowmen upon a signall by him to be given, to shoot every man a flight arrow, (for that purpose provided) and then to fall backe three strides and stand, which they accordingly did. The Notherne men hereupon plied their bowes, untill their sheaves were empty. But all their arrowes fell short of the marke, and turned to their owne disadvantage; For their arrowes being spent, hasting to ioyne to come to hand-blowes; Their owne

            <p>From <hi>Yorke</hi> he posteth to <hi>Lancaster,</hi> where his Chamberlaine the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> had raised some forces, with those he marcheth to <hi>London,</hi> the love of whose Citizens he mainly relied upon, and thereof found himselfe not deceived, for they with willing readinesse receive him.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>VVarwick</hi> having information of what was past, makes a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of necessitie, and dispatches letters and Messengers to all his friends and confederates to draw to an head, which they accordingly did. But by the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest solicitation and industry of those good patriots which before had labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have the sword of civill dissention sheathed. Now an interview (Vpon interchange of oathes for safety and faire returne on both sides) is had betwixt the king, the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> and the Earle of <hi>VVarwicke</hi> in <hi>VVest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster-Hall.</hi> But the Earle like one endevoring to infect the ayre takes poyson into his mouth and spits it into the wind, makes repetition of former courtesies done to <hi>Edward,</hi> and for requitall thereof, indignities returned, which with such peremptory phrase he urged that they savoured so much of exprobration, that the King unable to endure such harsh, &amp; ill-becomming language from a subject, in a scornefull fury, departed the Hall, and went to <hi>Canterbury.</hi> And the Duke and Earle to <hi>Lincolne,</hi> whither they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed their powers to repayre, under the conduct of Sir <hi>Robert VVells</hi> sonne and heire of the Lord <hi>VVells,</hi> a valiant Gentleman and of approved sufficiency.</p>
            <p>The King with intent to take off Sir <hi>Robert</hi> from <hi>VVarwicks</hi> part, sends for <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>VVells,</hi> who with his brother in Law, Sir <hi>Thomas Dymock</hi> 
               <note place="margin">An. 1470 R. 10.</note> comming to attend the kings pleasure, received information from some of their friends in Court, that the King was much incensed against them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Wells</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mock</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed.</note> they take Sanctuary at <hi>VVestminster.</hi> From whence upon the kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of generall pardon, they came to his presence, who gave command to the Lord <hi>VVells,</hi> effectually by letter to solicite his son Sir <hi>Robert VVells,</hi> to leave the Earle of <hi>VVarwick,</hi> &amp; come to the kings service, which was accordingly done, but because it procured not desired effect, the king not without blemish to his Honor, in his rage caused both their heads to be strooke off. The report wherof, so enraged the young knight that no perswasion could prevaile with him to abide the Earle of <hi>VVarwicks</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, which was every day expected but passion having blinded his judgement, led on by fury &amp; the inevitablenes of his fate, he with his forces charged the kings army. And whilest he laboured to go beyond man in doing, (his valour not checkt by discretion) he proves lesse then a sucking child, and for sinking under an oppressing multitude, he

was taken prisoner, which so discouraged his men that they fled, and the <note place="margin">Ann. 1470 R. 10.</note> lighter to runne away, they cast of their coates. And thereby gave a name unto the place from whence they fled, which ever since hath beene called Loose Coate field, in this place were slaine of the Earles part ten thousand, and odde, of the Kings side thirteen hundred but no man of marke. <note place="margin">Loose <hi>Coate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</hi>

            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Wells,</hi> with all the prisoners then taken were there presently executed, Sir <hi>Robert</hi> beheaded, the other hanged, which were threescore &amp; seven.</p>
            <p>The report of this disaster, turnes <hi>Clarence,</hi> and his father in Law to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceter,</hi> from whence having dismist their army, they fled to <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> from thence they shipped to <hi>Callis,</hi> having their Ladyes and divers Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in their Company, intending there to goe on shore, but their expectation was frustrated, for whilst he was about to land, he was saluted with a great shot from the platforme, which assured them there was no going on shoare there, without apparant danger, whereupon the Earle by messenger entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Mounseir Vocleer,</hi> the Earles Deputie leiftenant there. But to give way to the Ladyes to land (the Dutchesse of <hi>Clarence</hi> being then in travaile) which <hi>Vocleer</hi> uncourteously refused, and like the hedghog kept his Captaine out of his owne lodging; not doing or permitting to be done any the least office of humanitie, but denying the sicke and tender Ladies all courtesie and comfort, wherefore the Earle was enforced to put againe to Sea. Whilst King <hi>Edward,</hi> for this so discourteous usage of the Earle sent the ungratefull <hi>Gascoyne</hi> a patent of the Captaines place of <hi>Callice</hi> under the great Seale of <hi>England.</hi> And the Duke of <hi>Burgoyne</hi> gave him an annuitie of one hundred pounds per annum during life.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding <hi>Warwick</hi> being at Sea, received intelligence from <hi>Vocleer</hi> (whom it seemes did love the Earle in the second place but himselfe in the first) That the Duke of <hi>Burgoine</hi> plotted his destruction, whereupon the Earle kept the Seas: and tooke all the <hi>Burgonians</hi> he cold meet, making <note place="margin">

And there the Ladies wants are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and honorable welcome, and liberall entertainment given to the Earle and all his company.</p>
            <p>The newes of the Earle of <hi>Warwickes</hi> being at the French Kings Court drew thither Queene <hi>Margaret</hi> and her sonne <hi>Edward</hi> with <hi>Iasper</hi> late <note place="margin">Visited by Queene <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet.</hi>

From henceforth underhand he gives perfect intelligence to King <hi>Edward</hi> of all proceedings against him, and withall assures him, that he was resolved upon his comming into <hi>England,</hi> to play the part of a loving Brother, and as hee did now in heart, decline the confederation, so he would then cleane desert their cause: herewith when King <hi>Edward</hi> acquainted his Brother the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> hee said hee alwayes thought as much, for hee that at one time had turned Traitour to his Soveraigne, would at another prove trecherous to his friend; but wee may (saith he) presume better here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after of our Brother.</p>
            <p>The French King having furnished the new Confederates with men, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and amunition, and with necessary shipping; They all went aborde, and falling downe to the mouth of the river of <hi>Seyne;</hi> they descried the <hi>Burgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> with a strong fleet prepared to interrupt their sayling forth; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Lords strike sayle and call to Councell; But during their time of such consultation, a strong Southwest wind comes from land, with a terrible tempest of raine, by fury whereof the <hi>Burgonian</hi> Fleet was driven to Sea and severed, many of them being driven on ground in <hi>Scotland;</hi> The storme <note place="margin">The <hi>Burgoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Fleet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed.</note> being ceased, having set the Queene and Prince with his Wife on shore, <hi>Warwicke</hi> with his Complices hoise sayle, and with a merry gale, arrive safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> from whence hee gave notice to his partakers of his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall.

            <p>The Marquesse <hi>Mountacute,</hi> whose actions and carriage were alwayes reserved and obscure from the vulgar, yea so disputable and doubtfull amongst his owne Brothers and Allyes; That none but himselfe could expatiate them; Hee now when hee had power sufficient to doe it, did not impeach King <hi>Edwards</hi> passage about <hi>Pomfret,</hi> but suffered him to passe by him not fought with, for which hee was much condemned by his Brother and deservedly, for had <hi>Edward</hi> beene then but a little shaken, hee had dyed at roote; Being come to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> divers of the Nobilitie came to him, making tender of their service, but with this proviso, that hee would resolutely take upon him, the stile and Title of King, and accordingly take his State, which hee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much contradiction was contented (his former oath to the contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no scruple to his conscience) to consent unto; And as a river running farre from its first rising, is still augmented by the accesse of other brookes and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters falling into it, so King <hi>Enwards</hi> Army encreased by marching onward to a great number.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> upon notice of these proceedings, leaving King <hi>Henry</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> hasted towards his Towne of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> from whence he sent to the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> to advertise him of these occurrences, desiring his speedy accesse thither, where hee would abide his comming; But the Duke lingring out the time, and made not that speed that was expected, and the businesse in hand required, which gave cause of suspition of his tergiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; <note place="margin">

            <p>The resolution was equall on both parts, to set up their rests upon the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of that encounter upon Easter eve the King with his power lodged in <hi>Barnet</hi> towne, the Earle of <hi>VVarwicke</hi> encamped upon the hill betweene Saint <hi>Albones</hi> and <hi>Barnet,</hi> the Campes each in sight of other.</p>
            <p>Early on Easter day in the morning (an unfit day chosen for so unpleasing a service to God,) The souldiers on both sides are put in array; The Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> appointed the command of the right wing which consisted of horse, to his Brother the Marquesse <hi>Mountacute</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Oxford;</hi> The least wing likewise consisting of horse, was led by the Duke of <hi>Exceter;</hi> and the battell consisting of Bills and Bowes, was conducted by the Duke of <hi>Somerset.</hi>

            <p>On King <hi>Edwards</hi> part was slaine no man of extraordinary note, but the Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> Sonne and heire of the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Barnes,</hi> Sonne and heire of the Lord <hi>Say.</hi>

            <p>Queene <hi>Margaret</hi> when it was too late, with some French forces, landed at <hi>Waymouth,</hi> where having unwelcome tidings of this disastes, znd that the Duke of <hi>Excester</hi> supposed slaine, was strangely recovered, and had taken Sanctuary at <hi>Westminster,</hi> shee with her Sonne conveyed her selse to <hi>Bewly</hi> in <hi>Hampshire,</hi> where shee tooke Sanctuary, having sent her souldiers into <hi>Wales</hi> to <hi>Jasper</hi> Earle of <hi>Penbrooke,</hi> who with the Duke of <hi>Somerset, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Courtney</hi> Earle of <hi>Devon.

This King <hi>Henry</hi> in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time had beene so truly a participant of both prosperitie and adversitie, That few can goe beyond him in both, if any his Predecessours could paralell him in either, being nine moneths old hee began his raigne over <hi>England,</hi> being wisely, warily, and watchfully, guided, guarded, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded by his three, wise, valiant, and respective Vncles, the Dukes of <hi>Gloucester, Exceter,</hi> and <hi>Bedford,</hi> as long as their triple twisted, triumvirate authority subsisted; In the eighth yeare of his Raigne hee was Crowned at <hi>Westminster;</hi> And in the eleventh yeare of his Raigne, hee was Crowned King of <hi>France,</hi> in our Lady Church at <hi>Paris;</hi> Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares hee enjoyed all the benefits of peace within <hi>England,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manifest interruption; And what content a bucksome and debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naire Queene could enrich him with; But in the three and thirtieth yeare of his Raigne hee was enforced to fight, after a great defeat gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him at Saint <hi>Albones;</hi> And in the eight and thirtieth yeare of his Raigne, his Armie was defeated at <hi>Northampton</hi> by great <hi>Warwicke,</hi> and there by him taken Prisoner: The yeare following hee is by Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> his Wife set at libertie, but in the same yeare after the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw given him at <hi>Mortimers</hi> Crosse, both hee and his Queene were compelled to flye out of the Realme the one to <hi>Scotland,</hi> the other into <hi>France.</hi> Hee is afterwards taken Prisoner at <hi>Selby</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and brought Prisoner to the Tower, from whence hee shortly delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and restored by him that first tooke him Prisoner, and last left him there (great <hi>Warwicke)</hi> for his sake. <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth is compelled to fly for ayde into <hi>Holland,</hi> and is Proclaimed Traytour, whilst <hi>Henry</hi> againe is Vested in royaltie; But the yeare following hee is againe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Prisoner in the Bishops Pallace at <hi>London,</hi> and sent Prisoner to the Tower, for whose releasement whilst <hi>Warwicke</hi> strives, both himselfe and Brother lose their lives at the field fought at <hi>Barnet,</hi> and young Prince <hi>Edward</hi> upon the same occasion is murdered after the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe given to his Mother at <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> besides many of the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all blood, and his Noble friends massacred and butchered in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet hee in both estates so demeaned himselfe, that hee modestly carried the one, and moderately underwent the other, Passion at no time drowning his judgement, nor will at any time domineering over his Reason; yea, such was his deportment, that the inconstancie of his state could not alter the constancy of his minde; Insomuch that one of his Successours King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, laboured for that only vertue, to have Canonized to be a Saint, and had obtained to have had it done, had not the charges thereof so farre exceeded mediocrity, for the (fees or expences to make a King a Saint are much more then the expences to Canonize a Clergie man) caused him to leave it undone, so that for want of one to disburse the money King HENRY lost a Feast day, and his name a place in the Almanacke, it is most evident his integritie of life was such, that his
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7754:104"/>
Confessour a grave and reverend Doctor confidently avouched, That in tenne yeares together, in all which time hee monethly at least received his Confession, hee never could gather, that hee had in thought, word, or deed, committed that, that in his thought might deserve the injunction of penance.</p>
            <p>His continencie was such, that before his marriage, hee would permit no Woman, to have any thing to doe in his Chamber, nor ever would touch woman, but by way of orderly salutation, and that so seldome, that it was taken for a great grace to them so by him saluted.</p>
            <p>At a Christmasse time a Maske of Women being presented unto him, whereof some of them showed there (at this day too commonly used) naked breasts, hee left the presence, crying, Fie, fie, Ladyes, in sooth you are to blame, to bare those parts to the eye of man, that nature appointed mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie to conceale.</p>
            <p>Hee was so farre from Vindicative disposition of injuries, or affronts offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his Person, that hee would give thankes to God, that did so permit men to punish his transgressions in this life, that so hee might escape the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for them hereafter.</p>
            <p>Hee was so watchfull over his words, that he was never heard to sweare oath, his greatest and most earnest asseveration, being for the most part, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth, forsooth, or Verely, verely.</p>
            <p>Hee was so farre from Covetousnesse, that when the Executours of his Vncle (stiled the rich Bishop of <hi>Winchester)</hi> made offer unto him of two thousand pounds of free gift, hee refused it, wishing them to take care of orderly performance of their dutie, in duly accomplishing the Testatours Will, and not to consume the estate left them for better uses in bribery, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary donations.</p>
            <p>Hee was so religiously affected, that hee duly observed his Canonicall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the strictest injunction of the Church, and at times of fast (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by commanded) hee not only observed the abstinence prescribed, but used other uninjoyned meanes of mortification, by wearing Faire shirts next his skinne, and tying himselfe to that austerity of life, and strictnesse of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, that the strictest and most religious penitentiary could doe no more.</p>
            <p>Hee was so inclinable to pittie, that when hee spied the quarter of a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour set over one of the gates of <hi>London</hi> upon a pole, hee caused the same instantly to bee taken downe and buried, saying, I will not have such cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie executed against a Christian after death for my sake, it is enough if not too much that hee received the punishment of death for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>His patience was such, that to one that strooke him when hee was taken prisoner, hee only said, forsooth you doe wrong your selfe more then mee to strike the Lords annointed.</p>
            <p>To another that (when hee was in Prison) had drawne blood of him with a weapon, when after hee was at libertie, and the partie that had given him the wound was brought before him, hee freely pardoned him, saying, Alas poore soule, hee strooke mee more to winne favour with others then any ill-will hee bare mee; of that happy memory, that hee never forgot any thing but injury. Lastly, his courage in a good cause, appeared in this, that being a little before his death in a peremptorie manner demaunded by the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> why hee had held the Crowne so long unjustly from the rightfull heire, boldly thus answered,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7754:104"/>
My father was Crowned King of <hi>England,</hi> and quietly without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction enioyed the same, as my Grandfather his Father had hald the same before him, and I but a child was Proclaimed undubitate heire thereto, and was accordingly sacred and Crowned King without interruption, first of <hi>England</hi> and afterwards of <hi>France,</hi> all men to me as to my ancestors swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and doing fealty and homage, and so I have held <hi>England</hi> wel-ny Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine yeares; And therefore I may say with the holy King and Prophet <hi>David, My lat is fallen in a faire ground, yea, I have a goodly heritage, my helpe is in the Lord, which will save the upright in heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His pious intention for provision for competent maintenance for Prophets and Prophets children, appeareth by his testamentary appointment for the building, and endowing Kings Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and <hi>Eaton</hi> Colledge by <hi>Windsor:</hi> And other like Donations appointed by his last Will.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> presently after the interment of King <hi>Henry,</hi> drawes his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces toward <hi>Sandwitch</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> where some of the followers of <hi>Faucon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> to the number of eight or nine hundred, had in the Castle thereof strongly fortified themselves; Who upon notice of the Kings approach in Person, sent Sir <hi>George Brookes</hi> unto him with this message, that if hee would vouchsafe them (which they humbly desired) his gratious Pardon, so as they might bee assured to have their lives, limmes, and liberty saved, they would surrender into his hands the Castle, with their shipping and all things therein, and submit themselves in all obedience to his command, and sweare which hitherto they never had done, from thenceforth for ever to continue his faithfull, loyall, and obedient subjects; But if this mercy were denyed them, they were resolute to fight it out to the last man, fire the shipping, and sell their lives at the deerest rate, neither were they so destitute of promised assistance, that they had any just cause to despaire of their relievement, if they should abide the hazard, (being sufficiently victualed to hold out for six moneths) of being besieged.</p>
            <p>The Councell having throughly debated of the proposition, by the Kings appointment, and by the instigation of the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> they advised the King to attonement with them, and hee accordingly granted their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, and marching to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> there sealed, and from thence sent by the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> (who now began to affect popularity, and endeere himselfe to souldiers,) their generall Pardon, who bringing it unto them, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got not to acquaint them, with what difficultie hee had obtained the same at the Kings hands.</p>
            <p>Vpon the receipt thereof, both Castle and ships to the number of thirteene, are delivered up to the Duke for the Kings use; But how this composition was observed, may bee imagined; when <hi>Fauconbridge</hi> (who was compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the same Pardon) was afterwards taken and executed at <hi>Southampton;</hi> And <hi>Spicing</hi> and <hi>Quintine</hi> the Captaines that assayled <hi>Algate</hi> and <hi>Bishops<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> and were Commanders, and in <hi>Sandwitch</hi> Castle at the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render thereof, were presently beheaded at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and their heads sent to bee placed on poles on those gates at <hi>London,</hi> they had severally as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted; And by a Commission of <hi>oyre</hi> and <hi>terminer,</hi> divers both in <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Kent,</hi> were arraigned and condemned for this rebellion, but more for that put to fine &amp; ransome then death, to the great impoverishing of the Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Kent,</hi> and undoing the Gentlemen of <hi>Essex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King upon Whitson eve returneth to <hi>London,</hi> where (advised there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by his Councell) hee sent great <hi>Warwickes</hi> Brother the Archbishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> to bee kept prisoner in the Castle of <hi>Guisnes,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>

               <hi>Hams,</hi> and layed all the Ports for the stopping of the Earle of <hi>Penbrookes</hi> going out of <hi>England,</hi> which hee neverthelesse afterwards did with the young Earle of <hi>Richmond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> much displeased, with the escape of the Earle of <hi>Penbrooke,</hi> but more of that of <hi>Richmond,</hi> (by how-much the one could but abet, the other might lay claime) sent his Letters over to the Duke of <hi>Britaine,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those two Earles had found meanes to convey themselves, and were in <hi>Britanny</hi> by him kindly entertained, intimating therein his earnest desire, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have them sent over to him, or at least watchfully kept from attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any thing (which he had iust causte to suspect they would) to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, by their being at liberty, with many promises of thankfull respect, for this courtesie if granted, and for an earnest thereof sent him a token, worthy the receiving, which so prevailed with the Duke, that the two Earles were debard each others company, and all their English attendants taken from them and <hi>Britons</hi> appointed in their places, which somewhat satisfied the King of <hi>England,</hi> but gave no content to the English Gentlemen in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Parliament is called at <hi>Westminster</hi> wherein all acts formerly made by him, are confirmed. And those that King <hi>Henry</hi> after his redemption of the <note place="margin">An. 1473.

            <p>Towards his charges: in this Parliament, a competent summe of mony is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarilie given, and in respect thereof a generall pardon is granted.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Burgoyne,</hi> not willing that his courtesies formerly done to his brother in law should be thought upon, and willing to ingulph him in the warres of <hi>France.</hi> That he in the meane time might have the better oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to worke some malicious stratagem against the French king; sends over Embassadors, with ample instructions, to solicit the King of <hi>England,</hi> to set on foot his title to the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> making great offers with protestations, to ayd and assist him therein; both with purse and person.</p>
            <p>The Embassadors have audience, and after much debating the poynt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the privy Councell, it was thus amongst them concluded.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> was not ambitiously affected. But the title thereof legally Challenged as the unquestionable right of the now King of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 That the French warres (if orderly pursued) alwayes enriched Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Souldiers.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That <hi>France</hi> being made the seat of the war it would keepe them from making invasion on <hi>England,</hi> and hinder them from supporting any against the King of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 That the French King had in an unsufferable fashion given an affront to the King of <hi>England,</hi> in ayding and abetting Queene <hi>Margaret,</hi> and her trayterous complices against him, and prohibiting any his true subiects to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side within his territories. And in continually sending combustible stuffe to feed the fire of rebellion, which had so disquieted the common-wealth of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 That the King of <hi>France,</hi> infested the Duke of <hi>Burgonies</hi> Countries with warres, who was a friend and Collegue with the King of <hi>England,</hi> and one that was in league with him both offensive and defensive.</p>
            <p>Therefore this proposition from the Duke of <hi>Burgoin</hi> to vndertake the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7754:105"/>
warres against <hi>France,</hi> was to be approved of, as being both lawfull and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofefull for the honour of the King and the good of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>But the meanes how to pursue the warre being once undertaken was an other cause considerable. For treasure (the sinewes of warre) was wanting, and to procure a supply by Parliamentary courses would take up too much time. They were therefore driven to find out and set on foote a proiect till then unheard of, which was to draw by way of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence from the subject, a seeming voluntary, (howsoever often very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly payed) contribution, Thereby to supply the want of mony for the pursuance of these warres.</p>
            <p>To this end divers Commissioners are assigned, with letters to the knights and Gentlemen, and severall instructions are sent into every County, who did therein so effectually Comply themselues to doe the King service, that by their perwasions most men of abilitie did enlarge their contributions to this so faire an enterprise, and readily departed with their mony. And a Kings kys to a sparing and therefore, a rich widdow, amongst many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers drawne in by Court holy water to make oblation, brought in twenty pounds more then was demanded, for that being but twenty she gave forty. <note place="margin">A Kings kys to a rich wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow procured 40. where but 20. was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is almost a matter of admiration in these dayes, how in those dayes, The King could out of this little Island, be furnished with able men for his warres, old men women, and children, with sufficient meate to put in their mouthes; the Cleargy, and Schollers with competent maintenance, and the markets with necessary provision, considering the infinite number of those in the late Civill broyles slaughtered, the paucitie of Ploughmen and husbandmen, the want of farmers, and the indigency of Cattell where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to stocke their farmes, infinite quantities of ground lying unmanurde or tilled, and the pastures and downes without sheepe or Cattell. The generall spoyle and wastment, which the Souldiers wheresoever they came (and that was almost every where) in this kingdome made, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ceasing and neglect of commerce or trafficke, the shipping not daring to stir abroad, the danger being so great to be robbed and spoyled either by hombred pirates or forraine foes; yet such was Gods great mercies that every one of these respectively were supplied, and did subsist without any notable defect, or extraordinary want.</p>

This letter the French king read, and withdrawing himselfe caused the Harold to be brought to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, to whom in private he gave this answer. That the Duke of <hi>Burgoyn</hi> and the Constable (by whose trayterous instigation and not of his owne inclination) he knew the King of <hi>England,</hi> intended to visite <hi>France,</hi> would but delude him, for they were dissemblers and impostors.

But the journey was to little purpose, onely it occasioned the Duke with a small Troope of horse to come unto the King of <hi>England,</hi> formally to excuse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, for beeing so backward: in that he having with his forces beene embroyled in the siege of <hi>Nants,</hi> could not depart thence without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite <note place="margin">The duke of <hi>Burgoyn</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth his breach of promise.</note> disgrace, if neither Composition or submission were enforced, which now notwithstanding, because hee would not too much tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe upon his brother in lawes patience to have longer expected hiscom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, he was by the obstinacy of the besieged enforced to do. But promised to supply all defects both with his presence and power and that speedily.</p>
            <p>The Constable likewise by letters perswades the King of <hi>England</hi> to proceed in the action, and not to doubt from the Duke and himselfe, but <note place="margin">The Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble repromi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth ayd.</note> to be sufficiently accommodated every way, and seconded.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> thus encouraged marcheth on. But in his way found no performance of promises either on the Dukes, or Constables part. For the first did not at their comming to <hi>Peroone</hi> accommodate the souldiers with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall or lodging, in that manner as was requisite and expected. And the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in steed of surrendring up of S. <hi>Quintayns</hi> according to the agreement, made a sally out upon such as were sent from the King of <hi>England</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the same, playing upon them with their great ordnance. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon King <hi>Edward</hi> comparing the last dayes words with this dayes actions, began to suspect the truth of the Kings description of the Duke &amp; Constables condition, and from thence forward stood upon his own gard, and gaveno further credence to any of their protestations, which the Duke of <hi>Burgoyne</hi>

            <p>The French King having intelligence of the Dukes departure, forcasting the worst, suspecteth that the Duke was (with an intent to returne) gone to bring on his power, well knowing that if they should unite their forces, his Crowne was in great hazard to be pluckt from him. Neverthelesse hee thought that winter being so neere they could not well keepe the field, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever being his crafts Master, and politicke enough to worke his own ends which hee seldome fayled in, he resolved with himselfe to assay what might be done to mediate a peace with the English in <hi>Burgoins</hi> absence, And yet <note place="margin">The policy of the French King.</note> so to retreate, that if it tooke not effect he might disclaime the knowledge of the overture, he therefore privately dispatcheth a messenger in show, of an Herhought indeed hee was a fellow neither of Office or estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not knowne to any of the Kings houshould, but to <hi>Villeers</hi> the Master of the horse who onely was acquainted with the plot and partie This Counterfeit pursevant at armes, with a Coate made of a Trumpets banner rowle, ad dressed himselfe to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and upon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to his presence, insinuates the French Kings desire, which was to have Commissioners on both parts consigned to conferre of the means, to reconcile the differences betwixt the two Kings: at least-wise to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the cessation from warres for some time: and so well this messenger: delivered his arrand; That it was credited and his request granted, and with a reward and a letter of safe conduct, for such as should be imployd from the French King in this businesse is returned and an Herhaught like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <note place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> sends an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald of armes to <hi>Lewis.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>After long conference the Articles of peace were concluded on to this effect.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The French King was to pay presently to the King of <hi>England</hi> three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and fifteene thousand Crownes. And from thence forth annually pay fifty thousand Crownes during the life of King <hi>Edward.</hi>

            <p>The motives that induced King <hi>Edward,</hi> the sooner to condesend to this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord were.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The vacillation and instabiltie, of the Duke of <hi>Burgoyne,</hi> and the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they never performing any the agreements really concluded on.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The extremitie of winter approching, the present want of fodder, and the not having any strong place or fort to shelter the souldier in.</p>

But he came to late too prevent what was done. King <hi>Edward</hi> perswades him to enter into the peace according to the reservation. But <hi>Charles</hi> reprocheth K. <hi>Edward</hi> for entring into such a truce, saying that K. <hi>Edwards</hi> predecessors had with their armies performed many brave &amp; notable exploites upon the French &amp; purchased thereby fame and reputation, and that he had brought his souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but to show them the Country, &amp; returne as they came, adding therwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, That to make it appeare to the world, that he was able without the helpe of the English, to subsist of himself he disclaimed any benefit by that truce, or any other reconciliation with the French: untill three months after the English had remained in their owne Country. But when King <hi>Edward</hi> not well pleased with this French bravado, retorted unto him the base and forgetfull neglect both on the Constables part, and his, of not being their words Masters. The Duke in a great snuffe returnes to <hi>Luxenburg</hi> from whence he came.</p>
            <p>For the better confirmation of what was agreed upon, and setling of amitie betwixt the two Kings an interview is desired, but before the same is effectuated, the French King sends unto the English armye, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Tun of <hi>Gasooyne</hi> wine to be drunke out, amongst the private soulders and therewith free licence at pleasure for Commanders and Gentlemen of ranke and qualitie to recreate themselues in <hi>Amiens,</hi> where they were freely and fairely entertained by the Burgers at the kings expresse comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.

themselves, K. <hi>Edward</hi> being come in sight of the place, maketh a stand as being told, the omission of any circumstance, in point of honour might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon not wisely forecasting all passages of state, and knowing to attend the first offer of the ceremony, would much take of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dignity of his state which although King <hi>Lewis</hi> perhaps did apprehend, yet hee would not stand to straining of curtesie, and fearing to loose the faire opportunity, to give two blowes with one stone (free himselfe from their presence whose breath was to hot for his company, &amp; weaken therby the arme of an overweening neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,) he gave the K. of <hi>England</hi> the advantage to come at his pleasure, whilst first to the bar appointed for conference. And there did attend King <hi>Edwards</hi> leasure, he had in his company <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> with his brother the Cardinal, and was attended with 800. men at armes. King <hi>Edward</hi> comes with his brother the Duke of <hi>Clarence, (Glocester</hi> wanting moderation with patience to admit a Court complement in the sight of an army, with a French man) excused his not comming the Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the Lords Chamberlaine and Chancellor, and at his backe his whole army in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile aray. The kings lovingly embrace each other &amp; court cringes, &amp; comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of courtesie reciprocally passe, which finished, they with their nobles then present all take their oathes upon the holy Evangelists, in all things <hi>pro posse</hi> to observe the articles of accord concluded on as afore. Then all were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to withdraw, themselves whilst the two kings fall into private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, concerning the Dukes of <hi>Burgoyne</hi> and <hi>Britany. Lewis</hi> leaves not a string untoucht that might make muficke for his profit. And having felt the K. of <hi>Englands</hi> pulse not to beate over strongly on behalfe of his brother in law, &amp; that on his part he desired but respit until he might receive answer of a message he would send, to the D. &amp; that if he refused to accept of the benefit of the accord, he would leave him to the French K. pleasure, he leaves further speech of him &amp; earnestly importnes that <hi>Britayn</hi> might be left out of their articles, which K. <hi>E.</hi> utterly denies, affirming that he had found the D. an open hearted &amp; opehanded friend to his in his extremity, &amp; therfore would not now leave him unregarded. <hi>Lewis</hi> observing <hi>Ed.</hi> countenance in delivery of those words thought it no policie to strain that string any higher but with all curtesie takes his leave, giving many kind words &amp; some tokens of favour to some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen &amp; all the officers: &amp; so departeth yet after he was gone: not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disgesting the K. of <hi>Englands</hi> defence of the D. of <hi>Britaine;</hi> he makes a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond motion unto him to the former purpose by letter: from whom he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <note place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> could not be drawne from ayding the Duke of <hi>Brittayne.</hi>
               </note> this resolute answer, that if the French K. desired the friendship of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> he should not molest the D. of <hi>Britayne,</hi> for he was resolved in person to come at any time for his defence, if the Duke of <hi>Britaine</hi> were disturbed wherupon K. <hi>Lewis</hi> rested satisfied though not contented, whilst K. <hi>Edw.</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slowed no time to acquaint the Duke of <hi>Britayne</hi> with all the passages, some think that had not the desire of compassing the E. of <hi>Richmond</hi> and <hi>Pembrook</hi> now in the D. of <hi>Britaines</hi> countries bin a better motive, then any respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the D. the French K. might have had better successe in his requests: K. <hi>E.</hi> to give K. <hi>Lewis</hi> a tast of his respect towards him (notwithstanding his deniall of the proposition, for the Duke of <hi>Brittaine)</hi> sends a messenger unto him, to acquaint him with trechery of the Constable against him, and to carry the more credit of the truth of what was intimated, hee sent two letters written with the Constables owne hand, which were sufficient testimonies to accuse and convince the Constable of those crymes wherewith afterwards King <hi>Edward</hi> charged him.</p>
            <p>The mony to be payd by the Articles, is borowed of the <hi>Parisians,</hi> (so

            <p>Some forbeare not to say that K. <hi>E.</hi> lost more honour in this voyage then hee had purchased in nine victories before gotten: but they were such as measure kings actions by the crooked level of their own erroneous fancies. But those of better understanding affirme, that it had bin a great error in judgement for the K. to be longer absent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his so late conquered kingdom, but great wisdome &amp; policie in him to take hold upon such an occasion to come off so fairely with a match for his daughter which had it taken effect, had sufficiently recompenced his charge &amp; trouble. But private men must not dispute the actions of Princes. And further to examine the reason of what in this kind at this time was done, might give occasion of discourse but not instruction King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> being returned into <hi>England</hi> not unmindful that a great storme might follow, though but a smal cloud as yet appeared, dispatched Embassador to the <note place="margin">A. 1475.

               <hi>Cecily</hi> his younger daughter, this faire overture of marriage, or rather the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mediation of Angels (wherof some store were sent but more promised) so prevailed with the D. That upon the receipt of the sum sent, the E. of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> is delivered to the Embassadors, who thence conducted him to S. <hi>Malos</hi> where whilst they staied for a wind, by the cunning advise and plotting of the D. treasurer, (who as it may be by the sequel gathered, not wel pleased not to have bin treated withal, according to that court custome with a feeling respect a more then ordinary proportion, or common gratuity being inseparably inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his treasurers place, more scorne to be so neglected, then love to <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond)</hi> The young L. escapes into <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> From whence nor promises nor prayers could procure him. Neverthelesse upon <hi>Peter Londoys</hi> his promise he should be safely kept there. The Embassadors without their marchandize or <note place="margin">Escapeth into Sanctuary.</note> mony departed to the no little discontent of the K. who greived much that the lambe had escaped his woolvish intention; But being taught the rule what he could not avoyd, he made shew to receive willingly, he for that time said little. </p>
            <p>At Christmas following he created his eldest son <hi>Ed.</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> D. of <hi>Cornwale,</hi> and E. of <hi>Chester;</hi> his second son Duke of <hi>York,</hi> giving the order of knighthood, to the son &amp; heire of the E. of <hi>Lincolne</hi> &amp; many others.

Thus whilst K. <hi>Edw.</hi> in <hi>England</hi> lived in peace &amp; quiet the turbulent D. of <hi>Burgoyne</hi> never constant, but alwayes in contention, reaped the triple fruit therof, this yeare at three several times. The first at <hi>Ganson,</hi> where, he lost some honour but more wealth. The second at <hi>Morat</hi> where he lost more honour and many men. The last at <hi>Nancy,</hi> where he not only lost, men, mony, &amp; reputation but life also by the <hi>Switzers</hi> whom he had driven to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparate resolution &amp; then not in hope to escape, but to sell their lives, (when submissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would not be accepted at the deerest rate) they fought &amp; prevailed.

            <p>This <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> was Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> and <hi>Salisbury,</hi> Lord of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and great Chamberlaine of <hi>England,</hi> he married <hi>Isabell</hi> daughter and coheire of <hi>Richard Nevill</hi> the great Earle of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> by whom hee had issue <hi>Edward</hi> afterwards Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> who dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out issue, and <hi>Margaret</hi> married to Sir <hi>Richard Pole</hi> knight who had issue, <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Mountayne</hi> and <hi>Reginald Pole</hi> Cardinall. The Pestilence about this time raged with that fury in most parts of this kingdome, that the sword in fifteene yeeres before devoured not so many as that did in foure moneths.</p>
            <p>The King upon some present occasion sent to the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> a privie seale for the loane of five thousand markes for a yeere which were <note place="margin">An. 1480.

The <hi>Scots</hi> make an inrod into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> against whom the Duke of <hi>Gloce.</hi> was sent with some power but they were retreated before his comming.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iames</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> shortly afterward sent Embassadors to treat of a marriage between his eldest son <hi>Iames</hi> Duke of <hi>Rothsay,</hi> &amp; <hi>Cecily</hi> the kings second daughter.

This <hi>Iames</hi> K. of <hi>Scotland</hi> was too much wedded to his own opinion, &amp; couldnot endure any mans advise, (how good soever it were,) that he fancied not, he would seldom aske counsel, but never follow any by reason wherof, such of his counsell, as more respected the honour of the kingdom, &amp; the publike good, then what should be pleasing to his private conceits or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar fancy, did divers times reape exilement, and ill will, for truth speaking and well meaning, so that the way to win his favour could not be found out or followed but by flattery, whereby few or none but thrasonicall parasites, and camelion timepleasers would follow the court, or continue their places ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: hence came it that many ignoble affronts were offred to the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp; more disrespects done to his own nobility.

            <p>The nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> observing the miserable spoyle that the English ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my did; &amp; the impossibility to prevent it by opposition, endevored by humble submission, to procure a peace, at least a cessation from wars, which with much importunitie they obtained, at the hands of the general under these conditions.</p>

Al which except the first article were accordingly performed. A Generall pardon and loving letters from the king are sent unto the Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> with an authentick instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the common seale of the Provost and Citizens of <hi>Edenborough</hi> for the performance of that part that belonged to them, to the D. of <hi>Gloc.</hi> who upon the receipt therof, &amp; the surrender of the Castle of <hi>Barwick</hi> with all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dnance and amunition therin, (of which and of the towne, the Lord <hi>Stanley</hi> with a competent number of Souldiers to gard the same, being made Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.)

And did make proffer both of purse and person, to give him assistance therin to the uttermost: preparation for the invasion of <hi>France,</hi> is making in every place, to which the King is very proclive.

            <p>The King the night before his death, having before observed some discourte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous passages to have gone betwixt the kindred of his Queene and some of the nobles, but principally between the Queene and the Lord Chamberlaine, (for women that have beene widdowes Commonly maligne them most whom their husbands esteeme much of) not out of malice but nature) caused them all to come to his bed side, to whom he sayd holding the Queene by the hand.</p>
            <p>My Lords deere kinsmen and allies, in what plight I lye, you may discerne but I feele, wherfore the lesse while I looke to live with you, the more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I am moved, to be carefull in what case I shall leave you. For I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent such as I leave you, my children shall find you. And if as (God forbid) they should find you at variance, They may unhappely fall at jar themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have capability of discreation to set attonement betweene you.</p>
            <p>You see the tendernesse of their yeares, The onely securitie therefore of their well being must consist in your concord. For it sufficeth not, if all of you respectively affect them, if any of you stomacke the other, if they were men your integritie happily might be sufficient. But childhood must be refulcitated by wise mens authoritie, And slippery youth underpropped with elder Counsel, neither of which they can have except you give it, neither can you give it unlesse you accord together.</p>
            <p>For when each laboureth to pluck downe what another setteth up, and for hatred to each others person, impugneth each others Counsel, it must be long before any good conclusion goe forward; And whilst each laboureth for superioritie Flattery shall have more place, then plaine and faithfull advice, from whence of necessitie must ensew the untoward education of the young Prince, whose mind in tender youth, infected with loosenesse of dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, will (naturally thereto enclined) slip into ryot and mischiefe, and so be the meanes of his owne and this Kingdomes ruine, except God send the greater blessing, and through his grace make him apply his heart to wisdome, which if (as God grant he may) he shall attaine unto, then they that by sinister perswasion, and evill advice flattered him at first most, and pleased him best, shall afterward fall furthest out of his fauor, for politicke plots and vitious courses ever at length shall reape the sowre, when good and wholsome Counsell though at first not embraced, shall prove sweete and wholesome.</p>
            <p>I remember it to my griefe, that there hath beene discord among you, a great time, not alwayes for great causes, but poore mistakings, sometimes a thing right well intended towards us, our misinterpretation turneth to ill; or a small displeasure done us, is either by our own ill affection or evill tongue exasperated; Yet this I wot well, you never had so good occasion of emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as you have of unfayned affection.</p>
            <p>That wee be all men, all natives of one nation, nay, all Christians, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7754:110"/>
adopted brethren in Christ, I leave for Preachers to tell you; And yet I am uncertaine, whether any Preachers words, ought to have more power to move you than his; That is your Soveraigne Lord, and is by and by togoe to that place, that they all preach of.</p>
            <p>But this I shall instantly desire you to print in your memory, that the one part of you are my owne flesh and blood, the other of my Allyance, and each of you with other, of consanguinity or affinitie; And this spirituall conjunction by affinitie (if the Sacraments of Christs Church, hold that esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation with us, which they ought, and I wish with all my soule they did, should no lesse move to mutuall charitie, then the bare respect of fleshly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinity. <hi>Jesus</hi> forbid that you should live and love together the worse, for the selfe-same cause for which you ought to love the better, and yet that of late (the more the pitie) hath too often falne out amongst us; And sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is there found more deadly fewd, then amongst them, which by right and reason ought most affectionately to live together; But such a bewitching serpent is Ambition, and appetite of vaine-glory and Soveraigntie, that amongst states where shee once entereth, shee slideth onward so swiftly, and maketh forward so fast and so farre, that shee seldome stops, nor leaves wrig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and wrangling, untill by dissention and division, shee have infected all that are neere her. And first those that bee poysoned by her, are carried away with a vehement desire to bee next the best, then to walke hand in hand with the best, and lastly to transcend the best, not brooking any equall, or allowing any superiour.</p>
            <p>Through this immoderate affecting of titular worship, and borrowed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of popularitie, and thereby of debate and separation, what detriment, what trouble, what sorrow within these few yeares, hath growne in this Realme? I pray God aswell forget, as wee have too much cause to our griefe to remember: which events if I could then aswell have foreseene, as I have with my more paine then pleasure now proved; By Gods blest Lady, I would never have wonne the courtesies of mens knees, with the losse of so many their friends heads, but since what is past cannot bee recalled, we ought to bee the more circumspect, that by that occasion wee have suffered such infinite mischiefes before, that wee eftsoones fall not into the like againe.</p>
            <p>Intestine broyles are now passed, and the Lord bee praised the republike is at quiet; And this kingdome in outward appearance in a faire likelyhood to prosper in wealth and peace, under my children your Cousins, if God send them life, and you reciprocall love, of which two things, the lesse losse would be they, by whom though God did his pleasure, yet should the kingdome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes find Kings, and peradventure as good Kings.</p>
            <p>But if you amongst your selves, in an Infants raigne fall at variance: many a good Christian shall perish, and happily hee and you too before this land shall againe find the sweetnesse of peace. Therefore in these last words that your dying King shall ever deliver unto you, I earnestly exhort you, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly adjure you, and every one of you, for the love that I have ever borne you, for the love of your owne soules, and for the love that our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour beares unto us all: That from this time forward (all discontents drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, unkindnesses buried, and grudges forgotten,) each of you embrace one anothers friendship, and unfeignedly love each the other, which I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently perswaded you will, if you regard any earthly thing that is good, if you respect God, your King, your Native countrey, the quiet of the Kingdome, kindred or affinitie, nay, your owne safetie and soules health.</p>
            <p>And so unable to use any longer speech, hee sunke downe into his bed,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7754:111"/>
turning his eyes towards them, and by his countenance exprest, how desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous hee was, to have that which hee had imparted unto them imprinted in their memory; and that hee would have added more, if able, to perswade their mutuall atonement, and reciprocabilitie of reall abolition of all former disagreement, and unfeyned entertainment of future loving affection.</p>
            <p>The hearers (as the sequell proved) more at that time to give him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, then performe what hee with so great and good affection, had so Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianly requested) embrace each other, and who so forward to make faire expression of his good intention as the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and to that end hee with low obeysance first importunes the Queene to blot out of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, any discurtesie or neglect hee had offered unto her, protesting upon his faith to God, and honour to his house, to bee for ever her observant, and affectionate servant: and then turning about to those that were present, hee said, My Lords, I desire to be entertained in your good affections, and I here freely forgive whatsoever unkindnesse, discourtesie, or abuse I have received from any of you, and desire the like from you to mee; and so courteously shaking them all by the hands, made show of reconcilement, when all was counterfeit.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE young Prince was at <hi>Ludlowe</hi> when his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">An. 1483.</note> died, being not long before sent thither, with his Presence, to curbe the exorbitant licentiousnesse of some of the unruly <hi>Welch,</hi> who taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the great distance, that was betwixt their Countrey and the Courts of Iustice, which were then settled at <hi>Westminster,</hi> would divers times in assurance of impunitie attempt many disorderly pranckes.</p>
            <p>For his better proceeding in mannaging of his place, the King had appointed <hi>Anthony</hi> Earle <hi>Rivers</hi> the Queenes Brother, and so by the Mothers side Vncle to the Prince, to bee his Director and chiefe Councellor, with whom likewise were many of the Queenes Kinred and Allies, in chiefe esteeme and office, whereat the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> tooke exception; And well knowing, that if these were not by some meanes or other removed, and their present power abated, it was in vaine for him to set on foot, his new hatched stratagemicall project, to disinherit the new King, and to take hold of the Crowne in his owne right, hee did therefore cast about, to procure their amotion, the one from his place, the other from their Offices and attendance. And to that purpose (presuming on their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination that way,) hee consulted first with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham;</hi> and afterwards with the Lord <hi>Hastings,</hi> making use of their distaste, against the power of the Queenes Brother, the Kings halfe Brother, and his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate malice against them all. To these in private conference hee first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuates the Queenes lowe descent, and her kinreds unworthy promotions, and afterwards openly assures them, that if these Vpstarts and mushrump nobles, were but permitted to bee about the Kings Person in his youth, they would afterwards by that meanes so purchase his favour, that they would become so powerfull, when hee should attaine to maturitie of yeares, that all the Honours, Possessions, and lines of the ancient Nobilitie of this Realme would bee in danger, to bee subject to their wills; And for prevention
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7754:112"/>
thereof, hee did perswade them to joyne with him for their amotion, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, that that effected, they might ratably proportion to themselves, and share all the dignities and places, and what benefit there might accrew thereby, amongst themselves and their friends.</p>
            <p>These insinuations of <hi>Glocester,</hi> joyned to their owne ambitious and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent dispositions, so powerfully wrought upon their yeelding natures, that they not only condescended to this proposition, for the amovall of the Queenes kinred, but to whatsoever the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> should afterwards promove unto them.</p>
            <p>But it is to bee observed, that over and above the great wheele, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in their fancies, of envy to the eminencie of the Queenes kinred; there were two other lesser rounds, which not a little furthered this rotunditie for association. The one <hi>Buckinghams</hi> covetous desire to encrease his reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, by the addition of the Earledome of <hi>Hertford</hi> for his part, the other in the late Chamberlaine, to have so good meanes, whereby to stave off such whom in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes hee had justly offended, in transcending his authoritie in doing many actions, whereof hee was reous of too too many, presuming now by this way to bee supported, and though to the offence of many hee had made his office the stauking-horse of his will, yet none should dare say blacke to his eye.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things are projecting, the Queene appointeth Earle <hi>Rivers</hi> her Brother, and her Sonne <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and the rest of her Allyes and friends, to provide with a strong power of able souldiers, to guard the young King from <hi>Ludlowe</hi> to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> being herewith acquainted, might well thinke, that if this plot were not effected before that time, his pollicie hardly after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards would in that point prevaile; Hee therefore cunningly writes to the Queene, whom ever since her husbands death, hee had with a great show of respect, by visitation and intercourse of message brought to a fooles beliefe, to take seeming for being, and shadowes for realityes; And by his Letters intimates to her, that it was rumored abroad, that her Brother and Sonne, against her will, and without the knowledge of the late Kings kinred, was providing with a mighty power of armed souldiers, to conduct his Majestie in hostile manner from <hi>Wales</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> which if it should bee so done, would breed a great jelousie in the mindes of the common people, who are apt enough to make an ill construction of the best action whereof they are ignorant; That there were ill members whom the King had cause to suspect, and therefore enforcedly came thus armed.</p>
            <p>And where as now there was no appearance or likelihood, but of true love and affection, betwixt his kinred and her Allyes, if any armed troopes should bee now raised, and no cause knowne to what end, the so late unfeyned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement, so happily by his late Brother procured, would bee in question to bee dissolved, yea any the least mistake, mislike, or distaste, that might bee taken, arise, or given, amongst the meanest of the common souldiers, might minister occasion to disquiet the peace of the kingdome, and set him and her Brother, and partakers on both sides together by the eares, and the mischiefe that thereby should ensue, (as it is to be feared a great deale would) was like enough to fall on that part, to which shee wisht least hurt, and all the blame would redound to her and her kinred, which now shee might easily, so please her, prevent, if shee would but addresse her Letters to her Brother and Son, to assure them from his mouth, and upon his honour, that himselfe and all the late Kings kinred, were constantly resolved, inviolably to observe the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7754:112"/>
attonement, made by his Soveraigne and her Husband upon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, betweene her Allyes and friends, and the Kings kinred.</p>
            <p>The too credulous Lady, gave plenary consent to what the Duke of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> requested, and to that end dispatched messengers to her Brother and Sonne, who somewhat unwillingly, but upon her request, were perswaded to forbeare levying any more men, and cashired those they had provided, and attended only with their owne meniall servants, they set forwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Queene; with the young King. And with more hast then good speed, came to <hi>North-Hampton,</hi> and from thence the King went to <hi>Stony-Stratford,</hi> where the two Dukes with a great traine well provided, and mounted, arrived; And pretending the Towne to bee too little for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of their Companies, they went to <hi>Northampton,</hi> and alighted at the same Inne, where the Earle <hi>Rivers</hi> had taken up his lodging that night, resolving to overtake the King the next morning.</p>
            <p>Vpon this their accidental meeting, much Court complement, &amp; enterchange of faire language, &amp; show of courtesie passed, and not the least colour for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staste or dislike, taken or given on either side, neither by themselves or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers: But no sooner was supper ended, but the Dukes pretending weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse through hard riding, retire to their lodgings, and the Earle goeth to his.</p>
            <p>But the Dukes with their private friends, when the Earle went to bed, went to Councell what course to take, with the least suspition and the most safetie, to make away the Earle and his kinred.</p>
            <p>In this consultation they continue the most part of the night; And to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards morning, they tooke the keyes of the Inne gates, and disperst their followers to keepe the passages, with instruction not to permit horse-man or foot-man to passe the way towards <hi>Stony-Stratford,</hi> pretending that none should goe before, because the two Dukes might expresse their dutifull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the King the better, by being first ready to give their attendance at his going to horse.</p>
            <p>The Earle having notice by the Host of these proceedings, imagining his destruction was plotted, yet being debard of any meanes, either to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, or escape, hee set a good countenance upon the matter, and came boldly to the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> his Chamber, where hee found <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and the rest, with whom hee expostulates the reason of this course ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to imprison him and his in their Inne against their wills; But they in stead of shaping him an answer, made their will the law, and without more speaking, commanded the Earle to bee layd hands on, objecting those crimes to him whereof themselves only were faulty; And having taken order for his safe imprisonment, they speedily tooke horse and came to <hi>Stony-Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> at such time as the King was taking horse, whom in all faire and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner they saluted; But a staffe was quickly found that a dogge may be smitten, &amp; an offence is taken before given, a quarrell is pickt against the Lord <hi>Richard Gray</hi> the Kings halfe brother in his own presence; The Duke of <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham</hi> making relation to the King, That he and the Marquesse his Brother, with Earle <hi>Rivers</hi> the Queens Brother, had endevoured, and almost effected, to drawe unto themselves, the sole managing of the affaires of the kingdome, and to sowe dissension betwixt the Blood-royall of your Fathers side, and those scarce loyall on the Queenesside, who greedily seeke after the others ruine, and the better to effect it; The Lord Marquesse without any warrant, but of his owne head, out of the Tower of <hi>London</hi> (your principall Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine) hath taken, both the Treasure and Armour to a great quantitie; But what his purpose was to doe therewith, though they were ignorant, yet there
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:7754:113"/>
was just cause to suspect it was to no good end; And therefore it was thought expedient by the advise of the Nobilitie, to attach him at <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> to have him forth-comming, to make answer for these, and other his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold actions done against common honesty.</p>
            <p>The King for want of experience, unable to sound the depth of these plots, mildly said to him, What my Brother Marquesse hath done I cannot say, but for my Vncle and Brother here I dare answer, they are innocent of any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull practises, either against mee or you.</p>
            <p>Oh, quoth the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> that hath beene their cunning to abuse your Majesties gentlenesse, with keeping their trechery from your knowledge: And thereupon instantly in the Kings presence, they arrested the Lord <hi>Richard,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Vaughan,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Hall,</hi> and coveyed them to <hi>Northampton,</hi> and from the Kings Person, to his no little amazement and disquiet, they removed all or the most part of his ancient officers and servants, placing in their roomes, their owne creatures, whom they had power to command.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> taking upon him the custody of the King, tooke order for the conveying of the Prisoners to severall Prisons in the North parts, and then set forwards with the King towards <hi>London,</hi> giving out by the way, that the Marquesse and the Queenes kinred, had plotted the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the King, and all the blood-royall, and all the ancient Nobilitie of the Realme, and to alter the government of the Common-wealth; And that they were only imprisoned to be brought to their triall according to the Law.</p>
            <p>And the better to settle these suggestions in the apprehension of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; They brought along with them divers Carts laden with Armour (of their owne providing) with driefats and great Chests, wherein they repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bee treasure for the payment of souldiers, with which they so possest the common people, that all was believed for Gospell that was thus rumou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; But of all other the neatest devise, was to have five of the Duke of <hi>Glocesters</hi> instruments which were manacled and pinioned like Traitours, and these in every place where the King lodged by the way were dispersed, with some keepers to bee lodged in the chiefe Officers houses, and to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as men of great birth, howsoever they were now prisoners, and they must seeme to bee penitent for their offences, and confesse their owne guilt, but laying the blame on the Queenes Brother, who had drawne them into this vile plot of Treason, but these did so artificially expresse themselves, that they could at their pleasures invite their hosts to call them Traitours, and cry out, that the earth was not fit to beare such trecherous rebells: and that the Dukes were to blame, not to stay the King in that place, untill execution were done against such horrible malefactours, and their trayterous companions. This plot continued acting till the King came to <hi>London,</hi> and the disguise was taken from these impostors, and they were put to act another part.</p>
            <p>The Queene with her second Sonne, and five Daughters being at <hi>London,</hi> receiving by Post intelligence of these dolefull accidents, and fearing there were worse to follow, presently taketh Sanctuary at <hi>Westminster,</hi> with which place good Lady, shee had formerly beene acquainted.</p>
            <p>The young King much grieved at the newes, and more at the occasion, with teares and sighes expressed his discontent; But the Dukes as seeming ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of any of these things, comply themselves unto his service, and with all externall show of reverence and respect, and with many glozing prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations of their fidelitie, and care of his safetie and content, sought to comfort him, but it would not be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:7754:113"/>
The Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> by the contrivement, and procurement of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> by the Decree of the Councell table is appointed; and established Protector of the King and kingdome, which place added such fuell to the ambitious fire of his heart, that it burnt all love, naturall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect or duty, either to Countrey, kinred, or King; And now nothing sets his imagination on worke, but to compasse the meanes how to bring his trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous designes to effect; which was to make away the King and his Brother, which hee is resolved wickedly yet wittily to attempt.</p>
            <p>To contrive the getting into his custody the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> is the next Scene to bee acted, for the more easie accomplishment whereof, hee takes advantage of the Kings melancholy, and acquainteth both him and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; That the company of his Brother would much conduce to his being thereby made merry, saying withall, that the Queene Mother was more wedded to her peevish will then was convenient, either for the Honour of the kingdome, or the Kings content; And therefore wishtsome course might bee taken, either by perswasion, or otherwise to procure her, to send the Duke of <hi>Yorke;</hi> to beare the King his brother company.</p>
            <p>The counsell to whom <hi>Glocester</hi> seemed to speake nothing but <hi>Oracles,</hi> (so well had hee moulded them) presently apprehend a necessity of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to bee found for the King, and none so fit as his owne Brother; And to that end the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> (one upon whose advise the Queene-Mother did much rely) is imployed with instructions, to procure her to consent to part with her younger Sonne, to accompany the elder, which hee accordingly did, yeelding these reasons, the sooner to drawe her to yeeld, (as hee said) to reason.</p>
            <p>First, for that it was scandalous to the whole Realme, that a Child of so noble Parentage by birth, so tender of yeares, so neere the King, and so inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, should bee enforced to be a Prisoner.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That none could be permitted to enjoy the benefit of Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry priviledge, but such whose consciences did accuse them of some offence, for which they feared to bee punished by the law; But the Dukes infancy, and innocency was such, that he needed no such protection.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that none ought to bee priviledged as a Sanctuary person, but whom discretion had enabled to require it; and for that reason hee was not capable of it.</p>
            <p>And lastly, any person might bee taken out of that place, if so it bee for his owne preferment and benefit, and not to his punishment or prejudice, and therefore if the Queene should refuse to deliver him, hee must bee taken from her <hi>Volens nolens,</hi> and the rather, lest that through a froward jelousie, shee should convey him beyond the Seas, as pretending hee should be more safe in any place, then in the King his Brothers company.</p>
            <p>To these the Queene makes answer, that none was more fit to have the tutelage of the child then the Mother, and the rather, in respect of his weake and tender disposition.</p>
            <p>That each of those Brothers was the others safety, so long as they are kept asunder, that the life of the one was maintained in the body of the other; and if that one of them did well, the other was in no perill; And that it was dangerous to keepe them both in one place. And as shee was proceeding further, the Archbishop said hee was loth to put the power of his primacy in execution, but her obstinacy would to his griefe enforce him thereto; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Queene perceiving that it was concluded, that reason must not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute against the Councells resoltrion, shee with such expression of passion,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7754:114"/>
as tender-hearted Mothers use to part with a beloved child, when their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticke thoughts suggest unto them, they take their last leave of the Babe, shee taketh the Duke by the hand, and delivereth him unto the Archbishop, saying, at his hands shee would require that sweet boy, and unable to speake more, shee opened the sludgates of her eyes, and bedewing her cheekes with teares turned her backe.</p>
            <p>The Archbishop having effected his arrand, hasteth to the Lords, who in the Starre-chamber with the Protector stay expecting their comming; to whom making relation with what unwillingnesse the Mother was perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to yeeld consent to part with her child, hee presented the innocent Babe unto them, of whom the Protector had no sooner taken a glimpse, when with all ceremonious reverence hee ariseth, and embraceth him in this armes, vowing with affectionate protestations, that nothing (next the welfare of his Soveraigne, which hee esteemed above all earthly things) brought him more content then his Nephew of <hi>Yorke</hi> wisht for Presence: and then <hi>Judas-</hi>like kissing his cheeke, hee takes leave of the borde, and presently conducteth him to the King his Brother, who with joyfull heart and great affection en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him, which was by so much the more to be esteemed, by how much it was unfayned.</p>
            <p>The Protector now having the game hee hunted in his owne toyles, under pretext of provident care that they might securely repose themselves untill the distempers of the Common-wealth, (wherof himselfe only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>The Protectors machinations could not well worke by themselves, they must have assistance, hee wanted <hi>Achitophel;</hi> The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> whose authoritie and power did beare a great sway amongst the Courtiers, must cunningly be drawne to his bent; To which purpose hee proposed to him, that whereas he had beene formerly an earnest Petitioner to King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the fourth his brother-in-law, for the Earldome of <hi>Hertford,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it did appeare the Duke to have a good Title, yet hee could never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, yet now if hee would bee constant, and joyne hand in hand with him, hee would put him in a way, whereby to bee assured to obtaine it; And so upon faithfull promise, to procure <hi>Buckingham</hi> to bee estated in that Earledome, and of a match to bee concluded betwixt their issue, and an equall partition of the treasure of the Crowne betwixt them two (for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance whereof the Protectors oathes are not wanting) <hi>Buckingham</hi> is not only drawne to condescend; but is most forward to contrive, and plot stratagems, and the best courses to compasse the worst of ill effects, which was by depriving their innocent Nephews (for <hi>Glocester</hi> was Vncle by the Fathers side, and <hi>Buckingham</hi> by the marriage of their Fathers Sister) of their right and livelyhood, and some others of their lives, to make the Protector a more facile passage to lay hold on the Crowne.</p>
            <p>The Protector having purchased so true a partner of his ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, well knowing it was no good pollicy to play the villaine by halfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deale, is resolved to suffer never a rubbe to lye in the way, that might hinder the true running of his bowle; And having a farre off sounded the Lord <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings,</hi> and finding him so constant to the King his old Masters Sonnes, that nothing could withdraw him from doing them true service, hee himselfe must bee removed out of the way, the effecting whereof was none of the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:7754:114"/>
least straines of pollicie, for hee must not yet bee meddled with, untill by his nayle, the nayles of his Antagonists the Queenes Brother, and Sonnes by Sir <hi>John Gray,</hi> her former husband bee driven out: the compassing whereof was meerely <hi>Hastings</hi> his share. But no sooner was the engine up by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that should make them headlesse, but by <hi>Buckinghams</hi> device, <hi>Hastings</hi> himselfe is brought to his blocke.</p>
            <p>All the Lords of the Privie Councell are in the Protectors name generally convoked to the Tower, where at the Councell table, fitting preparations for the speedy Coronation of the young King are proposed, and other like bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse wherewith to amuse the Lords, and entertaine time, untill the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor came in, who excusing himselfe for having overslept himselfe that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, taking his Chaire, very affably saluted them, merrily jesting with some, and more then ordinarily pleasant with them all; But on a sudden he framed an excuse for his present absence, leaving them in the meane-time somewhat to conferre upon untill his returne, which hee promised should be very spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, hee so went out of the Chamber.</p>
            <p>Within the space of an houre hee returned, but the wind was turned, his affable countenance and familiar language, are changed into distracted lookes, and much show of inward perturbation, which with sighing and other passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate gestures hee expressed to the uttermost.</p>
            <p>After long silence (the better to prepare them to the more attention,) hee confusedly interrogates: what they deserved, that had nefariously practised his destruction, being of the blood royall, Vncle to the King, and Protector of his person?</p>
            <p>This unexpected interrogation in that strange manner urged, strooke such an amazement amongst the Lords, that they all stood gazing one on another, as if the Protectors speeches had had the vertue of <hi>Medusaes</hi> head. At length the Lord <hi>Hastings,</hi> by <hi>Buckinghams</hi> instigation, and presuming of his (as he thought) more then ordinary intimacie with the Protector, and the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie of his owne conscience, boldly answered, That they deserved to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the punishment of Traitours, whatsoever they were, which the rest by their silence approved: with that the Protector riseth up from his seate, with a sterne looke upon <hi>Hastings,</hi> replied; why, it is the old sorceresse my brothers Widow, and her partner that common strumpet <hi>Jane Shore,</hi> that have by incantation conspired to bereave mee of my life; And had I not by Gods great mercy happily come to the discovery of their practises, and found out the plot, they had effected their villanie before suspected: Yet have I not altogether escaped free from their malice, for behold (and then hee bared his left arme to the elbow and showed it) how mischievously they have caused this deere lim of mine to wither &amp; grow uslesse, and thus should all my body have bin served, if they might have had their will, and a little longer space.</p>
            <p>Those to whom the Queenes religious courses, and Christian condition were not unknowne, and were not altogether ignorant, to what hard shifts the Protector was driven, that could provide no other colour for his accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the showing of his late discoloured arme, the defect whereof all knew that knew him, had bin as it was ever since his birth, and the coupling of his Queene sister, and his Brothers Concubine, in one and the same plot of conspiracie against him, betweene whom there was such an antipathy of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, was the occasion that the Lords at his first speech, so now sate gazing one upon the other, untill the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> (though not well pleased, that he was not aswell made privie to this intended stratagem, as with that day es conclusion, to have the Queenes Brother, Sonne and Allyes to bee executed
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:7754:115"/>
at <hi>Pomfret,)</hi> willing, out of malignitie to her to helpe forward the accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against the Queene, but with some pretext to extenuate the aspersion cast upon his Paramore Mistris <hi>Shoare</hi> (whom ever since the death of the King, he had entertained for his bedfellow, and had but that morning parted from her) with a sober looke submisly said, If the Queene have conspired, (which word was no sooner out of the Chamberlaines mouth, when the Protector in great show of choler, clapping his fist upon the borde frowning, looking upon him said, tellest thou mee of if and and? I tell thee they, and none but they have done it, and thou thy selfe art not only acquainted with, but parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the villany, and that I will make good upon thy body.</p>
            <p>And there with upon a watch-word given, those prepared before for that purpose, in the outer chamber cryed, Treason, treason, wherewith a great number of men in arms came rushing in, as it were the guard to the Protector, one of which with a Pollax strooke a maine blow at the Lord <hi>Strange,</hi> and wounded him on the head, and had slaine him outright, had bee not to avoid the stroke slipt backward, and falne downe upon the ground; Forthwith the Protector arrested the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> of high Treason, and wisht him to make hast to bee Confessed, for hee sware by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (his usuall oath,) That hee would not touch bread or drinke, untill hee had his head from his shoulders. <hi>Hastings</hi> calling to mind his last nights dreames, his solicitations that morning by his sweet Mistris, from either trusting the Bore, or that day to bee at the Councell borde, the speeches that had past betwixt the Lord <hi>Stanley</hi> and him in riding together, and the ominous predictions of ill speed, by the often stumbling of his horse, and such old peoples observations, hee was easily perswaded to give credit to what the Protector had sworne, yet being about to say somewhat, hee was presently hurried away, and lest hee should have beene too long at shrift, or therein might discover what hee knew, which though it were not much, yet it was more then the Protector would have willingly knowne, lest the world might bee acquainted with his villany, he was upon the next Timber-log they were at, (though layd there for a better use) beheaded on the greene neere the Chappell of the Tower; So absolute was the Protectors progresse in policy, that incited <hi>Hastings</hi> on to plot the death of Earle <hi>Rivers,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and the rest of the Queenes kinred at <hi>Pomfret</hi> on the same day, whereon <hi>Buckingham</hi> by the like traine, had plotted to make him headlesse; And that there might seeme some ground for what was done, The Lords grace of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> the Lord <hi>Stanley,</hi> and divers others were presently clapt Prisoners, in sundry holds of the Tower; And for a further colourable glosse of this so plaine a text.

And without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Triall, which as now was needlesse, in regard hee was taken in the manner, and presumed to have beene reskued if execution had beene defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, instantly to have him beheaded. Then the Protector heartily thanked the Londoners great love and paines, whereby they did expresse their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse, to bring him succour so opportunely, desiring them to acquaint their neighbours with what had passed, and so dismissed them, but with them sent an Harrold at armes with a Proclamation, which for the length, and faire writing in a set hand in Parchment, to all of judgement did appeare, to bee prepared long before the intimated offences against the Lord <hi>Hastings,</hi> therein so fully expressed, were either knowne or suspected. This Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the Kings name was publikely made, the Maior and the Sheriffs present in all places usuall, wherewith howsoever the vulgar seemed satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, which seldome understand the truth of State matters, and are carried away more with opinion then judgement, yet those of more understanding did not forbeare publikely to say, that the Proclamation was dictated by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination, and ingrossed by sorcery.</p>

by argument and example, the truth of his doctrine. And with as much illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Arts could use or nature helpe forward; extold the many heroicke vertues of <hi>Richard</hi> late Duke of <hi>Yorke:</hi> the sole legitimat sonne of whom and lively patterne of whose disposition he pronounced the Duke of <hi>Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> now protector to be the true &amp; lively Image, yet though the protector ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and an extraordinary traine, came to the Sermon place, whilst his Commendations were by the preacher set out beyond the allowance oftruth, whereof hee had made ample declaration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and now againe after the two Dukes were seated did inculcate the same passage of the protectors praysworthy graces, and many merits, yet neither the declaration or repetition could prevaile so far as to win beliefe in the auditory, of what was urged, or delivered: which though it no way dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the protector, yet it so dejected the doctor, that the Sermon ended he as ashamed of his lesson disconsolately departed, and never after that, was publickly seene. But left the second part to be acted, by Fryer <hi>Pincket</hi> upon <hi>Easter</hi> monday following: and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> in the meane time to take their cures and to proceed in the pageant. And accordingly with in two dayes after, <hi>Buckingham</hi> having procured the Maior Sir <hi>Edmond Shaw</hi> to assemble the Record, er Aldermen, Shriffes and many of the substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialest Citizens in every ward at the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> as it were to giue approbation of what the Doctor at <hi>Paules</hi> Crosse had the Sunday before (so unlike himselfe forgetfully suggested) to the same purpose, and upon the said theame, made a rethoricall (though not religious) exhortation, concluding with this portion of Scripture, <hi>Woe to that Realme that hath a child to their King.</hi> But the people, contrarie to his expectation, and the Maior prepared (as was promised) voyces, all were silent, whereupon the Duke, enquired in private of the Maire the reason of this their dull silence. And was answered, that the assembly, did not well heare nor understand what he had sayd wherupon the Duke strayning his voyce began againe, and both with gesture of body, &amp; formally composed countenance, repeated to the same purpose other words whereby he gained the Commendations, That no man could deliver so much bad matter, in so good words and quaint phrases.</p>
            <p>But whether out of tendernesse of Conscience, or straining courtesie who should first begin, or which is likely the heavenly providence had so decreed it, not the least show amongst the assemblie of giving allowance of what was spoken, by word of mouth or other gesture was discovered; wherupon the Maior sayd to <hi>Buckingham,</hi> That hee was partly perswaded, that the Commons not used to receive, any such charge, or proposition, but from the mouth of their Recorder, attended when hee would speake, wherefore <hi>Iohn Fitz. William</hi> the then Recorder was presently Commanded to desire the votes of the commons to the matter thus twise by the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> proposed. But he being as well furnished with gifts of the mind as of the body a man both learned and honest, with a grave and sober counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made a reiteration of the Dukes duplicate oration adding no more but this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus his grace sayd, and God give your grace to consider of it carefully. But the assembly collecting by the Recorders countenance, and manner of delivery, That he did not well relish the exposition himselfe, still continued silent. Then the Duke againe whispered in the Maiors eares that they stood obstinatly mute, and addressing himselfe againe to the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee sayd, Good friends we are come into you to make a motion, not upon any necessity that you must give your either assent or consent, to the point in question. For what we have proposed, will yee nill yee, might and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7754:117"/>
may bee done, but the onely inducement thereof, was our respectfull love and loving respect towards you: for as much as we would have nothing done of this nature, But that we would first acquaint you with it. And sithence you are to share with us in the blessing of such a businesse, which though you see not or regard not, as it seemes, yet is it most conducible to your peace and the generall quiet.</p>
            <p>We therefore once againe require but your answer yea or no, whether you be resolved, as all the Nobles now at Court are, to accept of the noble Protector Duke <hi>Richard</hi> the onely legitimate Son, of that ever to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably remembred by you and us, <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> for your Soveraigne or not.</p>
            <p>Whereupon those that stood next unto the bar made an indistinct murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, whilst at their backe the skum or dreggs of the City drawne thither by the Dukes followers with themselves, cast up their Caps and with an obstre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous vociferation cryed a <hi>Richard</hi> a <hi>Richard.</hi> And whilst the more sober minded and sufficient Citizens that were before turned backe their heads to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the condition and quality, of those that made the acclamation, themselves nor consenting nor speaking to the poynt in question. The Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> sayd, it was a well becomming expression of their affection, to have all with one consent to embrace the undubitate heire the Royall Protector Duke <hi>Richard</hi> for their Soveraigne Lord and King. And that hee would throughly acquaint him, with their willing for wardnesse to approve him. And then entreating the Maior and his brethren, to be ready the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at <hi>Baynards</hi> Castle where the Duke Protector then resided, to joyne with him to petition the elected <hi>Richard</hi> to accept of this their so freely prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered subjection, hee orderly tooke his leave and departed: and so for that time the company was dissolved.</p>
            <p>In the morning at the place appointed, The Maior with all such whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence hee could perswade or procure, in their Citizens formall habit and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> with all, his favorites and friends, and all the Court Butterflies of that age reassemble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buckingham,</hi> together with information of what was past sendeth notice before unto the Protector (sufficiently instructed cleanly to dissemble his notice of any the prepassages) That the Maior of <hi>London</hi> with all the most of the nobilitie of <hi>England,</hi> were ready (so please his grace) to vouchsafe them the hearing, to present a supplication unto him concerning a businesse of great consequence, to whom the Protector returns answer. That howsoever hee durst not give way to the least suspition, of what his Cosin of <hi>Buckingham</hi> should promove, yet he heartily desired him, to be pleased by that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he sent to returne some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>lightintimation of their intended request<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before his comming unto them should be expected. For that the times were danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the unexpected approach of such a confluence of noble and worthy persons, might give occasion of some doubt to his friends, though not to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of the motive of such an assembly, wherewith <hi>Buckingham</hi> though pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly otherwise perswaded, publickly made a plausible demonstration of the Protectors integritie from affecting any such title, and thereupon returned this reply.</p>
            <p>That the message they were to deliver must be to himselfe in person. And therefore in the name of all the rest, he humbly be sought his grace, to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe them the liberty of admission into his presence. For otherwise they must returne, much discontented to have lost their labours, and the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to have imparted unto him a businesse of that importance, wherein him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7754:117"/>
partly and the republicke in generall had an interest.</p>
            <p>At length as if not well assured of their welmeaning towards him, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector appeares unto them, in an upper gallery, making semblance, as though he would prevent danger by standing in his fort. To whom <hi>Buckingham,</hi> in behalfe of the Maior and the nobility, and others there assembled, makes his humble request; in most respective and reverent manner, that his grace should pardon, what he should declare unto him, and not to be offended with what they with all hearty and unfeined affection desired should by his Highnesse be approved of and embraced.</p>
            <p>Many false fires, are flasht out, before the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> would be brought to discover, to the Protector in plaine termes their cause of comming but though long first, at last he sayd.</p>
            <p>The languishing estate of the Common-wealth did require speedy helpe, which cold no way be procured, except he to whom the government ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of did only rightfully appertaine, would undertake at the respective solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and humble entreaty, both of the nobility, and Gentry, there present to accept of the sole managing as King of the affaires of the kingdome, &amp; accept of their voluntary tender of their due alleageance, where at the Protector starting backe, as if he had seene or heard something most displeasing unto him, passionatly sayd, I little thought, good cosin, that you of all men would have made to me a motion to embrace that which of all things in the world I have thought most agreeable to honesty to decline, far be it from my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to affect, or accept that which without apparent wrong to my deere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased brothers sweet children, and my owne upright conscience, I cannot well approve of: and then being about to proceed further in his premediated trackt of dissimulation. The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> in a seeming abrupt pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion kneeling upon his knee sayd, your grace was pleased to give a free par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of what I should in the name of all this so worthy an assembly relate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, in assurance whereof I have adventured to expresse the hearty respect we beare unto you, as is demonstrated by this (I now feare overforward) ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of dutifull obedience unto you, but herewith I must adde further that it is unanimously resolved on, That the children of your late brother <hi>E.</hi> the fourth, as being generally knowne &amp; proved to be illegitimate, shall never be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the possession of the Crowne of <hi>England.</hi> And therfore if neither respect of your owne well deserving advancement, or regard of the good of the common-wealth will move you to accord to this our no unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable request (wee having gone now so farre with safety wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not retract) wee are resolute, to confer the dignity upon some other of the line of <hi>Lancaster</hi> that shall be more sensible of his own glory, and our good, be not therefore so much your own enemy, and our adversary, but at our so humble entreaty accept of this so presently proffered preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But if (as we shall be most unhappy and disconsolate to heare it) your grace will refuse us, we must then seeke, and hope not to faile to find, one that shall and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, (with halfe these entreaties) undertake to undergoe the danger or hazard, which you may be pleased sinilterly to suppose is in the acceptance. These words in the apprehension of the auditory from <hi>Buckingham</hi> were so emphaticall and patheticall, that they wrought so feelingly upon his passions, That the Protector could not but be contented to expatiate his desire, yet with some change of countenance, and not without seeming reluctation, he did say Since it is manifestly demonstrated unto men, that the whole realme is so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, That they will by no meanes admit my (to me in my particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite most deerely respected Nephewes, my intirely beloved, new deceased

And since the right of inheritance of the Crowne, justly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to me, as to the truly legitimate, and indubitate heire of <hi>Richard Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagenee,</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> my illustrious father.

And will to the uttermost of our poore abilities, endeuor the good and orderly managing thereof. And therewith all descended from the upper Gallery where all the while before he had stayed, and came downe and formally saluted them all, where-with the gyddy headed multitude, made the streets ecchoe, with their loude acclamation of long live King <hi>Richard</hi> our dread Soveraigne Lord. And so the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> tooke his solemn leave, and every man departed to make a des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant at home of the playne song abroad, as every ones severall fancies did minister occasion.</p>

            <p>Vpon the fift day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the King in great state rode thorough the City of <hi>London,</hi> from the Tower to <hi>Westminster,</hi> and on the morrow following, the K. &amp; the Queene came from the Pallace to the great hall, &amp; from thence barefooted upon cloth of raye they went to S. <hi>Peters</hi> Abby at <hi>Westminster,</hi> every one of the nobles &amp; officers of state attending according to their several ranckes &amp; places. The Cardinall sang <hi>Masse,</hi> &amp; after <hi>Pax</hi> the king &amp; Queene descended from before S. <hi>Edwards</hi> shrine, to the high altar before which they were both howseled, having but one host divided betwixt them. Then retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned they both and offred at the shryne, where the king left the Crowne of S. <hi>E.</hi> and tooke his own Crown. And then in order as they came they returned. All ceremonies of solemnitie finished, the King gave licence to all the nobility and others that were thereof desirous to depart to their severall habitations, (except the Lord <hi>Stanley)</hi> respectively giving unto them strict commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at their departure from him, To be carefull to maintaine the truth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to preserve the peace and quiet of the kingdome, and to prevent extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and wrong that otherwise through their negligence might happen unto his subjects, setting them forth a lesson himselfe never meant to learne at least wise practise. For like <hi>Sylla</hi> he commanded others under great penalties to be vertuous and modest, when he himselfe walked the cleane contrary way. The

Northern men well rewarded, are returned home and the king left at leasure, to discover his masked hipocrisie, and at liberty to invent, and put in practise <note place="margin">An. 1484. R. 1.</note> stratagems of death and murther. And as afterwards he ended his time with the best which was his: so began he his raigne with the worst which was the death of his two innocent Nephewes.</p>
            <p>The King and the Queene take their progresse into <hi>Glocester,</hi> to visit in his new honour the place of which he bare the name of his old. By the way he plotteth the manner of the destruction of the two innocent lambes left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in the slaughter-house. For the execution whereof he sent one of his execrable instruments, named <hi>Iohn Greene</hi> with a letter and instructions to Sir <hi>Robert Brackenbury,</hi> Leiftenant of the Tower, a creature of no small credit with him, presently upon the sight thereof, to take order for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching out of the way those two (as he termed them) bastard brats: But the Lieftenant in this (howsoever vehemently suspected as guiltie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like imployments) being honest, both detested the businesse, and denyed to performe the Command, with which answer <hi>Greene</hi> returned to <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke</hi> where the King then was, to whom he related the Lieftenants an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, wherewith the king was doubly perplexed, with the discovery of his intention, and the refusall by him, on whose readinesse hee much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed before. And much discontented he withdrew to his Chamber, where after some vent to his passion, he made enquiry of some of the pages, if any could thinke of a man, that to gaine his Soveraignes favour, would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the losse of a finger or somewhat more, whereupon one of the Pages pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently gave information of a Knight, who to give wing to his ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, which were ever desirous of the Kings imployment, would not be scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulously conscienced, nor would stand much upon the hazard of his limmes to doc his Majestie service, adding withall that he was now in bed in the next chamber, upon this man the K. presently pitcheht; And hastely rifing from the close stoole, (for this Communication was at the time of evacuation, a faire closet and a fit season for such counsell) he went forth into the pallace Chamber, where hee found two brothers Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> and Sir <hi>Iames Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell</hi> in bed together, men of different conditions, but equall comlinesse of feature and countenance, wherein few in those times did exceed them. Sir <hi>Iames</hi> before by the Page fully described to be the undertaker, is singled out and privately conferd withall by the king. And to him hee briefly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth his minde, and the meanes to purchase his perpetuall respect and favour. The Knight as greedy of the imployment, as the King to have it effected, out went the Kings expectation in forwardnesse, undertakes the performance of whatsoever shalbe appointed, whereupon the next morning hee is dispatched with letters mandatorie, to Sir <hi>Robort Brackenbury,</hi> for present surrender up of his command the keyes of the Tower for a time to the bearer, Sir <hi>Iames Tirrell</hi> which was accordingly done.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Iames</hi> before hand had furnished himselfe with actors for such a filthy tragedy, whose names were <hi>Miles Forrest,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Dighton,</hi> a couple of Rake-shames that had beene thoroughly flesht in all villany, And had so often offended the law by shedding of blood, that the custom thereof had taken away the sence of the sinne; so that to cut the throate of a Prince or a Pig was without difference to them. These the second night after his having of the keyes of the Tower, Sir <hi>Iames</hi> imployes to smother the two poore innocents in their bed, which they did, by wrapping hard their pillowes about their heads, and stopping their breath with their bed clothes, which
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7754:120"/>
done, they tooke and buried them under the stayres amongst a heape of stones. From whence they were after removed, in more obscuritie but to a place of Christian buriall, by Sir <hi>Robert Brackenburyes</hi> Chaplaine, whose suddaine death which hapned some few dayes after hindered the discovery of the place. And thereby gave cause of doubt to some, and colour to others, by the credulous folly of a few but the inveterate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of more, afterwards to justifie <hi>Perkyn Warbecks</hi> and others impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturie.</p>
            <p>The tragedy being come to the Catastrophe away poasts Sir <hi>Iames,</hi> (having first taken order for the shipping of his agents for the Lowe Countries) to the King. From whom at first he received gracious counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, good words, and great promises. But was never afterwards pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred or imployed by the King (as perceiving in his lookes some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy for what he had so lately done) But scornd and detested by all that knew the imployment, abandoned by his owne brother, and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable in his owne thoughts. And such is usually the reward of those that pawne their soules to purchase uncertaine preferment, for as good Phisitians affect not poyson, though skilfully sometimes they make use of it, no more doe any the traytor that take advantage of the Treason.</p>
            <p>The King doth now perceive, that he is able enough to subsist of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and without <hi>Buckinghams</hi> ayde or advise, powerfull enough to plot and actuate any requirable project. And therefore having now freed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from any competitors for the Garland by the murther of his two Nephewes: he began by little and little to weane himselfe from <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> and withdrawes his former privacy of conference with him. And first delayes and then denyes to performe the pact and agreement so solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before concluded betwixt them, yet publickly washes his face in every company with all showes of Court holy water, which the Duke wisely observing, (one formerly sufficiently acquainted with his disposition) Thinking it farre better to be enjoyer but of a small loafe, then to have no bread, playes with the King at his owne weapon. At <hi>Glocester</hi> taketh occasion with outward show of all formall respect and former integrity to take his leave of the King and so departed the Court. But they had no sooner severed themselves, but each began to observe the others behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and by meanes of interlopers they were known to misconster and misinterpret each others words, and actions, so that the knot of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie formerly united in treachery, was now easily dissolved by <hi>Ielou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ie;</hi> which was the sooner brought about by this occasion. After the Dukes arrivall at his Castle of <hi>Brecknock</hi> he sent for his prisoner <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> whom he familiarly entertained, and from time to time continued such his kind and respective entertaiment towards him, which the wise Bishop observing, and withall noting the Dukes haughty heart, and ambitious haughtines, he thought it good discretion from thence to take his hint, to make his wisedome the meanes, of his own deliverance, though with the Dukes distruction. For the Bishop besides his profound learning, having often and by alternate proofe of prosperity, and adversity, gotten experience (the mother and mistris of wisdome,) and thereby could discerne the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of polliticke and cunning contrivements, perceiving the Duke so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward to Cope with his conversation, that he would omit no place or time convenient, but he would expresse himselfe in a most affectionate manner to be most desirous to injoy it, the Bishop at times of conference, would so order his Communication that he seemed rather to follow, then lead the Duke into
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7754:120"/>
any discourse, which either concerned the commendation of <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt or <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth. And would therein so temper his speech, that hee would not deliver further, or more, then what hee was assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Duke could not well contradict. But ever modestly without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arrogating or derogating to the Honor of the one or other. But if at any time any passage in their talke intervened that might any way reflect upon the now King, hee would make suddaine stoppes, saying he had beene fomerly too forgetfull that way, and had waded to farre in relation of occurrences in the world, more then did become his Coate, but now hee was resolved to leave those courses, and wholly to apply himselfe to his bookes, and beades, and meditate on the next world. Neverthelesse the Duke after many protestations of secrecy, importuned the Bishop but to expresse his opinion of the condition of King <hi>Richard</hi> and the validity of his tirle to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> telling him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all that hee was resolved to entreat (and presumed he should obtaine it) his faithfull and secret counsell in a busines that neerely concerned him as one upon whose Religious honesty, and every way sufficiency, hee would altogether rely. Adding further that to that end, he had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red leave from the then Protector to have the Bishop committed to his courtesie, whereby hee might with the more conveniency, and safetie, conferre with him thereabouts. And the Bishop might be assured of more safety and respect, then in another place. The Bishop gave him many thankes for this his undeserved favour, desiring the continuance of them But withall told him that Princes were like fire, howsoever at a distance they gave warmth, yet kist they would burne the lippes; And therefore saith hee, I love not to talke of them as being a thing not altogether out of danger. For though the words in themselves deserve no reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, yet are they ever subject to other mens misconstruction, or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretation, and seldome if at any time passe according to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and meaning of the speaker, but as they are taken. But this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded more oyle to the flame of the Dukes desire, to be resolved of the Bishops verdict of the before past proceedings and his judgement of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences to follow. And the more cautious the Bishop was in his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the more eager and earnest was the Duke to be thoroughly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of both, and at length hee prevayled with his importunitie so farre, that one evening after supper sitting privately together, the Duke having engaged his honour, as swearing by his <hi>George,</hi> and his soule, by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his maker to witnesse, that whatsoever at that time the Bishop should deliver unto him, should for ever be buried in silence and never goe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The Bishop stood off no longer but demonstrated at large, that the late Protectors proceedings, were discommendable, his Ambition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable, his bloody designes intolerable, his usurped government tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, and the Honour and quiet of the Kingdome in apparant ieopar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: And then with great earne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nes both of speech and gesture he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther said, Royall Sir I adjure you by the faith you owe to God, by the honorable respect you beare to your progeny, by your oath made to Saint <hi>George</hi> the patron of that honorable order of the Garter whereof you are a deserving companion, by the true affection you carry to your native Countrey, and your due love to vertue and integritie, bee not averse but bravely second that faire and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest course that I shall propose unto your grace. For thereby tyrannous
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:7754:121"/>
usurpation may be suppressed, Iustice advanced, and future peace ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly established, which God of his infinite bountie will vouchsafe to <note place="margin">An. 1484. R. 2.</note> accomplish, if you will with what convenient speed you may, procure or provide a fit and undisparagable match for the eldest daughter of King <hi>Edward</hi> our late King. And if with possibilitie it may be obtained, let him be such a person, as may revnite the long since severed bearings of the red Rose and the White, then will all intestine broyles be pacified: and every one shall freely enjoy the happy benefit of the now so much desired, blessed Concord.</p>
            <p>This speech was not so soone ended, but the Duke elevating his eyes to heaven put of his Cappe; And sayd: To thee oh heavenly father sole giver of every good and perfect gift, from the altar of my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest heart I render all possible praise and thankes, for that thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ast gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ability through thy gracious spirit, to this thy servant, to invent a fiaer meanes, whereby thy glory may be propagated, innocency preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and inhumanity punished, the good &amp; quiet of thy people procured, and every true patriot have just cause to rejoyce in thee. And then putting on his Cap againe he sayd to the Bishop; At what time my brother in law, for I presume it is not unknowne to you that King <hi>Edward</hi> and I did marry two sisters, left this life, I began to revolue with my selfe, how little respect or favour after such my marriage I had received at his hands notwithstanding any so neere affinity besides propension of love to doe him all acceptable service, and his little humanitie showen to me, made me as little reckon of him, and lesse of his children. Then the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe comming into mymind, That that Realme often rueth where children raigne and women beare sway, I could not but be perswaded, That much mischiefe and perturbation would betide the whole Kingdome, if either the young King were suffred to sway the Scepter, or the Queene mother to have the government, and the rather, for that her brothers and children by a former husband, although not extract of very ancient Nobilitie, assumed more unto themselves in managing of the state affaires, then either the deceased Kings brethren or any other Peere of the Realme; whereupon to prevent a further mischiefe, I thought it very requisite, both for the advancement of the publike good, and my owne particular interest, to insinuate and partake with the Duke of <hi>Glocester;</hi> whom I then reputed as free from simulation or dissimulation and as tractable without doing injury, and iust without showing cruelty, as now to my shame I may speake it, and to my griefe I have proved him, to be a perjured dissembler and a pittilesse tyrant. And thereupon I sided with <hi>Glocester:</hi> and by my sole labour and industry (without the least suspicion, I protest of what after hapned) he was at the first Councell held after the death of King <hi>Edward</hi> procured (as partly you my Lord Bishop know) to be made Protector both of King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whereunto he had no sooner attained, but by like policy he got into his custody, his two innocent Nephewes the King and the Duke of <hi>Yorke.</hi> Then he begins to solicite me and sometimes by entreaties he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoreth to perswade, and then againe with minatory words to enforce me, and the Lords present (by constraint as it were) to permit him to take upon him the execution of the Regall state and government of this Kingdome, untill the young King were ripe and able to undergoe the burden thereof, and beare the loade upon his own shoulders at least wise untill he should attaine, to the age of foure and twentie yeeres, which project
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7754:121"/>
of his, in regard the example was without president, And that would be as strange if not more, to have an ambitious mind, to disinantell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of a place of that eminent power of Command one obtained: as for him at that instant to effect it, I seemed not well to relish it, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that I found by the countenance of all there present, he was as then unprovided of seconds at the table, to backe his proposition. He thereupon not altogether unprovided of his baytes to fish with, to give some colourable pretext of reason for what he had moved, he produced ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny seeming authenticke instruments and resolutions, upon depositions of credible witnesses, subscribed by the Civilians and Canonists the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in these times for judgement and learning, by whom it was resolved and so adjudged that the children of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth were to be reputed illegitimate and no way capable of the inheritance of the Crowne; which overture then (unfeinedly I speake it) I thought as reall, and true, as now I know the deponents names were counterfeited, and the whole businesse forged.</p>
            <p>These depositions and resolutions thus by him produced were read, and thoroughly by us at the Councell table debated, and long discussed upon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Protector himselfe stood up and sayd, My Lords as on the one part I and your Lordships are most willing that King <hi>Edwards</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren should receive no injury, so on the other side, I beseech you doe not you bethe occasion that I suffer apparant wrong. For this point being thus cleered that my brothers sonnes are not inheritable, behold me the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable, and undoubted heire of <hi>Richard Plantagenet,</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> my deceased but deere father, who was by authoritie of the Parliament ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged: and so proclaimed lawfull heire of the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> whereupon we silly seduced men, thinking all had beene Gospell that had beene delivered, gave consent, that in regard the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> his son, by reason of the former attainder of the father, besides the obtruded ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimation of him too, was likewise disabled too carry the inheritance: to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the bramble for our King, and Soveraigne Lord: the which I was rather induced to doe, by how much he had often with solemne protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both publike and private, given me his faithfull promise, that the two young infants should no way be abused, but that they should have sufficient assurance for maintenance, such as I and the rest of the nobility should well like and approve of, which how well he hath perfomed judge you, when he was no sooner by my procurement, from a private person made Protector and from a subject sole Soveraigne, but he cast the ladder by, by which he had climed to this preferment, changing his manners with his honours. And not onely denied me to enjoy the liberty of my undoubted right, as touching the Earldome of <hi>Hertford</hi> unjustly detained from me by his predecessor King <hi>Edward.</hi> (And which at our first conference about these proceedings this <hi>Richard</hi> with many execrable oaths and promises had assured me (but kept touch in nothing with me of what was formerly concluded betwixt us. But in liewe thereof I was entertained with flowtes and uncurteous lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, giving out as though I had never furthered but rather hindred his most waighty designes: yet this foule Ingratitude and his undeserved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesse, I patiently for a seasonunder-went. But when I had received cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine notice of the unnaturall murther of his two naturall Nephewes, I was so transported with scorne and indignation, that I had very much to doe to temper my passion, from publicke revenge of their death and my owne disgrace, in his owne Court untill weighing the doubtfulnesse of the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:7754:122"/>
event, I deemed it the safest way, with patience to waite a fitter opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in the meane time, to take out a coppy of his dissimulation, and that I might with the more safty worke upon his owne scene, I framed my cariage and countenance, at all times towards him, in that manner as though I knew no pipe to dance after, but his, never crossing him in any point, nor seeming to dislike or distast (though much against my nature) any thing he moved or did. And by this meanes I obtained libertie to retire my selfe to this place. But in my journey homewards by the way I had many strong conflicts in my mind, which way to begin to worke that I might make this usurper to acknowledge his error, and to pull of the lyons skin from his hoglike backe.</p>
            <p>First I thought with my selfe that there was a faire path beaten for me (he being now by the murther of his tender Nephewes growne despicable to God &amp; all good men) to lay hold of the Garland, in regard there was not one whom I could then call to remembrance, either of power or pretence, sufficient to debar me from enioying it, being no way unprovided of meanes, men or mony for imployment, And in this Conceit I continued a while, untill that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that came into my mind, that to come in by way of conquest would prove both hard and hazardfull; In regard that most of the Nobilitie and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, would oppose me therein, if for no other end or reason, but onely for the preservation of their tenures and titles, which in a conquerors hands are liable to his disposall. And then, and there, that embrions conceit of Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring continued so formles.</p>
            <p>Then my fancy suggested to me that the Lord <hi>Edmond</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> my grandfather was within degrees lineally descended from <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> for <hi>Edmond Beuford</hi> Earle <hi>Moryton</hi> was sonne of <hi>Iohn</hi> surnamed <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> of <hi>Beauford</hi> in <hi>France</hi> which came to the house of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> by <hi>Blaunch</hi> of <hi>Arthoyes</hi> wife to <hi>Edmond</hi> first Earle of <hi>Lancaster</hi> sonne of <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster.</hi> That my mother being his eldest daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I was next heire to <hi>Henry</hi> the 6. And hereupon I set up my rest, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to lay a foundation whereupon to erect my building: But as God would have it, whilst my braines were busie, and as I rode debating with my selfe: how to the best advantage I might set my engines going, betwixt <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Bridgnorth,</hi> I accidentally encountred <hi>Margaret</hi> Countesse of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> the true and only heire of my Grandfathers elder brother <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> who married <hi>Margaret</hi> daughter and heire of Sir <hi>Iohn Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>champ</hi> of <hi>Bletsoe</hi> kinght, By whom he had issue, one onely daughter <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> who married <hi>Edmond</hi> of <hi>Haddam</hi> sonne of <hi>Owen Tewder</hi> by Queene <hi>Katherine</hi> and halfe brother by the mother to King <hi>Henry</hi> the 6. But she was as absolutely forgotten by me as if I had never seene or knowne her. Now she and her sonne <hi>Henry</hi> Earle of <hi>Richmond,</hi> being both cutworke, and percullis, betwixt me and that port, which I must of necessitie passe, if I should at any time attempt to enter into the Court royall of Maiestie, my presupposed title was in my imagination now scarce worth a tittle. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall calling to mind that those inseparable dangers, insupportable cares, and unavoydable troubles, that necessarily awaite upon a Crowne are so imminent &amp; numerous: That no one if he but man can with safety escape, wel undergoe or with patience endure the least of many of them, except by line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all descent the law doe cast it upon him, or he be by Gods especiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence as <hi>David</hi> was preordaind or before appoynted thereunto. And further taking it into consideration, That if I once assumed unto my selfe the swaying of the Scepter, howsoever I might perchance be of abilitie
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7754:122"/>
sufficient to lay hold of it, yet on the one part, I should bee sure to find many foes, but few faithfull friends, (who in this age are all for the most part gone on Pilgrimage and their returne is uncertaine.) And on the other side King <hi>Edwards</hi> Daughters and their Allyes, whose patience so infinitely abused, might incite some furious partakers, or my cousin <hi>Richmond</hi> with his friends and followers, or some discontented Lords (for it would bee an impossible thing to give plenary content to all) would bee ever snatching or snarling at mee, upon every the least occasion, and upon any advantage, so that in all likelyhood my life and livelihood, should bee ever hanging, but by a very slender thread, so that I should never bee secure, but ever in danger of death or deposition: wherefore from thenceforth I concluded with my selfe, to banish out of my thoughts, all ayrie-built Castles, to looke after the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the kingdome, either in my owne right, or to my owne use, and concluded watchfully to attend, if at any time it should please God to make mee his instrument, to relieve the wronged, and to scourge the oppressour; And now I am verily perswaded, that it is the good pleasure of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to make this the meanes by which both may bee to his glory effected, for the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> to take to Wife <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the eldest Daughter of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Humphry</hi> Duke of <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirgham</hi> slain at St. <hi>Albones</hi> 1455.</note> King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth (to bring which orderly to effect,) neither my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, power, or purse shall bee wanting; In respect that by this match, The two houses of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi> at this time so miserably dis-joynted, may bee brought to unitie and conjunction. And whereas my Grandfather <note place="margin">Humphry <hi>slain at</hi> Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, 38. H. 6. 1460.</note> and Father did both lose their lives in abetting the side of <hi>Lancaster;</hi> I will now hazard mine to conjoyne them both hand in hand.</p>
            <p>These words the Duke uttered with that vehement earnestnesse, that the good Bishop, and not without reason was thorowly perswaded, that it was asmuch the love of <hi>Richmond,</hi> as the hatred to <hi>Richard,</hi> that made him make this forward and friendly offer; And from thenceforth afterward hee so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited his discourses with such powerfull and significant words, and prevalent reasons, that hee kept him firme and constant to his first proposition, insomuch that at length by this Bishops advise and procurement of <hi>Reignold Bray</hi> (a Gentleman attending upon the Countesse of <hi>Richmond)</hi> this whole plot is discovered to the Dutchesse, and very well approved of by her; And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently from her, Doctor <hi>Lewis</hi> her Phisitian is imployed to Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth;</hi> who still remained in Sanctuary at <hi>Westminster,</hi> to sound how shee stood inclinable; Who upon the first proposition, before shee would expresse any thing unto the Doctor, shee prostrated her selfe upon her knees, and humbly invoked the blessed Trinitie, to bee propitious to this so much desired Vnitie: And then raising her selfe up shee did professe her selfe, (next unto God) to be much bound to him, or her, that first invented the meanes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to restore my poore children to their right, and redeeme my selfe from that thraldome, and feare wherein now I am; And with great thankes returned to the Doctor, wishing him to assure the contriver thereof whosoever; That if Earle <hi>Richmond</hi> would take his corporall oath, to espouse either her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> or <hi>Cicely,</hi> in case it should please. God <hi>Elizabeth</hi> should dye before that time, assoone as hee had obtained the enjoyment of the Crowne; That shee would not only give hers, and get her Daughters consent to the match: But procure all the Friends and Allyes of her deceased husband King <hi>Edward,</hi> and her owne to take his part, and in all things to give him their best assistance.</p>
            <p>The Mothers thus having expressed their intentions to keepe the game on foot, Doctor <hi>Lewis</hi> preferred to the Queene, a religious and learned Priest,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:7754:123"/>
called <hi>Christopher Vrswicke,</hi> who up on oath taken for secrecy was, as occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should bee offered, to bee imployed in these businesses, so that now <hi>Bray</hi> and <hi>Vrswicke</hi> doe travaile only about home, whilst the Physitian who might doe it with more safetie, and lesse suspition, negotiated in more remote places, first to sound, then to incite, as many of the Nobilitie and Gentrie, as they should discover to bee willing to give their assistance, but alwayes with this caution to offer to treate with none, without making oath first for truth and secrecie.</p>
            <p>In few dayes <hi>Bray</hi> had drawne into confederacy, Sir <hi>Giles Daubeney,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Cheney, Richard Guilford,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Rame,</hi> with some others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vrswicke</hi> likewise for his share, had prevailed with <hi>Hugh Conoway, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Culpepper, Thomas Rooper,</hi> with some others; And in the meane time Doctor <hi>Lewis</hi> was not idle, but had wonne <hi>Edward Courtney,</hi> and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Peter</hi> Bishop of <hi>Exceter:</hi> amongst whom it was carefully agreed upon, that convenient messengers should bee speedily dispatched for <hi>Britannie</hi> to Earle <hi>Richmond,</hi> to acquaint him with the whole proceedings; For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose by the contrivement of <hi>Vrswicke, Hugh Conoway</hi> is imployed from <hi>Plimmouth</hi> with great summes of money.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Rame,</hi> by the advice of <hi>Bray,</hi> is with like instructions sent out of <hi>Kent</hi> by <hi>Callice,</hi> both which within the space of little more then an houre, though divers wayes, the one most part by Sea, the other most part by land, came to the presence of the Earle, who graciously received them, and gladly embraced both the concord and condition.</p>
            <p>The Earle acquaints the Duke of <hi>Britanny,</hi> both with the plot and the confederation: earnestly imploring his advise and ayde, which the Duke as readily promised, as really performed; Howsoever <hi>Hutton</hi> Embassadour from King <hi>Richard,</hi> had endevoured to preoccupate the Scene, and in his Masters name, had both by private Letters, and many proffers of much money, and more courtesies laboured the Duke for the Earles restraint; But to little or no purpose.</p>
            <p>The Earle thus encouraged, returnes <hi>Connoway</hi> and <hi>Rames</hi> by the same way they came, to give notice of his speedy repaire, with ample instructions, for the manner of preparation against his approach to be made; Whereupon the Confederates in all places provide such as had Castles or Piles of strength furnish them with men and amunition; And others use their best meanes, that money and men may bee got in readinesse, against the Earles arrivall.</p>
            <p>Bishop <hi>Morton</hi> who had gained opportunitie against the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghams</hi> will, to convey himselfe into the <hi>Lowe-Countryes,</hi> is not slacke by Letters and private messages, to conjure all such as hee knew, either to hate or envy King <hi>Richard,</hi> or to have loved King <hi>Edward,</hi> to lay to their helping hands with all their might in this conjuration.</p>
            <p>Now whether amongst so many (through some false brothers treachery, or out of his watchfull jelousie over <hi>Buckingham</hi> it is uncertaine.) But King <hi>Richard</hi> hath intelligence of the designe, and politickly dissembleth it, but secretly giveth order as it were but to take a muster, to draw his forces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, amongst whom hee suddenly comes, and having appointed his carriages to follow him, hee marcheth away without acquainting any of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders with any particular place whither hee lead these forces; In the meane time first by proffer of friendship, by faire termes, the King did soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Dukes presence at <hi>London,</hi> where the King kept his standing house; But receiving from him, but delatory put offs; The King then sent a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory message, by the tye of his alleageance to come away; which was
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:7754:123"/>
returned with this resolute answer, That hee would not (if hee could avoid it) have any conversation with an ungratefull per jured inhumane butcher of his owne flesh and blood, so that now preparation to offend and defend by the sword is made on both parts.</p>
            <p>The King holds on his march, whereupon all the conjurators in every quarter are in overt commotion, <hi>Thomas</hi> Marquesse <hi>Dorset</hi> (preserved from slaughter by the only favour of Sir <hi>Thomas Lovell</hi> against the Kings will) forsaketh Sanctuarie, and in <hi>York-shire</hi> laboureth to raise forces.</p>
            <p>The two <hi>Courtneys</hi> in <hi>Devon</hi> and <hi>Cornwall</hi> take the same course, and they are seconded in <hi>Kent</hi> by <hi>Guilford</hi> and <hi>Rame,</hi> so that civill combustion is in every quarter of the Realme: King <hi>Richard</hi> notwithstanding severs not his forces, but keepes on his march towards <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who having notice thereof, both readily, and willingly setteth forward, bending his course tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Forrest of <hi>Deane,</hi> intending at <hi>Glocester</hi> to have passed <hi>Severne,</hi> and so to have joyned forces with the two <hi>Courtneys,</hi> and the Westerne Confederates, but by the long continuance of wet weather, the waters thereabouts were risen so high, that <hi>Severne</hi> was broken out, and had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowne all the Countries: so that it was a thing impossible for the Dukes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to bee transported, which the Welch-men (drawne thither more for feare then love) tooke advantage of, saying it was a prodigious token, of their ill successe in the enterprise, and secretly by night slipt away from him, whose example the residue followed, so that the Duke upon this disbanding, was left to shift by himselfe, whereupon hee dismist all his followers, and without or Page or Foot-man, repayred to the house of one <hi>Humphry Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,</hi> who dwelt neere <hi>Shrowsbury,</hi> presuming there he might safely lodge in obscurity, untill better fortune should smile, the rather for that the many extraordinary favours, formerly done to the said <hi>Bannister</hi> and his father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, might justly challenge willing entertainment during his secret stay there, if not more.</p>
            <p>The newes of this disaster, added wings to the other conjurators to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperse their powers and flye, some to Sanctuary, others to unknowne places, all of them making the best shift they could to escape: but they sped best which conveyed themselves into <hi>Britanny;</hi> Amongst whom the Marquesse <hi>Dorset, John</hi> Lord <hi>Wells,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Exceter,</hi> and his brother Sir <hi>John Bourchier,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Woodvile,</hi> brother to Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Willoughby,</hi> Sir <hi>Giles Daubeney,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Arundell,</hi> Sir <hi>John Cheney</hi> and his two brethren, Sir <hi>William Barckley,</hi> Sir <hi>William Brandon</hi> and his Brother <hi>Thomas,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Egmond, Hollowell</hi> and <hi>Poynings</hi> Captaines were chiefe.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> having intelligence that the enemy was fled, sent order pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, to lay all the Ports, with strict charge, that none should goe on borde, or come on shore, without especiall warrant.</p>
            <p>Hee likewise made publick Proclamation, that if any one could bring ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> (who was now proclaimed Traitour, and all his lands and goods seized into the Kings hands) so that the Duke might bee apprehended, if the person were a bondman hee should bee manumit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if a freeman, hee should have a generall pardon, and a thousand pound currant English coyne.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things are thus in agitation, King <hi>Richard</hi> hath information from <hi>Hutton</hi> his Leiger Embassadour in <hi>Britaine,</hi> That the Duke thereof not only refused to keepe the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> in restraint of libertie; Bu, was seeming forward, to give him his assistance, to prosecute his intendmentt
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:7754:124"/>
which was to worke some exploit in <hi>England:</hi> Wherefore the King tooke especiall order, for the present rigging, and preparing his Navy, to stop, if possible, the Earles landing in any Port of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>interim,</hi> whether feare to offend the law, or greedy Covetousnesse to gaine the thousand pounds, it is yet disputable, but <hi>Bannister</hi> like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull servant perfidiously discovered his Master the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to <hi>Iohn Mitton</hi> then high Sheriffe of <hi>Shropshire,</hi> who thereupon apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, in a little Grove neere <hi>Bannisters</hi> dwelling house, and conveyed him to <hi>Shrowsbury</hi> where King <hi>Richard</hi> lay, from whence upon All-Soules day, hee was conveyed to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and then and there without arraignment or legall proceedings, in the Market-place beheaded.</p>
            <p>Whether <hi>Bannister</hi> received his proclaimed reward is uncertaine: but that Gods judgements appeared afterwards against him, and his is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, for hee was afterwards hanged for man-slaughter, his eldest daughter is debauncht by one of his Carters, and his sonne and heire in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate lunacy became his owne butcher, and was so found by the Coruors inquest.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was Earle of <hi>Stafford, Hereford, Northampton,</hi> Lord of <hi>Brecknocke, Kimbolton,</hi> and <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> and high Constable of <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>Vpon the twelfth day of October, the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> with fourtie ships and five thousand waged <hi>Britons</hi> tooke the Seas; But that evening by the rage of an impetuous tempest, the whole Navy was dispersed; The ship wherein the Earle was, with one only little Barke, after they had endured the rage of the tempest, eight and fourty houres, was driven upon the coast of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> where hee giveth expresse commandement, that none should dare to take land untill the fleet were drawne together.</p>
            <p>But after hee had huld up and downe the shore, by the space of a day and a night, and never a Vessell appearing, observing an hourely encrease of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med souldiers upon the Coasts by <hi>Poole,</hi> being assured they were none of his partakers, because no tokens before agreed upon, at his approach to bee used, were presented: The wind blowing a fresh gale, the Earle hoisteth sayle, and returning toward <hi>France,</hi> arrived in <hi>Normandy;</hi> From whence he dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth messengers to the French King <hi>Charles</hi> the eight, by whom hee readily received a safe conduct, together with a liberall quantitie of French Crowns, to beare his charges on the way, whereupon the Earle sent his shipping about, whilst hee by easie journies came by land into <hi>Brittaine,</hi> where hee received the newes of the Duke of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> death, and the disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Confederates forces, which somewhat troubled him at first; But afterwards hee was much comforted, at the sight of the Marquesse <hi>Dorset,</hi> and those brave Commanders that were come with him; And presently they enter into consultation, what course was to bee taken in their beginning, and progresse of the intended action, amongst whom it was then generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:7754:124"/>
That King <hi>Richard</hi> as a Tyrant and a Traitour should be proscribed.</p>

            <p>This thus concluded on, upon Christmasse day before the high Altar, in the great Church of <hi>Reimes,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> gave oath to marry the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> immediatly after hee was quietly seated in the government of <hi>England;</hi> And thereupon all the Lords and Knights there present, (the Bishop of <hi>Exceter</hi> showing them the way,) did doe him homage; And in the same place, each to other religiously did vow, taking the Sacrament there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, never to surcease prosecuting warre against <hi>Richard</hi> the Vsurper, untill his deposition or destruction.</p>

of his bed, in the darke, and catching his sword (which alwayes naked stucke by his side) hee would goe distractedly about the Chamber, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where seeking to find out the cause of his owne occasioned disquiet; And in the day time hee alwayes would hold his hand upon his Pony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, as though hee would not bee behind-hand, to requite the stroke of a sword with a stabbe: his braines were still working, and his cogitations, hammering out strange stratagems for Massacres.</p>
            <p>There must be no stone left unremoved, whereupon <hi>Richmon</hi> might have footing: Embassadours are sent to the Duke of <hi>Britaine</hi> with instructions upon any termes to procure, or purchase his Person, to bee delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; But the Duke by extremitie of sicknesse was falne into that weaknesse, that the Embassadours could have no audience; Whereupon they addressed themselves to <hi>Peter Landoyes,</hi> chiefe Treasurer to the Duke, and his great Favourite; They having found out the length of his foot, by the experience of other mens successe, that negotiated with him; They so annointed him with oyle of Angels, and large promises, of the King of <hi>Englands</hi> ready willingnesse to make more ample satisfaction, for any cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie therein by him to be done. That he resolutely undertaketh that the Kings pleasure shall bee in that point procured, what injoyned this Treasurer, that at Saint <hi>Mallowes</hi> not long before, had countermined King <hi>Richards</hi> Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and preserved the Earle from the danger of the plotte; That now hee should undertake, to ingulph him in that quagmire, from whence so lately hee had freed him, cannot easily bee conjectured, except that the eminencie of his place (farre transcending his descent or desert,) had brought him into the generall hatred of those, whom either hee by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward power with the Duke, had any wayes injured, (a course too common amongst those of like condition and qualitie) or otherwise, had not given that fulnesse of content, that was expected; And thrust him into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his betters by birth, that scorned to have such a bubble to take place before them, or into the envie of all such that would, but could not obtaine like favour and preferment, or into the hatred of the Commons, who sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or never thinke, or speake well of Officers in like place, that purchase their Masters favours by filling his coffers, and emptying their purses; And that hee could not devise a better meanes, how to arme himselfe strongly against the machinations and excursions, of such incertaine enemies, but by the friendship and protection, of so potent a Monarch, as the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was, the validitie of whose gold, and the power of whose arme, might purchase or procure his freedome or sasetie, if at any time thereafter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached.</p>
            <p>Whilst the Treasurer is plotting and placing his engines, to make delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the merchandise, as afore bought and sold. God who alwayes provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for the deliverance out of danger, for those that trust in him, had so appointed, that <hi>Christopher Vrswicke</hi> is sent out of <hi>Flaunders,</hi> from <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> (who by Gods especiall care and providence, was ever mindfull, and carefully watchfull of the Earle of <hi>Richmonds</hi> prosperous proceeding) to forewarne the Earle of the neere and certaine perill hee was in, and to acquaint him, both with the plot, and the meanes to prevent it. The Earle quickly resenteth it, and presently dispatcheth <hi>Vrswicke</hi> to the French King, to crave the continuance of his gracious favour, and againe to grant him safe passage thorow his Dominions. <hi>Vrswicke</hi> was no sooner gone on his way, but the Earle (making no more, then needs must, acquainted with his intention,) having procured a guide by unfrequented wayes, to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7754:125"/>
conduct him into <hi>France,</hi> gave private directions to the Earle of <hi>Penbrooke,</hi> to make an overture, to drawe his forces towards the Duke of <hi>Britaine</hi> (who by this time had beene somewhat recovered of his maladie, and was retired to take the ayre, neere the borders of <hi>France,)</hi> That hee (as though so by him desired) might make view of them. But assoone as ever they came neere any the confines of <hi>France,</hi> hee should with all convenient speed, make entrance thereinto, and attend further directions. The Earle of <hi>Pembrooke</hi> punctually followed his directions, and safely arrived in the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>Anjou,</hi> where they made their randevow; <hi>Richmond</hi> with only five in his company, himselfe disguised like an ordinary Serving-man, through Woods and by-wayes, came to <hi>Angeirs,</hi> whither some of his retinue were gotten before, and attended his comming; From thence hee writeth to the Duke of <hi>Britaine,</hi> excusing his so sudden, and unmannerly departure, occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through his certaine danger, (if not thus avoided) by the plot aforesaid.</p>
            <p>Some few dayes after his departure, the Treasurer with a selected com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of souldiers, under the conduct of <hi>John Vitry (Landoys</hi> his onely creature and counsellour, who gave forth by the way, that these men were waged for the ayde of the Earle of <hi>Richmond:</hi> and to that purpose had <hi>Vitry</hi> formerly written to the Earle) came to <hi>Vans,</hi> where hearing of the Earles sudden departure, hee sent out his Vauntcorriers into every quarter to apprehend and stay him: but they lost their labours.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Edward Woodvile</hi> and Captaine <hi>Poynings</hi> with their Companies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left behind in <hi>Vans,</hi> had beene in great hazard, to have beene distressed, but their discreet behaviour, both then and before, had gotten a good opinion amongst the Townsmen, that they quietly permitted their stay amongst them, untill they had informed the Duke by the meanes of the Chancellour, who was their friend, and <hi>Landoys</hi> antagonist of their estate, who much displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, with the harsh usage of the Earle by <hi>Landoys;</hi> out of a noble and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable disposition, furnished them not only with money to discharge their debts in the Towne, but also with carriages, and all necessaries for their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly accommodation in their march to the Earle of <hi>Richmond:</hi> whither with a safe conduct hee sent them, where they safely arrived.</p>
            <p>The Earle returnes thankes to the Duke, and with an authenticall Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby the Earle and all the Gentlemen present, had subscribed to the repayment of the money lent, and satisfaction of all things else, by those Companyes received, sends him a more ample and perfect remonstrance of the Treasurers trechery, which afterwards gave just occasion to the Duke of <hi>Britaines</hi> kinred, (who were by Decree of the King, and all the Peeres of <hi>France,</hi> in regard of the Dukes infirmitie, to manage the affaires of the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,) to question <hi>Landoys</hi> for that, and other overbold actions of his, to his after-overthrow; For hee and his Favourite <hi>John Vitry,</hi> (upon the just com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Chancellour, and the unappeasable fury of the inraged multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) had their processe legally made against them, and were accordingly hanged.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> admitted to the presence of the French King, acquaints him with his intention, and laying claime to the Crowne of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and his meanes of prosecution thereof, and requesteth his amitie and assistance; Both which King <hi>Charles</hi> faithfully promised, and as effectually performed to his great honour.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>interim, Richmond</hi> and his retinue, are honourably entertained, and bountifully feasted in the French Court, and many proffers of matches to the young English Bachelers there made, but none succeeded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:7754:126"/>
Whilst the Earle is thus attending in the French Court, <hi>John Vere</hi> Earle of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who had long beene Prisoner in the Castle of <hi>Hams,</hi> had so preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently perswaded with <hi>James Blunt,</hi> Captaine of the Fortresse, and Sir <hi>John Fortescue,</hi> Porter of the Towne of <hi>Callice,</hi> that they not only gave him leave to take his owne liberty, but accompanied him to the Earle of <hi>Richmond,</hi> of whom they are joyfully welcommed, and to him Captaine <hi>Blunt</hi> gives assurance, that the Fortresse did remaine only at his devotion.</p>
            <p>To the Earle at this time there resorted divers young Gentlemen, that were students in the Vniversity of <hi>Paris,</hi> proffering him their service, amongst whom was <hi>Richard Fox,</hi> at that time very famous for good Clerk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and faire carriage, to whom the Earle then gave entertainment, and then advised with him in all his affaires, but afterwards upon proofe of his good abilities, he made him one of his most privy Councell.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> being informed, that his Chapmen could not compasse his so much desired merchandize in <hi>Britaine,</hi> and that <hi>Richmond</hi> was safe, and fairely entertained in the French Kings Court, hee resolved not to leave any thing undone, how vile and nefarious soever, that might further him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate his Adversary; And being perswaded that hee could by any meanes anticipate the Earle from matching with his Neece <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> And being so flesht in villany, that custome in him had taken away all sence of sinning, This downright instrument of the Divell, resolveth to ridde his hands of <hi>Anne</hi> his Queene, and as it were to win the prize from all precedent Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, in being guiltlesse of no impietie, hee attempteth the marriage of his Neece, his Queene being yet living; But shee good Lady shall bee quickly made sure enough, from hindring his despicable designe, in joyning incest to murther; And thus resolved, cloking his wolvish condition, under the vaile of innocent well-meaning, this Monster of men, backt by the divell and his dissembling lookes, endevoureth to perswade the Queene of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> his Brothers Widow, that hee most entirely affected her pleasure, and her childrens preferment, and to obtaine her good opinion, would not only pardon the Earle <hi>Dorset,</hi> but promote him, and all their kinred to Honour, and prime offices of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>So farre hee prevailed with this meere pittifull Queene, that shee had quite forgotten the murther of her innocent infants; the butchering of her owne Brother, Sonne, and kinsfolkes, the calumny of her royall husband, the asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of adultery obtruded to her selfe, the imputation of bastardy layd to her Daughters; And her firme faith plighted to the contrary to the Dutchesse of <hi>Richmond,</hi> &amp; the assurance thereby of her elder daughters preferment, upon K. <hi>Richards</hi> glosing speeches, was contented first to commit her daughters, to the custody of him that was author, and actor of all these calumniations and cruelties; and afterwards by Letters mandatory, to solicite her Sonne the Marquesse of <hi>Dorset,</hi> to desert the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> and to encline to King <hi>Richard,</hi> who shee assured him, had not only granted him, his free and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pardon, but had provided honourably to preferre him upon his returne.</p>
            <p>This done, King <hi>Richard</hi> with great solemnitie, and formall show of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie affections (the surest ginnes to catch women and rattlebraines) entertaineth the abused Mother, and seduced Daughters; And presently takes order to make one Saint the more in heaven by sending his Wife thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before her time, but how or by what meanes it is not made manifest.</p>
            <p>Shee is with all solemnity, which the shortnesse of time to prepare would permit, interred at Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church in <hi>Westminster,</hi> where some few forced teares for a show, are wrung from his eyes at the Funerall, whilst
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:7754:126"/>
his thoughts are plotting, how to compasse incestuous copulation, with his owne Brothers Daughter, whom hee immoderately visiteth, and entertaines <note place="margin">An. 1484 R. 1.</note> with all varieties of pompous pleasures, as it were by such musicke, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare her affection the sooner to admit of his love-suite; But her harmelesse innocencie, not diving into his villanous purposes, takes all things from him as honourable courtesies.</p>
            <p>Now only feare to lose that little good Opinion which the Common-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had cast away upon him, induced thereunto by his late formall show of repentance, and protestation of his heartie detestation of his former bloody course of life did with-hold this monster of man-kind, as yet to discover his beastly desire, which was to purchase his pleasure by rape, if not otherwise procurable; But for that it behoved him to labour to prevent the growing storme, threatned from beyond the Seas, and to hinder the further growth of his enemies forces at home, against his will hee prorogues the execution of his desires, and leaves love-matters untill another season.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Stanley</hi> is commanded, to levie all his forces for the Kings aide, as he will justifie his integritie to him; Neverthelesse cannot be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to go downe into his Countrey, untill hee had left <hi>George</hi> Lord <hi>Strange,</hi> his first begotten sonne, as a sure pledge of his love and loyaltie be hind him.</p>
            <p>The surrender of the Castle of <hi>Hammes</hi> to the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> by Captaine <hi>Blount,</hi> is come to the eares of King <hi>Richard,</hi> who presently gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth order to the garrison of <hi>Callice,</hi> and the Forts adjoyning, to reduce the same, which they accordingly attempted; But the Captaine at his departure (having left his wife therein) had sufficiently furnished it, to withstand any assault, untill reliefe might with conveniency be sent unto it.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> having notice of the siege sendeth the Earle of <hi>Oxford</hi> with some forces to remove it, or relieve the besieged.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Brandon,</hi> a servant of the Earle of <hi>Oxford,</hi> with thirty resolute souldiers, find the meanes to enter into the Castle, carrying with them such amunition, as was then most wanting, whilst the Earle of <hi>Oxford</hi> with his other forces are marching thither, upon notice whereof, the <hi>Callicians</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the besieged, that if they would surrender the Castle, all that were within it, should have faire and noble quarter, with free liberty to depart, with bagge and baggage, which was accordingly readily embraced, being the only end of the Earle of <hi>Oxfords</hi> journey; which was to redeeme his friends, in especiall the Genlewomen in the Castle out of danger; And then leaving the Castle cleane bare, without either men, amunition, or ordnance, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated in safetie to the Earle of <hi>Richmond.</hi>

But report being come into <hi>Britaine,</hi> that the Vsurper laboured the speedy making up of a match betwixt him, and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and <note place="margin">An. 1484.

            <p>A common report is raised, that <hi>Rice ap Thomas,</hi> and <hi>John Savage</hi> stood out for King <hi>Richard,</hi> which gave some occasion of mistrust to <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond;</hi> But the trouble was lessened, when he was resolved by Captaine <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold Butler,</hi> that the Earle of <hi>Penbrooke</hi> with all his retinue were upon the way to joyne with the Earle of <hi>Richmond.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Earles skowts bring in word, that Sir <hi>Robert Harbert</hi> and <hi>Rice ap Thomas,</hi> were ready with a great power to stop his passage; Whereupon hee dispatched messengers with Letters to his Mother and Friends, to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them of all occurrences, since his safe arrivall, and to acquaint them with his intention, to passe <hi>Severne</hi> at <hi>Shrowsbury,</hi> and from thence to march directly for <hi>London;</hi> and then prepares himselfe for the encounter; And in his march is saluted by <hi>Rice ap Thomas,</hi> who with a valiant crew of souldiers offers their service, so as Earle <hi>Henry</hi> will pledge his faith to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his promise formerly intimated by Letter, which was, that after hee had obtained the Crowne, <hi>Richmond</hi> should make and appoint <hi>Rice</hi> sole governour of <hi>Wales,</hi> which was assented unto, and accordingly afterwards performed.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Gilbert Talbot</hi> that evening, with all the Earle of <hi>Shrowsburyes</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, the Earle himselfe being the Kings Ward, with about two thousand well appointed men came and joyned with <hi>Richmond.</hi>

            <p>The Lord <hi>Stanly</hi> in the way with 5000. men, had taken his lodging at the towne of <hi>Leicester;</hi> But hearing of Earle <hi>Henryes</hi> march that way he quit the

            <p>Although at first hee did neglect to stop their proceedings, yet when hee understood that those forces, which hee had appointed to impeach their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, had only suffered them uninterupted to passe, but were now joyned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Earle <hi>Henry;</hi> King <hi>Richard</hi> began when it was somewhat with the latest, to looke about him, posted directions to the Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Surry,</hi> with Sir <hi>Thomas Brackenbury</hi> the Lieutenant of the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and some others his well-willers, with all speed, and forces possible, to repaire unto him to <hi>Lutterworth;</hi> King <hi>Richard</hi> is infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by his vaunt-curriors, that <hi>Richmond</hi> was encamped at <hi>Liechfield,</hi> and from thence would remove to <hi>Leicester,</hi> wherefore hee upon the arrivall of his power, marched towards his enemies.</p>

            <p>The Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> hereupon by night, and secretly repayreth to his Father-in-law, the Lord <hi>Stanley,</hi> with whom and his Brother, having consulted of those things, that might conduce most to his better proceedings, hee returneth (but not without some hazard,) to his company which he found much encreased and encouraged, by the accession of Sir <hi>John Savage,</hi> Sir <hi>Bryan Stanford,</hi> and Sir <hi>Simon Digby,</hi> with their severall Companies of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and expert souldiers.</p>

            <p>The forward that was led by the Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> which consisted of one thousand two hundred Bow-men, flancked with two hundred Curasseires, under the conduct of the Earle of <hi>Surrey.</hi> The battaile King <hi>Richard</hi> led in person, which consisted of a thousand Bill-men, empaled with two thousand Pike.</p>
            <p>The rereguard was led by Sir <hi>Thomas Brackenbury,</hi> consisting of two thousand mingled weapons, with two wings of horse-men, containing fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene hundred, all of them cast into square manuples, still expecting the Lord <hi>Stanleys</hi> presence, who with two thousand most of them horse-men, were not set out of their quarter, when the forlorne hope of the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> had begun to skirmish, the foot-men under the leading of Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> being upon their March, were enforced as hee pretended, to avoid a myrie bogge that lay betwixt them and the King, and to avoyd the danger of being charged, before they should have opportunitie to joyne with hime to fetch a compasse about, by that meanes, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting a mist before the Kings eyes, that hee might not palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly perceive their intention, to give assistance to the Earle of <hi>Richmond;</hi>

            <p>The Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> very early in the morning had sent unto his Father-in-law, desiring his present repaire; And the rather for that hee wanted, his more able direction to deraigne his battaile: But hee was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered from him, that no ayde or direction must bee expected from him, more then that hee advised him, with all possible speed to give the onset, and aftet the battaile should bee joyned, hee and his Brother would second the battell; Earle <hi>Henry</hi> somewhat staggering at the first at the answer, made a vertue of a necessitie, and tooke counsell of his owne Commanders; And by their advise, because the weaknesse of their body, should not bee presently discerned, (for their numbers did but little exceed the halfe of the Kings,) Their Voward was made very open and thin, of which <hi>John</hi> Earle of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> had the leading; The Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> in person led the battell, Sir <hi>Gilbert Talbot</hi> commanding the right wing, and Sir <hi>John Savage</hi> the leaft, whose souldiers being all alike clad, in white coates of cloth or frize, and hoods of the same, by the reflection of the Sonne upon them, made them appeare in the view of their Adversaries double their number. The rereguard was governed by the Earle of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brooke,</hi> which consisted most of horse, and some Pike, and blacke Bills.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> having drawne his chiefe Leaders about him; And pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing himselfe in that manner, as that hee might bee the better heard, saith;</p>

            <p>What should move this but halfe codled souldier; This linsie-woolsie Welchman with a crew of poore rakeshame runnagates to attempt thus to robbe mee of my Crowne, and you of your liberties and lives; I know not, except the divell owe his ambitious pride a shame, and hath brought him this day to your hands to receive your condigne chastisement for it. The beggerly <hi>Britons,</hi> and faint-hearted French-men, what further aime have they, then to make prey on your Patrimonies, to abuse your wives and daughters, and to enrich themselves by your losses, and to extirpate your posterities.</p>
            <p>For prevention of all which, let us this day but show our selves the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of our Ancestors valours: and but fight like men, and you shall quickly make them run like cravens, or die like dogs.</p>
            <p>For my part, take the word of your Prince, I am thorowly resolved, either this day to be a Conquerour, or else to lose my life in quest of victory; And so Saint <hi>George</hi> let us charge with courage.</p>
            <p>But these words were not powerfull enough, to worke any great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the hearts of the souldiers, by reason they were delivered

not with that alacritie of spirit he was wont in astrained composure of his countenance, as being dejected by the remembrance of his horrid dreames which the gnawing of his conscience had suggested in his sleepe that night, which made it appeare that he had no great hope to prevaile, whatsoever he said, or shewed.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> unwilling to be behind hand, in orderly direction, made unto his men this exhortation.</p>
            <p>If ever God gave victory to his servants fighting in a just quarrell, or gave ayde to those, that endevoured the welfare, of the Common-wealth, or gave <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Richmonds</hi> ex hertation.</note> a blessing to such as laboured the suppression of a tyrannous usurper, the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of innocent blood-shedding, or the just punishment of fratricide, and most execrable treason.</p>
            <p>We neede not then, (deere Countrymen and my kind companions in armes) make any doubt, but that he will be pleased this day to give us a glorious victory, and give us just occasion to triumph in the Conquest over this usurping bloud-sucker.</p>
            <p>It is not (I presume) unknowne to any one of you that our cause is just, for he against whom we oppose (that wrongfully stileth himselfe King,) unjustly detaineth from me the Scepter of this Kingdome, which injustice was initiated with blood, by the unnaturall murther of his brother, nephewes, and neerest allyes, continued by machivilian plots; and sinister practises, to betray the nobility and gentry to the losse of their lives, the confiscation of their goods, seizure of their lands, disinheriting of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and finall extirpation of their families, as having no care of his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, neither reverencing God nor respecting man. Am not I and you, (nay all the truehearted nobilitie of this kingdome) woefull witnesses of this his so insupportable tyranny, doe we not every day and houre, more and more sustaine the wounds, contusions and dislocations that this <hi>Richard</hi> by his bloody raigne &amp; tyrannous usurpation hath made in the body of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and shall we part of her members, as if not sensible of her disgraces, or injuries, sit still, and silently suffer the ravenous bore of the Forrest, to roote up the sweete Vine of peace of this Kingdome and prey upon our rightfull inheritance? And as it were willingly lay downe our necks to carry the servile yoke of his imperious cruelty, and insolent usurpation, the Lord forbid.</p>
            <p>What are his associate confederates, but of like feather, such as his bare donation without right, or title wrongfully usurpe, as he doth the Crowne from me, so they your patrimony and unquestionable right from you and yours without right or colour-like right.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore plucke up our spirits, and setting all feare and diffidence a part, let us like faithfull fellowes and loving friends in Gods name joyne hand and heart; to quell this monster of men and either make in this dayes action the date of our life honourable, or the beginning of our victorie triumphant. And God who is the onely giver of victory will, I faithfully beleeve, looke upon the justnesse of the cause, and give successe accordingly unto us.</p>
            <p>It is not multitude, but vnited hearts for a just quarrell that procures Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, and the God of glory can show his power, through our weakenesse, the lesse our numbers, the more our renowne, if we be victors, and if we dye (as we all owe God a death) in this so well an intended action, neither rust of time which devoureth all things else, nor any thing whatsoever, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar us from a perpetuitie of life here on earth after death, and a Crowne of everlasting glory in heaven.</p>

This ingratefull wretch hath deffiddnce in all men, and who then can have confidence in him? Let us therefore like true <hi>Heroes</hi> against a tyrant, honest hearted men against a traytor, and true patriots against an usurper, like free borne undanted spirits against the monster of the earth, both in birth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior, being from his infancy branded for a stigmaticke, expresse our selves noble, honest, true hearted and valiant: goe forward then, advance our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, incite your courages, and in the name of God cry Saint <hi>George</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> and God I doubt not will give us his blessing, and make the day ours.

            <p>These words were with gesture of body and alacritie of spirit, so confidently delivered, that it drew from the hearers teares of joy: and put such reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution into their hearts, that they presently exprest the same, in their present falling to handle their armes, and by the way, to move, encourage, animate one an other, to buye, and vye for the victory bravely, or to rate and sell their lives highly deerly. And therewith advance, and giving a great shout to shew their willingnesse, upon the first sight of the enemy let flye a volly of shafts so close and home that King <hi>Richards</hi> voward hasted though against their wills to joyne to be out of the danger of a second shower.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Oxford</hi> was as ready for the encounter and fearing to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantaged by the thinnesse of his front, he gave the word that no man should straggle but follow his leader, and Commanded the fronters not to advance further nor otherwise then he gave direction, by which discipline they were presently falne into a close body: And so stood firme in which time Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Stanley</hi> had time to draw up his men likewise, to encrease the length of the van; which gave them occasion on the other side, that were not well affected to the service, to slacke their pace and spare their bow-strings: which the Earle of <hi>Oxford</hi> well observing, being encouraged by the approvement of the course, by the Lord <hi>Stanley</hi> who was now come to the for-ward, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly profest himselfe to wish well to his sonne in lawes proceedings, gave on with a brave charge, and followed it so home, that the adverse part not able, (or at lest not willing) to endure the shock (for the cause of quarrell in a Souldier encreaseth the courage, or abateth the edge of resolution) gave grownd which moved King <hi>Richard</hi> to bring on the maine battaile. And with a desperat resolution, entred so farre into the enemies battaile, that with his own hands hee slew Sir <hi>William Brandon, Richmonds</hi> chiefe stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard bearer, and unhorst Sir <hi>Iohn Cheney</hi> a strong and stout man at armes. And at length encountring, with the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> enterchanged some buffets. But <hi>Henry</hi> ayded by the divine helpe, and favoured with the upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his cause, with stood <hi>Richards</hi> forceable assault. But whilst the armies on both sides stood striving in a doubtfull hazard who should win the price, Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> with three thousand fresh men crying S. <hi>George,</hi> a <hi>Richmond,</hi> joyned with his brothers Souldiers, &amp; brake into King <hi>Richards</hi> battayle, who thereupon fled incontinently leaving their King behind to make a bloody catastrophe of his slaughterly raigne, who throughly enraged furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously fighting without discretion or ability to prevaile, he fell under the sword of his enemies.</p>
            <p>The rumor of his death, and the rowting of the battaile gave occasion to the reregard Commanded by <hi>Henry</hi> Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> who rather wished, then expected what did befall, to submit without striking stroke, whereby the victory fell to the Earle <hi>Richmonds</hi> part, who upon certainty thereof instantly in most religious divotion, gave order for publicke thanks gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:7754:129"/>
to God for their happy preservation, and he himselfe that gave the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept made himselfe the patterne therein: alighting from his horse, and knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon his knees first privatly to himselfe, and then publickly with the rest gave glory to his maker.</p>
            <p>There were not above one thousand slaine on both sides, the cheife of whom was <hi>Iohn,</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> who was often warned, and much laboured that day to forbeare the field; in regard there was found written upon his tent-dore.</p>

            <p>There were not on the Earle of <hi>Richmonds</hi> part above one hundred slaine the principall whereof was <hi>William Brandon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This battaile was fought at <hi>Rodner,</hi> neere <hi>Bosworth</hi> the two and twentieth day of, <hi>August</hi> in the yeare of our Lord God 1486.</p>
            <p>After publicke thanks giving was, as before prescribed, orderly and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously performed: Earle <hi>Henry</hi> gave order to search amongst the slaine, for such as were but wounded, commanding those carefully to be drest, and the other to be with decency on both sides buried.</p>
            <p>The body of King <hi>Richard</hi> being amongst the slaughtered carkases found; the whole armie gave a generall shoute, and with loud acclamations of long live King <hi>Henry,</hi> made the field ecchoe againe.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Stanly</hi> having in his custody King <hi>Richard</hi> the usurpers Crowne which amongst the spoyles his souldiers had found and brought to him, placed the same on Earle <hi>Henryes</hi> head, wherewith the souldiers reiterated their joyfull acclamations; making the fields resound with long live King <hi>Henry</hi> of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:7754:130"/>
that name the seventh, as if by their onely suffrages, he had bin elected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed King of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here with the tent-keepers of the usurper came and submitted themselves to the Lord <hi>Stanly,</hi> and brought with them young <hi>George Strange,</hi> whom the usurper upon the Lord <hi>Stanlyes</hi> refusall, presently to draw downe his forces to joyne with him, had sworne (before he went to dinner) by the life of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to have had beheaded. But was perswaded by his councell, to forbeare the execution, untill the battaile should be determined, now being brought to the presence of his father. The young Gentleman, (being thereto by his keepers instructed before) craved the help of his mediation to the king for their pardon, which was willingly undertaken, and as easily procured.</p>
            <p>From thence the camp presently removed, and King <hi>Henry</hi> marched to the Towne of <hi>Leicester,</hi> where for the more refreshing of his men, and the better accommodation of himselfe for his journey towards the City of <hi>London,</hi> he remained two dayes.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the body of the usurper starke naked, all mangled and besmeared with blood, and dust, without so much, as the lest ragge to cover his privities, was trussed behind <hi>Blanch Senigleer</hi> his owne Pursevant of armes like butchers ware, his heads and his armes hanging on the one side of the horse, his legs on the other, and so was brought to <hi>Leicester,</hi> where for a spectacle of hate and scorne, by the space of two dayes he lay bare and uninterred, At last by the Charitie of the Gray Fryers there, without solemne funerall pompe, scarce with ordinary solemnitie, he was inhumed in their Monastery there: he reigned two yeares, two moneths and one day.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Richard</hi> married, <hi>Anne</hi> second daughter of <hi>Richard Nevill</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stiled great Earle of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> by whom he had issue, <hi>Edward</hi> whom at twelue moneths old he created Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> but happily dyed before his father.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Richard</hi> was borne at <hi>Fodringhay</hi> Castle in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> the third sonne of <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> younger brother of <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> by him murdred in the Tower,</p>
            <p>After the death of his brother King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, he procured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be made Protector and guardian of his two Nephewes, of whom he made himselfe the execrable murtherer.</p>
            <p>For a fuller expression of his Character, he was borne a monster in nature, with all his teeth, with haire on his head, and nayles on his fingers and toes, with a viperous strength enforcing as it were his passage through his mothers wombe whom afterwards he shamed not, to accuse of adultery, but as one that then wrought journy-worke with the Divell, his manners and qualities se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded the feature and lineaments of his body and members, which were much deformed, being hooke shouldred, splay footed and goggle eyd, his countenance sower, the composure of his face little and round, his complexion swarfie, his left arme, from his birth drye and and withered.</p>
            <p>Nature supplied these deformities of the body, with a strong brayne, a quicke apprehension, a good memory and a most fluent tongue, which he seldome exercised but to the abuse of credulitie. And with the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his delivery, hee could so prevaile with such whom he ment to worke upon: that he would ofentimes, as it were infatuate them, and enforce their beliefe of his oathes and protestations, which were by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and wishing God to damne him, if hee did not performe his word (which at the time of the speaking was no part of his thought) sometimes against the hearers knowledge, and conscience, hee was neither
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:7754:130"/>
morally honest nor religiously good. He usd to make authority the stawking horse to his will, and his will the sole commander of his conscience, the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse whereof could without any scruple, swallow murther of brother, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes, wife, and neerest friends, nay attempt rape and incest with his owne brothers daughter, yet did with artificiall dissimulation so cover his dishonest and abhominable intentions, that not many could discover them.</p>
            <p>Who or whatsoever opposed his aspiring pride or profitable pleasure, was by his plotting cunningly and covertly taken away, or removed. Hee was so throughly perfect in the Hypocriticall art of simulation, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation, that hee would use most complement, and shew greatest signes of love and courtesie, to him in the morning, whose throat he had taken order to be cut that evening.</p>
            <p>He held it for a maxime in policy, that halfe doing in any thing, was worse then no doing; And therefore whatsoever he once attempted, hee went through with it, howsoever it seemed to others unnaturall, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian.</p>
            <p>He used the instruments of his bloudy plottes, as men doe their Candles, burne the first out to a snuffe, and then having lighted another, tread that under foote, yet howsoever his birth were proaigious and life monst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, yet his death was not dishonorable. For though his cause were bad, he fought bravely and dyed fighting, leaving behind an ample testimony of his great valour and little grace; with the end of his raigne by the sword, which he had used for the moving of civill dissention betwixt the two houses of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> which had beene so long drawne and so often bathed in the blood of Christians, was happily sheathed; And the passage to concord prepared, whilst this poore Island that had beene imbroyled with warre and her companions, had leasure to call to minde, the many mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, stratagemes, slaughters, overthrowes, and calamities, which through their unnaturall division of the two Roses, she had sustained, and thereby she found that from the time, that <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> who was slaine in the battaile at <hi>Wakefield</hi> seeking to anticipate the time allotted unto him by authoritie of the Parliament (whereby the Crowne was entayled to him and his issue,) to gaine the possession thereof and from whence all those, praerecited miseries did proceed, untill the death of the usurper there were slaine, fourescore Princes of the blood royall and twice as many natives of <hi>England,</hi> as were lost in the two conquests of <hi>France.</hi> The dissension that fell, was betwixt the house of <hi>Yorke</hi> descended from <hi>Lionel</hi> borne at <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe,</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> second sonne of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and the house of <hi>Lancaster</hi> issued from <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> the third surviving, but otherwise fourth sonne of the same King: the first giving for his cognizance the white Rose, the other the Red.</p>

            <p>This was the last battell that was fought in the dayes of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, but not all the bloodshed about this quarrell; For at <hi>London</hi> by the treason of Bastard <hi>Fauconbridge,</hi> there were seven hundred and eighty of his <note place="margin">Esquires 37. 1092.

            <p>Vpon <hi>Redmore</hi> Downe neere <hi>Bosworth</hi> in <hi>Leicestershire</hi> on the twentie two of August, was the twelfth set Battaile in this unkind quarrell fought, wherein King <hi>Richard</hi> the Vsurper was slaine, and with him on his part <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolke Walter</hi> Lord <hi>Ferrers,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Radcliffe,</hi> and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:7754:133"/>
Sir <hi>Robert Brackenbury</hi> with foure thousand and eight; And on <hi>Richmonds</hi> side, Sir <hi>William Brandon</hi> and 180. with him. After this Battell there was a conjunction of the so long severed Rose branches; Neverthelesse the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to <hi>Englands</hi> quiet, would not suffer the gate of concord to stand quite open, but raised up Impostors, and counterfeits to interrupt the same; But since the cause of the dissention by the Vnion of the Red and White in <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the seventh, and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> their so happy enter-marriage was taken away, what occasion of expence of blood did after fall out within the Realme, ought (under favour bee it delivered) rather to bee imputed to the effect of treasonable machinations, then to any just occasion of the <hi>Roses</hi> Title.</p>
            <p>And therefore I purposely omit to intermix the number of those that were slaine, since <hi>Bosworth</hi> field amongst those that are to bee reckoned up in the generall slaughter in the twelve Battells, and the occasions of expence of blood intervening by skirmishes and accidentall meanes, and content my selfe with the only recapitulation of the severall numbers, of Kings, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Dukes, Marquesses, Earles, Barons, Vicounts, Bishops, Mitred Prelates, Knights, <note n="*" place="margin">Knights el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Sonnes.</note> Esquires, <note n="*" place="margin">Of coat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armour and Ancestry.</note> Gentlemen, and private souldiers; That during the rage of these civill warres which followed, that breach of the due course of succession, attempted by the intrusion of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, fell under the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate fortunes of the Victors sword; untill that ever to bee blessed reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the two houses of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> whereby righteousnesse and Peace did kisse each other, and Mercy and Truth (which I pray God ever to continue) established the Crowne of <hi>England</hi> in an hopefull and happy descending Line; And as <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh conjoyned the Roses, so hath King <hi>James</hi> of ever-blessed memory united the predivided kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> espousing their Vnion to our Soveraine Lord King <hi>Charles,</hi> to Gods glory, the Churches good, and his Subjects great comfort.</p>
