         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IS loath to bid the world
goodnight, hee knowes
the grave is a long sleepe,
and therefore would sit up
as long as he could. His
soule has long dwelt in a
ruinous tenement, and yet
is so unwilling to leave it
that it could be content to
sue the body for reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
He lives now but to be
a burthen to his friends, as
age is to him, and yet his
thoughts are as farre from
death as he is nigh it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
time be a continued
motion, yet the Dyall of
his age stands still at 50.
<pb facs="tcp:1340:20"/>
that's his age for ten yeeres
afterward, and loues such a
friend that like a flattering
glasse tels him hee seemes
far younger. His memory
is full of the actions of his
youth, which he often hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storifies
to others in tedious
tales, and thinks they should
please others because him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
His discourses are
full of parenthesis, and his
wordes fall from him as
slowly as water from an
Alimbeck; drop by drop.
He loves the chimney cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and his chaire which he
brags was his grandfathers,
from whence he secures the
cubboard from the Catts
and Dogges, or the milke
<pb facs="tcp:1340:21"/>

is onely good to build up
the architecture of a seacole

hee marries a

               <p>IS the second part of the
little volume of man,
and differs from him onely
in her errataes, which can't
be mended, because shee
comes out worst still in the
last impression. Though
mens desires range after
variety, yet they finde no
change, since in one woman
all are epitomizd; for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is a skilfull painter and
seldome erres, shee that
drew one, drew all. The
cheefect object of their
creation is procreation, and
the continuation of the
<hi>Species</hi> of mankinde; for
<pb facs="tcp:1340:22"/>
when God first gave her to
man, he gave her with this
blessing, Increase and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply.
She was then call'd
a helper, and so shee is still;
for to many she helpes to
vndoe them. Shee's like
unto a running Lottery; a
man may draw forty blanks
before hee gets one prize.
Her apparell is but like a
sauce to a good dish, to
stirre and provoke the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
to take a taste of her
selfe: Or like an envious
curtayne, which our fancy
perswades us conceales ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
rarityes from us, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once withdrawne failes
much in the expectation:
Shee may be ty'rd before
<pb facs="tcp:1340:23"/>
satiated, and therefore is
one of <hi>Salomons</hi> three
things that cry, Give, give,
hell, woman, and the grave.
For her teares they must
be distinguisht, for they are
not onely the effects of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
sometimes of deceit,
sometimes anger, and can
bid them flow in a plentifull
manner when shee list.
Shee's full of mutability
and like Aprill weather,
can laugh and weepe at
once. Or shee's like a
stratagem of warre, which
admits of no second errors,
for to him that marryes a
woman; once to erre is
for ever to be undone. If
shee have beauty shee
<pb facs="tcp:1340:23"/>
growes proud oft at fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene,
begins to looke for
suters, and baites them with
laying forth her haire, smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
the superficies of her
face, and frequents pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
meetings that she may
the better publish her
beauty, which she knowes
is a flower will not long
last, and therefore desires it
may bee soone gathered.
Shee is naturally curious
and inquisitiue to know all
things, but carelesse to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
any. And hee that
commits a secret to her,
may as well put water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a sive or cullender, and
may looke to have both
kept alike. Lastly, shee is
<pb facs="tcp:1340:24"/>
but a costly vanity, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of wise men, the shell of
our generation, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitefull
than horseflesh;
an instument that may bee
easily plaid upon, for it

mind being busied in some
serious contemplation, the
common sense has no time

is not hasty in the desire of
