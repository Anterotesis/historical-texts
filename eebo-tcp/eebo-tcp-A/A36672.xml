            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Written by Mr.</hi> Dryden, <hi>to a New Play, call'd,</hi> The Loyal Brother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </byline>
            <l>POets, like Lawfull Monarchs, rul'd the Stage,</l>
            <l>Till Criticks, like Damn'd Whiggs, debauch'd our Age.</l>
            <l>Mark how they jump: Criticks wou'd regulate</l>
            <l>Our Theatres, and Whiggs reform our State:</l>
            <l>Both pretend love, and both (Plague rot 'em) hate.</l>
            <l>The Critick humbly ſeems Advice to bring,</l>
            <l>The fawning Whigg Petitions to the King:</l>
            <l>But ones advice into a Satyr ſlides;</l>
            <l>T'others Petition a Remonſtrance hides.</l>
            <l>Theſe will no Taxes give, and thoſe no Pence:</l>
            <l>Criticks wou'd ſtarve the Poet, Whiggs the Prince.</l>
            <l>The Critick all our troops of friends diſcards;</l>
            <l>Juſt ſo the Whigg wou'd fain pull down the Guards.</l>
            <l>Guards are illegal, that drive foes away,</l>
            <l>As watchfull Shepherds, that fright beaſts of prey.</l>
            <l>Kings, who Disband ſuch needleſs Aids as theſe,</l>
            <l>Are ſafe—as long as e're their Subjects pleaſe.</l>
            <l>And that wou'd be till next Queen <hi>Beſſes</hi> night:</l>
            <l>Which thus, grave penny Chroniclers endite.</l>
            <l>Sir <hi>Edmond-berry,</hi> firſt, in wofull wiſe,</l>
            <l>Leads up the ſhow, and Milks their Maudlin eyes.</l>
            <l>There's not a Butcher's Wife but Dribs her part,</l>
            <l>And pities the poor Pageant from her heart;</l>
            <l>Who, to provoke revenge, rides round the fire,</l>
            <l>And, with a civil congee, does retire.</l>
            <l>But guiltleſs blood to ground muſt never fall:</l>
            <l>There's <hi>Antichriſt</hi> behind, to pay for all.</l>
            <l>The Punk of <hi>Babylon</hi> in Pomp appears,</l>
            <l>A lewd Old Gentleman of Seventy years.</l>
            <l>Whoſe Age in vain our Mercy wou'd implore;</l>
            <l>For few take pity on an Old-caſt Whore.</l>
            <l>The Devil, who brought him to the ſhame, takes part;</l>
            <l>Sits cheek by jowl, in black, to cheer his heart:</l>
            <l>Like Theef and Parſon in a <hi>Tyburn-Cart.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The word is giv'n; and with a loud Huzzaw</l>
            <l>The Miter'd Moppet from his Chair they draw:</l>
            <l>On the ſlain Corps contending Nations fall;</l>
            <l>Alas, what's one poor Pope among 'em all!</l>
            <l>He burns; now all true hearts your Triumphs ring;</l>
            <l>And next (for faſhion) cry, <hi>God ſave the King.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>A needful Cry in midſt of ſuch Alarms:</l>
            <l>When Forty thouſand Men are up in Arms.</l>
            <l>But after he's once ſav'd, to make amends,</l>
            <l>In each ſucceeding Health they Damn his Friends:</l>
            <l>So God begins, but ſtill the Devil ends.</l>
            <l>What if ſome one inſpir'd with Zeal, ſhou'd call<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>Come let's go cry, God ſave him at <hi>White Hall?</hi>

His beſt friends wou'd not like this over-care:</l>
            <l>Or think him e're the ſafer for that pray'r.</l>
            <l>Five Praying Saints are by an Act allow'd:</l>

               <hi>Spoken by Mrs.</hi> Sarah Cook.</byline>
            <l>A Virgin Poet was ſerv'd up to day;</l>
            <l>Who till this hour, ne're cackled for a Play:</l>
            <l>He's neither yet a Whigg nor Tory-Boy;</l>
            <l>But, like a Girl, whom ſeveral wou'd enjoy,</l>
            <l>Begs leave to make the beſt of his own natural Toy.</l>
            <l>Were I to play my callow Author's game,</l>
            <l>The King's Houſe wou'd inſtruct me, by the Name:</l>
            <l>There's Loyalty to one: I wiſh no more:</l>
            <l>A Commonwealth ſounds like a Common Whore.</l>
            <l>Let Husband or Gallant be what they will,</l>
            <l>One part of Woman is true Tory ſtill.</l>
            <l>If any Factious ſpirit ſhou'd rebell,</l>
            <l>Our Sex, with eaſe, can every riſing quell.</l>
            <l>Then, as you hope we ſhou'd your failings hide,</l>
            <l>An honeſt Jury for our play provide:</l>
            <l>Whiggs, at their Poets never take offence;</l>
            <l>They ſave dull Culpritts who have Murther'd Senſe:</l>
            <l>Tho Nonſenſe is a nauſeous heavy Maſs,</l>
            <l>The Vehicle call'd Faction makes it paſs.</l>
            <l>Faction in Play's the Commonwealths man's bribe:</l>
            <l>The leaden farthing of the Canting Tribe:</l>
            <l>Though void in payment Laws and Statutes make it.</l>
            <l>The Neighbourhood, that knows the Man, will take it.</l>
            <l>'Tis Faction buys the Votes of half the Pit;</l>
            <l>Theirs is the Pention-Parliament of wit.</l>
            <l>In City-Clubs their venom let 'em vent;</l>
            <l>For there 'tis ſafe, in its own Element:</l>
            <l>Here, where their madneſs can have no pretence,</l>
            <l>Let 'em forget themſelves an hour in ſenſe.</l>
            <l>In one poor Iſle, why ſhou'd two Factions be?</l>
            <l>Small diffrence in your Vices I can ſee;</l>
            <l>In Drink and Drabs both ſides too well agree.</l>

            <l>If Places fell, the party cou'd not ſtand.</l>
            <l>Of this damn'd grievance ev'ry Whigg complains;</l>
            <l>They grunt like Hogs, till they have got their Grains.</l>
