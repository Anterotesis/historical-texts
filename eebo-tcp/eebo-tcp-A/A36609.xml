            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable The Earl of <hi>ROCHESTER,</hi> Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>'TIS enough for your Lordship to be consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to your self of having perform'd a just and honourable Action, in Redeeming this Play from the Persecution of my Enemies; but it wou'd be ingratitude in me, not to publish it to the World. That it has appear'd on the Stage is principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owing to you: That it has succeeded, is the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of your Judgment, by that of the Publick. 'Tis just the Inversion of an Act of Parliament: Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship first sign'd it, and then it was pass'd amongst the Lords and Commons. The Children of old Men are generally observ'd to be short liv'd, and of a weakly Constitution: How this may prove I know not; but hitherto it has promis'd well: And if it survive to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, it will carry the Noble Name of its Patron a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it; or, rather, it will be carried by yours to after Ages. <hi>Ariosto,</hi> in his <hi>Voyage of</hi> Astolpho <hi>to the Moon,</hi> has given us a fine Allegory of two Swans; who, when Time had thrown the Writings of many Poets into the River of Oblivion, were ever in a readiness to secure the best, and bear them aloft, into the Temple of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. Whether this Poem be of that Number, is left to the Judgment of the Swan who has preserv'd it: And though I can claim little from his Justice, I may presume to value my self upon his Charity. It will be told me, That I have mistaken the <hi>Italian</hi> Poet, who
<pb facs="tcp:48736:3"/>
means only that some excellent Writers, almost as few in Number as the Swans, have rescued the Memory of their Patrons, from Forgetfulness and Time; when a vast Multitude of Crows and Vultures, that is, bad Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers, Parasites, and Flatterers, oppress'd by the weight of the Names which they endeavour'd to redeem, were forc'd to let them fall again into <hi>Lethe,</hi> where they were lost for ever. If it be thus, my Lord, the Table wou'd be turn'd upon me: But I shou'd only fail in my vain Attempt: For either some other Immortal Swan, will be more capable of sustaining such a weight, or you who have so long been Conversant in the management of great Affairs, are able with your own Pen, to do Justice to your self; and, at the same time, to give the Nation a clearer and more faithful insight into those Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherein you have Worthily sustain'd so great a part. For to your Experience in State Affairs, you have also joyn'd no vulgar Erudition: Which all your Modesty is not able to conceal; for to understand critically the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies of <hi>Horace,</hi> is a height to which few of our Noble Men have arriv'd: And that this is your deserv'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, I am a living Evidence; as far, at least, as I can be allow'd a Competent Judge on that subject. Your Affection to that admirable Ode, which <hi>Horace</hi> writes to his <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> and which I had the Honour to inscribe to you, is not the only Proof of this Assertion. You may please to remember, that in the late happy Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I had with your Lordship at a Noble Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of yours, you took me aside, and pleas'd your Self with repeating to me, one of the most Beautiful Pieces in that Author. It was the Ode to <hi>Barine,</hi> wherein you were so particularly affected with that Elegant Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb facs="tcp:48736:3"/>
               <hi>Iuvenumque prodis publica cura.</hi> There is indeed the Vertue of a whole Poem, in those words; that <hi>curiosa fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitas,</hi> which <hi>Petronius</hi> so justly ascribes to our Author. The Barbarity of our Language is not able to reach it: Yet, when I have leisure, I mean to try, how near I can raise my <hi>English</hi> to his <hi>Latin</hi>: Though in the mean time, I cannot but imagine to my self, with what Scorn his Sacred <hi>Manes</hi> wou'd look on so lame a Translation as I cou'd make. His <hi>Recalcitrat undique tutus</hi> might more reasonably be apply'd to me, than he himself ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd it to <hi>Augustus Caesar.</hi> I ought to reckon that Day, as very Fortunate to me, and distinguish it, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients did, with a whiter Stone; because it furnish'd me with an Occasion of reading my <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to a Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Assembly of Ladies, where your Lordship's Three Fair Daughters, were pleas'd to Grace it with their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: And, if I may have leave to single out any one in particular, there was your admirable Daughter-in-law; shining, not like a Star, but a Constellation of her Self; a more true and brighter <hi>Berenice.</hi> Then it was, that whether out of your own Partiality, and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to my Writings, or out of Complaisance to the Fair Company, (who gave the first good Omen to my Success, by their Approbation,) your Lordship was pleas'd to add your own: And afterwards to Represent it to the Queen, as wholly Innocent of those Crimes, which were laid unjustly to its Charge. Neither am I to forget my Charming Patroness; though she will not allow my Publick Address to her, in a Dedication; but Protects me unseen, like my Guardian-Angel; and shuns my Gratitude, like a Fairy, who is Bountiful by stealth; and conceals the Giver, when she bestows the
<pb facs="tcp:48736:4"/>
Gift. But my Lady <hi>Sylvius</hi> has been juster to me, and pointed out the Goddess, at whose Altar I was to pay my Sacrifice and Thanks Offering. And had she been silent, yet my Lord Chamberlain himself, in restoring my Play, without any Alteration, avow'd to me, that I had the most Earnest Sollicitress, as well as the Fairest; and that nothing cou'd be refus'd to my Lady <hi>Hyde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Favours, my Lord, receiv'd from your Self, and your Noble Family, have encourag'd me to this Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; wherein I not only give you back a Play, which had you not redeem'd it, had not been mine; but also at the same time, Dedicate to you, the unworthy Author, with my inviolable Faith, and (how mean soever) my utmost Service: And I shall be proud to hold my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on you in Chief, as I do part of my small For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in <hi>Wiltshire.</hi> Your Goodness has not been wanting to me, during the Reign of my two Masters. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from a bare Treasury, my Success has been contrary to that of Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi>; and <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Fleece has then been moisten'd, when all the Ground has been dry about it. Such and so many Provocations of this nature, have concurr'd to my Invading of your Modesty, with this Address. I am sensible that it is in a manner forc'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. But your Lordship has been the Aggressor in this Quarrel, by so many Favours, which you are not weary of conferring on me. Though at the same time, I own the Ambition on my side, to be ever esteem'd</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>'TIs now seven or eight Years since I design'd to write this Play of <hi>CLEOMENES;</hi> and my Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> (whose Name I cannot mention without Honour, for the many Favours I have receiv'd from him) is pleas'd to witness for me, That in a <hi>French</hi> Book, which I presented him about that time, there were the Names of many Subjects that I had thought on for the Stage; amongst which, this <hi>Tragedy</hi> was one. This, was out of my Remembrance; but my Lord, on the occasion of stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping my Play, took the Opportunity of doing me a good Office at Court, by representing it as it was, a Piece long ago design'd: Which being judiciously treated, I thought was capable of moving Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on the Stage. The Success has justified my Opinion, and that at a time when the World is running mad after <hi>Farce,</hi> the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of bad Poetry, or rather the Iudgment that is fallen upon Dramatique Writing. Were I in the Humour, I have sufficient cause to expose it in its true Colours; but having for once escap'd, I will forbear my Satyr, and only be thankful for my Deliverance. A great part of my good Fortune, I must confess, is owing to the Iustice which was done me in the Performance: I can scarcely refrain from giving every one of the Actors their particular Commendations; but none of them will be offended, if I say what the Town has generally granted, That Mrs. <hi>Barry,</hi> always Excellent, has, in this <hi>Tragedy,</hi> excell'd Herself, and gain'd a Reputation beyond any Woman whom I have ever seen on the Theatre. After all, it was a bold Attempt of mine, to write upon a single Plott, unmix'd with <hi>Comedy;</hi> which though it be the natural and true way, yet is not to the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Nation. Yet to gratifie the barbarous Party of my Audience, I gave them a short Rabble-Scene, because the Mobb (as they call them) are represented by <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Polybius,</hi> with the same Character of Baseness and Cowardice, which are here describ'd, in the last Attempt of <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes.</hi> They may thank me, if they please, for this Indulgence; for no <hi>French</hi> Poet would have allow'd them any more than a bare
<pb facs="tcp:48736:5"/>
Relation of that Scene, which debases a <hi>Tragedy</hi> to show upon the Stage</p>
            <p>For the rest, some of the Mechanique Rules of Vnity are observed, and others are neglected. The Action is but one, which is the Death of <hi>Cleomenes;</hi> and every Scene in the Play, is tending to the Accomplishment of the Main Design. The Place is likewise one; for 'tis all in the compass of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the Port of that City. The time might easily have been reduc'd into the space of twenty four Hours, if I wou'd have omitted the Scence of Famine, in the Fifth Act; but it pleas'd me to try how <hi>Spartans</hi> cou'd endure it; and, besides, gave me the occasion of writing that other Scene, betwixt <hi>Cleomenes</hi> and his suspected Friend; and, in such a Case, 'tis better to trespass on a Rule, than leave out a Beauty.</p>
            <p>As for other Objections, I never heard any worth answering; and least of all that Foolish One, which is rais'd against me by the Sparks, for <hi>Cleomenes</hi> not accepting the Favours of <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandra.</hi> They wou'd not have re<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>us'd a fair Lady. I grant they wou'd not; but let them grant me, That they are not <hi>Hero's;</hi> and so much for the Point of Honour. A Man might have pleaded an Excuse for himself, if he had been false to an Old Wife, for the sake of a Young Mistress; but <hi>Cleora</hi> was in the Flower of her Age, and it was yet but Honey-moon with <hi>Cleomenes;</hi> and so much for Nature. Some have told me, That many of the fair Sex com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain for want of tender Scenes, and soft Expressions of Love: I will endeavour to make them some amends, if I write again; and my next <hi>Hero</hi> shall be no <hi>Spartan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know it will be here expected, that I should write somewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the forbidding of my Play; but the less I say of it, the better. And besides, I was so little concern'd at it, that had it not been on consideration of the Actors, who were to suffer on my account, I should not have been at all sollicitous, whether it were play'd, or no. No body can imagine, that in my declining Age I write willingly, or that I am desirous of exposing, at this time of day, the small Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which I have gotten on the <hi>Theatre.</hi> The Subsistence which I had from the former Government, is lost; and the Reward I have f<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om the Stage is so little, that it is not worth my Labour.</p>
            <p>As for the Reasons which were given for suspending the Play, it seems they were so ill founded, that my Lord Chamberlain no sooner took the pains to read it, but they vanish'd; and my Copy was restor'd to me, without the least Alteration by his Lordship.

it was acted; and I dare assure you, that here is no Parallel to be found: 'Tis neither Compliment, nor Satyr; but a plain Story, more strictly followed than any which has appear'd upon the Stage. 'Tis true, it had been garbled before by the Superiours of the Play-house; and I cannot reasonably blame them for their Caution; because they are answerable for any thing that is publickly represented: And their Zeal for the Government is such, that they had rather lose the best Poetry in the World, than give the least Suspicion of their Loyalty. The short is, that they were diligent enough to make sure Work: and to geld it so clearly in some places, that they took away the very Manhood of it. I can only apply to them, what <hi>Cassandra</hi> says somewhere in the Play to <hi>Ptolomey;</hi>

            <p>But, since it concerns me to be as circumspect as they are, I have given leave to my Bookseller to print the Life of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> as it is elegantly, and faithfully translated out of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> by my learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Friend, Mr. <hi>Creech;</hi> to whom the World has been indebted for his excellent Version of <hi>Lucretius;</hi> and I particularly oblig'd in his Translation of <hi>Horace.</hi> We daily expect <hi>Manilius</hi> from him; an Author worthy only of such Hands; which having formerly reveal'd the Secrets of Nature to us here on Earth, is now discovering to us her Palace in the Skies; and if I might be allow'd to say it, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Light to the Stars of Heaven.</p>

            <p>But to return to <hi>Plutarch;</hi> you will find him particularly fond of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> his Character; who as he was the last of the <hi>Spartan</hi> Heroes, so he was, in my Opinion, the greatest. Even his Enemy, <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius,</hi> though engag'd in the contrary Faction, yet speaks honourably of him; and especially of his last Action in <hi>Egypt.</hi> This Author is also made <hi>English,</hi> and will shortly be publish'd for the Common Benefit.</p>
            <p>What I have added to the Story, is chiefly the Love of <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoclea,</hi> the King's Mistress; whose Name I have chang'd into <hi>Cassandra;</hi> only for the better sound. As I have also the name of
<pb facs="tcp:48736:6"/>
               <hi>Nicagoras,</hi> into that of <hi>Coenus,</hi> for the same Reason. <hi>Cratisiclaea, Pantheus,</hi> and <hi>Sosybius,</hi> are to be found in the Story, with the same Characters which they have in the Tragedy. There is likewise mention made of the Son of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> who had resolution enough to throw himself headlong from a Tower, when he had heard of his Father's ill Success. And for <hi>Cleora,</hi> whom I make the second Wife of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> (for <hi>Aegyatis</hi> was dead before) you will find a hint of her in <hi>Plutarch;</hi> for he tells us, That after the loss of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle at <hi>Sellasia,</hi> he return'd to <hi>Sparta,</hi> and entring his own House, was there attended by a Free-born Woman of <hi>Megalopolis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Picture of <hi>Ptolomey Philopater,</hi> is given by the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Authors to the full. Both agree that he was an Original of his kind; a Lazy, Effeminate, Cowardly, Cruel, and Luxurious Prince, manag'd by his Favourite, and impos'd on by his Mistress. The Son of <hi>Sosybyus,</hi> whom I call <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> was a Friend to <hi>Cleomenes:</hi> but <hi>Plutarch</hi> says, he at length forsook him. I have giv'n him a fairer Character, and made it only a seeming Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which he practis'd. If any be so curious to enquire what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of <hi>Cassandra,</hi> whose Fortune was left in suspence at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of the Play, I must first inform them, that after the death of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> (the Heroe of my Poem,) I was oblig'd by the Laws of the <hi>Drama,</hi> to let fall the Curtain immediately; because the Action was then concluded. But <hi>Polybius</hi> tells us, that she surviv'd <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> who reign'd about Twenty seven Years; that with her Brother <hi>Agathocles,</hi> she govern'd <hi>Egypt</hi> in the Minority of his Son <hi>Ptolomey Epiphanes;</hi> and that finally for oppressing of the People, both the Brother and Sister were slain in a popular Insurrection.</p>
            <p>There is nothing remaining, but my Thanks to the Town in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and to the fair Ladies in particular, for their kind Reception of my Play. And though I cannot retract what I said before, that I was not much concern'd in my own particular, for the Embargo which was laid upon it: Yet I think my self oblig'd, at the same time, to render my Acknowledgments to those Honourable Persons, who were instrumental in the freeing it. For as it was from a Principle of Nobleness in them, that they would not suffer one to want, who was grown old in their Service: So it is from a Principle of another sort, that I have learn'd to possess my Soul in Patience, and not to be much disquieted, with any Disappointment of this Nature.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF CLEOMENES.</head>
            <p>THus fell <hi>Agis.</hi> His Brother <hi>Archidamus</hi> was too quick for <hi>Leonidas,</hi> and sav'd himself by a timely Retreat. But his Wife then newly brought to Bed, the Tyrant forc'd her from her own House, and compell'd her to marry his Son <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> though at that time too young for a Wife; for he was unwilling that any one else should have her, she being Heiress to her Father <hi>Gylippus</hi>'s great Estate; for Person, the finest Woman in all <hi>Greece,</hi> very good-natur'd, of an exemplary Life, and therefore, they say, she did all she could, that she might not be compell'd to this Match.</p>
            <p>Being thus married to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> she hated <hi>Leonidas,</hi> but to the Youth she show'd her self a kind and obliging Wife. He, as soon as they came together, began to love her very much, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Kindness that she still retain'd for the memory of <hi>Agis,</hi> wrought somewhat of Concern in the young Man for him, so that he would often enquire of her concerning what had pass'd, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively listen to the Story of <hi>Agis</hi>'s Designs. Now <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had a generous and great Soul; he was as temperate and moderate in his Pleasures as <hi>Agis,</hi> but not so very cautious, circumspect and gentle: a spur of Passion always gall'd him, and his eagerness to pursue that which he thought good and just, was violent and heady. To make Men willing to obey, he conceiv'd to be the best Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48736:8"/>
but likewise to break the stubborn, and force them to be better, was in his opinion commendable and brave. This Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made him dislike the management of the City: The Citizens lay dissolv'd in supine Idleness and Pleasures; the King minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, designing, if no body gave him any disturbance, to waste his Time in Ease and Riot; the Publick was neglected, and each Man intent upon his private Gain. 'Twas dangerous, now <hi>Agis</hi> was kill'd, to mention the exercising and training of their Youth, and to set up for the ancient Bravery and Equality, was Treason against the State. 'Tis said also that <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> whilst a Boy, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died Philosophy under <hi>Sphaerus</hi> the <hi>Borystenite,</hi> who coming to <hi>Sparta,</hi> was very diligent in Instructing the Youth: <hi>Sphaerus</hi> was one of the chief of <hi>Zeno</hi> the <hi>Citiean</hi>'s Scholars, and 'tis likely that he admir'd the manly Temper of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and inflam'd his generous Ambition. The ancient <hi>Leonidas</hi> (as Story saith) being ask'd, What manner of Poet he thought <hi>Tyrtaeus</hi>? reply'd, An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent one to whet the Courages of youth, for being fill'd with Fury by his Poems, they daringly ventur'd on any Danger: now the <hi>Stoicks</hi> Philosophy is a dangerous Incentive to hot and fiery Dispositions, but being mixt with a grave and cautious Temper, is very good to fix and settle the Resolutions.</p>
            <p>Upon the Death of his Father <hi>Leonidas,</hi> he succeeded, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the Citizens of all sorts to be debauch'd, the rich neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Publick, and intent on their own Gain and Pleasure, and the poor being crampt in their private Fortunes, grown unactive, Cowards, and not inclinable to the <hi>Spartan</hi> Institution and way of Breeding, that he had only the Name of King, and the <hi>Ephori</hi> all the Power, was resolv'd to change the present posture of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. He had a Friend whose name was <hi>Xenares,</hi> his Lover, (such an Affection the <hi>Spartans</hi> express by the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) him he sounded and of him he would commonly enquire, What manner of King <hi>Agis</hi> was, by what means, and by what Assistance he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and pursu'd his Designs. <hi>Xenares</hi> at first willingly comply'd with his Request, and told him the whole Story, with all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Circumstances of the Actions. But when he observ'd <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> to be extreamly affected at the Relation, and more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily mov'd at <hi>Agis</hi>'s new model of the Government, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48736:8"/>
a repetition of the Story, he at first severely chid him, told him, He was frantick, and at last left off all sort of Familiarity and Conversation with him, yet he never told any Man the cause of their Disagreement, but would only say, <hi>Cleomenes knew very well. Cleomenes</hi> finding <hi>Xenares</hi> averse to his Designs, and thinking all others to be of the same opinion, consulted with none, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd the whole Business by himself. And considering that it would be easier to bring about an Alteration when the City was at War, than when in Peace, he engag'd the Commonwealth in a Quarrel with the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> who had given them fair occasions to complain: for <hi>Aratus,</hi> a Man of the greatest Power amongst all the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> design'd from the very beginning to bring all the <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponnesians</hi> into one common Body. And to effect this, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took many Expeditions, and ran through a long course of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy; for he thought this the only means to make them an equal Match for their foreign Enemies: All the rest agreed to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals, only the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> the <hi>Eleans,</hi> and as many of the <hi>Arcadians</hi> as inclin'd to the <hi>Spartan</hi> Interest, refus'd. Therefore as soon as <hi>Leonidas</hi> was dead, he fell upon the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> and wasted those especially that border'd on <hi>Achaia</hi>; by this means designing to try the Inclinations of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> and despising <hi>Cleomenes</hi> as a Youth, and of no experience in Affairs of State or War. Upon this the <hi>Ephori</hi> sent <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to surprise the <hi>Athenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> (dedicated to <hi>Minerva</hi>) near <hi>Belbina,</hi> which is a pass of <hi>Laco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and was then under the Jurisdiction of the <hi>Megalopolitans: Cleomenes</hi> possest himself of the place, and fortified it; at which Action <hi>Aratus</hi> shew'd no publick Resentment, but marcht by night to surprise <hi>Tegea</hi> and <hi>Orchomenium.</hi> The Design fail'd; for those that were to betray the Cities into his Hands, doubted the Success; so <hi>Aratus</hi> retreated, imagining that his Design had been undiscovered: But <hi>Cleomenes</hi> wrote a jeering Letter to him, and desired to know, as from a Friend, whither he intended to march at night? And <hi>Aratus</hi> answering, That having understood his Design to fortifie <hi>Belbina,</hi> he resolv'd to march thither to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> return'd, That he believed it, but desir'd him to give him an account, if it stood with his Convenience, why he carryed those Torches and Ladders with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48736:9"/>
               <hi>Aratus</hi> laughing at the Jeer, and asking what manner of Youth this was; <hi>Democrites</hi> a <hi>Spartan</hi> Exile replyed, <hi>If you have any Designs upon the</hi> Lacedaemonians, <hi>begin before this young Eagle's Talons are grown.</hi> Presently after this, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> being in <hi>Arcadia</hi> with a few Horse, and 300 Foot, the <hi>Ephori</hi> fearing to engage in the War, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him home, but upon his Retreat, <hi>Aratus</hi> taking <hi>Caphuae,</hi> they commission'd him again. In this Expedition he took <hi>Methudrium,</hi> and spoiled the Country of the <hi>Argives,</hi> and the <hi>Achaians:</hi> to stop his Victory, and secure their Friends, sent 20000 foot and 1000 Horse against him, under the Command of <hi>Aristomachus. Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> fac'd them at <hi>Palantium,</hi> and offer'd Battle: But <hi>Aratus</hi> being dash'd at his Bravery, would not suffer the General to engage, but retreated, being curst by the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> and hooted at, and scorn'd by the <hi>Spartans,</hi> who were not above 5000, for a Coward. <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> encouraged by this Success, began to vaunt among the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens a Sentence of one of their ancient Kings, who said, <hi>The</hi> Spartans <hi>seldom enquired how many their Enemies were, but where they were.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, marching to the Assistance of the <hi>Eleans,</hi> upon whom the <hi>Achaians</hi> warr'd, and about <hi>Lycaeum</hi> falling upon the Enemy in their Retreat, he routed their whole Army, taking a great number of Captives, and leaving many dead upon the Place; so that it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reported amongst the Greeks that <hi>Aratus</hi> was slain. But <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> making the best Advantage of the Opportunity, presently after the Defear, march'd to <hi>Mantinaea,</hi> and before any body suspected it, took the City, and put a new Garrison into it. Upon this the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> being quite discouraged, and opposing <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Design of carrying on the War, he was eager to send for <hi>Archida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Agis</hi>'s Brother from <hi>Messena,</hi> for he of the other Family had a Right to the Kingdom; and beside, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> thought that the Power of the <hi>Ephori</hi> would be abated when the Kingly State was fill'd up, and equally poised between the two Families. But those that were concern'd in the Murder of <hi>Agis</hi> understanding the Design, and fearing that upon <hi>Archidamus</hi>'s Return they should be call'd to an Account, receiv'd him coming privately into Town, waited on him, and presently after murder'd him; but whether <hi>Cleomenes</hi> was against it (as <hi>Phylarchus</hi> imagines) or whether he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by his Friends, and wink'd at the Contrivance, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48736:9"/>
however, they were most blam'd, as having forc'd his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. But he still resolving to new-model the State, brib'd the <hi>Ephori</hi> to make him General: and won the Affections of many others by means of his Mother <hi>Cratesiclaea,</hi> who spared no Cost, and was very zealous to promote the same Interest; and though of her self she had no Inclination to marry, yet for her Son's sake she wedded one of the chiefest Citizens for Wealth and Power. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> marching forth with the Army now under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, took <hi>Leuctra,</hi> a place belonging to <hi>Megalopolis</hi>; and the <hi>Achaeans</hi> quickly facing him with a good body of Men command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Aratus</hi> in a Battle under the very Walls of the City, some part of his Army was routed. But <hi>Aratus</hi> commanding the <hi>Achae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> not to pass a deep Hollow, and stopping the Pursuit, <hi>Lydiadas</hi> the <hi>Megalopolitan</hi> fretting at the Orders, encouraging the Horse which he led, and pursuing the routed Enemy, fell into a place full of Vines, Hedges and Ditches; and being forc'd to break his Ranks, was put into a great Disorder. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> observing the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, commanded the <hi>Tarentines</hi> and <hi>Cretans</hi> to engage him, by whom, after a brave Dispute he was routed and slain. The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> thus encouraged with a great shout fell upon the <hi>Achaeans</hi> and routed their whole Army. Of the slain, which were very many, some <hi>Cleomenes</hi> delivered upon Articles, but the Body of <hi>Lydiadas</hi> he commanded to be brought to him; and then put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on it a purple Robe, and a Crown upon its Head, sent a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy with it to the Gates of <hi>Megalopolis.</hi> This <hi>Lydiadas</hi> was the Man that resign'd his Crown, restor'd Liberty to the Citizens, and joyn'd the City to the <hi>Achaean</hi> Interest. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> being very much raised by this Success; and perswaded, that if matters were wholly at his Disposal, he should quickly be too hard for the <hi>Achae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> He taught <hi>Megistones</hi> his Mother's Husband, That 'twas ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for the State to shake off the Power of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> and to put all their Wealth into one common Stock for the whole Body; That <hi>Sparta</hi> being restor'd to its old Equality, might be rais'd up to be Mistriss of all <hi>Greece. Megistones</hi> liked the Design, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged two or three more of his Friends. About that time one of the <hi>Ephori</hi> sleeping in <hi>Pasiphae</hi>'s Temple, dream'd a very surpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dream; for he thought he saw the four Chairs removed out

of the place where the <hi>Ephori</hi> used to sit and hear Causes, and one only set there; and whilst he wondred, he heard a Voice out of the Temple, saying, <hi>This is best for</hi> Sparta. The Person telling <hi>Cleomenes</hi> this Dream, he was a little troubled at first, fearing that he us'd this as a Trick to sift him, upon some Suspicion of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; but when he was satisfied that the Relater spoke truth, he took heart again; and taking with him those whom he thought would be against his model, he took <hi>Eraea</hi> and <hi>Alcaea,</hi> two Cities of the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> furnish'd <hi>Orchomenium</hi> with Provisions, besieg'd <hi>Mantinaea</hi>; and with long marches so harass'd the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> that many of them desir'd to be left in <hi>Arcadia</hi>; and he satisfy'd their Request. With the Mercenaries he march'd to <hi>Sparta,</hi> and by the way communicated his Design to those whom he thought fittest for his Purpose, and march'd slowly that he might catch the <hi>Ephori</hi> at Supper. When he was come near the City, he sent <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rycleidas</hi> to the <hi>Sussitium,</hi> the eating place of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> under pretence of carrying some Message from him from the Army; <hi>Threicion, Phaebis,</hi> and two of those which were bred with <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> which they call <hi>Samothracae,</hi> follow'd with a few Souldiers; And whilst <hi>Eurycleidas</hi> was delivering his Message to the <hi>Ephori,</hi> they ran upon them with their drawn Swords, and slew them. <hi>Agesilaus</hi> as soon as he was run through, fell, and lay as dead; but in a little time he rose, silently convey'd himself out of the Room, and crept undiscover'd into a little House, which was the Temple of <hi>Fear,</hi> and which always us'd to be shut, but was then by chance open; being got in, he shut the Door, and lay close: the other four were kill'd, and above ten more that came to their Assistance; to those that were quiet, they did no harm, stopt none that fled the City, and spar'd <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> who came out of the Temple the next day. The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> have not only Temples dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Fear,</hi> but also to <hi>Death, Laughter,</hi> and the like Passions: now they worship <hi>Fear,</hi> not as they do those Deities which they dread, esteeming it hurtfull, but thinking their Polity is chiefly kept up by Law; and therefore the <hi>Ephori</hi> (<hi>Aristotle</hi> is my Author) when they enter upon their Government, make Proclamation to the People, that they should shave their Whiskers, and be obedient to the Laws, that they might not be forc'd to be severe, using this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48736:10"/>
trivial Particular (in my opinion) to accustom their Youth to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience even in the smallest Matters. And the Ancients, I think, did not imagine Fortitude to be plain fearlessness, but a cautious Fear of Infamy and Disgrace: for those that show most Fear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Laws, are most bold against their Enemies; and those are least afraid of any Danger, who are most afraid of a just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. Therefore he said well:
<q>
                  <l>A Reverence still attends on Fear.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Homer,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Fear'd you shall be, dear Vncle, and rever'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And again,
<q>
                  <l>In silence fearing those that bore the sway.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>For 'tis very commonly seen, that Men reverence those whom they fear; and therefore the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> plac'd the Temple of <hi>Fear</hi> by the <hi>Sussitium</hi> of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> having rais'd their Power to almost absolute Monarchy.</p>
            <p>The next day <hi>Cleomenes</hi> proscrib'd 80 of the Citizens, whom he thought necessary to banish, and removed all the Seats of the <hi>Ephori</hi> except one, in which he himself design'd to sit, and hear Causes; and calling the Citizens together, he made an Apology for his Proceedings, saying, That by <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the Senate was joyn'd to the Kings, and that that model of Government had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a long time, and needed no other sort of Magistrates to give it perfection. But afterward in the long War with the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senians,</hi> when the Kings being to command the Army, had no time to attend civil Causes, they chose some of their Friends, and left them to determine the Suits of the Citizens in their stead. These were call'd <hi>Ephori,</hi> and at first behav'd themselves as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to the Kings, but afterward by degrees they appropriated the Power to themselves, and erected a distinct sort of Magistracy. An evidence of the Truth of this may be taken from the usual Behaviour of the Kings, who upon the first and second Message of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> refuse to go, but upon the third readily attend them:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48736:11"/>
And <hi>Asteropus,</hi> the first that rais'd the <hi>Ephori</hi> to that height of Power, liv'd a great many years after their Institution; therefore whil'st they modestly contain'd themselves within their own proper Sphear, 'twas better to bear with them than to make a distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance. But that an upstart introduc'd Power should so far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the old model of Government, as to banish some Kings, murder others without hearing their defence, and threaten those who desir'd to see the best and most divine Constitution restor'd in <hi>Sparta,</hi> was unsufferable. Therefore if it had been possible for him without Bloodshed, to have freed <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> from those foreign Plagues, Luxury, Vanity, Debts and Usury, and from those more ancient Evils, Poverty and Riches, he should have thought himself the happiest King in the World, having like an expert Physician cur'd the Diseases of his Countrey without pain. But now in this necessity <hi>Lycurgus</hi>'s Example favour'd his Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, who being neither King, nor Magistrate, but a private Man, and aiming at the Kingdom, came arm'd into the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, and for fear of the King <hi>Carileus</hi> fled to the Altar: but he being a good Man, and a lover of his Countrey, readily consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Lycurgus</hi>'s Project, and admitted an Alteration in the State. Thus by his own Actions <hi>Lycurgus</hi> show'd, That it was difficult to correct the Government without Force and Fear, in using which, he said, he would be so moderate, as never to desire their Assistance, but either to terrifie or ruine the Enemies of <hi>Sparta</hi>'s Happiness and Safety. He commanded that all the Land should be left in common, and private Claims laid aside: That Debtors should be discharged of their Debts, and a strict search made, who were Foreigners, and who not: That the true <hi>Spartans,</hi> recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Courage, might defend the City by their Arms, and that we may no longer see <hi>Laconia,</hi> for want of a sufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to secure it, wasted by the <hi>Aetolians</hi> and <hi>Illyrians.</hi> Then he himself first, with his Father-in-law <hi>Megistones,</hi> and his Friends, brought all their Wealth into one publick Stock, and all the other Citizens follow'd the example: the Land was divided, and every one that he had banish'd, had a share assign'd him; for he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to restore all, as soon as things were settled and in quiet; and compleating the common number of Citizens, out of the best
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48736:11"/>
and most agreeable of the neighbouring Inhabitants, he rais'd a Body of 4000 Men, and instead of a Spear, taught them to use a <hi>Sarissa,</hi> (a long Pike) with both hands, and to carry their Shields by a String fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned round their Arms, and not by a Handle, as before. After this he began to consult about the exercising and breeding of the Youth, (many Particulars of which, <hi>Sphaerus</hi> being then at <hi>Sparta,</hi> directed) and in a short time the Schools of Exercise, and their <hi>Sussitia,</hi> (common eating Places) recover'd their ancient Decency and Order, a few out of necessity, but the most voluntarily applying themselves to that generous and <hi>Laconick</hi> way of Living: besides, that the Name of Monarch might give them no jealousie, he made <hi>Eucleidas,</hi> his Brother, Partner in the Throne; and that was the only time that <hi>Sparta</hi> had two Kings of the same Family. Then understanding that the <hi>Achaeans</hi> and <hi>Aratus</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd that this Change had disturb'd and shaken his Affairs, and that he would not venture out of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and leave the City now unsettled by so great an Alteration, he thought it great and serviceable to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, to convince his Enemies that he was eagerly desirous of a War: And therefore making an Incursion into the Territories of <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> he wasted the Countrey very much, and got a considerable Booty. And at last taking those that us'd to act in the publick Solemnities travell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Messena,</hi> and building a Theater in the Enemies Countrey, and setting a Prize of 40<hi>l.</hi> value, he sate Spectator a whole day; not that he either desir'd or needed such a Divertisement, but as it were insulting o're his Enemies, and that by thus manifestly despising them, he might show that he had more than conquer'd the <hi>Achaeans</hi>: For that alone of all the Greek or Kings Armies had no Stage-players, no Juglers, no dancing or singing Women attending it, but was free from all sorts of Loosness, Wantonness and Foppery; the young Men being for the most part upon Duty, and the old Men teaching them at leisure time to apply themselves to their usual Drollery, and to rally one another facetiously after the <hi>Laconick</hi> fashion; the Advantages of which I have discover'd in the Life of <hi>Lycurgus.</hi> He himself instructed all by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: he was a living Pattern of Temperance before every bodies eyes, and his course of Living was neither more stately nor more expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive than any of the Commons. And this was a considerable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to him in his Designs on <hi>Greece</hi>; for Men when they waited upon other Kings, did not so much admire their Wealth, costly Furniture, and numerous Attendance, as they hated their Pride and State, their diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Access, and scornful commanding Answers to their Petitions.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48736:12"/>
But when they came to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> who was both really a King, and bore that Title, and saw no Purple, no Robes of State upon him, no Chairs and Couches about him for his ease, and that he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Petitions, and return Answers after a long delay, by a number of Messengers, Waiters, or by Bills, but that he rose and came forward to meet those that came to wait upon him, staid, talk'd freely and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously with all that had Business, they were extreamly taken, won to his Service, and profess'd that he alone was the true Son of <hi>Hercules.</hi> His common every days Meal was in a mean Room, very sparing, and after the <hi>Laconick</hi> manner; and when he entertain'd Ambassadors or Strangers, two more Beds were added, and a little better Dinner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by his Servants; but no Fricacies, no Dainties, only the Dishes were larger, and the Wine more plentiful; for he reprov'd one of his Friends for entertaining some Strangers, with nothing but Pulse and black Broth, such Diet as they usually had in their <hi>Phiditia,</hi> saying, That upon such occasions, and when they treat Strangers, 'twas not requisite to be too exact <hi>Laconians.</hi> After Supper, a Stand was brought in with a brass Vessel full of Wine, two silver Pots, which held almost a Quart apiece, a few silver Cups, of which he that pleas'd might drink, but no Liquor was forc'd on any of the Guests. There was no Musick, nor was any requir'd; for he entertain'd the Company, sometimes asking Questions, sometimes telling Stories: And his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course was neither too grave, and unpleasantly serious, nor vain and abusive, but merrily facetious; for he thought those ways of catching Men by Gifts and Presents, which other Kings use, to be mean and inartificial; and it seem'd to him to be the most glorious method, and most suitable to a King, to win the Affections of those that came near him, by pleasant Discourse, and unaffected Conversation: for a Friend and Mercenary differ only in this, that the one is made by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation and Agreeableness of Humour, and the other by Reward. The <hi>Mantineans</hi> were the first that oblig'd him; for getting by night in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City, and driving out the <hi>Achaean</hi> Garrison, they put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under his Protection: he restor'd them their Polity and Laws, and the same day march'd to <hi>Tegea</hi>; and a little while after fetching a Compass through <hi>Arcadia,</hi> he made a descent upon <hi>Pherae</hi> in <hi>Achaia,</hi> intending to force <hi>Aratus</hi> to a Battel, or bring him into Disrepute, for refusing to engage, and suffering him to wast the Countrey: <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batus</hi> at that time commanded the Army, but <hi>Aratus</hi> had all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er amongst the <hi>Achaeans.</hi> The <hi>Achaeans</hi> marching forth with their

whole Strength, and incamping in <hi>Dumaeae,</hi> about <hi>Hecatombaeum, Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> came up, and thinking it not advisable to pitch between <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeae,</hi> a City of the Enemies, and the Camp of the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> he bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dar'd the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> and forc'd them to a Battel, and routing the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx,</hi> slew a great many in the Fight, and took many Prisoners; thence marching to <hi>Lagon,</hi> and driving out the <hi>Achaean</hi> Garrison, he restor'd the City to the <hi>Elaeans.</hi> The Affairs of the <hi>Achaeans</hi> being in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate condition, <hi>Aratus,</hi> who was wont to continue in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above a year, refus'd the Command, though they entreated and urg'd him to accept it; and this was ill done, when the Storm was high, to put the Power out of his own hands, and set another to the Helm. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> at first propos'd fair and easie Conditions by his Ambassadors to the <hi>Achaeans</hi>; but afterward he sent others, and requir'd the chief Command to be settled upon him; and in other Matters he promis'd to agree to reasonable Terms, and to restore their Captives and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. The <hi>Achaeans</hi> were willing to come to an agreement upon those terms, and invited <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to <hi>Lerna,</hi> where an Assembly was to be held; but it hapned that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> hastily marching on, and unreasonably drinking Water, brought up abundance of Blood, and lost his Voice: therefore being unable to continue his March, he sent the chiefest of the Captives to the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> and putting off the Meeting for some time retir'd to <hi>Lacedaemon.</hi> This ruin'd the Affairs of <hi>Greece,</hi> which was just then ready to recover it self out of its Disasters, and avoid the insult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Covetousness of the <hi>Macedonians</hi>: for <hi>Aratus,</hi> whether fearing or distrusting <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> or envying his unlook'd-for Success, or think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a disgrace for him who had commanded 33 years, to have a young Man succeed to all his Glory and his Power, and be Head of that Government which he had been raising and setling so many years; he first endeavour'd to keep the <hi>Achaeans</hi> from closing with <hi>Cleomenes</hi>; but when they would not hearken to him, fearing <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s daring Spirit, and thinking the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi>'s Proposals to be very reasonable who design'd only to reduce <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> to its old Model, he took his last Refuge, in an Action which was unbecoming any of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> most dishonourable to him, and most unworthy his former Bravery and Exploits: for he call'd <hi>Antigonus</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> and fill'd <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> with <hi>Macedonians,</hi> whom he himself, when a Youth, having beaten their Garrison out of the Castle of <hi>Corinth,</hi> had driven from the same Countrey; beside he declar'd himself an Enemy to all Kings, and hath left many dishonourable Stories of this same <hi>Antigonus,</hi> in those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48736:13"/>
which he wrote. And though he declares that he suffer'd considerable Losses, and underwent great dangers, that he might free <hi>Athens</hi> from the Power of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> yet afterward he brought the very same Men arm'd into his own Countrey, and his own House, even to the Womens Apartment. He would not endure, that one of the Family of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and one that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the Polity of his Countrey, as it were a disorder'd Harmony, and tun'd it to the plain <hi>Dorick</hi> measure of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> to be styl'd, Head of the <hi>Triccaeans</hi> and <hi>Sicyonians</hi>; and whilst he fled the Pulse and short Coat, and, which were his chief Accusations against <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of Wealth, and reformation of Poverty, he basely subjected himself, together with <hi>Achaea,</hi> to the Diadem and Purple, to the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Commands of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and their <hi>Satrapae.</hi> That he might not seem to be under <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> he sacrific'd the <hi>Antigonea,</hi> (Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices in Honour of <hi>Antigonus</hi>) and sung <hi>Paeans</hi> himself with a Garland on his Head, to the Honour of a rotten, consumptive <hi>Macedonian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I write this not out of any design to disgrace <hi>Aratus</hi> (for in many things he shew'd himself vigorous for the <hi>Graecian</hi> Interest, and a great Man) but out of pity to the weakness of Humane Nature, which, in such a Person so excellent, and so many ways disposed to Vertue, cannot attain to a State irreprehensible. The <hi>Achaeans</hi> meeting again at <hi>Argos,</hi> and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> descending from <hi>Tegea,</hi> there were great hopes that all Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences would be compos'd. But <hi>Aratus, Antigonus,</hi> and He having already agreed upon the chief Articles of their League, fearing that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> would carry all before him, and either win, or force the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to comply with his Demands, propos'd, that, having three hundred Hostages put into his Hands, he should come alone into the Town, or bring his Army to the place of Exercise, call'd <hi>Cillarabion,</hi> without the City, and treat there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> hearing this, said, That he was unjustly dealt with; for they ought to have told him so plainly at first, and not now he was come even to their Doors, show their Jealousie, and deny him Admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and writing an Epistle to the <hi>Achaeans</hi> about the same Subject; the greatest part of which was an Accusation of <hi>Aratus</hi>; and <hi>Aratus,</hi> on the other side, ripping up his Faults to the Assembly, he hastily dislodg'd; and sent a Trumpeter to denounce War against the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> but not to <hi>Argos,</hi> but to <hi>Aegium,</hi> as <hi>Aratus</hi> delivers, that he might not give them notice enough to make Provision for their Defence. Upon this, the <hi>Achaeans</hi> were mightily disturb'd, the common People expecting a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48736:13"/>
of the Land, and a Release from their Debts; and the chief Men being on many Accounts displeas'd with <hi>Aratus,</hi> and some Angry and at odds with him, as the occasion of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> descent on <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponnesus.</hi> Encouraged by these Misunderstandings, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> invades <hi>Achaea</hi>; and first took <hi>Pellene</hi> by surprise, and beat out the <hi>Achaean</hi> Garrison; and afterward brought over <hi>Pheneon</hi> and <hi>Pentelaeon</hi> to his side. Now the <hi>Achaeans</hi> suspecting some treacherous Designs at <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Sicyon,</hi> sent their Horse and Mercenaries out of <hi>Argos</hi> to have an Eye upon those Cities, and they themselves went to <hi>Argos</hi> to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the <hi>Nemean</hi> Games. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> advertis'd of this march, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping (as it afterward fell out) that upon an unexpected Advance to the City now busied in the Solemnity of the Games, and throng'd with numerous Spectators he should raise a considerable Terror and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion amongst them; by night he march'd with his Army to the Walls, and taking the quarter of the Town call'd <hi>Aspis,</hi> which lies above the Theater, a place well fortify'd, and hard to be approach'd, he so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd them, that none offer'd to resist, but agreed to accept a Garrison, to give twenty Citizens for Hostages, and to assist the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> and that he should have the chief Command. This Action consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably encreas'd his Reputation, and his Power; for the ancient <hi>Spartan</hi> Kings, though they many ways endeavour'd to effect it, could never bring <hi>Argos</hi> to be stedfastly and sincerely theirs. And <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> a most experienc'd Captain, and brave Souldier, though be entred the City by force, could not keep Possession, but was slain himself with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable part of his Army: Therefore they admir'd the Dispatch and Contrivance of <hi>Cleomenes</hi>; and those that before derided him for say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he imitated <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> in releasing the People from their debts, and in equally dividing the Wealth of the Citizens, were now perswaded that he was the cause of the desirable Alterations in the <hi>Spartan</hi> Common-wealth: For before they were very low in the World, and so unable to secure their own that the <hi>Aetolians</hi> invading <hi>Laconia,</hi> brought away fifty thousand Slaves; (so that one of the elder <hi>Spartans</hi> is reported to have said, That <hi>They had done</hi> Laconia <hi>a kindness by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdening it</hi>) and yet a little while after applying themselves to their own Customs, and ancient Institution, they gave notable Instances of Courage as Obedience, and if they had been under the Eye of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> himself; and quickly rais'd <hi>Sparta</hi> to be Head of all <hi>Greece,</hi> and recover'd <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> to themselves. Whilst <hi>Argos</hi> was taken, and <hi>Cleonae</hi> and <hi>Philius</hi> sided with <hi>Cleomenes, Aratus</hi> was at <hi>Corinth</hi> search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48736:14"/>
after some, who were reported to favour the <hi>Spartan</hi> Interest. The News being brought to him, disturb'd him very much; for he perceiv'd the City inclining to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and the <hi>Achaeans</hi> willing to be at ease; therefore he call'd all the Citizens into the common Hall, and, as it were undesignedly retreating to the Gate, he mounted his Horse that stood ready there, and fled to <hi>Sicyon</hi>; and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> made such hast to <hi>Cleomenes</hi> at <hi>Argos,</hi> that (as <hi>Aratus</hi> says) striving who should be first there, they spoil'd all their Horses: and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> was very angry with the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for letting <hi>Aratus</hi> escape: And <hi>Megistones</hi> came from <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to him, desiring him to deliver up the Castle of <hi>Corinth,</hi> which was then garrison'd by the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd him a considerable Sum of Money; and that he answered, That <hi>Matters were not now in his Power, but he in theirs.</hi> Thus <hi>Aratus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self writes. But <hi>Cleomenes</hi> marching from <hi>Argos,</hi> and taking in the <hi>Traezenians, Epidaurians,</hi> and <hi>Hermioneans,</hi> came to <hi>Corinth,</hi> and block'd up the Castle which the <hi>Achaeans</hi> would not surrender; and sending for <hi>Aratus</hi>'s Friends and Stewards, committed his House and Estate to their Care and Management; and sent <hi>Tritimallus</hi> the <hi>Messenian</hi> to him a second time, desiring that the Castle might be equally garrison'd by the <hi>Spartans</hi> and <hi>Achaeans,</hi> and promising to <hi>Aratus</hi> himself double the Pension that he receiv'd from King <hi>Ptolomy:</hi> But <hi>Aratus</hi> refusing the Conditions, and sending his own Son with other Hostages to <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and perswading the <hi>Achaeans</hi> to make a Decree for delivering the Castle into <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s Hands, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> invaded the Territority of the <hi>Sicyonians,</hi> and by a Decree of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> seiz'd on all <hi>Aratus</hi>'s Estate. In the mean time <hi>Antigonus,</hi> with a great Army, pass'd <hi>Gera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> thinking it more adviseable to fortifie and garrison, not the <hi>Isthmus,</hi> but the Mountains called <hi>Onia,</hi> and by a long Siege and Skirmishes to weary the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> than to venture a set Battle, put his Design in Execution, which very much distress'd <hi>Antigonus</hi>; for he had not brought Victuals sufficient for his Army; nor was it easie to force a way through whilst <hi>Cleomenes</hi> guarded the Pass. He attempted by night to pass through <hi>Lechaeum,</hi> but fail'd, and lost some Men; so that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> and his Army were mightily encouraged, and so flusht with the Victory, and they went merrily to Supper; and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> was very much dejected, being reduc'd to those miserable straits. At last he design'd to march to the Promontory <hi>Heraeum,</hi> and thence transport his Army in Boats to <hi>Sicyon,</hi> which would take up a great deal of time, and be very chargeable. The same time about E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening

some of <hi>Aratus</hi>'s Friends came from <hi>Argos</hi> by Sea, and invited him to return, for the <hi>Argives</hi> would revolt from <hi>Cleomenes. Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> was the Man that wrought the Revolt, and he had no hard task to perswade the common People; for they were all angry with <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> for not releasing them from their Debts as they expected. Upon this Advertisement <hi>Aratus</hi> with fifteen hundred of <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s Souldiers fail'd to <hi>Epidaurus</hi>; but <hi>Aristotle</hi> not staying for his coming, drew out the Citizens, and fought against the Garrison of the Castle, and <hi>Timoxenus</hi> with the <hi>Achaeans</hi> from <hi>Sicyon,</hi> came to his Assistance. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omenes</hi> heard the News about the second Watch of the Night, and sending for <hi>Megistones</hi> angrily commanded him to go and set things right at <hi>Argos.</hi> This <hi>Megistones</hi> was the Man who pass'd his word for the <hi>Argives</hi> Loyalty, and perswaded him not to banish the suspected. This <hi>Megistones</hi> he dispatch'd with two thousand Souldiers, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd <hi>Antigonus</hi> himself, and encouraged the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> pretending that there was no great matter in the Stirs at <hi>Argos,</hi> but only a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Disturbance rais'd by a few inconsiderable Persons. But when <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistones,</hi> entring <hi>Argos,</hi> was slain, and the Garrison could scarce hold out, and frequent Messengers came to <hi>Cleomenes</hi> for Succours, he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing least the Enemy having taken <hi>Argos,</hi> should shut up the Passes, and securely waste <hi>Laconia,</hi> and besiege <hi>Sparta</hi> it self, which he had left without Forces; he dislodg'd from <hi>Corinth,</hi> and presently lost that City; for <hi>Antigonus</hi> entred it, and garrison'd the Town. He turn'd aside from his direct March, and assaulting the Wall of <hi>Argos,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to break in; and having clear'd a way under the quarter called <hi>Aspis,</hi> he joyn'd the Garrison which still held out against the <hi>Achaeans</hi>; some parts of the City he scal'd, and took, and his <hi>Cretan</hi> Archers clear'd the Streets. But when he saw <hi>Antigonus</hi> with his <hi>Phalanx</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending from the Mountains into the Plain, and the Horse on all sides entring the City, he thought it impossible to maintain his Post, and therefore with all his Men made a safe Retreat behind the Wall. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in a short time rais'd himself to a considerable height, and in one March made himself Master of almost all <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> and lost all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in as short a time: For some of his Allies presently forsook him, and others not long after put themselves under <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s Protection. His Army thus defeated, as he was leading back the Relicks of his Forces, some from <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> met him in the Evening at <hi>Tegea,</hi> and brought him News of as great a Misfortune as that which he had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suffer'd, and that was the Death of his Wife, whom he doted on
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48736:15"/>
so much, that when he was most prosperous, he would ever now and then make a step to <hi>Sparta,</hi> to visit his beloved <hi>Aegiatis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This News afflicted him extreamly, and he griev'd, as a young Man would do for the loss of a very beautiful and excellent Wife; yet his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion did not debase the greatness of his Mind, but keeping his usual Voice, his Countenance, and his Habit, he gave necessary Orders to his Captains, and took care to secure the <hi>Tegeans.</hi> The next day he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd to <hi>Sparta,</hi> and having at home with his Mother and Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail'd the loss, and finish'd his Mourning, he presently appear'd about the publick Affairs of the State. Now <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> the King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> promis'd him Assistance, but demanded his Mother and Children for Hostages: this for some considerable time he was asham'd to discover to his Mother; and though he often went to her on purpose, and was just upon the Discourse, yet still refrain'd, and kept it to himself: so that she began to suspect somewhat, and ask'd his Friends, Whether <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> had somewhat to say to her, which he was afraid to speak? At last <hi>Cleomenes</hi> venturing to tell her, she laugh'd heartily, and said, <hi>Was this the thing that you had often a mind to tell me, and was afraid? Why do not you put me on Shipboard, and send this Carkase where it may be most serviceable to</hi> Sparta, <hi>before Age wastes it unprofitably here?</hi> Therefore all things being provided for the Voyage, they went to <hi>Taenarus</hi> on Foot, and the Army waited on them. <hi>Cratesiclaea,</hi> when she was ready to go on Board, took <hi>Cleomenes</hi> aside into <hi>Neptune</hi>'s Temple, and embracing him who was very much dejected, and extreamly discompos'd, she said thus, <hi>Go to King of</hi> Sparta; <hi>when we are without door, let none see us Weep, or show any Passion below the Honour and Dignity of</hi> Sparta; <hi>for that alone is in our own Power: as for Success or Disappointments, those wait on us as the Deity decrees.</hi> Having said thus, and compos'd her Countenance, she went to the Ship with her little Grandson, and bad the Pilot put presently out to Sea. When she came to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and understood that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> entertain'd Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals and Overtures of Peace from <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and that <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> tho the <hi>Achaeans</hi> invited and urg'd him to an Agreement, was afraid, for her sake, to come to any, without <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s consent, she wrote to him, advising him to do that which was most becoming and most profitable for <hi>Sparta,</hi> and not for the sake of an old Woman and a little Child, always stand in fear of <hi>Ptolomy:</hi> this Character she maintain'd in her Misfortunes. <hi>Antigonus</hi> having taken <hi>Tegea,</hi> and plunder'd <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomenum</hi> and <hi>Mantinaea, Cleomenes</hi> was shut up within the narrow Bounds of <hi>Laconia,</hi> and made such of the <hi>Heilots</hi> as could pay five <hi>Attick</hi> pounds,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48736:15"/>
free of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and by that means got together 500 Talents; and arming 2000 after the <hi>Macedonian</hi> fashion, that he might make a Body fit to oppose <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s <hi>Lucaspidae</hi> (white Shields) he undertook a very considerable and very surprizing Enterprize. <hi>Megalopolis</hi> was at that time a City of itself, as big and as pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful as <hi>Sparta,</hi> and had the Forces of the <hi>Achaeans</hi> and <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> encamping on its sides; and it was chiefly the <hi>Megalopolitans</hi> doing, that <hi>Antigonus</hi> was call'd in to assist the <hi>Achaeans. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omenes</hi> having a design upon this City, (no Action was ever more sudden and more unexpected) order'd his Men to take five days Provision, and so march'd to <hi>Sellasia,</hi> as if he intended to spoil the Country of the <hi>Argives</hi>; but from thence making a descent into the Territories of <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> and refreshing his Army about <hi>Rhaetium,</hi> he march'd through <hi>Helicon,</hi> directly to the City. When he was not far off the Town, he sent <hi>Panteus</hi> with two Regiments to surprize the <hi>Mesopyrgion,</hi> (the Quarter between the two Towers) which he understood to be the most unguarded Quarter of the <hi>Megalopolitans</hi> Fortifications; and with the rest of his Forces he follow'd leisurely <hi>Panteus,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly surpriz'd that place, but finding a great part of the Wall without Guards, he pull'd down some Places, and demolish'd others, and kill'd all the Defenders that he found. Whilst he was thus busied, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> came up to him, and was got with his Army within the City, before the <hi>Megalopolitans</hi> knew of the surprize: At last, as soon as it was discover'd, some left the Town immediately, taking with them what Money they had ready; some arm'd, and engag'd the Enemy; and tho' they were not able to beat them out, yet they gave their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens time and opportunity safely to retire: so that there were not above 1000 Persons left in the Town, all the rest flying with their Wives and Children, and escaping to <hi>Messena.</hi> A great number of those that arm'd and fought the Enemy, were sav'd, and very few taken, amongst whom were <hi>Lysandridas</hi> and <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridas,</hi> two Men of great Power and Reputation amongst the <hi>Magalopolitans</hi>; and therefore the Soldiers, as soon as they were taken, brought them to <hi>Cleomenes</hi>: And <hi>Lysandridas,</hi> as soon as he saw <hi>Cleomenes</hi> afar off, cry'd out: <hi>Now King of</hi> Sparta, <hi>'tis in your power by doing a most Kingly and braver Action than you have alredy perform'd, to purchase a considerable Glory.</hi> And <hi>Cleomenes</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48736:16"/>
guessing at his meaning, reply'd, <hi>What do you say</hi> Lysandridas, <hi>sure you will not advise me to restore your City to you again? 'Tis that which I mean</hi>; Lysandridas <hi>reply'd, and I advise you not to ruin so brave a City, but to fill it with faithful and stedfast Friends and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, by restoring their Country to the</hi> Megalopolitans, <hi>and being the Saviour of so considerable a People. Cleomenes</hi> paus'd a while, and then said, <hi>'Tis very hard to trust so far in these Matters; but with us let Profit always yield to Glory.</hi> Having said this, he sent the two Men to <hi>Messena</hi> with a Trumpeter from himself, offering the <hi>Megalopolitans</hi> their City again, if they would forsake the <hi>Achaean</hi> Interest, and be on his side. Thô <hi>Cleomenes</hi> made these kind and obliging Proposals, yet <hi>Philopaemen</hi> would not suffer them to break their League with the <hi>Achaeans</hi>; and accusing <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to the People, as if his design was not to restore the City, but to take the Citizens too, he forc'd <hi>Thearidas</hi> and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandridas</hi> to leave <hi>Messena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was that <hi>Philopaemen,</hi> who was afterward Chief of the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> and a Man of the greatest Reputation amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as I have made it appear in his own Life. This News coming to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> though he had before taken such strict care that the City should not be plunder'd, yet then being in a Fury, and put out of all Patience, he rifled them of all their Coin, Plate and Jewels, and sent their Statues and Pictures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Sparta</hi>; and demolishing a great part of the City, he march'd away for fear of <hi>Antigonus</hi> and the <hi>Achaeans</hi>: but they never stirr'd, for they were in <hi>Aegium,</hi> at a Council of War. There <hi>Aratus</hi> mounted the Desk, wept a long while, and held his Mantle before his Face; and at last, the company being amaz'd, and commanding him to speak, he said, <hi>Megalopolis is ruin'd by</hi> Cleomenes, The Assembly was presently Dissolv'd; the <hi>Achae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> being extremely surpriz'd at the suddeness and greatness of the loss; and <hi>Antigonus</hi> intending to send speedy succors, when he found his Army to gather very slowly out of their Winter-Quarters, he sent them Orders to continue there still; and he himself march'd to <hi>Argos</hi> with a considerable Body of Men. The The second Enterprize of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> seem'd to be carry'd on by extreme Boldness and unaccountable Madness; but yet in <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>'s Opinion, was done upon mature Deliberation and exact Fore-sight: for knowing very well that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> were
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48736:16"/>
dispers'd into their Winter-Quarters, and that <hi>Antigonus</hi> with his Friends and a few Mercenaries about him, winter'd in <hi>Argos</hi>; upon these Considerations he invaded the Country of the <hi>Argives,</hi> hoping to shame <hi>Antigonus</hi> to a Battle upon unequal terms, or else if he did not dare to fight, to bring him into Disrepute with the <hi>Achaeans.</hi> And this according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hapned; for <hi>Cleomenes</hi> wasting, plundring, and spoiling the whole Countrey, the <hi>Argives</hi> vex'd at the loss, ran in Troops to the Palace of the King, and clamour'd that he should either fight, or surrender his Command to better and braver Men. But <hi>Antigonus,</hi> as became an experienc'd Captain, accounting it dishonourable, foolishly to hazard his Army, and quit his Security, and not to be abus'd and rail'd at by the Rabble, would not march out against <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> but stood fix'd to the Designs which he had laid: <hi>Cleomenes</hi> in the mean time brought his Army up to the very Walls, and having uncontroul'dly spoil'd the Countrey, and insulted o'er his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, drew off again. A little while after being advertis'd that <hi>Antigonus</hi> design'd for <hi>Tegea,</hi> and thence to make an Incursion into <hi>Laconia,</hi> he hastily march'd with his Army another way, and appear'd early in the morning before <hi>Argos,</hi> and wasted the Fields about it: the Corn he did not cut down with Reaping-hooks and Scythes, as Men usually do, but beat it down with Staves made like Scymetars, as if with a great deal of Contempt and wanton Scorn he spoil'd the Fields, and wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Country in his march; yet when his Soldiers would have set <hi>Cyllabris,</hi> the School of Exercise on Fire, he hindred the Attempt, reflecting upon serious consideration, that the Outrages committed at <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> were the effects of his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion rather than his Wisdom. He pretended to make such lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle account of, and so much to despise <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who first retir'd to <hi>Argos,</hi> and afterward plac'd Garisons on all the Mountains round about, that he sent a Trumpeter to desire the Keys of <hi>Heraeum,</hi> (<hi>Iuno</hi>'s Temple) that he might sacrifice to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess. Thus with a Scoff and bitter Reflection on <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and having sacrific'd to the Goddess<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under the Walls of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which was shut, he march'd to <hi>Phlius</hi>; and from thence driving out those that Garison'd <hi>Hologountum,</hi> he march'd down to <hi>Orchomenum.</hi> And these Enterprizes not only encourag'd the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48736:17"/>
Citizens, but made him appear to the very Enemies to be an experienc'd Captain, and very worthy of Command: for with the Strength of one City, not only to fight the Power of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and all the <hi>Poloponnesians</hi>; not only to preserve <hi>Laconia</hi> from being spoil'd, but to waste the Enemies Country, and to take so many and such considerable Cities, is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of no common Bravery. He that first said, <hi>That Money was the Sinews of Affairs,</hi> seem'd chiefly in that Saying to respect War: And <hi>Demades,</hi> when the <hi>Athenians</hi> had voted that a Navy should be made ready, but had no Money, said, <hi>They should make Bread before they thought of Sailing.</hi> And the old <hi>Archidamus,</hi> in the beginning of the <hi>Poloponnesian</hi> War, when the Allies desir'd, that each Parties share of Contributions for the War should be determin'd, is reported to have said, <hi>War cannot be kept to a set Diet</hi>: For as well breath'd Wrestlers do in time weary and tire out the most active and most skilful Combitant; so <hi>Antigonus</hi> coming to the War with a great stock of Wealth, weary'd out <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> whose Poverty made it difficult for him either to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Pay for the Mercenaries, or Provisions for the Citizens. For in all other Respects the Time favour'd <hi>Cleomenes</hi>; for <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi>'s Affairs at home began to be disturb'd: for the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> wasted and over-ran <hi>Macedonia</hi> whilst he was absent; and at that time a vast Army of the <hi>Illyrians</hi> came down: to be freed from whose Outrages, the <hi>Macedonians</hi> sent for <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and the Letters had almost been brought to him before the Battel was fought; upon the receipt of which he presently dislodg'd, and left the <hi>Achaeans</hi> Affairs to themselves. But Fortune, that loves to determine the greatest Affairs by a Minute, in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture show'd such an exact niceness of Time, that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the Battle in <hi>Sellasia</hi> was over, and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had lost his Army and his City, the Messengers reach'd <hi>Antigonus.</hi> And this made <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Misfortune more to be pitied; for if he had forborn fighting two days longer, there had been no need of hazarding a Battle, since upon the departure of the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> he might have had what Conditions he pleas'd from the <hi>Achaeans.</hi> But now (as I hinted before) for want of Money, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing necessitated to rely wholly on his Arms, he was forc'd with 20000 (this is <hi>Polybius</hi>'s Account) to engage thirty thousand; and approving himself an excellent Commander in this Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48736:17"/>
his Citizens showing an extraordinary Courage, and his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries Bravery enough; he was over-born by the different way of fighting, and the weight of the arm'd <hi>Phalanx.</hi> Besides, <hi>Phylarchus</hi> affirms, that the Treachery of some about him was the chief Cause of <hi>Cleomene</hi>'s Ruine. For <hi>Antigonus</hi> gave Orders, that the <hi>Illyrians</hi> and <hi>Acharnanians</hi> should march round by a secret way, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compass the other Wing which <hi>Eucleidas, Cleomenes</hi>'s Brother Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; and then drew out the rest of his Forces to the Battel. And <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> from a convenient Rising, viewing his Order, and not seeing any of the <hi>Illyrians</hi> and <hi>Acharnanians,</hi> began to suspect that <hi>Antigonus</hi> had sent them upon some such Design; and calling for <hi>Damoteles,</hi> who was to inspect and to provide against Ambushes, commanded him carefully to look after, and discover the Enemies Designs upon his Rear.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Damoteles</hi> (for some say <hi>Antigonus</hi> had brib'd him) telling him that he should not be solicitous about that matter, for all was well enough, but mind, and fight those that met him in the Front. He was satisfied, and advanc'd against <hi>Antigonus</hi>; and by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Charge of his <hi>Spartans,</hi> made the <hi>Macedonian Phalanx</hi> give ground, and press'd upon them with great Advantage about halfe a Mile; but then making a stand, and seeing the danger which the surrounded Wing commanded by his Brother <hi>Eucleidas</hi> was in, he cry'd out, <hi>Thou art lost, dear Brother, thou art lost, thou brave exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to our</hi> Spartan <hi>Youth, and Theme of our Matron's Songs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eucleidas</hi>'s Wing being thus cut in pieces, and the Conquerors from that part falling upon his Battle, he perceiv'd his Soldiers to be disorder'd, and unable to maintain the Fight, and therefore provided for his own safety. When he came into the City, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised those Citizens that he met, to receive <hi>Antigonus</hi>; and as for himself, he said, which should appear most advantageous to <hi>Sparta,</hi> whether his Life or Death, that he would chuse. Seeing the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men running out to those that fled with him, taking their Arms, and bring Drinking to them, he entred into his own House, and his Servant, which was a Free-born Woman, taken from <hi>Megalopolis</hi> after his Wife's Death, offering, as she us'd to do, to make neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Provision for him returning from the Battle; thô he was very thirsty, he refus'd to drink, and thô very weary, to sit down; but Arm'd as he was, he clapt his Arm side-way to a Pillar, and lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Forehead upon his Elbow, he rested his Body a little while, and ran over in his Thoughts what course he should take, and then
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48736:18"/>
with his Friends went presently to <hi>Gythium</hi>; where finding Ships fitted for the purpose, they embark'd. <hi>Antigonus</hi> taking the City, Treated the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> courteously, and neither affronting, nor ruining the Dignity of <hi>Sparta,</hi> but permitting them to enjoy their own Laws and Polity, and sacrificing to the Gods, dislodg'd the the third day: for he heard that there was a great War kindled in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and that the Country was spoil'd by the <hi>Barbarians</hi>; besides, he grew sick of a Consumption and continual Defluxion on the Lungs, yet he still kept up that he might return and free his own Country, and fall more Gloriously upon an heap of slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd <hi>Barbarians.</hi> As <hi>Phylarchus</hi> says, and 'tis probable, he broke a Vein by shouting in the Battle. In the Plays 'twas said, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Victory he cry'd out for Joy, <hi>O fine Day</hi>! and presently bringing up abundance of Blood, fell into a Fever, and dy'd in a short time. And thus much concerning <hi>Antigonus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> sailing from <hi>Cytherae,</hi> touch'd at another Island call'd <hi>Aegyalia,</hi> whence, as he was about to depart from <hi>Cyrene,</hi> one of his Friends, <hi>Therycion</hi> by name, a Man of an haughty Spirit in all Enterprizes, and high and boasting in his Talk, came privately to him, and said thus; <hi>Sir, Death in Battel, which is the most Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, we have let go; though all heard us say, that</hi> Antigonus <hi>should never tread over the King of</hi> Sparta, <hi>unless dead: And now, that which is next in Bravery and Glory, is presented to us. Whither do we madly sail, flying that which is near, and seeking that which is far removed? For if it is not dishonourable for the Race of</hi> Hercules, <hi>to serve the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors of</hi> Philip <hi>and</hi> Alexander, <hi>we shall save a long Voyage by delivering our selves up to</hi> Antigonus, <hi>who probably surpasseth</hi> Ptolomy <hi>as much as the</hi> Macedonians <hi>do the</hi> Aegyptians; <hi>but if we think it mean to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to those whose Arms have conquer'd us, why should we chuse him for our Lord by whom we have not yet been beaten? Is it that instead of one we might appear meaner than two, whilst we fly</hi> Antigonus, <hi>and flatter</hi> Ptolemy? <hi>Or, is it for your Mothers sake that you retreat to</hi> Aegypt? <hi>It will indeed be a very fine, and very desirable sight for her to be shown her Son by</hi> Ptolemy<hi>'s Women, now chang'd from a Prince into an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile and a Slave. Are we not still Masters of our own Swords? And whilst we have</hi> Laconia <hi>in view, shall we not here free our selves from this disgraceful Misery, and clear our selves to those, who at</hi> Sellasia <hi>dy'd for the Honour and Defence of</hi> Sparta? <hi>Or, shall we sit lazily in</hi> Aegypt <hi>enquiring what News from</hi> Sparta? <hi>and whom</hi> Antigonus <hi>hath been pleas'd to make Governor of</hi> Lacedemon? Thus spoke <hi>Therycion</hi>; and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48736:18"/>
this was <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Reply; <hi>By seeking Death, you Coward, the most easie, and most ready Refuge, you fancy that you shall appear coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and brave, though this Flight is baser than thy former. Better Men than we have given way to their Enemies, having been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd by Fortune, or oppress'd by Multitude; but he that sinks under La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or Afflictions, the Opinions or Reproaches of Men, is overcome by his own Effeminacy and Softness: For a voluntary Death ought not to be chosen as a Relief from Action, but an Exemplary Action it self; and 'tis base either to live or die only to our selves. That Death to which you now invite us, I propos'd only as a Release from our present Miseries, but carries nothing of Bravery or Profit in it. And I think it becomes both me and you not to despair of our Country; but when there are no hopes of that left, those that have an Inclination may quickly die.</hi> To this <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rycion</hi> return'd no Answer; but as soon as he could get out of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omenes</hi>'s Company, went toward the Shore, and ran himself through. But <hi>Cleomenes</hi> sailed from <hi>Aegialia,</hi> landed in <hi>Lybia,</hi> and being honourably conducted through the King's Country, came to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> When he was first brought to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> no more than common Civilities, and usual Ceremonies were paid him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when, upon tryal, he found him a Man of deep Sense, and great Reason, and that his plain <hi>Laconick</hi> way of Conversation car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a free Pleasantness with it, that he did nothing unbecoming the greatness of his Birth, nor bent under Fortune, and appear'd a more faithful Counsellor, than those who made it their business to please and flatter; he was asham'd, and repented that he had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected so great a Man, and suffer'd <hi>Antigonus</hi> to get so much Power and Reputation by ruining him. Therefore he heap'd up Honours and Kindnesses on <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and gave him Hopes that he would furnish him with an Army and a Navy to recover <hi>Greece,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>instate him in his Throne. Besides, he allow'd him a yearly Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of four and twenty Tallents; a little part of which Sum sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his and his Friends thrifty Temperance; and the rest was imploy'd in doing good Offices to, and in relieving the Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of those that fled <hi>Greece,</hi> and retir'd into <hi>Aegypt.</hi>

            <p>But the elder <hi>Ptolomy</hi> dying before <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Affairs had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a full Dispatch, and the Successor being a loose, voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and effeminate Prince, under the power of his Pleasures and his Women, his Business was neglected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the King was so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sotted with his Women and his Wine, that Balls, Musick and Dancing, were the only Employments of his most busie and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48736:19"/>
hours, and the greatest Affairs of State were manag'd by <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoclea</hi> the King's Mistress, her Mother, and the Pimp <hi>Oinanthes.</hi> Therefore at the first they seem'd to stand in need of <hi>Cleomenes</hi>; for <hi>Ptolemy</hi> being afraid of his Brother <hi>Magas,</hi> who by his Mother's means had a great Interest among the Soldiers, took <hi>Cleomenes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Cabinet-Council, and acquainted him with the Design of taking off his Brother. He, though all were for it, declar'd his opinion to the contrary, saying, <hi>The King, if it were possible, should have more Brothers for the better security and management of his Affairs:</hi> And <hi>Sosibius,</hi> the greatest Favourite, replying, <hi>That they were not secure of the Mercenaries whilst</hi> Magas <hi>was alive? Cleomenes</hi> return'd, <hi>That he need not trouble himself about that Matter; for amongst the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries there were above</hi> 3000 Pelopponesians, <hi>who were his fast Friends, and whom he could command at any time with his Nod.</hi> This Discourse made <hi>Cleomenes</hi> for the present to be look'd upon as a Man of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and Power; but afterwards (<hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Weakness increasing his Fear, and, as it usually happens, where there is no Judgment and Wisdom at the bottom, placing his Security in Jealousie and Suspicion) rendred <hi>Cleomenes</hi> suspected to the Courtiers, as having too much Interest with the Mercenaries; and many had this Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Mouths, <hi>That he was a Lion midst a flock of Sheep</hi>: for such he seem'd to be in the Court, slyly overlooking and taking notice of the management of Affairs; therefore when he desir'd a Navy and an Army from the King, his Petition was rejected. But when he understood that <hi>Antigonus</hi> was dead, that the <hi>Achaians</hi> were engag'd in a War with the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and that the Affairs of <hi>Pelopponnesus,</hi> being now in very great Distraction and Distress, requir'd and invited his Assistance, he desir'd leave to depart only with his Friends, but could not obtain that, the King not so much as hearing his Petition, being shut up amongst his Women, and wasting his Hours in Debauchery and Frolicks. But <hi>Sosibius,</hi> the chief Minister of State, thought that <hi>Cleomones</hi> being detain'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his will, would grow ungovernable and dangerous, and yet that it was not safe to let him go, being an aspiring, daring Man, and well acquainted with the Diseases and Weakness of the Kingdom; for no Presents, no Gifts, could win him to a Comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. But as the Ox <hi>Apis,</hi> though revelling in all possible plenty and delight, yet desires to live as nature would provide for him, to be at liberty, and frisk about the Fields, and can scarce endure to be uuder the Priests keeping; so he could not brook their Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and tender Entertainment, but like <hi>Achilles,</hi>
               <q>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:48736:19"/>
                  <l>Whilst there, his heart did waste with secret grief,</l>
                  <l>And he was eager for the noisy Wars.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>His Affairs standing in this condition, <hi>Nicagoras</hi> the <hi>Messenian</hi> came to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> a Man that deeply hated <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be his Friend; for he had formerly sold <hi>Cleomenes</hi> a fair Estate, but never receiv'd the Money, because <hi>Cleomenes</hi> was either unable, (as it may be) or else, by reason of his engagement in the Wars and other Distractions, had no time to pay him. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> seeing him landing, (for he was then walking upon the Key) kindly saluted him, and ask'd, <hi>What Business brought to</hi> Aegypt? <hi>Nicagoras</hi> return'd his Compliment, and told him, <hi>That he came to bring some excellent War-horses to the King.</hi> And <hi>Cleomenes</hi> with a Smile subjoyn'd, <hi>I wish you had rather brought Pimps, Whores, and Pathicks; for those now are the King's chief Delight. Nicagoras</hi> at the present smil'd at the Conceit; but a few days after he put <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> in mind of the Estate that he had bought of him, and desir'd his Money, protesting that he would not have trouble him, if his Merchandize had turned to that Account, which he thought it would. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> reyly'd, That he had not a penny left of all that had been given him: At which Answer <hi>Nicagoras</hi> being nettled, told <hi>Sosibius Cleomenes</hi>'s Scoff upon the King. He caress'd him for the Discovery, but desiring to have some greater Reason to excite the King against <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> persuaded <hi>Nicagoras</hi> to leave a Letter written against <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> importing that he had a Design, if he could have gotten Ships and Soldiers, to surprize <hi>Cyrene: Nicago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> wrote such a Letter, and left <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Four days after <hi>Sosibius</hi> brought the Letter to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> pretending it was just then deliver'd him, and with a bitter Invective excited the Fury of the Youth; upon this it was agreed, that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> should be invited into a large Apartment, and treated as formerly, but not suffer'd to go out again: this Usage was grievous to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Accident, his Hopes for the future seem'd to be quite dash'd. <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> the Son of <hi>Chrysermas,</hi> a Favourite of the Kings, always carried himself fairly towards <hi>Cleomenes</hi>; they contracted a near Acquaintance, and would talk freely together about the State. He upon <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Desire came to him, had some Discourse with him, upon a few and inconsiderable Subjects, to avoid suspicion, and made some Excuses for the King; but as he went out again, not knowing that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> follow'd him to the Door, he very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48736:20"/>
reprimanded the Keepers, for their Carelessness in looking after so great and so furious a wild Beast. This <hi>Cleomenes</hi> himself heard, and retiring before <hi>Ptolomy</hi> perceiv'd it, told his Friends what he had heard. Upon this they cast off all their former Hopes, and determin'd for violent Proceedings, resolving to be reveng'd on <hi>Ptolomy</hi> for his base and unjust Dealing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to have satisfaction for the Affronts, to die as it became <hi>Spartans,</hi> and not stay till, like fatted Sacrifices, they were Butcher'd: for 'twas both grievous and dishonourable for <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> who had scorn'd to come to Terms with <hi>Antigonus,</hi> a brave Warrior, and a Man of Action, to wait an effeminate King's leisure, till he should lay aside his Fiddle, and end his Dance, and then kill him. These Courses being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd on, and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> hapning at the same time to make a Progress to <hi>Canopus,</hi> they first spread abroad a Report, that his Freedom was order'd by the King; and it being the King's custom, to send Presents and an Entertainment to those whom he would free, <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omenes</hi> Friends made that Provision, and sent it into the Prison, thereby deceiving the Keepers, who thought it had been sent by the King; for he sacrific'd, and gave them large Pottions, and with a Crown upon his Head feasted and made merry with his Friends: 'tis said, that he began the Action sooner than he design'd, having understood that a Servant of one of the Accomplices lay abroad with a Mistress that he lov'd. This made him afraid of a Discovery; and therefore as soon as it was full Noon, and all the Keepers drunk and fast asleep, he put on his Coat, and opening the Seam on his right Shoulder, with his drawn Sword in his hand he issued forth, together with his Friends, provided in the same manner, making 13 in all. One of them, by Name <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi> was lame, he follow'd the first Onset very well; but when afterward he perceiv'd that they were more slow in their Advances for his sake, he desir'd them to run him through, and not ruine their Enterprize, by staying for an useless, unprofitable Man. By chance an <hi>Alexandrian</hi> was then riding by the Door, him they threw off, and setting <hi>Hippotas</hi> on Horseback, ran through the narrow Lanes, and proclaim'd Liberty to the People; but they, it seems, had Courage enough to praise and admire <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but not one had the heart to follow and assist him. Three of them fell on <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> the Son of <hi>Chrysermas,</hi> as he was coming out of the Palace, and kill'd him: Another <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the City, advancing against them in a Chariot, they set
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48736:20"/>
upon, dispers'd his Guards and Attendants, and pulling him out of the Chariot, kill'd him upon the place. Then they made toward the Castle, designing to break open the Prison, and take the Prisoners to their Assistance; but the Keepers were too quick for them, and secur'd the Passages. Being baffled in this attempt, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> with his Company roam'd about the City, none joyning with him, but all retreating from, and flying his approach: therefore despairing of Success, and saying to his Friends, That it was no wonder that Women rul'd o'er those Men that fled Liberty, he excited them all to dye as bravely as became his Followers, and Men of their Glorious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances. This said, <hi>Hippotas</hi> was first, as he desir'd, run through by one of the young Men, and then each of them readily and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely fell upon his own Sword, except <hi>Panteus,</hi> that <hi>Panteus</hi> that first surpriz'd <hi>Megalopolis.</hi> This Man being a very handsom Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and a better Companion than any of the Youth, the King lov'd, and bade him, when he had seen him and the rest fall'n, dye, by their Example. <hi>Panteus</hi> walk'd over them as they lay, and prick'd every one with his Dagger, to try whether any was alive; when he prick'd <hi>Cleomenes</hi> in the Leg, and saw him turn upon his Back, he kiss'd him, sate down by him, and when he was quite dead, cover'd his Carkass, and then kill'd himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Body.</p>
            <p>Thus fell <hi>Cleomenes,</hi>, that great, brave Man, after he had been king of <hi>Sparta</hi> sixteen Years. The news of their Fall being nois'd through the City, <hi>Cratesilaea,</hi> though a Woman of a great Spirit, could not bear up against the insupportable weight of this Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but embracing <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Children, made grievous Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; but the eldest Boy, none suspecting such a Spirit in a Child, threw himself headlong from the top of the House; he was bruis'd very much, but not kill'd by the Fall, and was taken up crying, and expressing his Resentments for not being permitted to destroy himself. <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> as soon as an account of the Action was brought him, gave order that <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Body should be Flea'd and hung up; that his Children, Mother, and the Women that were with her, should be kill'd. Amongst those was <hi>Panteus</hi>'s Wife, a very fair Woman, and of a stately Carriage, who had been but newly Married, and suffer'd these disasters in the height of her Love. Her Parents would not let her embark with <hi>Panteus</hi> presently after they were Married, though she eagerly desir'd it,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48736:21"/>
but shut her up, and kept her by violence at home; yet a few days after she got a Horse and a little Money, and escaping by Night, made speed to <hi>Taenarus,</hi> where she embark'd for <hi>Aegypt,</hi> came to her Husband, and with him cheerfully endur'd to live in a Foreign Country. She led <hi>Cratesiclaea</hi> as she was going with the Soldiers to Execution, help up her Train, and begg'd her to be courageous, who of her self was not in the least afraid of Death, and desir'd nothing else, but only to be kill'd before the Children. When they were come to the place of Execution, the Children were first kill'd before <hi>Cratesiclaea</hi>'s Eyes, and afterward she her self, with only these words in her Mouth; <hi>O Children, whither <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> you gone?</hi> But <hi>Pantaeus</hi>'s Wife girding her Garments close to her, and being a strong Woman, without any Noise or Lamentation, lookt after every one that was slain, and wound them up as well as her present Circumstances would permit; and after all, were kill'd, dressing her self, bound her Cloaths close about her, and suffering none to come near, or be an Eye-witness of her Fall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the Executioner, she courageously submitted to the stroak, and wanted no body to look after her, or wind her up after she was dead. Thus in her Death the Modesty of her Mind appear'd, and set the Guard upon her Body, which she always kept when alive: And she in the declining Age of the <hi>Spartans</hi> shew'd, That Women were no unequal Rivals of the Men, and was an Instance of such a Courage as would not sneak to the Affronts of Fortune. A few days after, those that watch'd the hanging Body of <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> saw a very great Snake winding about his Head, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Face, so that no Bird of Prey should fly at it. This made the King superstitiously afraid, and set the Women upon several Lustrations, as if he had been an extraordinary Man, and one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd by the Gods that had been slain. And the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> made Processions to the Place, and gave <hi>Cleomenes</hi> the Title of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe,</hi> and Son of the Gods, till the Philosophers satisfied them, by saying, That, <hi>as Oxen breed Bees, putrifying Horses breed Hornets, and Beetles rise from the Carkasses of dead Asses, so the Humours and Iuices of the Marrow of a Man's Body coagulating, produce Serpents.</hi> And this the Ancients observing, appropriated a Serpent rather than any other Creature to Heroe's.</p>

               <l>That none but Men of Wit and Sence are here:</l>
               <l>That our Bear-Garden Friends are all away,</l>
               <l>Who bounce with Hands and Feet, and cry Play, Play.</l>
               <l>Who to save Coach-hire, trudge along the Street,</l>
               <l>Then print our Matted Seats with dirty Feet;</l>
               <l>Who, while we speak, make Love to Orange-Wenches,</l>

               <l>A Merry-Andrew, such a Mob will serve,</l>
               <l>And treat 'em with such Wit as they deserve:</l>

               <l>They'll take 'em Black and White for <hi>Irish</hi> Cattle.</l>

               <l>Controul those Foplings, and declare for Sence:</l>
