            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT has pleaſed the Almighty
Power that Rules the Hearts
of Princes, to Englighten and
Adorn His Preſent Gracious

Beams of Mercy and Clemency,
thoſe truly Royal Vertues, that

               </gap> he is: To win
therefore the Univerſal Love of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
a Conqueſt worthy of, and indeed
reſerved for His Great Self; He has ſet
up His Standard of Compaſſion, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to recover the Alienated Affections
of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe of His Subjects, whom the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of His Predeceſſours may have
any ways rendred uneaſie.</p>
            <p>There are but two things in the World
dear to all Mankind; Religion and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty:
The laſt of theſe I confeſs, in the
moſt moderate Diſtribution of common
Right, has all along had its free Courſe
in the true Channels of Equity; only the
firſt has been a little reſtrained; for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience

has ſometimes been ſhackled.</p>
            <p>The Sighs therefore, and Groans that
have lately breathed from that Reſtraint,
have moved him to that Sacred Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration,
that He is reſolved to break
the Fetters that Extort them, the <hi>Penal
Laws;</hi> which to Effect, He has already
declared His Determination, for that
choice of Magiſtrates in Authority under
him, that in His Princely Wiſdom, He
thinks will be moſt hearty in Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their beſt and ableſt Endeavours for
that Great End.</p>
            <p>To carry on this Pious Work, it is not
at all in Reaſon to be doubted, but the
Suffering Party on all ſides, who are ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved
by thoſe Laws, by the meer Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of Self-preſervation, will be no
ways wanting to throw off a Yoke they
have ſo long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo unquietly born: And if
all their helps (as may be expected) His
Majeſty is ſecure of, there remains only
the Concurrence of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi>
which if obtained, His Kingdom
will reap the <hi>Fruit,</hi> and Himſelf the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
of being the Founder of thoſe laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bleſſings, ſo much in themſelves the
more glorious, as that all Hands and all
Hearts, ſhall be aſſiſtant to their Creation.</p>
            <p>The Deſign therefore of this Addreſs,
to my Pious Mother the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
is truly and fairly to reaſon with
her, why the Preſervation of thoſe Laws,
either is, or ought to be any part of her
Care; and indeed, how far thoſe <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi>
her ſometimes Darlings, are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
either Juſt, Equitable, or conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
with Chriſtianity it ſelf? And how
far ſhe is equally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if not more than the
<hi>Diſſenters,</hi> obliged to Aboliſh them? Nor
ſhall I endeavour to urge her Conſent
from any Reſignation or Compliance
(thoſe fainter Motives of meer Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity)
to the Pleaſure and Will of the
King, that deſires to have it ſo; but En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
the Argument from the Bonds and
Tyes of Conſcience and Juſtice, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
her Aſſiſtance to their Diſſolution;
and hereby Illuſtrate the Equity and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs
of His Majeſty's Propoſal,
and prove the Work it ſelf, no more than
the incumbent Duty of every Chriſtian
Subject, to labour to perfect. For Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
therefore into the <hi>Penal Laws, I</hi> ſhall
make bold to Trace the Grounds of their
Riſe and Original: And to take them in
Order, I muſt firſt begin with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt,</hi>
as being the firſt that fell under
their Laſh.</p>
            <p>After the Death of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
[for 'twill ſuffice to ſet out here] her
Proteſtant Siſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſucceeding
in the Throne, under ſo fair a Proſpect
of Eſtabliſhing her Religion, as having
at that time the Half, if not the Majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Nation, of her own Perſwaſion;
all Hands were ſet at Work for ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
an Enterprize: But the main En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
was, That the Reformers having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Eyes, the late Severity of her
Siſters Reign, the Proteſtant Church, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
truely, or rather ſeemingly aſhamed,
[as time will ſhew] was conſcious
that ſhe had no means ſo proper to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
her ſelf to the People's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem,
as the avoiding all thoſe Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Odium,</hi> which had rendred the
<hi>Romiſh</hi> Church ſo much the Object of
their Averſion; and therefore the
change muſt be wrought, and Affections
won, by the oppoſite Extreams of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Moderation.</p>
            <p>Theſe foſter Meaſures for a while,
were endeavoured to be rendred her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Fundamental Principles, and one of
her proudeſt Diſtinguiſhing Characters
from her ſeverer Predeceſſours. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las!
In few years, Indulgence appeared

their Worſhip, their Church though fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,

even its Ruines: And perhaps, the
<hi>Romiſh Prieſts,</hi> though thrown out of
Church Preſerment, could not, or would
not forbear to Confirm, and Encourage
their thin and ſcatterr'd Party; and
poſſibly, through an Indiſpenſable (as
they thought) Duty to that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in which perſwaded, they only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Salvation; they might not (to
give all Perſwaſions their due in this
Point) omit either Arguments or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
(as Opinion wants neither) to
render their Religion never the leſs
lovely, for the Cloud it wore, which
indeed is but natural to all Religions,
whilſt they think their own, the only,
or at leaſt, the neareſt way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>Theſe Remora's, how ſmall Stops ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
to her advancing Glory, the Church
of <hi>England</hi> beholding with Impatience,
and Repining even at her ſmalleſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours

the leaſt Impediments to her yet unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
Ambition, (for to be uppermoſt,

way, for the Weeding out of
Popery; and to look out for a ſharper
Pruning-Hook, than meer Teaching
and Preaching, to do the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:
Set agog therefore upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch
and Execution, ſhe felt the Itch
of her Fore-fathers; and if Honour and

Is either the Life, or Dignity of the

Can Faith in God be Treaſon againſt

Can a Chriſtians beſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

If Errors in Faith can amount

            <p>But laying the charge of <hi>High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>

               </gap>t's all that too any more than meer

the leaſt ſhadow of the Subjects Breach
of Duty to the Soveraign. For all that

Spiritual, in Deciſion of Points of Faith,

in all Reigns, being utterly denied all
Temporal or Civil Juriſdiction whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
Nay, ſo tender has the Royal
Prerogative been here in <hi>England,</hi> that
the very Laws of the Land, even in the

Provided, that no Canons from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal

in Favour of their Pope, to be Compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

and if St. <hi>Paul</hi> may be believed,

Letter of this Law; yet they'll tell you
'tis nothing but high Juſtice againſt
the Romiſh Prieſt, as taking Orders
from <hi>Rome,</hi> in themſelves little leſs than
Damnable and Diabolical, as received
from the Papal See, the very Seat of
Antichriſt; and then returning home,

            <p>To this Thundering Charge, as big
as it ſounds, (to ſhow the Weakneſs
even of the greateſt Strength of their

ſhort Reply.</p>
            <p>If the Church of <hi>England</hi> has, and
always does admit a Convert Romiſh
Prieſt, into the Proteſtant Clergy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Re-ordination to Capacitate
him for that Admiſſion, (as we need
look no farther than to the conſtant
Practice of the Church, without ſo
much as one Example to the contrary,
from the very Beginning of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation)
how unjuſtly are taking Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

If the Orders from <hi>Rome</hi> be

               </gap>n?
And how the taking of them <hi>High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</hi>
If not Holy nor Sacred, (as if
<hi>High Treaſon</hi> in the very receiving of
them, they cannot be) does the Church
of <hi>England</hi> entertain Paſtors into her
Miniſterial Function Unconſecrated, for
the Divine Service of Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid!
No; the very Practice and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of the Church in this Caſe,
does ſo confront the palpable Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of this Statute, that nothing can be
plainer.</p>
            <p>And if ſuch are the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Orders,

God, and the Church we hope to be
ſaved in, be in our own Election, (for
our own Souls are anſwerable for it)
by the ſame liberty of choice; why
may not a zealous Believer be his own
chooſer, whether he will be a Member
or Paſtor of the Flock he owns, as his
own Abilities to ſerve God in either
Station ſhall dictate to him? And why
are men Baniſh'd, and Excluded from
their Native Right, in the Kingdom in
which they are born, for only endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to ſecure themſelves, their no
leſs Native Right in that of Heaven?</p>
            <p>One Obſervation in the <hi>Statute</hi> of
the Fifth of Her Reign, I had almoſt
forgotten, not a little worthy Remark:
In this <hi>Statute,</hi> where the In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>apacity of

Supremacy, (for a Refuſal of an
Oath in that Caſe, is only a Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Incapacity of taking it) is made
<hi>High Treaſon:</hi> In one Clauſe of it the
Queen is pleaſed to tell us, <hi>She is ſo

            </p>
            <p>What Contradictious and Cob-webb-Laws

the whole Statute ſuch an Arbitrary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration

            <p>Now as this is the Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or unwarrantable ſoever all ſuch
Penal Inflictions for meer Conſcience may
be, the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> has, or at leaſt fancies
ſhe has ſome little pretext for ſuch Laws.
For under her Famous Tenent of <hi>extra Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiam
nulla ſalus,</hi> and her conſinement of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
only within her own Boundaries, ſhe
may have ſometimes conſented to the
practice of cutting off a <hi>ſtray Sheep,</hi> to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie
the reſt of the Flock from leaping the
Fold, as imagining to her ſelf in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and in Sacrificing ſome loſt Sons of
Perdition (for ſuch ſhe accounts them) and
thereby lopping off ſome corrupt Member,
already paſt hope of Redemption, ſhe only
ſecures poſſibly the whole Body, as ſhe
thinks, from <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> and <hi>Damnation.</hi> And
conſequently ſuch examplary Acts, though
of the greateſt Rigour, how miſtaken ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
are only intended as abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for that great end, Vniverſal
Salvation. But, alas! our more chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Church, that dares not bound the
Grace of God, but by a larger Latitude,
and more extended Operation of the Blood
of Chriſt, equally allows Salvation to true
Zeal and Piety in <hi>both Churches,</hi> and indeed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30003:7"/>
in all <hi>Chriſtian Profeſſions:</hi> Under all this
Conceſſion, I ſay, our <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi>
utterly wants this Loop-hole, &amp; upon true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
will be found wholly Inexcuſable:
for in Executing of her Sanguinary Laws
in Puniſhment of meer matter of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
ſhe cuts off, not like <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<hi>Members of Perdition,</hi> but even thoſe
<hi>Profeſſors of Chriſtianity,</hi> which by her own
Confeſſion may be equally with her ſelf the
<hi>Sons of Grace</hi> and <hi>Co-heires of Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, I'l venture to add one bold Word
more, becauſe a true one, The <hi>Church of
England</hi> in her once Executing of her <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary
Laws,</hi> is undoubtedly guilty of
more Barbarity then the <hi>Ten Primitive Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Perſecutions.</hi> For in all caſes of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for Religion, 'tis an undeniable Maxim,
That <hi>He that makes the Martyr leaſt thinks
he makes him.</hi> The Bloodieſt <hi>Pagan Tyrants</hi>
in all the ſtudied Arts of <hi>Torments, Blood</hi>
and <hi>Chriſtian Maſſacre,</hi> did not believe that
they Butchered the then only <hi>Profeſſors of
Truth</hi> and <hi>Heires of Heaven;</hi> but on the
contrary, in Devotion to their own ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
true Deities, they thought they only
Executed <hi>Apoſtates, Blaſphemers</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi>
for ſuch they accounted the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as
profeſt Deſerters of their <hi>Heathen Gods</hi> and
<hi>Sacrifices:</hi> But all this while our <hi>Church of
England</hi> (I am ſorry to her ſhame it muſt be
ſpoken) out does the very <hi>Heathens</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
in Enacting and Executing thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt
<hi>Penal Cruelties,</hi> by which ſhe Ruins,
Deſtroys, or Cuts off thoſe very Members
of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> who (if true Zealots in
their Profeſſion) ſhe owns are in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the <hi>Elect of God;</hi> and if any true
Zealots amongſt them, thoſe certainly that
have courage to ſuffer <hi>Gaols, Sequeſtrations,
Baniſhments, &amp;c.</hi> even to the conſtancy of
<hi>dying</hi> for their <hi>Religion,</hi> are not the leaſt of
them; and conſequently ſhe cannot deny,
but in Executing thoſe Laws, ſhe both
makes the <hi>Martyr,</hi> and <hi>knows</hi> ſhe makes him
too. And if ſhe's ſo blameable in her Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
againſt the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> much more
criminal muſt her Rigour againſt the <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
be, whom ſhe owns to differ from her
ſelf in little more then <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and
<hi>Punctilios,</hi> by her own Confeſſion no ways
eſſential to Salvation.</p>
            <p>Nay, the Ferment has ſometimes boil'd
ſo high, that our <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> has put
her Zeal upon the ſtretch to find means to
vent her Indignation, when ſome of thoſe
very Laws againſt Recuſancy have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
againſt the <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters,</hi> &amp; the
greateſt part of their Sufferings received
from the Laſh of thoſe Laws. I ſhall not
pretend to dive ſo far, as to aſcertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that comprehenſion was Originally
<hi>Deſigned</hi> by thoſe Laws, or otherwiſe, an
Artificial <hi>Superſtructure</hi> to ſerve a State turn;
but either way the Severity of thoſe Laws
is not a little notorious, where ſo trivial
matters of Diſſent in Religion, as has
been ſaid before, have been ſo cruelly
treated.</p>
            <p>But if our <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be reconciled to <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi>
and therefore theſe Laws were her Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
againſt it, her more generous way, at
leaſt more agreeable to a Chriſtian Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
had been firſt fairely to have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
it by dint of Argument, before ſhe
made uſe of dint of Steel to do it by; and
for that purpoſe, I wonder how that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi> has paſt for ſo great a
Doctor of the Church, all this while, and
his Treatiſe upon that Subject, called,
<hi>Liberty of Propheſying,</hi> not yet anſwered;
or why at leaſt was not the Author under
no ſmall Eccleſiaſtical Fulminations (if no
other way to anſwer it) for ſo terrible a
Blow, againſt the Churches long main fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
Bulwark, her <hi>Penal Laws.</hi> 'Tis
true I confeſs, all other means failing, they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:30003:7"/>
lighted upon one incomperable Stratagem
to confute it, (for 'tis in Controverſie as 'tis
in War, where open Force cannot Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,

at all other Weapons, after the late

            <p>'Tis true, ſome People will object, <hi>What
are all theſe Laws to the Church, when enacted

            <p>I confeſs indeed we have had many late
Pulpit Diſcourſes on this Subject, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ſoftening Perſwaſions urged, to throw
off this Severity on the Temporal Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration:
But truly, to our Churches great
misfortune, her numerous Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the peculiar Bolts of her own ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Vengeance, and the Goalings that have
followed thoſe Thunder-Peales, are ſuch

then the more immediate Oracles of

            <p>And this the great Legiſlators of thoſe
<hi>Penal Statutes</hi> very well knew, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

converted <hi>Recuſancy</hi> into high <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and

muſt have out gone the due bounds of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,

So that upon the Iſſue not only that Young
King and our Primitive Doctors muſt be in
the wrong for intending any ſuch further
Reform, or our preſent Reformers in the
wrong, for ſo loudly quarreling the leaſt
attempt of ſuch a Reform, as ſo guilty and
ſo black an Apoſtacy.</p>
            <p>I cannot tell what Equity wiſer Heads
may find out for the Ordination of <hi>Penal

A far ſhorter Catalogue of Sufferers I am

<hi>Martyrs,</hi> that have done our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
the honour to breath out their laſt
in her <hi>Penal Jayls;</hi> beſides ſome of them
that have taſted her kinder ſtroke of Mercy
from the quicker Diſpatch of Halters. The
number of both which upon inquiry made,
has been found to amount to near ſix Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>
            <p>To return therefore to his Majeſties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
of Abrogating theſe Laws, tis a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Duty upon the <hi>Church of England</hi> to
aboliſh them, then in the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
for as tis a Yoke impoſed upon their
weaker Brethren, in it ſelf wholly unjuſt,
the Sufferer under that Yoke in indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to break it, only Acts by the motives
of ſelf-defence, the common Principle of
Nature: But the Impoſer of that Yoke is
tied by the Obligation of Religion it ſelf,
to repeal and repent his own Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.</p>
            <p>Beſides If all arguments of Conſcience
cannot prevail; and Policy not Equity
(though Heaven forbid ſo uncharitable a
thought) is our Churches guide; yet, even
then too, what does ſhe yeild up in aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe Laws; why, truly nothing;
for whilſt the Government continues in
the Hands of a Prince of the <hi>Romiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
thoſe Statutes will utterly lye dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for the <hi>Royal Indulgence,</hi> a Prerogative in

What reaſon therefore has the
<hi>Church of England</hi> for her Nonconcurrence
to a propoſal ſo Equitable, when ſhe has
not ſo much as the leaſt pretext even of
meer Intereſt it ſelf for her refuſal?</p>
            <p>But this I am ſure, as the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
can have no ſolid Reaſons to oppoſe
their Repeal, the <hi>State</hi> has very ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

the Wealth of the World (beſides the
opening that current of Commerce, even

reſtraint of Worſhip at all times ſo much
ſhut up) than <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi> Nor

making his Kingdom a true Paradice of
Peace and Plenty, but by taking this pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
at the leaſt from the firſt Paradice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that is, by making the <hi>Lyon</hi> and <hi>Lamb</hi> lye
down in Peace together; our long diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being no otherwiſe to be reconciled,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30003:9"/>
and our Enmities huſht but by this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
univerſal Pacification.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add this laſt Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
the Execution of our <hi>Penal Laws,</hi>
and the Reſtraint of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> has been
the greateſt Blow that ever was given
to the Hereditary Right of the Subjects
of <hi>England,</hi> their natural Properties
and Immunities given and Sealed to
them by <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it ſelf. For who
can call his Liberty or Eſtate his own,
whilſt a Superiour Opinion in Power
ſhall ſeize our Perſons, and confiſcate
our Eſtates, for no other cauſe but
difference of Worſhip and Faith, and
neither Perſon, Eſtate or Liberty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable
under a leſs Compoſition
then renouncing of God; for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of Worſhip abſolutely againſt
Conſcience is little leſs. And all this
capital offence ſo unfixt, and ſo undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
a ſort of Tranſgreſſion, that a
Man has only a meer Lottery to be in
the Right or the Wrong: For the
blackeſt Criminal in one Reign, has
been the whiteſt Saint in the next,
and ſo <hi>Vice Verſa</hi> over again, witneſs
the Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, <hi>Queen
Mary</hi> and <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> where the
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> were the Devils one while,
and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> another: Nay, in the
Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight both <hi>Papiſt</hi>
and <hi>Proteſtant</hi> were at one time in the
wrong: For t'was remarkable in his
Reign, that in the ſame day have <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi>
been Hanged for <hi>Traytors,</hi> for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning
his <hi>Church Supremacy;</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi>
Burnt for <hi>Heriticks,</hi> for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> Thus in their
turns have all Religions and Opinions
lain under the Scourge of the ſevereſt
of Laws, and all for want of that Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to a Law, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Humanity it
ſelf is utterly unable to pay. For
though our breach or not breach of all
other Laws, either Human or Divine,
lyes in our own free will and choice;
to conform or not conform to this or
that Belief, is wholly above the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Man; Faith only being irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
And if our wordly well-being, and
all we enjoy in this Life, depends upon
ſuch Capricious Decrees of Law, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the great <hi>Charter</hi> of our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Eſtates that confirmed 'em
both under no ſuch condition or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction
is not a little invaded by
the Penalties of ſuch Laws: Nor is
Reſtraint of Conſcience and the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of our <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> in their own
nature and tendency only deſtructive
to the rightfull Liberty of <hi>Engliſh-Men,</hi>
but the very Letter of thoſe Laws
themſelves has made the moſt viſible
Rupture into the very ſtrongeſt Walls
of our <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> that is our Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
by our Peeres, by a Jury of Twelve,
our <hi>Magna Charta</hi> more particularly
confirmes to us that hereditary right,
and our <hi>Penal Laws</hi> moſt notoriouſly
take it from us. For inſtance 22 <hi>Car.</hi>

Liturgy, the Adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and indeed all the Canons and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles

            <p>The ſtrength of theſe two Laws, His

that may, or ſhall be offer'd to His

then be the whole buſineſs that lies before

Judge any more incapacitated for the

man? Moreover, in a Kingdom where
their Number is ſo truly inconſiderable,
as ſcarce the two hundredth man in the
Nation, if they have hopes of making any
Converts, or any endeavours that way,
it can only be done by holding the Scale
of Juſtice upright, and in all Poſts of
Truſt, by keeping up the ſteddieſt Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
of Right and Equity, as the only
means thereby to recommend and endear
themſelves to the World, and wipe off
thoſe blemiſhes that the miſtaken Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
and popular Miſapprehenſions have ſo
long, ſo unkindly caſt upon them. And
this, and this only, they are very ſenſible
is their Chart to ſteer by; and their great
Pilot, their Royal Maſter the beſt read
Student in the Arts of Empire, that poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ever graced a Throne, equally knows
to be his only courſe, and undoubtedly
as ſacredly reſolves to make it ſo. And
if the Judges of the Land ſuppoſe of the
<hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion (beſides their Oaths that
bind 'em, and His Majeſties Honour that
ſhall influence them to it) have theſe Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
more and above even of Intereſt to
their very Religion it ſelf, to move in ſo
regular a Sphere of Juſtice, where lies our
Danger? And if this higher ſtation will be
ſo inoffenſive, What can the poorer Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Peace, or the inferiour Submi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of the Government ſignifie, in
<hi>Popiſh</hi> or not <hi>Popiſh</hi> hands?</p>
            <p>But in this Caſe I have heard ſome
people ſay; Alas, What ſtretch of the

for inſtance, pick a hole in the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by-Lands,</hi>
and ſtart ſome dormient Title or
other to revert them to the Church of
<hi>Rome;</hi> a Patrimony that will not a little
enrich the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and advance their
Cauſe.</p>
            <p>This idle Objection was ſcarce worth
naming; as if the ſtretching of our Laws
in that point was not as notorious and
arbitrary as a total violation of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Right, and rending the whole Frame
of the Laws in ſunder. But to check this
idle ſurmiſe, if a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Parliament it ſelf
in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> with the
very Reſtauration of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion
and Papal Supremacy into the Saddle,
never ſo much as attempted to revert
thoſe Lands: Nay, on the contrary, their
whole Title was confirmed to the preſent
Poſſeſſors, by a Decretal from <hi>Rome</hi> it
ſelf, as was then ſo ſolemnly done by
Cardinal <hi>Poole,</hi> the then Pope's Legate:
How groundleſs muſt the fear be of any
thought or attempt of reverting them
now? Or, Why muſt the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Judges
in any kind ſubvert or undermine the
Laws, contrary to all their beſt Politicks,
in the preſent ſtate of <hi>England,</hi> to no true
advantage either to themſelves or their
Church, and poſſibly to be anſwerable for
it with their Heads, if they live to the

were Priviledges thought too large for a
KING; and therefore He is ſtinted,
and bounded to ſuch Elections, as the
more Imperial Wiſdom of His then great
Counſellors in Parliament judged fitteſt
for Him.</p>
            <p>Monarchical Rule is ſaid to be like
that of Heaven, where the <hi>Primum Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile</hi>
acts altogether by inferiour Spheres,
and Second Cauſes. And ſo Majeſty,
by its Officers and Miniſters, as ſo many
Vehicles, by which the Influences of the
Royal Power are conveyed. But truly
this Aſcendency the Late Law makers
judged too Great for the King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
and therefore they found an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to render the Monarchy little more
than precarious, making the whole Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the State the Creatures of the
Teſt, and not of the KING. Now, I
deſire to know, how in reaſon we can
imagine, That a KING in Himſelf the
<hi>Fountain of Honour,</hi> and <hi>Original of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,</hi>
though in His Nature the mildeſt
and beſt temper'd of Princes; though
without the leaſt thought of Unhinging
the Frame of the Government, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing
the Settled Church of His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to blaſt His Own Glory, and loſe
His Subjects Hearts; (for that would be
all the Crop 'twould yield Him,) I
wonder, I ſay, how we can imagine, that
the Beſt and moſt Gracious of Princes,
though without the forementioned De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
could nevertheleſs brook ſo Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>princely
a Yoke, as the Teſt. And truly
to juſtifie His Majeſties heartieſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
againſt both Penal Laws and Teſt,
in not labouring to Abrogate the firſt,
as they ſtand in force againſt the Lives
and Liberties, (and how unjuſtly has
been proved before) of the Members
of his own Communion, he would be the
moſt unnatural of men: and in not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
to repeal the laſt, as ſtanding ſo
egregiouſly in force againſt the Right
and Prerogative of His Crown, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
originally forged in affront to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he ſhould be the moſt diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Princes: Nor will it ſerve to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
That His late Majeſty (whatever
Diminution to the Prerogative it might
be) by paſſing it into a Law, has al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
that Power from the CROWN.
For, to anſwer that Argument, we are
