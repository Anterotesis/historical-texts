            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of His Majesties Treasury.</head>
            <opener>May it please your Lordships,</opener>
            <p>IN Obedience to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Command, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to inform my self of divers Matters which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Gold and Silver Moneys, and of the most Practicable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods for New Coining the Latter, and Supplying, in the mean time, sufficient Coins to pay the Kings Taxes and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and to carry on the Publick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; and I do humbly represent to your Lordships,</p>
            <p>That I have made diligent Search into several Records, Books and Writings, to see what Acts or Things have been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done or practised, which might serve for Precedents, or give any Light for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establishment of the Coins that should
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107149:3"/>
now go, and have Course as the Lawful Money of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>It is true (as I find in a Book of great Authority, remaining in the Exchequer, called <hi>The Black Book,</hi> written by <hi>Gervase</hi> of <hi>Tilbury,</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond) that there were anciently Falsifiers and Clippers of Money; for when King <hi>William</hi> the First, for the better pay of his Warriours, caused the <hi>Firmes,</hi> which till his time, had for the most part been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered in Victuals, to be converted in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniam Numeratam,</hi> he directed the whole from every County to be Charged on the Sheriff, to be by him brought into the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer; adding, That the Sheriff should make the Payment, <hi>ad Scalam, hoc est</hi> (as the aforesaid Author expounds it) <hi>solveret preter quamlibet numeratam libram sex dena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rios</hi>; and the Money afterwards declining, and becoming worse, it was Ordained, That the <hi>Firmes</hi> of Manors should not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be paid <hi>ad Scalam,</hi> but also <hi>ad Pensam,</hi> which latter was the paying as much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for a Pound <hi>Sterling,</hi> as weighed Twelve Ounces <hi>Troy</hi>; so that Payment of a Pound <hi>de Numero</hi> imported Twenty
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107149:3"/>
Shillings, <hi>ad Scalam</hi> imported Twenty Shillings Six Pence, and <hi>ad Pensam</hi> import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so much as weighed Twelve Ounces. And in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, when the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> was Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, who considered, that though the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney did Answer <hi>Numero &amp; Pondere,</hi> it might nevertheless be mixt with Copper or Brass; therefore (<hi>Consilio Regis &amp; ut Regiae simul &amp; Publicae Provideretur Vtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati</hi>) a Constitution was made, called the <hi>Trial by Combustion.</hi> The whole Progress whereof, as it was practised in the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer in those Days, is exactly set down in the said Book, and differs little or nothing from the present method of <hi>Assaying</hi> Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for its Fineness; as plainly appears in that place where the said <hi>Gervase</hi> treats of the Office of the <hi>Miles Argentarius,</hi> and that of the <hi>Fusor,</hi> an Extract whereof is hereunto Annexed.</p>
            <p>It appears also that the Crown Rents were many times reserved in <hi>Libris Albis</hi> or <hi>Blanch Firmes</hi>; in which case the Payer was holden <hi>Dealbare Firmam,</hi> that is, His Base Money or Coin worse than Standard was Molten down in the Exchequer, and Reduced to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107149:4"/>
the Fineness of Standard Silver, or (instead thereof) he Paid to the King Twelve Pence to the Pound by way of Addition.</p>
            <p>But the most Remarkable Deceipts and Corruptions found in Ancient Records to have been committed upon the Coins of the Kingdom, by Offenders, were in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the First, when there was Imported a sort of Light Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney made with a Mitre; another sort of Light Money with Lyons upon it; a Third sort of Copper Blancht, to Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Money of <hi>England</hi>; a Fourth sort of Light Money Resembling that of King <hi>Edward</hi>; a Fifth kind that was Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And the Crime of Rounding Money (which I take to be the same with Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping) was then in Fashion, all which was done out of <hi>England.</hi> And the Merchants to avoid the Search at <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> concealed the Parcels in Bails of Cloth, and brought them in by other Ports. <hi>Les queux choses si elles suissent longent so efferts</hi> (says the Book) <hi>elles mettere yent la Monye D'englitere a nient:</hi> And the Chief Remedies then Applied were,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:107149:4"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> To Cry down all Money that was not of <hi>England, Ireland</hi> or <hi>Scotland:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That such as arrived from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Seas, should shew the Money they brought with them to the King's Officers:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And not hide it in Fardels, upon Pain of Forfeiture:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Light Money and the Clipt Money might be Bored through without contradiction:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> And that the same should be Received and Paid by Weight at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rate; and that the Persons having such Clipt or Light Money, should bring the same to the King's Changers, who were settled in several great Towns in the Kingdom, to be new Coined. And by what I have Read in <hi>Libro Rubeo</hi> (which is in the upper Exchequer) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Changers (who, as well as the Masters of the Mint, had several Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices Erected in divers Parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; Namely, at <hi>London, Canterbury, Bristol, Kingston</hi> upon <hi>Hull, Newcastle</hi> and <hi>Exeter</hi>) a Principal Business of these Changers was to Buy in the Silver of the Bad Money; <hi>que les Pollards &amp; Crockards
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107149:5"/>
&amp; les autres Mauvaises Moneis Contrefaits Soront, abatues:</hi> And there was a Writ then directed to the Sheriffs, to Prohibit the Importation of Clipt or Counterfeit Moneys, and the Use thereof in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing or Negotiating, under severe Penalties, and Commanding those that had such Money to Bore it through, and to bring it to the King's Change to be new Coined.</p>
            <p>And I find by an Indenture in the Third Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (at which time there was Base Moneys that had been Coined by Publick Authority.) That it was Ordained that <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Treasurer for the Upper Houses of the Mint in the Tower, should take in by Number and Tale, the Base Moneys there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mentioned, at such Rates or Values as were Appointed by a Proclamation in that behalf; giving Bills to the Parties under his Hand for the Receipt thereof. And the Officers of the Mint were to Melt down and Repay the same in Sterling Moneys, to the Parties or their Deputies, shewing and delivering their Bills, having regard to the time when every Man brought in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107149:5"/>
his Money. And the Base Money Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the Sterling Money Repaid were to be Entred in Two Legers; one to be kept by the said Under-Treasurer, and the other by the Tellers. And the Comptroller and Assay-Master were to keep several Books of Refining and Melting the Base Money, to the intent they might be Vouchers to the said Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Treasurer, who was to Account to the Queen for the whole.</p>
            <p>These or such like Provisions might serve well enough in those Times, when there was not much Money, and but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Trade or Occasion for it, and when the <hi>Species</hi> then in being, which one would think consisted Anciently of Pence or Pieces of small Denomination, were not Corrupted or Diminished to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as they are at this day.</p>
            <p>But considering the present low Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to which Our Moneys are almost generally Reduced, and the necessary Use thereof in daily Occasions, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the ways of Trade, upon which this Nation depends more at this time than it did formerly; I do not see
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107149:6"/>
how the Prudence of our Ancestors (which in many Constitutions relating to the Exchequer and the Mint, appears to have been Transcendent and Admirable, especially in Matters of Charge and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, and preventing Frauds and Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses upon the Crown) can, without the devising new or additional Means and Methods, be made Applicable to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Work of new Coining the Silver Moneys, and Supplying Currant Coins for the Commerce, and for the Payment of Taxes and Revenues in the mean time.</p>
            <p>If therefore the King (to whose Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality the Power of Coining Money, and Determining the Weight, Fineness, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination and Extrinsick Value there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doth Solely and Inherently Apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) shall Judge it necessary to have the old or present <hi>Species</hi> of Silver Coins, or so much thereof as hath been Clipt or otherwise Dimnished, to be Melted down and Recoined, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive new Means and Methods for doing the same must be Devised. And in Regard Money (which some Lawyers
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107149:6"/>
have called <hi>Firmamentum Belli &amp; Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum Pacis</hi>) is most certainly of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Importance to His Majesty, in supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Taxes, Revenues and Loans, for Carrying on the War, and Supporting His Royal Estate; as also to His Subjects, with relation not only to their Trade and Commerce, but also to all other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Means of Livelihood: The said Means and Methods for Re-establishing the Coins, and the many weighty things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending thereupon, ought to be well Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitated, and to be Considered and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justed by Persons of the greatest Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Sagacity; and (if I had not been Enjoyned by your Lordships) I should scarce have Adventured upon a Subject so very Difficult and Curious.</p>
            <p>I have Imployed my Thoughts chiefly upon such Matters as are Reduceable to the following Heads, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>First, <hi>Concerning the Standard of the Gold and Silver Coins, and the Establishment of a

Iust and Reasonable Foot for the Course of the same.</hi>
                  </item>

                  </item>
                  <item>Third, <hi>Whether it be or be not Absolutely necessary at this Time to Re-establish the same.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Fourth, <hi>The Proposing of Means that must be Obtained, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Methods to be used in and for the Amendment of the Silver Moneys.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Fifth, <hi>To Consider what must Supply the Commerce, Pay Taxes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Whilst the Clipt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107149:7"/>
Money is under its New Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Particulars.</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>First, <hi>Of the Standard.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>This properly brings under Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Two matters relating to the Coins; namely, the Degree of Fineness, and the Weight of the Pieces. In treating upon which I shall humbly take leave to observe this Method.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> To explain what is meant by <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> Moneys.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To set down Historically the Proportions of Fine Gold, and Fine Silver, with the respective Allays, which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters or Workers of the Mints have been holden to Observe in the Fabrication of the Moneys of this Realm, by their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Indentures which I have found out, Beginning with those in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, (the farthest Extant) and Ending with the Indenture of the Mint now in being.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To propose the Standard of Fineness, which (in my humble Opinion) ought to be continued for the new Coins, which His Majesty may be pleased to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect at this time, with my Reasons for the same, to be deduced from the Experience of former times, and an Impartial regard to present Circumstances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To set forth how the Value of the Gold and Silver in our <hi>English</hi> Coins hath been Raised from time to time, which considers the Weight and Number of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in a Pound <hi>Troy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To Offer my humble Opinion upon that Subject, in reference as well to the Old Coins now in being and Unclipt, as also to the New Moneys, which may be directed to be made, as aforesaid, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with my Reasons for the same, to be also Grounded upon the Experience of former Times, and a due Consideration of present Circumstances: All or most of which Points being of great Moment, to be well weighed in this Affair, I do humbly pray your Lordships that I may Discuss them severally.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:107149:8"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It is believed by some Authors, (and not without Reason) that in the most Ancient times, when Money was first Coined within this Island, it was made of <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Hales <hi>of Sheriffs Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. p. 5.</hi>
                  </note> Pure Gold and Silver, like the Moneys now Currant in some other Nations, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Barbary,</hi> where they have Pieces of Gold called <hi>Ducats</hi> and <hi>Sultanesses</hi>; and in the Kingdom of <hi>Industan,</hi> where they have Pieces of Silver called <hi>Rupees,</hi> which I have seen, and wherein (as I am inform'd) there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no Allay: And that afterwards it being found convenient in the Fabrication of the Moneys, to have a certain Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Proportion of Baser Metal to be mixt with the Pure Gold and Silver, the Word <hi>Sterling</hi> was introduced, and hath ever since been used, to denote the certain Proportion or Degree of Fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which ought to be retained in the respective Coins composed of such mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as aforesaid. There are some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that fancy this Word <hi>Sterling</hi> took its Name from a Castle in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as if it were first Coined there. Some have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107149:9"/>
derived it from a Star or Astracism, which they imagine to have been Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thereupon. There are those that fetch it from the Name of an Ancient Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Bond which was taken by the Jews (those old Userers) for Security of their Debts, and which was called the <hi>Iews Star.</hi> But others think it comes from the Name of a People called <hi>Easterlings,</hi> as the first Workers of it in <hi>England.</hi> Of which latter Opinion is the Author of a very old Treatise concerning Money, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred at large in the <hi>Red Book</hi> abovesaid, in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third. For my own Part, I do not believe the Word <hi>Sterling</hi> (denoting the degree of Fineness or Goodness, as aforesaid) was known in the time of the Conqueror, in regard there is no mention thereof in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro Iudiciario</hi> or the <hi>Dooms-day Book,</hi> which Valueth every Manor (as it was worth in the times of the Confessor and Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror respectively) in Money <hi>ad Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> or <hi>ad Pensam</hi> or <hi>ad Pondus,</hi> but not in <hi>Sterling</hi> Money, and yet the Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Sterling</hi> was soon after introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, because the Statute of the Twenty
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107149:9"/>
fifth of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third refers to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Sterling,</hi> and so do the Old Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Mint, and the Ancient En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries concerning Money. By reading of which it seems evident to me,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That a <hi>Sterling</hi> or <hi>Easterling,</hi> in a restrained Sence, signified nothing but a Silver Peny, which at first was about three times as heavy as a Peny is now, and was once called a <hi>Lundress,</hi> because it was to be Coined only at <hi>London,</hi> and not at the Countrey Mints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Words <hi>Sterling</hi> and <hi>Standard</hi> are Synonimous Terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the <hi>Ancient Sterling of</hi> England, mentioned in the said Statute, and the Standard and Allay of Old <hi>Easter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> mentioned in the Indenture, <hi>Le</hi> 20 <hi>jour de</hi> May <hi>l' an du Regne</hi> Edward <hi>III. cestassavoir d</hi>' Engletere <hi>quarant sisme &amp; de</hi> France <hi>trent tierce entre le Roy &amp;</hi> Bardet <hi>de</hi> Malepilys <hi>de</hi> Florence; and the <hi>Old right Standard of</hi> England, which I find in other Indentures of the Mint, are to be understood thus: A Pound Weight <hi>Troy</hi> of Gold was divided into Twenty four Carats, and every Carat into Four Grains
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107149:10"/>
of Gold; and a Pound Weight of the <hi>Old Sterling,</hi> or <hi>Right Standard Gold of</hi> England, consisted of Twenty three Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats and Three Grains and an half of Fine Gold, and half a Grain of Allay. Which Allay (as the <hi>Red Book</hi> says) might be Silver or Copper. Again, a Pound Weight <hi>Troy</hi> of Silver, was then (as it has been ever since) divided into Twelve Ounces, every Ounce into Twenty Peny Weight, and every Peny Weight into Twenty four Grains; every Grain of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was called a Subtile Grain, Sixty of which were equal to One Grain of Gold, and a Pound Weight of <hi>Old Sterling,</hi> or <hi>Right Standard Silver of</hi> England, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then (as it does now) of Eleven Ounces and Two Peny Weight of Fine Silver, and Eighteen Peny Weight Allay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That <hi>Sterling</hi> Money gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in Judgment of Law, upon the Fines, Covenants, and other Instruments that have had occasion to refer thereunto, hath always imported, and doth still im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port only such Coins of Gold or Silver, as have been made by successive Masters
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107149:10"/>
and Workers of the Mint, in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Proportions of Fine Metal, mixt with Allays, according to their respective Indentures or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants with the Crown, from time to time, and made Currant by the same Indentures, or by Proclamations or Commands of the Sovereign: Which Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Fineness and Allay, have differed from time to time. And (having thus Expounded what is meant by <hi>Sterling</hi> and <hi>Old Sterling</hi>) those Differences will come properly to be Considered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second,</hi> In the next Place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I am to set down Historically the Proportions of Fine Gold and Fine Silver, with the respective Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, which the Masters or Workers of the Mint have been holden to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in the Fabrication of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, by their respective Indentures: Of which there is one mentioned in the <hi>Red Book,</hi> to bear Date in the Eighteenth Year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the First, who sent for Workmen
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107149:11"/>
from beyond Sea, to inform him of the manner of Making and Forging of Money; but not finding any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture by which one can judge certainly of the said Proportions, till the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third; from whose time the several Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Mint, or most of them, are in the Receipt of the Exchequer, in Custody of your Lordships and the Chamberlains there, and where I have had the Opportunity carefully to Inspect and Examine the same. I shall therefore humbly take leave to begin with these, and Proceed in the Order following.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That above Four hundred Years ago, the Standard for the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Coins was Eleven Ounces Two Peny Weight Fine, and Eighteen Peny Weight Allay. And so it is at
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107149:15"/>
this day by the present Indenture of the Mint, and the same is that which was called the <hi>Old Sterling,</hi> or <hi>Easterling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Standard for the Gold Coins Four hundred Years ago, was Twenty three Carats Three Grains and an half Fine, and half a Grain Allay. And at this day the Standard of Gold by the Indenture of the Mint is Twenty two Carats Fine, and Two Carats Allay; the difference of which is only One Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Three Grains and an half.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the <hi>Old Standard</hi> obtained for the most part of the said Number of Years, and the chief Deviations from the same were in the Reigns of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth.</p>
               <p>The which being premised, the Third thing coming under Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration concerning such new Coins as His Majesty shall think fit to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, is my own poor Opinion, which I humbly offer, and (as I conceive) with some clearness, <hi>That
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107149:15"/>
the present Standard of Fineness, or Purity ought to be continued, namely, of Twenty two Carats Fine, and Two Carats Allay for the Gold; and Eleven Ounces Two Peny Weight Fine, and Eighteen Peny Weight Allay for the Silver, in all the New Coins that shall be now directed.</hi> And my Reasons for the same are as follows,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because our Ancestors (whose wisdom we have no cause to distrust) have for many Ages endeavoured to keep up the <hi>Old Sterling,</hi> or to a Standard very near it; which obtained (as evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the foregoing Narrative) for the greatest part of Four hundred years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Although the former Debase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Coins by Publick Authority, especially those in the Reigns of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, might be projected for the Profit of the Crown; and the Projectors might mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that Profit by the excessive Quantities of Allay that were mixt with the Silver or the Gold: And although this was Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by a Prince who could stretch his Prerogative very far upon his People; and was done in Times when this Nation had
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107149:16"/>
very little Commerce, Inland or Foreign, to be injured or prejudiced thereby: Yet Experience presently shewed that the Projectors were mistaken, and that it was absolutely necessary to have the base Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys reformed; the doing whereof was begun by King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth himself, carried on by King <hi>Philip</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and happily finished (though not without great Charge, Vexation and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the only Offspring of such Designs) by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who (as is noted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove) in the Third Year of her Reign, when Money was not plentiful, Erected a Distinct Mint in the Tower, to convert the Base (not Counterfeit Money) into <hi>Sterling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Because making of Base Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys will Disgrace this Government in future Generations, the Criticks in every Age being apt to Estimate the Goodness or Badness of Ancient Governments by their Coin, as hath been done, especially in the Case of the <hi>Romans</hi>; and a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this kind ought not to be left for future Ages, to the prejudice of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the present King.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:107149:16"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Although it must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, That the putting a greater Allay into the Coins, so long as they should still retain so much Purity or Fineness as would render them answerable to the Currant Price of Silver in Bullion, would be no real Injury to the Subject: Yet it must be considered, that when the Causes which at present make Silver Scarce and Dear shall cease, Silver it self will fall in its Price. And if in the mean time the Coins shall have been Debased, then after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieving of the Trade and Wealth of the Nation, and the Bringing down of the Price of Silver thereby, the Damage which the Crown will sustain in its Taxes, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues and Loans, and the Loss which the Nobility, Gentry and Commonalty (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Ecclesiastical Persons) will find thereby, in the payment of their Debts, Rents and Annuities (many of which are so Fixt and Establisht upon previous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations or Grants in Fee, or in Tail, or for Lives, or Years certain, or are so pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by Assurances, already perfected, as that it will not be in their powers to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same proportionably to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basement
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107149:17"/>
of the Coin, and the loss or da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, after such Bringing down the Price of Silver, will be proportionable to the excessive Allay to be put into the Money) will continue and have duration at least till all such Base Money can be abated: The meer Reforming of which would take up a considerable time, and be a new trouble and difficulty after the Ending of the present War, and after the Re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of the Trade and Wealth of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Our present Standard is well known in the World, the same agreeing with most of the Foreign Mints in <hi>Europe,</hi> and all Foreigners that deal with us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Intrinsick Value more than the Extrinsick Denomination, and Exchange with us accordingly. If Base Money should be made, the Intrinsick Value thereof would be uncertain, or might be disputed; and in Disputes of such a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is more likely that they will gain upon us, than we upon them, and so the Exchange become more to our prejudice than it is at present.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:107149:17"/>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Debasing of Money by Publick Authority is needless and frivolous; for whatsoever Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages (grounded upon necessity) can be propos'd thereby, will arise more easily, and have better Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in Raising the Value of the <hi>Standard</hi>; which is the next Subject to be Discussed: Not doubting but that your Lordships by these, and other Reasons which might be given (if they were not too tedious) will be fully convinc'd, That <hi>the present Standard</hi> of Fineness is to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued.</p>
               <p>The Fourth thing which I have undertaken, in respect of the <hi>Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> is to set forth how the Value of the Gold and Silver in the <hi>English Coins</hi> hath been Rais'd from time to time, which considers the Weight and Number of the Pieces in the Pound <hi>Troy.</hi> And because (in case of new making Silver Moneys) the Adjusting and Establishing the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick Value or Denomination</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, at which the same must have
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107149:18"/>
Course, is of the greatest Moment and Consideration in this Affair, both to the King and all his People; I could not spare my self the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of making the following Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the Indentures of the Mint; which being duly meditated upon, will give a good deal of Light and Precedent for the Rates, to which the Value of Gold and Silver in our Coins are to be Raised and Established at this time.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1 W &amp; M.</note>The like.</p>
                  <p>By the careful observing of which Deduction here made, from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentures of the Mint for above Four hundred Years past (many of which are yet extant, and have been seen and examined by me) it doth evidently appear, That it has been a Policy constantly Practised in the Mints of <hi>England</hi> (the like ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving indeed been done in all Foreign Mints belonging to other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) to Raise the Value of the Coin in its Extrinsick Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from time to time, as any Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or Occasion required; and more especially to Encourage the bringing of Bullion into the Realm to be Coined (though sometimes, when the desired End was obtained, the Value has been suffered to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.)
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107149:29"/>
So that in the whole Number of Years, from the Twenty eighth of <hi>Edward</hi> the First, until this time, by such Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Extrinsick Value or Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Silver is Raised in about a Triple Proportion; that is to say, In the Reign of the said King <hi>Edward</hi> the First (as is plain by this Narrative) a Pound Weight <hi>Troy</hi> of <hi>Sterling</hi> Silver was shorn at Twenty Shillings and Three Pence, and consequently Two hundred fourty three Pence, or Twenty Shillings and One Fourth of a Shilling, or One Pound and One Eightieth Part of a Pound by Tale, were then Coin'd, out of the said Pound Weight <hi>Troy</hi>: Whereas at this day, and for about Ninety years past, a Pound Weight <hi>Troy</hi> of like Silver, is and hath been Coin'd into Seven hundred fourty four Pence, or Sixty two Shillings, or Three Pounds, and One tenth of a Pound by Tale, the Pound Weight <hi>Troy</hi> having then and now the same Weight and Fineness. And as to the Gold, I need only to observe from the foregoing Deduction, That in the Eighteenth of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the First, a Pound Weight Fine,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107149:30"/>
Twenty three Carats, Three Grains and one Half, was Coin'd into Fifteen Pounds by Tale: Whereas at this day a Pound Weight of Gold, of the Fineness only of Twenty two Carats, is Coin'd into Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four Pounds Ten Shillings. And this Method of Raising the Extrinsick Value of the Gold and Silver, in the Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Coins, as it hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant almost in the Reign of every King, so no Inconvenience, Disgrace or Mischief (as can be observed) has ever accrued by the doing thereof at any time, when a Just, Necessary or Reasonable Cause gave Occasion thereunto.</p>
                  <p>The which being Premised, and every Project for Debasing the Money (by the Reason before given) being Rejected as Dangerous, Dishonourable and Needless: It remains that our Nation in its present Exigence, may avail it self, by <hi>Raising</hi> the Value of its Coins, and this may be effected, either by making the respective Pieces called Crowns, Half-Crowns, Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be lesser in Weight, or by continuing the same Weight or Bigness, which is at present in the Unclipt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107149:30"/>
and Ordaining at the same time, that every such Piece shall be Currant at a higher Price in Tale.</p>
                  <p>But before I proceed to give my Opinion upon this Subject, it seems necessary for me to assert and prove an <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> which is this, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That making the Pieces less, or ordaining the respective Pieces (of the present Weight) to be Currant at a higher Rate, may equally raise the Value of the Silver in our Coins.</hi> The former of these finds many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents in the Indentures above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, but the latter seems more suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our present Circumstances, as will afterwards be shewed more at large.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Hypothesis</hi> or <hi>Theorem</hi> is easily demonstrated thus, Let it be granted, That a Crown Piece by the <hi>present Standard</hi> contains in <hi>Sterling Silver</hi> (as it really doth) Nineteen Peny Weight, and 354838/1000000 parts of a Peny Weight: Or (which is the same thing) Nineteen peny Weight Eight Grains and an Half, and a very small
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107149:31"/>
fractional part more, going at this time for Five Shillings, or Sixty Pence. And let it be supposed (which is practicable, and the thing aimed at) that this very Crown Piece be ordained to pass for Six Shillings and Three Pence, or (which is equal) Seventy five Pence. Then I say by Inverse Proportion, as Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty five Pence are to Sixty Pence, so Sixty will be to Fourty eight Pence, which are equal to Four Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. From whence I infer, That if the Extrinsick Value of the Silver now in a Crown were to be Rais'd to Six Shillings and Three Pence (by diminishing the Weight of the Piece according to former Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents) then such Diminitive Crown must weight only Four fifths of the said 19.354838/1000000 Peny Weight, that is to say, it must weigh Fifteen Peny Weight, and 4833704/10000000 parts of a Peny Weight, and in this case Five Three Pences to be Coin'd in the same Proportion, to compleat the Rais'd Value of Six Shillings and Three
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107149:31"/>
Pence, must weigh One fourth part of the Diminitive Crown, as in the Margin.<note place="margin">
                        <figure/>
                     </note> Again (by direct Proportion) if 15.4838704 Peny Weight of <hi>Sterling Silver</hi> is to go or be Currant for Five Shillings, of Sixty Pence, then 19.354838 Peny Weight of <hi>Sterling Silver</hi> (which is the Quantity in an Unclipt Crown by the <hi>present Standard,</hi> and equal to the Sum or Aggregate of the other Two Quantities) ought to go and be Currant for Six Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Three Pence, or Seventy five Pence, and consequently will Raise the Extrinsick Value of the Silver, as much as diminishing the Pieces would do; which was to be demonstrated.</p>
                  <p>And now (having cleared my way) I humbly take leave to offer my Opinion, <hi>That all such Silver Moneys as are after E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerated of the Lawful Coins of this Realm of</hi> England,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Memorandum,</hi> Moneys Clipt or Unclipt, are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by certain Weights.</note> 
                     <hi>which are now in being, and are not at all diminished by Clipping, Roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Filing, Washing, or any other Artifice, be Rais'd by Publick Authority to the foot of Six shillings
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107149:32"/>
and Three pence for the Crown, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably for the other</hi> Species, <hi>namely, the Crown to go for Seventy five pence, the Half-Crown to go for Thirty seven pence and an half-peny, the Shilling for Fifteen pence, and the Half-shilling for Seven pence half-peny, leaving all the other old Vnclipt Pieces, as the Thirteen pence half-peny, the Nine pence, the Groat, Two pence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which are very few in Number, and much worn, to go upon their present Foot, and to find their Values in pence, and parts of a peny, as they do at this day.

                     <hi>First,</hi> The Value of the Silver in the Coin ought to be Raised to the Foot of Six Shillings Three Pence in every Crown, because the Price of Standard Silver in Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion is Risen (from divers necessary and unnecessary Causes, producing at great length a great scarcity thereof in <hi>England</hi>) to Six Shilings Five Pence an Ounce: This Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (which I humbly conceive will appear irrefragable) is grounded chiefly upon a Truth so Apparent, that it may well be compared to an Axiom even in Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Reasoning, to wit, <hi>That when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the Extrinsick Value of Silver in the Coin hath been, or shall be less than the price of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in Bullion, the Coin hath been, and will be Melted down.</hi> Although the melting down of Coin, for private Lucre, be done in secret (because 'tis Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable by <note n="*" place="margin">9 F.3 &amp; 17 R.2. <hi>Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited Goldsmiths and others to Melt down small Coins, under pain of forfeiture of the Molten Silver.</hi> 14. Car.2. <hi>Prohibited the Melting any the Silver Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, under pain of Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Same, and double the Value; if by a Freeman, he is to be Disfranchised; and if not a Freeman, he is to be Imprisoned Six Months.</hi> 6 &amp; 7 W. &amp; M <hi>makes the Conviction of Melters more Practicable, and inflicts Six Months Imprisonment for the Offence.</hi>
                     </note>Law) yet no man can doubt but that it has been Practised for a long time past, to such a Degree, upon the <pb n="69" facs="tcp:107149:35"/>Weighty Money, as that in particular, the Crowns and Half-Crowns of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> are quite vanished: Those of King <hi>James</hi> the First are become very rare: Those of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First (though the most nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous of all that remain) are in great measure Reduced, and will appear to be so the more plainly, when they come to be distinguished from the Counterfeits, which are mostly contrived to Resemble these: The Crowns, Half-Crowns, and indeed the lesser Coins of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second (the far greatest part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were Milled Money) in all Payments at the Exchequer, and other Publick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, do not, by Estimation, exceed the Proportion of Ten Shillings <hi>per Cent.</hi> or a Two hundredth Part. And if this Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fact of Melting down has been notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously Committed, at times when there was no great difference betwen the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the Silver in the Coin and that in the Bullion; or when the Goldsmiths and other Artificers could make no other Profit thereby, than the finall Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weight, which (by Weighing and Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107149:36"/>the Pieces Coin'd at the Tower) they found to be in some of them, which being Molten, might be carried back to the Mint, and there Re-coin'd at the King's Charge into a greater number by Tale for their own Use: Then one may easily conclude, That the temptation of Melting down, is grown of late much more prevalent; since, at this day, Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard Silver in Bullion is commonly sold at the said Price of Six Shillings and Five Pence, or for Seventy seven Pence an Ounce. And in regard Twenty Peny Weight (equal to an Ounce) bears the same Proportion to Seventy seven Pence as Nineteen Peny Weight, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                     </gap>8/100 000 of One Peny Weight (equal to the Standard Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver contained in a Crown Piece) doth to Six Shillings and Two Pence Half-peny; it is most plain, that he now Melts down (for Instance) a Crown Piece, which whilst it retains the Image and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perscription of His Majesty, or either of the late King's runs only for Five Shillings, can immediately sell the Silver of it here for Six Shillings and Two Pence Half-peny, and gain the Sum of Fourteen<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107149:36"/>Pence Half-Peny upon every such Melted Piece, By such Sale of the Silver here, or (by reason of the great Loss which this Nation at present suffers in its Foreign Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change or Remittances) he may make a greater Profit of the same Silver , by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting it into Foreign Parts, if he can effect the same, either by Stealth, or by Eluding the late Act of Parliament, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting such Exportation. One may also foresee, that continuing the Silver Moneys (either Old or New Coins) upon the present foot, whilst Bullion is so much dearer, will inevitably produce Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences pernicious to the whole; in effect it will be nothing else but the furnishing Offenders with a <hi>Species</hi> to Melt down at an extravagant Profit, and encouraging not a necessary, but a violent and exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Exportation of our Silver to the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Parts, for the sake of the Gain only, till we shall have little or none left in the Kingdom. And upon an Impartial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of these Matters, we may be able to make a more mature Judgment upon the Suggestion that has been raised by some Men, Namely, That Raising the<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107149:37"/> Value of our Coin, or Continuing it on the present Foot will be the same thing. If these Gentlemen mean, that Silver in Bullion will always, during this War, be dearer than Silver in Coin, because of the necessity to Export it for the Foreign Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the War, and to answer the Ballance of Trade, occasioned by the Interruption of our Navigation, I Answer,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That this Necessity may be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished; but it cannot in any Sence be Augmented, by Raising the Value of our Coin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That supposing the worst, to wit, a further Advance of the Silver in Bullion, yet even in that case, the Offenders before mentioned will not find so much Incouragement or Temptation, when their Profit, whatsoever it be, upon every Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Crown, must evidently be less by Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Pence Half-peny than it is at present, upon a Crown running in Payment for Five Shillings only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is hoped that the Exchange to <hi>Holland,</hi> (which by the way has risen a little of late) may by the Success of some
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107149:37"/>
good Designs now on Foot (though the War should continue) be kept at a stand, at least from falling much lower. In which Case I think the Arguments of these Gentlemen will have little or no Weight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There must be a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with regard to the Service and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service of the Publick, between a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Exportation of Bullion or Coin, (perhaps the One may be as well Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensed with as the other, by Publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and to a Limited Sum; only for the Service of the War) and such an Exportation thereof, as proceeds Original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the said exorbitant Profit of the Melters, who being Goldsmiths, Refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or other Traders, and by this Means, and by the Clippings, getting great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Molten Silver into their Hands, know well enough (though by Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or Indirect Means) to convey the same beyond Sea, either to buy Gold there, which is afterwards brought hither and Coin'd into Guineas, passing at Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Shillings apiece; or to buy Prohibited Goods, as Lace, Lustrings, Muslins, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107149:38"/>
                     <hi>East-India</hi> Goods, or other enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Commodities, or for other Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which, though unlawful or needless, do all help or combine, at this time, to Augment and Inhance that Ballance of Trade between us and our Neighbours, very much to our Detriment, as will be shew'd hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> These Gentlemen consider on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the use of our Coin in <hi>England,</hi> as it hath Relation to Foreign Exchanges or Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, whereas it serves principally the Inland Commerce, and supplies many other occasions, which will be advantaged by the Rise and Plenty thereof. And whereas it is apprehended that the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Advance of the Silver in the Coin, will produce a proportionable loss in all Rents and Revenues, Publick or Private, settled or ascertained by Antecedent Reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, Grants or Agreements, and in all Debts now standing out upon Specialty, or without Specialty: I humbly conceive these Apprehensions must entirely vanish, when it shall be impartially considered, That this Nation is, and hath been for some time past, ingaged in a necessary
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107149:38"/>
War, which hath not only caused a great Expence of our Wealth in Foreign Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> but hath Interrupted the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, which used to Supply us from <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Indies,</hi> and from other Parts of <hi>Asia, Africa</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> with much greater Quantities of Goods than served our own Consumption, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afforded us a large Overplus, which, together with our own Native Product or Manufacture, were Exported to our Neighbour Nations, in Barter or Exchange for the Goods we received of them. That reckoning on the one side the Value of the Naval Stores, Linens, Silks, Salt-Petre, and many other Enumerated Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which we receive from our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and adding thereunto our Foreign Expence for the War: And on the other side the Value of so much of our Native Manufactures, or Produce, and the small Overplus of Goods brought from the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Indies,</hi> &amp;c. as we have lately Exported, or can Export into our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> there would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a great Difference or Excess between the one side and the other of such Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107149:39"/>
or Reckoning; which Difference or Excess is or may be called the <hi>Ballance of Trade.</hi> That it cannot be conceived how this Ballance, Difference, or Excess hath been or can be answered by us in any thing other than our Coin or Bullion. That to answer this <hi>Ballance of Trade,</hi> there hath been already Exported a great part of our Coins and Bullion, namely, Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, which I think must have been equal in Value to at least a Fourth part of our whole <hi>Species</hi> of Silver Moneys, the Molten Silver of a good part of our heavy Coins, part of our heavy Coins themselves, our whole Stock of Foreign Silver, for I am told there is little or none of that to be bought in <hi>England</hi> at this time, and the Molten Silver of a great deal of our <hi>English</hi> Plate and Vessels, which People have been induced to part with at a good Price. That by this means Silver in Coin or in Mass is actually grown very Scarce in <hi>England.</hi> That every thing having any Value or Worth whatsoever, when it becomes Scarce grows Dear, or (which is the same thing) it Riseth in Price, and consequently it will serve to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107149:39"/>
pay more Debt, or it will buy greater Quantities of other Goods of Value, or in any thing else it will go further than it did before. That Silver in <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown Scarce, as aforesaid, is conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently grown Dearer. That it is Risen in Price from Five Shillings and Two Pence, to Six Shillings and Five Pence an Ounce: And by Daily Experience Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Peny Weight and Three Tenths of a Peny Weight in <hi>Sterling Silver</hi> (equal to the Weight of a Crown Piece) in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> doth, and will Purchase more Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Money than Five Shillings by Tale, (though the latter be delivered <hi>bona fide</hi> in Unclipt Shillings, or in a good Bill) and consequently doth and will Purchase and Acquire more Goods or necessaries, or pay more Debts in <hi>England,</hi> or (being delivered here) it fetches more Money in any Foreign Parts by way of Exchange, than Five Shillings by Tale, or the Sixth Part of a Guinea by Tale, or Goods to the Value of Five Shillings in Tale only, do or can Fetch, Purchase or Acquire. That this Advanced Price of the Silver has been growing for some time, and is Originally
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107149:40"/>
caused by the Ballance, Excess or Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence abovementioned, which Naturally and Rationally produces such an effect. And there is no reason to expect that Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will decline in its Price or Value here, till it be made more plentiful, by turning the <hi>Ballance of Trade</hi> to our Advantage, which seems to be a Work that can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished with Success in times of Peace, or by such a Protection of our Trade, as will render our Exportations as large as they used to be in times of Peace. That the Raising the Value of the Silver in our Coins to make it equal to Silver in Mass, can in no Sence be understood to be a cause of making Silver Scarce. That there can never be propos'd any just or reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Foot upon which the Coins should be Currant, save only the very Price of the Silver thereof, in case it be Molten in the same Place where the Coins are made Currant, or an Extrinsick Denomination very near that Price: It being most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That if the Value of the Silver in the Coins should (by any Extrinsick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination) be Raised above the Value, or Market Price of the same Silver, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107149:40"/>
to Bullion, the Subject would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably Injured and Defrauded, as they were formerly in the case of the Base Moneys Coin'd by Publick Authority, but if the Value of the Silver in the Coins be less than the Value or Market Price of the same Silver reduced to Bullion, then the Coins are always Melted down for Luore, as they have been, and are at this day in the Case of the Unclipt Moneys, and as they will certainly be, in Case of any New Coins that shall be made, to be Currant upon the Old Foot of Sixty Pence for the Silver of a Crown Piece; which sufficiently proves, That the <hi>Medium</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd is the true Foundation for the Course of our Moneys. That for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose we need only to consider the very Price that Silver bears in <hi>England,</hi> where these Coins are to be Currant, although if we will have Relation to Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Countreys, particularly to <hi>Holland,</hi> we shall find that the Currant Price of an Ounce of Silver there, adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Difference of Exchange from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Amsterdam</hi> or <hi>Roterdam</hi> (which Difference in the Exchange, is but another
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107149:41"/>
Effect of the <hi>Ballance of Trade</hi> before-mentioned) will still make up the Price of Six Shillings and Five Pence for the Ounce of Silver at <hi>London.</hi> And if this were not so, your Lordships might be sure that no body would buy Silver at <hi>London</hi> for Six Shillings and Five Pence an Ounce, carry it to <hi>Holland,</hi> and sell it there perhaps for Five Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Five Pence an Ounce, or for so much in their Coins, the Silver whereof is not equal to Five Shillings and Five Pence by our Standard. That it ought not to be Alledged that Silver has no Price; for every Indenture of the Mint (having first Ascertain'd the Extrinsick Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Currant Coins) has taken care also to Determine the Price or Value of the Silver to the Merchant or Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which was to be Answered in those Extrinsick Denominations; and daily Experience shews every Man, in Buying or Selling of Silver, that it has a Price or Value still Reckoned in those Extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick Denominations, although at present it much exceeds, as aforesaid, the said Rate of Sixty two Shillings for a Pound
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107149:41"/>
                     <hi>Troy.</hi> That Five Shillings Coin'd upon the Foot hereby Proposed, will actually contain more real and Intrinsick Value of Silver by a great deal, than is in the Currant Moneys now commonly Applied to the Payment of the said Rents, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues and Debts, upon which the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Loss is Apprehended, and in Reason will and ought to go further to all Intents and Purposes, than Five Shillings in Clipt Moneys, or in the Sixth Part of a Guinea, doth or can go; which will be better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, when the Mischiefs of these Clipt Moneys and Guineas come to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd in the Third Chapter. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That as the Foot or Foundation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Proposed, for the Course of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, will be Just and Reasonable, with regard to the Price of Silver, and more Advantagious to the Receivers thereof, than Payment in Clipt Moneys or Gold at the present Price; so every Person that shall Receive any Money Coin'd or made Currant upon this New Foot, will have the Payment, Issuing and Expenditure thereof at the same Rate. And it is freely submitted to Impartial Judgments,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107149:42"/>
whether the propos'd Advance of Silver in the Coins can infer a Real Loss upon any Persons, other than such as can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to themselves particularly the Receipt of Moneys in Weighty or Unclipt Pieces only, and the Conversion thereof to an Advantage, which Law or Reason would not allow them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Value of the Silver in the Coin ought to be Raised, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the bringing of Bullion to the Mint to be Coin'd. It is a Matter of Fact well known to your Lordships, and (by the small Number of the Pieces of the present King, or of His Majesty and the Deceas'd Queen) it is perceivable by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body else, that since Bullion hath born a greater Price than Silver in the Coin, there has been none brought to the Mint to be Coin'd, either by Importers or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, unless some small Parcels, that were Seiz'd or sent thither by Publick Authority. And it is utterly against Reason for any Man to think, that any Bullion of Silver will be carried thither voluntarily to be Coin'd, till the Value of Silver Coin'd be Raised, at least as high as the Value of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107149:42"/>
Silver in Bullion. By the propos'd Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to Six Shillings and Three Pence, the <hi>Sterling</hi> Silver in the Coins will be set at Six Shillings and Five Pence Half-peny <hi>per</hi> Ounce, which will exceed the present Price of <hi>Sterling</hi> in Bullion by One Half-peny <hi>per</hi> Ounce, and give (though by a small Profit) an Encouragement to those that have <hi>English</hi> Silver or Plate, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the Retailers of Wine, Beer, Ale and other Liquors, (whose Tank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards and other Vessels are herein after Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be brought in) and generally to all those that have or can have Silver Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, to carry the same to the Mint to be Coin'd. And this will be agreeable to the Policy that in past Ages (as hath been observed upon the aforesaid Deduction) hath been Practised not only in our Mint, but in the Mints of all Politick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, namely, to Raise the Value of Silver in the Coin, to Promote the Work of the Mint.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Raising the Value of the Silver in the Coin, will increase the whole <hi>Species</hi> in Tale, and thereby make it more commensurate to the general need
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107149:43"/>
thereof, for carrying on the Common Traffick and Commerce of the Nation, and to answer the Payments on the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Contracts, Securities, and other daily Occasions, requiring a larger Supply of Money for that purpose. This Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may be farther Illustrated, by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the want of a sufficient Stock of Money, hath been the chief Cause of Introducing so much Paper Credit (which is at best hazardous, and may be carried too far) and the Setting up of Offices, both in City and Country, for Bartering of Goods or Permutations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Silver in the Old Unclipt Moneys, and in the New Coins now Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be made, ought to be Raised (as I have offered) <hi>Equally,</hi> to avoid Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Uncertainty in Payments: For if Pieces, having the same Bigness, should have different Values, it might be difficult for the Common People (especially those not skilled in Arithmetick) to Compute how many of one kind will be equal to the Sum of another; and there might be some Dispute about the Lawful Money of <hi>England,</hi> to be Paid upon Mortgages,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107149:43"/>
Bonds, Contracts, or other Legal Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties referring thereunto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Foot of Six Shillings and Three Pence for the Crown, here Propos'd, will not only be suitable to the present Rate of Bullion, but it happens to be such a Sum as is Deviseable into a great Number of <hi>Aliquot</hi> or other Integral Parts, to serve for the lesser Coins before Propos'd, so that none of them will come forth in any Fractional Part of a Farthing, which will obviate much Perplexity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Common People: And I think there is scarce any other Sum near it that is Deviseable in like manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> By this Project, all Computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Pounds, Shillings and Pence, used in Accounts; and the Reckonings by Pounds, Marks, Half-Marks, Shillings and Pence, practised in the Law of <hi>England,</hi> and in the Records, Contracts and other Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, relating thereunto, will be Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as they ought to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> By this Method, the bringing in of the present Unclipt Coins, to be cut into lesser Pieces, are rendered needless; which <hi>Species</hi> being at present (for the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107149:44"/>
most part) Hoarded, will, upon Raising their Value, come forth, and go a great way towards Supplying the Commerce and other Occasions, whilst the New Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is making. And I think it will be Granted to be utterly impossible, in this time of War, to Re-Coin the Clipt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, if at the same time the Unclipt shall be brought in to be new Cut; or if the Unclipt Pieces should not (by such an Encouragement) be brought forth to Supply the Commerce, Pay Taxes, and serve other Occasions in the mean time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eighthly,</hi> It is difficult to Conceive, how any Design of Amending the Clipt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys can be compassed, without Raising the Value of the Silver remaining in them, because of the great Deficiency of the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Clipt away; which (upon Re-Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) must necessarily be Defrayed or Born one way or other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ninthly,</hi> As our Unclipt Moneys, and the New Coins here Propos'd to be made, will, by the former Proposition, retain the <hi>Ancient Sterling,</hi> or <hi>Old Right Standard</hi> of the Mint for Fineness and Purity (the Alteration of which could never be Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107149:44"/>
by any Necessity;) so by this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition they will both Continue the <hi>Present Standard</hi> of the Mint in the Weight or Bigness of the respective Pieces, without being cut into Less, as they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been (the New Shilling only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted:) These Propositions indeed, deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with nothing but the very Value of the Silver in the Coins, to make it equal to the Currant Price of our own Bullion or Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in Mass, with a very little Excess, to wit, of an Half-peny in an Ounce, to encourage the Coinage, and to make it bear the like Reason or Proportion to the Price of Foreign Moneys now Currant amongst us; Namely, the <hi>Pillar Dollars,</hi> which go at Seven Shillings and a Peny <hi>per</hi> Ounce, and <hi>Sevil</hi> and <hi>Mexico Dollars</hi> at Seven Shillings <hi>per</hi> Ounce, and to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect an equality in all Pieces, having the same Extrinsick Denomination, and thereby to cure such Mischiefs relating to our Coin, as are not to be Parallel'd in the Records of former Ages: Which Raised Values may be Lowered again by the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Authority of Parliament, when the Wealth of the Nation shall (by Gods
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107149:45"/>
Blessing) be Re-establisht without Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or Charge of Re-coining or Cutting the Silver Pieces into other Sizes.</p>
                  <p>As to the Gold Coins which are now almost wholly Reduced or Converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pieces called <hi>Guineas</hi> and <hi>Half-Guineas,</hi> they were first Coin'd by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, not long after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration; and were ordained to go at the Rates of Twenty Shillings for the Guinea, and Ten Shillings for the Half-Guinea; but I do not remember that they ever passed at so little, as the Prices which were then set upon them  because our Nation has been always too apt to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value its Gold. And at this time the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea runs for Thirty Shillings, although the Gold of it (if it were carried to <hi>Spain, Italy, Barbary,</hi> and some other Places of the World) would not Purchase so much Silver there, as is equal to the Standard of Four of our Crowns, or Twenty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. And here it is necessary for me to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, That if the Gold had Advanced pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably with the Silver, then because as Five Shillings (the Standard Value of the Silver in a Crown) is to Six Shillings
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107149:45"/>
and Two Pence Halfpeny, the present Value of the same Silver in Mass, so Twenty Shillings (the Standard Value of the Gold in <hi>Guinea</hi>) is to Twenty four Shillings and Ten Pence; It should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low by Reason that a Guinea at this day should go for about Twenty four Shillings and Ten Pence, but it apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly runs for about Five Shillings more, so that in the time that the Silver in a Crown is Risen about a Fifth part, the Gold in a Guinea is Risen in a much greater propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely, a compleat Third part. Which Advance of Five Shillings in a Guinea (over and above the proportionable Rise which it should have had to make it keep pace with the Silver) is exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimental to our Nation at this Day (as will be hereafter shewed more at large.) And seeing it can be attributed to nothing but the present Badness of our Silver Coins, which are so exceedingly Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, and Clipt, that the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will take Guineas almost at any Rate, rather than stand the hazard and vexation of such Silver Moneys as are now Currant amongst them: I am therefore humbly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107149:46"/>
of Opinion, That altering the <hi>present Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard</hi> of our Gold Coins (which prescribes Twenty two Carats Fine, and Two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats Allay, and that Fourty four Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas and an Half shall be cut from a Pound Weight of such Gold) would avail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And that the only remedy to fix these Gold Coins upon a right Foot, will be the Re-establishment of the Silver Coins, which (as soon as Atchieved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these Propositions) will in all likelihood and probability, presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Guineas to about Twenty five Shillings apiece by the most Natural and Easie way, without fixing any limited Price thereupon by Publick Authority, which (if one were to judge by past Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) would never be observed, at least for any time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Corollary</hi>: The abovementioned <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Trade</hi> being (as is before obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) the Original Cause of the Scarcity of Silver in <hi>England,</hi> and of the Loss by the Foreign Exchange or Remittances, he that can propose any proper Expedients, either to lessen that Ballance, or convert it to our Advantage, ought to be well
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107149:46"/>
heard. But any Proposal which supposes the <hi>Ballance of Trade</hi> must be Rectified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Coins be Amended, or a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Foundation can be fixed for the Course of the same, does but <hi>postpone</hi> the Cure of a Disease which may destroy us before such a Remedy can take effect.</p>
                  <p>The True and Reasonable Adjustment of that which is called by the <hi>French, Pied de Monoye,</hi> and by others Anciently <hi>Pes Monetae,</hi> was and is of principal Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in this whole Affair: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope your Lordships will Excuse me for having been so prolix in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the <hi>Standards.</hi>

               <head>The Second General Head concerning the present State and Condition of the Gold and Silver Coins.</head>
               <p>IT cannot be thought impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per before the Enterprizing of a Work of so great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance as the Re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Moneys, and Determining a New Foot for the Course of the same, to be instructed (with as much certainty as is possible in things of this Nature) in the present State, Plight, or Condition of the Coins of this Realm; wherein one must necessarily consider se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Matters of Fact, whereof some can be known or found out, and others can only be estimated or guessed at. I have endeavoured, as much as I could in a little time, to Inform and Satisfie my self in the Particulars following:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The several Forms or Fashions which have been used in the Fabrication
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:107149:47"/>
of the Moneys, and which of them have been and are most likely to be most Secure against Clipping and Counterfeiting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Quantities of Silver Coins Clipt and Unclipt, that may be reasonably thought or imagined to remain in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How far the Clipt Pieces now in being may be Conjectured to have been diminished in their Weight. And upon Consideration of these Articles, I have endeavoured to Compute the Loss, which (upon Re-coining the Clipt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys) must be born either by a Publick Aid, or by Particular Persons, or by both; and to make such other Remarks and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences as may be suitable to the present Occasion: In all which, my Sence and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion are humbly presented to your Lordships in the manner following.</p>
               <p>As to the Particulars; All the Moneys we have now in <hi>England,</hi> both Gold and Silver, are reducible to Two sorts; the one Stampt with the Hammer, and the other Prest with an Engine, called the <hi>Mill.</hi> The Gold or Silver of the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer'd Money is first Cast from the Melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107149:48"/>
Pot into long Bars, those Bars are cut with Sheers into several square Pieces of exact Weights, for Sovereigns, Angels, Crowns, Half-Crowns, Shillings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then with the Tongs and Hammer they are Forged into a Round Shape; after which they are Blanched (that is, made White, or refulgent by Nealing or Boiling) and afterwards Stampt or Impress'd with an Hammer to make them perfect Money. This Method of making Money with the Hammer (as appears in the said <hi>Red Book</hi>) was practised in the Reign of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the First; who (amongst other great Archievements of his most Prudent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) left that of Restoring and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishing good Moneys for the Use of his People, to recommend his Name to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent Generations. He sent for Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam de Turnemire,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Peter,</hi> and others from <hi>Marseilles,</hi> and one <hi>Frisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald,</hi> and his Companions from <hi>Florence,</hi> and Employed them in the Working this kind of Money, and the Buying and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing of Silver for that purpose, for which he had Thirty Furnaces at <hi>London,</hi> Eight at <hi>Canterbury</hi> (besides Three the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:107149:48"/>
Arch-Bishop had there) Twelve at <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol,</hi> Twelve at <hi>York,</hi> and more in other great Towns, in all which Places they made the said Hammer'd Money of Silver, supply'd by the Kings Changers Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the same Places, who (according to certain Rates or Prices prescribed to them) took in the Clipt, Rounded and Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Moneys to be Re-Coined, and Bought Gold and Silver of the Merchants, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to be Fabricated into New Money; at the same time Ordaining, <hi>Quod Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metur per totum Regnum quod nulla fiat ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sura de Nova Moneta sub periculo Vitae &amp; Membrorum &amp; amissionis omnium Terrarum &amp; Tenementorum, &amp;c.</hi> And this kind of Hammer'd Money continued through all the Reigns of Succeeding Kings and Queens, till about the Year of our Lord, 1663. when by several Warrants, and Command of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, to wit, by One Warrant Dated the Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> 1662. One Warrant Dated the Eighth of <hi>April,</hi> 1663. And a Third Warrant Dated the Twenty fourth of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> 1663. The other sort called <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Money</hi> was first Fabricated to be Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107149:49"/>
in <hi>England</hi> in this manner: <hi>First,</hi> The Gold or Silver is cast out of the Melting Pot into long flat Bars, which Bars are drawn thorough a Mill (wrought by a Horse) to produce the just Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Guineas, Half-Guineas, Crowns, Half-Crowns, Shillings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then with forcible Engines, called <hi>Cutters,</hi> which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer exactly to the respective Sizes or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions of the Money to be made, the Round Pieces are cut out from the Flat Bar, shaped as aforesaid (the Residue whereof, called <hi>Sizel,</hi> is Melted again) and then every Piece is Weighed, and made to agree exactly with the intended Weight, and afterwards carried to other Engines (wrought secretly) which put the Letters upon the Edges of the larger Silver Pieces, and Mark the Edges of the rest with a Graining. The next thing is the Blanching perform'd, as above; and at last, every Piece is brought to the Press, which is called the <hi>Mill</hi> (wrought by the Strength of Men) and there Receives the Impression, which makes it perfect <hi>Milled Money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:107149:49"/>By duly reflecting upon these different Kinds, and Considering that the Principal Offences against the Coins of the Realm, have been, and are either Clipping, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting or Melting down, It may be proper to Remark,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That the Crime of <hi>Clipping</hi> has been Practised upon the Hammer'd Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in all Ages more or less, but most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitantly of late Years; notwithstanding the many Examples of Justice: For that the Offenders make an excessive Profit by doing a thing so easie in it self, that even Women and Children (as well as Men) are capable of the Act of Clipping or Rounding. But this Practice of Clipping has never been Exercis'd upon the Mill'd Money, and I think never can be, because of its Thickness and Edging, although no further Provision against the same should be made by Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That as to <hi>Counterfeiting,</hi> the Hammer'd Money is liable thereunto, because the Tools for Resembling the same, are cheap, and easily made and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and the Fabrication thereof may
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107149:50"/>
be performed in a little Room, and with less Art; so that Smiths and other Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers can readily attain thereunto. But the Engines for the Mill'd Money are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and very costly, not easie to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. The Makers or Users of such En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines cannot be conceal'd without great difficulty, and the Mill'd Money it self, being of a much Finer Print than the other, requires more Solemnity, Skill, and curious Workmanship in its Fabrication; and when it's finished, shews better the true Colour of the Silver, to distinguish its Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine from its Counterfeit Pieces: Which latter could never be brought to Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that Reckoning only since the said Year 1663. (without any regard to the Precedent time) I verily believe for every single Piece of Mill'd Money, that has been Counterfeited, or rather been attempted to be Resembled, there have been more than One thousand of the Hammer'd Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys not only Counterfeited, but actually Impos'd upon the People, who have been defrauded therewith, and are now likely to suffer greatly thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:107149:50"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That as to the Crime of <hi>Melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down,</hi> it has plainly affected both the Hammer'd and Mill'd Moneys in their respective turns very fatally; insomuch that the Hammer'd Gold Coins which were made in the Reigns of the several Kings and Queens, from <hi>Edward</hi> the First inclusively, till the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second (which would amount to an incredible Sum, if they were all in being) are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most totally vanished, having been Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (as I suppose) from time to time, either to make Vessels or Utensils, or to Export for Lucre, or to Convert into Gold Coins of more Modern Stamps (in which last Case the same Metal came to be Coin'd over and over again) it being evident that we have now in <hi>England</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Pieces called <hi>Guineas,</hi> and <hi>Half-Guineas,</hi> or few other of Gold Coins, as is before observed. And I think the like must have been done with all the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer'd Silver Moneys that were made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few only excepted; although the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would amount to many Millions, if
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:107149:51"/>
they were all now in being. As to the Coins of that Queen, and her Two imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Successors (though they make the Bulk of our present Cash) the Number of them must needs have been extreamly diminished by Melting, especially whilst they were weighty, and not much worn. But since the Mill'd Money came into Play, because of its Intrinsick Weight and Worth, I believe the Crime of Melting hath been chiefly practis'd upon that kind, which has apparently reduced it to a small Quantity. Nevertheless, when both kinds come to have the same Weight and Fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and to be Currant at the same Price, I think the one will not be more liable to this Mischief than the other; and I hope both will be Secured against the same, when the Silver in the Coin will fetch as much as the Silver in the Bullion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, The Quantities of Silver Coins Clipt and Vnclipt that may be reasonably thought or imagined to Remain in the Kingdom at this day,</hi> cannot with any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty be Computed. I know several Conjectures have been made thereof, very different, and (as I think) without any

Grounds at all, and I confess my self to have none but such as follow.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the Diminution of the Number of the Shillings, and Six-pences of the same Queen, many of which may be supposed to be Melted down, Re-Coined, or Lost.</p>

by the Melting, Re-Coining, or Loss of many (if not most) of the Half-Crowns, Shillings, and Six-Pences of those Two Kings, one can hardly believe there is now in being, of the Coins of the said Three Reigns, above One Third Part, which Amounts to Five Millions Thirty six thousand Four hundred ninety two Pounds; to which if there be added Five hundred Sixty three thousand Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eight Pounds more, for the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melted Silver Coins of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, <hi>Iames</hi> the Second, King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and for the small Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which remain of those which were made before the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; then the whole of the Silver <hi>Sterling</hi> Coins Clipt and Unclipt, Hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Currant now in <hi>England,</hi> will be Computed at Five Millions and Six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand Pounds. And if it be Granted that Four Millions of this Sum consists of Pieces that are Diminished, some more, some less, by Clipping, then it will follow, that there remains in the Kingdom about One Million, and Six hundred thousand Pounds of Heavy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107149:54"/>
a great part of which is supposed to lie in Hoards, and the rest Currant chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Counties most remote from <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I am to Compute, as well as I can, <hi>How far the Clipt Pieces, now in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may have been Diminished in their Weight.</hi> In reference to which, your Lordships may be pleased to be Remind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That when the Earl of <hi>Rochester</hi> was Lord Treasurer, several Good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were Established by him for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer; One of which was, to have all the Bags of Money there Received to be Weighed. And I have Extracted from the Books of One of the Tellers, the Weight of Five hundred seventy two Bags of One hundred Pound each, which were brought to the Receipt promiscuously, in the Months of <hi>May, Iune</hi> and <hi>Iuly</hi> last. Now, whereas the Weight of One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> in Silver Moneys, according to the Standard of the Mint, ought to be Thirty two Pounds, Three Ounces, One Peny Weight, and Twenty two Grains <hi>Troy,</hi> and consequently the said Bags, containing

Fifty seven thousand Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds by Tale,<note place="margin">

                  </note> ought to have Weighed Two hundred twenty one thousand Four hundred and Eighteen Ounces, Sixteen Peny Weight, and Eight Grains <hi>Troy:</hi> It was found that the said Fifty seven thousand and Two hundred Pounds by Tale (comprizing some Weighty Pieces, though few) Weighed only One hundred and thirteen thousand Seven hundred and Seventy one Ounces and Five Peny Weight <hi>Troy.</hi> So that if all the said Sum of Fifty seven thousand and Two hundred Pounds by Tale were good Silver, yet it was Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in Weight, One hundred and seven thousand six hundred fourty seven Ounces, Eleven Peny Weight and Eight Grains <hi>Troy</hi>; from whence I infer,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That the Moneys commonly Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant are Diminished near one Half, to wit, in a Proportion something greater than that of Ten to Twenty two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That going by the <hi>Medium</hi> of the said Number of Bags, and making but a very small Allowance for the Unclipt Pieces in the said Bags, and for the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107149:55"/>
of Money brought to the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, and that which passes amongst the Common People (the former being in most Payments the best of the Clipt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys) every one must be convinced, That if all the Clipt Pieces of Silver Moneys in <hi>England</hi> could be weighed together, they would be found Deficient a full Half of their Standard Weight. Again,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If all the Pieces in <hi>England</hi> that are more or less Clipt, do Amount by Tale to Four Millions (as is before sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed) then I infer, That by Re-Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same upon the Old Foot, it will make but Two Millions, and the Loss would be as much: But by Re-Coining the same upon the Foot of Six Shillings and Three Pence for the present Crown Piece, as is above proposed, the same Quantity of Clipt Money will make Two Millions, and Five hundred thousand Pounds, and the Loss will be Fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand Pounds, to be born either by Publick Aid, or by the Particulars in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested in the Clipt Moneys, or by both.</p>

               <head>The Third General Head Discusses this Question, Whether it be or be not absolutely Necessary at this time to Re-establish the Coins.</head>
               <p>IT will readily be Granted, That the Melting and New Fabricating the much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Part of all the Silver Moneys of the Realm (as the Clipt Pieces are) would be a Work very improper to be Enterprized in the heat of an Important and Expensive War; if the doing thereof were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensibly necessary, to render effectual the very Ways and Means, which in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament may be Resolved upon, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Aids or Supplies for Carrying on of the same War, and to produce a <hi>Species</hi> of Money that may be Useful and Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the Upholding of the Commerce, and for answering not only of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:107149:56"/>
but also of all Private Revenues, Rents, Debts, and other Occasions, which concern the very Existence of the great Political Body.</p>
               <p>It were enough for me upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to say, That the House of Commons judg'd it necessary to have the Clipt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys Re-Coin'd, having Resolved thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after many long and mature Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, in the last Session of Parliament. But the Evils which for some time past have been growing upon us, in respect of the Coins, being at length actually Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and more sensibly Felt, I shall take leave humbly to State the same according to the best of my Understanding, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Judgment thereof to Publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because such of the Silver Coins as are usually Currant, or offer'd in Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are very Bad and Defective; the Common People (without any visible Reason, other thanto avoid the Danger and Vexation of such Moneys) by almost an Unanimous Consent and Agreement, do take Guineas at Thirty Shillings apiece, little more or less, which Raises the Gold
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107149:56"/>
here (as hath been observed) to a much higher Price in Proportion than Silver in Bullion now goes at, or that Silver in Coin will go for, when it shall be Raised to the Foot of Six Shillings and Three Pence for the Crown Piece according to this Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And this exorbitant Price of Gold here, hath encouraged Foreign Merchants to Import it upon us in great Quantities: And in Return for the same,</p>
               <p>They either Export our Silver in Coin or Molten; which lying in a little Room, the Exportation thereof cannot easily be Prevented. Or,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They Buy our Native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities (the Interruption of the Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, not Allowing us such an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of Goods, brought from our Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in <hi>America,</hi> and other Foreign Parts, wherewith <hi>England</hi> in times of Peace could at least Ballance its Trade with its Neighbours.) Or,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They draw back the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Value of their Gold, by Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change or Remittances. In every one of these Cases, they make an unreasonable Profit by their Gold, which must needs,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107149:57"/>
in a little time, Exhaust a great part of the Real Stock and Wealth of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; But particularly in the first Case, the Bullion or Coin in Silver that is Exported, is really worth much more than the Gold Imported for it; and the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Dead Loss to <hi>England,</hi> which La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours too much already under the Scarcity of Silver, and will inevitably find it much Scarcer and Dearer than it is, if this Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Trade continues. In the Second Case, they can Furnish Foreign Markets with our Native Commodities, which would be carried thither by our own Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who want the aforesaid Profit of the Gold, to enable them to Buy those Goods as Dear, and Sell them as Cheap as the Foreigners can. And in the Third Case, by the great occasion they have for Bills to draw back the Value of their Gold to the Places from whence it came, they have Contributed in a great measure towards Lowering the Exchange to the <hi>Low Countries</hi>; which from divers Causes (whereof the Importing of Guineas is none of the least) is sunk so very Low, that the Publick loses about Four Shillings
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:107149:57"/>
in the Pound upon all the Moneys Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thither; which Loss Amounts to a great deal in the Charge of the Army. And the Exchange to <hi>Hamburgh</hi> and the <hi>East Countreys</hi> for all Naval Stores, and other Goods, is Lower, and to all Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> (where our Fleet is at present) the Exchange is yet more to our Prejudice. And in regard the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid excessive Advance of the Guinea Pieces, at least a great part thereof, can be Attributed (as has been before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served) to nothing else but the Base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Defects of the White Moneys, there is no Prospect of Reducing the Gold to a more moderate or reasonable Price, by any means consistent with the Interest of the Nation, other than the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, and Restoring of the Silver Coins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the present Condition and Circumstances of our Silver Money, this Nation and the Trade and Dealings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, are in a great measure Deprived of the Use and Benefit of the whole <hi>Species</hi> now in being, as well the Heavy Pieces as the Light; the former of which (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:107149:58"/>
since the Parliament in the last Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion appear'd desirous of making a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation or Amendment) have been for the most part Hoarded by the particular Persons Possessed thereof, in prospect that the Silver contained in those Weighty Pieces will be Raised to a Value suitable to the Bullion thereof if Melted, which they may think will turn more to their Profit than Lending at Interest, Purchasing or Trading therewith in the mean time; or at least they may think these Hoarded Moneys (when the Mischiefs of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting and Diminishing their Coins, come to their last Extremity) will parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly stand those Men in stead that have them; however it be, its certain the Weighty Moneys at present do very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle appear Abroad, and it is not likely they will soon be brought to Light, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Raising their Value, and Re-Coining the Clipt Moneys; and as for the latter, a great Part thereof, when offered in Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is utterly Refused, and will not Pass, and consequently doth not serve to the end or Purpose for which it was made: so that both the one and the other
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:107149:58"/>
(for the greatest Part) are become as it were a Dead Cash in the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In Consequence of the Vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Diminishing and Counterfeiting of the Currant Moneys, it is come to pass, That great Contentions do daily arise amonst the King's Subjects, in Fairs, Markets, Shops, and other Places throughout the Kingdom, about the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing or Refusing of the same, to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance of the Publick Peace; many Bargains, Doings and Dealings are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally prevented and laid aside, which lessens Trade in general; Persons before they conclude in any Bargains, are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated first to settle the Price or Value of the very Money they are to Receive for their Goods; and if it be in Guineas at a High Rate, or in Clipt or Bad Moneys, they set the Price of their Goods accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, which I think has been One great cause of Raising the Price not only of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes, but even of Edibles, and other Necessaries for the sustenance of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, to their great Grievance. The Receipt and Collection of the Publick Taxes, Revenues and Debts (as well as
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107149:59"/>
of Private Mens Incomes) are extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retarded, to the Damage of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and to the Prejudice of a Vigorous Prosecution of the War; so that there were never (at least since I had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to serve the Crown) so many Bonds Given, and lying Unsatisfied at the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom-Houses, or so vast an Arrear of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises. And as for the Land Tax, your Lordships know how far 'tis affected with the Bad Moneys, by the many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints transmitted daily from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, Receivers and Collectors thereof, and by Comparing the Sum brought into the Exchequer this Year, with the timely Payments of the like Tax in preceding Years. In fine, the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of the Bad Money (too many to enumerate) are so sensibly Felt, that (I humbly conceive) they are sufficient to Confute all the Arguments against the Re-Coining the same in this time of War, and even the Objections against Raising the Silver in our Coin to the Propos'd Value. Which Arguments and Objections (how Plausible or Weighty soever they have been heretofore) have not at this time
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107149:59"/>
sufficient Ground or Reason to Support them, especially when the doing of these things is not Projected for the particular Gain or Profit of the Crown ( which formerly Received a Duty of Seigniorage upon Coining or Re-coining of Moneys) but for the Common Good and Utility of the King and his People. But whether all the Evils and Mischiefs before mentioned, and the Increase thereof, which the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must undergo, till a Remedy be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, do infer, or are tantamount to an absolute Necessity for the present Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising the Work aforesaid, must be and is with all Humility submitted to a better Judgment than my own.</p>

               <head>The Fourth General Head is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Means that must be Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and the proper Methods to be used in and for the Re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Silver Coins.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN Case His Majesty (taking into His Princely Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the great Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies which the Nation Labours under by the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Moneys) shall be pleased to Direct, That all such Silver Coins called Crowns, Half-Crowns, Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings or Testers, as have been formerly Coin'd in the Royal Mint, or Mints of <hi>England</hi> with the Hammer, and are more or less Diminished by Clipping, Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Filing, or any other Artifice, shall be Melted and Re-Coin'd, my humble Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, That the General Cautions fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing are to be Observed;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:107149:60"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That the Work ought to be Performed and Finished in as little time as may be, not only to Obviate a further Damage by Clipping in the <hi>interim,</hi> but also that the needful Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of the New Money may be the sooner Obtained for the Service of the Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the loss, or the greatest part of it ought to be born by the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and not by Particulars, who being very Numerous will be prejudiced against a Reformation for the Publick Benefit, if it is to be Effected at the Cost of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Men, and who have great hopes of being Indemnified by the Votes Passed in their favour in the last Session of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This whole Affair must be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Easie, and very Intelligible to the Common People, so that they must not be compelled to Travel very far when they part with their Clipt Money, or when they receive back the Value of it in the New Coins; and in the mean time they must be furnished with a Useful and Transferrable Credit that must take Place
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107149:61"/>
in Course of Repayment, as fast as the New Coins can be made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That no room must be left for Jealousie. And therefore all the Clipt Moneys in the several Counties, far or near, are not to be brought entirely to <hi>London,</hi> to be Minted there; which would leave all the Countries very bare, and create great Suspicions till its Return.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That as soon as the King's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers begin to take in the Clipt Moneys, or presently after, the Course for Repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Stated Value thereof in New Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys ought to begin also, and to be Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by the New Moneys, which shall be Coin'd from the Silver of the Old, so far as it will Extend; And that an Aid be given in Parliament to Supply the residue, in such time and manner, as that there be no Interruption or Intervals in the Course of Repayment, till such times as the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters for the Clipt Moneys to be brought in shall be fully satisfied.</p>
               <p>According to these General Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and some other Requisites which have Occurred to me, I have imployed my Thoughts to Reduce this whole Affair
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107149:61"/>
into Practice, and do humbly Offer to your Lordships Consideration the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars following, as the Scope and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of my Report: That is to say,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That an Aid be granted in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and strictly Appropriated for or towards the making good of the Loss by the said Clipt Moneys, or so much thereof as shall be thought Reasonable to be Defrayed by the Publick, and the incident Charges which shall be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in the Performance of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Which Aid, if it be Commensurate to the whole Loss, will, by Estimation, as above, Amount to Fifteen hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Pounds; and if it be Resolved that the Publick shall bear but half the Loss, or any other part of it, then the Aid (in the grant thereof) may be proportioned accordingly. And the said Aid is humbly proposed to be either by a Land Tax of Twelve Pence in the Pound, or by a yearly Sum to be Answered out of the continued Impositions upon Goods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, or some other certain Fond, to take Effect within a year to come at the farthest.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:107149:62"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That all the New Moneys, whether they be Gold or Silver, shall in the Coining thereof be made in Fineness or Purity, according to the <hi>present Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,</hi> that is to say, the Gold to be Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two Carats Fine and Two Carats Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay: And the Silver Coins to be Eleven Ounces Two Peny Weight Fine, and Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Peny Weight Allay, for the Reasons above given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That every Pound Weight <hi>Troy</hi> of such. Gold, shall be cut into Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine Half Guineas, or Fourty four Guineas and an Half, or proportionably for greater Pieces, as the same ought to be by the present Indenture of the Mint; with a Remedy for the Master, of the Sixth Part of a Carat, in Case the Gold be found too strong or too feeble in Weight, or in Fineness, or in both. And that every Pound Weight <hi>Troy,</hi> of the New Silver Moneys, to be made as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, be cut into such Numbers of Pieces as will correspond in Weight with the Undimished Crowns, Half-Crowns, Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, Six-pences, Groats, Three-pences, Two-pences and Pence, Coin'd by the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107149:62"/>
late Indentures, except the Twelve Peny Pieces, all which may be performed, as is above offered. And that the Master be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a Remedy of Two Peny Weight in every Pound Weight <hi>Troy,</hi> of the Silver Moneys, in case they be found too strong or too feeble in Weight, or in Fineness, or in both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That by Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or by a Royal Proclamation to be Grounded on an Act of Parliament, the Silver Crowns, Half-Crowns, Shillings and Six-pences of the Lawful Coins of this Realm now in being, and not Diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Clipping, Rounding, Filing, Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or other Artifice, be Publickly Cried up, and Raised to the Foot of Seventy five Pence for the Crown, and proportionably for the rest, as I have also proposed; and that the other small Pieces of the Old Coins (which are few in number) go as they do at present. And that the New Coins to be called the <hi>Scepire,</hi> or <hi>Vnite,</hi> the <hi>Half-Scepire,</hi> or <hi>Half-Vnite,</hi> the <hi>Testoon</hi> or Fifteen Peny Piece, the <hi>Shilling</hi> or Twelve Peny Piece, the <hi>Half-Testoon,</hi> the <hi>Gross</hi> or Five Peny Piece, <hi>Quarter-Testoon,</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:107149:63"/>
the <hi>Half-Gross</hi> and <hi>Prime</hi> be made Currant upon the same Foot, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so propos'd, <hi>Pag.</hi> 61, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That Coin, as well as <hi>English</hi> Bullion, not exceeding a limited Sum yearly, may be Exported for the Service of the present War by His Majesty's War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and Command, and not otherwise; which will help to keep down the Price of Silver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That all the New Moneys be made by the Mill and the Press, and not by the Hammer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> That all the present Silver Pieces called Crowns, Half-Crowns, Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Six-pences of the Hammer'd kind, which are Diminished by Clipping, Rounding, Filing, Washing, or other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, be Cried down, so as not to be Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant after a Day to be prefix'd. And that no Person whatsoever shall hereafter be obliged to accept in Legal Payment any Money whatsoever that is already Clipt, or may hereafter be Clipt or Diminished; and that no Person shall Tender or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any such Money in Payment under some small Penalty, to be made easily Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107149:63"/>
the Passing, Selling, or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of such Clipt or Diminished Moneys, in Order to the Re-Coining thereof, as is herein after mentioned, only Excepted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> That no Crown Piece (of Old Hammer'd Money) shall be said or alledged to be Clipt or Diminished, or be Refused as such in any Payments what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, if it hold Eighteen Peny Weight; and proportionable Weight shall render the Half-Crowns, Shillings and Six-pences of the said Hammer'd kind to be Currant in all Payments; which seems necessary, because of the wearing of the Old Pieces, though they are not Clipt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> That besides the Principal Mint within the Tower of <hi>London</hi> (where Six Presses can be wrought at the same time) there be Settled and Established Nine other Mints within <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> to Work with Two Presses in each, Namely, One at <hi>Newcastle</hi> upon <hi>Tyne,</hi> to serve principally for the Counties of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Northumberland, Cumberland</hi> and <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merland</hi>: One at <hi>York</hi> to serve for the Counties of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi>: One at <hi>Nottingham</hi> to serve for the Counties of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107149:64"/>
                  <hi>Nottingham, Lincoln, Derby</hi> and <hi>Leicester:</hi> One at <hi>Chester,</hi> to serve for <hi>Cheshire, Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire, Salop</hi> and <hi>North Wales:</hi> One at <hi>Hereford</hi> to serve for the Counties of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford, Gloucester Worcester</hi> and <hi>South Wales:</hi> One at <hi>Exeter</hi> to serve for <hi>Cornwall, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>von</hi> and <hi>Somerset:</hi> One at <hi>Salisbury</hi> to serve for the Counties of <hi>Wilts, Dorset</hi> and <hi>Hantshire:</hi> One at <hi>Oxon,</hi> to serve for the Counties of <hi>Oxon, Bucks, Warwick,</hi> and <hi>Berks:</hi> And One at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to serve for <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk, Huntingdon, Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Bedfordshire</hi>; and that at <hi>London</hi> will serve for the rest. Nevertheless these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Mints are not intended to be so Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained but that a Man may carry his Money to any of them that lies most in his way; whereby there may be Coined Weekly (as I am inform'd) about Fifty or Sixty thousand Pounds easily, which will finish the whole Work in much less than a Years time. And that the Dyes, Presses and other Implements may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding with as much haste as is possible, so as to be all sit for Use by or before <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> next.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:107149:64"/>
                  <hi>Tenthly,</hi> That the Warden, Master Worker, Comptroller, and Assay-Master of the Mint do continue at the Tower, and take the immediate Care of the Work there: And that they Substitute Fit and Skilful Persons as their Deputies (such as the King, or the Lord Treasurer, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of the Treasury for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, shall approve of, and such as must be Answer'd for by their respective Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors) to Carry on the Works of the said Nine Mints in the Countrey; which Substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes shall be all Sworn, for the faithful Discharge of their respective Trust; and that the Members of the Corporation of the Moneyers, and other Ministers, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Servants, be distributed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and small Private Marks (if thought fit) may be made to distinguish the Money that shall be Coin'd at the respective Mints.</p>
               <p>

Neverthelss, for the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107149:67"/>
Explanation of this Project, and to shew how far it is practicable, one may (as I humbly Conceive) Assume any certain Part of this Loss, to be born by the Publick, as if it were Resolved. And Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that One hundred Pounds by Tale of all these Clipt or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished Moneys, if they were in One Heap, would not (by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation which I have made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of under the Second General Head) hold above Sixteen Pound Weight <hi>Troy,</hi> or thereabouts, one with another (which the King's Subjects dealing therein, do also find by daily Experience) I do from thence infer, that if the said Sixteen Pounds Weight <hi>Troy</hi> (which now Runs for One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds by Tale) be brought to the Changer, to be by him Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at Eight Shillings <hi>per</hi> Ounce; then the said Eight Shillings <hi>per</hi> Ounce, when it comes to be Paid in the New Money, will Amount to Seventy six Pound and Sixteen
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107149:68"/>
Shillings, which will plainly cast about Half the Loss upon the State and the rest upon the Owner of the Money (who will also find some Recompence in the Raised Value of his Unclipt Moneys, if he has any such.) Therefore let Eight Shillings <hi>per</hi> Ounce in the New Money be the Assumed or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Price, to be Computed by the Changer, for all the real Silver which he shall find to be remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in these Clipt Moneys; which Method of making good part of the Loss to the Subject by Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a large Price for every Ounce of the real Silver remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Clipt Money, seems to me to be much more secure, and to be (in all respects) a better way, than by Allowing him a Market Price only for the said Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver remaining, and Contributing to his Loss in Proportion to the Deficiency or Silver Clipt off; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in the latter Case it will be in his Power before he brings in his
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:107149:68"/>
Money to Clip it over again, and Reduce it so low, as that the deficient Weight (if it were to be made good at the Charge of the Publick) might be Twice, Thrice, Four times, Five times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as much as the real Silver brought in by him would amount to. Whereas by this Third Rule, the danger of far- Clipping is perfectly obviated, for no Man will Clip off Silver to Sell at Six Shillings Five Pence an Ounce by the Market Price, when he may carry it to the King's Change, and there Receive Eight Shillings <hi>per</hi> Ounce for it.</hi>

                     <hi rend="margQuotes">WHereas the said Clipt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, so to be brought in, do retain very different and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Weights and Sizes, as they are more or less Clipt; and it is evident that a Clipt Crown, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than Twelve Peny Weight and Twelve Grains,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107149:69"/>
will produce more than Five Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in New Money if it should be Changed by it self at Eight Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings an Ounce; and an Half-Crown holding more than Six Peny Weight and Six Grains, will (if it were Changed by it felf for Eight Shillings an Ounce) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce more than Two Shillings and an Half in the New Money; and the like may be said of the Old Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Six-pences not Clipt to a lower Degree in Proportion. I have Considered (although the Government would not suffer in this Case) that Goldsmiths and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Subtil Dealers in Money, will be very apt (if an effectual Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be not Provided against their Artifices) to Cull out the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viest of their Clipt Pieces, and to get such into their Hands from their Neighbours, to Change them at Eight Shillings an Ounce, and thereby Gain for them more New Moneys in Tale than ever they Amounted to in their old Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107149:69"/>
And in regard One hundred Pounds by Tale of the said Clipt Moneys, holding in Weight Two hundred and fifty Ounces <hi>Troy,</hi> when it is Changed at the said Rate of Eight Shillings an Ounce, will produce one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds in Tale of the said New Moneys; therefore it is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, That every Person who brings any Clipt or Diminished Moneys to be Changed, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, shall be obliged to mingle so many of his lighter Pieces with his heavier Pieces, as that upon the Draught or Weighing of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they may not at the said Rate of Eight Shillings an Ounce fetch more of the New Moneys in Tale than the said Clipt Money was Coined for in its Old Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, that is to say, One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds by Tale of such Clipt Moneys, shall be so mingled with heavier and lighter Pieces as that it shall not exceed Two hundred and fifty Ounces in Weight; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107149:70"/>
other Sum of Clipt Money shall be restrained to the same propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: This will effectually prevent the said trick of Culling, and create little or no Difficulty in Practice, because amongst all the Clipt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, those which might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Advantage above-mentioned are few in comparison of the rest, and a Sum consisting only of such Weighty Pieces will not in probability ever be brought to the Changers by any, but by Crafty or Designing Men.

               <head>The Fifth General Head Considers what must Supply the Commerce, Pay Taxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whilst the Clipt Money is under its New Fabrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</head>
               <p>THis Question is to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, by Reminding your Lordships of several Particulars which have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready occured in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, with a small Addition, as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Weighty Money (both Mill'd and Hammer'd) now Hoarded, will come forth at a Raised Value, which (according to the above Estimation) may make One Million and Six hundred thousand Pounds more or less; besides the Guineas and Half Guineas, which are but too numerous at their present Rate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Bills for the Clipt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney will be so Profitable and Certain,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107149:77"/>
and have such a quick Course of Payment, as aforesaid, that they will serve as so much Running Cash; and in the coming forth, the Number of them will encrease from day to day; that from First to Last, they will by Estimation amount to above Three Millions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As those Bills are Paid off, the New Moneys Coin'd, with the Silver of the Clipt, will come in their stead, the Fabrication whereof will begin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, and the Work will be Carried on with as much Expedition as can be made by Ten Mints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Importers of Bullion, and all others that have or can have any Foreign or <hi>English</hi> Silver (even the Silver of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Moneys) in their Hands, will have a visible Encouragement to carry the same forthwith to the Mint to be Coin'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It may be Enacted, That all Persons that Sell Wine, Strong-waters, Bear, Ale or other Liquors by Retail, shall by a Prefixt Day, bring their Tankards, Cups, Dishes and other Plate to some or one of the Mints, to be Coin'd into New Money, at the Rate of Six Shillings and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107149:78"/>
Five Pence Half-peny an Ounce, under Pain of Forfeiture thereof, and that the New Money proceeding from the same shall be Delivered to them according to the present Course of the Mint.</p>
               <p>I have ( my Lords ) in this difficult Matter Considered and Digested as many things as were possible for me in so short a time; and I cannot forbear (before I end) to Alledge, that if the Coins are to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and Established according to these Propositions (which may be Rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Improved by Men of greater Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Skill) I cannot foresee that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven whilst the Work is Carrying on, there will Accrue such Publick Disorder, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or Distress, as the Nation Labours under before the Work is put in hand.</p>

               <p>POrro Miles Argentarius ab inferiore Scac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cario ad superius differt Loculum exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minandi Argenti, cujus supra meminimus, quem cum intulerit Signatum Sigillo Vicecomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, sub omnium oculis effundit in Scaccario xxiiii. Solidos quos de Acervo Sumptos prius Signaverit, factaque Commixtione eosdem, ut ponderi respondeant, mittit in unum Vasculum trutinae libram ponderis, in alterum vero de Denariis quod Oportuit, Quo facto, numerat eosdem ut ex numero constare possit, si legitimi ponderis sint, cujuscunque vero

ponderis inventi fuerint, seorsum mittit in Ciffum libram unam, hoc est xx. Solidos, ex quibus examen fiat, reliquos vero xxiiii. Solidos mittit in Loculum. Item duo De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narii praeter libram examinandam dantur Fusori, non de Fisco, sed de parte Vicecomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, quia in praemium sui laboris.</p>
               <p>Tunc eliguntur a Praesidente vel a Thesau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rario, si ille absens fuerit, alii duo Vic. ut simul cum Argentario, Necnon &amp; Vicecomite, cujus examen faciendum est, procedant ad Ignem, ubi Fusor ante praemonitus, praepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratis Necessariis, eorum praestolatur adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107149:79"/>
hoc autem ipsum providere dicunt hii qui ad idem missi sunt a Majoribus. Facto igitur examine defert illud Argentarius ad Barones, Comitantibus illis, &amp; tunc in omnium Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis ponderat illud cum libra praedicta ponderis, supplet autem mox quod ignis consumpsit, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positis denariis ejusdem loculi, donec aequili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briter se habeat examen cum pondere. Tunc inscribitur idem examen desuper ducta Creta hiis verbis, <hi>Everwicscir,</hi> libra arsit tot vel tot denarios, &amp; tunc illud <hi>Essaium</hi> dicitur. Non enim inscribitur nisi praeconcessio quod sic stare debeat. Quod si Vicecomes, cujus est, Calumpniatus fuerit, illud quasi plus justo consumptum fuerit ignis scilicet exaestuatione vel plumbi infusione, vel &amp; Fusor ipse, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet Occasione defecisse fateatur examen, ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum numerentur xx.
