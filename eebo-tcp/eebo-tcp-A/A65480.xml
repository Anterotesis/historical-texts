         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The word of God to all the Elect number with a
few words in a deep Lamentation over the seed of Life,
to its tender Father concerning them that have transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in Israel.</head>
            <p>DEar blessed precious Lambs and Babes, ye children of the
most high God, holy innocent and undefiled, I feel a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
a very small Remnant, that are but few in number,
with whom my life dwells in pure unity never to be separated, that
God Almighty hath gathered and is gathering in this day of his
mighty power from amongst all people, nations, kindreds, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
tongues and languages, upon the face of the whole Earth,
who shall be one of a Family and two of a Tribe, which is but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few in number, even you shall shine, as the lights of heaven, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
as the Sun, cleer as the Moon, Glittering and sparkling as the
Stars. Yea, the very brightness of your pure light, and beauty of
your glory shall shine from corner to corner, and from end to end of
all the world, that so all nations may see, and hear yea dread tremble
and fear. But you must and shall come through many and great
tribulations and be refined even as the pure gold, that is seven times
tried in the fire, and must have your garments died in the blood of
the Lamb, and be clothed in fine Linning clean and white, mark
that, it must be clean and white there must be no filthyness neither
any defilement: not one spot nor blemish, for if there be while
that remaineth, Mark while any spot remaineth thou maiest not be
suffered to dwell with the Lamb and to follow him whethersoever
he goeth, who is of more purer eyes then to behold iniquity, so
the pure Virgin state every perticular must witness before the heir
of life can be born to whom all power belongs in Heaven and in
Earth and power sufficient to withstand the power of the wicked
one in all his temptations can never be received till he the heir of
life is born up in dominion over all, and hath the government upon
his shoulders, and now may not the cry of many be who hath been
long convinced even as the cry of some of the Disciples was when
the Lord said, <hi>he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33446:2"/>
me and I in him as the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the
Father even so he that eateth me shall live by me, shall live by me, this
is that bread that came dovvn from Heaven, not as your fathers did eat
Manna and are dead, he that eateth this bread shall live for ever.</hi> Did
they not then cry out this is an hard saying who can abide the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, and did not many of his Disciples from that very time go
back and forsake him, and walked no more with him, then said
Jesus to the Twelve, <hi>Will yee also go away then Simon Peter answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him Lord to whom shall we go, thou hast the words of Eternal life,
and vve believe and are sure that thou art Christ the Son of the living
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My dear Friends, I do not write thus to you onely as it is the
Scriptures Language neither because you know it not already but
even as the Lord hath given it me in his own eternal word of Life
and power, therefore every one search your own hearts try your
selves even all the secret motions of your minds and all your deep
thoughts, and see with the light of Christ in you whether or no
your hearts are upright, and approved of in the sight of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
God. Who searcheth secretly all your hearts and tryes your
reins whose name is the Lord of Host the Almighty and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Counseller and Conquerer very dreadful and terrible to all his
enemies before whom, and in whose presence ye are all naked and
bare, to whom you must all give up your accompts whether Just or
Unjust and the time is near at hand: Therefore my Dear friends,
see that every one of you lay true Judgement to the line, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
to the Plummet, and all Judge your selves least you be
Judged and try with the pure holy Light in your own Consciences
whether or nay, ye are of that number as is before mentioned for
verily and in Gods name I am made bold in his everlasting authority
and endless dominion to declare it, none other shall dwell with the
Lambe in the new City <hi>Sion</hi> for ever more, therefore O weigh it in
the deep Considerations of your pure mind. For I do proclaim it in
the name of the Lord our God and shall be ready to seal it with my
Dearest blood, yee have already received the first and last and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Messuage or dispensation that ever was is or ever shall be, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
look not for another but always in that you have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
grow and increase, holding fast that you have and letting
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33446:2"/>
nothing of it go least another take your Crown and to rob you of
your honour, even the pure holy and undefiled Light, and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
shall presume to declare of any other or a greater dispensation
then that which hath been declared of already let him or them to
you be accursed for evermore if an Angel or Angels from heaven
for such do and will pervert the way of God, and so will strive, to
lead poor simple innocent persons, people after them into their
own pernissious ways quite contrary to the way of God where
they shall never know peace for their immortal souls, but they who
dwell in the everlasting light truly fearing his dreadfull name and
evermore trembling in his pure presence at the word of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
who is God, blessed for ever more Amen, Even they and none
but they shall sing the song of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Lambe for evermore,
for they onely are found worthy, worthy, worthy, to sit upon
the Throne Judging and ruling amongst the twelve Tribes of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
for ever more who hath been and ever shall be taught by the
Lord, and have learned the pure Language from his own Mouth and
speaks no other words then he hath taught you, even you are the
pure virgins indeed who must alwaies dwell with the Lamb in
the presence of his Grace singing praises and sounding fourth Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah's
to him that sits upon the Throne, who was slain by our sins
but is now become our eternal Resurrection who onely is worthy
to receive of all his blessed number power and riches and wisdome
and strength and honour and glory and blessing, World without
end, Amen.</p>
            <p>So all dear Lambs dwell with the Lord, that you may at all times
walk with him in the deeps where you may evermore behold his
Glory, that so in his living presence yee may be refreshed in all times
of need, even eating of the living bread when yee hunger and
Drinking of the pure Fountain when you are athurst that so all
may be wholy satisfied and none to go forth but that all may
dwell within where your strength is that is able to support you
now and for evermore. That so great may be your unity in the
pure spirit that in unfeigned love and holy fellowship, your hears
mindes souls and spirits may be lincked Joined and united together
in one bond in the band of Peace and in the Covenant of Life ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be seperated from the presence of the living God nor one
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33446:3"/>
from another so in patience possess ye your own hearts and dwell
together in the meek seed of life where in the deeps you may feel
the inocent life of your dear suffering brother.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>A Word to the Transgresser</head>
               <p>O All Mighty, all Powerful, God of Power of Heaven and
Earth who in the Majesty of thy Power and strength of
thine Almightiness, art risen by the strength of thine Arm
to plead with all that are back-sliding in <hi>Israel</hi> and in this Cause
wherein thou hast been provoked by a backsliding People, whom
thou by a mighty hand and outstretched arm hast brought out of
the Land of Darkness and from the house of Bondage, who have
again Provoked thee: Even in the Wilderness and also in the good
Land: And now although <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> should stand before
thee: and although thy Righteous Servants should petition to
thee never so much yet thou wilt not hear as concerning this
thing whereby thou hast been provoked, neither wilt thou be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
by us, but certainly thou wilt arise and plead strongly with
them all because they have so grieved thy good spirit in so often
provoking and sinning against thee. Yet O holy righteous father thy
own blessed suffering seed is very tender and I know tis very Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
in thy sight, O our Dear Father, and is not its inocent
tender babelike cry in the meekness of thine own spirit aloud unto
thee O spare dear Lord, O spare thy People for blessed <hi>Abraham,</hi>
thy servants sake, and for the sake of the seed of thy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with whom and to whom all thy Promises are as yea and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
for evermore, oh remember, Dear Lord remember and keep
not thine Anger for ever. oh let it be but in thy fatherly pitty
a tender gentle Chastisement to draw them nearer to thee then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that so they may have great cause to bless and honour thy
great name now and for evermore Amen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:33446:3"/>
And as I was thus in my Measure very quiet and very still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently
in peace and in joy with my Maker he shewed me Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thee O Israel that some within thy Borders had caused and
do yet cause thee to erre, the effects of which cause will and shall
bring sad tediousnesse to them in thee O Israel who have so highly
offended the righteous pure unchangable God; in minding poor
changable man beyond what he is or ever was or ever shall be
while he is here in this bodie, I tell thee O Israel that which hath
been seen concerning this matter hath so highly provoked God
that he will not easily be reconciled to them in thee who have thus
offended, nay nay but for this offence thou must be Chastized and
Greatly afflicted and now in this day have ye not throne down
one and set up another, and is there not now a very great cause
given unto us to bear in remembrance at all times the words of our
Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ concerning that evill sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
servant, but if that evill slothfull servant shall say in his heart
my Lord delaieth his comming and shall begin to smite his fellow
servants and to eat and drink with the drunken, the Lord of that
servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an
hour that he is not ware of: Oh consider this all you that have
stolen a side from the deep sence and from feeling of your first love
wherein there was no evill neither any Guile, that so with speed you
may return and receive him as in the beginning that so love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained
may spring up in your hearts and life and vertue abound in
you that ye may be Grafted into the true Vine to receive of its pure
sap and vertue before you are wholly cut off as drie and fruitless
withered branches, O Remember this every on that hath forgoten
God, and with speed return least he arise in his Mighty power and
Cut you asunder and appoint you your portion with hypocrites
there shall be <hi>weeping and wailing Gnashing of teeth, and as the
daies of Noah was so shall the comming of the son of man be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Friends it is sealed in my heart by the Eternal spirit of the Lord.</p>
               <p>These be the daies he spake of, and are not many now to the
great Griefe of the pure spirit, Marrying and given in Mariage not
being moved of the Lord, and is not the Arke of God prepared and
preparing, and is there safty any where else save only in the Arke

is preparing that are Making merry, Namely eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Marrying and giving in Marriage, bulding Planting and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
as though the day of the Lord should never over take you
being out of the fear of the Lord and dread and awe of his holy
Name, alass, alass, how many have been sporting themselves against
the faithfull Ministers and true messengers of God, who have often
told you in tears and in deep lamentations such a day would
assuredly overtake many and how faithfull have they been in Laying
it before you and Charging it upon you to watch always, and
pray continually, least you enter into temptation but oh how have
you slighted them and have not many amongst you in your own
Immaginations Judged one and Condemned another whom God
hath Eternally sealed in the Everlasting Covenant of life and peace
for ever more: and are you still indeed so blinde to thinke that
the Lords eye is not open beholding these things yes verily he
taketh true and perfect notice of them all and his blessednesse
is vexed there with and his good spirit is grieved and the holy
seed is greatly oppressed Even as a cart is pressed with sheaves, and
now there is heard a deep and Lamentable morunfull cry sounded in
the Eares of its tender Father because of these things.</p>
               <p>Oh my burthen, my burthen, my greife, my greife, my lamentation,
my lamentation, my sorrow, my sorrow, my Mourning, my Mourning,
yea my very soul dwells in heavinesse and I am even bowed down
down down, my tears are many my sighes are very deep my
Groans are very heavy my travell is in the depths of sorrow,
concerning thee, O thou beloved City part of whose walls are
broken down yea and verily the Enemie shall and will be suffered
to pray upon thee because of the great Iniquitie that is found
amonst many in thee. Oh gird on sackcloath and sit in ashes ye
carlesse daughters that are therein, and morun and weep yea waile
and lament that so the Lord in mercy may yet return and for
his own blessed name sake and the seed of his covenant have
mercie upon you and show kindnesse to you before the day of your
