            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

olde men loue it, and are therefore called Penny-Fathers:
Trades-men loue it, for they cry, Take it

but a Penny to crosse the Water, and when a man
hath not a Penny in his purse, then he sweares hee
hath not one crosse about him. So that as a Penny
is the least Crosse that a man can carry, there can
be no greater crosse than for a man to goe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

her whole body (to the eye of his imagination) appeared

at this her admirable loue, and vnfaigned expressions of
a noble Wife, pluck'd off his ragges, and vnder them
discouered a faire habite; but entreating her, to pardon
his absence for an houre or two, for the dispatch of a most

               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> then richly attiring himselfe, and taking

and his lips an 100. kisses, and telling him that a base

Rascall, in shape of a Begger, came to her, and tooke his
name vpon him. That very Begger, swéetest Mistresse
(quoth <hi>Ferdinand)</hi> was I my selfe, and came to you in
that pouerty, to try if you would reléeue mee, but it was
an easre matter for you to scorne me, as not knowing me
in that loath some apparence, I therefore pardon it; and
to shew, how déepely (euen in absence) you were printed
in my memory, and that you are to me the same beloued
Mistris, that heretofore you haue bin; behold, as a part of
my good Uoyage, I present to your white hands this rich
Cabinet, full of the most pretious Iewels, that are to be

her hands to lay hold vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. But (quoth he) my most

            <p>Hereupon, shee fetches all the braueries, and costly

Begger, at his returne to his Ship, when they went a

and serued him well to for so little money) had done him
a great deale of good since his Arriuall, and that to the
last day of his life, hee would be a faire gayner by the

            <p>But then the Marriner, who counterfaited the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
not being able to glew vp his lips any longer, tolde
them all, that hee was that Rag-a-muffin, who begg'd
an Almes on the shoare, onely to put his Captaine in
minde of his Wife, and her Penny, because hee knew
how the single Penny was deliuered, and therefore in
his Beggerly Oration to him, hée touch'd him to the
quicke, as knowing into how many wilde and crooked
currents the streame of his Captaines life had runne;
yet if this bolde attempt of his had succéeded well, hée
hoped his offence, was the more easily pardoned. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
(quoth <hi>Annabell!)</hi> yes, and rewarded too: and
thereupon, remembring and putting her Husband in
minde of his owne words in Bed to her, which were,
that but for the aduice the supposed Begger gaue him for

<hi>Caleb</hi> (our subtill Iew) perceiuing <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to be an

reaped, nor from whose Sheafes he stole (were it but a

a goodly heape of counterfet Iewels, (as faire to the eye,
as any that were worne in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the falshood not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
to be found out, but by a very cunning workman) hée
liked them so well, that being wondrous importunate to
buy them, albeit the Iew held them at an vnreasonable
rate, yet he had them for Time, a Bond being drawne
to pay to <hi>Mosolomon,</hi> double the value, if he had not his
mony iust vpon the day. The match pleased them both,
the Iew laughed in his sléeue, to see how hee had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hastned to his Italian Hen-Sparrow, to shew what
costly and glorious Feathers he had bought to stick her
with; the Iewels were with thousands of thanks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
and as many kisses payd backe to him on his lips,
which he accepted as a sufficient satisfaction.</p>
            <p>The day of payment for these Iewels being come,
the Iew (as busie as a Kite ouer his prey) soares ouer

it should neuer from his arme, so long as there was any
