            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

he was my father, I thought he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Now let vs come vnto God. You say you beleeue in God the Father, &amp; by that name you call vpon him, saying: Our Father which art in heauen, and so forth.

               <p>Then if you want any thing, you fly vnto God alone, and you doubt not at all but that hee will giue you all things bountifully. What? Doubt yee? why an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer you not my <hi>Lewis?</hi>

               <p>Now God hath promised not 300. crownes, but all things that you haue need of, and yet you distrust him.</p>

Which thing, that you may the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, consider the force of worldly beliefe.<note place="margin">The force of worldly faith, and how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully it moueth men.</note> A man beleeues that riches are good, and that it is possible for him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to it by merchandise.

For the full &amp; mighty faith or beliefe, is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Saints haue subdued kingdomes, wrought righteousnes, obtained the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and done such other things as any man may wonder to think of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Therefore whereas men doe commonly challenge faith to themselues, and yet liue in all kinde of wickednesse, they lye, and haue not the true faith, but a dead one, which is no more worthy of the name of faith then a dead man is worthy of the name of a man. That this is not faith indeede, Christ himselfe sheweth suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently when he saith, that at his comming hee shall not finde faith vpon the earth.

I require not here bodily myracles, which were appoynted to the first trayning of the Church vnto faith:<note place="margin">To what purpose bodily my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are wrought.</note> But the thing that I require, is, that he which beleeueth in Christ should breed the same vertues in other men, which God hath bred in him: that is to say, that of drunkards, he should make them sober: of lecherous, chaste: of irefull, milde: and at a word, of vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, righteous,<note place="margin">The diuels that lurk within vs, and what is meant by speaking with new tongues.</note> For, to cast out Diuels, is to cast out the vices of lecherie, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, wrathfulnesse, &amp; such other. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to speake with new tongs, is to speake with fiery &amp; burning speech, such as no man can withstand; of which sort theirs is, which speake the things, not which they haue heard, but which they haue seen with their eies, heard with their eares, and felt with their hands: that is to say, which they haue printed throughly in their hearts, &amp; which they do as verily beleeue, as you do verily beleeue that it is now day, or

If a man haue not these things himselfe, he can conuey them into others: I see not by what right he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> claime faith, vnlesse it bee the faith which the Diuels haue, who do beleeue that there is a God, and do quake at him.

               <p>Let vs consider then whether the same cause bee not an impediment to our beliefe in Christ. In the doctrine of Christ are histories, promises, and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. As for the histories, and promises, almost all men beleeue them, because that in them no duty on mans behalfe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Neither is there any controuersie among Christians,<note place="margin">There is no boubt among Christians co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the doings of Christ:</note> whether Christ haue done the things which are reported of him in the holy Scriptures, or whether he haue promised the things that are contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there. But what is the cause that so few beleeue his commandements?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lew.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Do fewer folke beléeue his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, then do beléeue his doings and promises?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Fred.</speaker>
               <p>Doubt you of that? First, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Gods commandements, whereas our maisters vniuersally be wont to teach, that they be not set downe to the intent we should obey them, but to make vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our infirmities: what else is it then a discrediting of Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For seeing our Lord hath said, that all things are possible to him that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth: and <hi>Paul</hi> saith, he is able to doe all things through him that strge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>thneth him:
<pb facs="tcp:25342:19"/>
surely that man which not onely obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not Gods commandements,<note place="margin">What is the cause that so few beleeue Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> but also beleeueth that it is vnpossible to obey them, doth not beleeue the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments aright.

               <p>
                  <hi>But this saying which you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, namely, that all things are possible to the beléeuer, séemeth to bee spoken of myracles, and not obedience.</hi>

               <p>It is spoken generally of all the workes of faith which I spake of in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that place of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> Through faith the Saints con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered kingdomes, wrought righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp;c.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding are not of the necessity of their salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: much more is it his will that they shold by the same faith be able to obey his commandements; seeing that without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience a man cannot be saued: and that to obey is not a harder matter then to work myracles; and yet that to obey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to all beleeuers: whereas to work

                  <hi>Indeede these things are true</hi> Fredericke, <hi>but yet there remaineth one thing which I would faine haue opened vnto me. You said euen now, that all men beleeue Christs histories, but not his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For no doubt but if they beleeued that Iesus Christ is risen from the dead, in so doing they should both beleeue that he is the very sonne of God indeed, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer giue credit to all his sayings. In which respect</hi> Iohn <hi>said: These things are written to the intent yee might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue that Iesus is the annoynted sonne of God; and that through beleeuing it, yée should obtaine life by his name.</hi>

               <p>Whereas I deny that they beleeue his commandements, I would not haue it so taken, as though they beleeued not that his commanding of those things was well, and as became the sonne of God to doe: but that forasmuch as they beleeue not that the things which he commanded

               <p>And soothly so they be <hi>(Lewis)</hi> in very deede. For in the very same place God calleth them vnbeleeuers in these words: How long will this people spite me? How long will it be ere they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me, for all the miracles which I haue wrought among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Now if these be iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called vnbeleeuers, the same reason lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs to call the others vnbeleeuers, and distrusters of Christs commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, forasmuch as they do no lesse mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construe the precepts of Christ, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites did the commandements of God. For Christ hath not wrought fewer mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to vs, then <hi>Moses</hi> did to them. Neither did Christ command vs lesse ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to subdue sin, then God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to subdue the Canaanites. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we lesse spiteful &amp; distrustful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, if we deny that sin may be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, when as hee both commandeth vs, and promiseth vs strength; then they were spitefull and distrustfull towards
<pb facs="tcp:25342:21"/>
God, in denying it to be possible to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Canaanites. Neither do we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend lesse against the meaning of Christ, when we deny that it is either possible for vs, or meant by Christ, that wee should do the things which he hath commanded vs to doe, then the Israelites offended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the meaning of God, when they wrested it another way then his open words imported. And therefore in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them to beleeue Christs comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, I do them no wrong. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place of <hi>Iohn</hi> by you alledged,<note place="margin">How the place taken out of Iohn is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</note> it is to be taken as if a man should haue said at that time to the Israelites, GOD hath wrought these miracles for your sakes in Aegypt, to the intent you should beleeue, and by beleeuing, enter into the resting place of Canaan. But the cause why all of them came not there, was not Gods purpose, but their owne hardening of their hearts against him: which thing would God were not done in Christ also. But we see it is so: howbeit the Author of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> warneth vs not to do it, citing this saying out of a certaine Psalme:<note place="margin">Psalm. 95.8</note> 
                  <hi>To day if ye heare his voyce, harden not your hearts, as your forefathers did harden

theirs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Selfe loue dazeleth mens eyes that they cannot see to beleeue the truth.</note> Therefore to returne againe to the matter: Whereas these men are wont so diligently to picke out the things to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, which belong to the office of God, &amp; to refuse the things that pertaine to the duty of man, I pray you what a dealing is it?

Many beleeue that Christ hath so perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that poynt, as that wee neede not to performe the same. Againe, that the man is blessed to whom the Lord imputeth no sinne, is easily beleeued of all men: but as for that which is annexed to it, namely, and in whose heart there is no guile, that they beleeue to be impossible. Likewise, it is commonly vaunted with full mouth, that they which are in Christ Iesus, are not subiect to any condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for it is a very sweete saying indeed: but as for this, <hi>Which walke not after the flesh, but after the spirit,</hi> it is bitter, and of very fewe beleued. And (to make fewe

words) men doe easily beleeue that they shall reape with ioy: but if you tell them that they must sow with teares, they put that sentence ouer vnto Christ.<note place="margin">What is the cause why false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets do easily finde credit.</note> Hereupon it cometh to passe, that the false prophets, because they teach delectable things, and blaze abroad Gods pleasa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t promises with open mouth, do easily finde credit: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the true Prophets, because they vrge men, &amp; make them afraid with threats, &amp; teach the truth seuerely, do beare sway a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong very few; according as <hi>Esay</hi> crieth out: Lord who hath beleeued our prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching?

                  <note place="margin">Euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s own flesh is a harlot, of whom he warneth men to take very good heede.</note> Thus then standeth the case. Euery mans owne flesh is as a harlot (as <hi>Iudas</hi> termeth it in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle,) yea and a painted harlot, which with her enticements and faire faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, doth allure, delight, and egge the man to sinne, and hold him downe in sin, and at length throwe him downe into death of the soule. And man being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the poyson, embraceth the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and yeeldes himselfe ouer to them. Now commeth in truth as a friend vnto him, and warneth him that the wages of sinne is death, declaring vnto him that
<pb facs="tcp:25342:24"/>
his flesh whom he tooke to haue bene his friend,<note place="margin">Most wholsome counsel, &amp; worthy to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> is his deadly enemy. Therefore if thou desire to be saued, thou must beleeue that thou hast not a more noysome enemy to thee then thy selfe, that is to say, then thy flesh, or thy lustfulnes; &amp; that as thou hast hitherto loued it, thou must he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceforth hate it &amp; resist it, because it is noysome &amp; deadly. And although thou canst not rid away her allurements out of hand, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede thou canst not, for they sticke fast to thee: the truth will say vnto thee, as it said in old time vnto <hi>Moses</hi>; Goe thy way into Aegypt (for it lyeth in thee to doe that) and I will bee with thy mouth, and I will enable thee to doe that which thou canst not do. Euen so <hi>Lewis,</hi> the truth saith vnto thee as now: Do thou what thou art able, and God will ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee to doe that which thou canst not do. As for examples sake. Thou sittest at a well furnished table, and hast eaten i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough already to refresh thy powers, and to staunch hunger. Now there is brought in some delicate dishe, made to prouoke gluttony withall. By and by thy flesh is tempted with it, and putteth such an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination as this in thy head: This is a
<pb facs="tcp:25342:24"/>
fine dish, if I eate of it, I shall receiue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by it. But the spirit striueth against the flesh, and warneth thee thus: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware <hi>Lewis,</hi> that thou yeeld not vnto vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuousnesse, for voluptuousnesse is a poysoner.<note place="margin">The inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable harmes that come of pleasure.</note> For first, it calleth away thy mind from God, than the which there can be no greater mischiefe: for seeing that no man can serue two maisters, thou canst not serue both voluptuousnes &amp; God; because voluptuousnesse ouerwhelmeth the mind, beareth it downe to the ground, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth it from God. Besides this, it also hurteth the body with surfetting, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that although thou hadst no soule, yet oughtest thou to abstaine from super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity, euen for thy bodies sake. I require not now that you should not be tempted with the inticements of the flesh, but that you should not obey them. And whereas you alledge that you cannot but obey the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you be easily disproued. For if a man would giue you a floren to abstein fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the said dish, would you not absteine? (Yes.) And will you not absteine by reason of the truth? Do you not hereby bewray, that the truth beareth lesse sway with you then one floren? Or if some man should
<pb facs="tcp:25342:25"/>
threaten that he would giue you a blow on the eare if you refrained not: surely you would refraine. Behold God threatneth a blow vnto your soule, and yet you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine not.

Oftentimes when hee would sleepe, he must watch if his maister com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him: when he would goe abroade, hee must tarry at home: when hee would play he must worke: and (at a word) he so forgoeth his owne freedome, that if he be asked what he will do, or what he min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to do, he must answer, what his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster listeth, at whose appointment hee is. So we (if wee belong to Christ, who hath bought vs at a great price,) are not at our owne disposition or appoyntment, but at Christs: and therefore wee must doe, not what we list, but what he listeth; and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily. For if hee, being the way and the truth, did notwithstanding so submit his will to the will of his Father, that he said, Not my will be done, but thine: what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh it vs to do, which are ouer coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with errours and leasings? Therefore when you be about to bee angry without cause, you must restraine your anger at the appoyntment of Christ. When you would giue your selfe to voluptuousnesse, you must absteine, and giue your selfe to sorrowing. When you would bee auen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

of any body, you must forgiue him. When you would doe a man harme, you must doe him good. When you would laugh, you must weep. When you would sue for honour, you must endure shame. When you would seeke riches, you must suffer pouerty.

And all these things shal you do through faith: for vnlesse you beleued, you would not do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But it is necessary to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, what is meant by this saying of S. <hi>Paules,</hi> that we must proceede from faith to faith. There is a certaine first and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect beliefe, whereby a man is moued to renounce himselfe. This being once kindled, becommeth daily greater by a mans holding on, vntill at length hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so farre, that he doth as certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue all Gods sayings, commandements, promises, and threatnings: as you beleeue that the day shal succeed the night. Hence springeth that almightie power of faith, wherethrough it is able to remoue moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines: so as there is no pride, no couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, no lecherie, nor (to be short) no vice
<pb facs="tcp:25342:28"/>
so huge and great, which that faith is not able to put away, and to plucke vp by the roote. Howbeit ere euer a man attaine to that strength, hee is to endure many hard things in the way of his forsaking of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; and without such hardnesse there is no accesse to be had to that strength; like as a figge or a grape cannot become sweet except it be first sowre. And because I my selfe haue not yet attained the victory, but do yet still sweate in the incounter of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking my selfe, and as yet am farre off from the garland: I will say no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the victory, that is to say, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the thing which is vnknowne to me: but yet as much as I can, I will helpe you (by Gods grace) in the incounter, if you wil be my companion.</p>
