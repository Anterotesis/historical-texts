            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'TIs matter of just amazement, that sin so wretched in its nature, so pernicious in its issues; should yet obtain so vast, so general an Interest all over the world.</p>
            <p>This great dishonour thus apparently done as well to <hi>Reason,</hi> as <hi>Religion,</hi> must certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be attributed to the common depravedness of mankinde, to the naughtiness of our own hearts, which (in this collapsed conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ours) are now carnal, and sold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sin. Or (as <hi>Solomon</hi> expresseth it) <hi>fully set in us to do evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the better redress whereof, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving erected those solemn ordinances <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy,</hi> and <hi>Ministry,</hi> hath put this matter into both their Commissions; making it an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent part of their work in their several

sphears, to give all due rebukes to <hi>vice,</hi> all due encouragements to <hi>vertue;</hi> as the proper direct method both to civil, and sacred wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>
            <p>Such hath been the gracious care of God in our behalf. Every good man must, and will heartily say, <hi>Amen; Oh let this righteous pleasure of the Lord prosper in their hands.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Severe declaiming against present times, may be in some cases not so much the fruit of piety, as of pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishness. A querulous ingratitude towards God, and as unhandsome disingenuity towards men.</p>
            <p>'Tis a caution justly given by <hi>Solomon; say not, what is the cause that the former days were better then these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.</hi> Eccl. 7. 10. Certain it is, the world
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50848:4"/>
hath its frequent vicissitudes in morals, as well as in naturals. It hath had its open alternations and seasons of sinking sometimes into viece and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering it self again at other times to some compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent degrees of vertue; else we had long since come to those sad <hi>Hercules</hi> pillars whereof the Poet so saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically speaketh,
<q>
                  <p>Non habet ulterius quod nostris moribus addat posteritas.â</p>
               </q>
Sin had long ago risen to its utmost <hi>Zenith,</hi> its ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest growth and height, beyond which it could have proceeded no further.</p>
            <p>But still though some ages may have the happy lot of appearing as a hopeful spring after a dead winter: yet others prove as a declining autumn after a more fruitful summer. The succession of ages 'tis very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten like that of families. If a pious <hi>Iosiah</hi> comes forth after a wretched <hi>Amon;</hi> 'tis as true a wicked <hi>Manas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seh</hi> may succeed a righteous <hi>Hezechiah.</hi> This decay touching these last days, 'tis not only the conplaint of the vulgar (where we have many times as much passion, as judgement) but the deep sense and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of all impartiall serious persons, that <hi>iniquity abounds, and the love of manywaxeth cold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have in this and the next Chapter our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours memorable prediction both of the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and of the end of the <hi>world,</hi> The former as some Embleme, and adumbration of the latter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50848:4"/>
Plain it is from all writers, scarce any judgement (in many circumstances) fuller of consternation then that which befell these hard hearted <hi>Iews</hi> for their rejection of <hi>Christ,</hi> Their sin 'twas dearly bought, dearly paid for.</p>
            <p>That kingdom which had sometime appeared as <hi>Princess among the provinces;</hi> that City which had been so honourably stiled, <hi>the joy and beauty of the whole earth;</hi> that Temple which <hi>Tacitus</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth a structure of most immense magnificence and riches; one of the just wonders of the world (as others call it) for all exquisitness and splendour; loe, now people and kingdom, City and Temple, all these goodly buildings laid together under one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ruinous heap. And if <hi>Iosephus</hi> (their own histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian) may be believed,

               </q>
Travellers passing by could scarce see or say; <hi>here was once Ierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The stones of emptiness, and line of confusion were now truly enough stretch't upon it. <hi>Turnus Rufus</hi> (that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, that <hi>Wicked wretch,</hi> as the Jewish writers with indignation call him) had now drawn a plough in scorn over that very place, where formerly the Temple stood. Fulfilling lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally what was (in all probability neither believ'd nor fear'd though) so expressly foretold; <hi>Zion for your sake shall be plowed as a field, and</hi> Jerusalem <hi>shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house, as the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50848:5"/>
high places of the forrest, Mich.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
            <p>Thus was the admired <hi>Naomi</hi> become now ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Marah.</hi> The joyous City and people made a sad spectacle of astonishment, a second <hi>Shilo,</hi> a pillar of salt, a terrour and warning to all.</p>
            <p>Men and Brethren! let us not deceive our selves, sin 'tis no trifle, nor can God be mocked. He that spared not <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> how shall he spare us, if we tread under foot the things that belong to our peace?</p>
            <p>The Text 'tis one of those previous signes, which should forerun <hi>Ierusalems</hi> ruine. Many whereof (as <hi>Aretius</hi> very well observes) <hi>Ad diem judicii quoque ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodari possint,</hi> they do as well suit with, and may as safely be applyed to, these last days of the world, as those of <hi>Ierusalems</hi> fall. So that we may too truly say; this day is this Scripture fulfilled, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity aboundeth and the love of many waxeth cold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iniquity,</hi> that is, (taking the word as <hi>Grotius</hi> in a restrictive sense) the iniquity of persecutions, the continuance and encrease of their savage cruelties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christians. Such a bloody trade did the Devil then drive in those primitive perfecutions. Oh what abundant cause of thankfulness to God have we! to whom Divine providence hath reserved milder times, times of serenity and freedom in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Christian religion. May we be wise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to soberness, and make a right improvement of our mercies.</p>
            <p>Or <hi>2dly, Iniquitie,</hi> that is (say others) those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold scandals, which not long after did arise, some
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50848:5"/>
from the persons seducing, such as <hi>Benchochab,</hi> that false son of the stars, with his wilde rabble after him: some from the numerous heaps of persons se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, crying <hi>loe here, and loe there!</hi> in a meer phrenzy of delusion; whereby the lustre of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church became greatly ecclipsed, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes (no doubt) unhappily cool'd, and taken off from the due embracement of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Such sad spectacles (both the one and the other) have most ages afforded: so prone have some been to believe a lie. And so unable have others been, to step over this stone of offence, and to continue (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this sore temptation) a sober constant love to deserted, slighted truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> And lastly, <hi>Iniquitie,</hi> that is, taking the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression (as some others) at a greater latitude, it then importeth, <hi>Communem naturae humanae pravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> the common pravity of humane nature. As if our Saviour had said, this as another <hi>Nilus</hi> shall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow all its banks.
<q>
                  <l>Exiliet fraenis Natura remotis.</l>
               </q>
The reins being laid loose, mankinde shall be seen to run even wilde into all excess of vice: <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that is, 'twill not be the bare subsistence and being of sin, but sin multiplyed and encreased: measures of iniquity heaped, and running over; sin rampant, with all circumstances of hainousness accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: fulfilling that ancient similitude of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; <hi>the press is full, the fats overflow, their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness is great, Ioel.</hi> 3. 13.</p>

            <p>We have in the words (without any labour of more curious division) the cause and effect, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent and consequent, all of the same sad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; sin upon sin, and misery upon misery as devouring waves immediately following one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Iniquity shall abound, and the love of many shall wax cold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the verse as it stands capable of a various aspect, we have several weighty truths emergent, such as may sadden us, but such as must also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Looking upon the words in their causality and influence they bear, the former to the latter, we may thence observe; the growth and encrease of sin, 'tis an extreme prejudice and hindrance to all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Looking upon the words as they stand in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture with the times they point unto, we may
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50848:6"/>
then observe; <hi>All those seasons when people both might and should be best, it may so fall out, that they prove then far worst.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The last view of the words is in some respects yet sadder; Looking on them as one of the previous signes of <hi>Ierusalems</hi> destruction, they plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; <hi>The encrease of sin, the decay of piety, they are things fatal and ominous to any people, presages of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending calamity,</hi> where these go before we may justly fear the tragical sequels they here relate to. <hi>Then shall there be great tribulation. vers.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Looking upon the words in that causality and influence the former bear to the latter, we may thence observe, the growth and increase of sin, 'tis an extreme prejudice and hindrance to all goodness. <hi>Because iniquitie shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold;</hi> sin, 'tis as the weeds in the field, their encrease impairs the whole crop of corn; or as that venemous tree the <hi>Arcadian Yew-tree;</hi> which (as <hi>Plinie</hi> relates) casteth a deadly killing shade; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing kindly thrives wherever that spreads its branches. That men as men, owe to God a life of vertue, and as Christians a life of more transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent piety; all our hearts, and indeed the whole world must freely yield, and Eccho, <hi>Yes.</hi> But alas? where sin sets up its hellish standard, how shall this be performed? Humane nature is weak and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple proves more then whole loads of arguments, <hi>Pecorum ritu antecedentium gregem sequimur, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentes non quÃ  sit eundum sed quÃ  itur;</hi> said <hi>Seneca</hi> very truly; we are like sheep following the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tract of others, though never so far out our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50848:7"/>
way: principles of good are but faint and weak e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the best: when the iron age comes on indeed, the next news is,
<q>
                  <l>Vict a jacet pietas.</l>
               </q>
Vice goes up, and the sacred interest of vertue that goes as fast down.</p>
            <p>Dayly experience sheweth it in things natural. Contraries (we say) abide not together. They are of a contending nature; the one chaseth away the other. Thus where darkness cometh, light is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to go: Thus where the extremity of cold pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth, the more desirable warmth and heat are lost. The case, 'tis parallel in a diviner sense: after this manner (saith the <hi>Apostle)</hi> doth sin <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. It fighteth, and fighteth in earnest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the whole interest of holiness. It seems to cry out againg piety, as the <hi>Edomites</hi> did against <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem; Rase it, rase it, even to the ground.</hi> Let but evil once get up, and that will quickly bring down whatever is good. Where the one usurps the other becomes dethroned.</p>
            <p>To be truly religious in the best times 'tis much, but to be such in bad times, 'tis almost a miracle: If <hi>ill words</hi> be enough (as the <hi>Apostle</hi> observes) <hi>to corrupt good manners;</hi> ill words, and ill works put both together, are much more able to do it. In such a common degeneracy one <hi>Lot,</hi> one <hi>Noah</hi> is a great raritie in Gods own reckoning. <hi>Thee</hi> (that is thee only) <hi>have I seen righteous before me in this generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Gen.</hi> 7. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:50848:7"/>
To put the case into a familiar way of instance; when Atheism and contempt of religion shall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reign, how shall an ingenuous person (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out very much conflict in himself) be able to bear up any due acknowledgments of God in all his ways? when almost all places shall run into drunkeness and excessive healths, how shall the most sober person contain himself within the due bounds of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? when uncleanness and all manner of wanton lusts shall appear Epidemical, impudent, and as the sin of <hi>Sodom;</hi> how hard is it then to observe and honour chastity as it ought? when people shall every where become effeminate and fond in their attire, how loth shall we be to expose our selves to the scorn of others, by continuing a plain, decent modest habit? when profane swearing shall grow the common dialect, how prone will our own lips be to take up those unhappy accents? when every novell wilde opinion, shall grow the more creditable reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, who can then (without very much grace,) steadily consist with ancient sound doctrine? Lastly (to ask no more of these fadning questions) when debauchedness and drollery shall grow the only gentile mode, oh how ready shall we all then be, to grow ashamed of holiness and the fear of God? Thus may a righteous cause become oppressed, and religion it self even laught to scorn through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies of sin.</p>
            <p>Under such hard circumstances, the best of men may be prone to fall into such convulsive fits, as one sometimes expressed; Ah! <hi>quoties mecum dixi numquid ego solus sapio?</hi> &amp;c. It is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50848:8"/>
language of many a good mans heart; Lord! <hi>my judgment is satisfied, my affection setled; I could truly say; methinks no life like a life of serious pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But when I look abroad into the world, I see 'tis far otherwise: Lo, there, rioting and drunkenness, chambering and wantoness, strife and envying. And these things, I must confess, almost quench and cool all my former willing thoughts for heaven: I could often lay my hand upon my heart, and say; what? am I wiser, am I better then others? who, or what do I take my self to be?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh my Brethren! A holy life it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its difficulties; Lo, here the snare unseen, the temptation that presseth so hard upon the most candid persons; They are many times bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inwardly then they know to shew themselves outwardly; Others are bad, and this maketh them half ashamed to be good: Loth they are to disoblige, loth to do any thing, which might seem to reflect on the vices of others. And this maketh us still at our former loss; sin depresseth better things: When that is at its highest <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick,</hi> Religion is usually then at its lowest.</p>
            <p>We commonly say (and the preceding instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are evidence enough of it) that scarce any man sinneth singly to himself alone: he becomes a snare and danger to others. At this unhappy rate have the overflowings of ungodliness in these last days drowned many. The devils work proves done to his hand. Ingentious natures become dayly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd, hopeful inclinations immediately blast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, green unpoiz'd years easily drawn aside. And
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50848:8"/>
all this through the common encrease of sin. Thus as the <hi>Poet</hi> said, is <hi>Astraea</hi> driven away; or rather thus may we say, is <hi>Piety</hi> weakned and wounded amongst us.</p>
            <p>Honoured and Beloved! the consideration it is momentous, it is truly great and weighty, it cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth upon us all in our several places, to be real and earnest for the suppressing of evil, lest other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that pulleth down whatever is good: our kindness to sin, it is our unkindness to God. So far as we countenance vice, so far we frown upon vertue; and tread under foot whatever is honest, whatever is lovely, whatever is praiseworthy in the sight of God, or men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> Looking upon the words as they stand in conjuncture with the times they point to, we may then observe; <hi>At those seasons when people both might and should be best, it may so fall out that they prove then far worst.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may look upon the present arraignment as relating either to the sins of the <hi>Iews</hi> or of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> 'Tis the same truth we have, the same equal grounds for the observation in both.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reference to the Jews:</p>
            <p>'Twas Gods complaint in the prophet; <hi>When I would have healed</hi> Israel, <hi>then the iniquity of</hi> Ephraim <hi>was discovered, Hos.</hi> 7. 1. An extreme improper season. The accent of time <hi>when,</hi> made the offence sevenfold the greater. 'Twas sin very ill timed. Such was <hi>Ierusalems</hi> case. The <hi>Messiah</hi> was now come, on this very design, <hi>That he might destroy the works of the devil,</hi> the darkness was now pass't,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50848:9"/>
and the true light shining, life and immortality (those dear desirable things) brought now to light. The times of former ignorance God had winked at: but now call'd upon all men every where to repent. The <hi>Apostles</hi> (those blessed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of state) ready at hand to assist in this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly work. A definitive time prefixt, (as in the <hi>Ninevites</hi> case) yet within a few years, or it would be too late. Temple and City, and People, would all lie under ashes, if the sore threatned judgment were not prevented by a religious speedy turning to God.</p>
            <p>But lo, after all, in stead of grapes, behold wilde grapes, in stead of holiness to the Lord, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth (as the <hi>Apostle</hi> relateth their case) far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise; <hi>A filling up their sins that wrath might come upon them to the uttermost, 1 Thes.</hi> chap. 2. ver. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ierusalem</hi> that very people to whom Christ had so divinely preach't; <hi>Never man spake like this man, Iohn</hi> 7. 46. that very people over whom he had so pathetically mourned, <hi>And when he was come near, he beheld the City and wept over it, Luk.</hi> 19. 41. that very people for whom after all their indignities, and in the midst of all his own extremest Agonies, he yet so affectionately prayed, <hi>Father, forgive them for they know not what they do, Luk.</hi> 23. 34. that very people toward whom his bowels had always so particularly, so tenderly yearned, <hi>Oh Ierusalem, Ierusalem! how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as an hen gathereth her chickens? Math.</hi> 23. 37. yet this, this
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50848:9"/>
very people, as if uncapable of being obliged by all the methods of love and sweetness; nothing can rellish, nothing seems to take with them but sin and hell: <hi>Iniquity abounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men and Brethren! who can conceive how far the hopefullest persons, the fairest seasons may fall short of divine expectation? 'Twas <hi>Ierusalems</hi> case, it was their sin, 'tis our danger.</p>
            <p>Or <hi>2dly,</hi> If we take the words as relating to the sin of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the aggravation is still the same. now was their <hi>Accepted time,</hi> now was their <hi>Day of salvation.</hi> Now were those wilde branches to be ingrafted with so much honour into the good Olive: Divine grace, hitherto so great a stranger to them, and they to that, sought now for their embraces, this was their heavenly nuptiall day, <hi>Lo</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>we turn to the Gentiles;</hi> that is, to carry, and tender to them that kingdom, those treasures of mercy, which you <hi>Iews</hi> so unworthily turn your backs upon, how justly might the worth of the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage make the feet of those holy men who brought these blessed tidings beautiful and welcome to them? yet here also, (as if all flesh were will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully set upon walking contrary to God) we finde the <hi>holy City</hi> troden under foot by these <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and by them polluted with <hi>Idols.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The religious <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was now turned into a prophane <hi>Aelia;</hi> A swines head set up at the gates in derision of the Jews: And (that they might at once bid the more open defiance to Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and give the fullest establishment to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenisme)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50848:10"/>
a temple is set up for <hi>Iupiter</hi> with all Paganish solemnities upon Mount <hi>Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It might have then been said with very little alteration as in the Psalms; The bloud of thy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and primitive Martyrs have they shed like water in the streets; the dead bodies of thy Saints have they given to the beasts of the earth, not only putting them to death but (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> though a heathen confesseth) <hi>Pereuntibus addita ludibria, ut serarum tergis contecti, canum laniatu interirent,</hi> &amp;c. The most barbarous inhumane cruelties (cruelties not fit to be related for their unparallel'd savageness) were frequently added, in the manner of taking away the lives of these holy men; making the Christians extreamest dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing torments their play, their sport, and pastime. So that look which way we will, we have much one and the same joyless prospect still before us, <hi>Iniquity every where aboundeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now may we too justly come from <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> home to our selves: He that should some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time since have asked us here in <hi>England;</hi> If God should put up the sword of blood and war once more into its sheath; If God should pitty our wilde confusions, and restore our ancient rightful Government in peace; If God should recall his destroying Angel, and arrow of noisome pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, sparing a remnant of us as brands pluckt out of the fire; would we after such severe judgements, after such signal mercies wallow as swine in the mire of fin any more? I know we should have answered with indignation, as <hi>Hazael</hi> did to the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50848:10"/>
Prophet; <hi>Is thy servant a dog that I should do this thing?</hi> But, not to dispute that question; we may thankfully say, men we are, not dogs: and yet as dogs have we returned to this vomit.</p>
            <p>Let me (as <hi>Samuel</hi> once said to the <hi>Israelites)</hi> reason a little with you before the Lord in this matter. Can we in cool blood think that we were delivered to commit all these evils? Or that vicious courses carry any thing of a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manlike return to divine goodness for such tender mercies? can we come off at the bar of our own conscience, with any excuse that holdeth water, that beareth worth or weight in it? <hi>Do we thus requite the Lord, Oh foolish people and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise?</hi> Shall good nature and Education teach us better carriage toward men, for kindnesses recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from them, and shall not Religion and grace much more keep us from returning evil for good unto God? Hath <hi>former history</hi> brought such honourable reports to us, of others that have been so eminently good in bad times, and shall <hi>future history</hi> transmit our names with so much disgrace to posterity, for being as wrechedly bad in good-times? Oh that this danger and reproach might be rolled from us.</p>
            <p>What we might and should be, under those manifold advantages and mercies which (blessed be God) we comfortably enjoy, our own consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are able to inform us. What we are, it is matter of amazement to most that know or hear of us.</p>

If heretofore times have been shamelesly dissolute, it is now much more. The foundations themselves are very far out of course. 'Tis become with many open A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism toward God; the Almightly himself is not spared. 'Tis become with many meer giddy scepticism in the most fundamental points of faith; that faith which is reverently to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, not rudely or desultoriously to be tossed to and fro. 'Tis become with many common schism and separation from the publick assemblies of the Church. A general irreverence, contempt and scorn of allmost all Government.</p>
            <p>And what too easily follows from such unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward premises, the utmost immoralities of life. Those evils which modest nature would hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have startled at, they grow now the fashion and familiar practice of multitudes, what horrid swearing! the first and chief language that is heard from many children in the open streets: what common drunkenness! what wretched lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness! as if we might abuse our selves, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour our bodies, those bodies, which should be as so many Temples to the holy Ghost, after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fordid sensual rate, as we please.</p>

But still (like the churlish <hi>Quartan Ague,</hi> that stubborn <hi>dedecus medicorum)</hi> as if the disease were too strong for the physick; or our distemper above the means of cure: much so it fareth with us: sin proveth (as those <hi>sons of Zerviah)</hi> too hard for us, it seems to bear no check; but rather

strugleth to get further ground of us. And we must lament together, both Magistrates and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters; whether through defectiveness in us, or through aversenesse and renitencies in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or through the just displeasure of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this whole Age; so it is, the good work of God for the suppressing of vice and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of vertue and pietie, succeedeth but very poorly upon our hands.</p>
            <p>These things are not spoken, that we should as ships in a sea-storm fall fowl one upon another. <hi>God forbid!</hi> Obliquities of this nature were the adding of evil to evil, that our guilt might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come yet greater.

            <p>Thus firmly was this great truth believed, thus openly asserted among the <hi>Heathen</hi> by their own <hi>Poets.

            <p>Religion it is as those sacred ministrations in the Temple; the preservatives of the City. And on the contrary, where the <hi>Holy fire</hi> goeth out: where the <hi>Daily sacrifice</hi> ceaseth; calamity seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

there to follow (as it were) of course.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Abraham</hi> gives over interceding, then <hi>Sodom</hi> burns down to ashes indeed. When <hi>Moses's</hi> hands fall down through faintness, then <hi>Amalck</hi> prevaileth: When there is none found to stand in the gap, then God powreth out his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon <hi>Israel:</hi> When the <hi>Disciples</hi> fall to slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, we may too truly say; then is Satans hour and the power of darkness.</p>
            <p>I confess, we neither need, nor can believe, that every stir and bustle that is preposterously made in the world about Religion, goeth for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al piety in the sight of God. We have all of us more of dross then gold; More of carnal passion and animosity, then of spiritual devotion and zeal for God or Heaven. Religion, 'tis a sacred concern, and must be modestly, not boisterously managed. There is scarce any consideration sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then that of those manifold dismal mischiefs that have been acted from mistakes of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>But still there is such a thing, as a cordate affection, and forwardnesse for Religion; Our bounden duty, and of great price in the sight of God: and wherever this first love is once lost, we may justly fear, Gods Candlestick is in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger of being removed.</p>
            <p>It were extreme arrogance, and disrespect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the common sense of mankinde, for any of us to think, that slights of Religion are safe things. <hi>Italie</hi> (saith the Poet) hath smarted sorely upon this very account;

Our Duty herein 'tis truly great, such as may prove a full employment for the whole soul: but still such, as approveth it self to every mans Conscience in the sight of God.</p>
               <p>We may freely say (as once <hi>Moses,)</hi> What doth God the Lord require of us, but to keep our selves inoffensively clear from the sins of these last days? not waving the good offices of love or kindness due to the persons of any: and yet pertaking in evil with none.</p>
               <p>Like <hi>Cassianus</hi> his Jewel-signet; <hi>Universa quae occurrunt ad sui statum transformat; nullius vero incursibus insigniri potest.</hi> Such should every one of us likewise be. As a seal of Diamond, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fair impressions of virtue (upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion) to others: but (of that firmness, as) not to suffer the least impressions of vice to be made by any means upon our selves.</p>
               <p>How happy, oh how lovely were it! could men be truly brought to this good consistency, rais'd to this harmony with Heaven, settled in this excellency of Spirit, this steadiness of Life! neither superciliously forward, nor yet sinfully fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile: but discreetly Religious. Then neither should <hi>Iniquity abound,</hi> nor Piety decay; then neither should our welfare fly from us, nor those miseries which are the common attendants on sin, hover with such frightful wings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us.</p>
               <p>The general mending of bad times (we must all confess) 'tis a great work; it may be too great for particular persons, and beyond their

Sphear. <hi>Abi frater in cellam, &amp;c.</hi> (as he said) Our private prayers and tears may better become us, then excentrical agitations. But still 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much, that every one might truly do in his place, so much, that could all be fairly perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the whole might soon become happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed. However at the lowest ebb, <hi>Noah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> (all good men) may yet deliver their own souls, when they cannot prevail to save the land.</p>

               <p>Religion is an ancient weather-beaten Ship, that hath successfully out-ridden many a hard Sea-storm, and behold it is still above water: or like those Witnesses in the <hi>Revelation:</hi> Prophane men may rant and huff, they may deride and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solently run over it, supposing that they have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht and slain it: But this kinde of crucifying effecteth little; it hindreth not the promised Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. Our Saviour after his sufferings, and the Witnesses after their slaughter, they both presently revive. And thus Religion after all these rude affronts, after all these vain attempts to eclipse it, usually shineth forth (to the joy of all good men) as the Sun out of a dark cloud with much brighter rays.</p>

               <p>This good care we owe to our selves, and our own preservation; But that is not all; There is somewhat more we still owe to God; <hi>A striving against sin,</hi> Hebr. 12. 4. <gap reason="foreign">
