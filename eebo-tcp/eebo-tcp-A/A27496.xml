            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

hanged the next day) an officer had a cheife hand in, about three
of the clocke 500. entred, and continued an houre or two vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered,
till being marched vpon the key they ſhouted; which
was either in aſſurance of victorie, or to invite the Towne to
their promiſed aſſiſtance, ſome of them had adventured vp to
the Mill mount, and killed the firſt Sentinell, others had entred
upon the bridge; This ſhout being our firſt Allarme, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
run out vnarmed, and was the firſt that cauſed a drumme
to beate, and in that haſte was compelled to take the Main guard,
who were his owne Company, and commanded men from by
guards, theſe were his preſent ſtrength, firſt poſted down ſome
pikes commanded by the Enſigne to make good the bridge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the Muſquetiers could make readie, we met the enemy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their firſt entrie, and finding them reſiſted by a guard of ours,
charged home and ſoone compelled them to retreat. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
immediately releeved his enſigne with Muſquetiers, who
mette not farre from the bridge an other company of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells,
but being in the darke tooke them by their anſwer to bee
friends, untill hee found the contrarie by a ſhot made at him,
which went through the brimmes of anothers hat next him,
aſſoone as we gave fire it proved ſo effectuall, that they inſtantly
ſcattered rnd were chaſed through the ſtreets, leaving their dead
bodies, as ſtumbling blocks in our way; And now my Lord
<hi>Moore</hi> with what horſe hee could make readie came to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſiſtance,
who chaſed the reſidue of them up the hill where they
dropped apace, but where the breach was could not yet be found
till they directed us by their flight, through which 100. eſcaped
and now each Captaine had got together force, and invironed
them in each quarters, and with eaſe laid them on heapes in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
corner, ſo that the ſlaine within the walles and priſoners
taken without were 200. This deliverance the worſt of men
acknowledged to be the hand of God, for had they marched to
the next port, and cut the guard off there, who were moſt ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
A thouſand of their owne men were there ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and wee had beene loſt. 'Twas Gods hand that their ſhouts
gave us the firſt Alarme to our ſafety and their deſtruction.</p>
            <p>In this hot skirmiſh wee loſt few, the moſt being but cheqed
them at their firſt entrance unarmed, to prevent their giving
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64282:3"/>
notice, onely three were loſt in fight. This was the only night (of
any neglected) which the joy of the preſent releife occaſioned,
but for the future, doubled our watches, fourty horſe in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
diviſions ſtill riding the round, and by their often viſits, a
ſentinell had ſcarce time to winke. My Lord <hi>Moore</hi> one night,
and the Governour another, (as ſuperviſours of the whole) have
not failed conſtantly ſince to watch in their owne perſons.
The Enemy without on the South ſide of the Towne, ſeemed to
bee about 3000. who in ſeverall bodies ſtay'd an houre or a
after day, beleeving the Towne to be taken, expecting the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a port, which wee perceiving, and having taken a Piper
of theirs, cauſed him to play very merrily upon one of the plat
formes, and to call out in <hi>Iriſh</hi> that the Towne was theirs; It was
good ſport to ſee them ſhorten the way by leaping ditches, and
running themſelves out of breath, who ſhould bee firſt taken, and
ſo were brought in by tennes.</p>
            <p>This extraordinary bleſſing deſerved a ſpeciall ſolemne
thanksgiving, which wee performed two dayes after. A faire
wind inviting the Pinnace next day to returne, paſt with as many
Prayers for ſafety, by the Souldiers on the walles, as ſhee had
beene received with prayſes; But a ſmall fiſher boate, as a Iuſt
Iudgement of God for the former nights worke, by unskilfulneſſe
of the Pilat ranne a ground, and that night, was taken by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
with 14. priſoners.</p>
            <p>Alſo about 3. Miles of at <hi>Mormame</hi> Towne the Pinnaſſe fel
into the like hazard being moſt falſely left by the ſhallops to
the mercy of the Enemy, who played upon her on both ſides,
100. of the Rebels under the ſhelter of Cart loads of furſe, deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
approached ſo neere that they got under the ſterne, and
with crowes and pick-axes beganne to bulge her, where neither
pike nor muſquet could offend them. In this ſtraight Captaine
<hi>Studvild,</hi> (who hath much deſerverved) in the adventure of
releiving us twice threw ſome granadoes amongſt them, they
endured the breaking of ſix, but when the ſeaventh was caſt,
they runne away, and never attempted their deſigne after, the
number of the ſlaine is uncertaine, but by the mighty ſtreame
of bloud, it is conjectured to bee about 60. Whil'ſt wee ſaw
this danger wee ceaſed not in publique to pray for her ſafety,
whoſe loſſe was likely to bee our ruine; This night, ſhee was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64282:4"/>
freed into the Poole, and on the Monday morning, with a faire
wind, bad us farewell.</p>
            <p>Wee had an other Friggat, which aſſiſting the Pinnaſſe in
the burning of ſome barques, ranne the ſame caſualtie, and lay
under the ſame advantage to the Enemy, who having made <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

breſt-worke played upon her all night, but returned without
any harme, ſave the loſſe of one man; Many drummes were ſent
by the Rebels for exchange of Priſoners, till theirs here being
ſpent, they were forced to ſend for more to <hi>Aragh,</hi> and yet

Rebels wee ſaw, was to ſtarve us, by burning all the corne and
hay within two miles of us; they drew often nigh us in the
darke nights, and in mockery askt our Sentinels, if wee had yet
eaten up our Cabbadge ſtalkes and Horſe hides: and indeed,
famine was ſuch at length with the Common Souldiers, that
Horſes, Dogges, and Cats, were good meat; ſome proviſions (by
ſearching) were found hid in Cellers; This ſufficed not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but wee
were forced to ſally out, which was always bleſt with ſome

and an Enſigne, and tooke an other, and 9. priſoners, one died
as ſo one as hee came to Towne, and being unbuttoned, hee was
