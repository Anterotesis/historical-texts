         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PROPOSALS <hi>to Encreaſe</hi> SEAMEN <hi>for the</hi> Service <hi>and</hi> Defence <hi>of</hi> ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>IT being an undeniable Truth, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Navies heretofore, when they did not require above 10 or 15 Thouſand Men, ſufficiently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o Man Them, and had able Seamen enough to Compleat that Equipage; did not uſe to be Sickly</p>
            <p>It will eaſily be believ'd, That the Infirmities that have attended our Fleet theſe 3 or 4 laſt Years, have aroſe from the Naſtineſs of the many Landmen that have been ſent out of the ſeveral Counties, to be put on Board them. For Remedy whereof, I know no other Right Expedient but the Breeding more Seamen.</p>
            <p>A Worthy Gentleman in a late Treatiſe, offers at a Project for the Manning the Navy, by Obliging ſeveral Perſons, under their ſeveral Circumſtances, to provide ſo many Able Seamen for Their Majeſties Service, or elſe to be ſubject to certain Penalties; and they muſt provide them upon ſuch Terms as they can agree with the ſaid Seamen; and ſtill theſe Seamen, in probability, are but the ſame, that either would have gone voluntarily on Board, or might have been Preſs'd into Their Majeſties Service, and conſequently there will be ſo many the fewer to go on Board voluntarily, or to be Preſs'd, which in effect, is but hiring ſo many of the preſent Seamen.</p>
            <p>Whereas, I humbly conceive, nothing but a Project to Breed Seamen, well Executed, will make this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Glorious upon the Sea.</p>
            <p>I cannot be of the Opinion, as I perceive ſome People are, That a Ship Mann'd with ¾ parts Seamen, and ¼ Landmen; moſt of which cannot forbear Vomiting, nor have the command of their Legs to go upon the Deck and do it over the Gunnel of the Ship, but empty themſelves every way, either between Decks or in the Hold, to the great Annoyance of all the reſt of the Crew, who are hereby expoſed to ſo many Diſeaſes, as have appeared in the late Years Expeditions of the Royal Fleets.</p>
            <p>But I humbly conceive, That if they had left all the raw Landmen aſhore, and gon to Sea with only their Seamen, and ſuch as were Maſters of Sea-Legs and Sea-Stomachs, they might probably have eſcaped the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which were bred on Board by the Naſtineſs of the others, and conſequently have been much better Mann'd; wherefore I will humbly offer two Remedies which, I hope, will ſeem Effectual.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That all Watermen that now by the Inſtitution of their Corporations muſt have but one Apprentice, and that not until they have been 7 Years out of their Time, may take two at leaſt, and take them as ſoon as they pleaſe, after they are out of their Time; and this, I hope, will be no hardſhip upon any Body, becauſe the preſent Freemen will have the immediate Benefit thereby, and Widows, who have but one Servant each, and that Servant Preſs'd into the Fleet, and conſequently are left deſtitute of Maintenance, until the Ship comes to be paid off, may take another Apprentice in the mean time to work for her Livelyhood.</p>
            <p>And tho' it is true, that the Apprentices which ſhall be now taken, will not be big enough to go on Board the Men of War under 3 or 4 Years, yet theſe will ſerve to Row upon the <hi>Thames,</hi> whilſt a gteat many others, who are now kept at home, may be ſpared to go aboard.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That all Ships uſing the Coal-Trade, either to <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Wales,</hi> Coaſtwaies, ſhall carry one Landman for Their Majeſties Service, for every Score of chaldren of Coals that they ſhall take on Board; theſe Landmen to be ſupplied, either by Preſſing, or ſuch as ſhall voluntarily go on Board to learn to be Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and after Six Months being on Board, or ſooner, if it ſhall be thought fit (when they have got Sea-Legs and Sea-Stomachs) to be removed into Their Majeſties Ships of War for Gromets, to receive 18 <hi>s. per</hi> Month for their Pay, at firſt, until they can do a Seamans Labour, and then to have the Pay of Able Seamen.</p>
            <p>In the mean time to be allow'd 4 <hi>d. per Diem</hi> to find themſelves Cloaths, and other 4 <hi>d. per Diem</hi> to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the Maſter of the Collier, towards each Man's Victuals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Maſter another 4 <hi>d. per Diem,</hi> it's preſum'd that he will be no loſer thereby, becauſe he will carry ſo many Seamen the leſs, as will more than countervail that Charge.</p>
            <p>As for Example, It's a general Cuſtom amongſt the Colliers (as I am Inform'd) to carry a Seaman to every Score of Coals of the Ships Burthen; now a Ship of 16 Score, that uſeth to carry 16 Seamen at 6 or 7 <hi>l.</hi> a Man for each Voyage, which is uſually made in 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 Weeks, having 16 Landmen on Board, will abate at leaſt 4 of his Seamen, which at 6 <hi>l. per</hi> Voyage, ſtands him in 24 <hi>l.</hi> Whereas 4 <hi>d. per Diem</hi> towards the Victuals of 16 Men for 10 Weeks, will amount to but 18 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> So that if the Voyage prove 10 Weeks long, yet the Maſter will be a Gainer, by having the Landmen on Board, 5 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> and proportionably more, according to the ſhortneſs of the Voyage. Beſides, they will have the Conveniency of Defending their Ships againſt private Men of War, if they furniſh themſelves well with ſmall Arms.</p>
            <p>Now for the Raiſing the Money for defraying the Charges of 4 <hi>d. per Diem</hi> to each Man for Cloaths, and the 4 <hi>d. per Diem,</hi> which Their Majeſties are to pay for Victuals.</p>
            <p>For as much as the Colliers will have ſome Advantage by the breeding theſe Seamen, as well as their ſhare of the general Benefit that will acrue, by bringing down the preſent extravagant Wages of Seamen, when their number encreaſeth Yearly; and that a ſmall Tax upon Coals, is as inſenſible, as upon any other Commodity whatſoever.</p>
            <p>It is humbly Propoſed, That there ſhould be 1 <hi>s. per</hi> chaldron, <hi>London-</hi>Meaſure, laid upon all Coals ſhipp'd off in all the Ports of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> which being 420000 chaldren, or thereabouts, <hi>per Annum;</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a late Computation, will raiſe 21000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and 1500 Men to be always Maintain'd at Sea at 8 <hi>d. per Diem,</hi> will coſt 18249 <hi>l.</hi> 3 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> ſo there may be 2750 <hi>l.</hi> 16 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d. per Annum,</hi> towards the Charges of Management, which I conceive ſufficient, becauſe the Collectors of the Cuſtoms, will probably be contented to receive and pay the Money to the Men, for a Penny in the Pound; and this Service will require no great Officers; good Boatſwains, Mates, and ſuch kind of Robuſtick Perſons, will be the fitteſt Agents for this Affair, and ſuch will think themſelves well paid with 40 or 50 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> beſides their Charges, which will not be very much over and above the Charges of the Conſtables, and ſuch as ſhall by Warrant of the Juſtice of the Peace, Impreſs and bring down Men to the Ports; where each Agent muſt have a Boat and Boatmen allow'd at ſuch conſtant Sallaries as ſhall be thought convenient by 2 or 3 proper Perſons that ſhall be Conſtituted, to Direct the Affair; of which number, the Author of this Propoſition deſires not to be one, he having already as much of Their Majeſties Buſineſs, under his Care and Management, as he can poſſibly Diſpatch.</p>
            <p>Theſe Two Expedients, being well Executed, in 2 or 3 Years time, there will be no want of Seamen, either for Their Majeſties Ships, or for Merchantmen; the laſt only Supplying Annually 3000 Men, by removing 1500, half Yearly, while the Young Watermen are growing up: And by this means will be prevented the vaſt Charge, at which the Roval Navy lies in Port, every Spring, for want of Sailers to Man Their Majeſties Ships: Beſides, the Cities and Countries will be eaſed of a great many Idle Fellows; nor will Lazy, Sawcy, Debauch'd Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants be ſo plenty, as now they are. For all which Reaſons, if it ſhall not be thought convenient to Raiſe the Money for Breeding up Seamen upon the Coal-Trade, then it may be worth Conſideration, by what other way to raiſe ſo ſmall a Sum to ſupply a Matter ſo much for the Nations Safeguard and Advantage.</p>
