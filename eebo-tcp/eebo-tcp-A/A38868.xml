            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THIS Morning arrived an Expreſs from</hi> Ireland <hi>to Her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, with the Good News of a Total Defeat of the</hi> Iriſh Army, <hi>by Their Majeſties</hi> Forces; <hi>the ſubſtance whereof is as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That on <hi>Sunday</hi> laſt in the Afternoon, about five a Clock, our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my conſiſting of about 23000 Horſe and Foot, fell upon the <hi>Iriſh</hi> at <hi>Angrin,</hi> notwithſtanding they found them drawn out in very good Order: the Enemy conſiſted of about 8000 Horſe, and 19000 Foot. The Diſpute was very ſharp, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> maintaining their ground for above 4 Hours; in which time there was ſcarce one Batallion on either ſide, but were more or leſs engaged. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army in this their laſt Effort, behaved themſelves with great and unexpected Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. But at length by the Conduct of our General, the Diligence of our Officers, and undaunted Reſolution of all our Men, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were forced to give way, and fled in all the Confuſion imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Our Army by this Victory became intire Maſters of their Camp, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> leaving behind them all their Baggage and Proviſion, with nine or ten Pieces of Canon.</p>
            <p>As this was the firſt time that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have ſhewn any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gallantry, ſo by the Bleſſing of Providence upon our Arms, it ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved only to render the Conqueſt more Compleat. Of the Loſs which they ſuſtained, we have in general this Account: That Mon. <hi>St. Ruth,</hi> that Monſter of Cruelty, is killed in this Action; moſt of their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Officers are killed or taken. <hi>Sarcefield</hi> is ſaid to have made his Eſcape by Flight. The Number of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Souldiers ſlain, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be about 5000. Neither was this important Victory obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without ſome conſiderable Loſs on our ſide: Thoſe of any Note, whereof we are as yet informed, were Major-General <hi>Holſtein</hi> killed, Prince <hi>De Hermanſtadt</hi> ſuppos'd mortally wounded, Col. <hi>Herbert</hi> kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; the Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi> who had ſignalized his Courage before <hi>Limerick</hi> the laſt Summer, has received a Wound in this Action, but it is hop'd not mortal. The forementioned Expreſs being ſent away immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Action, the particulars of the Purſuit are not yet arrived: However, the Conſequence of this great Affair, can (under Providence) be no leſs than a Total and Speedy Reduction of that Kingdom to their Majeſties Obedience.</p>
            <p>I ſhall trouble you only with one Remarque more, which as it is amazing in its Circumſtances, ſo it ought not to be paſſed over by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny true <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> without particular Thanks to Almighty God; and that is this preſent Week of Wonders, which by God's Bleſſing, has brought us more particular Intelligences of Extraordinary and Great Succeſſes both at Home and Abroad, than perhaps can be met withal in the whole Annals of Time, <hi>viz.</hi> The D. of <hi>Saxony</hi>'s Paſſing of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in ſight of the <hi>French</hi> Army; The Confirmation of the Relief of <hi>Coni,</hi> The Raiſing of the Blockade of <hi>Monmelian;</hi> The ſafe Arrival of our <hi>Engliſh-Smyrna</hi> Fleet, Our Succeſs at <hi>Athlone;</hi> and to crown all, the Account we have here given you of the intire Defeat of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces.</p>
