            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

joyfull commemoration of the happy return of <hi>God's Anointed,</hi> and their long exiled <hi>King:</hi> He is the <hi>stone.</hi> A <hi>stone</hi> hewen out of the rock, by <hi>God's</hi> own hand; consecrated with the Holy Oyle by <hi>God's</hi> own Prophet; set apart by <hi>God's</hi> appointment, to smite down the great <hi>Goliah</hi> of the Philistines, to dash in pieces the Tyranny of a wicked <hi>Saul,</hi> to crush to nothing the Enemies of <hi>God</hi> and of his chosen <hi>Israel.</hi> A <hi>stone</hi> fitted and squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be the foundation, and pillar of his <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> his <hi>Sion;</hi> solid and <hi>firme,</hi> such as the hottest fires of Persecution could not crack; nor all the stormes and tempests of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction impaire; of that weight, and so well fixable, that all the strength and art of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and his Instruments could not remove or shake it; but still he stood fast, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, the Pillar, the sure stay and support of <hi>God's</hi> Church and People committed to his Charge.

A good <hi>King</hi> is indeed a most precious <hi>stone,</hi> the most solid foundation of the Church's peace and the Peopl's happynes: remove this <hi>stone,</hi> and the whole house comes down upon your head; touch but the <hi>Lord's anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> and you disjoint all, the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome shatters into confusion; all falls into pieces, and all the wit of man is not able to bind it up again: Proofs and instances of this sad truth we have too many, our own lamentable experience, still fresh in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, renders all citations of them at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent needlesse: Hereby we have found, that whosoever wildly pushes at these sacred <hi>stones,</hi> he onely runs his head against an hard Rock, which though he should have the unhappy strength to shake a little, yet he shall be sure withall to dash out his own brains, at lest he must expect to receive such a wound, as cannot easily be healed but he is like to bleed into a too late repentance: He that fights against the <hi>powers</hi> set up by God, can onely beat the skin off his own fingers. It will be therefore our <hi>Prudence</hi> as

well as our <hi>duty,</hi> not to strike with too much violence upon these holy <hi>stones,</hi> left like men hammering too boldly on a good flint, wee thence produce such a fire as will not again be quenched: <hi>Saint Paul</hi> dares not warrant so strange a Confidence, when he tels us, <hi>(Rom. 13.) They that resist the power shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to themselves Damnation.</hi> Rather pray we, that we may never come to want such a <hi>Stone</hi> as God here profer'd in the Text. but,</p>
            <p n="2">2. To <hi>whom</hi> did he proffer it?</p>
            <p>Even to <hi>those,</hi> who wanted not eyes to see it, nor experience to understand the worth and value of it, nor skill sufficient to make a right use of it. <hi>David</hi> was profer'd, not to the poor <hi>rude Israelites,</hi> that could not distinguish their right hand from their left, but to the <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> to <hi>Saul</hi> and his <hi>Councellours;</hi> whose businesse and Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion it was to deal in such <hi>Stones.</hi> Our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>IESVS</hi> was profer'd, not onely to a few blind Gentiles, who had all their knowledg but at the second hand; the wonder had
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41587:11"/>
not been great if these had refused what they so little understood; but he was proffer'd to the <hi>VVise men</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> to the great <hi>Maister-builders</hi> of that Church, <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees, Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Doctors;</hi> those that knew the <hi>Law,</hi> and had read the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and understood what was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, and prefigured concerning him: whose bare <hi>acceptance</hi> of him, had been precedent and warrant enough for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>Faith;</hi> as appears by that question <hi>(Iohn 7, 48.) have any of the Rulers or of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees believed on him?</hi> So would they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly have said, Have any of the <hi>Rulers</hi> or <hi>Pharisees received</hi> this <hi>stone?</hi> If they have, then so will <hi>we.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is God's method, he so proffers his great <hi>Blessings</hi> as to leave the refuser without excuse; to those who best could discerne the worth of it, and therefore should first in all reason have begun to use it, was this Gift proffer'd: lest afterwards they should goe about to excuse themselves with a <hi>Non novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, we knew is not:</hi> The fittest <hi>Blessing</hi> to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41587:12"/>
the fittest <hi>persons,</hi> the <hi>stone</hi> to the <hi>builders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Lett's now see, what's it's <hi>welcome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed very <hi>course</hi> and more <hi>strange,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the persons to whom it was prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd: so <hi>foolish</hi> were they, or so <hi>selfish,</hi> or <hi>both;</hi> they <hi>refused</hi> it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>David</hi> is thrust out from the presence of <hi>Saul,</hi> bannish'd the Land, driven into Caves and Dens, to lead a sad &amp; melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life with Bears and Tygres; or at best, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst strangers, too frequently more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane and barbarous, then those beasts of prey. He is hunted like a silly partridge upon the Mountains, and no means that a cruell and jealous <hi>Saul</hi> could invent, left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attempted, to rid him of his Kingdome and the world at once.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And in this particular too, was our Blessed JESVS, very truly the <hi>Son of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> He is <hi>refused</hi> of his own People and Nation: rejected by the chief <hi>Rulers,</hi> and <hi>High-priests,</hi> with a—No King but <hi>Caesar:—</hi>Not this man, but <hi>Barabbas.</hi> Any murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, rather then the Lord of life; a bloody
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41587:12"/>
Tyrant, rather then the God of mercies; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to the <hi>Crosse</hi> with him. This is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry voyce of the builders, No stone of God's squaring for our building, out with it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rubbish: Give us rather a <hi>Nero,</hi> any lump of clay kneeded up in Christian blood: Give us such stones as will admit of no Cement, but what's made of the <hi>blood of us and of our Children:</hi> that blood which <hi>Caesar</hi> sheds, be it on the heads of us and ours, but this stone which God would in mercy bestow upon us, be it thrown out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the streets, and trampled under our feet forever. This is the language of these prudent <hi>builders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, even thus doe the <hi>builders</hi> too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten prove the unhappy <hi>demolishers,</hi> and when they should strengthen, rase to the ground the walls of <hi>Hierusalem:</hi> whilest they lay their own <hi>ambition,</hi> their <hi>Humors,</hi> and their <hi>Interests,</hi> the onely Foundations of all their actions; they are sure to <hi>refuse</hi> that <hi>stone,</hi> which is sent down from Heaven. Here's the Wisedome of the Wise, this is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41587:13"/>
of the Prudent, when they have not God before their Eyes. The <hi>stone is refused,</hi> which yet in spite of all their little Policies, and petty devices, shall most certainly return the <hi>Head-stone of the building.</hi> Which brings us from the Folly and Basenesse of the <hi>buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> to the unerring Wisedome, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Goodnesse, of <hi>God Almighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They</hi> cast out the <hi>stone, God</hi> brings it in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>They</hi> reject it with <hi>scorn, He</hi> sets it in with <hi>advantage, They refuse</hi> it as uselesse, and unfit for any thing, <hi>He restores</hi> it the Beuty, the strength of the whole Fabrick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David,</hi> after his long and tedious exile, is call'd home again, even by those same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who at first were as ready as any to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him; with the shouts and acclamations of <hi>Israal</hi> he is welcomed, and made the Glory of that people, and their bulwark, by whom he had been so much sleighted.</p>
            <p>And thus was it with the great <hi>Rock of our Salvation,</hi> after his numerous and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous sufferings, hardly ending in a bitter and a shamefull death; He rose again, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41587:13"/>
into Heaven in Glory and Triumph, and is become the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Universall Church,</hi> and the onely Sanctuary those very Enemies who refused him can confide in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God</hi> will have his designe, let man do his worst; he will make all those in his due time to understand their own folly, who would not when they ought, embrace his Counsaile. The <hi>stones</hi> which He sends are more precious in his eyes then to lye always unreguarded on a Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill: <hi>David's</hi> Palace and Kingdome shall not forever be a Cave and a wildernesse; <hi>Christ</hi>'s Crown shall not alwaies be made of Thornes; Those Cruell hammerings, and rougher usages, which the despised <hi>stone</hi> at present undergoes, shall not break and Crush it, but, on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Square and smooth, and polish it, and make it the more serviceable, and fitter for the building; His Enemies at length shall know, that those many torments they barbarously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on him, shall reflect with doubled force upon themselves; and by a seasonable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected restauration they shall be made to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the undeserved exile of their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41587:14"/>
               <hi>David,</hi> was not the punishment of his Sins, but the greatest curse could be lay'd upon his very Persecutors.</p>
            <p>And here, on the one hand, we may clearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the folly and blindnesse of worldly men, even of those who would fain be esteem'd the wisest and skilfull'st <hi>builders</hi> &amp; repairers of a broaken state; on the other hand, the Infinite Wisedome and Providence of <hi>God,</hi> even in those actions which seem lest considerable to the dim eyes of men. Here we see man's Unworthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and perversnesse in slighting and <hi>refusing</hi> the very choisest of God's blessings, <hi>there</hi> God's Infinite mercy and unalterable Goodnesse in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling</hi> his blessings after they have been <hi>refused:</hi> In short, <hi>here's</hi> man's impiety in rejecting the <hi>stone</hi> which <hi>God</hi> had design'd, and by <hi>proffering</hi> it, Commended: <hi>there's God's</hi> Justice in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that despised <hi>stone</hi> to become at last, all that he intended it for at first, even the <hi>Head-stone of the Corner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Thus are we, from the <hi>wonderfull mercy,</hi> come to the <hi>cheerfull reception</hi> thereof. It is received (as so great a blessing ought to be) with an <hi>humble
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41587:14"/>
acknowledgement</hi> of the Author, with an <hi>high ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration</hi> of the Mercy.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41587:15"/>
cannot goe by us without a due observation, a seasonable wonder, and an humble reflection upon the glorious and Omnipotent agent: If <hi>David</hi> had yet had any visible meanes left him, of ridding himselfe out of Danger, and attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto that Crown, which was fitted by <hi>God</hi> for his head, they would have been lesse apt through the multitude of humane means, to eye the hand of <hi>God</hi> in his advancement: But that he should be restored even <hi>now</hi> and <hi>thus,</hi> whose <hi>doing</hi> should <hi>this be</hi> but the LORD'<hi>s?</hi> for</p>
            <p n="1">1. Behold the poor exiled Prince, wandering to and fro, in a rude wildernesse, as destitute of all hopes to man's thinking, as of companions: his strength failing him, his lovers and his friends standing aloof from his Soul, many enemies on all sides, and perhaps some few well wishers, but, alas, no helpers:</p>
            <p n="2">2. Behold the sweetnesse of his generous &amp; Princely Soul, abhorring to be cruell more then desiring to be King: more delighting in Mercy, and contented in his sufferings, and confiding in his GOD, and reverencing a King, though a Saul, a Tyrant, then to revenge himself, when
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41587:15"/>
GOD had put the life of his Enemies into his hand.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Behold his Enemies, for multitude innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, for malice implacable, for Interest insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable; no force could subdue, no Reasons per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade, no condescensions mollifie, no hopes of a reconciliation or agreement upon terms or arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; so that in the <hi>first</hi> place to the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Author</hi> we must confes—<hi>It was the LORD's doing.</hi>

            <p>And <hi>again,</hi> for the Justifying of <hi>David's</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous cause, and for the abatement of his <hi>adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries</hi> confidence and boasting, he shewes, it was the LORD's doing. Prosperity and Success accompany'd with Oppression and Violence, make but a slender argument, for the Honesty and Innocence of a thriving Tyranny: but a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den promotion out of the dust, by an unexpected hand from Heaven, conducting a poore rejected <hi>David,</hi> through the fury of his Enemies, into the embraces of his friends, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Cave to a Throne, may beget a very strong perswasion of a <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cause:</hi> when the mouth of the fierce Lyons are closed by a <hi>naked Daniel;</hi> when the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame raging of a fiery Furnace is still'd and

cool'd at the approach of three <hi>fetter'd Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents;</hi> when the Bolts fall off, and the doors fly open without a Key or a File, to set the <hi>sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled Apostles</hi> at Liberty; who will not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, that <hi>GOD</hi>'s favour is Sanctuary enough for an Injured Innocence; his purpose to save, armour enough against man's endeavours to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy; that there is no Policy against Providence, no stratagem against Heaven? Had <hi>David</hi> by force of armes, with a great Hoste of men enter'd the Land, and so made havock of his Enemies, the residue of them might still have cbeer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selv's up with such hopes as these, that seeing there were yet more men in the world, they might yet come to regain all, as they got it a first, or lost it now, by an <hi>arme of flesh.</hi> But now when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the <hi>LORD</hi> making <hi>bare</hi> his <hi>own arme</hi> from Heaven, &amp; shewing himself mindfull of <hi>David</hi> in his lowest condition, bringing all the subtile devices of the long prosperous sinner to none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, &amp; without the help of man, even against all the projects of man, restoring his <hi>Anointed</hi> to his own: how can they chuse, but seeing, be amazed &amp; wonder, be silenced, and condemning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41587:16"/>
and their own Folly, with all humility, at least, with shame and confusion of face ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, that <hi>it is the</hi> LORD'<hi>s doing?</hi> and therefore</p>
            <p n="2">2. Truly Marveilous in our eyes.</p>
            <p>Indeed all the works of <hi>GOD,</hi> when consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as they ought to be, are <hi>wonders,</hi> but such works as this was, the more immediate <hi>doings</hi> of the LORD, are to be acknowledged above measure <hi>wonderfull:</hi> Considering</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>rarity</hi> of them, such blessings come not every day, the LORD <hi>makes a Day</hi> for them, and by them. He is not altogether pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall of his Miracles, but reserveth them for speciall occasions, and for great Ends: that he may thereby manifest his power in the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his servant <hi>David;</hi> and his adversary's weaknesse and folly, in the very height of their policy and Confidence; and the equity of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s cause in the midst of his Enemies triumph: Ordinarily <hi>GOD</hi> works by common and known methods, but when such a singular act of Providence, as unusuall and new, as true and effectuall, discovers it selfe to our view, must it not be <hi>marveilous in our eyes?</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:41587:17"/>
2. Again, when such deliverances are wrought by methods so farre above all, both expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Inventions of friends; and not onely so, but above all fears too and preventions of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: when so many means formerly, in the eyes of man more likely, had proved utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectuall; so many endeavours and projects, in the opinion of most men strong and sure, had been altogether quash'd and frustrated; and yet notwithstanding all this, the blessing, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven almost despair'd of, comes at last, and that with interest; <hi>it</hi> must needs be truly <hi>marvellous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Once more, When GOD so works, that man doth not see it, yea even secretly in the hearts of those who do not yet understand it; directing their actions to those very ends which, it may be, they least intended; strangely, and secretly charming the Disobedient into Duty, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious into Loyalty: when the promoters of <hi>David's</hi> exile, are made the main Instruments of his restauration; and all those fretting <hi>Shimeies</hi> which would still fain curse, can or dare do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but blesse and congratulate: certainly, <hi>This must needs be the</hi> LORD's <hi>doing, and altogether marvailous in our eyes.</hi>

            <p>

            <p>How much of <hi>England's</hi> happinesse is bound up in the Prudence and Fortune of <hi>England's Kings:</hi> How long this famous Nation may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly continue <hi>one Body,</hi> without <hi>one Head,</hi> How long those two great sides of this glorious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> may stand firme and unshaken, as they ought to be, the beauty, the strength and support of each other, if not well knit together by these <hi>Corner-stones:</hi> Our ancient flourishing, and out late miserable and never sufficiently deplored condition, when compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, will too manifestly evidence.

alas! we have to our sorrow found, what sad <hi>Daies</hi> those were, wherein <hi>there was no King in our Israel, dayes</hi> full of nothing but black clouds, raging winds, and fat all stormes, in which both <hi>God's</hi> house and <hi>Cesar's</hi> were blowne downe to the ground; all honest and Loyall men driven out of the Land, or dispersed, and scatter'd, and hurled into the little narrow Corners of the earth, making privacy and poverty their sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary: nothing appear'd for many yeares together but the horrid face of Rebellion and confusion; no Religion, no Law, no Justice, no Charity, no Order, nay, nothing but the bare name of that, a meer pretence wherof was craftily impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon a deluded multitude as a sufficient warrant for their disobedience, &amp; a sure basis for <hi>Anarchy,</hi> or what's neerest of Kin to it, a <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,</hi> indeed nothing but the bare name of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.

Why should it be any longer said to our shame, that <hi>swearing,</hi> &amp; <hi>drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>deriding Religion,</hi> and <hi>making a mock of Holinesse,</hi> are the Principall badges of such as call themselves <hi>Royallists?</hi> We know <hi>who</hi> and <hi>what</hi> they are who have long agoe publikely boasted, that they have been the <hi>King's</hi> best Subjects and Friends, the way to confute them is not to <hi>swear</hi> they are not so, but to prove by our <hi>actions</hi> that

we indeed are so: and to do this, there's no way left us but to be as <hi>sincerely</hi> Religious, as they <hi>hypocrytically:</hi> We may safely give leave to the <hi>Covenanter,</hi> the <hi>Engager,</hi> and the rest of a <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> people to pretend as high as they can, whil'st we are sure we are as much as they can pretend to Let us but once <hi>out-doe</hi> and <hi>out live</hi> them, 'tis no great matter who <hi>out-talks,</hi> and <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braves</hi> us: but let us by no meanes <hi>give occasion to the enemies of God to Blaspheme;</hi> but whilst we endeavour to expresse our <hi>Loyalty</hi> in our <hi>Ioy,</hi> let our <hi>joy</hi> be most clearly manifested in our <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to <hi>His</hi> just commands, and in our <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> to his <hi>good</hi> example; whose <hi>first Proclamation</hi> was to <hi>condemne</hi> and <hi>prohibit,</hi> and whose whole course of <hi>life</hi> is to <hi>shame</hi> all manner of <hi>Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> and <hi>debauchery.</hi> Let but our good and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous actions first stop the <hi>mouthes</hi> of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and then our Righteous <hi>God</hi> will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly bind their <hi>hands,</hi> and turne their <hi>hearts,</hi> and make us all at last charitably and unanimous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to joyne in the Praises of that great <hi>God,</hi> who hath miraculously restored our <hi>Corner-stone,</hi> and rebuilt our <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and made her once more
