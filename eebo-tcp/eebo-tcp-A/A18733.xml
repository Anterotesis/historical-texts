            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Worshipfull, my most

one of the Queenes Maiesties Priuie Chamber, &amp; Post-maister
of England. Thomas Church-yard wisheth much hap,
great health, with great prosperity, and

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> AM BOLD RIGHT VVOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull,
on the generall report of good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and great commendation that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest
sort giues you (besides mine own affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
to present a fewe sorrowfull verses vnto
your protection and iudgement. And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
moued to write of some sad inuention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I neuer knewe you delight in light or wanton discourses.
Many times I haue beheld the eeuen carriage of your behauiour
and good inclination, towards vertuous exercises &amp; studies, that
many wayes produced as much benefite to those you fauour, as
procured profit and commoditie to your selfe: a naturall dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of a good minde, necessary to bee about Princes, and a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednes
that in these dayes is not common among men. And for
feare I should runne too far in those causes by manifest speeches
(which is not commonly allowed) I desire no more in you, but a
continuance of goodnes and those vertues rehearsed, and so fall I
to my purposed matter. The troth is good Sir, in the long pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of mine, I purchased many good friendes (requisite for my
infortunat life) which friends did no soner encrease, but in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as quickly went away, either by death or some vnwelcome
accident: and loozing dayly one or an other that stood mee in
great steede, I bethought me ouer-often on my great losse, so sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
a kinde of lamentation in that behalfe to expresse the want
of such friendes, I presumed to offer you this simple Pamphlet,
as a testimony to be thankfull to those that did me pleasure, (the
Bishop of Oxford one of the chiefest,) and to keepe their fauour
I honour and loue, who now are aliue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5238:3"/>This trifle in verse, is named, <hi>A Feast of sad cheere,</hi> because
the best banquets I can make to my friendes, is but bare Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
Epitaphes, or such bitter fruite as sewe doe feede on, and
many takes no taste in, the sowrnes of my delicates so little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
a multitude. And indeed Syr now I am left voyd of al pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision,
and am compelled to present such things as comes next
to my hande, because a Booke called my Challenge, (dedicated to
the honorable, Maister Secretarie <hi>Wolley;</hi>) hath caried away most,
or all together of my other conceits: yet my hope is, this little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
that I offer you, shall be as well accepted, as though I
could haue feasted you with a finer Banquet; for you knowing
mine abilitie in furniture and knowledge, I trust you will take
well in worth what of good will I am able to bring.</p>
            <p>Thus wishing you much harts ease, worldly hap, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie
felicitie, I take my leaue, desiring you with fauour to reade
that which followeth.</p>

            <l>Let sports and pleasures silent be, and name no earthly blis:</l>

            <l>So if you shape your selues to heare, what did by death befall:</l>
            <l>This verse may chaunce to change your cheare, &amp; make you mourne withall.</l>
            <l>A knight here lies but late aliue, who purchast pereles praise:</l>
            <l>Who nobly long for fame did striue, by seruise sundry waise.</l>
            <l>On sea and land a happy man, that bore a Lyons hart:</l>
            <l>Who honor wealth &amp; worship wan, throw sword and due desart.</l>
            <l>His skill and councell gaue great grace, where martial people were:</l>
            <l>And where he shewd his manly face, he put his foes in feare.</l>
            <l>A victor that brought conquest home, from many a fight and field:</l>
            <l>A Champion that in hard attempts, had rather die then yield.</l>
            <l>A chieftain oft that might commaund, both ships &amp; men good store:</l>
            <l>A gallant guide that throw would goe, and leade them all before.</l>
            <l>His presence promisd good successe of all he tooke in hand:</l>
            <l>A cheerefull comfort in distresse, a lode-star of our Lande.</l>
            <l>A worthy that had great regard<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> of charge and liues of men:</l>
            <l>A wight in world right well preferd, by sword but not by pen.</l>

            <l>A sparke of <hi>Mars</hi> by speech &amp; lookes, wherein the world might spy:</l>
            <l>A warlike mind a worthy head, a hart and courage hye.</l>

            <l>And so set all the world at nought, and died as meeke as Doue.</l>
            <l>We hope the heauens haue embrast, the soule we could not keepe:</l>

            <l>From bitter biasts and tempests still, how ere the winde did blow.</l>

            <l>In chaste content and single wise, a good report to gaine,</l>
