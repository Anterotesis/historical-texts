            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether is it lawfull for me to raiſe any profit by the loane of money?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou may not expect a poſitive anſwer either way: Many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ere any thing can be determined.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Who is it that borrows? A poore neighbour that is conſtrained out of need? or a Merchant that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53799:13"/>
takes up money for a freer trade? or a rich man that layes it out upon ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous occaſions?</p>
               <p>If a poore man borrow out of neceſſity, you may not expect any profit for the loane: <hi>(Deuteronomy</hi> 15. 7, 8, 9.) To the pooreſt of all we muſt give, and not lend: to the next ranke of poore we muſt lend freely: but if a man will borrow that money (which you could improve) for the enriching of himſelfe; or out of a wanton expence will be laying out that which might be otherwiſe uſefull to you, for his meere pleaſure, the caſe is different; For God hath not commanded you to love any man more then your ſelfe; and there can be no reaſon why you ſhould vail your owne juſt advantage to another mans exceſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, upon what termes doe you lend? whether upon an abſolute compact for a ſet increment, (what
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53799:13"/>
ever become of the principall) or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a friendly truſt to a voluntary ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction according to the good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the ſumme lent? The former is not ſafe, and where there hath beene an honeſt indevour of a juſt benefit diſappointed either by unavoidable caſualty, or force, may not be rigorouſly urged, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt oppreſſion. The latter can be no other then lawfull: and with thoſe that are truly faithfull and conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, the bond of gratitude is no leſſe ſtrong then that of law and juſtice.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if upon an abſolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact; is it upon a certainty, or an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture? for where you are willing to hazard the principall, there can be no reaſon but you ſhould expect to take part of the advantage.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, where the trade is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily certaine, there are yet farther conſiderations to be had: to which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53799:14"/>
ſhall make way by theſe undenyable grounds.</p>
               <p>That the value of moneys or other commodities is arbitrable according to the ſoveraigne authority and uſe of ſeverall Kingdomes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <p>That whatſoever commodity is ſaleable, is capable of a profit in the loane of it; as an horſe, or an oxe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it may be ſold, may be let out for profit.</p>
               <p>Money it ſelfe is not onely the price of all commodities in all civill Nations, but it is alſo, in ſome caſes, a trafiqueable commodity: the price whereof riſes, and fals in ſeverall countries upon occaſion; and yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth either profit or loſſe in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</p>
               <p>There can be no doubt therefore but that money thus conſidered, and as it were turned merchandiſe, may be bought and ſold, and improved to a juſt profit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:53799:14"/>
But the maine doubt is, whether money meerely couſidered as the price of all other commodities, may be let forth for profit; and be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a warrantable increaſe. For the reſolving whereof be it determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</p>
               <p>That all uſury, which is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute contract for the mere loane of money, is unlawfull both by law na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and poſitive, both divine and humane.</p>
               <p>Nature teacheth us that metals are not a thing capable of a ſuperfoeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that no man ought to ſet a price on that which is not his owne time: that the uſe of the ſtock once recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is not the lenders, but the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers; for the power, and right of diſpoſing the principall, is by contract transferred for the time to the hands of him that receives it; ſo as hee that takes the intereſt by vertue of ſuch tranſaction, doth but in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53799:15"/>
and legall faſhion rob the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower.</p>
               <p>How frequent the <note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. 22. 25. Levit. 25. 36, 37. Deut. 23. 19, 20. Nehem. 5. 7. Pſal. 15. 5. Prov. 28. 8. Ezek. 18. 8.</note> Scripture is in the prohibition of this practice, no Chriſtian can be ignorant: And as for humane lawes raiſed even from the mere light of Nature amongſt Heathen Nations, how odious, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely interdicted uſurary contracts, have been in all times, it appeares ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently by the Records which we have of the Decrees of <note n="a">Vid. Alexand. ab Alexand. Gen. dierum l. 1. c. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Egypt,</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and not onely by the reſtraint of the Twelve Tables, and of <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Veſpaſian;</hi> but by the abſolute forbiddance of many popular ſtatutes condemning this uſage: <hi>Tiberius</hi> himſelfe, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe wicked enough, yet would rather furniſh the Bankes with his owne ſtock, to be freely let out for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53799:15"/>
three yeeres to the Citizens, upon onely ſecurity of the ſumme doubled in the forfaiture, then he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure this griping &amp; oppreſſive tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action: And how wiſe <hi>Cato</hi> drove out all uſurers out of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> and <hi>Lucullus</hi> freed all <hi>Aſia</hi> from this preſſure of Intereſt, Hiſtory hath ſufficiently recorded.</p>
               <p>As for Lawes Eccleſiaſticall, let it be enough that a <note n="*" place="bottom">Concil. Viennenſ.</note> Councel hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, that to ſay uſury is not a ſinne, is no better then hereſie: and in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding times how liable the uſurer hath ever been to the higheſt cenſures of the Church; and how excluded from the favour of Chriſtian buriall, is more manifeſt then to need any proofe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, however it is unlawfull to convenant for a certaine profit for the mere loane of money, yet there may be, and are circumſtances ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53799:16"/>
to the loane, which may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of ſome benefit to be lawfully made by the lender for the uſe of his money; and eſpecially theſe two; the loſſe that he ſuſtaines, and the gaine that he miſſes, by the want of the ſumme lent: For what reaſon can there be, that to pleaſure another man, I ſhould hurt my ſelfe, that I ſhould enrich another by my owne loſſe?</p>
               <p>If then I ſhall incur a reall loſſe or forfaiture by the delayed payment of the ſumme lent, I may juſtly look for a ſatisfaction from the borrower; yea if there be a true danger of loſſe to me imminent, when the tranſaction is made, nothing hinders but that I may by compact make ſure ſuch a ſumme as may be ſufficient for my indemnity; And if I ſee an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of an apparent profit that I could make fairly by the disburſing of ſuch a ſumme <hi>bonafide,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53799:16"/>
that hath a more gainfull bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in chace ſhall ſue to me to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row my money out of my hand for his own greater advantage, there can be no reaſon why in ſuch a caſe I ſhould have more reſpect to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, then my owne; and why ſhould I not even upon pact, ſecure unto my ſelfe ſuch a moderate ſumme as may be ſomewhat anſwerable to the gaine which I doe willingly forgoe, for his greater profit? Since it is a true ground which <hi>Leſsius</hi> (with other Caſuiſts) maintains againſt <hi>Sotus</hi> and <hi>Durand,</hi> that even our hopes of an evident commodity are valuable; and that no leſſe then the feares of our loſſe.</p>
               <p>Shortly, for the guidance of our either caution, or liberty in matter of borrowing, and lending, the onely Cynoſure is our <hi>Charity;</hi> for in all humane and civill acts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, it is a ſure rule, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53799:17"/>
is not a violation of Charity cannot be unlawfull, and whatſoever is not agreeable to Charity can be no other then ſinfull: And as Charity muſt be your rule, ſo your ſelfe muſt be the rule of your Charity; Look what you could wiſh to be done to you by others, doe but the ſame to others, you cannot be guilty of the breach of Charity: The maximes of Trafique are almoſt infinite; onely Charity (but ever inſeparable from Juſtice) muſt make the application of them; That will teach you that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry increaſe by loane of money is not uſurarie; and that thoſe which are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ſuch, are damnable: that will teach you to diſtinguiſh betwixt the one improvement of loane, and the other; and will tell you that if you can find out a way, whether by loane, or ſale, to advance your ſtock, that may be free from all oppreſſion, and extortion; and beneficiall as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53799:17"/>
well to others, as to your ſelfe, you need not feare to walke in it with all honeſt ſecurity: but in the meane time take good heed that your heart beguile you not in miſ-applications; for we are naturally too apt out of our ſelf-love to flatter our ſelves with faire glozes of bad intentions; and rather to draw the rule to us, then our ſelves to the rule.</p>
               <p>But whiles I give you this ſhort ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, I muſt profeſſe to lament the common ignorance, or miſtaking of too many Chriſtians, whoſe zeal juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cryes downe uſury as a moſt hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and abominable practice, but in the meane time makes no bones of actions no leſſe biting, and oppreſſive: they care not how high they ſell any of their commodities, at how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable rates they ſet their grounds, how they circumvent the buyer in their bargaines, and think any price juſt, any gain lawfull that they can
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53799:18"/>
make in their markets: not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there is neither leſſe, nor leſſe odious uſury in ſelling and letting, then there is in lending: It is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion in both that makes the ſinne; without which the kind or termes of the tranſaction could not be guilty. Surely it muſt needs be a great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to think that the ſame God who requires mercy and favour in lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will allow us to be cruell in ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; Rigour and exceſſe in both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually violates the law of commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juſtice, equally croſſes the law of Charity: Let thoſe therefore that make ſcruple of an uſurious lending, learn to make no leſſe conſcience of a racking bargain; otherwiſe their partiall obedience will argue a groſſe hypocriſie; and they ſhal prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the worſt kind of what they hate, uſurers: For in the ordinary loan-uſury, the borrower hath yet time to boot for his money; but here
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53799:18"/>
the buyer payes downe an exceſſive intereſt, without any conſideration at all, but the ſellers crueltie. For the fuller clearing of which point; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you aske</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether may I not ſell my wares as deare as I can, and get what I may of every buyer?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I anſwer,</p>
               <p>THere is a due price to be ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every ſaleable commodity; elſe there were no commerce to be uſed among men: For if every man might ſet what rate he pleaſes upon his lands or goods, where ſhould he find a buyer? ſurely nothing could follow but confuſion, and want; for mere extremity muſt both make the market and regulate it.</p>
               <p>The due price is that which cuts
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53799:19"/>
equally and indifferently betwixt the buyer and ſeller; ſo as the ſeller may receive a moderate gaine, and the buyer a juſt penny-worth.</p>
               <p>In thoſe countries wherein there is a price ſet by publique authority up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all marketable commodities, the way of commerce is well expedited, and it is ſoone and eaſily determined, that it is meet men ſhould be held cloſe to the rule.</p>
               <p>But where all things are left to an arbitrary tranſaction, there were no living if ſome limits were not ſet to the ſellers demands.</p>
               <p>Theſe limits muſt be the ordinary received proportion of price current in the ſeverall countries wherein they are ſold; and the judgement of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, wiſe, experienced and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned perſons; and the well ſtated conſcience of the ſeller.</p>
               <p>If men ſhall wilfully run beyond theſe bounds, taking advantage of

               <p>That the common maxime current <note n="*" place="bottom">Dom. Sot. de Juſtit. &amp; Jure l. 6. quaeſt. 2.

               <p>It were an happy thing, if as it is in ſome other well ordered nations, there were a certaine regulation of the prices of all commodities by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique authority, the wiſedome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of knowes how to riſe and fall accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

to the neceſſity of the occaſion; ſo as the buyer might be ſecured from injury, and the ſeller reſtrained from a lawleſſe oppreſſion.

               <p>A good conſcience therefore will tell you that if (taking advantage of the ignorance or unskilfulneſſe of the buyer) you have made a prey of him by drawing from him double the worth of the commodity ſold, you are bound to make reſtitution to him accordingly; and in a proportion ſo, in all the conſiderable ſummes which you ſhall have by your falſe proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

ſo decides it as that his judgement may juſtly ſhame and condemne the practice of too many Chriſtians: For a full anſwer, due conſideration muſt be had of divers circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Firſt, what the nature and quality of the fault is; whether it be fleight and unimporting; or whether ſuch as may vitiate the thing ſold, and render it either unuſefull or dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the buyer: or againe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fault be apparent, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret: both theſe doe juſtly vary the caſe: ſleight and harmles faults may be concealed without injuſtice; maine and importing muſt be ſignified: if apparent defects be not diſcerned by the buyer, he may thanke himſelfe; ſecret faults knowne onely to the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, (ſuch as may be prejudiciall to the buyer) ought not to be concealed: or if they be concealed ſo, as that the buyer payes for it as ſound, and perfect, binde the ſeller in conſcience,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53799:22"/>
either to void the bargaine, or to give juſt ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it would be conſidered, whether the buyer before the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine be ſtricken, hath required of the ſeller to ſignifie the faults of the commodity to be ſold, and out of a reliance upon the ſellers fidelity and warrant, hath made up the match: or whether in the confidence of his owne skill, without moving any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, he enter reſolutely, <hi>(de bene eſſc)</hi> upon the bargained commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: If the former, a double bond lyes upon the ſeller to deale faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the buyer, and therefore to let him know the true condition of the thing expoſed to ſale, that ſo either he may take off his hand; or if he ſhall ſee that notwithſtanding that defect it may ſerve his turne, he may proportion the price accordingly: otherwiſe he ſhall be guilty (beſides falſhood and oppreſſion) of perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53799:23"/>
But if the buyer will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily rely upon his owne judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and as preſuming to make a gaine of that bargaine (which the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler out of concience of the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſets (as he ought) ſo much lower as the defect may be more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous to the buyer) will goe through with the contract, and ſtand to all hazards, I ſee no reaſon why the ſeller may not receive the price ſtipulated; but withall if the match may carry danger in it to the buyer, (as if the horſe ſold be ſubject to a perilous ſtarting, or ſtumbling; the houſe ſold have a ſecret crack that may threaten ruine; or the land ſold be liable to a litigious claime which may be timely avoyded) the ſeller is bound in conſcience (at leaſt after the bargaine) to intimate unto the buyer theſe faulty qualities, that he may accordingly provide for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the miſchiefe that may enſue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:53799:23"/>

In this, ſhortly, and in all other caſes that concerne trade, theſe univerſall rules muſt take place. That it is not lawfull for a Chriſtian chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to thrive by fraud.

               <p>THere is no great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt this caſe, and that of loane, which is formerly anſwered; ſave that there money is let, here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities money-worth; here is a ſale, there a lending; in the one a transferring of the right and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for the time; in the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually: but the ſubſtance both of the matter and queſtion is the ſame; for in both there ſeems to be a valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of time: which whether in caſe of mutuation, or ſale, may juſtly be ſuſpected for unlawfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:53799:24"/>
For anſwer;</p>
               <p>There are three ſtages of prices acknowledged by all Caſuiſts; the higheſt, which they are wont to call Rigorous; the meane, and the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; If theſe keep within due bounds, though the higheſt be hard, yet it is not unjuſt, and if the loweſt be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable, yet it is not alwayes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
               <p>If then you ſhall proportion but a juſt price to the time, and worth of your bargaine, ſo as the preſent ſhall paſſe for the eaſieſt price, ſome ſhort time for the meane, and the longer delay for the higheſt, I ſee not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, all things conſidered, you doe offend.</p>
               <p>And certainly to debarre the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of a moderate gaine for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of payment upon moneths pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, were to deſtroy all trade of merchandiſe: For not many buyers are furniſhed with ready money to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53799:25"/>
buy their wares, at the Port; nor could the ſellers make off their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities ſo ſeaſonably, as to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for further trafique, if they muſt neceſſarily be tyed to wait upon the hopes of a pecuniary ſale; and not left to the common liberty of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them over to whole-ſale men upon truſt; who upon a ſecond truſt diſtribute them to thoſe, that vent them by retaile, both for days agreed upon: By which meanes the trade holds up, and the common-wealth enjoyes the benefit of a convenient and neceſſary commerce.</p>
               <p>A practice that is now ſo habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated amongſt all nations into the courſe of trade, that it cannot well conſiſt without it: So as nothing is more ordinary in experience then that thoſe who are able to pay downe ready money for their wares, know to expect a better pennyworth, then thoſe that runne upon truſt: And
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53799:25"/>
there may be juſt reaſon for this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; For the preſent money re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived enables the ſeller to a further improvement of his ſtock, which lyes for the time dead in the hands that take day for their payment.</p>
               <p>So then, it is not mere time that is here ſet to ſale, which were odious in any Chriſtian to bargain for; but there are two incidents into this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice which may render it not unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable. The one is the hazard of the ſumme agreed upon: which too often comes ſhort in the payment: whiles thoſe ſubordinate chapmen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe hands the groſſe ſumme is ſcattered, turne bankrupts, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait their truſt; ſo as no ſmall loſſe is this way commonly ſuſtained by the confident ſeller; in which regard we are wont to ſay juſtly, that One bird in the hand is worth two in the wood. The other is the ceſſation of that gaine which the merchant might
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53799:26"/>
in the meane time have made of the ſum differred; which might in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood have beene greater then the proportion of the raiſed price can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount unto; to which may be added the foreſeene probability of the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the market in the intervall of payment: the profit whereof is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by this meanes to the ſeller; whoſe full ingagement takes him off perhaps from a reſolution to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved thoſe commodities in his own hands in expectation of an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a more profitable utterance, had not the forwardneſſe of the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er importuned a prevention.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe conſiderations, if they be ſerious, and unfained; I ſee not why you may not in a due and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate proportion, difference your prices according to the delayes of payment, without any oppreſſion to the buyer: Howbeit, if any man pleaſeth to be ſo free, as to take no
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53799:26"/>
notice of time, but to make future dayes in his account, preſent, I ſhall commend his charity, though I dare not preſſe his example as neceſſary.</p>
               <p>The caſe is equally juſt on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the ſeller: who if he be either driven by ſome emergent neceſſity; or drawne by the opportunity of a more gainfull bargaine, to call for his money before his day, may juſtly be required by the late buyer, to abate of the returnable ſumme, in regard of the prevention of the time cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted; by reaſon of the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or loſſe whereunto he is put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſuddaine revocation of that money, which is not by agreement payable till the expiration of the time prefixed. But what quantity is to be allowed on the one part, or defalked on the other, is onely to be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by Chriſtian Charity, and that univerſall rule of doing what we would be willing to ſuffer.</p>

                  <p>Whether, and how farre, Monopolies are, or may be lawfull.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe moſt famous Monopolie that we finde in hiſtory is that of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> Gen. 41. 56, 57. wherein the provident Patriarch <hi>Joſeph,</hi> out of the fore-ſight of a following dearth, bought up the ſeven yeares graine for <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and layd it up in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ſtore-houſes; and in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſcarcity ſold it out to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and ſtrangers, with no ſmall advantage; which was ſo farre from unlawfull, as that he thereby merited the name of the Saviour of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">So the Vulgar renders <hi>Zapnath-paaneah</hi> Salvator mundi, Gen. 41. 45.</note> and if any worthy Patriot out of a like providence, ſhall before-hand gather up the commodities of his country into a publique Magazine
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53799:27"/>
for the common benefit and reliefe of the people, upon the pinch of an enſuing neceſſity, he is ſo farre out of the reach of cenſure, as that he well deſerves a ſtatue with the Inſcription of Publique Benefactor; So as it is not the mere act of Monopolizing that makes the thing unlawfull, but the ground and intention, and the manner of carriage.</p>
               <p>All Monopolies, as they are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally practiſed, are either ſuch as are allowed by Soveraigne authority, or privately contrived by ſecret plot and convention for a peculiar gaine to ſome ſpeciall perſons. If the firſt, it muſt be conſidered upon what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that priviledge is granted, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what termes; If both theſe be juſt, the grant can be no other. For firſt, it may not be denyed, that ſupreme authority, whether of Princes or States, hath power to grant ſuch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges where they ſhall find juſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53799:28"/>
cauſe; and ſecondly, that there may be very juſt motives of granting them to ſome capable and worthy perſons; I ſhould be a ſhamed to imagine that either of theſe ſhould need any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſſe then, there is manifeſt equity that where there hath beene ſome great merit, or charge, or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the compaſſing of ſome nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble worke for a common good, the undertaker ſhould be rewarded with a patent of a ſecured profit to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. As put caſe ſome wel-minded Printer (as one of the <hi>Stephens)</hi> is willing to be at an exceſſive charge in the faire publication of a learned and uſefull worke for the benefit of the preſent and following ages; it is moſt juſt that he ſhould from the hands of Princes or States receive a Priviledge for the ſole impreſſion; that he may recover, with advantage, the deep expence he hath beene at;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53799:28"/>
Otherwiſe ſome Interloper may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps underhand fall upon the work at a lower rate, and undoe the firſt editor; whoſe induſtry, care and coſt ſhall thus be recompenced with the ruine of himſelfe and his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as were too eaſie to inſtance.</p>
               <p>If a man have by notable dexterity of wit, and art; and much labour and charge after many experiments, atained to the skill of making ſome rare engine of excellent uſe for the ſervice of his Prince and Countrey, as ſome ſingular water worke; or ſome beneficiall inſtrument for the freeing of navigable rivers from their ſandy obſtructions, it is all the reaſon in the world, that by the juſt bounty of Princes he ſhould be ſo farre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munerated as that he alone may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a patent of enjoying a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his owne invention.</p>
               <p>But how farre it may be lawfull for a Prince not onely to gratifie a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53799:29"/>
well-deſerving Subject, with the ſee of his owne deviſe, but with a profit ariſing from the ſole ſale of marketa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble commodities through his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; or whether, and how farre in the want of monies for the neceſſary ſervice of his State, he may for the publique uſe, raiſe, ſet, or ſell mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies of that kind, is diverſly agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Caſuiſts; and muſt receive anſwer according to the abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or limitation of thoſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, under which they are practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: But with this, that where this is done, there may be great care had of a juſt price to be ſet upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities ſo reſtrained, that they be not left to the lawleſſe will of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged engroſſer, nor heightned to an undue rate by reaſon of a particular indulgence.</p>
               <p>This may be enough for authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Monopolies. The common ſort of offenſive practices this way
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53799:29"/>
are private and ſingle, or conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall, and plotted by combination; The former, as when ſome covetous extortioner out of the ſtrength of his purſe buyes up the whole lading of the ſhip, that he may have the ſole power of the wares to ſell them at pleaſure, which, there is no feare but he will doe with rigour enough: The true judgment of which action, &amp; the degrees of the malignity of it, muſt be fetcht, as from the mind, ſo from the management of the buyer; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much more ſinfull, as it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes more of oppreſſion. The latter, when ſome brethren in evill conſpire to prevent the harveſt, to buy up, or hoord up the graine; with a purpoſe to ſtarve the market, and to hatch up a dearth: A damnable practice in both kinds; and that which hath of old beene branded with a curſe; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſſe full of injuſtice then uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſſe; and that which cryes
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53799:30"/>
aloud, for a juſt puniſhment, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory reſtitution.</p>
               <p>I cannot therefore but marvaile at the opinion of learned <hi>Leſsius</hi> (which he fathers alſo upon <hi>Molina)</hi> that too favourably minces the hainouſneſſe of this ſin; bearing us in hand that it is indeed an offence againſt charity, and common profit, but not againſt particular Juſtice. His reaſon: To buy that corne (ſaith he) could not be againſt juſtice, for he bought it at the current price: Nor yet to ſell it, could be againſt juſtice, becauſe he was not tyed out of juſtice at that time to bring it forth to ſale: When he might eaſily have conſidered, that it is not the mere act of buying, or of not ſelling, that in it ſelfe is accuſed for unjuſt; but to buy, or not to ſell, with an intention, and iſſue of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing others, and undue enriching themſelves by a dearth. For what can be more unjuſt then for a man to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53799:30"/>
indevor to raiſe himſelfe by the affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing of others?</p>
               <p>Neither can it ſerve his turne to ſay, by way of excuſe, that the multitude of buyers may be the cauſe of a dearth, and yet without ſin; ſince they doe rather occaſion, then cauſe a ſcarcity; and are ſo farre from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a dearth in making their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, that they deprecate it, as their great affliction.</p>
               <p>And if, by his owne confeſſion, thoſe who either by force, or fraud hinder the importation of corne, that a dearth may continue, are guilty of injuſtice, and are bound to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution both to the Commonwealth in giving cauſe to raiſe the price; as alſo to the Merchant, whom they have hindered, of his meet gaine; how can thoſe be liable to a leſſe ſin, or puniſhment, that either buy up, or wilfully keep in, their graine with a purpoſe to begin, and hold on a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53799:31"/>
dearth? and what leſſe can it be then force or fraud, that by their crafty and cruel prevention the poor are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to want that ſuſtenance, whereby their life ſhould be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained?</p>
               <p>Wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhall ſhut up this Scene for me. <hi>He that with-holds corne, the People ſhall curſe him, but bleſsings ſhall be upon the head of him that ſelleth it.</hi> Prov. 11. 26.</p>

If in the maine ſubſtance of the thing ſold, the bargaine is both by the very law of nature, and in conſcience, void; yea indeed, none at all: as if a man have ſold you copper lace for gold; or alchymie-plate for ſilver; the reaſon is well given by <note n="*" place="bottom">Leſſius l. 2. c. 17. dub. 5.</note> Caſuiſts: There is no bargaine without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and here is no conſent at all, whiles both parties pitch not upon the ſame ſubject; the buyer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds to himſelfe gold and ſilver, the ſeller obtrudes copper, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymie; the one therefore not buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the other pretended to ſell, here is no bargaine made, but a mere act of cozenage, juſtly liable to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment by all lawes of God and

               <p>It is very memorable in this kinde that <hi>Cicero</hi> relates to us of a fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent bargaine betwixt <note n="*" place="bottom">Cicer. de Offic. l. 3. Sect. 58.</note> 
                  <hi>Canius,</hi> a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Knight and Orator, and one <hi>Pythius</hi> a Banker of <hi>Syracuſe. Canius</hi> comming upon occaſion of pleading

to the city of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> tooke a great liking to the place; and ſetling there, gave out that he had a great deſire to buy ſome one of thoſe pleaſant gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, wherewith, it ſeems, that city abounded; that he might there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create himſelfe when he pleaſed, with his friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pythius</hi> a crafty merchant hearing of it, ſends word to <hi>Canius,</hi> that he had a fair garden which he had no minde to ſell; but if he pleaſed to make uſe of it for his ſolace, he might command it as his owne; and withall courteouſly invites <hi>Canius</hi> to ſup with him there the day following: In the meane time being a man by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his trade of exchange, very gracious in the city, he calls the fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermen together, and deſires them that the next evening they would fiſh in the ſtream before his garden, and bring him, what they ſhall have caught; <hi>Canius</hi> in due time comes
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53799:33"/>
according to the invitation, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; where there was delicate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion made for him by <hi>Pythius;</hi> and ſtore of boats bringing in their plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull draughts of fiſh, and caſting them downe at the feet of <hi>Pythius: Canius</hi> askes the meaning of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Fiſhermen, and ſtore of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered proviſion? <hi>Pythius</hi> tells him this is the commodity and priviledge of the place, if <hi>Syracuſe</hi> yeeld any fiſh, here it is caught, and here ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; <hi>Canius</hi> beleeving the report, importunes his hoſt to ſell him the ground: the owner after ſome ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loathneſſe, and ſqueamiſh relucta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at laſt yeelds to gratifie him with the bargaine: The deare price is payd downe with much eagerneſſe. The new maſter of the place, in much pride of his purchaſe, the next day repaires early to his garden, invites his friends to a friday feaſt; and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no boat there, asks the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53799:33"/>
whether it were holiday with the fiſhermen, that he ſaw none of them there; No, ſaid the good man, none that I know; but none of the trade uſe to fiſh here; and I much marvailed at the ſtrange confluence of their boats here yeſterday: The Roman Orator was downe in the mouth; finding himſelfe thus cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the money-changer: but, for ought I ſee, had his amends in his hands; He meant, and deſired to buy the place, though without any ſuch accommodation; but over-bought it upon the falſe pretence of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent commodity; the injury was the ſellers, the loſſe muſt be the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>But if ſuch be the caſe, that you are meerly drawne in by the fraud, and would not have bought the commodity at all, if you had not beene induced by the deceit, and falſe oathes and warrants of the ſeller, you
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53799:34"/>
have juſt reaſon, either, if you may, to fall off from the bargaine; or, if the matter be valuable, to require a juſt ſatisfaction from the ſeller; who is bound in conſcience either by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling the bargaine, or abatement of price to make good your indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>In theſe matters of contract there is great reaſon to diſtinguiſh betwixt a willing deceit, and an involuntary wrong; If a man ſhall fraudulently ſell an horſe which he knowes ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and incurably diſeaſed, to another for ſound; and that other, beleeving the ſellers deep proteſtation, ſhall upon the ſame price, <hi>bonâ fide,</hi> put him off to me; I feel my ſelf injured, but whither ſhall I go for an amends? I cannot challenge the immediate ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, for he deceived me not; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not challenge the deceiver, for he dealt not with me; In humane lawes, I am left remedileſſe; but in the law of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53799:34"/>
conſcience, the firſt ſeller, who ought to have born his own burthen of an inevitable loſſe, is bound to transferre by the hands that ſold me that injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bargaine, a due ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Neither is it other of fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent conveyances in the houſes or land, how ever the matter may be intricated by paſſing through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perhaps unknowing hands, yet the ſinne and obligation to ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will neceſſarily lie at the firſt door; whence if juſt reſtitution doe not follow, the ſeller may purchaſe Hell to boot.</p>
               <p>Think not now on this diſcourſe that the onely fraud is in ſelling; there may be no leſſe (though not ſo frequent) fraud in buying alſo; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in unjuſt payment, by falſe coyne; or by injuſtice of quantities, as in buying by weights, or meaſures above allowance; or by wrong valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſubſtance &amp; quality of the

commodity, misknown by the ſeller; As for inſtance, A ſimple man, as I have known it done in the Weſterne parts, findes a parcell of Ambergris caſt upon the ſands; he perceiving it to be ſome unctuous matter, puts it to the baſe uſe of his ſhooes, or his cart wheel; a merchant that ſmels the worth of the ſtuffe buyes it of him for a ſmall ſumme; giving him a ſhilling or two, for that which himſelfe knowes to be worth twenty pounds: the bargaine is fraudulent; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a proportionable compenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ignorant ſeller, into whoſe hands providence hath caſt ſo rich a booty.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>REſtitution is a duty no leſſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, then rarely practiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians. The Arch-publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can <hi>Zacheus</hi> knew that with this he muſt begin his converſion; and that known rule of Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Aug. epiſt. 54. ad Macedon.</note> is in every mans mouth, No remiſſion without reſtitution. For this act is no ſmall piece of commutative Juſtice; which requires that every man ſhould have his owne: Moſt juſt therefore it is, that what you have taken, or
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53799:36"/>
detained from the true owner ſhould be reſtored; neither can it be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that you have conceived a drye and bootleſſe ſorrow for your wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full detention, unleſſe you alſo make amends to him by a reall compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But you are diſabled to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution by reaſon of want, your will is good, but the neceſſity into which you are fallen, makes you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of performance: See firſt, that it be a true, and not fained ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; Many a one, like to leud criples that pretend falſe ſoares, counterfeit a need that is not, and ſhelter themſelves in a willing Jaile, there living merrily upon their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded creditor, whom they might honeſtly ſatisfie by a well improved libertie: This caſe is damnably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; but if it be a true neceſſity of Gods making, it muſt excuſe you for the time; till the ſame hand that did
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53799:36"/>
caſt you downe, ſhall be pleaſed to raiſe you up againe; then, you are bound to ſatifie; and in the meane time, lay the caſe truly before your creditor, who if he be not mercileſſe, where he ſees a reall deſire, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour of ſatisfaction, will imitate his God in accepting the will for the deed: and wait patiently for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of your eſtate.</p>
               <p>You ask now, to whom you ſhould tender reſtitution?</p>
               <p>To whom, but the owner? But he, you ſay, is dead; That will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe you; he lives ſtill in his heires; It is memorable (though in a ſmall matter) which <hi>Seneca</hi> reports of a Pythagorean Philoſopher at <hi>Athens,</hi> who having run upon the ſcore for his ſhoos at a ſhop there; hearing that the ſhoomaker was dead, at firſt was glad to think the debt was now paid; but ſtraight recollecting himſelfe, he ſayes within himſelf; Yet, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53799:37"/>
the ſhoomaker lives ſtill to thee, though dead to others; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon puts his money into the ſhop, as ſuppoſing that both of them would find an owner. It is a rare caſe that a man dies, and leaves no body in whom his right ſurvives: But if there be neither heire, nor executor, nor adminiſtrator, nor aſſigne; the poor (ſaith our Saviour) ye ſhall have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with you; Make thou them his heire: Turne your debt into almes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But alas you ſay; I am poor my ſelf, what need I then look forth for any other? Why may not I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my reſtitution to the reliefe of my owne neceſſity?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> It is dangerous, and cannot be juſt for a man to be his owne carver altogether in a buſineſs of this nature; You muſt look upon this money, as no more yours then a ſtrangers; and howſoever it be moſt true that every
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53799:37"/>
man is neareſt to himſelfe, and hath reaſon to wiſh to be a ſharer, where the need is equall; yet it is fit this ſhould be done with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and approbation of others: Your Paſtor, and thoſe other that are by authority intereſſed in theſe publique cares, are fit to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the caſe; (if it be in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meet to be notified) as a buſineſſe of debt or pecuniary ingagement let their wiſdome proportion the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution; But if it be in the caſe of ſome ſecret crime, as of theft, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenage, which you would keep as cloſe as your own heart, the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be charged upon your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to be made with ſo much more impartiality, as you deſire it more to be concealed; Herein have a care of your ſoul, what ever becomes of your eſtate.</p>
               <p>As for the time of reſtitution it is eaſily determined, that it cannot
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53799:38"/>
well be too ſoone for the diſcharge of your conſcience, it may be too late for the occaſions of him to whom it is due; Although it may fall out that it may prove more fit to deferre for the good of both: wherein cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and juſtice muſt be called in as arbitrators; The owner calls for his money in a riotous humour to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend it upon his unlawfull pleaſure; if your delay may prevent the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, the forbearance is an act of mercy: The owner calls for a ſword depoſited with you, which you have cauſe to ſuſpect he meanes to make uſe of, for ſome ill purpoſe; your forbearing to reſtore it is ſo both cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and juſt, that your act of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of it may make you acceſſary to a murther. Whereto I may adde, that in the choice of the time, you may lawfully have ſome reſpect to your ſelfe; for if the preſent reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be to your utter undoing,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53799:38"/>
which may be avoided by ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable delay, you have no reaſon to ſhun anothers inconvenience by your own inevitable ruine; in ſuch caſe let the creditor be acquainted with the neceſſity, his offence deprecated; and rather put your ſelfe upon the mercy of a Chancery, then be guilty of your owne overthrow.</p>
               <p>But when the power is in your hand, and the coaſt every way clear, let not anothers mans goods or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſtick to your fingers; and think not that your head can long lye eaſily upon anothers mans pillow.</p>
               <p>Yea, but you ſay the money or goods miſ-carried, either by robbery or falſe truſt, ere you could employ them to any profit at all; This will not excuſe you; after they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your power, you are reſponſible for them; What compaſſion this may work in the good nature of the owner for the favour of an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53799:39"/>
muſt be left to his own breſt; your tye to reſtitution is not the leſſe; For it is ſuppoſed, had they remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the owners hands they had been ſafe; if it were not your fault, yet it was your croſſe, that they miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; and who ſhould bear your croſſe but your ſelf?</p>
               <p>Shortly then, after all pretences of excuſe; the charge of wiſe <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> muſt be obeyed: <hi>VVith-hold not good from the owners thereof, when it is in the power of thine hand to doe it,</hi> Prov. 3. 17.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether, and how farre doth a promiſe extorted by fear, though ſeconded by an oath, bind my conſcience to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>A Mere promiſe is an honeſt mans ſtrong obligation; but if it be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53799:39"/>
withal backed with an oath, the bond is ſacred, and inviolable.</p>
               <p>But let me ask you what promiſe it is that you thus made, and bound; If it be of a thing unlawfull to be done, your promiſe and oath is ſo farre from binding you to perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, that it binds you onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance that ever you made it; In this caſe your performancee would double and heighten your ſin: It was ill to promiſe, but it would be worſe to performe: <hi>Herod</hi> is by oath ingaged for an indefinite favour to <hi>Salome;</hi> She pitches upon <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt's</hi> head; He was ſory for ſuch a choice, yet for his oaths ſake he thinkes he muſt make it good: Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Herod</hi> was ill-principled, that he could think a raſh oath muſt bind him to murder an innocent; He might have truly ſaid, this was more then he could doe; for that we can doe, which we can lawfully doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:53799:40"/>
But if it be a lawfull thing that you have thus promiſed, and ſworne; though the promiſe were unlawfully drawn from you by feare, I dare not perſwade you to violate it. It is true that divers learned Caſuiſts hold, that a promiſe drawne from a man by feare is void, or at leaſt revocable at pleaſure; and ſo alſo the oath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, which followes the nature of the act whereto it appends; chiefly upon this ground; that both theſe are done without conſent, mere invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary acts, ſince nothing can be ſo contrary to conſent as force and feare: But I dare not goe along with them; for that I apprehend there is not an abſolute involuntarineſſe in this ingagement, but a mixt one; ſuch as the <note n="*" place="bottom">Ariſt. Eth. l. 2. c. 2.</note> Philoſopher determines in the Mariner, that caſts his goods o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver board to ſave his life; in it ſelfe, he hath no will to doe it; but here
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53799:40"/>
and now upon this danger imminent, he hath an halfe-will to performe it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I build upon their owne ground; There is the ſame reaſon, they ſay, of force, and of fraud; now that a promiſe and oath drawne from us by fraud bindes ſtrongly, we need no other inſtance then that of <hi>Joſhua</hi> made to the <hi>Gibeonites;</hi> there could not be a greater fraud then lay hid in the old ſhooes, thred-bare garments, rent bottles, and mouldy proviſions of thoſe borderers; who under the pretence of a remote nation put themſelves under the intereſt and protection of <hi>Iſrael: Joſh.</hi> 9. 12, 13. &amp;c. the guile ſoone proved apparent, yet durſt not <hi>Joſhua,</hi> though he found himſelfe cheated into this covenant, fall off from the league made with them; which when, after many ages, <hi>Saul</hi> out of politique ends went about to have broken, we ſee how fearfully it was avenged with a grievous
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53799:41"/>
plague of famine upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even in <hi>Davids</hi> dayes, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 1. who was no way acceſſary to the oppreſſion; neither could be otherwiſe expiated then by the bleeding of <hi>Saul</hi>'s bloody houſe. When once we have inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed God in the buſineſſe, it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous not to be punctuall in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. If therefore a bold theefe taking you at an advantage have ſet his dagger to your breſt, and with big oathes threatned to ſtab you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you promiſe and ſweare to give him an hundred pounds to be left on ſuch a day in ſuch a place for him, I ſee not how (if you be able) you can diſpence with the performance; the onely help is, (which is well ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <note n="*" place="bottom">Leſſius de Jure, &amp;c. l. 2.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53799:41"/>
of a reall equivocation: why ſhould you not thus right your ſelfe, ſince you have onely tyed your ſelfe to a mere payment of the ſumme? upon ſtaking it downe for him, you are free. But if he have forc'd you to promiſe, and ſwear not to make him knowne, you are bound to be ſilent in this act, concerning your ſelfe; but withall, if you find that your ſilence may be prejudiciall to the publique good, for that you perceive the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſſe of the offender proceeds (and is like ſo to doe) to the like miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe unto others, you ought, though not to accuſe him for the fact done unto you; yet to give warning to ſome in authority to have a vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant eye upon ſo leud a perſon, for the prevention of any further vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany.</p>

he come not in, the ſooner, to be openly cryed in ſeverall markets, that the noiſe of his own neglected goods may come to his care: and if, upon a continuing ſilence, they be put into the Cuſtody of the Lord of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, (who is moſt likely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible) and he ſhall make uſe of them, before his year and day be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, he ſhall not doe it without ſome mark of diſtinction, that yet the true owner may know, they are not challenged by the preſent poſſeſſour, as his owne, but lye open to the juſt claime of their true maſter.</p>
               <p>But if they be dead commodities, as a jewell, a purſe, or ſome ring of price, or the like, the finder may not preſently ſmother up the propriety of it in his owne coſer; his heart tells him that the meer accident of his finding it, cannot alienate the juſt right of it from the true owner; he is therefore bound in conſcience, in an
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53799:44"/>
honeſt ſincerity to uſe all good means for the finding out of the right pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary, whether by ſecret inquiry, or open publication: and if after due inquiſition, no claime ſhall be made to it for the preſent, he ſhall reſerve it in his hand in expectation of a juſt challenge: upon the aſſurance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (how late ſoever) he is bound to reſtore it to the proper owner: who, on the other ſide, ſhall faile in his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of gratitude, if he returne not ſome meet acknowledgment of that good office, and fidelity: In all which mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall carriages, we ought to be guided by thoſe reſpects which we could wiſh tendered to our ſelves in the like occaſions. Mean while, in all the time of our cuſtody, we are to looke upon thoſe commodities as ſtrangers; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king account of ſuch a potentiall right onely in them, as we are ready and deſirous to reſigne to the hands that purchaſed and loſt them. On
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53799:44"/>
the contrary, no words can expreſſe the horrible cruelty and injuſtice that is wont to be done in this kinde, not onely on our ſhores, but in other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions alſo, upon the ſhip-wracked goods both of ſtrangers, and our own compatriots; whiles in ſtead of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſioning and relieving the loſſe, and miſeries of our diſtreſſed brethren, every man is ready to run upon the ſpoile, and, as if it were from ſome plundered enemy, is eagerly buſie in carrying away what riches ſoever come to hand, which they falſly, and injuriouſly term <hi>Gods Grace,</hi> when as indeed it is no other then the Devils booty. This practice can paſſe for no other then a meere robbery, ſo much more haynous, as the condition of the miſ-carried owner is more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: What a foul inhumanity is this, to perſecute him whom God hath ſmitten; and upon no other quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell to be cruell to our brother, then

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether may it be lawfull, in caſe of extremity, to procure the abortion of the child, for the preſervation of the mother?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Fear want of true judgement ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders too many of the weaker ſexe groſſely culpable in matter of willing abortion; whiles, being not well principled either in nature, or grace, they thinke it not unlawfull, or at leaſt, venially ſo, whether out of the fear of painfull child-birth, or for the avoidance of too great a charge, to prevent the fulneſſe of their conceptions; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, either by over-vehement moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or unwholſome medicine, are not unwilling to foreſt all nature, and to free themſelves early of that which might in time prove their burden: Wherein they little know how highly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53799:57"/>
they offend the Majeſty of God in deſtroying his potentiall creature, and how heavy weight of guilt they lay upon their ſoules, whiles they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to give an undue eaſe to their bodies.</p>
               <p>Your queſtion ſuppoſes an extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; and ſurely ſuch it had need to be, that may warrant the intention of ſuch an event.</p>
               <p>For the deciding whereof, our Caſuiſts are wont to diſtinguiſh double; both of the ſtate of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; and of the nature of the receit: In the former; they conſider of the Conception, either as it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it receive life, or after that it is animated: Before it receive life, they are wont to determine, that howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it were no leſſe then mortall ſin, in a Phyſitian, to preſcribe a medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall receit to cauſe abortion, for the hiding of a ſinne, or any outward ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular occaſion; yet for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53799:57"/>
of the life of the mother, in an extreme danger, (I ſay, before ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) it might be lawfull: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life once received, it were an hain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſinne to adminiſter any ſuch mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall remedy. The latter Caſuiſts are better adviſed; and juſtly hold that to give any ſuch expelling or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive medicine, with a direct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to work an aborſement, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before, or after animation) is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unlawfull, and highly ſinfull: And with them I cannot but concur in opinion; For, after conception we know that naturally followes anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is only the time that makes the difference; which in this caſe is not ſo conſiderable, as to take off a ſinne: That of <note n="*" place="bottom">Tertul. in Apol. c. 9.</note>

               <p>And if you tell me that the life of the mother might thus be preſerved, whereas otherwiſe both ſhe and all the poſſibilities of further concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are utterly loſt; I muſt anſwer you with that ſure and univerſall rule of the Apoſtle, that <hi>we may not doe evill that good may come thereon,</hi> Rom. 3. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:53799:58"/>
The ſecond conſideration is of the nature of the receit, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the preſcriber; There are preſcripts that may, in, and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves tend towards cure, and may have ordinarily ſuch an effect; but yet being uſed and applyed for the mothers remedy, may prove the loſſe of the conception, being yet inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; theſe if they be given with no other intention then the preſervation of the mothers life, may be capable of excuſe; for that the inconvenience (or miſchief rather) which followed upon the receits was accidentall, and utterly againſt the mind, and hopes of him that adviſed them.</p>
               <p>But if the conception be once formed, and animated, the queſtion will be ſo much more difficult, as the proceedings of nature are more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: Whereupon it is, that the Septuagint in their Tranſlation (as <hi>Leſsius</hi> well obſerves) have rendred

               <p>In this caſe of the conception ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, I find the Caſuiſts much divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; Whiles ſome more tender then their fellowes, will not allow in the utmoſt extremity of a dying mother, a medicine that may be directly cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to be given her, if it ſhould be with any apparent danger of the child; in caſe that the child may be probably drawne forth alive; which they doe upon this falſe and bloodily uncharitable ground, <note n="*" place="bottom">Vel. ut alii, <hi>Quorum animae certiſſimè in limbum deſcendunt ſine Baptiſmo.</hi> Mart.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53799:60"/>
though not without ſome perill of the child.</p>
               <p>But all this while, the intentions, and indeavours muſt be no other then preſervatory; however it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God to order the events: Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no man that purpoſely procureth an abortion, as ſuch, can waſh his hands from blood; No woman that wilfully acts, or ſuffers it, (how ever the ſecrecy may exempt her from the danger of humane lawes) can thinke to avoid thoſe judgments of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God, which he hath charged upon murderers.</p>
               <p>I cannot here therefore forbeare to give the world notice of the impious indulgence of a late Pope in this kind; <hi>Sixtus quintus,</hi> who in our time ſat in the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> finding the horrible effects of that liberty, which too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny both ſecular and religious perſons tooke to themſelves in this matter of abortion; in a juſt deteſtation of that

is to wait in priſon for the ſtroak, if he may avoid it; it is enough that he patiently ſubmits to what the law forces upon him, though he doe not cooperate to his owne deſtruction: his ſentence abridges him of power, not of will to depart: Whereupon they have gone ſo far, as to hold it in point of conſcience not unlawfull for the friends of the impriſoned, to conveigh unto him files, and cords, or other inſtruments uſefull for their eſcape: But herein ſome better-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed Doctors have juſtiy diſſented from them; as thoſe, whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath not beene more favourable to malefactors, then dangerous and prejudiciall to the Commonwealth: for how ſafe ſoever this might ſeeme in lighter treſpaſſes, yet if this might be allowed as in conſcience lawfull to be done to the reſcue of murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, traytors, or ſuch other flagitious villains, what infinite miſchiefe might

it produce? and what were this other then to invite men to be acceſſary to thoſe crimes, which the law in a due way intends to puuiſh? Certainly, by how much a more laudable act of Juſtice it is, to free the ſociety of men from ſuch wicked miſcreants, by ſo much more ſinfull and odious an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it were, to uſe theſe ſiniſter means for their exemption from the due courſe of Juſtice; But howſoever for another man to yeeld ſuch unlawfull aid, is no better then a foule affront of publique Juſtice, and enwrappes the agent in a partnerſhip of crime; yet the law of nature puts this liberty upon the reſtrained party himſelfe, both to wiſh and indeavour his owne deliverance: Although not ſo; but that if the priſoner have ingaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by ſolemne promiſe, and oath to his keeper, not to depart out of his cuſtody; honeſty muſt prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove nature; and he ought rather
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53799:64"/>
to die, then violate that bond which is ſtronger then his irons: Very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens have by their example taught us this leſſon; To regard our fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, more then our life: Thus it ſhould be, and is, with thoſe that are truly Chriſtian and ingenuous, under what ever captivity; but in the caſe of graceleſſe and felonious perſons, Gaolers have reaſon to looke to their bolts and lockes; knowing (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the old rule of wiſe <hi>Thales)</hi> that he who hath not ſtuck at one vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie, will eaſily ſwallow another; perjury will eaſily downe with him, that hath made no bones of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>But where the caſe is entire, no man can blame a captive if he would be free; and if he may untie the knot of a cord, wherewith he was bound; why may he not unrivet, or grate an iron wherewith he is fettered? for ſo much as he is not bound, to yeeld,

               <p>AN Oath, as it is a ſacred thing, ſo it muſt be no otherwiſe then holily uſed; whether on the part of the giver, or taker; &amp; therefore may neither raſhly be uttered, nor unduly tendered upon ſleight, or unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table occaſions: We have not to doe here with a promiſſory oath, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation whereof is for another inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; It is the aſſertory oath that is now under our hand; which the great God by whom we ſweare, hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be an end of controverſies; <hi>At the mouth of two or three witneſſes ſhall the matter be establiſhed, Deuter. 19. 15. &amp;</hi> 17. 6. As for ſecular ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of <hi>mine,</hi> or <hi>thine,</hi> the propriety of goods, or lands, next after written evidences, teſtimonies upon Oath
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53799:66"/>
muſt needs be held moſt fitly deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; the onely ſcruples are wont to be made in cauſes criminall.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wherein ſurely we may lay this undoubted ground, that no man is to be proceeded againſt without an accuſer, and that accuſation muſt be made good by lawfull witneſſes: A Judge may not caſt any man upon the plea of his owne eye-ſight: ſhould this liberty be granted, Innocence might ſuffer, and Malice triumph: Neither may any man be condemned upon heare-ſay; which how common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe it is, daily experience ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently evinceth.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, men are apt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to connive at each others wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe; and every man is loath to be an Informer, whether out of the envy of the office, or out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of his owne obnoxiouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>And yet thirdly, it is requiſite that care ſhould be taken, and all due
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53799:67"/>
meanes uſed by authority, that the world may not be over-run with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe; but that vice may be found out, repreſſed, puniſhed.</p>
               <p>There cannot, fourthly, be deviſed a fairer, and more probable courſe for the effecting hereof, then by the diſcovery upon oaths of the officers and Jurors in Aſſiſes, and Seſſions; and of Churchwardens, and Side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in Viſitations.</p>
               <p>The ground of all preſentments to, or by theſe men muſt be either their owne knowledge, or publique fame, or an avowed information. Any of theſe gives a lawful hint to the Judge, whether Eccleſiaſticall or Civill, to take full triall of the cauſe and perſon.</p>
               <p>Knowledge is alwayes certaine, but fame is often a lyar; and therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very idle rumour muſt not be ſtraight taken upon truſt; the inconvenience and injury whereof I have often
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53799:67"/>
ſeene; when ſome malicious perſon deſiring to doe a deſpight to an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent neighbour, raiſes a cauſeleſſe ſlander againſt him, whiſpers it to ſome diſ-affected Goſſips, this flyes to the care of an Apparitor; hee ſtraight runs to the Office, and ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts a publique fame; the honeſt man is called into the Court; his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is blurred in being but ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned; and after all his trouble and diſgrace hath his amends in his owne hands.</p>
               <p>The rule of ſome Caſuiſts, that ten tongues make a fame, is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and inſufficient; neither is the number ſo much to be regarded as the quality of the perſons.</p>
               <p>If a whole pack of debauched companions ſhall conſpire to ſtaine the good name of an innocent (as we have the often knowne) it were a ſhamefull injuſtice to allow them the authors of a fame: the more judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53799:68"/>
Doctors have defined a publique fame by the voyce of the greater part of that Community, wherein it is ſpread, whether Towne, Pariſh, City: and therein of thoſe that are diſcreet, honeſt, well behaved. We are wont to ſay, Where there is much ſmoke, there is likely ſome fire: an univerſall report from ſuch mouthes, therefore, may well give occaſion to a further inquiry. If any mans zeale againſt vice will make it a matter of inſtance, the caſe is cleare, and the proceeding unqueſtionable; But if it be matter of mere office, the carriage of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe may be liable to doubt; Herein it is meet ſuch courſe be taken, as that neither a notorious evill may be ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, nor yet innocence injured: To which purpoſe the moſt confident reporter may be called upon (becauſe fame hath too many tongues to ſpeak at once) to lay forth the grounds of that his whiſpered crimination; and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53799:68"/>
if the circumſtances appeare preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the ſuſpicions ſtrong, I ſee not why the Eccleſiaſticall Judge (for with him onely in this caſe I profeſſe to meddle) may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the perſon accuſed, lay before him the crime which is ſecretly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon him; and either upon his ingenuous confeſſion, enjoyne him ſuch ſatisfaction to the ſcandalized Congregation as may be moſt fit, or upon his denyall urge him to cleare himſelfe by lawfull witneſſes, of the crime objected; Or why he may not, if he ſee further cauſe, appoint a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreet and able proſecutor to follow the buſineſſe in a legall way; upon whom the accuſed, if he be found guiltleſſe, may right himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But all this while, I finde no juſt place for an oath to be adminiſtred to a man for his owne accuſation; which certainly, is altogether both illegall, and unreaſonable; If a man
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53799:69"/>
will voluntarily offer to cleare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by an Oath, out of the aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his owne innocence, he may be allowed to be heard, but this may neither be preſſed to be done, nor yet concluſive, when it is done; for both every man is apt to be partiall in his owne caſe, and he that durſt act a foule ſin will dare to face it. It was ever therefore lawfull (even when Eccleſiaſtical Inquiſitions were at the higheſt) for a man to refuſe anſwer to ſuch queſtions upon oath, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, which tended to his owne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment; as unjuſtly, and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably propoſed: and it was but a young determination of <note n="*" place="bottom">Silveſtr.

               <p>Even the Spaniſh Caſuiſts, the great favourers and abettors of the Inquiſition, teach that the Judge may not of himſelfe begin an inquiry, but muſt be led by ſomething which may open a way to his ſearch, and as it were force him to his proceeding, <hi>ex officio,</hi> as publique notice, infamie, common ſuſpicion, complaint; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the whole proceſſe is void in law; although herein ſome of them goe too far in favour of their great <hi>Diana,</hi> that where the crime is known, and the author unknowne, the Judge may in a generality inquire of him that did it, and if he have any private information (though without any publique fame foregoing) he may in fome caſes, raiſe a particular inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition upon the party, and call him to defend himſelfe; which courſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53799:70"/>
certainly, gives too much advantage to private malice; and opens too much way to the wronging of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether a Judge may upon allegations, proofes, and evidences of others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne a man to death, whom he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe certainly knows to be innocent.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe queſtion hath undergone much agitation; The ſtreame of all ancient Divines, and Caſuiſts runs upon the affirmative; their ground is, that the Judge as he is a publique perſon, ſo in the ſeat of Judicature he muſt exerciſe a publique autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and therefore waving his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate knowledge and intereſt, muſt ſentence according to the allegations and proofes brought before him; ſince he is a Judge of the cauſe, not of the law; whereof he is to be the ſervant, not the maſter: There he ſits not to ſpeake his owne judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but to be the mouth of the law, and the law commands him to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53799:71"/>
judge according to the evidence; the evidence therefore being cleare and convictive, the doome can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then condemnatory.</p>
               <p>For my part, I can more marvell at their judgement herein, then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it; profeſſing for the negative, with ſome fewer and latter Authors, upon theſe ſure grounds.</p>
               <p>It is an evident and undeniable law of God which muſt be the rule of all Judges; <hi>The innocent and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſlay thou not, Exod.</hi> 23. 7. This is a Law neither to be avoided, nor, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed with: Accuſations and falſe witneſſes cannot make a man other then innocent; they may make him to ſeeme ſo; in ſo much as thoſe that know not the cauſe exactly, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be miſ-led to condemne him, in their judgments: But to the Judge, whoſe eyes were witneſſes of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties innocence, all the evidence in the world cannot make him other then
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53799:71"/>
guiltleſſe; ſo as that Judge ſhall be guilty of blood, in ſlaying the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and righteous.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the law of judging ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to allegations and proofs is a good generall direction in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courſe of proceedings; but there are caſes wherein this law muſt vaile to an higher, which is the law of Conſcience: Woe be to that man who ſhall tye himſelfe ſo cloſe to the letter of the law, as to make ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of conſcience; And that bird in his boſome will tell him, that if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what ever pretences, he ſhall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly condemne an innocent, he is no better then a murtherer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is not the bare letter of the law that wiſe men ſhould ſtand upon, but the drift and intention of the law; of that, we may in ſome ſenſe ſay as the Apoſtle did of an higher law, <hi>The letter killeth.</hi> Now every reaſonable man knowes that the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53799:72"/>
intention of the law, is to ſave and protect the Innocent; to puniſh one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the guilty: The Judge therefore ſhall be a perverter of law, if, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his knowledge, he ſhall follow the letter againſt the intention, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning an Innocent.</p>
               <p>Let no man now tell me, that it is the law that condemnes the man, and not the Judge; This excuſe will not ſerve before the Tribunal of heaven; The law hath no tongue; It is the Judge that is <hi>lex loquens;</hi> If he then ſhall pronounce that ſentence which his owne heart tells him is unjuſt and cruell, what is he but an officious mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of injuſtice? But, indeed, what law ever ſaid, Thou ſhalt kill that man whom thou knoweſt innocent, if falſe witneſſe will ſwear him guilty? This is but a falſe gloſſe ſet upon a true text, to countenance a man in being an inſtrument of evill.</p>
               <p>What then is in this caſe to be
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53799:72"/>
done? Surely, as I durſt not acquit that Judge, who under what ever co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of law ſhould caſt away a known Innocent, ſo I durſt not adviſe againſt plaine evidences and flat diſpoſitions, upon private knowledge, that man to be openly pronounced guiltleſſe; and thereby diſcharged; for as the one is a groſſe violation of juſtice; ſo were the other a publique affront to the law; and of dangerous conſequence to the weale-publique: Certainly, it could not but be extreamly unſafe, that ſuch a gappe ſhould be opened to the liberty of judgement, that a private breſt ſhould be oppoſed (with an apparent prevalence) againſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique convictions: Our Caſuiſts have beaten their brains to find out ſome ſuch evaſions, as might ſave the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent from death, &amp; the Judge from blood-guiltineſſe: Herein therefore they adviſe the Judge to uſe ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret meanes to ſtop the accuſation
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53799:73"/>
or indictment; (a courſe that might be as prejudiciall to juſtice, as a falſe ſentence) To ſift the witneſſes apart, as in <hi>Suſannaes</hi> caſe, and by many ſubtile interogations of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to find their variance or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. If that prevaile not, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jetan</hi> goes ſo farre, as to determine it meet (which how it might ſtand with their law, he knowes, with ours it would not) that the Judge ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the people give his oath, that he knows the party guiltleſſe; as whom he himſelfe ſaw at that very hour in a place far diſtant from that, wherein the fact is pretended to be done: Yea <note n="*" place="bottom">Dom. à Sot. de Jure, &amp;c. l. 5. qu. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Dominicus à Soto</hi> could be content (if it might be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcandall) that the priſoner might ſecretly be ſuffered to ſlip out of the gaole, and ſave himſelf by flight. Others think it the beſt way, that the Judge ſhould put off the cauſe to a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53799:73"/>
Bench; and that himſelfe ſhould (laying aſide his ſcarlet) come to the Bar, and as a witneſſe avow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on oath the innocence of the party, and the falſity of the accuſation: Or laſtly, if he ſhould out of malice, or ſome other ſiniſter ends (as of the forfaiture of ſome rich eſtate) be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by higher powers to paſſe the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence on his owne Bench, that he ought to lay downe his Commiſſion, and to abdicate that power he hath, rather then to ſuffer it forced to a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling injuſtice.</p>
               <p>And truly were the caſe mine, after all faire and lawfull indevours to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify the innocent, and to avoid the ſentence, I ſhould moſt willingly yeeld to this laſt reſolution: Yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my ſelfe to undergoe the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death, then to pronounce it on the knowne-guiltleſſe; hating the poore puſillanimity of <hi>Dominicus à

               <p>But what a looſe point is this?
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53799:75"/>
why hath not a man, as true propiety in his eſtate as his life? or what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority hath the Common-wealth, cauſeleſly to take away a mans ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or inheritance (being that he is the rightfull owner) more then a piece of himſelfe? When his patrimony is ſetled upon him and his in a due courſe of law and undoubted right of poſſeſſion, what juſt power can claim any ſuch intereſt in it as without any ground of offence to diſpoſſeſſe him? Or what neceſſity is there that the form of publique judgements ſhould be perverted, unleſſe an honeſt defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent muſt be undone by falſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence? Or rather is not the forme of publique judgement perverted, when innocence ſuffers for the maintenance of a formality? Or how is the Judge other then a partner in the injury, if for want of his ſeaſonable interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a good cauſe is loſt, and a falſe plea prevailes?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:53799:75"/>
That therefore, which in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place he alledgeth, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject can have no reaſon to complaine of the Judge, for as much as it is out of his power to remedy the caſe, and to paſſe other ſentence then is chalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth by the rule of law; might as well be alledged againſt him in the plea of life and death, wherein he will by no meanes allow the Judge this liberty of an undue condemnation; neither is there any juſt pretence why an honeſt and well-minded Judge ſhould be ſo ſparing in a caſe of life, and ſo too prodigall in matter of livelyhood.</p>
               <p>As for his third reaſon, that the miſ-judgment in caſe of a pecuniary damage or baniſhment, may be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards capable of being reverſed, and upon a new Traverſe the cauſe may be fetcht about at further leaſure; whereas death once inflicted is paſt all power of revocation; It may well

inferre that therefore there ſhould be ſo much more deliberation, and care had in paſſing ſentence upon capitall matters, then civill, by how much life is more precious, and irrevocable, then our worldly ſubſtance; but it can never inferre that injuſtice ſhould be tolerable in the one, not in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Juſtice had wont to be painted blindfold, with a paire of ſcales in her hand; wherefore elſe, but to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that he who would judge aright, muſt not look upon the iſſue or event, but muſt weigh impartially the true ſtate of the cauſe in all the grounds, and circumſtances thereof, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence accordingly?

               <p>But when the hand of God hath once found out the man in his ſinne; and he finds himſelfe legally convinced of his crime; it greatly behoves him (as <hi>Joſhua</hi> charged <hi>Achan</hi> after the lot had diſcovered his ſin) to give glory to God, in a free and full confeſſion of his wickedneſſe, and to be more open and ingenuous in his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment,

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53799:84"/>
of life and death; which both muſt lye at the publique ſtake in warre.</p>
               <p>That none but a juſt and weighty cauſe can be the ground of a warre, every mans reaſon apprehends; for how precious a bleſſing had that need to bee, that is held worth the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with the price of ſo much bloud; and how heavy a curſe muſt that needs be, which can onely be remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or prevented by ſo grievous a judgment as warre?</p>
               <p>That due termes and conditions are requiſite to be offered ere warre be undertaken; and obſerved in the managing, and ceaſing of it, huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it ſelfe teacheth us; without which men ſhould run upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with no leſſe fury and diſorder then beaſts; not ſtaying for any capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation but the firſt advantage; nor terminating their diſcord in any thing but utter deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Where all or any of theſe are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53799:85"/>
the warre cannot be juſt: and where it is known not to be ſuch, woe be to thoſe hands that are willingly active in proſecuting it.</p>
               <p>Now the care of all theſe three maine requiſites muſt lie chiefly upon that Power which is entruſted by the Almighty with the over-ruling of publique affaires: For the Subject, as he is bound to an implicite reliance upon the command of the ſupreme power; ſo (unleſſe it be in a caſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly apparent to be unjuſt) muſt yeeld a blindfold obedience to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; going whither he is led, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he is bidden; But if the caſe be ſuch, as that his heart is fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the injuſtice of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and that he clearly finds that he is charged to ſmite Innocence and to fight againſt God; I cannot blame him, if with <hi>Sauls</hi> footmen (when they were commanded to fall upon the Prieſts of the Lord) he withhold
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53799:85"/>
his hand, and craving pardon, ſhow leſſe readineſſe to act, then to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, I muſt aske you with what intentions you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe your ſelfe to the field; If it be out of the conſcience of maintaining a juſt cauſe, if out of a loyall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to lawfull authority: I ſhall bid you go on, and proſper: but if either malice to the parties oppoſed, and therein deſire of revenge, or a baſe covetouſneſſe of pay, or hope and deſire of pluuder have put you into armes: repent and withdraw: For what can be more ſordid, or cruell, then to be hired for dayes-wages to ſhed innocent blood?

warrantable authority hath put the ſword into your hand; you may uſe it.

To will or attempt this is highly injurious to that God, whoſe we one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are; who hath committed our life as a moſt precious thing to our truſt, for his uſe, more then our owne; and will require from us an account of our managing of it, and our parting from it.

What a wrong were it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the great Lord and giver of life, to ſteale out of the world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his leave that placed us there? But much more if Chriſtians, they know themſelves, beſides, dearly paid for; and therefore not in their own diſpoſing, but in his that bought
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53799:88"/>
them. Secondly, moſt deſperately injurious to our ſelves, as incurring thereby a certaine damnation (for ought appears to lookers on) for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, of thoſe ſoules which have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully broken Gods more eaſie, and temporary priſon, to put themſelves upon the direfull priſon of Satan to all eternity.</p>
               <p>Nature it ſelfe, though not enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened with the knowledge of the eſtate of another world, found cauſe to abhor this practice: However the Stoicall Philoſophers, and ſome high Roman ſpirits following their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, have been liberall of their lives; the <hi>Thebans</hi> of old profeſſed deteſtation of this worſt of prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: And the <hi>Athenians</hi> enacted that the hand which ſhould be guilty of ſuch an act, ſhould be cut off, and kept unburied; And it was wiſely ordained by that Grecian Common-wealth, when their Virgins (out of a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53799:88"/>
peeviſh diſcontentment) were grown into a ſelfe-killing humour, that the bodies of ſuch offenders ſhould be dragged naked through the ſtreets of the city; the ſhame whereof ſtopped the courſe of that mad reſolution.</p>
               <p>It is not the heavieſt of croſſes, or the ſharpeſt bodily anguiſh that can warrant ſo foule an act. Well was it turned off by <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> of old, when in the extremity of his paine he cried out; Oh who will free me from this torment! and <hi>Diogenes</hi> reach't him a poynard, wherewith to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch himſelfe: Nay, ſaid he, I ſaid, from my torment, not from my life: as well knowing it neither ſafe, nor eaſie, to part with our ſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch termes.</p>
               <p>Farre, farre be it from us to put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ranke and file thoſe worthy Martyrs, which in the fervor of their holy zeale have put themſelves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to martyrdome; and have cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageouſly

For theſe (whom we may well match with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and <hi>Eleazar)</hi> what Gods ſpirit wrought in them, he knowes that gave it; Rules are they by which we live, not examples.</p>

And unto this head muſt be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thoſe infinite examples of deadly ſufferings for good cauſes, willingly embraced for conſcience ſake.

               <p>And every right-diſpoſed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an will rather welcome death then yeeld to a willing act of Idolatry, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, witchcraft: If hereupon death follow by the infliction of others, they are ſinfull agents, he is an innocent ſufferer.</p>
               <p>As for that ſcruple among our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſts, whether a man condemned to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53799:92"/>
dye by poyſon, may take the deadly draught that is brought him; it is ſuch, as wiſe <hi>Socrates</hi> never made of old, when the <hi>Athenians</hi> tendred him his hemlock; and indeed it may as well be diſputed, whether a man condemned to dye by the axe, may quietly lay downe his head upon the block; and not, but upon force, yeeld to that fatall ſtroke. A juſter ſcruple is, whether a man condemned to a certaine and painfull death, which he cannot poſſibly eſchew, may make choice rather of a more eaſie paſſage out of the world; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I marvell at the indulgence of ſome Doctors that would either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, or mince the matter. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I cannot blame that naturall diſpoſition in any creature, to ſhrinke from paine, and to affect (what it may) the ſhifting from extremity of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: yet for a Chriſtian ſo to doe it, as to draw a greater miſchief to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53799:92"/>
and an apparent danger to his ſoule, it cannot juſtly beare any other then a hard conſtruction.

               <p>But if in that way, wherein the doome of death is paſſed, a man can give himſelf eaſe, or ſpeed of diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as when a Martyr being adjudg'd to the fire, uſes the help of a bag of Gun-powder, to expedite his paſſage) it cannot bee any way judged unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: The ſentence is obeyed, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution is accordingly done; and, if the patient have found a ſhorter way to that end which is appointed him, what offence can this be either to the law, or to the Judge?</p>

Doubtleſſe to hold any faire termes of commerce, or peace (much more of amitie or familiarity) with them, were no better then to profeſſe our ſelves enemies to God; for ſuch an irreconcileable hoſtility there is betwixt the holy God, and theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant ſpirits, that there can be no place for a neutrality in our relation to them: ſo as he is an abſolute ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the one, that bids not open defiance to the other.</p>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53799:107"/>
the guilt of his ſin to my own wrong: ſurely it argues but ſmall appetite to theſe heavenly viandes, if you can be put off with a pretence of others faults: Judge of the ſpirituall repaſt by this earthly; were you throughly hungry, would you refraine from your meat becauſe one of the gueſts hath a paire of foule hands? that may be a juſt eye-ſore to you, but no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why you ſhould forbeare whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome diſhes: Carve you for your felfe, and looke to your owne tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher; he feeds for himſefe, not for you; ſin is the uncleanneſſe of the ſoule; that cleaves cloſer to it, then any outward naſtineſſe can to the skin; to feed thus foule then is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe unwholſome, to himſelfe, it can be no hurt to you.

ſafe to ſit at the Table with him? now ſin is of a peſtilent nature, ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its infection to others beſides its owne ſubject; therefore it is meet we keep aloofe from the danger of his contagion: True, there are ſinnes of a contagious nature, apt to diffuſe their venome to others, (as there are otherſome whoſe evill is intrinſe call to the owner) but theſe infect by way of evill counſails, or examples, or familiar converſation, not by way of a meere extemporary preſence of the perſon, by ſpreading of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to thoſe that are taken with them; not by ſcattering abroad any guilt to thoſe that abhorre them.

                  <p>Whether Vowes be not out of ſeaſon now under the Goſpell; of what things they may be made; how farre they oblige us; and whether and how far they may be capable of releaſe.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is a wrongfull imputation that is caſt upon us by the Roman Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, that we abandone all vowes under the Goſpell: They well ſee that we allow and profeſſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vow (as <hi>Leſsius</hi> termes it) in Baptiſme; which yet both <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> and he, with other of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts, deny to be properly ſuch: It is true, that as infants make it by their
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53799:109"/>
proxies, there may ſeeme ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of the ingagement as to their perſons; but if the party Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened be of mature age, the expreſſe vow is made abſolutely by, and for himſelfe. Beſides this we allow of the renovation of all thoſe holy vowes, (relating to the firſt) which may binde us to a more ſtrict obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to our God; yet more, though we doe not now allow the vowes of things in their nature indifferent, to be parts of Gods worſhip, (as they were formerly under the law) yet we doe willingly approve of them, as good helps and furtherances to us, for the avoiding of ſuch ſinnes as we are obnoxious unto; and for the better forwarding of our holy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>Thus, the charge is of eternall uſe, Pſal. 76. 11. <hi>Vow unto God and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it:</hi> Not that we are bound to vow; that act is free and voluntary:
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53799:110"/>
but that when we have vowed, we are ſtraightly bound to performance: It is with us for our vowes as it was with <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> for their ſubſtance, Whiles it remained (ſaith S. <hi>Peter)</hi> was it not thine own? <hi>(Act.</hi> 5. 4.) He needed not to ſell it, he needed not to give it; but if he will give, he may not reſerve: If he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to give all, it is death to ſave ſome; he lyes to the holy Ghoſt, that defalkes from that which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelfe to beſtow.</p>
               <p>It mainly concernes us therefore to looke carefully in the firſt place, to what we vow; and to our intentions in vowing; and to ſee that our vow be not raſh and unadviſed; of things either triviall, or unlawfull, or impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, or out of our power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme; for every vow is a promiſe made to God; and to promiſe unto that great and holy God, that which either we cannot, or ought not to doe,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53799:110"/>
what is it other then to mock and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe that Sacred Majeſty; which will not hold him guiltleſſe that taketh his name in vaine? It is the charge to this purpoſe of wiſe <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; Be not raſh with thy mouth; and let not thine heart be haſty to utter any thing before God; for God is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and thou upon earth, therefore let thy words be few.</hi> Eccleſ. 5. 2.</p>
               <p>Your vow therefore muſt be either of things morally good; for the quickening you in that duty which you are bound to doe: or of things indifferent in themſelves, the refrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or doing whereof may tend ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the reſtraint from ſin, or the furtherance of your holy obedience: As a man that finds his brains weake, and his inclination too ſtrong to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing liquor, bindes himſelfe by a vow to drinke no wine ſave onely at Gods table: or a man that findes himſelfe apt to be miſ-carried by his appetite,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53799:111"/>
confines himſelfe by his vow to one diſh; or to one meale for the day: or a man that finds himſelfe given to the pleaſure of gaming, to the loſſe of his time, and the weakning of his eſtate, curbes himſelfe by his vow never to play for money: or a man that findes his prayers weake, and his fleſh rebellious, vowes to tame his unruly deſires, and to ſtir up his dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler devotions, by faſting.</p>
               <p>And as the matter of your vow muſt be carefully regarded; ſo alſo your intentions in vowing; for if you vow to doe good to an ill end, your thanke is loſt, and danger of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment incurred: as if you vow to give almes for vaine glory, or oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: or, if God ſhall proſper your uſurious, or monopolizing project, you will build an hoſpitall; your vow is like to be ſo accepted, as the ſtory tells us, the prayers were, of that bold <hi>Curtizan,</hi> who comming to the ſhrine
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53799:111"/>
of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <note n="*" place="bottom">Bromiard. ſum. praedict.</note> 
                  <hi>Canterbury</hi> (as that traitour was ſtiled) devoutly begd, that through the interceſſion of that Saint, ſhe might be graced with ſo winning a beauty, that might allure her paramours, to a gainfull courting of ſo pleaſing a miſtreſſe; when ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly (as my author tells me) ſhe was ſtricken blinde: and certainly, ſo it might well be; for if a ſuppoſed Saint were invoked, it was God that was highly provoked by the ſinfull peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſhameleſſe harlot: and it was moſt juſt for him to revenge it; and ſo we may well expect it ſhall be with whoſoever ſhall dare to make uſe of his ſacred name to their owne wicked or unwarrantable purpoſes.</p>
               <p>Since therefore our vowes muſt be for their matter (as Caſuiſts well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine) <hi>De meliore bono,</hi> and for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, holy and directed onely to good; it plainly appeares that many
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53799:112"/>
idle purpoſes, promiſes, reſolutions are wont to paſſe with men for vows, which have no juſt claime to that holy title: One ſaies he vowes never to be friends with ſuch a one that hath highly abuſed him; another, that he will never come under the roofe of ſuch an unkinde neighbour: one that he will drinke ſo many healths to his honoured friend; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he will not give the wall or the way to any paſſenger: one that he will never weare ſuit but of ſuch a colour; another that he will never cut his haire till ſuch an event; Theſe, and ſuch like may be fooliſh, unjuſt, ridiculous ſelfe-ingagements; but vowes they are not; neither there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe binde the conſcience other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then as <hi>Sampſons</hi> cords, and withes, which he may breake as a thred of towe. <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. 9. 12.</p>
               <p>But as for true vowes; certainly they are ſo binding, that you ſhall ſin
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53799:112"/>
hainouſly in not performing them: It is no better then diſhoneſty to faile in what we have promiſed to men; but to diſappoint God in our vowes, is no leſſe then ſacriledge: That of <hi>Solomons</hi> is weighty; Eccleſ. 5. 4, 5, 6. <hi>When thou voweſt a vow unto God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre not to pay it, for he hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in fooles; pay that which thou haſt vowed: Better it is that thou ſhouldſt not vow; then that thou ſhouldſt vow and not pay it: Suffer not thy mouth to cauſe thy fleſh to ſin; neither ſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Angel that it was an errour; wherefore ſhould God be angry at thy vows and deſtroy the work of thine hands?</hi> If therefore a lawfull and juſt vow have paſſed your lips, you may not be falſe to God, and your ſelfe in not keeping it.</p>

               <p>THere is no one point wherein the Church of God hath ſuffered more then in the miſ-underſtanding of this queſtion; How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand innocents have in theſe latter

And even amongſt our ſelves, how apt we are to brand one another with this hatefull marke where there is no true merit of ſuch a reproach?</p>
               <p>It much imports us therefore to know who may be deſervedly thus ſtigmatized by us: I have elſewhere ſomewhat largely inſiſted on this theme; whither I might ſpare ſome lines to referre you; But, in ſhort, thus: To let paſſe the originall ſenſe, and divers acceptions of the word; An hereſie is no other then an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate errour againſt the foundation; All truthes are precious, but ſome withall neceſſary; All errours are
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53799:115"/>
faulty, but ſome damnable; the hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſſe of the error is according to the worth of the truth impugned; There are Theologicall verities fit for us to know and beleeve; there are Articles of Chriſtian faith need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be known and beleeved; There are truths of meet and decent ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure, without which the fabrick may ſtand; there are truths of the foundation ſo eſſentiall, as that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them it cannot ſtand: It is a maime to the houſe if but a tile be pull'd off from the roofe, but if the foundation be razed, the building is overthrown: this is the endevour and act of hereſie.</p>
               <p>But now the next queſtion will be, what doctrines they are which muſt be accounted to be of the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Our countreyman <hi>Fiſher</hi> the Jeſuite, and his Aſſociates will tell you roundly, that all thoſe things which are defined by the Church to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53799:116"/>
are <note n="*" place="bottom">Relat. of the third confer. p. 6.</note> fundamentall: A large groundworke of faith: Doubtleſſe the Church hath defined all things contained in the ſcripture, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved; and theirs (which they call Catholick) hath defined all thoſe Traditionall points which they have added to the Creed, upon the ſame neceſſity of ſalvation to be beleeved; now if all theſe be the foundation, which is the building? what an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect fabrick doe they make of Chriſtian Religion; all foundation, no walls, no roofe? Surely it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, without too much abſurdity, be denied, that there is great difference of Truthes, ſome more important then others; which could not be, if all were alike fundamentall: If there were not ſome ſpeciall Truthes, the beleefe whereof makes, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth a Chriſtian, the authors of the Creed Apoſtolick (beſides the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53799:116"/>

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53799:117"/>
ready to relent upon better light, he may not be thus branded: evicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and contumacy muſt improve his error to be hereticall. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> therefore hath beene too cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly-liberall of her cenſures this way; having beſtow'd this livery upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand Chriſtians whom God hath owned for his Saints: and upon ſome Churches more Orthodoxe then her ſelfe; preſuming upon a power (which was never granted her from heaven,) to ſtate new articles of faith; and to excommunicate and barre all that ſhall dare to gainſay her oracles: Whereas the great Doctor of the Gentiles hath told us from the ſpirit of God, that there is but <hi>one Lord, one faith, one baptiſme;</hi> (Epheſ. 4. 5.) and what faith is that? S. <hi>Jude</hi> tells us: <hi>Jude 3. The faith that was once delivered the Salnts;</hi> ſo that as well may they make more reiterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Baptiſme, and multipliclties
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53799:117"/>
of Lords, as more faiths then one: ſome explications there may be of that one faith, made by the Church, upon occaſion of new-ſprung errors, but ſuch, as muſt have their grounds from fore-written truths; and ſuch, as may not extend to the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them whom God hath left free: new articles of faith they may not be: nor bind further then God hath reach't them.</p>
               <p>Hereticks then they are and onely they, that pertinaciouſly raze the foundation of the Chriſtian faith; what now muſt be done with them? ſurely, firſt, if they cannot be reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, they muſt be avoided: It is the charge of the beloved diſciple to the elect Lady, 2 <hi>John v. 10.

yet higher; for writing to <hi>Titus</hi> the great Super-intendent of <hi>Crete,</hi> his charge is, <hi>Tit. 3. 10. A man that is an heretick, after the firſt and ſecond ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition reject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, when we compare the charge with the perſon, we cannot but finde that this rejection, is not a meer negative act, of refraining com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; but a poſitive act of cenſure, ſo as he who had power to admoniſh, had alſo power to reject in an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative, or judicatory way: He ſayes then, <hi>Devita,</hi> reject or avoid, not (as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> too truly, but bitterly ſcoffes the Romiſh practiſe) <hi>De vita tolle:</hi> This of killing the heretick, as it was out of the power of a ſpirituall ſuperviſor, ſo was it no leſſe farre from the thoughts of him that deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to come in the ſpirit of meekneſs: Fagots were never ordained by the Apoſtle for arguments to confute hereticks; this bloudy Logick and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53799:118"/>
Divinity was of a much later brood; and is for a <hi>Dominick,</hi> not a <hi>Paul</hi> to owne: for certainly faith is of the ſame nature with love, it cannot be compelled; perſwaſions may move it, not force: Theſe intellectuall ſinnes muſt look for remedies of their own kind; But if either they be (as it is often) accompanied with dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable blaſphemies, againſt God, whether in his eſſence, or attributes, or the three incomprehenſible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the all-glorious Deity, or the bleſſed mediator betwixt God and man Jeſus Chriſt, in either of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; Or elſe, ſhall be attended with the publique diſturbances and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous diſtempers of the Kingdome, or State wherein they are broached, the Apoſtles wiſh is but ſeaſonable, in both a ſpirituall and a bodily ſenſe; <hi>Gal. 5. 12.

                  <p>Whether the laws of men doe bind the conſcience; and how far we are tyed to their obedience.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BOth theſe extreames of opinion concerning this point muſt needs bring much miſchief upon Church and Kingdome: Thoſe that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely hold ſuch a power in humane laws make themſelves ſlaves to men:
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53799:119"/>
Thoſe that deny any binding power in them, run looſe into all licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: Know then that there is a vaſt difference betwixt theſe two; To bind the conſcience in any act; and to bind a man in conſcience to do or omit an act: Humane laws cannot do the firſt of them; the latter they may, and muſt doe: To bind the conſcience is to make it guilty of a ſin in doing an act fobidden, or omitting an act injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as in it ſelfe ſuch: or making that act in it ſelfe an acceptable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God which is commanded by men: Thus humane lawes cannot bind the conſcience: It is God only, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 21. who, as he is greater then the Conſcience, ſo hath power to bind or looſe it: <hi>Eſay</hi> 31. 22. It is he that is the onely Law-giver to the Conſcience: <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 12. Princes and Churches may make lawes for the outward man; but they can no more bind the heart, then they can
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53799:120"/>
make it; In vaine is that power which is not inabled with coertion; now what coertion can any humane power claime of the heart, which it can never attain to know? the ſpirit of man therefore is ſubject onely to the father of ſpirits, who onely ſees and ſearches the ſecrets of it, and can both convince, and puniſh it.</p>
               <p>Beſides, well did penitent <hi>David</hi> know what he ſaid, when he cry'd out: <hi>Againſt thee onely have I ſinned: Pſal.</hi> 51. he knew that ſin is a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the law; and that none but Gods law can make a fin: men may be concerned, and injured in our actions, but it is God who hath forbidden theſe wrongs to men, that is ſinned againſt, in our acts of injuſtice and uncharitableneſſe: and who only can inflict the ſpirituall (which is the higheſt) revenge upon offenders. The charge of the great Doctor of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to his <hi>Galatians,</hi> was,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53799:120"/>
                  <hi>Gal. 5. 1. Stand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free; and be not intangled againe in the yoak of bondage.</hi> What yoak of bon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dage was this but the law of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies? what liberty was this but a freedome from the bondage of that law? And certainly if thoſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which had God for their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, have ſo little power to bind the conſcience, as that the yoak of their bondage muſt be ſhaken off, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Chriſtian liberty; how much leſſe is it to be indured, that we ſhould be the ſervants of men, in being tyed up to ſin by their preſumptuous impoſitions?</p>
               <p>The lawes of men therefore doe not, ought not, cannot bind your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as of themſelves; but, if they be juſt, they bind you in conſcience to obedience: They are the words of the Apoſtle to his Romans; <hi>Rom. 13. 5. Wherefore ye muſt needs be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53799:121"/>
not onely for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake.</hi> However then their particular conſtitution in themſelves put no ſpeciall obligation upon us, under paine of ſin, and damnation; yet in a generall relation to that God, who hath commanded us to obey authority, their neglect or contempt involves us in a guilt of ſin: All power is of God; that which the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority therefore enjoynes you, God enjoynes you by it; the charge is mediately his; though paſſing through the hands of men.</p>
               <p>How little is this regarded, in theſe looſe times, by thoſe lawleſſe perſons, whoſe practiſes acknowledge no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verainty but titular, no obedience but arbitrary; to whom the ſtrongeſt lawes, are as weapons to the <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, who eſteemes Iron as ſtraw, and braſſe as rotten wood?</hi> Job 41. 27.</p>
               <p>Surely had they not firſt caſt off their obedience to him that is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53799:121"/>
then the higheſt, they could not without trembling heare that weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty charge of the great God of heaven, <hi>Rom. 13. 1. Let every ſoule be ſubject to the higher powers: For there is no power but of God; and the powers that be, are ordained of God:</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 13. <hi>Submit your ſelves to every ordinance of man for the Lords ſake;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould be convinced in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, of that awe, and duty, which they owe to Soveraignty, and know and reſolve to obey God in men; and men for God.</p>
               <p>You ſee then how requiſite it is, that you walke in a middle way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that exceſſive power which flattering Caſuiſts have beene wont to give to Popes, Emperours, Kings, and Princes in their ſeverall juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions; and a lawleſſe neglect of lawfull authority: For the orthodox, wiſe, and juſt moderation whereof, theſe laſt ages are much indebted to

               <p>But in the mean time, farre be it
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53799:122"/>
from us to draw this knot of our obligation harder, and cloſer then au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority it ſelfe intends it: What ever Popes may doe for their Decrees, certainly good Princes never meant to lay ſuch weight upon all their lawes as to make every breach of them (even in relation to the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty given them by God) to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>Their lawes are commonly ſhut up with a ſanction of the penalty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the violation: There is an <hi>obedientia burſalis,</hi> (as, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Gerſon,</hi> calls it,) an obedience, if not of the perſon, yet of the purſe; which Princes are content to take up withall: we have a world of ſinnes (God knowes) upon us in our hourely tranſgreſſions of the royall lawes of our maker; but woe were us, if we ſhould have ſo many ſinnes more, as we breake ſtatutes: In penall lawes, where ſcandall or contempt finde no
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53799:123"/>
place, humane authority is wont to reſt ſatisfied with the mulct paid, when the duty is not performed.</p>
               <p>Not that we may wilfully incurre the breach of a good law, becauſe our hands are upon our purſe-ſtrings ready to ſtake the forfeiture; This were utterly to fruſtrate the end of good lawes, which doe therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a mulct that they may not be broken; and were highly injurious to ſoveraigne authority, as if it ſought for our money, not our obedience, and cared more for gaine, then good order; then which there cannot be a more baſe imputation caſt upon go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: As then we are wont to ſay in relation of our actions to the lawes of God; that ſome things are forbidden becauſe they are ſinfull, and ſome things are ſinfull becauſe they are forbidden, ſo it holds alſo in the lawes of men; ſome things are forbidden becauſe they are juſtly
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53799:123"/>
offenſive; and ſome other things are onely therefore offenſive becauſe they are forbidden; in the former of theſe, we muſt yeeld our carefull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, out of reſpect even to the duty it ſelfe; in the latter, out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the will of the law-giver; yet ſo, as that if our own important occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſhall enforce us to tranſgreſſe a penall law, without any affront of authority or ſcandall to others, our ſubmiſſion to the penalty frees us from a ſinfull diſobedience.</p>

in this caſe, and not left to the meere arbitrary will of the givers, it too well appeares in common experience; which tells us how ordinary it is, where miniſters depend upon volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary benevolences, if they doe but upon ſome juſt reproofe gall the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of a guilty hearer; or preach ſome truth which diſ-reliſhes the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of a prepoſſeſſed auditor, how he ſtraight flies out; and not onely with-holds his owne pay, but alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes the contributions of others: ſo as the free-tongued teacher muſt either live by ayre, or be forced to change his paſture: It were eaſie to inſtance, but charity bids me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare.</p>
               <p>Hereupon it is, that theſe ſportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary preachers are faine to ſooth up their many maiſters, and are ſo gag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the fear of a ſtarving diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, that they dare not be free in the reprehenſion of the daring ſins of

               <p>WHat unjuſt and cruell meaſure hath been heretofore offered by the Spaniard to miſerable Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in this kind, I had rather you
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:53799:131"/>
ſhould receive from the relation of their own Biſhop, <hi>Bartolomaus Caſa,</hi> then from my Pen.</p>
               <p>He can tell you a ſad ſtory of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of thoſe poor ſavages made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, to make roome for thoſe their imperious ſucceſſours; the diſcovery of whoſe unjuſt uſurpation, procured but little thanks to their learned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of <hi>Complutum</hi> and <hi>Salamanca:</hi> Your queſtion relates to our owne caſe; ſince many thouſands of our nation have tranſplanted themſelves into thoſe regions, which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed by barbarous owners: As for thoſe countries which were not inhabited by any reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, (as the <hi>Bermudas,</hi> or Summer-Iſlands; which were onely peopled with hogges, and deer, and ſuch like brute cattle) there can be no reaſon why they ſhould not fall to the firſt occupant; but where the land hath a known maiſter the caſe muſt vary:
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53799:131"/>
For the deciſion whereof ſome grounds are fit to be laid.</p>
               <p>No nation under heaven but hath ſome Religion or other, and worſhips a God ſuch as it is, although a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture much inferiour in very nature to themſelves; although the worſt of creatures, evill ſpirits: and that religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein they were bred, (through an invincible ignorance of better) they eſteeme good at leaſt.</p>
               <p>Dominion and propriety is not founded in Religion, but in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and civill right; It is true that the Saints have in Chriſt, the Lord of all things, a ſpirituall right in all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; <hi>All things are yours,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods:</hi> but the ſpirituall right gives a man no title at all to any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall or civill poſſeſſion here on earth; yea Chriſt himſelf, though both as God, and as Mediator, the whole world were his, yet he tells
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:53799:132"/>
                  <hi>Pilate, My Kingdom is not of this world;</hi> neither did he (though the Lord Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of this whole earth) by vertue of that tranſcendent ſoveraignty put any man out of the poſſeſſion of one foot of ground which fell to him, either by birth, or purchaſe: Neither doth the want of that ſpirituall inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt bebarre any man from a rightfull claime and fruition of theſe earthly inheritances.</p>
               <p>The barbarous people were Lords of their owne; and have their Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores; and orders, and formes of government under which they peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably live without the intermedling with other nations.</p>
               <p>Infidelity cannot forfeit their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance to others; no more then enmity profeſſed by Jewes to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, can eſcheat their goods to the Crownes under which they live; yea much leſſe: for thoſe Jewes, living amongſt Chriſtian
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:53799:132"/>
people, have, or might have had meanes ſufficient to reclaime them from their ſtubborne unbeliefe, but theſe ſavages have never had the leaſt overture of any ſaving helps towards their converſion: They therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as true owners of their native in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances, as Chriſtians are of theirs, they can no more be forced from their poſſeſſions by Chriſtians, then Chriſtians may be ſo forced by them: Certainly, in the ſame tearms wherein they ſtand to Chriſtians, do alſo in their judgement, Chriſtians ſtand to them; and if it would ſeeme hard to us, that an inundation of Pagans ſhould (as heretofore it hath done) break in upon us, and drive us out of our native poſſeſſions, how could it ſeeme leſſe unjuſt in us to them?</p>
               <p>Their Idolatries, and ſins againſt nature are haynous and abominable; and ſuch as for which God of old
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53799:133"/>
condemned the ſeven nations to an utter extirpation; But what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion have we for their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Could we ſhow ſuch a patent in this caſe as the Iſraelites had for their warres againſt <hi>Amalek,</hi> and thoſe neighbouring heathens, all were ſure: But you know who ſaid, <hi>What have I to doe to judge them that are without?</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 12. And if he may not be a Judge, who may be an executioner?</p>
               <p>Refuſall of Chriſtianity can be no ſufficient ground of either invaſion, or expulſion: ſith violence is not the appointed way for plantation of the faith: which muſt be perſwaded, and not compelled; that ſentence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Pope <note n="*" place="bottom">

juſt motives, and rules of proceedings herein, as might be, in ſuch a caſe, juſtifiable: to which grave and ſolid diſcourſe of his, you may, if you pleaſe, be referred for further ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>Onwards, I ſhall draw forth ſome few of ſuch conſiderations from him as may ſerve for my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore it is lawfull for Chriſtians to travell into any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try under heaven; and as ſtrangers to ſtay there, without any wrong done to the natives; A thing allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the law of nations derived from the law nature; By which law it is every where held an inhumane thing to offer ill meaſure to a ſtranger. It is the argument that righteous <hi>Lot</hi> uſed to the worſt of Pagans, the <hi>Sodomites; Onely unto theſe men doe nothing; for therefore are they come under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of my roof,</hi> Gen. 19. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:53799:135"/>
And if before the diviſion of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the earth lay freely open to all paſſengers without ſcruple, to travell whither they pleaſed, ſurely, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition was never intended to warrant a reſtraint: And if nature have made the Sea and all the In-lets of it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, it were very injurious to abridge any nation of the free uſe of ſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall an element.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is lawfull for us to uſe trafique with thoſe Infidels, and to interchange commodities with them, and to abide upon their coaſts for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation; and to fiſh in their ſea, and to take part of thoſe profits which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath made common to all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers: And if thoſe Pagans ſhall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us in ſo warrantable courſes, it will be meet for us to tender them all faire ſatisfaction; perſwading them that we intend no harme or prejudice to them in their perſons, or eſtate; but much good to both; labouring
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:53799:136"/>
to win them by all courteous demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure; But if they ſhall fly out, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all our kind indevours, into a violent oppoſition of us; ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon us in a hoſtile manner, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to cut our throats in ſo unjuſt a quarrell, it is lawfull for us to ſtand upon our defence, and to repell one force with another; and to uſe all convenient meanes for our ſecurity; and if we cannot otherwiſe be ſafe, to raiſe bulwarks or fortifications for our own indemnity; and if we finde our ſelves over-powred by impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Savages, to call for the aid and aſſiſtance of our friends, and (if the enmity continue and proceed) of our Princes: ſince the juſt cauſe of warre is the propulſation of publique inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and ſuch injury is as great, as barbarous.</p>
               <p>But if not ſo much cruelty of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition as feare and ſuſpition of a ſtrange nation ſhal arme them againſt
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53799:136"/>
us; our care muſt be ſo to manage our own defence, as may be leaſt offenſive to them; and therefore we may not take this occaſion of killing their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or ſacking their townes, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populating their countries; for that in this caſe they are no other then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
               <p>If after all gentle intreaties, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous uſages, and harmleſſe ſelfe-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, they ſhall perſiſt in a malicious hoſtility, and can by no means be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed from their impetuous on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets; there is now juſt cauſe not to deale with them as innocents, but as enemies: and therefore to proceed againſt them accordingly.</p>
               <p>But an higher and more warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able title, that we may have to deale with theſe barbarous Infidels, is, for the propagation of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the promulgation of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt amongſt theſe miſerable ſavages: For which we
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53799:137"/>
have good ground from the charge of our Saviour: <hi>Goe preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to every creature; Mar. ult.</hi> and he that was in bonds for the name of the Lord Jeſus, tels us, <hi>the word of God is not bound;</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 9. not bound, either in fetters, or within li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits: Oh that we could approve to God, and our conſciences, that this is our maine motive and principall drift in our weſterne plantations; but how little appearance there is of this holy care and indevour, the plaine dealer upon knowledge hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently informed us; Although I now heare of one induſtrious ſpirit that hath both learned the language of our new-Iſlanders, and printed ſome part of the ſcripture in it; and train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up ſome of their children in the principles of Chriſtianity: a ſervice highly acceptable to God, and no leſſe meritorious of men: The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell then may be, muſt be preached
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:53799:137"/>
to thoſe heathens, (otherwiſe they ſhall perpetually remaine out of the eſtate of ſalvation) and all poſſible meanes muſt be uſed for their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; But herein I muſt have leave to depart from <hi>Victoria,</hi> that he holds it lawfull if the ſavages doe not freely permit (but goe about to hinder) the preaching of the Goſpell, to raiſe warre againſt them; as if he would have them cudgelled into Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: ſurely this is not the way: It is for Mahumetans to profeſſe plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting religion by the ſword; it is not for Chriſtians; It is a juſt clauſe therefore, that he puts in, that the ſlaughters hereupon raiſed may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prove an hinderance to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the ſavages, as indeed it fell out; the poore Indians being by theſe bloody courſes brought into ſuch a deteſtation of their maſters, the Caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, that they profeſt they would not goe to heaven if any Spaniards were there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:53799:138"/>

               <p>At whoſe girdle the keyes of the kingdome of heaven doe hang, me thinkes we ſhould not need diſpute, when we hear our Saviour ſo expreſly deliver them to <hi>Peter,</hi> in the name of the reſt of his fellowes; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to all his Apoſtles, and their lawfull ſucceſſors in the diſpenſation of the doctrine and diſcipline of his Church: In the diſpenſation of doctrine to all his faithfull Miniſters under the Goſpell; In the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diſcipline to thoſe that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the mannaging of Church-government; with theſe latter we meddle not; neither need we, if we had occaſion; after the ſo learned and elaborate diſcourſe of the power of the Keyes, ſet forth by judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Doctor <hi>Hammond;</hi> to which I ſuppoſe nothing can be added. The
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53799:139"/>
former is that which lies before us: Doubtleſſe, every true miniſter of Chriſt, hath by vertue of his firſt and everlaſting commiſſion, two keyes delivered in his hand; they key of knowledge, and the key of ſpirituall power: the one, whereby he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to enter and ſearch into, not only the revealed myſteries of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alſo, in ſome ſort, into the heart of the penitent; there diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (upon an ingenuous revelation of the offender) both the nature, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and degree of the ſinne; and the truth, validity, and meaſure of his repentance: The other whereby he may in ſome ſort either lock up the ſoul under ſinne, or free it from ſin: theſe keyes were never given him, but with an intention that he ſhould make uſe of them upon juſt occaſion. The uſe that he may and muſt make of them, is both generall, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall: Generall; in publiſhing the

will and pleaſure of God ſignified in his Word, concerning ſinners; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing forgiveneſſe of ſinnes to the humble penitent, and denouncing judgement to the unbeleeving, and obdured ſinner: In which regard, he is as the Herald of the Almighty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming war and juſt indignation to the obſtinate; and tendring tearmes of pardon and peace to the relenting and contrite ſoul: or rather, as the Apoſtle ſtiles him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20.

               <p>Speciall, in a particular applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this knowledge and power to the ſoul of that ſinner which makes his addreſſe unto him: Wherein muſt be inquired both what neceſſity there is of this recourſe, and what aide and comfort it may bring unto the ſoul.</p>

Two caſes there are wherein cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is a neceſſity of applying our ſelves to the judgement of our ſpirituall guides; The firſt is in our doubt of the nature and quality of the fact; whether it be a ſinne, or no ſinne; for both many ſinnes are ſo guilded over with faire pretences and colourable circumſtances, that they are not to be deſcryed but by judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eyes; and ſome actions which are of themſelves indifferent may by a ſcrupulous conſcience be miſtaken for hainous offences: whither ſhould we goe in theſe doubts but to our Counſaile learned in the Lawes of God; of whom God himſelfe hath ſaid by his Prophet, <hi>The Prieſts lips ſhould keep knowledge; and they ſhould ſeek the law at his mouth; for he is the meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Mal. 2. 7.</p>

The ſoul of the remorſed draweth near to the grave; and his life to the deſtroyers:</hi> ver. 23. <hi>But if there be a meſſenger</hi> (of God) <hi>with him, an interpreter, one of a thouſand, to ſhew unto man his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe,</hi> (and the ſoundneſſe of his repentance) ver. 24. <hi>then is</hi> (God) <hi>gratious unto him, and ſaith, Deliver him from going down into the pit; I have found a ranſome, &amp;c.</hi> ver. 26. <hi>He ſhall pray unto God; and he will be favourable unto him; and he ſhall ſee his face with joy.</hi> In caſe of ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſickneſſe of the body we truſt not our own skill, nor ſome ignorant quack ſalvers, but ſeek to a learned

and experienced Phyſitian for the preſcription of ſome ſure remedies; whereas, if it be but for a ſore finger, or a tooth-ach, we care onely to make uſe of our own receits: And ſo in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil quarrels; if it be only ſome ſleight brabble, we thinke to compoſe it alone; but if it be ſome maine queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on importing our freehold, we are glad to waite on the ſtaires of ſome judicious Lawyer, and to fee him for advice: How much more is it thus in the perilous condition of our ſoules; which as it is a part farre more precious then its earthly Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, ſo the diſeaſes whereto it is ſubject, are infinitely more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and deadly.</p>
               <p>Is your heart therefore embroyled within you, with the guilt of ſome hainous ſin? labour what you may to make your peace with heaven; humble your ſelfe unto the duſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Majeſty whom you have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53799:142"/>
beat your guilty breſt, water your cheeks with your teares; and cry mightily to the father of mercies for a gracions remiſſion; but if after all theſe penitent indevours you finde your ſoule ſtill unquiet, and not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently apprehenſive of a free and full forgiveneſſe, betake your ſelfe to Gods faithfull Agent for peace; run to your ghoſtly Phyſitian, lay your boſome open before him; flatter not your owne condition; let neither feare nor ſhame ſtay his hand from probing and ſearching the wound to the bottome; and that being done, make carefull uſe of ſuch ſpirituall applications as ſhall be by him admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to you: This, this is the way to a perfect recovery, and fulneſſe of comfort.</p>
               <p>But you eaſily grant that there may be very wholſome uſe of the ghoſtly counſell of your Miniſter in the caſe of a troubled ſoule; but you
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53799:142"/>
doubt of the validity and power of his abſolution: concerning which it was a juſt queſtion of the Scribes in the Goſpell; <hi>Who can forgive ſinnes but God onely?</hi> Mar. 2. 6. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our therefore to prove that he had this power, argues it from his divine omnipotence; <hi>He onely hath authority to forgive ſinnes,</hi> (ver. 7.) that can ſay to the decrepit paralytick; <hi>Ariſe, take up thy bed and walke;</hi> (ver. 9.) none but a God can by his command effect this; he is therefore the true God that may abſolutely ſay, <hi>Thy ſinnes be forgiven thee:</hi> (ver. 10.) In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, how can it be otherwiſe? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God onely is our ſin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; againſt man onely in the relation that man hath to God; He onely can know the depth of the malignity of ſin, who onely knowes the ſoule wherein it is forged; He onely who is Lord of the ſoule, the God of ſpirits, can puniſh the ſoule for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53799:143"/>
He onely that is infinite can doome the ſinfull ſoule to infinite torments; He onely therefore it muſt be, that can releaſe the guilty ſoule from ſin, and puniſhment. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore man, or Angell ſhall challenge to himſelfe this abſolute power to forgive ſinne let him be accurſed.</p>
               <p>Yet withall it muſt be yeelded, that the bleſſed Son of God ſpake not thoſe words of his laſt commiſſion in vaine; <hi>Whoſe ſoever ſinnes ye remit, they are remitted unto them, and whoſe ſoever ſinnes ye retaine, they are retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> John 20. 23. neither were they ſpoken to the then preſent Apoſtles onely, but in them to all their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſucceſſors to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>It cannot therefore but be granted, that there is ſome kind of power left in the hand of Chriſts miniſters, both to remit and retaine ſinne: Neither is this power given onely to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53799:143"/>
of the Church, in reſpect of the cenſures to be inflicted, or relaxed by them; but to all Gods faithfull miniſters, in relation to the ſins of men: A power not ſoveraigne and abſolute, but limitted and miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, for either quieting the conſcience of the penitent, or further aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the conſcience of ſin and terror of judgement to the obſtinate and rebellious; Neither is this onely by way of a bare verball declaration, (which might proceed from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lips) but in the way of an opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and effectuall application, by vertue of that delegate, or commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary authority, which is by Chriſt entruſted with them: For certainly, our Saviour meant in theſe words to conferre ſomewhat upon his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, more then the reſt of the world ſhould be capable to receive, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, The abſolution therefore of an authorized perſon muſt needs be
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53799:144"/>
of greater force and efficacy, then of any private man, how learned or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoever, ſince it is grounded upon the inſtitution and commiſſion of the Sonne of God, from which all power and vertue is derived to all his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: and we may well ſay, that whatſoever is in this caſe, done by Gods miniſter (the Key not erring) is ratified in heaven: It cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but be a great comfort, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall aſſurance to the penitent ſoule, to heare the meſſenger of God (after a carefull inquiſition into his ſpiritual eſtate and true ſight of his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) in the name of the Lord Jeſus pronouncing to him the full remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all his ſinnes.</p>
               <p>And if either the bleſſing, or curſe of a father goe deeper with us, then of any other whoſoever; although but proceeding from his own private affection without any warrant from above; how forcible ſhall we eſteeme

the Goſpell, which was perhaps in your intention; this is farre more large then the other; every man that preacheth, interpreteth the Scripture; but every one that interprets Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, doth not preach: To inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret Scripture is onely to give the ſenſe of a Text; but to preach is to divide the Word aright; to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to the conſcience of the hearer; and in an authoritative way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſinne, and denounce judgment againſt ſinners; to lay forth the ſweet promiſes of the Goſpell to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and penitent; for the performing whereof there muſt be a commiſſion to Gods miniſter from him that ſends him; upon which the Apoſtle hath pronounced a (<gap reason="foreign">

receiver; yet it hath, as they hold, ſuch a ſecret influence upon the ſoule, as that it leaves a perpetuall bond behind it, never to be diſſolved till death; So as thoſe offenders, which by juſt cenſure are ſeparated from the board and the bed, cannot yet be freed from the bond of marriage: upon this ground it is that they barre the innocent party from the benefit of a ſecond marriage, as ſuppoſing the obligation of the former, ſtill in force. In the ordinary Bills of the Jewiſh divorce, the repudiated wife had full ſcope given her of a ſecond choice; as the words ran: <note n="*" place="bottom">Maimon. Treat. of Divorce.</note> 
                  <hi>She was to be free, and to have power over her owne ſoule; to goe away; to be married to any man whom ſhe would:</hi> They were not more liberall, then our Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh divorcers are niggardly: The Jewiſh divorce being upon unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable cauſe, made their liberality
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:53799:169"/>
ſo much more finfull, as their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce was more unjuſt: for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced woman was ſtill in right the lawfull wife of that unrighteous huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band that diſmiſſed her; the Romiſh doctrine makes their ſtrait-handed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſo much more injurious, as the cauſe of ſeparation is more juſt.</p>
               <p>Even this queſtion alſo is expreſly determined by our Saviour in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Phariſee: <hi>Whoſoever ſhall put away his wife except it be for fornication, and marrieth another, committeth adultery:</hi> Mat. 19. Lo then, he that for ſo juſt a cauſe as fornication putteth away his wife and marrieth another, committeth not adultery: the exception mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly implies ſo much, both in reaſon and common uſe: neither indeed, are the words capable of any other probable ſenſe: That which <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> would faſten upon it, referring the exception to the former clauſe, of
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:53799:170"/>
diſmiſſion onely, ſo as it might be lawfull to divorce onely for fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not to marry after divorce; cannot ſtand without a ſupply of words of his owne, which God never allow'd him to interſert; and beſides utterly deſtroies the ſenſe; caſting ſuch a doctrine upon our Saviour, as he would hate to owne; for except that reſtraint be referred to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying againe, the ſenſe would run thus, <hi>whoſoever puts away his wife commits adultery;</hi> which ſtands not with truth or reaſon: ſith it is not the diſmiſſion, that is adulterous, but the marriage of another: It is therefore the plaine drift of our Saviour, to teach the Phariſee, that the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of a ſecond wife (after diſmiſſion of a former, upon any other cauſe except for fornication) is no leſſe then adultery: thereby enforcing, that upon a juſt diſmiſſion for fornication, a ſecond marriage cannot be branded with adultery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:53799:170"/>
Neither will it ſerve his turne, which he would borrow from S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> that upon this negative of our Saviours, we may not look to build an affirmative of our own; for though it be granted, that he, who putting away his wife not for fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and marrieth another, ſinneth; yet it followes not that he who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſmiſſed his wife for fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, marrieth another, ſinneth not at all: A ſinne it may be, though not an adultery: For ſurely if it be a ſinne, it muſt be againſt a commandement; and if againſt any commandement, it muſt be againſt the ſeventh; and what is the ſeventh commandement, but <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery?</hi> Beſides, the Phariſees queſtion <hi>[Is it lawfull for a man to put away his wife for every cauſe?]</hi> was not without a plaine implication of liberty to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry another; which our Saviour well knowing, gives a full anſwer as well
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:53799:171"/>
to what he meant, as what he ſaid; which had not been perfectly ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, if he had onely determined that one part concerning diſmiſſion, and not the other concerning marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; which clauſe if two other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts expreſſe not, yet it muſt be fetcht neceſſarily, from the third; ſince it is a ſure and irrefragable rule; <hi>That all four Evangeliſts make up one perfect Goſpell.</hi> It is therefore a very tottering and unſure ground which our Rhemiſts build upon; as if the Apoſtle meant to croſſe his Lord, and maſter, when he ſaith, <hi>The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband, ſo long as he liveth, Rom.</hi> 7. 2. therefore only death can diſſolve the bond of marriage; not divorce, not adultery, not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce for adultery: For how plainly doe the words carry their anſwer in themſelves: <note n="*" place="bottom">So alſo 1 Cor. 7. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>The woman</hi> (ſaith the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:53799:171"/>
Apoſtle) <hi>that hath an husband:</hi> but the woman legally divorced for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, hath no husband: S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of a true wife, not a divorced harlot: He had no occaſion here to look aſide at matter of divorce, but takes marriage as in its entire right; rather deſiring to urge (for clearing the caſe of our obligation to the law) that the husband being once dead, the wife is free to marry againe, then to intimate the caſe of her incapacity to marry till he be dead.</p>
               <p>As for that bond therefore, which is ſo much ſtood upon, if it be taken without all relations to the duties of bed, and board; it is meerly Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall; nothing but fantaſie. There are, or ſhould be Bonds of affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Bonds of mutuall reſpects, and reciprocall duties betwixt man and wife; and theſe muſt hold firme not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any locall ſeparation; neither time, nor place may ſo much
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:53799:172"/>
as flacken, much leſſe looſe them: but, where a juſt divorce intervenes, theſe bonds are chopt in peeces, and no more are, then if they had never been: And if all relations ceaſe in death, (as they doe, in whatſoever kind) ſurely divorce, being (as it is) no other then a legall death, doth ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly cut off (as the Hebrew terme im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports) all former obligations and reſpects betwixt the parties ſo finally ſeparated.</p>
               <p>The adulterous wife therefore duly divorced being thus dead in law as to her husband, the husband ſtands now as free as if he had never married: ſo as I know not why the Apoſtle ſhould not as well ſpeak to him as to any other; when he ſaith: <hi>Nevertheleſſe to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 2. Neither is it otherwiſe in the caſe of a chaſte wife after her ſeparation from an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous husband, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 12. In
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:53799:172"/>
theſe rights God makes no difference of ſexes; both may lawfully claime the ſame immunities: which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſhould they be denied to either, muſt needs draw on very great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences: For in how hard a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould the innocent party be hereupon left? Either the husband, or wife muſt be forced to live with an adulterous conſort; or be tyed to a perperuall neceſſity of either doing that (which perhaps they cannot doe) containing; or of ſuffering that which they ought not to indure, burning.</p>
               <p>What remedy now can be expected of ſo great a miſchiefe? Our Romiſh Doctors propoſe two; Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Continence: Both good, where they may be had; Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in caſe of a ſeaſonable and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe repentance; That which is the Apoſtles charge in caſe of deſertion, holds here alſo, [<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Continence, after ſuch ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in caſe of ability ſo gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for ſurely this holy diſpoſition is a gift; and therefore is not had, where it is not beſtowed; thoſe that place it in our power, derogate from the thanks of the giver: yea, he that gives it tells us <hi>all cannot receive it: Mar.</hi> 19. 11. he muſt not only give it, but give us power to take it.</p>
               <p>But where the offending party is obſtinately vicious; and the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent (after all indeavours) unable to containe, without a ſupply of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the caſe is remedileſſe; and we know Gods mercy ſuch, as that he leaves no man for matter of reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on utterly perplexed.</p>

in all reaſon were very unlawfull, and abſurd; ſince in all thoſe deſcending degrees there is a kinde of reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall inequality betwixt the lower and ſuperiour, which abhorres from all proportion of a match; whereas the collaterall equidiſtance of couſens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>german from the ſtock whence both deſcend, hath in it no ſuch appearance of inequality. Certainly then, no analogy can draw theſe marriages within the prohibition; whether the neareneſſe of approach to our fleſh be a juſt barre unto them, muſt be further conſidered.</p>

As there was no Chriſtian Church which did not carefully obſerve this ſacred Rite: ſo above all other the Roman hath been at leaſt curious enough in calling for a ſtrict and ſevere account of their eſpouſalls: what voluminous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, what a world of nice queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have fallen from the pens of their Canoniſts, and Caſuiſts concerning this ſubject? Certainly this is a point of ſo much uſe and agitation amongſt them, that were it not for the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels ariſing here-from, it is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their conſiſtories would want work, and their Advocates imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But to ſpeak ingenuouſly,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:53799:186"/>
thoſe of the Roman Clientele are not more carefull and punctuall in ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and obſerving the rules and practiſe of their eſpouſalls, then ours here, are incurious of both: How many have we heard to ſay, they will make no promiſe of themſelves till they come to the Church-dore? and of thoſe that do contract themſelves, how weakly and inſufficiently is it performed on many hands? ſo as their act, if queſtioned, is no way obliging; nor ſuch as upon the leaſt diſcontent, will indure a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation.</p>
               <p>Now whereas there is a double contract, or eſpouſall, the one of the future; the other of the preſent: that of the preſent, if it be expreſſed in full termes, differs nothing from marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age it ſelfe, ſave onely in the publique ſolemnization; which doubtleſſe is a ceremony ſo requiſite, as that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it an horrible confuſion muſt
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:53799:187"/>
needs follow both in Church and State.</p>
               <p>That of the future, is a mutuall engagement of both parties that they will marry each other; which is moſt properly an eſpouſall-contract; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving both aſſurance to each other of a mutuall conſent to a Matrimony that ſhall be; and yet withall ſome meet reſpiration of a more full triall, and inquiry into each other conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For which purpoſe the wiſdome of the Church hath ordained that there ſhould be a ſolemn publication of that more private Contract three ſeverall Sabbaths, to the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; not without the earneſt charge of a diſcovery of whatſoever impediment might juſtly hinder the intended matrimony.</p>
               <p>The frequent, but unfit, uſe of theſe Eſpouſall contracts in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, betwixt their children

indiſſoluble, yet theſe eſpouſalls, or contracts of a future marriage, are not ſo: many things may intervene betwixt this engagement by promiſe; and that full and complete, ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization, which may breake off the match.</p>

                  <p>Whether it be neceſſary that marriages ſhould be celebrated by a Miniſter; and whether they may be valid, and lawfull without him.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is no marvell if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (which holds matrimony a Sacrament, conferring Grace by the very worke wrought) require an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity of the Prieſts hand in ſo holy an act; but for us, who (though reverently eſteeming that ſacred inſtitution, yet) ſet it in a key lower, it admits of too much queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether we need to ſtand upon the terms of a Miniſters agency in the performance of that ſolemne action: There are thoſe in theſe wild times that have held it ſufficiently lawfull for the parties having agreed upon the bargaine before friends and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, to betake themſelves to bed:
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:53799:194"/>
others have thought this act of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining the married perſons in wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock a fitter act for the Magiſtrate to undertake. And certainly if there were nothing in marriage but meere nature, it could not be amiſſe that men and women ſhould upon their mutuall agreement couple themſelves together after the manner of brute creatures; And if there were nothing in marriage but meere civility, the Magiſtrate might be meet to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in this ſervice: But now that we Chriſtians know matrimony to be an holy inſtitution of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; which he not onely ordained, but actually celebrated betwixt the firſt Innocent paire; and which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the propagation of an holy ſeed, requires a ſpeciall benediction; how can we in reaſon thinke any man meet for this office, but the man of God, ſet over us in the Lord; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the bleſſings of heaven upon our
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:53799:194"/>
heads? From hence therefore have our wholſome lawes taken a juſt hint to appropriate this ſervice to a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſter onely: ſo as what ever private contract may be tranſacted in corners betwixt the parties affected to each other, yet the marriage-knot cannot be publiquely knit by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, then Gods Miniſters. And herein certainly we have juſt cauſe to bleſſe the wiſdome both of the Church and State, which hath ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated theſe matrimoniall affaires; as that they are not onely orderly but ſafely managed: For doubtleſſe were not this proviſion carefully made, the world would be quite over-run with beaſtlineſſe, and horrible confuſion: And in this point we may well give the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her due, and acknowledge the wiſe care of her Lateran and Tridentine Councells, which have enacted ſo ſtrict Decrees againſt Clandeſtine marriages, and
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:53799:195"/>
have taken ſo ſevere a courſe for the reforming of many foul diſorders in theſe matrimoniall proceedings; as may be of good uſe for the Chriſtian world: Had they done the like in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſes, their light had not gone out in a ſnuffe: As therefore it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally both decreed and obſerved (not without excellent reaſon) in all Chriſtian Churches, that marriages ſhould be ſolemnized in the publique Congregation of Gods people; ſo it cannot but be requiſite that it ſhould be done by him, who is ordained to be the mouth of the Congregation to God; and the mouth of God to the Congregation; And, as under the Law, the Preiſt was the man, who muſt conveigh bleſſings from God to his people; ſo under the Goſpell who can be ſo apt for this divine office, as he that ſerves at the Evangelicall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar? And if all our marriages muſt be (according to the Apoſtles charge)
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:53799:195"/>
made in the Lord, who is ſo meet to pronounce Gods ratification of our marriages, as he who is the profeſt Herald of the Almighty? As it is therefore requiſite (even according to the Roman Conſtitutions) that he who is betruſted with the Cure of our ſoules, ſhould beſides other witneſſes be both preſent and active in, and at our domeſtique contracts of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: ſo by the lawes both of our Church and Kingdome, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he ſhould have his hand in the publique celebration of them.

               <p>IN what onely caſe a divorce may be made after a lawfull marriage, you have ſeen before; now you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the annulling or voiding of marriages made unlawfully: which
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:53799:199"/>
doubtleſſe may be done by juſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon divers well-grounded occaſions: For as it is an indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble charge, <hi>Thoſe whom God hath joined together let no man put aſunder;</hi> ſo it no leſſe truly holds on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; Thoſe whom God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to be joined, let no man keep together.</p>
               <p>Our Caſuiſts are wont to be very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious in this ſubject, diſtinguiſhing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thoſe Impediments which may hinder a Marriage from being made; and thoſe which may undoe and void the Marriage once made. They inſiſt upon many particularities of both kindes; and ſome perhaps too many: I ſhall inſtance onely in thoſe of the latter ſort which are unqueſtionable; whereof the firſt ſhall be a miſ-priſon of the match; when one party is miſtaken for another; as when he who by a full contract conſented to marry with <hi>Anne,</hi> is by a fraudulent
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:53799:200"/>
ſubſtitution put upon a marriage with <hi>Mary;</hi> whether upon the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the woman, or the want of a diſcerning ſenſe in the man; or by ſome cunning conveyance of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious contrivers; For certainly, it is the conſent that makes the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; and if the hearts be not joined together by mutuall agreement and affection, the coupling of the hands is but a ceremony utterly ineffectuall: I doubt not but it was in <hi>Jacobs</hi> power to have diſ-avowed the match with <hi>Leah,</hi> whom his father in law had deceitfully obtruded upon him, being more injurious in changing his wiſe, then in ten-times changing his wages; ſince his heart was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to that match, which the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the night, and the ſuttlety of a <hi>Laban</hi> had drawne him into.</p>
               <p>The like caſe is in the marrying a bond-woman in ſtead of a free; a baſe plebeian in ſtead of a perſon of
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:53799:200"/>
honour: As then we uſe to ſay that miſ-reckoning is no payment, ſo we may well affirme that a miſ-marriage is no true wedlock; and therefore juſtly to be branded with a nullity.</p>
               <p>A ſecond may be the foedity and unnaturalneſſe of the match; when the parties inceſtuouſly marry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the firſt collaterall degree, of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ſiſters; the very mention whereof, even nature it ſelfe, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, abhorres: ſo as I cannot but wonder that the Roman Schoole ſhould be ſo much divided in this point, whiles <note n="*" place="bottom">Martin Alphonſ.

                  <hi>Scotus,</hi> and <hi>Dominicus à Soto</hi> prove ſuch marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by the law of nature to be utterly void and null; with whom all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Chriſtians cannot but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly concurre in their judgements.</p>
               <p>A third may be the horribleneſſe of a crime committed in the way to a wicked match; and that of two ſorts: the one of murther, the other of adultery: The former, when the wife hath conſpired with the adulterer to murder her husband, with an intent to marry the murtherer; or in the like caſe the husband to murther the wife.</p>
               <p>The latter when a man living in a knowne adultery with another mans wife, contracts matrimony with the adultereſſe in the life time of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>

                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:53799:201"/>
A fourth is the indiſſoluble knot of marriage with a former ſtill ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving husband or wife; the force whereof is ſuch, as that it fruſtrates and voideth any ſupervening matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, (except in the caſe ſpecified in the foregoing diſcourſe of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce) during the naturall life of the conſorts. Many unhappy, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed caſes have we met withall in this kinde; neither doth it ſeldome fall out, that the husband being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently reported for dead in the warres, or in travell abroad; the wife after ſome yeares ſtay, and diligent inquiſition, finding the rumour ſtrongly verified by credible teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and tendered oathes, begins to liſten to ſome earneſt ſuitor; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes her ſelfe in a ſecond marriage; not long after which, her onely true, revived husband returnes, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth his right in that his lawfull wife; pretending the miſ-carriage of
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:53799:202"/>
letters and meſſages ſent by him in that forced abſence. In this caſe what is to be done? The woman hath caſt her ſelfe upon the danger of a Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall law, except ſhe have expected the time limited by ſtatute; or if ſhe eſcape one of the husbands is to ſeeke for a wife, whom both may not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy: Doubtleſſe the ſecond marriage, is by Eccleſiaſticall authority to be pronounced, as it is, null; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed never had any true right to be: and the firſt muſt be content to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low its owne inconveniences.</p>
               <p>A fifth may be a violent enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the match: when a woman is upon feare of paine, or death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to yeeld her ſelfe in marriage, and is not perſwaded, but affrighted into the bonds of wedlock: ſurely this is rather a rape then a matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and therefore, upon utter want of conſent, a nullity.</p>
               <p>A ſixt may be a preceding, irreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diable
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:53799:202"/>
impotency, or incapacity of marriage duties; whether naturall, or advantageous; whether by way of petpetuall maleficiation, or caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty: I ſay, preceding; for if any ſuch diſability be ſubſequent to the marriage, the nullity is avoided; But if the perſons finde in themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand ſuch remedileſſe incapabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a marriage eſtate, they ſhall be highly injurious to each other, and ſhall foulely abuſe the ordinance of God in their entring into ſuch a condition: For it is apparent, that the maine ends of marriage are herein utterly fruſtrate; which were by Gods appointment, the propagation of mankinde, and the remedy of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency; neither of which being attaineable in ſuch a defective eſtate of body, juſtly is ſuch a match pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a nullity.</p>
               <p>But here I cannot but take occaſion to commend the modeſty of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

Certainly the merit of this modeſt temper is ſo much the greater, by how much more it is concealed from the world; and thoſe of either ſexe that are content to bite in their hidden grievances of this kinde, are worthy of double

ſilently lament, then openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime to the world: Such as are not capable of any Apology, call for our bluſhing and teares; but there are ſome others which dare ſtand upon the termes of defence: Such is this which you have here propounded on the behalf of your friend, whom it ſeemes a miſ-learned Advocate would faine bear up in a courſe alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unjuſtifiable; that cauſe muſt needs be deſperately ill, that can find no mercenary abettors: His offenſive marriage with his Necce is hartned by a ſophiſticall pleader; whoſe wit and skil is ſo ill beſtowed in this caſe, that I wiſh his fee might be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſilence: but when he hath made uſe of his beſt art to ſo bad a purpoſe, thoſe colours of defence, wherewith he thinks to daub over ſo foul a cauſe will prove but water-colours, which ſhall eaſily be waſh'd off by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent confutation.</p>

It was lawfull, he ſaith, before the Leviticall Law, thus to Match: So were worſe Marriages then this: Let him tell me that <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Seth</hi> married their owne Siſters; as <hi>Saturne</hi> alſo did, by the report of <hi>Diodorus Siculús;</hi> Neceſſity made it then not unlawfull: It is a juſt rule of <note n="*" place="bottom">In Argumentum trati nequeunt, quae propter ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitatem ſunt conceſſa.</note> Law, Thoſe things may not be drawne into precedent, which have been yeelded upon mere neceſſity; as we uſe to ſay that neceſſity hath no law, ſo it can make none. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as mankinde grew, nature it ſelfe taught men to keep further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loofe from their owne fleſh; and ſtill remoteneſſe of diſtance enlarged it ſelfe with time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> (ſaith he) married his neece <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 11. 29. (if at leaſt <hi>Sarah</hi> were <hi>Iſcah) Nahor</hi> his neece <hi>Milcha, Amram</hi> his Aunt <hi>Jochebed;</hi>
                     <pb n="386" facs="tcp:53799:206"/>
and theſe not without a large bleſſing upon the bed. Let him tell me alſo, that <hi>Jacob</hi> married two Siſters, and converſed conjugally with both (which were now ſhamefully inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) yet was herein bleſſed with the iſſue of ſixe of thoſe <hi>Patriarohs,</hi> who were the root of thoſe glorious ſtemmes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> If we ſhould ſpeak moſt flavourably of theſe conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to ranke them under <hi>malum quia prohibitum,</hi> it muſt needs follow, that till the prohibition came, they could not be cenſured as evill: Though good Authors make it juſtly queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable, whether theſe fore-alledged marriages ſhould deſervedly be charged with a ſin, or excuſed by Gods extraordinary diſpenſation; in the meane time the bleſſing was to the perſon, not to the act: even <hi>Lots</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous copulation with his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſped well; two famous nations ſprang thence, and of one of them,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:53799:206"/>
the gracious progenitrice of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world; Yet this is no plea for the allowance of that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous conjunction. After the law, one juſtifiable example were worth a thouſand before it.</p>
                  <p>Lo, good <hi>Caleb</hi> (ſaith he) married his daughter <hi>Achſah</hi> to his brother <hi>Othoniel. Joſhua.</hi> 15. 16, 17. Indeed, this caſe comes as home to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as it is farre off from the text. See whether meſ-priſon of Scripture may miſlead us: A man that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands nothing but the Engliſh, or Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latin, may eaſily run into ſo foul an error; weigh but the place well, and you will ſoone finde the fault without me; <hi>Othniel</hi> the ſon of <hi>Kenaz, Calebs</hi> brother, tooke <hi>Kerath-Sepher,</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> gave him <hi>Achſah</hi> his daughter to wife; The Engliſh wanting caſes expreſſes it doubtfully, it will be cleare in the Latin; as <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus,</hi> and <hi>Pagnine,</hi> two great Maſters
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:53799:207"/>
of the Hebrew in their <hi>Interlinear,</hi> read it, <hi>Othniel filius Kenaz, fratris Calebi; Othniel</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Kenaz,</hi> which <hi>Kenaz</hi> was <hi>Caleb's</hi> brother, Both the Hebrew and Chaldee cleare that ſenſe: So the Septuagint, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel Sa</hi> alſo urges upon that place, <hi>Judg.</hi> 1. 13. expreſsly ſay that <hi>Kenaz</hi> was the brother of <hi>Caleb,</hi> and not <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoniel;</hi> wherein yet I cannot much blame an unballanced judgement, whiles I find the Septuagint contrary to themſelves: For in <hi>Joſh.</hi> 15. 16. they ſay, <hi>Othniel</hi> was <hi>Caleb</hi>'s younger brother; In <hi>Judg.</hi> 3. 9. they ſay, <hi>Kenaz</hi> the father of <hi>Othniel</hi> was ſo; for which there is no excuſe, but the large ſenſe of a Brother in the Hebrew, <hi>We are brethren,</hi> ſaith <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Lot,</hi> yet he was <hi>Lot's</hi> Uncle: So was <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naz</hi> a Progenitor to <hi>Othniel,</hi> for <hi>Caleb</hi> is ſtyled the ſonne of <hi>Jephunneh</hi> the Kenezite, <hi>Joſh, 14. 14. &amp; Numb.</hi> 32. 12. The caſe was onely this, <hi>Kenaz</hi> was
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:53799:207"/>
the Anceſtor of <hi>Caleb;</hi> and one of the ſame name was his brother, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Othniel:</hi> what can be more plain then 1 <hi>Chron. 4. 13. And the ſons of Kenaz, Othniel and Seraiah;</hi> So as if we take this moſt ſtrictly to the letter, it implies nothing but the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of two Cozens German, <hi>Othniel</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Kenaz,</hi> and <hi>Achſah</hi> the daughter of <hi>Galeb,</hi> Brothers chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as <hi>Bucer</hi> upon the place, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanehton</hi> in his Tract <hi>De Conjugio, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius;</hi> and indeed, who otherwiſe? And now by this time you ſee what a poore ground this is to build upon; rather, you ſee a caſtle, not built on the ſand, but in the ayre; meer miſ-conceit.</p>
                  <p>But, ſaith the Advocate, this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is no where directly forbidden in the Law; I muſt tell him it is but a meer ſhuffle to ſtand upon the termes of a Direct prohibition, when there is one no leſſe forceable, and convictive:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="390" facs="tcp:53799:208"/>
Two wayes may ought be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally forbidden in the law; Either in plain expreſſion of termes, or in clear implication of ſenſe; ſurely, that is rather more in the law which it means irrefragably, than what it verbally expreſſeth: Now, however this be not in the letter of the law, yet in the ſenſe it is: The ſame law that forbids the Nephew to marry the Aunt, doth <hi>eadem opera,</hi> forbid the Uncle to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Neece; In regard as of near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yea identity of blood, the caſe is the ſame; however, ſome inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity may be conceived in reſpect of government, and ſubjection: And if upon ſome oeconomicall termes, it be more unfit for a Nephew to marry his Aunt, than for an Uncle to marry his Neece, yet in regard of blood, and that bodily conjunction, which God principally aymes at in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, what difference can poſſibly be conceived? Nature hath made no
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:53799:208"/>
other diſtance betwixt the Nephew, &amp; the Aunt, than betwixt the Neece and Uncle: or if there be any, they muſt be ſharper eyes than mine that can diſcerne it: God himſelfe (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks) hath put this out of doubt; the reaſon wherewith he backs his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand is irreſiſtible; The Nephew ſhall not marry the Fathers Siſter; why ſo? <hi>For ſhe is thy Fathers neare Kinſwoman, ver.</hi> 12. Lo, it is the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of blood that makes this match unlawfull, not reſpect of civill ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality; Where the blood then is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually neare, the marriage muſt be equally unlawfull.</p>
                  <p>That rule of Law which is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>In prohibitoriis, quicquid non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibetur, permittitur;</hi> What is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, is permitted, had need of a faire conſtruction; Indeed, that which is not forbidden either in words, or in neceſſary analogie and implication of ſenſe, is ſuppoſed to be left at large;
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:53799:209"/>
But what place hath this Axiome in a caſe not leſſe really forbidden, than the expreſſed? And if wee ſhould ſtrictly follow the letter of this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime, it would lead us into <hi>Sodome;</hi> ſince there are mariages not ſpecified, which would be monſtrouſly inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſuch as honeſty would bluſh to mention, as ſhall appeare in the ſequele.</p>
                  <p>Neither is there any more force in that other, <hi>In poenalibus non fit exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio,</hi> That penall lawes ſhould not be ſtretcht further, then their words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Certainly, in ſome ſenſe I know no law that is not penall; but why this law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not marry thy Aunt or Neece</hi> ſhould be rather penall, than, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery,</hi> I know not; I am ſure learned <hi>Zanchius</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts theſe of the 18. of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> equally morall: and <hi>Bucanus</hi> holds them to be againſt the law of nature.</p>
                  <p>And if in humane laws this axiome
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:53799:209"/>
may challenge a place, yet in the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all lawes of our Maker, where, under one ſin mentioned, all the ſpecies and appendances, and the whole claime of that wickedneſſe is wont to be compriſed, doubtleſſe it is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable; Neither is here any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of this prohibition beyond thoſe limits which God hath fixed in the undoubted ſenſe of his law; In the ſeventh Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, nothing is expreſſed but <hi>adultery,</hi> ſhall wee therefore ſay neither <hi>fornication,</hi> nor <hi>pollution,</hi> nor <hi>ſodomie</hi> is there for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden? were not this to deſtroy that law, which God makes to be ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; and to open the flood-gates to a torrent of licentiouſneſſe? ſurely, it is eaſie to obſerve that Gods Spirit no leſſe meanes that which he pleaſeth to ſuppreſſe. The Pſalmiſt ſayes, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion comes neither from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the South, Pſal.</hi> 75. 6. Shall we therefore ſay, It is
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:53799:210"/>
from the North? Is not that coaſt equally excluded, though not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? It is too much boldneſs to hold God too ſtrictly to ſyllables, when it is eaſie to determine what he meant to imply: Theſe rules then are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe: Let me ſee now if the Advocate can as eaſily ſhake off one or two rules of law, which I ſhall returne up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in lieu of his. <hi>Is committit in legem, &amp;c.</hi> He wrongs the law who keeping cloſe to the letter, ſtrives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the intent and purpoſe of the law; And that other not unlike, <hi>In fraudem legis facit qui ſalvis verbis legis ſententiam ejus circumvenit,</hi> If this be not the caſe in hand, I ſhall profeſſe to know nothing.</p>
                  <p>From Rules, let us look to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, It is directly maintained (he ſaith) by the Canoniſts, and Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; But what is it, that is ſo main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? Not this match (let no man thinke ſo) but that propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <pb n="395" facs="tcp:53799:210"/>
that this match is no where directly forbidden in Gods law; If we take it of expreſs termes, no wiſe man ever denied it; not Canoniſts, and Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men onely, or thoſe few named Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, but all reaſonable men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in this truth; what needs a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſome, where all agree? But if we take it of the neceſſary &amp; cleare ſenſe of the law by juſt Analogie and infallible implication, now, none of the forecited, or any other orthodox Authours will deny the certaine and indubitable prohibition of this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. How well the reſt will ſpeed, judge by their fore-man, <hi>Tho: Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas;</hi> who expreſsly determines it a falſe poſition, that thoſe are joyned together by God, who match within the fourth degree; whereas this is in the third; Not to ſay how ſtifly <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> urges the unlawfulneſſe of marriages to the very ſeventh degree, <hi>vel quouſque parentela poſsit agnoſci,</hi>
                     <pb n="396" facs="tcp:53799:211"/>
even as farre as the kinred may be diſcern'd, following herein Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> and <hi>Nicholas:</hi> To ſhut up ſhort, none of all his cited Authors dare be any other then profeſſed enemies to this match; no leſſe, then the moſt zealous Commiſſioner of that now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aboliſhed Court, whoſe late ſentence is upon Record enough to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Lyra,</hi> who is trayled in here, and cited ſtrongly in <hi>Othoniels</hi> caſe, what ſhall I ſay? It grieves my ſoule to ſee any well-minded Chriſtian ſo abuſed by miſ-information: This au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath thus, <hi>Turpitudinom Sororis, &amp;c.</hi> Thou ſhalt not uncover the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of thy Fathers Siſter, or thy Mothers Siſter, <hi>(&amp; eodum modo)</hi> and in the ſame manner is forbidden the marriage betwixt the brother, and the daughter of the Aunt, for it is the ſame degree: ſo <hi>Lyra:</hi> Nothing can be more peremptory againſt this caſe,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:53799:211"/>
in favour of which he is alledged.</p>
                  <p>This would be the iſſue of all the reſt, if it were worth the while to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them, in that, which yeelded, nothing advanceth the cauſe of the producer. They are all as profeſſed enemies to this match as my ſelfe; onely they deny an expreſſe mention of this cauſe, which was never either thought needfull, or intended to be pleaded.</p>
                  <p>For the Proteſtant Divines w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are cited to give Teſtimony to the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prohibition of this marriage, I muſt cry ſhame upon thoſe falſe hands, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> have ſo palpably abuſed both your friend, and the Authors; Let me give but a taſte of ſome, <hi>Melancthon, Zanchius, Bucanus;</hi> who are ſaid to allow the match, by admitting onely the degrees mentioned to be prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited; No place is inſtanced, <hi>verſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in generalibus;</hi> You know the word, but let your eyes be judges of
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:53799:212"/>
their opinion; <hi>Melancthon,</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the marriage of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> in the ſecond degree: <hi>Hoc gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du</hi> ſaith he) <hi>in linea inaequali &amp;c.</hi> In this degree, in an inequall line, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages are forbidden by Gods law, becauſe God doth univerſally or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine a greater reverence to be yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Superiour degree, then to an equall; It is the very caſe in hand, which <hi>Melancthon</hi> thus ſentenceth; For <hi>Zanchius;</hi> he citing the text of <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. 13. Thou ſhalt not unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the nakedneſſe of thy Mothers Siſter; adds, <hi>ergo ne<expan>
                           <am>

                           </am>

                        </expan> mater teram, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore no man, ſaith he, may marry his Aunt; and that charge, which he gives concerning the Aunt, would God have to be underſtood alſo of the Uncle, which is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers brother, or the Mothers bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whiles he addes a reaſon of the prohibition, For ſhe is the neare kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman of thy Father, or Mother;
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:53799:212"/>
Thus <hi>Zanchius</hi> in his booke <hi>de Operi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Dei.</hi> Lib. 4. <hi>de Sponſalibus;</hi> who abſolutely condemnes this marriage as inceſtuous, and indiſpenſable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bucanus,</hi> moving the caſe of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> marriage with <hi>Sarah,</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rams</hi> with <hi>Jochebed</hi> &amp;c. Leaves it in doubt whether theſe men were (as the times ſtood) particularly diſpenſed with by God, or whether they ſinned in thus marrying, even before the law, againſt the law of nature, by which he holds theſe matches utterly prohibited; With what forhead then, could any Schollar obtrude theſe falſe allegations upon an honeſt cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, whether to draw his foot into a ſnare, or to keepe it there, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of favouring what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly oppoſe.</p>
                  <p>As for the moderne Jewes, to whom he ſtretches out his hand for ſuccour, it matters little what they now teach or doe; they are not more
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:53799:213"/>
without God, then without honeſty, or credit; Their opinions are fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, their judgement frivolous, and their practice not worth our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or regard.</p>
                  <p>I rather deſcend to the reſolution of our owne Church; That our ever honored Mother hath paſſed her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnatorie ſentence upon this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in her Ratification of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxe and juſt Table of forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Degrees, ſet forth by authority under Archb. <hi>Parker,</hi> what doubt we now? Doe we acknowledge the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Voice of our dear and holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church of England, and yet queſtion whether we ſhould obey it? Certainly in a caſe of Conſcience, a dutifull ſonne (me thinks) ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hold fit to follow the ſacred de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Church, then the municipall Acts of the civill ſtate. It is an ill office of thoſe that would ſet Church, and State, Canons and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:53799:213"/>
together by the eares even in theſe points wherein they are perfect friends.</p>
                  <p>The ſtatute of 32. of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. c. 38. intending to marre the Romiſh market of gainfull diſpenſations, and injurious prohibitions, profeſſeth to allow all marriages that are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by Gods Law; ſuch is this in hand; prohibited, though not in the Letter, yet in neceſſary inference, and interpretation; The Canon 99, of 1603. hath thus; No perſon ſhall marry within the degrees prohibited by the lawes of God, and expreſſed in a Table ſet forth by Authority in the yeare 1563. and all marriages ſo made and contracted ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged inceſtuous and unlawfull.</p>
                  <p>What ſcruple can ariſe hence? here is a perfect harmonie betwixt ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and Canon. It is a mere Cavill (no better) to take And for Or; as if the meaning were, that all degrees
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:53799:214"/>
whether prohibited by the law of God, or expreſſed in that Table are forbidden; This is a foule ſtraine both to Grammer, and to the ſence and Scope of the Canon, which plainly intends to averre that all thoſe degrees prohibited in that Table are alſo forbidden by the lawes of God; A truth ſo certaine, that if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſelfe-love, or love of gaine did not betray the eye, it is a wonder how it ſhould abide a contradiction.</p>
                  <p>It is obſervable that neither ſtatute, nor Canon ſpeake of an expreſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition in Gods Law; And the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non purpoſely diſtinguiſheth the termes prohibited by Gods Law, and expreſſed in the Table, as juſtly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, there may be as ſtrong a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition in a ſenſe implyed, as ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bally expreſſed: Elſe, if our Lawes (as is pretended) ſhould give allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance (which God forbid) to any marriages not expreſly <hi>interminis,</hi>
                     <pb n="403" facs="tcp:53799:214"/>
forbidden; we ſhould have ſtrange and uncouth mixtures.</p>
                  <p>God by <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſly forbad the uncovering the nakedneſſe of Father and Mother; he expreſſed not the nakedneſſe of Son, and Daughter: He expreſly names the nakedneſſe of the Fathers wife, he expreſſeth not the nakedneſſe of the Mothers huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; He expreſly names the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thy Siſter; he expreſſeth not the nakedneſſe of thy Brother; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the nakedneſſe of thy Sons Daughter, he expreſſeth not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of thy Daughters Son: He expreſſeth the nakedneſſe of thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Wives Daughter, he expreſſeth not the Mothers Husbands Sonne; he expreſſeth the Fathers Siſter, not the Mothers Brother; He expreſſes the Daughter-in-law, not the Son-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law. So as by this Rule, if it ſhould be carried onely by meer verball ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, a Woman might marry her
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:53799:215"/>
Son-in-law; the Nephew might mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his great Aunt, the Neece her great Unkle; the Daughter might marry her Mothers Husbands Sonne; the Grand mother might marry her Daughters Son; the Daughter might marry with her Mothers Husband; Were theſe things to be allowed, the world would be all <hi>Sodome:</hi> Theſe things therefore are of neceſſity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Law by a cleare Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie; no leſſe then if they had been expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>But have there been (as he ſaith) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents of this match? I am ſory to heare it; ſurely, the more the worſe; and the more need to redreſſe it: the addition of this, if neglected, would help to ſtrengthen an ill claime.</p>
                  <p>Cozens German, he ſaith, have been allowed to marry; What is that to the preſent caſe? The difference is as much as betwixt a Nephew and an Uncle; The Uncle hath too much of
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:53799:215"/>
the Parents both right, and blood, to challenge an equall claime with a Cozen.</p>
                  <p>In the ſhutting up, it pitties me to ſee your worthy Friend driven to this plea; and like a drowning man, to ſnatch at ſo ſmall a twigge; <hi>Being done</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>it ought not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</hi> Alas, the Canon is peremptory; It is inceſtuous and unlawfull; what plea is there for continuance?

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether it be lawfull for a man to marry his Wives Brothers Widow.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AMongſt all the heads of Caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divinity there is no one that yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth more ſeruples, then this of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, whether we regard the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Perſons, or the emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of actions, and events. It is the lawfulneſſe of this match that you inquire after, not the expedience, and I muſt ſhape my anſwer accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
               <p>It hath been the wiſdome and care of our godly and prudent Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, to ordaine a Table of all the prohibited degrees to be publiquely hang'd up in all the ſeverall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this Nation; to which all Commers might have recourſe for ſatisfaction: This Catalogue you have peruſed, and find no exception of the
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:53799:216"/>
caſe ſpecified; I know no reaſon therefore why you may not conclude it not unlawfull.</p>
               <p>The queſtion of the Expedience would require another debate; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, in all caſes of this nature, it muſt needs be yeilded that it were more meet, and ſafe (ſince the world yeilds ſo large a latitude of choice) to look further off; A wiſe and good man will not willingly treſpaſſe againſt the rules of juſt expedience: and will be as carefull to conſider what is fit to be done, as what is lawfull; but that comes not, at this time, within your inquiry.</p>
               <p>Whiles therefore I give my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the lawfulneſſe of this Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with the Relict of the Wives bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I doe no whit claſh (as you ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt) with the judgment of <hi>Beza,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Perkins,</hi> who profeſſe their diſlike of ſuch copulations: I ſhall as readily cry them downe for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:53799:217"/>
and inconvenient, as thoſe, that with too much boldneſſe come over neare to the Verge of a ſinfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juction; but for the not unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this match, I did upon the firſt hearing, give my affirmative an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: and the more I conſider of it, I am the more confirmed in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
               <p>That univerſall rule mentioned by you, as layd down by thoſe two wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Authors, muſt indure a limitation; <hi>Cujus non licet inire nuptias, ejus nec conjugis licet;</hi> that there is the ſame degree and force of relation of a third perſon (in the caſe of marriage) to the husband, and to the wife; ſo as proximity of blood in the one, ſhould not be a greater barre, then the ſame proximity of alliance in the other; Otherwiſe, many more copulations will fall under cenſure, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice will condeſcend unto; and that ground of, <hi>uxor pars quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:53799:217"/>
viri,</hi> The Wife is as a part of the Husband, as it holds not in naturall relation, at all, ſo not in all conjugall; as might be too eaſily inſtanced in divers particulars.</p>
               <p>And if there were not ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in theſe relations, thoſe ſecond perſons which are intereſſed in the Husband, or Wife, might not come neare to the next in affinity to them; For example, my Brother may not marry my Siſter, therefore by this rule, he might not marry my Wives Siſter, and ſo it ſhould be unlawfull for two Brothers, to marry two Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; then which nothing is more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, or leſſe obnoxious to diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance.</p>
               <p>That generall rule therefore, muſt be reſtrained neceſſarily, to the firſt rank of affinity; if we deſcend lower, it holds not. For further explanation, our Civilians and Canoniſts are wont to make two kindes or degrees of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:53799:218"/>
Affinity, The one Primary, the other Secondary; In the firſt, is the affinity betwixt the Husband, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of blood to his Wife, or, <hi>è con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſo;</hi> which indeed, is juſtly held no leſſe for a barre of marriage, then his own naturall conſanguinity; for that is an affinity contracted upon intereſt of blood, by vertue of that entire u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, betwixt Man and Wife, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they both become one fleſh; The Secondary affinity is that, wherein there is another Perſon added more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to that firſt kinde, now menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; the affinity ariſing onely from the intereſt of an affinity, formerly contracted, not from conſanguinity; and this is not ſo binding, as either to hinder a marriage to be contracted, or being contracted, to diſſolve it.</p>
               <p>In this rank are the Brothers Wife, and Siſters Husband; and therefore, upon the deceaſe of the Brother and Siſter, the Husband of the Siſter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:53799:218"/>
and the Wife of the deceaſed Brother may marry together, as Dr. <hi>Nicholaus Everhardus</hi> out of <hi>Richar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus de Media Villa,</hi> and <hi>Panormitan,</hi> hath clearly determined <note n="*" place="bottom">Conſil. Matrimonial. Germanor. Conſil. 5.</note>; Of this kind is the Marriage now queſtioned, which therefore doth not fall within the compaſſe of the prohibition, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum genus affinitatis, &amp;c.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond kinde of affinity, which is by a Perſon added unto the firſt kinde is no barre to Matrimony; And with this judgment I find no reaſon why I ſhould not concurre; but if any man thinke that he ſees juſt ground to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine a contrary opinion, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge him not, but modeſtly leave him to the freedome of his owne thoughts.</p>

               <head>CASE III.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Whether an inceſtuous Marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in ſimplicity of heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two Perſons ignorant of ſuch a deſilement, and ſo farre conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate as that Children are borne in that wedlocke, ought to be made knowne and proſecuted to a diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is a queſtion (as it may be put) full of doubt and intricacy, Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel whereunto, and eminent in this kinde, was that caſe, which I had long ſince, from the relation of M. <hi>Perkins,</hi> and ſince that, have met with it in the report of two ſeverall German Authours.</p>
               <p>The caſe thus: A Gentlewoman of great note in thoſe parts, being left a Widow, had her Sonne trained up in her houſe; who now having paſſed the age of his puberty, grew up, as in ſtature, ſo in wanton deſires; earneſtly
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:53799:219"/>
ſoliciting her Chamber-maid to his luſt; ſhe had the grace, not onely to repell his offers, but being wearied with his wicked importunity, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine to her Miſtreſſe, of his impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous motions: The Mother out of a purpoſe to repreſſe this wild hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in her Sonne, bids the Maid, in a ſeeming yeildance to make appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the night following with him, at which time ſhe would change beds with the Maid, and ſchool the young man to purpoſe. This being accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly done, the Devil ſo farre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with the Mother, that in ſtead of chaſtiſing, ſhe yeilded to the luſt of her Sonne, and by him conceived a Daughter: and now finding her ſelfe to grow bigge, for the hiding of her ſhame, ſhe retired ſecretly to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote part of the countrey, where ſhe unknowne left the burden of her wombe, and tooke order for all care &amp; ſecrecy of education: After ſome
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:53799:220"/>
yeares the Mother thinks fit to call home her concealed iſſue, under the pretence of a Kinſwoman, and gives her ſuch breeding in her houſe, as might become the Child of a Friend: The Maid grew up to ſuch comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, both of perſon, and behaviour, that the Sonne, now growne a Man, fell into paſſionate love with her; and in ſhort, married her; little thinking that he was now matched with his owne Daughter, begotten by him of his own Mother: They lived loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and comfortably together, and had divers Children betwixt them. Onely the Mother, who was alone conſcious of this monſtrous copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, began to finde an hell in her boſome; and in a deep remorſe, made the caſe, at laſt, knowne to ſome learned Divines of that time, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed many ſerious thoughts upon ſo uncouth a buſineſſe; and finally agreed upon this determination, That
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:53799:220"/>
all circumſtances throughly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the penitent Mother ſhould after a ſould humiliation ſecretly make her peace with God, for ſo foule and prodigious a ſin; but that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the horrible inceſtuouſneſſe of this match, ſhould ſtill, and ever be concealed from the yong couple, who thought of nothing, but a faire and honeſt legality in this their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.</p>
               <p>The deciſion of this point comes ſomewhat home to yours; to ſpend my opinion therefore in this caſe, I finde no reaſon, all things conſidered, to vary from their judgment.</p>
               <p>I ſay then, that the Mothers ſinne was not more haynous in yeilding to ſo abominable an act of inceſt with her Son, then in ſmothering the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable notice of it for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a worſe inceſt with her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for that firſt act of her inceſt was tranſient, but this inceſt which was
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:53799:221"/>
occaſioned by her ſilence was perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and derivable to her poſterity: She ought therefore, though to her perpetuall ſhame, when ſhe ſaw an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in her Sonne to ſo foulely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unnaturall a match, to have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled it by a free confeſſion, and to have made him ſenſible of ſo odious a procation: Which not being done, it muſt needs be ſaid, that, as the firſt act of the Sonne was a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary fornication, but an involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary inceſt; ſo this inceſtuous copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Sonne with the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was involuntary in them both; and there cannot be an actuall ſinne, wherein there is not a conſent of the will.</p>
               <p>On the one ſide, it is ſhamefull to thinke that ſo grievous a ſinne ſhould paſſe without ſome exemplary cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and that ſo foule blood ſhould be propagated to ſucceeding ages, for want of the timely intervention of a
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:53799:221"/>
vindicative authority; but on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, it would be well conſidered what miſerable inconveniences, yea miſcheifes would follow upon ſo late a diſcoverie; Firſt all honeſt hearts are put into a juſt, but unprofitable horrour, to thinke that ſueh a flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wickedneſſe could be committed; Then the Mother who had rinced her ſoule, with a fountaine of teares, for ſo hatefull a miſ-carriage, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled her ſelfe to that God, who was the onely witneſſe of her ſin, ſhould be ſo late expoſed to the unſeaſonable ſhame of that world, which never was privie to her offence.</p>
               <p>As for the young couple thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly conjoyned, how could they chooſe, upon the too late notice of their ſo deplorable condition, but run mad for anguiſh of ſoule, and weare out the reſt of their dayes in ſhame, and ſorrow; And for the children borne to them in ſo deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:53799:222"/>
a wedlock, whom they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly beheld with complacence, and comfort, as the ſweet pledges of their conjugall love, how muſt they now needs looke upon them, as the living monuments of their ignominie; and loath them as the moſt baſely-begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten impes of a worſe then beſtiall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation. And when riper age ſhould bring that unhappy off-ſpring forth into the world, how ſhould they be every where pointed at, and hooted after; as ſome ſtrange aberrations of nature; all which are avoyded by this ſeorecy.</p>
               <p>But if on the other ſide you ſhall reply that this one evill is more, then equivalent to all theſe; that in the meane time, theſe parties live in a continuall Inceſt, and traduce it to following generations; I muſt put you in minde, to diſtinguiſh, betwixt the ſtate of Inceſt, and the Sin of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt; It is true, they live in a ſtate of
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:53799:222"/>
Inceſt, but, from the ſin of Inceſt they are excuſed by an ignorance, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther invincible; an ignorance both of the originall fact, and of their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual relations; for it is to be ſuppoſed, that had they had the leaſt intimation of the naturall intereſt of Father, and daughter, they would with much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation have defied ſo foule a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture, which even brute creatures (if we may beleeve hiſtories) have by the inſtinct of nature abominated, and, upon after knowledge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged.</p>
               <p>And if any light of knowledge ſhould have broken forth unto the parties, of that condition, wherein they ſtood, then to have continued under that ſtate of Inceſt, but an houre, had beene damnably ſinfull; now all thoſe inevitable conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſhame and horrour muſt have beene ſleighted and forgotten, and muſt have ſhut up in a ſodaine diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="420" facs="tcp:53799:223"/>
But, as there are many degrees of Inceſt; and the ſin is ſo much more, or leſſe haynous, as the parties are nearer, or more remote; I perceive the caſe intimated by you, concernes a lower ranke of inceſtuous copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; namely, an inceſt ariſing from a mans carnall knowledge of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon too neare in blood unto her, whom he afterwards marrieth; The fact knowne onely by one, who now doubts whether he be not bound to reveale it: And why not ſooner, when ſo faulty a match might have beene prevented? Why ſo late, when the remedy intended, would be as noxious as the diſeaſe? Why at all, when there is no neceſſity, or uſe of the revelation? This queſtion ſtarts another more univerſall, how farre we may, or ought to make known the ſecret ſin of another? Doubtleſſe to prevent ſome enormious act, which may follow upon our ſilence; or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:53799:223"/>
the urging of lawfull authority, when we are called to give evidence concerning a fact queſtioned; Or to antevert ſome great danger to the publique, to our ſelves, to our friend, we may, and muſt diſcloſe our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a cloſe wickedneſſe; Or if the act be ſo haynouſly flagitious, and redounding to ſo high dishonour of God, as that our conſcience tels us we ſhall participate of this ſinne in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing it; our holy zeale ſhall herein beare us out in a juſt accuſation; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in this caſe, heed muſt be taken, that our ſingle crimination may be ſo carried and made good by circumſtances, that it draw us not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the perill of a ſclander; But, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe, I cannot ſee, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing of a ſecret ſinne, can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued any otherwiſe, than an act of Detraction; than which, nothing can be more odious and prejudiciall to humane ſociety: We have learn'd
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:53799:224"/>
from <hi>Aquinas</hi> that there are eight wayes of this hatefull practice; whereof foure are direct; the rayſing of a falſe crime, the amplifying of a true crime; the diſcloſing of a crime ſecret, and the ſiniſter conſtruction of anothers fact. To theſe, I muſt adde, that even where the act is ſuch as challengeth a revelation, the time may be unſeaſonable, and paſt the date; You know that the notice of treaſon, if too long ſmothered, draws the concealer into danger: and in this caſe, though there be no perill in the ſilence, yet there may be injurie: Shortly, this ſin, if ever, ſhould have been ſo early made known to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concerned, as might have preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the making up of a match ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinfull; and have convinced the agent of a foule illegality, whereof he was ignorant. But now thus over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, would break out to an unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vexation; ſince this crime which
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:53799:224"/>
might juſtly have hindred the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age from being contracted, ought not to have the force, after ſo long intermiſſion, and ſucceſſe of an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient wedlock, to diſſolve it. The time was, when the Miniſter in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne preconization, called you ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>then to ſpeake,</hi> or <hi>for ever after to hold your peace:</hi> had you then ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it might have beene conſtrued as Zeale, now, not to hold your peace, will be interpreted no better then malice.</p>
