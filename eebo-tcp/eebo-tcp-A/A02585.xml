         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

mands the Angels: <hi>Francis</hi> of

Els, to what purpoſe

Chriſt gaue vs the keyes;
(for that which the Romaniſts
would plead out of <hi>Origen,</hi> of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
coeli, The keyes of heauen</hi> to the
reſt, and <hi>Claues coelorum, The keyes

without a difference);
What becomes of them? That
I may not ſay on ſome of our
hands they are ſuffered to ruſt
for want of vſe; on others, (as
the Pontificians) the wards are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:27762:8"/>
altered, ſo as they can neither
open nor ſhut; Sure I am that
(if they be not loſt on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
whether in diſ-vſe, or
abuſe) the power of them is loſt
in the hearts of many: They
haue ſecret pick-locks of their
owne making, Preſumption and
ſecuritie, wherby they can open
heauen gates though double
locked by our cenſures, and ſhut
the gates of hell at pleaſure,
which their owne ſinnes haue
opened wide to receiue them;
What vſe is there of vs, but in
our chayre? and there, but to be
heard, and ſeene? Euen in this
ſenſe <hi>ſpectaculo facti ſumus;</hi> we
are to gaze on, not to imploy:
Now yee are full, now yee are

rich, yee raigne as Kings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vs; we are weake, yee are
ſtrong; yee are honorable, but
wee are deſpiſed; It was well
noted by one, that the good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the prodigall, though he
might himſelfe haue brought
forth the prime robe; or haue
led his ſonne into his wardrobe
to take it, yet he commands his
ſeruants to bring it forth <hi>(Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferte
ſtolam)</hi> becauſe he would
bring meanes into credit; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he would haue his ſonnes
beholden to his ſeruants for
their glory. It is a bold word,
but a true one, Yee ſhall neuer
weare the long white robe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
his ſeruants your miniſters
bring it, and put it on. He that

can ſaue you without vs, will
not ſaue you but by vs: He hath
not tyed himſelfe to meanes,
man he hath; He could create
you immediatly to himſelfe, but
hee will haue you begotten by
the immortall ſeed of your ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
fathers: Woe be to you
therefore, if our word haue loſt
the power of it in you: you
haue loſt your right in heauen:
Let vs neuer come there if you
can come thither ordinarily
without vs. The words of the
wife (ſaith <hi>Salomon)</hi> are like
goades, like nayles; But if theſe
goades light vpon the skin of a
Leuiathan, who eſteemes yron
as ſtraw, and braſſe as rotten
wood; If theſe nayles meete
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:27762:9"/>
with yron, or marble in their
driuing, that they turne againe;

            <p>Hitherto the power implyed
in this charge; the ſufficiencie
followeth: This <hi>Euangelicus</hi>
muſt be <hi>parangelicus;</hi> Like as the

charge for all ſorts, ſo muſt his
followers; So hath <hi>Timothy</hi> in
this Epiſtle, A charge for wiues,
for Biſhops, for Deacons, for
widdowes, for ſeruants, and here
for the rich; He muſt charge;

As for the learning and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie

of thoſe Teachers (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:27762:12"/>
I am ſure in this it exceeds all.
There is not a Citie vnder the

Heare this, yee Citizens, and be

               <hi>Charge the Rich;</hi> Who are they?
There is nothing wherein is
greater meſpriſon. One man
in a Laodicean conceitednes
thinks himſelfe rich, when he
hath nothing; Another, in a
couetous humor thinks he hath
nothing, when he is rich; and
how eaſie is it for another man
to miſtake vs, if we may thus
eaſily miſtake our ſelues? I feare
ſome of you are like the Page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
of your great ſolemnities,

wherein there is the ſhow of a
ſolid body, whether of a Lyon,

if they be curiouſly look't into,
there is nothing but cloth, and
ſticks, and ayre; Others of you
contrarily are like a diſſembling
Couent, that profeſſes pouerty, &amp;
purchaſes Lordſhips; The very
ſame did <hi>Salomon</hi> obſerue in his
time, in the great Burgomaſters
of Ieruſalem <hi>Pro. 13. 7.</hi> For the
auoyding of both extremes, let
vs inquire who is rich. And tho
greatnes and riches be in the
ranke of thoſe things, which are
held to haue no abſolute deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
but conſiſt rather in
reſpect &amp; compariſon (for a rich
Farmer is yet poore to a rich
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:27762:16"/>
Merchant, and a rich Merchant
is but poore to a Prince, and he
to ſome great Emperor; That
great Mammoniſt would ſay
he is rich that can maintaine an
Armie, a poore man would ſay
according to that Italian inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
He is rich that wants not
bread); Yet certainly there are
certaine generall ſtakes and
bounds, which diuide betwixt
pouerty and competence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
competency and wealth;
As there were variety of ſhekels
among the Iewes, yet there was
one ſhekell of the Sanctuarie
that varied not; Who then is
rich? I muſt giue you a double
anſwer; One will not ſerue; The
one according to true moralitie,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:27762:16"/>
the other according to vulgar
vſe: In the firſt he is rich that
hath enough, whether the world
thinke ſo or not; Euen <hi>Eſau</hi> tho
he were poore in grace, yet in
eſtate he was rich, <hi>I haue enough
my brother;</hi> And he that ſaid,
<hi>Soule thou haſt goods enow for many
yeares,</hi> was almoſt ſo; It was
not his fault that he thought he
had enough, but that he meant
to lye downe, and wallow in it.
A mans wealth or pouertie is
moſt-what in himſelfe; And
though nature haue profeſſed
to read vnto heathen men this
leſſon of wiſe moderation, yet it
hath beene ſeldome ſeene that
any thing but true piety, hath
taught them to take it out; <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:27762:17"/>
is great gaine with contentment:
Victus &amp; veſtitus diuitiae Chriſtiano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
ſaith <hi>Hierom:</hi> Food and
rayment are the Chriſtians
wealth; Thoſe men therefore,
which are ſtill in the horſe
leeches note, ſucking and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing;
which like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> leane
kine are euer feeding, and neuer
the fatter, are as farre from true
wealth, as they would be from
pouertie, and further I am ſure
they cannot be, and not further
from wealth then godlineſſe;
Hauing is the meaſure of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
wealth, but it is thinking
that muſt meaſure the inward;
thoughts, I ſay, of contentment,
cheerefullnes, and thankfulnes,
which if yee want, it is not either
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:27762:17"/>
or both the Indyes that can
make you rich.</p>
            <p>In the latter, he is rich that

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
neceſſarie, is ſuperfluous: There
is then a double neceſſarie; One
of nature, the other of eſtate:
That is neceſſarie to nature
without which we cannot liue,
that to eſtate, without which we
cannot liue well: That is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsarie
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:27762:18"/>
to eſtate, which were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
to nature; and that
which were ſuperfluous to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is not ſo much as neceſsary
to eſtate; Nature goes ſingle,
and beares litle breadth; Eſtate
goes euer with a traine; The
neceſſitie of nature admits litle
difference, eſpecially for quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
the neceſſitie of eſtate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
as many diuerſities, as
there are ſeuerall degrees of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
conditions, and ſeuerall
circumſtances in thoſe degrees.
Iuſtly therefore doe the Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Caſuiſts teach, that this
neceſsarie to the decencie of
eſtate doth not confiſt <hi>in puncto

That is neceſſarie to ſcarlet,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:27762:18"/>
which to ruſſet were ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;

neceſſitie looke onely to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,

muſt be, the mariage of a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the education of a ſonne,
the honeſt prouiſion for poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie:
He that in a iuſt eſtimate
can goe beyond the bounds of
this neceſsary, enters into the
ſuperfluous eſtate, and may
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:27762:19"/>
well paſſe with the world for
rich.</p>
            <p>Such a one is rich; let him
looke how he became ſo: That
God which can allow you to be
rich, will not allow you alwaies
to your wealth: He hath ſet vp
a golden goale, to which hee
allowes you all to runne, but
yee muſt keepe the beaten rode
of honeſtie, iuſtice, charity, and
truth; if yee will leaue this
path, and will be croſſing ouer
a ſhorter cut through by-wayes

with a vengeance. The heathen

If you haue filled your

this gaine may be hony in
your mouth, but it will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
in your throat, and poyſon
in your ſoule: There are ſome
meanes of wealth in an ill name,
as thoſe two truſty ſeruants of
Mammon, vſe and brocage;
there are others as bad as they,
litle ſaid to: Since I ſpeake to
Citizens, let mee be bold to ſay,
there is not ſo errand vſury in
letting of money, as in ſale of
wares. This oppreſſion is both
more, &amp; more vniuerſall. There
are two maximes that doe vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

thing is worth what it may be
ſold for; The other, <hi>Caueat em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptor,</hi>
At the buyers perill: The
one is in regard of the price, the
other in regard of the qualitie of
the wares. In the firſt, whereas
our Caſuiſts haue ſet three
prices, low, meane, rigorous,
they ſuper adde a fourth, exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue;
and thinke they may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
get what they can: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they ſhall once finde, that as
the rigorous price is a ſtraine of
charity, ſo the exceſſiue is a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of iuſtice; neither doth
this gaine differ ought from
theft, but that it is honeſted by a
faire cozenage. In the ſecond;
It matters not how defectiue the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:27762:20"/>
meaſure be, how vicious the
ſubſtance, how falſe the kinde,
let this be the buyers care; No
man is bound to buy, no man
can do wrong to himſelfe; Such
wares muſt be put off, (perhaps
not to cuſtomers) with conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of faults, if not with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations
of faultleſnes. In <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi>

apart, he boaſted;</hi> But now, <hi>It is

when the buyer is gone, he boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:27762:22"/>
done on a worldly heart; it is
both hard and cold; Let the
Smith ſtrike a barre new-come
out of the fire (though it be
yron) it bowes, let him ſtrike
on his anvile neuer ſo long,
there is no impreſſion, but rather
a rebound of the ſtroke: The
maker of all hearts tells vs, that
the vnregenerate man hath <hi>Cor
lapideum,</hi> an heart of ſtone, and
to what purpoſe do we with our
venerable Countryman preach
to an heape of ſtones? Will yee
haue the reaſon why we preach
our ſelues hoarſe and dead, and
preuaile not? The world is in
mens eares, the world is in their
hearts; and they are not <hi>in</hi> the
world, but of it; and there can
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:27762:23"/>
be nothing in them that are of
the world, but that which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
to God; and that which
God repayes with enmity, ſo as
there is no way for them but pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
with the world: It is
for thoſe onely whoſe hearts are
not in their bags, to receiue the
charge from God for their
wealth, and to returne glory to
him by it: To theſe (whereof I
hope here are many before mee)
muſt <hi>Timothies</hi> charge, and my
ſpeech be directed: Let theſe
heare their condition firſt, and
then their dutie: Their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>They are rich,</hi> but <hi>In this world;</hi>
For diſtinction, for limitation;
one implyes the eſtate of their
riches, the other the time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:27762:23"/>
Their eſtate, as learned <hi>Beza,</hi>
that they are but worldly riches.
The very word imports that
there are other riches, not of the
world; as <hi>Auſten</hi> diſtinguiſhes
of <hi>Pauper in animo,</hi> and <hi>in ſacculo;</hi>
poore in minde, and in purſe; ſo
may we of the rich: There is a
ſpirituall wealth, as well as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
and ſo true and precious
is the ſpirituall, that the ſecular
wealth is but ſtarke beggery to
it; This outward wealth is in
acres of earth, in the bowels of
the earth, the fruits of the earth,
beaſts of the earth; and all of it
is valued by peeces of earth, and
one mouth-full of earth makes
an end of all; Who knowes not
that Earth is the baſeſt peece of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:27762:24"/>
the world, and yet earth is at the
end of all theſe riches, and all of
them end in the earth: See
what it is that the world dotes
and dreames of (for theſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hopes, as the diuine Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
ſaid, are but dreames of the
waking) euen <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi>
image, a compoſition of met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
and the foote of all is clay.
Earthly men tread vpon their
felicitie, and yet haue not the
wit to contemne it and to ſeeke
a better, which is the ſpirituall
wealth; the cabinet whereof is
the ſoule, and the treaſure in it,
God himſelfe. Oh happy reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution

how ſhort ſoeuer, is the vtmoſt

a litle more land, or title

ſee it in his garbe; If he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
it is imperiouſly, with

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:27762:28"/>
it is ouerly, with a ſurly and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
nod; if he ſpeake, it is ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
if hee walke, it is with a
grace; if he controll, it is in the
killing accent; if he intertaine,
it is with inſolence, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
he doth, he is not as he was,
nor, as the Phariſee ſayes, like
other men. He looks vpon vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar

themſelues happy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
and if he be croſſed a

he cares more for an affront, then
for death, or hell; Let it by his

And alas when all is

this is but a man, and (God

whom a litle earthly traſh can
affect ſo deeply.</p>
            <p>Neither doth this pride raiſe a
man more aboue others, then
aboue himſelf; And what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

Now it may not be taken

Charity is not ſtrait-laced, but
yeelds much latitude to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

(although it is one of <hi>Salomons</hi>

O God, what a world of vanity

Pardon, I beſeech you, men, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,

Imagine one of our fore-fathers

him; what doe you thinke hee

nothing to be ſeene but a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingale,
a yellow ruffe, and a
periwig, with perhaps ſome fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wauing in the top; three
things for which he could not
tell how to finde a name: Sure,
he could not but ſtand amazed
to thinke what new creature the
times had yeelded ſince he was
a man: And if then he ſhould
runne before her, to ſee if by the
fore-ſide he might gueſſe what
it were, when his eyes ſhould
meet with a poudred firzle, a
painted hide ſhadowed with a
fan not more painted, breſts
diſplayd, and a looſe lock erring
wantonly ouer her ſhoulders,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:27762:31"/>
betwixt a painted cloth, and
skin, how would he yet more
bleſſe himſelfe to thinke, what
mixture in nature could be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

(thinks he) the fleſh and blood,
is this the hayre, is this the ſhape
of a woman? or hath nature
repented of her worke ſince my
daies, and begun a new frame?
It is no maruell if their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
could not know them;
God himſelfe that made them,
will neuer acknowledge that
face he neuer made, the hayre
that he neuer made theirs, the
body that is aſham'd of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
the ſoule that thus diſguiſes
the body; Let me therefore ſay
to theſe Dames, as <hi>Benet</hi> ſaid
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:27762:31"/>
to <hi>Totilaes</hi> ſeruant, <hi>Depone filia
quod portas, quia non est tuum;</hi> Lay
downe that yee weare, it is none

them (for that can worke moſt)
that they do all this in their own
wrong: All the world knowes
that no man will rough caſt a
marble wall, but mud, or vnpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht
ragge: That beauty is like
truth, neuer ſo glorious, as when
it goes plaineſt; that falſe art in

it: But if none of our perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
can preuaile; Heare this

Heare this, yee plaiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
<hi>Iezebels,</hi> if you will not
leaue your dawbing and your
hye waſhes, God ſhall one day
waſh them off with fire and

            <p>I grant, it is not wealth alone
that is acceſſary to this pride;
there are ſome that (with the
Cynick, or that worſe dog, the
patch't Ciſtertian) are proud of
raggs; there are others, that are
rich of nothing but clothes,
ſomewhat like to <hi>Nazianzens</hi>
country of <hi>Ozizala,</hi> that aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in flowers, but was barren
of corne; Their clothes are
more worth then all the reſt; as
we vſe to ſay of the Elder, that
the flower of it, is more worth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:27762:32"/>
then all the tree beſides; but if
there be any other cauſes of our
hye-mindedneſſe, wealth is one,
which doth ordinarily lift vp
our heads, aboue our ſelues,
aboue others; and if there be
here any of theſe empty blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
that are pufft vp with the
winde of conceit, giue me leaue
to pricke them a litle; and firſt,
let me tell them they may haue
much, and be neuer the better;

a man wealth for their greater

was ſuch, that famine had been
better; litle cauſe had they to be
proud that they were fed with
meat of Princes, with the bread
of Angels, whiles that which
they put into their mouthes,
God fetcht out of their noſthrils.
<hi>Haman</hi> was proud that he alone
was called to the honor of <hi>Eſters</hi>
feaſt, this advancement rayſd
him fifty cubits hyer, to a ſtately

had neuer God appearing to
him, ſaue onely to bid him goe
forth, but after, when hee was

in our cofers, we cannot
haue the comfortable aſſurances
of the preſence of God; but if
we can abandon the loue and
truſt of theſe earthly things, in
the conſcience of our obedience,
now God ſhall appeare to vs,
and ſpeake peace to our ſoules;
and neuer ſhall we finde cauſe to
repent vs of the change. Let me
therefore conclude this point
with that diuine charge of our
Sauiour, <hi>Lay not vp for your ſelues
treaſures on earth, where mothe and
rust doe corrupt, and theeues breake
thorough and ſteale, but lay vp for
your ſelues treaſure in heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much of the negatiue
part of our charge; Wherein we
haue dwelt ſo long, that we may

ſcarce ſoiourne in the other.
<hi>Truſt not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">But (truſt) in God.</note> but <hi>Truſt;</hi> The heart

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:27762:43"/>
which which we may not giue

changed, the act is not changed.
Him muſt we eſteeme aboue all

Good, in reſpect of him, and

All other things hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts

in our not Truſting him, in
taking vengeance of vs for not

He is, he liues; and nothing is,
nothing liues abſolutely, but he;
all other things by participation
from him. In all other things,
their life and they are two; but
God is his owne life, and the life
of God is no other then the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
God: And becauſe he is
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:27762:48"/>
his owne life, he is eternall; for
(as <hi>Thomas</hi> argues truely againſt
the Gentiles) Nothing ceaſes to
be but by a ſeparation of life, and
nothing can be ſeparated from
it ſelfe; for euery ſeparation is
a diuiſion of one thing from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
Moſt iuſtly therefore is
he which is abſolute, ſimple, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
in his being, called the
<hi>liuing God:</hi> Although, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the life that he hath in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
but the life that he giues to
his creatures challengeth a part
in this title; A glimpſe whereof
perhaps the Heathen ſaw, when
they call'd their Iupiter, (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)
from (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) which ſignifies to
liue: <hi>In him we liue</hi> (ſaith <hi>S. Paul</hi>
to his Athenians). As light is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:27762:49"/>
from the Sunne, ſo is life from
God, (which is the true ſoule of
the world, and more; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him it could not be ſo much
as a carcaſſe; and ſpreads it ſelfe
into all the animate creatures.
Life (we ſay) is ſweet; and ſo it is
indeed; the moſt excellent and
precious thing that is deriued
from the common influence of
God. There is nothing before
life, but Being; and Being makes
no diſtinction of things; for that
can be nothing, that hath no
Being; Life makes the firſt and
greateſt diuiſion; Thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
therefore, which haue life,
we eſteeme farre beyond thoſe,
that haue it not, how noble ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
otherwiſe; Thoſe things
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:27762:49"/>
therefore which haue the perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
life muſt needs be the beſt;
Needs then muſt it follow that
he which is life it ſelfe, who is
abſolute, ſimple, eternall, the
fountaine of all that life which
is in the world, is moſt worthy
of all the adoration, ioy, loue,
and confidence of our hearts,
and of the beſt improuement of
that life which he hath giuen vs.
Truſt therefore in the liuing
GOD. Couetouſnes (the ſpirit
of God tells vs) is Idolatry, or (as
our old Tranſlation turnes it)
worſhipping of Images. Euery
ſtampe or impreſſion in his
coyne is to the couetous man a
very Idoll; And what madnes
is there in this Idolatry, to dote
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:27762:50"/>
vpon a baſe creature, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
that life which wee haue
from God, vpon a creature that
hath no life in it ſelfe, and no
price but from men: Let mee
then perſwade euery ſoule that
heares me this day, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did
his houſhold, <hi>Put away the ſtrange
Gods that are among you,</hi>

and all this, not to looke on, but

the more wee may ſay of this
head, the leſſe we will ſay: It

            <p>Whither can yee turne your

If downeward; The earth

Laſtly, if yee looke into your

that ſoule. Vnderſtanding,
the great ſurvayer of the ſecrets
of nature, and grace; Fantaſie
and Invention the maſter of the

keeper or Maſter of the rolles of
the ſoule, a power that can
make amends for the ſpeede of
Time, in cauſing him to leaue
behinde him thoſe things, which
elſe he would ſo carry away, as
if they had not beene: Will,
which is the Lord Paramount in
the ſtate of the ſoule, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of our actions; the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of our reſolutions. Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which is the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor
of the will: Affections,
which are the ſeruants of them
both. A bodie fit to execute the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:27762:52"/>
charge of the ſoule, ſo wondrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly
diſpoſed, as that euery part
hath beſt oportunitie to his own
functions; ſo qualified with
health ariſing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proportion of
humors that like a watch kept in
good tune it goes right, and is fit
to ſerue the ſoule, &amp; maintaine it
ſelfe. An eſtate that yeelds all due
conueniences for both ſoule, and
bodie; ſeaſonable times, raine, &amp;
ſun-ſhine; Peace in our borders;
competency, if not plenty of all
commodities, good lawes, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
wiſe, iuſt gouernors, happy
and flouriſhing daies, and aboue
all the liberty of the Goſpel. Caſt
vp your bookes, ô ye Citizens, &amp;
ſum vp your receits, I am decei'd
if he that hath leaſt ſhall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:27762:52"/>
his obligations infinite.
There are three things eſpecially
wherein yee are beyond others,
and muſt acknowledge your
ſelues deeper in the bookes of
God, then the reſt of the world;
Let the firſt be the cleare deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from that wofull iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Peſtilence. Oh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
thoſe ſorrowfull times,<note place="margin">Aboue 30000 in one yeare.</note>
when euery moneth ſwept away
thouſands from among you;
When a man could not ſet forth
his foote but into the iawes of
death; when piles of carcaſſes
were carried to their pits as dung
to the fields; when it was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
in the ſicke to admit viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and loue was litle better
then murderous; And by how
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:27762:53"/>
much more ſad and horrible the
face of thoſe euill times looked,
ſo much greater proclaime you
the mercy of God, in this happy
freedom which you now inioy;
that you now throng together
into Gods houſe without feare,
and breath in one anothers face
without danger: The ſecond is
the wonderfull plenty of all
prouiſions both ſpirituall and
bodily; You are the Sea, all the
riuers of the land run into you;
Of the land? yea of the whole
world, Sea and land conſpire to
inrich you. The third is the
priuiledge of carefull gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
Your charters as they are
large and ſtrong, wherein the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of Princes hath made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:27762:53"/>
from the generall rules
of their municipall lawes, ſo
your forme of adminiſtration is
excellent, and the execution of
Iuſtice exemplary, and ſuch as
might become the mother Citie
of the whole earth. For all
theſe you haue reaſon to aske,
<hi>Quid retribuam</hi> with <hi>Dauid; What
ſhall I render to the Lord for all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits?</hi>
and to excite one another
vnto thankfulneſſe with that
ſweet ſinger of Iſrael, <hi>Oh that men
would therefore praiſe the Lord for his
goodneſſe:</hi> and (as beneficence is
a binder) theſe fauors of God
call for your confidence: What
ſhould you do but euer truſt that
God, whom you haue found ſo
gracious? Let him be your God,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:27762:54"/>
be yee his people for euer; and
let him make this free and open
challenge to you all; If there be
any power in heauen, or in earth
that can doe more for you then
he hath done let him haue your
hearts and yourſelues.</p>
            <p>And thus from that dutie we
owe to God in our confidence,
and his beneficence to vs, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
to that beneficence which
we owe to men; expreſſed in the
variety of foure Epithets, <hi>Doing
good,</hi>
               <note place="margin">That they doe good, and bee rich in good works.</note> 
               <hi>being rich in good workes, ready
to diſtribute, willing to communicate;</hi>
all to one ſenſe; all is but benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence:
The ſcriptures of God
leaſt any Atheiſt ſhould quarrell
at this waſte, haue not one word
ſuperfluous; Here is a redoubling
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:27762:54"/>
of the ſame words without
fault of Tautologie; a redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of the ſame ſenſe in diuers
words, without idlenes. There is
feruor in theſe repetitions, not
looſenes; as it was wont for this
cauſe to bee obſerued both in
Councels, and acclamations to
Princes, how oft the ſame word
was reiterated, that by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
they might iudge of the
vehemence of affection. It were
eaſie to inſtance in many of this
kinde, as eſpecially <hi>Exod. 25. 35.
Pſal. 89. 30. Ioh. 1. 20.</hi> and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more, as that their mention
could not be voide of that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie
which we diſclaime. This
heape of words therfore ſhowes
the vehement intention of his
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:27762:55"/>
deſire of good workes, and the
important neceſſitie of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance;
and the manner of
this expreſſion inforces no leſſe,
<hi>Charge the rich, that they do good, and
be rich in doing good.</hi> Harken then
yee rich men of the world; it is
not left arbitrary to you, that
you may doe good if you will,
but it is laid vpon you as your
charge and dutie; You muſt do
good works, and woe be to you
if you doe not. This is not a
counſell, but a precept; Although
I might ſay of God, as we vſe to
ſay of Princes, his will is his
command; The ſame neceſſitie
that there is of Truſting in God,
the ſame is in <hi>Doing good</hi> to men.
Let me ſling this ſtone into the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:27762:55"/>
brazen forheads of our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which in their ſhameleſſe
challenges of our religion dare
tell the world, wee are all for
faith, nothing for works; and
that we hold works to ſaluation
as a parentheſis to a clauſe, that
it may be perfit without them:
Heauen and earth ſhall witneſſe
the iniuſtice of this calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and your conſciences
ſhall be our compurgators this
day, which ſhall teſtifie to you,
both now, and on your death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds,
that we haue taught you
there is no leſſe neceſſitie of
good works, then if you ſhould
be ſau'd by them; and that
though you cannot be ſaued by
them, as the meritorious cauſes
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:27762:56"/>
of your glory, yet that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſaued without them, as
the neceſſarie effects of that
grace which brings glory.</p>
            <p>It is an hard ſentence of ſome
Caſuiſts (concerning their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes)
that but a few rich mens
Confeſſors ſhall be ſaued; I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
for that they dawbe vp
their conſciences with vntem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
morter, and ſooth them vp
in their ſins; Let this be the care
of them whom it concerneth;
For vs, we deſire to be faithfull
to God, and you; and tell you
roundly what you muſt truſt to;
Do good therefore yee rich, if
euer yee looke to receiue good;
if euer yee looke to be rich in
heauen, be rich in good works
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:27762:56"/>
vpon earth: It is a ſhame to
heare of a rich man that dyes,
and makes his will of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,
and bequeaths nothing to
pious and charitable vſes: God
and the poore are no part of his
heyre; We doe not houer ouer
your expiring ſoules on your
death-beds, as Rauens ouer a
carcaſſe; we doe not begge for
a Couent, nor fright you with
Purgatory, nor chaffer with
you, for that inviſible treaſure of
the Church whereof there is but
one Key-keeper at Rome; but
we tell you that the making of
freinds with this Mammon of
vnrighteouſnes is the way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
habitations: They ſay
of <hi>Cyrus</hi> that he wont to ſay he
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:27762:57"/>
laid vp treaſures for himſelfe,
whiles he made his freinds rich;
but we ſay to you, that you lay
vp treaſures for your ſelues in
heauen, whiles you make the
poore your freinds vpon earth:
We tell you there muſt be a <hi>Date,</hi>
ere there can be a <hi>Dabitur;</hi> that
hee which giues to the poore,
lends vpon vſe to the Lord;
which payes large increaſe for
all he borrowes; and how ſhall
he giue you the intereſt of glory,
where he hath not receiued the
principall of beneficence? How
can that man euer looke to be
Gods heyre in the kingdome of
heauen, that giues all away to
his earthly heyres, and lends no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the God of heauen?
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:27762:57"/>
As that witty Graecian ſaid of
extreme tall men, that they were
Cypreſſe-trees <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp;c. faire
and tall, but fruitleſſe, ſo may I
ſay of a ſtrait-handed rich man;
And theſe Cypreſſes are not for
the garden of paradiſe; none
ſhall euer be planted there but
the fruitfull: And if the firſt
paradiſe had any trees in it only
for pleaſure, I am ſure the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,<note place="margin">Reuel. 22. 2.</note>
which is in the midſt of
the new Ieruſalem, ſhall haue no
tree that beares not twelue fruits,
yea whoſe very leaues are not
beneficiall; Doe good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ô yee rich, and ſhew your
wealth to be, not in hauing, but
in doing good. And if GOD
haue put this holy reſolution
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:27762:58"/>
into any of your hearts, take this
with you alſo, from him; Doe
not talke, and purpoſe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
but execute; Do not ſo do
good that we may thanke your
death-bed for it, and not you:
Late beneficence is better then
none, but ſo much as early bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
is better then late; Hee
that giues not till hee dyes,
ſhowes that he would not giue,
if he could keepe it, and God
loues a cheerefull giuer; That
which you giue thus, you giue it
by your Teſtament, I can ſcarce
ſay you giue it by your will:
The good mans praiſe is, <hi>Diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit,
dedit, he diſperſes his goods,</hi> not,
he left them behinde him; and
his diſtribution is ſeconded
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:27762:58"/>
with the retribution of God,
<hi>His righteouſneſſe endureth for euer,
Pſal. 112. 9.</hi> Our Sauiour tells
vs that our good works are our
light, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine, that
men may ſee your good works;</hi> which
of you lets his light goe behind
him, and hath it not rather car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
before him, that he may ſee
which way it goes, and which
way himſelf goes by it? Do good
therefore in your life, that you
may haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort in your death,
and a crowne of life after death.</p>
            <p>Now all this haue I ſpoken,
not for that I haue ought (as
<hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaies) whereof to accuſe
my Nation; Bleſſed be God, as
good works haue abounded in
this age, ſo this place hath ſuper-abounded
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:27762:59"/>
in good works. Be
it ſpoken to the glory of that
God, whoſe all our good works
are, to the honor of the Goſpell,
to the conviction of that lewd
ſlander of Solifidianiſme. LON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DON

day and your eares are abundant
witneſſes; As thoſe therefore
that by an handfull gueſſe at the

Thoſe obſtreperous benefactors
that (like to hens which cannot
lay an egge but they muſt cackle
ſtraight) giue no almes but with

trumpets, looſe their thankes
with God; Almes ſhould bee
like oyle, which though it ſwim
aloft when it is fallne, yet makes
no noyſe in the falling; not like
water, that ſtill ſounds where it
lights: But howſoeuer priuate
beneficence ſhould not bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted

of the giuer, but ſilently expect
the reward of him that ſeeth in
ſecret, yet God ſhould be a great
looſer, if the publique fruits of
charitie ſhould be ſmothered in

therefore of that good GOD,
which giues vs to giue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
