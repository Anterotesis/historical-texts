            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A BRIEF ANSWER UNTO THE <hi>CAMBRIDGE</hi> MODDEL. VVhich is to go to the two Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be read by all the Doctors and Students, Vice-Chancellor, and Fellows, as they will answer it to GOD. And likewise this is to go to all those they call Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Countreys to whom this Moddel is directed, from the DOCTORS, for money to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the STUDENTS. And is to go amongst all the Priests that are, and have been heretofore made Ministers by the same Doctors of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, now planted themselves in the Countreys. And this is to go amongst all the Country-men, that they may see the fruits of the Learning from these Doctors, which Fruits is PERSECUTION. And also that they and all people might come to learn of Christ the Prophet, which is raised up, which doth <hi>enlighten every man which comes into the world,</hi> high and low, rich and poor, Bond and free, Male and Female, that all through him might believe, who is the Covenant of God, the leader of the people, whom they should hear, who reconciles in one, things in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and things on earth, who brings into Unity, which is in the light which every man which comes into the world is light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned withal, which is Christ, that <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Prophets, and <hi>Moses</hi> spake of, he being enjoyed, the end is seen.

            <p>OH shame! Cover your faces, you chief Doctors and Teachers; was this the work of the Apostles? and is this the end of your so many thousands of pounds a a year you have out of the Nation? and hundred pounds a year stipends? Doth not your gold and silver begin to burn in your flesh and your bones? Hath it not cankered your flesh yet? Is it not rusted in your flesh yet? Will you make Ministers and young Students for money? Did the Apostles go begging up and down to Gentlemen (as you call them) for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to make Students, to make Ministers? Did Christ set forth such a way? Now this is the way to make Ministers of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who are persecutors of the Ministers of the Spirit, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, &amp; the people of God: and you are more for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and they both, when you have made them, then for the glory of God; and you are quite out of the steps of them that Christ sent forth, that what was set before them they might eat: And the foundation of your work lyes in your naturall parts, and in your abilities, buying and selling Parishes, and begging Parishes, and changing one from another. Nay, I know you Priests, Black-coats, and Doctors, would eat up one another, who are the worst of men, and the worst of flesh, which
<pb facs="tcp:93174:2"/>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:93174:3"/>
is become as the carrion, fit for nothing but the wilde Beasts, and wilde Creatures, and Fowls, and your fruits in all the Gaols in the Nation, of the Ministers you have made, declares it, in prisoning, and the Courts suing and prisoning them, you do no work for; a shamelesse company of men, they are so ill bred at <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> such a place of ill breeding, that you bring a Nation and People into confusion: But prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be the Lord God you are all measured, and comprehended, unlike the Ministers of the Gospel, unlike the Church; but your hearts (appears) are seared with a hot iron, when you have made your Ministers, both maker, and made destroy people for dishonest gain, who pretend to people that you are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ, and be not, which comes out of the two drosse houses, <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and sends forth your Ministers you have made, makes a trade of the Scriptures, and sells their preaching and praying by the hour-glasse, and tells the people when the glasse is run, the time is spent. Doth not all the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber people in the Nation behold here your folly? and you sing <hi>Davids</hi> quaking, and Prayers, and Praises, and prophecies for money? For what Priest will come in the <hi>Steeple-house,</hi> and sing without money? Away with your abominations, is this your <hi>Moddell</hi> for money? Come sing freely, and praise the Lord freely, yea all Nations to the free God of heaven and earth: <hi>and preach freely, if yee have received freely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then scrubs the Priest, and saith, <hi>It hath cost me money,</hi> and murmurs; Come pray freely without money for the people to the Lord, then he will hear your prayers without your wrath, for your polluted hands is so full of blood and persecution for your bellies, as your Courts and Gaols may witnesse, and hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Correction, and stocks, and whipping posts, for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord God: <hi>But I will arise and be eased of mine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries saith the Lord.</hi> And you are far off the Mount and <hi>Sions</hi> Hill, who are thus choaked up with Stipends and Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Gleab Lands, <hi>Midsomer</hi> dues, and <hi>Easter</hi> reckonings, and tythe Pigs and Geese, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> gifts and rewards, and hands so full of blood, persecution, wrath and doubting of ever overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sin and imperfection. For what good (when you have made them Ministers by money, and send them forth to preach for money) what good do they do for it? you tell your hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93174:3"/>
they shall never be made free from the body of sin, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, they shall always carry the body of sin about them, while they are upon earth, and that they can never be perfect, so denies the new Covenant that blots out sin and transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in which men have peace with God. You deny <hi>the blood of Jesus Christ which cleanseth from all sinne.</hi> You deny the one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering <hi>Christ Jesus, who hath perfected for ever them that are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified:</hi> And so in this state you deny Christ that died at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and so you are in a worse state then the first Priest hood, which the comers to it was not made perfect, and the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and so you are such as are crept into houses, <hi>and have the forme of godlinesse, but denies the power,</hi> and keeps people <hi>alwayes learning, laden with sin and divers lusts, never able to come to the knowledge of truth,</hi> like unto <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> that would have kept the children of <hi>Israel</hi> in temporal <hi>AEgypt,</hi> and so you keep them in spirituall <hi>AEgypt, Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> where Christ is crucified, though it be in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and you voluptuous Professors and Teachers, and called Ministers, and makers of them, consider this, for the fire of the jealousie of the Almighty is entring into your bones, and your flesh, and the dread of the Lord God Almighty will finde you out. Take counsel never so much together against the Lords annointed, &amp; the just, he will break you to pieces like potters vessells: And light will break forth, though you be in never such great houses of darknesse, though you swell like the Sea, and rage like the waves, and yell like the Lyons, who want their prey, and roar like the Bear bereaved of her whelps, and raven like Wolves, and carry the Lambs and Sheep into houses of Correction for your prey, because you cannot get meat of them, whom the Lord is their Shepherd, who follows Christ, and hears his voyce; who hath put his sheep forth from you to whom he hath given eternall life. Though you roar in your Pulpits, and make the ignorant people like a raging sea, all of a fire against the Lambs and little ones, the Lord will still the waves and lay the tempests, and hath put the hook in the jaws of the great <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan</hi> in the Sea. Come ye Babes and little ones, and rejoyce over them in the Lord, who is causing light to break forth out of darkness.</p>
            <p>The two places, <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which makes Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93174:4"/>
the things which is seen concerning them is, they are like two Woods, full of black trees, which are blackned with smoke, and a few leaves hangs dropping on the Tops of them, like unto trees at the fall of the leaf, and they stand as it were in a quagmire, which is made up with the fat of the Nation, and the exacting of poor people, and wringing of them, like a great heap of myery soft earth, and when the wind blows the quagmire puffs at the bottom of it, and there is but little mosse growes on the trees, because of the smoke, and these trees bears no fruit, but a few dropping leaves as it were in the end of Summer, so they stand as the shaking off with a great winde, whose leaf fades, and so as they are carried out of that quag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and wood and banke, undressed, they are planted in the Countries like starved trees in the Forest, beaten with windes and weathers, dried with bark on, and some Mosse on them, and scarce leaves. Now these be the fuel for the fire, which cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers the ground, fruitlesse trees, and the Nations and the earth hath layen like a Wildernesse, and these trees have not born fruit, and their leaves fades and falls; And the fruitfull trees of the field begins to clap their hands who beares the fruit, whose leaf never fades nor falls, that is by the River, and the smoak of these two woods before mentioned hath almost smoaked off the barks of them, for they have scarcely the outside of them nor leaves, but they are droping down continually, and they must all drop off and appear bare, for they have not any to cover them, and all your works and the intent of your <hi>Moddel,</hi> is to get money that you might make Ministers, are you like the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in this? have you thrust out Christ, and denyed the faith, will you let Christ have no Room, but in your mouths to talk of him? had ever Christ any place but in the manger amongst the Professors, &amp; them that lived in lip service, their hearts far off from God? had not the great professors <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> in the dayes of old, the great Talkers of Christ? and he had no place amongst them but in the manger in the stable, are not you making Ministers, and begging money of the Gentry, and frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their evil consciences if they will not give it you? and the highest when you have made them is but <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin;</hi> which is but natural, and so is but a natural man, <hi>and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man receives not the things of God though he hath Hebrew,</hi>

               <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> though he can talk of all Scripture in those lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and will put Christ in the stable and in the manger, and let him have no Room in the Synagogues as the <hi>Jewes</hi> would not, but was all full of wrath, and rose up against him, and put him out of the Synagogue; and do not you &amp; your Ministers put him out of your Synagogues, and put him in prison? is not this the fruits of your Ministers, and your makers of them? sure people will be wise, and <hi>not spend their money for that which is not bread;</hi> where was there such degrees amongst the Apostles as is amongst you and the <hi>Papists, Batchelors</hi> and <hi>Masters of Arts,</hi> and so forth? and where did the Apostle chuse boyes, out of Schools, and send them to a place to learn <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> 7 or 8 years, and that such should be made Ministers, is not this by men and of men? doth not all this come out of your own names? let the wise in heart judge; so if one come in his own name, the world receives him, but who comes in the name of the Lord the world will not receive him.</p>
            <p>And whereas you say <hi>some have been but four yeares at the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, they are through poverty forced to go away, to enter into the Ministry while they are raw, which should have stayed four years more, having been provided for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are you not ashamed, doth money make your Ministers? was it not money that made all the false Prophets and the selfish ends? how are you like Ravens, and the Lilies, and the grasse, are you not all comprehended here amongst the Heathen? and your rawness both Ministers and Makers hath sufficiently appeared, and declared it selfe to the whole Nation, and when you have made them at 8 yeares standing and 7 and 4, and has gotten all his learning, <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> and other Languages which the Gentry of the Country must maintain them, and poor people besides, when he hath gotten all his carnal weapons, and armed himself with them, and got up into his steeple-house, one of them, the poor dispised people, a woman, a lad, or a girle, come and but look this Priest in the face, as he is in his pulpit with all his <hi>Goliahs</hi> weapons, carnal languages, he falls before them, him or her the said <hi>Quaker,</hi> and cryes <hi>take them away, they disturb me, to the house of correction with them, to the Prison;</hi> and thus the Student and Minister shames both Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

This is like unto them that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> cries out against, that <hi>run when the Lord never sent them,</hi> that are using their tongues, and speak when the Lord never spoke to them, and these are them that runs from you Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; And them that be friends of Christ and of the Gospel, and love their Countrey, the souls and good of people, will see that you have not the bread to feed the hungry, and you do not bind up, but you make rents, and you do not visit in prison, but you cast into prison them that will not put into your mouths; and you do not bring people from under the law, but bring people under the law into Courts, and Sessions, and Assizes, and you cast them into prison for tythes, and tenths, and so you are unlike the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Gospel, which brought people out of ninths and tenths both, redeemed out of the earth up to God, but you are gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Papists, inwardly ravenous, into the earth, and there sets up tenths, and keeps people in the ninths of the earth, unlike the Ministers of the Gospel, which is the power of God, which opens the hearts of the people, whereby they come out of the ninths and tenths both, to Christ, who redeems out of the earth to God, whereby they come to reign upon the earth. Doth the tenths serve all the widows, fatherlesse, and strangers, and the Priest? Doth it give them all enough? Now man transgressing, and being drove from God into the earth, <hi>Abraham</hi> before the Law paid the tenths of the spoile to <hi>Melchisedech</hi> King of Righteousness, in the Law of the Lord, required the tenths of the earth, and he made these tenths to serve widows, fatherlesse, strangers, and <hi>Levi,</hi> that there might not be a beggar amongst them. Now Christ the end of the Law, and of Wars, the Redeemer and the Saviour out of the earth, brings from out of the ninths and tenths, and so comes to reign upon the earth, and these are of the royal Priesthood, and the family of the faithful, which was of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of which Christ came according to the flesh, which lives out of ninths and tenths both of the earth up to God, whose the earth is. Now apostatized Papists and sects since the dayes of the Apostles, &amp; false Prophets, and Antichrist that had the <hi>sheeps cloathing,</hi> that ravened from the spirit of God into the earth, drew the world after them, set up ninths and tenths: so they get tenths of the earth, and keep peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

Oh! how unlike the Ministers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel are you, that brought people out of the ninth and tenth both to God to reign a top of it, glory to the highest: And such brought back that which was driven away; but you that keeps in the ninths and tenths, keeps people under the curse, there to labour for you in the sweat of their brows, toyling and tugging for you in the transgression: But some are redeemed from you, and cannot put into your mouths, and such you have your dens for, you that be in the transgression, that be under the curse, and keep people under the curse with ninths and tenths of the earth, which now many is coming out of: and woe will be your portion and misery, and all them that be come into the life of the Prophets of Christ.</p>
            <p>Now it is not their work to put in the mouths of the false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but they that did so was the ignorant and foolish people, and foolish Gentry of the countrey, which they were deceived by; and the <hi>Saints</hi> know that the love of the <hi>false Prophets</hi> was all after money, and themselves and such blinds the eye of the mind of many both great and small, and they are them that cries <hi>give, give, and they that will not put into their mouths, they prepare war against them:</hi> And you wrest many Scriptures which is spoken of for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the poor, for your own ends, which poor it is manifest you do not regard, therefore is there so many widows and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlesse begging abroad in your streets, and at your <hi>Steeple-houses,</hi> and at your doors, and cast so many widows and poor men into prison that have many children, because they cannot give you tythes, and put into your mouths.</p>
            <p>And whereas you say in the ninth page, <hi>He is likest to God that doth good,</hi> you shew your selves the most unlike to God, as the Courts, Gaols, Prisons, and houses of <hi>Correction</hi> witnesse, and death, persecuting till death; so shews you your selves are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate concerning the faith, and the Ministers of Christ, and hath not learned the lesson of Christ, to learn mercy and not sacrifice, for your sacrifice is <hi>Cains,</hi> for you kill and murther, and are in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying your brethren, and so you have forgotten to do good, and so lost the blessing, and lost the savour of rest where the mercy is, which is to shew mercy; but you will give people Sermons, and pray, and sing to them, and tell them letter is light, and <hi>Matthew, Marke, Luke, &amp; John</hi> is the Gospel, and <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> is the Originall, and Letter is the Word, and it is the ground
