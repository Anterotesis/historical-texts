            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BY a ſad Providence you are brought together into this place, yea by a long ſeries of Providences the Governor of the World hath brought it to paſs, That I muſt be your Orator for a while, and you my Auditors.</p>
            <p>To beſpeak your attention and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, being met upon ſuch a ſad oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, one would think ſhould be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
            <p>I hope you are perſwaded that you
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35693:5"/>
are all here before God to whom all things are naked, and opened, and to whom you muſt, another day, give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of your being here this day.</p>
            <p>I hope alſo that you are fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that preaching the Goſpel, what ever the World accounts it, is the power of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16. and that whereby it pleaſeth him to ſave them that believe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18, 21. and that Faith comes by hearing it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. and that 'tis a means ordained of God to open peoples eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, <hi>&amp;c. Acts</hi> 26. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>I would hope alſo, that you are come with an expectation to hear what God, by Man, will ſay unto you, and with a reſolution to do what ſhall be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you of the Lord, as <hi>Peters</hi> Hearers, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 33. when he was ſent to them to tell them words whereby they might be ſaved, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 14.</p>
            <p>My hearts deſire and prayer to God is, that I may ſo ſpeak, and you may ſo hear, that our Souls may be, when we go hence, where that Bleſſed Soul is, whoſe Corps we are met here to inter.</p>

It is written, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 14. thus, <hi>Wherefore (Beloved) ſeeing that ye look for ſuch things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without ſpot and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</hi>

            <p>The day of the Lord will come, <hi>v.</hi> 10. whatever Mockers <hi>(v.</hi> 3, 4.) ſay to the contrary. Therefore the Apoſtle exhorts to holineſs, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and in this <hi>v.</hi> 14. repeats his Exhortation.</p>

            <p n="1">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:35693:7"/>
1. That you would ſettle this Truth in your hearts by believing it: Do not only ſay you believe it, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt ſhall come to judge the quick and the dead, but do ſo indeed, believe it with all your heart. My hearts deſire and prayer to God for you is, that you may be eſtabliſhed, ſtrengthned, and ſetled in the belief of this Article of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That you would be mindful of it, let it be always in your thoughts, Chriſt will come to Judgment, he will reckon for this another day. Say this often to your ſelves; <hi>The coming of the Lord draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nigh, he is even at the door,</hi> Jam. 5. 8, 9.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That you would repent: <hi>Becauſe for certain God hath appointed a day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he will judge the world by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Acts 17. 31.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That you would ſee to it, that your converſations be holy and godly. <hi>Seeing Chriſt will come to judgment, what manner of perſons ought we to be in all holy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and godlineſs?</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Believers at the coming of

Chriſt expect a bleſſed eſtate.</p>

            <p n="1">1. What this Peace and Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God is?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis the reſtoring that ancient friendſhip betwixt God and Man which ſin had diſſolved. Or,</p>
            <p>The reuniting of God and Man which were at odds.</p>
            <p>The healing and making up of the breach between God and Man, which ſin had made.</p>
            <p>Rightly to underſtand this, know,</p>
            <p n="1">1. God and Man were once good Friends; Man in his eſtate of innocency was in an eſtate of unity and amity with God, God was well pleaſed with Man, and Man well pleaſed with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 31.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By mans tranſgreſſion this friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35693:9"/>
eſtate between God and Man was loſt, and all mankind plunged into an eſtate of alienation and averſation from God, and enmity againſt God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This alienation and difference is mutual, on both ſides.</p>
            <p n="1">1. On Mans. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>You that were ſometimes alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. <hi>The carnal mind is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt God, and is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. On Gods. God owns him not, will have no fellowſhip with him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 23. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 17..</p>
            <p>God is ſo alienated from fallen Man,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he abominates his Perſon and Services.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His Perſon. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>The fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in thy ſight, thou hatest all workers of iniquity,</hi> ſaith <hi>David. God is angry with the wicked every day,</hi> Pſ. 7. 11. <hi>His Soul hateth the wicked,</hi> Pſ. 11. 5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His Services. <hi>He that turneth away his ear from hearing the Law, even his Prayer ſhall be abomination,</hi> Prov. 28. 9.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35693:9"/>
               <hi>The Sacrifice of the wicked is an abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 15. 8. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Incenſe is an abomination to me, your appointed Feaſts my Soul hateth.</hi> v. 14. <hi>They are a trouble to me, I am weary to bear them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. God is ſo alienated from man, that he leaves him under the power of Satan, to whom he had yielded himſelf, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And in bondage unto death under which he had brought himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God is ſo alienated from him, that he leaves him under the power of ſin which he had embraced, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16, 17.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Under the guilt of ſin which he had contracted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Under the curſe of the Law which he had tranſgreſſed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10, 13.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Under the wrath of God which he had deſerved, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18. and 5. 9.</p>
            <p n="4">4. No man can reconcile himſelf to God, or reingratiate himſelf with God, nor can any creature do it for him. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. Neither ſalvation, nor reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in any other but in Chriſt; for there is none other name under Heaven
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35693:10"/>
among men, whereby we muſt be ſaved or reconciled.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Jeſus Chriſt (a mighty Perſon) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the Office of a Mediator, and has made peace for many, and will make peace for all the Father hath given him.</p>
            <p>This may be illuſtrated by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up of the breach between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abſalom,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abſalom</hi> were good friends at firſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Abſalom</hi> kills <hi>Amnon,</hi> and thereby offends <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This offence makes a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abſalom. David</hi> is wroth, <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſlees, and dares not come near his Father.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Joab</hi> uſes means, and ſeeks to take up the difference.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By <hi>Joabs</hi> means the breach is made up, and <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abſalom</hi> become good Friends again.</p>
            <p>Even ſo,</p>
            <p n="1">1. God and Man were good Friends at firſt, whiles he retained Gods Image.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Man offends by eating forbidden fruit.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:35693:10"/>
3. This offence makes a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Jeſus Chriſt undertakes to make up the difference.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By means of Jeſus Chriſt God and Man become good Friends again.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How this peace and reconciliation with God was effected, how 'twas brought about.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Much after that manner, and by that means, that <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abſalom</hi> were reconciled.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Davids</hi> heart was towards offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Abſalom,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Davids</hi> Soul longed to go forth unto <hi>Abſalom:</hi> but for ſhame he could have gone himſelf, or ſent others to fetch him home. O the Ocean of Love that is in a Fathers heart! 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 39.</p>
            <p>Even ſo was Gods heart towards tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing offending fallen Man. His Soul longed to go forth unto fallen man. His kindneſs and love towards man appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 4. which <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 7. is called the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindneſs towards us through Chriſt Jeſus. This he ſhewed. <hi>God ſo loved
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35693:11"/>
the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that we might live through him.</hi> Read <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Joab</hi> perceives it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 1. So Chriſt knew the Fathers love to Man, being in his boſom, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>The onely begotten Son which is in the boſom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he hath declared him. None knows the Father but the Son, and he to whomſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Son will reveal him,</hi> Mat. 11. 27.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Joab</hi> intercedes for <hi>Abſaloms</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and reception into favour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs the Woman of <hi>Tekoa</hi> to ſay to <hi>David</hi> among other things, <hi>The iniquity be upon me,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 9.</p>
            <p>So ſaith Chriſt, Man hath ſinned, let his iniquity be upon me.</p>
            <p>As once <hi>Abigail</hi> ſaid to <hi>David</hi> when her Husband had offended, <hi>Upon me, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me let this iniquity be,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 24.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Rebecca</hi> ſaid to <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he feared he ſhould bring a Curſe on him, by ſeeking a bleſſing in a wrong way, <hi>Upon me be thy curſe, Gen.</hi> 27. 13.</p>
            <p>So ſaid Chriſt to his Father, Upon me be the curſe of the Law which Man hath tranſgreſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:35693:11"/>
And as <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Philemon</hi> concerning <hi>Oneſimus, Phil.</hi> 18. <hi>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that upon my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So ſaid Chriſt to his Father, What the ſinner oweth thee put that upon my account. <hi>Lo, I come</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>to do thy will, Pſ.</hi> 40. 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 7, 9.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>David</hi> hearkens to <hi>Joabs</hi> motion, grants his requeſt, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 21.</p>
            <p>So God accepts of his Sons offer, and lays mans iniquities upon him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 6. and <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>The chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Joab</hi> goes to <hi>Geſhur</hi> to ſeek and fetch <hi>Abſalom</hi> back again, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 23.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Christ came into the world to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>to ſeek and ſave lost man, Luke</hi> 19. 10. Which that he might do, more was required of him then was of <hi>Joab</hi> in order to <hi>Abſaloms</hi> return.</p>
            <p>Two things <hi>Joab</hi> did not which Chriſt did, and without the doing of which Man could not have been recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into favour again with God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Joab</hi> did not die at <hi>Geſhur</hi> or <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> for <hi>Abſalom,</hi> to ſatisfie for the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35693:12"/>
bloud of <hi>Amnon,</hi> he onely went to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhur;</hi> but Chriſt when he came into the world to ſave ſinners, he died and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the room and ſtead of ſinners, to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God offended by ſinners. <hi>He died for the ungodly, Rom.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>While we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us, v.</hi> 8. <hi>When we were enemies, we were reconciled unto God by the death of his Son, v.</hi> 10. <hi>The just ſuffered for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. See alſo <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Joab</hi> did not undertake for <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loms</hi> good behaviour for the future; but Jeſus Chriſt did undertake for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that they ſhould be have themſelves better for the future, and by his death merited Faith, Repentance, New Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and Good Behaviour, for them for whom he died. Therefore, ſays he <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me ſhall come to me:</hi> and tells his Hearers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 32. <hi>If he be lifted up from the earth, he will draw all men unto him,</hi> that is, all given to him.</p>
            <p>This God ſtood upon with Chriſt, when he undertook for ſinners. He
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35693:12"/>
muſt and will have his juſtice ſatisfied, which could not be done without dying for, and ſuffering in the room and ſtead of ſinners.</p>
            <p>And ſinners muſt turn from ſin, and lead a better courſe of life, elſe it would not ſtand with Gods Holineſs to receive them into favour and fellowſhip with him.</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate this by a ſimilitude.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe one mediating to a Prince for a Thief, that had greatly wronged ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Eſtate: Upon two conditions, ſays the Prince, I will pardon him;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the wrong done be ſatisfied for, and the loſs ſuſtained be repaired.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he leave off his thieving and former courſe of life, elſe in juſtice and wiſdom, ſays the Prince, I cannot but refuſe your ſuit.</p>
            <p>Now Chriſt does both.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The former by dying for Sinners, and thereby ſatisfying juſtice for the wrong done to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The later, by meriting grace for Sinners, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith and Holineſs, and by ſending his Spirit to work it in them;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35693:13"/>
therefore is the Spirit called,</p>
            <list>
               <item>The Spirit of Faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13.</item>

            <p n="6">6. <hi>Joab</hi> brings <hi>Abſalom</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 2 Sam. 14. 23.</p>
            <p>Chriſt by his care brings Sinners to the Church, to the means of Grace, or the means of Grace to them, as he did to the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 29, 30, 31, 32. Chriſt, as the good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> brings them to an Inn, and Hoſt, and gives charge concerning them, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 34, 35. See alſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 21. 15, 16, 17. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Abſalom</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is troubled that he was not admitted to ſee the Kings Face, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 32.

            <p>So Sinners by the means of grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to a ſight and ſenſe of ſin and miſery, as <hi>Peters</hi> Hearers were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prick'd at heart, and troubled as the Jaylor was, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 29. do long for a ſight of the pleaſed Face of their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

            <p n="8">8. <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſends for <hi>Joab,</hi> but he comes not, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 29.</p>
            <p>So the Sinner by prayer ſends to Chriſt about Gods hiding his Face, but he comes not.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſends a ſecond time, and ſets <hi>Joabs</hi> Corn on fire, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 29, 30. and then <hi>Joab</hi> comes.</p>
            <p>So the Sinner prays and ſends again to Chriſt, and then Chriſt comes.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Paul</hi> prays, and then <hi>Annanias</hi> was ſent to him, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 11.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Cornelius</hi> prayed, and <hi>Peter</hi> was ſent to him, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 2, —20.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Joab</hi> being come <hi>Abſalom</hi> imploys him, and ſends him to the King, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 32.</p>
            <p>So poor penitent ſinners imploy Chriſt by faith, to make peace for them with their offended Father.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>Joab</hi> comes to the King, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to him <hi>Abſaloms</hi> trouble, becauſe he could not ſee his Fathers Face, I <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 33.</p>

            <p>So does God, upon Chriſts appearing for the penitent ſinner, call for him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Come to me poor, labouring, heavy-laden ſinner, and I will give thee reſt.</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. <hi>Ho, every one that is athirst, come.</hi> And <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 37. <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come to me and drink.</hi>

            <p>The giving, ſetting, bending the mind to a thing.</p>
            <p>'Tis to be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon about any thing, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2.</p>

            <p>'Tis to be at it early and late, night and day, as <hi>Paul</hi> was, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 31.</p>
            <p>'Tis to take heed to fulfill our work, as <hi>Archippus</hi> is required, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
            <p>Further,</p>
            <p>'Tis to ariſe and be doing, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 16.</p>

'Tis to take heed that we fail not to do a thing, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. 22.</p>
            <p>'Tis to beſtir ones ſelf, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 24.</p>
            <p>'Tis to be induſtrious about a thing, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 28.</p>

            <p>'Tis to work out with fear and tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p>So then, to be diligent to be found of Chriſt in peace, or a reconciled eſtate with God, it is,</p>
            <p>To be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon about it.</p>
            <p>To be at this work of making peace with God in the morning and in the evening, not to withhold our hand.</p>

To be at this work of making peace with God early and late, night and day.</p>
            <p>To abide at it; and,</p>
            <p>To take heed that we fulfill it, and not fail to do it.</p>
            <p>To wait on it till it be effected.</p>
            <p>To give our ſelves no reſt till it be done.</p>
            <p>To ſeek this peace with God as one would ſeek for Silver, or as one would ſearch for hid Treaſure.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The Reaſons why we muſt give diligence to be at peace, and in a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led eſtate with God, that ſo we may be found of Chriſt in it at his coming, are theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe God having done ſo much in order thereunto, <hi>(viz.</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der towards making peace between God and Man) our negligence in not doing our part in order thereunto, will be a ſlighting of the love and kindneſs of God, which is ſaid to be great, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 4. and <hi>exceeding rich towards us through Christ Jeſus, Eph.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:35693:17"/>
It will be horrible ingratitude, which will cauſe God to cry out and ſay as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Hear O Heavens, and give ear O Earth,</hi> for I have out of my love, and by my wiſdom, found out a way for fallen offending Man to be at peace with me, and he will not accept of it, will not be diligent in the uſe of means to obtain it.</p>
            <p>Now here it may be inquired,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What hath God done towards ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king peace between Man offending and himſelf offended?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. He took counſel about it; both Father and Son took counſel together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6. 13.</p>
            <p>The counſel of Peace-making between God and Man was between them both, not I think between the two Offices of Chriſt, Kingly and Prieſtly, but between the two perſons ſpoken of before, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and he who was to be the Branch. God takes this counſel with him, as he was his Eternal Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with reſpect to his future Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for in that reſpect he was to be the Branch. Hence it may be he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35693:18"/>
is called Counſellor, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6.</p>
            <p>The conſultation was how to ſatisſie Juſtice offended, that ſo the Offender might be received into favour, how Man an enemy to God might be reconciled unto God, and God to him.</p>
            <p>The way thought upon was, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of the ſecond perſon in the Holy Trinity, in order to his ſuffering death in the room and ſtead of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, thereby to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God offended.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He entred into a Covenant and Agreement with his eternally begotten Son about it.</p>
            <p>In order to Peace-making between God and Man,</p>
            <p n="1">1. God demands, requires of his Son, ſuch and ſuch things to be done and ſuffered, <hi>viz.</hi> that he be made under the Law, and that his Soul be made an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10. The tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law of God made the difference between God and Man, and he will not be ſatisfied and reconciled, unleſs this Law be fulfilled. Satisfie the Law and I am ſatisfied, ſays God.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:35693:18"/>
2. The Son accepts and engages to ſatisfie his Fathers demands, <hi>viz.</hi> to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Law, to perform the duty and pay the penalty of it; to do what the Law enjoynes, and to ſuffer what the Law threatens.</p>
            <p>Therefore when he came into the World, he was made under the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. and ſays, <hi>Lo, I come to do thy Will, O God, Heb.</hi> 10. 5. and <hi>Pſ.</hi> 40. 8. <hi>I delight to do thy Will, O God, yea thy Law is within my heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It becometh us, ſaith he to <hi>John</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, to fulfill all righteouſneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>I am not come to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfill it,</hi> Mat. 5. 17. And this he did, that the righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 4.</p>
            <p>How often doth he ſay his Father had ſent him, and that he came to do the Will of him that ſent him? <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 38, 39, 40. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 4. <hi>I muſt work the works of him that ſent me, and in his prayer,</hi> Joh. 17. 4. He tells his Father that he had finiſhed the work he had given him to do.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He takes delight in theſe tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35693:19"/>
between him and his Son about this peace making for Man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 30, 31. The counſel and contrivance of the work of our redemption and ſalvation was the mutual delight of the Father and Son.</p>
            <p>God forſeeing how theſe tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons between him and his Son about mans reconciliation with God would iſſue in his own eternal glory, is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pleaſed therewith. The Father and Son foreſeeing how by this means the Law would be fulfilled, Gods juſtice would be ſatisfied, Gods glory would be repaired, Satan would be trodden under foot, and his works deſtroyed, and poor captives would be delivered, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners reconciled, are greatly delighted. The Father rejoyces in the Sons under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking this work; the Son rejoyces in the Fathers undertaking for his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and aſſiſtance, and ſucceſs in the work. See how 'tis expreſſed, Iſa. 42. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold, mine Elect in whom my ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth, in whom my ſoul is well pleaſed.</hi> Mat. 12. 18. <hi>My beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Mat. 17. 5. and Mat. 3.

17. <hi>I have put my ſpirit upon him, he ſhall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.

Thus ſaith the Lord, he that created the Heavens,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I the Lord have called thee in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a Covenant of the People, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the blind eyes, and to bring out the Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers out of the Priſon, and them that ſit in darkneſs, out of the Priſonhouſe.</hi> The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of theſe things was their delight.</p>

Now all that is in the world is, <hi>the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 16. and whoſoever is a friend of theſe, is an enemy of God. <hi>If any man love theſe, the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not in him,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 15. Theſe luſts do war againſt God and the Soul, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. and they that are at peace with God, and in his favour, and have any love to him and their ſouls, cannot be at peace with theſe, with an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful immoderate deſire after the Profits, Pleaſures, and Honours of this world.

            <p n="3">3. They that are at peace with God, are in care to pleaſe God, and in fear to offend him for the future.</p>
            <p>Care and Fear are the fruits of godly ſorrow for offending God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. They that are at peace with God ſay as <hi>Joſeph</hi> when tempted to ſin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 9. Behold, now I have peace with God, <hi>how then can I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God,</hi> and ſo break my peace with him? Is it thus with you? is there this care and fear in you?</p>
            <p n="4">4. They that are at peace with God are in pain and heavineſs till others, eſpecially near Relations, be alſo at peace with God, as <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>Rom</hi> 9. 1, 2.

            <p n="6">6. They that are at peace with God cannot but wonder, and ſay to God as once <hi>Ruth</hi> ſaid to <hi>Boaz, Ruth</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Why have I found grace in thine eys, that thou ſhouldeſt take knowledge of me, ſeeing I am a ſtranger?</hi> So faith the perſon that is at peace with God, that has found favour

            <p n="7">7. They that are at peace with God are joyful in God through our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, by whom they have received the attonement, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>They rejoyce in Jeſus Chriſt, and have no conſidence in the fleſh.</hi> Phil. 3. 3. <hi>They ſay, not unto us, not unto us, but unto God in Chriſt be all the glory and praiſe of our being at peace with God:</hi> They thank God through Jeſus Chriſt for their being at peace with God.

Now are you thus joyful in God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
            <p n="8">8. They that are at peace with God, do highly eſteem thoſe that have been inſtrumental in making their peace with God: <hi>The feet of thoſe that preach the Goſpel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things, are beautiful to them,</hi> Rom. 10 15.

               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Reproof.</p>
            <p>This reproves thoſe that neglect their duty herein; that give no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to make their peace with God, but go on in their enmity and hoſtility againſt God: As did the old World, <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> when God ſpake unto them by <hi>Noah, Moſes, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>John Raptiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what got they by ſtanding out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God? Had it not been better for the old World to have hearkened unto <hi>Noah,</hi> and for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to have hearkned unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> and for <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to have hearkened to <hi>Daniel,</hi> and for <hi>Herod</hi> to have hearkned to <hi>John,</hi> and ſo to have prevented that deſtruction and miſery which came upon them?</p>
            <p>Did they do ill in ſtanding out againſt God? and is it not ill in you to do the ſame? can you condemn them and not your ſelves? Sirs, you have the offers of peace with God made unto you, if you accept not of the offers, if you hearken not to the counſel God gives you, and ſhall continue not to hearken, 'tis a ſure
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:35693:25"/>
ſign that God will ſlay you. See what was ſaid, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2, 25. concerning <hi>Elie's</hi> Sons, <hi>They hearkened not to the voice of their Father admoniſhing and reproving them, becauſe the Lord would ſlay them.</hi> Dreadful was that word of the Prophet to <hi>Amaziah,</hi> 2 Chron. 25. 16. <hi>I know that God hath determined to deſtroy thee, becauſe thou haſt not hearkened to my counſel.</hi> Great wrath from the Lord of Hoſts may they expect to feel that refuſe to hearken to Gods counſel, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 11, 12, 13. Pray take your Bible and read this Scripture.</p>
            <p>Aſſure your ſelves if you continue in a ſtate of enmity againſt God, not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconciliation, God will find you out. Pſ. 21. 8, &amp;c. <hi>Thine hand ſhall find out all thine enemies; thine right hand ſhall find out thoſe that hate thee; thou ſhalt make them as a fiery Oven in the time of thine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; the Lord ſhall ſwallow them up in his wrath, and the fire ſhall devour them.</hi> And Pſ. 68. 21. <hi>God ſhall wound the head of his Enemies, and the hairy ſcalp of ſuch an one as goeth on ſtill in his treſpaſſes: Yea he will make his Enemies his footſtool,</hi> Pſ 110. 1. <hi>and render vengeance to them,</hi> Deut. 32.

            <p>What elſe can you expect if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in a ſtate of enmity againſt God, ſeeing he has done ſo much, and ſaid ſo much towards peace-making between him and you: What more could be done or ſaid, than he has done and ſaid?</p>
            <p>You have heard that he took counſel about it, and contrived a way that there might be Peace between him and you.</p>
            <p>He entred into a Covenantand A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with his Son about it, and that he undertook the work of making peace and bringing ſinners into an eſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, if they would be ruled by him.</p>
            <p>He took great delight in thoſe tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions between him and his Son about this peace-making for man.</p>
            <p>He hath been at a great deal of coſt &amp; expence of precious blood to obtain it.</p>
            <p>He has taken care that this purchaſed peace might be preached and proffered to you, and ſo it has been again, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and again.</p>
            <p>He has charged and commanded you to accept of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:35693:26"/>
He has written to you about it, and ſent to you about it, and prayed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched you to be at peace with him, and expoſtulated and reaſoned the caſe with you, and wiſhed your acceptance of proffered peace, and waited for it, and what more could he have done? and now after all this, what cloke, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe can you have? See <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 22. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken to them, they had not had ſin, but now they have no cloke for their ſin.</hi> If God had not done all this in order to peace-making between him and you, you might have had ſome plea for your ſelves; but now if you ſhall continue in a ſtate of enmity againſt God, neglecting the means ordained and appointed to be uſed for the obtaining of peace with God, if you ſhall be dealt with as enemies thank your ſelves.</p>

               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Exhortation.</p>

            <p>I think I may ſay of her as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> of himſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 3. That ſhe walked before God in truth and with a perfect heart, and did that which was good in his ſight.</p>
            <p>And as Chriſt of <hi>Nathanael, John</hi> 1. 47.

               <hi>Behold an</hi> Iſraelite <hi>indeed in whom is no guile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Her dying words expreſt much of a Chriſtian indeed. To inſtance:</p>
            <p>They expreſt,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Her expectation of a change: <hi>I do not hope to live long.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Her weannedneſs from the world and ſenſe of the badneſs of it: <hi>For,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>being fit to dye, 'tis the beſt time to dye in, and the worſt age to live in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Her lamenting after God; for ſhe complained of <hi>unprofitableneſs under the means ſhe enjoyed, and of the want of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer refreſhments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Her confidence in God: <hi>For,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>though I am a great ſinner, yet I believe I am a pardoned ſinner, and ſo have reſt and quiet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One ſaying to her, There is need of the Lords help: <hi>Yea,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>and God hath laid help upon one that is mighty, and by his stripes I am healed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One repeating that Scripture, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 116. 6. <hi>The Lord preſerveth the ſimple, I was brought low, and he helped me. Yea,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>the Lord will remember me in my low eſtate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

Her thankfulneſs. <hi>Bleſſed be God,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I have refreſhing though not reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At other times ſhe would ſay: <hi>O the conſolations of the Lord are not ſmall things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Her prayerfulneſs. In her laſt fit ſhe ſaid: <hi>Lord eaſe, Lord help; Pray, pray, pray.</hi> And ſo whiles we were praying for her, ſhe fell aſleep.</p>
            <p>Thus ſhe has given you an Example, as Chriſt did his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 13. 15.</p>
            <p>I will not call you to lamentation, but to imitation I muſt.</p>

            <p>Her ſins and corruptions.</p>
            <p>But what are her gains?</p>
            <p>No tongue can expreſs, nor heart can conceive, what they are.</p>
            <p>She has gained Heaven.</p>
