            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the <hi>Committee</hi> appointed by the
Eſtates of Parliament, taking to
conſideration how the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for putting out of Horſes
may be beſt effectuate, conforme
to the Generall order: Hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
and ordained, that every
man, as well to Burgh as Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wart,
ſhall ſend out a ſufficient
and able Horſe and man armed,
with Jack, and Lance, or with Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols,
Carobine; and that according
to two thouſand markes of rent,
conforme to the valuations, which ſhall be the rule of the Muſtars.
And ſiklike, It is appointed, That every Heritour and Tennent ſhall put
out their beſt and moſt fitting Horſe for that uſe: Neither ſhall any
man whatſoever, bee ſuffered to keepe any good and able fit Horſes
for the Troup at home, but muſt either ſend him out as one of
their proportion for their rent; Or otherwiſe come preſently out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them themſelves, or ſome other friend, as Voluntiers, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

becauſe Barrons, and Gentle-men of good ſort, are the greateſt and
moſt powerfull part of the Kingdome, by whoſe valour the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
hath ever beene defended: Wee doe moſt earneſtly require and
expect, that every Barron and Gentle-man of good ſort, ſhall come
to the Armie in their owne perſons, or at leaſt ſend their ableſt ſon,
brother, or friend. And that all Noble-men, Gentle-men, and others,
may bee the better encouraged to come out as Voluntiers in ſo good
a Cauſe, for maintenance of Religion, and preſervation of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this ancient and never conquered Kingdome, which wee are
all ſworne to maintaine. It is earneſtly deſired, That all brave Cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers
will take the buſineſſe to heart, and conſider that now or never
is the time to gaine Honour, and Eternall reputation, and to ſave or
loſſe their Countrie. Like as, It is heereby declared, That who ſhall
ſo come out as Voluntiers (havng put out their proportions in good
and able Horſes as ſaid is) Shal have libertie to ſerve upon their
owne beſt Horſes themſelves as Voluntiers, and ſhall have corne to
their Horſes out of the common Magazine, and good quarters for
themſelves; And ſhall not bee put to toileſome watching, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
