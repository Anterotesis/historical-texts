         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>3ly. The reaſons drawne from the inconveniencies and miſchiefs of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Infants to be Members, are many.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, it is of one of the ſaddeſt judgments God threatens to his people</hi>
That he will give them Children to be their Princes and Babes to rule over them
Iſa 3. 4. Eccleſ. 10. 16. <hi>and then what followes.</hi> The people ſhall be oppreſſed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

be miſcheivous and an heavy judgment to have Children and Babes in Law,

Senators, and Elders of our Realme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2ly. It is of very dangerous conſequence for Infants to be admitted Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
eſpecially in theſe times of greateſt conſultation, action, danger, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
For firſt, if any one Infant may <hi>de jure</hi> be a Member of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of Children, a Senat of Babes, if all Cities, Burgeſſes, were ſo Childiſh
ſo fooliſh, and injurious to the publike in their elections of ſuch, as ſom
[through the importunity of friends] have bin. Now how dangerous this
may prove to the Kingdom, let all wiſe men judge, by the example of King

            <p>3ly. Admit the Commons Houſe ſhould determine, how many Infants they
would allow to be Members, (perhaps not above five or ſix to prevent this
inconvenience) yet the miſchiefe and danger of admitting ſo few may prove
very great, not only in regard of the illneſſe of the Preſident in theſe ſignall
times of Reformation, but of the probable dangerous conſequences of it.
It was a prudent ſpeech of a blunt Burgeſle when he was ſolicited to give his
voyce for a young novice;<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> 
               <hi>This is no Parliament to enter whelps in, therefore

if the wheele of fortune ſhould turne againſt the Parliament by any

(eſpecially when any new Lawes or formes of Government are to be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced

(if in any thing in the world) opinion hath no leſſe, and oftentimes more
force then the truth it ſelfe; Neither is there any thing in a Commonweale
more dangerous, then for Subjects to have an ill opinion of their Councellers, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours

not, what iſſue is to be expected?</hi> ſurely diſobedience, ſedition, Rebellion, ruine,
It behoves therefore our preſent Parliament, if they would prevent this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
miſchiefe, to expell all Infant (as well as Malignant) Members, which
may draw a very great diſparagment, contempt, or diſeſteem upon their
Councels, Votes, <hi>Ordinances, Laws,</hi> not only in the opinions of Royaliſts and
Malignants, but of grave, wiſe well affected perſons of Eminency and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
who perchance will tacitly deem it no ſmall diſparagement, if not injury
and folly for them, to ſubmit their Lives, Liberties, Eſtates, Lawes, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences

fined, amerced, or impriſoned for any Laches, default, abſence or negligence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he is not of full diſcretion:</hi> Therefore he cannot be a Member of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by the expreſſe reſolution of theſe Authorities and this ſtatute; even
for this very miſchiefe, becauſe he cannot bee amerced impriſoned or puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
as other Members are and ought to be, in caſe of abſence, or undue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
rom the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Admit the forementioned miſchiefes ſhould all prove but contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
and future, yet this one preſent miſchiefe happens by Infants Elections,
that they keep out abler Members, and deprive the Parliament, Kingdome of
the aſſiſtance, Councell, abilities of more diſcreete, wiſe, active, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced.
Venerable perſons then themſelves, who by reaſon of their Infancy,
and want of experience, are no ways ſerviceable, active in the Houſe or in
Committees, where they commonly ſit as Ciphers, to keep out Figures, and
men of greater parts and eminency. I have ought times admired at the ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſſe
of people in reſigning up their Lives, Liberties, Eſtates, Laws, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,

               </gap> of ſuch Novices and unconfiding Members whom
they Elect to repreſent and Vote for them in Parliament, as themſelves would
diſdain to adviſe with, or make uſe of in any other imployment. No man is ſo
fooliſh as to make choice of a young raw unexperienced unskilfull Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
to be his <hi>Pilot, Phyſitian, Lawyer, Advocate, Commander,</hi> eſpecially if the
Voyage, Diſeaſe, Caſe Service, bee dangerous or difficult; but will reſort to
the skilfuleſt <hi>Pilots, Phyſitians, Lawyers, Advocates, Souldiers,</hi> in ſuch caſes.
And ſhould they not much more do thus in their choyce of Members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
eſpecially in theſe dangerous and tempeſtuous times, when the ſhip
of our Church, State are extreamely indangered by ſtormes and rockes;
the whole body of our three Kingdomes, Churches deſperately diſeaſed,
wounded, lacerated, their caſe very dubious if not deſperate; and their ſervice
ſo hot, ſo difficult, that it requires the Conduct of the moſt experienced Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
to bring them off with ſafety? Certainly if they doe it not, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of ſome few unable Members and preterition of others of greater
abilities in this juncture of time of affaires of higheſt concernment, may ruin
us and our Poſterities for ever. The conſideration therefore of theſe recited
miſchiefes ſhould, and will no doubt enduce the Parliament, to remove
all ſuch Infants and illegall Members, (as well as Malignants and Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts)
out of the Commons houſe, or Prelates and Popiſh Peeres, out of the
houſe of Lords.</p>
            <p>Seventhy, It is miſchievous even in this regard, that it is an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
diſhonour to our whole Parliament and Nation, to ſuffer Infants to ſit as
Judges, Councellors in the ſupreameſt Judicature and Councell of our three
Kingdoms, which gives Lawes to <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> all the Kings Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
except <hi>Scotland</hi> on which it hath a great influence to, by reaſon of the
mutuall brotherly League betweene both Nations,] eſpecially in ſuch a
time of Reformation, Conſultation, Circumſpection, and action as this is.
What think you will foraign Nations report of our Parliament, our Nation,
if they ſhall heare of Infants, Wards, Minors ſitting yea Voting as Members
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117162:7"/>
as Judges among our Knights, Citizens, Burgeſſes now the greateſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ever debated in any Parliament are in agitation? will they not ſay, our
Kingdome is either voyd of wiſe experienced Senators, that we Elect ſuch
Novices; or that all our wiſe ancient men, or our electors are turned Children.
Naturalls in making ſuch a choyce, and our Parliament very neglectfull of
their owne honour in petmitting ſuch Aſſociats to ſit among them, in caſe
the Kingdome can afford them others of more Antiquity Ability, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience?
To prevent therefore this diſhonour abroad, and the ſcoffs of
Royaliſts and Malignants at home (who jeare us with theſe <hi>Childiſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant

doubt but the Houſe of Commons will unanimouſly reſolve, their Elections
void in Law, and their Electors worthy publike cenſure, for putting ſuch a

            <p>I ſhall conclude with the opinion and reſolution of reverend and learned
Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> (the oldeſt and beſt experienced Parliament man in this

neither <hi>can any Lord of Parliament ſit there untill he be of the full age

            <p>Having thus given you a briefe Account of the reaſons of mine Opinion
concerning the Queſtion propounded, I ſhall in the next place returne a
ſhort Anſwer to ſome Objections; and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p>The 1.<note place="margin">Object.</note> Objection is this: That the Election of Knights, Citizens, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes,
and Members of Parliament belongs to the Freeholders, Citizens,
Burgeſſes and Freemen who elect them; if they therefore ſhall make choice
of any Infants as the fitteſt or ableſt perſons to ſerve for them in Parliament,
their Election muſt ſtand good, otherwiſe they ſhall be deprived of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and priviledge of a free Election.</p>
            <p>To this I Anſwer, 1. That no Freeholders, Citizens or Burgeſſes, have any
abſolute power to elect what Members they pleaſe,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>it. <hi>p.</hi> 47</note> cannot elect a ſheriffe a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> a man beyond the Seas, a Iudge or
attendant in the Lords houſe, to be <hi>Knight of any</hi> County, becauſe it is contrary
to Law, <hi>expreſſe ſtatuts and the VVrit it ſelfe:</hi> and if they make choice of any
ſuch, the Houſe may adjudge the Election void, and put them to a better
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117162:8"/>
election of ſitting Members. They cannot elect theſe or Peere of the Realme,
an Idiot, a <hi>Non Compos,</hi> Alien, Woman, &amp;c. to be a Citizen or Burgeſſe of
Parliament: and if they do ſo the election is void, becauſe the perſons are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable.
Therefore by the ſelfeſame reaſon they cannot elect an Infant.
Where a perſon is uncapable by Law, the Electors cannot make him capable
of being a Member.</p>
            <p>2ly. The Houſe of Commons, not the Electors, are the ſole Judges of the
Fitnes, the capability of the perſons elected and if any Counties, Cities, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs
be ſo indiſcreet and injurious to the Kingdome as to elect unworthy
Members, contrary to the Writ and their duty, the houſe may juſtly caſt
them out againe, notwithſtanding the Election, which concludes them not.
This the preſidents of former Parliaments in expeling unworthy &amp; unſitting
Members, together with the practiſe of this ſitting Parliament in ejecting
all <hi>Monopoliſts, Projectors</hi> at the firſt, and all Malignant Members ſince,
who deſerted, or betrayed their truſt, abundantly manifeſts. Therefore by
the ſelfeſame reaſon, they may and ought to expell Infants the Houſe, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting
and illegall Members, as well as Projectors, Monopoliſts and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants
as <hi>unworthy</hi> ones.</p>
            <p>3ly I dare confideutly affirme, that no Cittie, or Borough did ever free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of their owne accords make choice of any <hi>VVard,</hi> or <hi>Infant</hi> to ſerve in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
for them; as the ableſt or fitteſt of any other, to do themſelves and the
Kingdome ſervice in Parliament; or as the ſufficienteſt, ableſt and diſcreeteſt
perſons, according as the writ directs them, but meerely through the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-earneſt
ſolicitation, threats or over-rulling power of the Infants friends,
to whom they ſtood engaged for favours, or durſt not offend, leaſt they ſhould
turne their foes, not out of meere publike reſpects, which all electors
in juſtice and prudence ſhould only aime at. Therefore it is altogether
unreaſonable, that the election of Infants, grounded meerly on ſuch baſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat
reſpects as theſe, ſhould defraud the Parliament and whole Kingdome of
the choice of abler Members; <hi>ſince</hi>
               <note n="u" place="margin">Cookes 4. Inſtit. <hi>p.</hi> 14.</note> 
               <hi>every Member elected for any particular
Borough, when once admitted, Votes and ſerves not only for it, but for the whole
Kingdome too, to whom thoſe who make unworthy elections for private ends</hi> or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
do moſt apparent wrong which the Houſe hath power to right, elſe
we might have our Parliament ſtuffed with Infants, Malignants, &amp;c. if
people be ſo fooliſh to Elect them in all places, as they have beene inſome.</p>
            <p>The 2d.<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> Objection is this. That ſome Infants under the age of 21. have
bin permitted to ſit as Members in former Parliaments: Therefore by like
reaſon they may be admitted in this upon our new Elections.<note place="margin">Anſwer</note>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, Firſt, that no Infant ought<note n="*" place="margin">See Cooke 9. Rep. f. 49.</note> 
               <hi>de jure</hi> to ſit in any Parliament as I
have manifeſted; therefore not in this. 2ly. None ever ſate in former Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
of right, but only by connivance, when either the Houſe took no
notice of them, or their Elections were not queſtioned; or if queſtioned,
(as they have ſundry times bin) &amp; not ejected the buſines hath bin compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
without comming to any ſolemne debate &amp; reſolution in the Houſe.</p>
            <p>3ly. The connivance of former Parliaments in this kinde is no preſident
to over-rule or bind our preſent Parliament, for theſe enſuing reſpects. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there are more weighty, difficult affaires concerning our Church, State
and three whole Kingdoms to be conſulted upon debated and ſettled in this
Parliament then in any, yea all the Parliaments of former ages united.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:117162:9"/>
2ly. Becauſe there are greater differences, diſtractions between the King
and Parliament, and more labouring to make parties in the Houſe to ſerve
ends [if poſſible then in any former Age.</p>
            <p>3ly. Becauſe a greater reformation is now expected, promiſed, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in Church, State, Parliaments then in any preceedent times.</p>
            <p>4ly. Becauſe the Acts, and Members of this Parliament more concerne the
Kingdome to be free from all juſt exceptions, and are likely to bee more
narrowly ſcanned, ſifted, both for the preſent and future times, then the
Members or proceedings of any former Parliaments, and the leaſt juſt
flaw againſt them may in after ages prove dangerous if not fatall to revoke
or ſhake what ever ſhall be concluded by them now if not timely prevented.</p>
            <p>5. Becauſe this Parliament is more laſting then any other, and happily
may prove diuturnal, if not perpetuall.</p>
            <p>6. Becauſe both Houſes have made a more exact purgation of unſitting, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Members, in this, then in any Parliament in former ages, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in Juſtice ought to diſplace all unable or unſitting Members (as well
Infants as any others) to avoid the juſt cenſure of partiality.</p>
            <p>7. Becauſe more exceptions, cavils are &amp; will be made againſt undue electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Members now, by Malignants, Royaliſts, Prelates, then to any Members,
Elections in former ages; Therefore the Houſe ſhould bee more carefull
what Members they now admit, then they were in former times, when there
were no ſuch unhappy diviſions betweene the King &amp; Parliament as now.</p>
            <p>The 3d.<note place="margin">Object. 3.</note> Objection is this: That the Infants in the Houſe are not many,
and they are led by the Votes of wiſer and more able Members; therefore
the danger is not great.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, 1. That if no Infant be capable of being a Member, then none
ought to be admitted,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> be they many or few. 2ly Though they be but few for
the preſent, yet there may be more hereafter elected, there being new en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to bring in more. 3ly. One or two in judicious Infant Members
Votes in matters of momen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, when the Houſe comes to bee devided, may
prove very dangerous. 4. Every Parliament man ought to Vote according
to his owne judgment not anothers only, and it is very dangerous for any to
Vote with ſuch and ſuch perſons only in the Houſe, and to make their Votes
the ſole ground of their concurrent <hi>Ay</hi> or <hi>No;</hi> is the high way to factions.</p>
            <p>The 4th.<note place="margin">Object. 4.</note> and principall Objection is this: That it will be both conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
and expedient that young Gentlemen under age of Honourable Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies

it being the beſt Schoole of Experience to educate, to improve young
Gentlemen and ſit them for publike Action: Vpon which ground the eldeſt
Sons of Peeres are admitted to ſit in the Lords Houſe and heare their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
to enable them the better to ſerve the Kingdome when they come to

though moſt Members of Parliament, as well old as young may learne much
knowledge and experience by ſitting there, (as all Judges, or other Officers do

not as Schollers or Auditors in a Schoole, but as Iudges and Councelors of

which truſt, they muſt have ſome competent abilities of wiſdome and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
requiſite for Iudges and Councellors of ſtate, (which Infants want)
before they can be admitted Members into this higheſt publike Schoole,
into which none ought to be elected, but ſuch <hi>wiſe men, who know both times,
Law, and Iudgment: Eſth.</hi> 1. 13. eſpecially in ſuch times as theſe. 2ly. It is an
abſurdity, if rightly ſtated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> implying, aſſerting, that Infants may be elected to
ſit and Vote as Members in Parliament for the preſent, to enable them to be

               <hi>ſit to diſcharge it at the very inſtant when they are elected,</hi>
Is any Father, Schoole-Maſter ſo inconſiderate or abſurd, to ſend his Son or
Scholler to the Univerſity, before he be fit for a Grammer-Schoole, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to fit and enable him for the Vniverſity? will the King, or Parliament,
think it juſt or reaſonable to make a puny Barreſter Lord Chiefe Juſtice of
<hi>England</hi> for the preſent, the better to enable him to be a Judge or Chiefe
Juſtice for the future in his riper yeares, though unfit, unable at the time of
his Parent to be a puny Iudge? Will any be ſo ſenceleſſe, as to create a puny
Schoole-boy chiefe Maſter of any Free-ſchoole during his Minority, the
better to abilitate him to diſcharge that Office twenty yeares after, when hee
comes to perfect age? Why then ſhould any Infants be elected Parliament
men for the preſent, before they are actually fit or capable, upon this poore
ſurmiſe, that it will the better inſtruct them to be able Parliament men in
future times? Certainly this is and muſt be like the corrupt practiſe of the
late Prelates, who would firſt admit men to benefices with cure of ſoules,
which they were unable to diſcharge for the preſent and then grant them
diſpenſations to be reſident in our Vniverſities for five or ſix years ſpace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
of purpoſe to fit them to execute their cures and diſcharge their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
ſome five or ſix yeares after their inſtitutions and inductions to
their Benefices. 3ly. I dare averre, that Infants by following their ſtudies
cloſe in the Vniverſity and Innes of Court during their minorities, will arre
better improve themſelves to ſerve their Country in Parliament in after
times when they come to yeares of full diſcretion, then by ſpending their
time idlely in the Houſe, where they commonly ſit like Cyphers with out
ſpeaking or obſerving ought that is materiall, which takes them oft from
their preſent ſtudies, and bladders them with ſelfe-conceits of their owne
ſuperlative worth, &amp; abilities. 4ly. Admit the Objection true, yet the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
and diſhonour the Kingdome, whole Parliament ſhall undergoe by
the permiſſion of ſuch unable Members, is no wayes recompenced, by that
little wiſdome or experience which two or three Infants may poſſibly gaine
by being Members for the preſent, who happily may never live to ſerve in
future Parliaments, or prevatica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
