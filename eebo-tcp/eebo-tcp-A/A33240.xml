            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Have not presumed in any manner to approach Your Royal Presence since I have
been marked with the Brand of Banishment; And I would still<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the same
awe forbear this Presumption, if I did not believe my self bound by all the
obligations of Duty to make this Address to You. I have been too much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the presumption and impudence of the Times, in raising false and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
reproaches upon Innocent and worthy Persons of all Qualities and Degrees,
to give credit to those bold Whispers which have been too long scattered abroad
concern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ng your Wives being shaken in her Religion: But when those whispers break
out into noise, and publick Persons begin to report that the <hi>Dutchess</hi> is become a
<hi>Roman Catholick:</hi> When I heard that many Worthy Persons of unquestionable Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to your R. H are not without some fear and apprehension of it; and many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
are made from thence to the prejudice of your Royal Person, and even of
the Kings Majesties; I hope it may not misbecome me, at what distance soever, to
cast my self at your Feet, and beseech you to look to this matter in time, and to
apply some Antidote to expel the Poison of it. It is not possible your R H. can be
without Zeal, and Intire Devotion for that Church, for the Purity and Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
whereof your Blessed Father made himself a Sacrifice; and to the Restoration
whereof You have contributed so much your self, and which highly deserves the
Kings Protection and yours, since there can be no possible defection in the hearts
of the People, whilst due Reverence is made to the Church. Your Wife is so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
believed to have so perfect Duty, and Intire Resignation to the Will of your H.
that any defection in Her from her Religion, will be imputed to want of circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in You, and not using your Authority; or to your connivance. I need not tell
the ill consequence that such a mutation would be attended with, in reference to
your R. H. and even to the King himself, whose greatest security (under God,) is
in the affection and Duty of his Protestant Subjects. Your R. H. well knows how
far I have always been from wishing that the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> should be prosecuted
with severity; but I less wish it should ever be in their power to be able to prosecute
those who differ from them, since we well know how little moderation they would
or could use.</p>
                  <p>And if this which People so much talk of, (I hope without ground,) should fall
out, it might very probably raise a greater storm against the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
than modest Men can wish; since after such a breach, any Jealousie of their
presumption would seem reasonable. I have written to the <hi>Dutchess</hi> with the freedom
and affection of a troubled and perplext Father. I do most humbly beseech your R H.
by your Authority to rescue Her from bringing a Mischief upon You and her self, that
never can be repaired; and to think it worthy Your Wisdom to remove and dispell
those reproaches (how false soever,) by better Evidence then Contempt, and hope
You do believe that no severity I have or can undergo, shall in any degree lessen or
diminish my most profound Duty to His Majesty or Your R. H. but that I do with all
imaginable Obedience submit to Your good Pleasure in all things;</p>
                  <closer>God Preserve Your R. H. and keep me in your favour,

            <head>THE
Earl of Clarendons
LETTER
TO THE
Dutchess of YORK.</head>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>YOu have much reason to believe that I have no mind to trouble you, or displease
you, especially in an argument that is so unpleasant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and grievous to my self; but as
no distance of place that is between us, in respect of our Residence, or the greater
distance in respect of the high condition you are in, can make me less your Father, or
absolve me from performing those obligations which that Relation requires from me:
So when I receive any Credible advertisement of what reflects upon You, in point of
Honour, Conscience, or Discretion, I ought not to omit the informing You of it,
or administring such advice to You, as to my understanding seems reasonable, and
which I must still hope will have some Credit with You: I will confess to You, that
what You wrote to me many Months since, upon those Reproaches which I told You
were generally reported concerning Your defection in Religion, gave me so much satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
that I believed them to proceed from that ill Spirit of the Time that delights in
Slanders and Calumny; but I must tell You, the same Report increases of late very
much, and I my self saw a Letter the last week from <hi>Paris,</hi> from a person who said
the <hi>English</hi> Embassador assured him the day before, that the Dutchess was become a
Roman Catholick; and which makes greater Impression upon me, I am assured that
many good men in <hi>England,</hi> who have great Affection for You and me, and who
have thought nothing more impossible, then that there should be such a Change in
You, are at present under much affliction, with the observation of a great Change in
Your course, of Life and that constant Exercise of that Devotion which was so noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;
and do apprehend from Your frequent Discourses, that you have not the same
Reverence and Veneration, which You use to have, for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the
Church in which you were Baptized, and the Church the best Constituted, and the
most free from Errors of any Christian Church this day in the World; and that some
persons by their Insinuations have prevailed with You to have a better Op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nion of that
which is most opposite to it, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then the Integrity thereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves.
It is not yet in my power to believe that Your wit and understanding (with
Gods blessing upon both) can suffer you to be shaken further then with Melancholick
reflections upon the Iniquity and wickedness of the Age we live in, which discredits all
Religion, and which with equal license breaks into the Professors of all, and prevails
upon the members of all Churches, and whose Manners will have no benefit from the
Faith of any Church.</p>
                  <p>I presume You do not intangle Your self in the particular Controversies between the
Romanists and us, or think Your self a Competent Judge of all difficulties which occur
therein; and therefore it must be some fallacious argument of Antiquity and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality
confidently urged by men who know less then many of those You are acquainted
with, and ought less to be believed by You, that can raise any doubts or scruples in
You; and if You will with equal temper hear those who are well able to inform You
in all such particulars, it is not possible for You to suck in that poison which can only
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93434:2"/>
corrupt and prevail over You, by stopping Your own Ears and shutting Your own Eyes.
There are but two persons in the World who have greater Authority with You then I
can pretend to, and am sure they both suffer more in this Rumour, and would suffer
much more if there were ground for it, then I can do; and truly I am as unlikely to be
deceived my self, or to deceive You, as any man who endeavours to pervert You in
Your Religion: And therefore I beseech You let me have so much Credit with You, as
to perswade you to communicate any Doubts or Scruples which occur to You, before
You suffer them to make too deep an Impression upon You. The common Argument
that there is no Salvation out of the Church, and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is that only
true Church, is both irrational and untrue; there are many Churches in which Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
may be attained as well as in any one of them: And were many even in the
Apostles time, otherewise they would not have directed their Epistles to so many several
Churches, in which there were different Opinions received and very different Doctrines
taught. There is indeed but one Faith in which we can be saved, the stedfast belief of
the Birth, Passion and Resurrecti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n of our Saviour; and every Church that receives
and imbraces that Faith is in a state of Salvation; if the Apostles Preacht true Doctrine,
the reception and retention of many Errors, does not destroy the Essence of a Church;
if it did, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would be in as ill, if not in a worse Condition, then most
other Christian Churches, because its Errors are of a greater magnitude, and more
destructive to Religion. Let not the Canting Discourse of the Universality and extent
of that Church, which has as little of Truth as the rest, prevail over You; they who
will imitate the greatest part of the World, must tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n Heathens, for it is generally
believed that above half the World is possessed by them, and that the <hi>Mahumet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ns</hi>
possess more then half the remainder: There is as little question that of the rest which
is inhabited by Christians, one part of four is not of the Communion of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and God knows in that very Communion there is as great discord in Opinion,
and in matters of as great moment, as is between the other Christians.</p>
                  <p>I hear you do in publick discourses dislike some things in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as
the Marriage of the Clergy which is a point that no <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> will pretend to
be of the Essence of Religion, and is in use in many places which are of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> as in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and those parts of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church which
submit to the <hi>Roman:</hi> And all men know, that in the late Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of both kinds, and liberty of the Clergy to marry, was very passionately press'd
both by the Emperor and King of <hi>France,</hi> for their Dominions; and it was afterwards
granted to <hi>Germany,</hi> though under such conditions as made it ineffectual: which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
shews that it was not, nor ever can be look'd upon as matter of Religion.
Christianity was many hundred years old, before such a restraint was ever heard of
in the Church; and when it was endeavoured, it met with great opposition, and was
never submitted to. And as the positive Inhibition seems absolutely unlawful, so the
Inconveniences which result from thence, will upon a just disquisition be found supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to those which attend the liberty, which Christian Religion permits. Those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
which are not strong enough to draw persons from the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion,
into that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when Custom and Education, and a long stupid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
of all their faculties to their Teachers, usually shuts out all Reason to the
contrary may yet be abundant to retain those who have been Baptized, and Bred
and Instructed in the Grounds and Principles of that Religion, which are in truth not
only founded upon the clear Authority of the Scriptures, but upon the consent of
Antiquity, and the Practice of the Primitive Church; and men who look into Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
know well by what Corruption and Violence, and with what constant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Opposition those Opinions which are contrary to ours, crept into the World;
and how unwarrantably the Authority of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> which alone supports all
the rest, came to prevail, who hath no more pretence of Authority and Power in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
than the Bishop of <hi>Paris</hi> or <hi>Tole<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o</hi> can as reasonably lay claim to; and is so far
from being matter of Catholick Religion, that the Pope hath so much, and no more to
do in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or any other Catholick Dominion, then the Crown, and Laws
and Constitutions of several Kingdoms gave him leave; which makes him so little, (if
at all,) considered in <hi>France,</hi> and so much in <hi>Spain:</hi> And therefore the <hi>English</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
which attribute so much to him, make themselves very unwarrantably of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93434:3"/>
Religion than the Catholick Church professeth; and without doubt they who
desert the Church of <hi>England,</hi> of which they are Members, and become thereby dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
to the Ecclesiastical and Civil Laws of their Country, and therein renounce
their subjection to the State, as well as to the Church, (which are grievous sins)
had need have a better excuse then the meeting with some doubts which they could
not answer; and less then a manifest evidence that their Salvation is desperate in that
Communion, cannot serve their turn: And they who imagine they have such an
evidence, ought rather to suspect that their Understanding hath forsaken them, and that
they are become mad, then that the Church which is replenished with all Learning
and Piety requisite, can betray them to Perdition. I beseech you to consider, (which
I hope will over-rule those ordinary Doubts and Objections which may be infus'd into
you) that if you change your Religion, you renounce all Obedience and Affection to
your Father, who loves you so tenderly, that such an odious mutation would break
his heart; you condemn your Father and your Mother, (whose incomparable virtue,
and piety and devotion hath plac'd her in Heaven) for having impiously Educated
you; and you dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

must look to be deprived, for God forbid that after such an Apostasie, you should have

                  <p>I know you are not inclined to any part of this mischief, and therefore offer those
Considerations, as all those particulars would be the infallible Consequence of such a
Conclusion. It is to me the saddest circumstance of my Banishment, that I may not
be admitted, in such a season as this, to confer with you; when I am confident I could
satisfie you in all your Doubts, and make it appear to you, that there are many
Absurdities in the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, inconsistent with your Judgment and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and many Impieties inconsistent with your Conscience; so that before you can
submit to the Obligations of Faith, you must divest your self of your Natural Reason,
and common Sense, and captivate the dictates of your own Conscience, to the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of an Authority which hath not any pretence to oblige or advise you. If you
will not with freedom communicate the Doubts which occur to you, to those near
you, of whose Learning and Piety you have had much experience, let me Conjure you
to impart them to me, and to expect my answer before You suffer them to prevail over
You.</p>
