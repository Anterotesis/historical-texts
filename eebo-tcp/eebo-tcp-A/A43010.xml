            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I.</head>
            <head type="sub">Containing the Description of the
Art of Expectation.</head>
            <p>1. IF Antiquity be capable of
conferring Validity, the <hi>Art
of Expectation</hi> being contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
with that of <hi>Physick,</hi>
may be termed equally valuable.
In many cases they are synony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
where the Cure is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55231:4"/>
to the Art of Medicine,
which in reality was chiefly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by the <hi>Art of Expectation;</hi>
the Remidies, that were the Tools
of the former, being of little or no
efficacy, and consequently deluso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
whereas Time, Delays, and
doing nothing, are the principal
<hi>media</hi> of the latter. Hence may
easily be apprehended, what is
meant by curing Diseases by <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
viz.</hi> The applying of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
that do little hurt, and
less good, from which the Patient
day by day frustraneously epect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
relief, and benefit, is at last de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
so long, that Nature, and
Time have partially, or entirely,
cured the Disease, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Physician by subtlety,
cunning, and officiousness, doth
commonly with success insinuate,
that the Petient is Debitor for his
Life, and recovery, to the Doctor's
Skill, Judgment, Method, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies;
and in this particular, the
wisest of men do become half Fools,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55231:4"/>
by intrusting their Lives, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obedience to most Physicians,
of whom, or their Art, they are
incapable of judging, by reason of
their being unacquainted with the
inside of their Persons, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of their Profession.</p>
            <p>2. Suppose your self cured of an
Ague, Catarrh, Sickness of Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
or twenty other Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
by taking twice or thrice a
day, <hi>horis medicis,</hi> for ten days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
five grains of Tobacco-pipe
powder, (which by a reputed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
and most Learned Physician,
shall be hinted to be Magistery of
Pearl) or by swallowing down, in
the same Medicinal Method, five
grains of <hi>Terra damnata Vitrioli,</hi> or
powder of a well-burnt Earthen
Pipkin, intimated to be prepared
Gold. This probably hath cost you
six or eight pounds. You are now
certainly restored <hi>(tuto, cito, &amp; ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunde)</hi>
to your health, and all is
well. Be you never so rich, so
great, or so wise a man, will not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55231:5"/>
your own judgment convince you
of folly beyond Idiotism, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made in the preceding case a
Physician your Trustee, and giving
credit to his pretended Cure, which
is no other, than was effected by
the <hi>Art of Expectation,</hi> in manner
following? From the first Dose of
Powder you perceived no benefit,
though you were willing to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded,
that what advancement
was made towards recovery, was
insensible, and therefore you were
contented, to expect five or six
days for a sensible abatement, and
so <hi>de die in diem,</hi> until in good truth
it was your abstinence from Flesh,
and strong Liqours, gave your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
leisure and opportunity, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest,
separate, and expell those
morbifick Humours.</p>
            <p>3. That this is so, is apparent
in poor men, whose straightness
of Fortune not permitting, to make
application to Doctors or Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries,
by fasting, and keeping
themselves from the injuries of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55231:5"/>
Air, are cured of slight Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
that are curable by Nature,
and the Art of <hi>Expectation,</hi> in the
same space of time the Doctors do
require, to set up the rich. As for
great Diseases, where a true me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
and effectual Remedies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
necessary, more owe their
Deaths to Physicians, than are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendedly
cured by them, as I have
more clearly, and faithfully shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>Conclave of Physicians.</hi>
However, it is to the <hi>Art of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation</hi>
Physicians are indebted for
their Reputation, that occasions
the ignorant World to continue
the use of them. By the way, I
have in the preceding Paragraph
only proposed a supposal of Pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin,
and Tobacco-pipe powder,
which I now tell you, is not a
<hi>merum suppositum non supponendum,</hi>
but hath been knavishly practised
by some Physicians, with a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
equal to what could have
been expected from a Magistery of
Pearl, or an <hi>Aurum diaphoreticum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:55231:6"/>
4. As for those particulars, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I shall instance the Exercise of
the <hi>Art of Expectation,</hi> though they
are not Pipkin powders, they are
very analogal unto 'em. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
if the <hi>Art of Expectation</hi>
was not more universal than Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
whence doth it happen, that
many Illiterates, as Gun-smiths,
Heel-makers, regenerate high-way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
some Apothecaries, and some
Surgeons, do cure a far greater
number than the chiefest of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,
were it not, that they are
equally skill'd in the <hi>Art of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation.</hi>
These <hi>Expectation-Doctors</hi>
are the safe men, the good Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
Doctors, much in request
among some wise Women. They
are such, as in difficult Diseases kill
by omission, and cure easie Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
by seeming to do something
of no importance.</p>

this universal distinction a more
specifick sub-distinction, abstracted
from the particular matter they
operate upon, seems necessary. Some
wholly dedicating themselves to
Iron or Steel, and Syrup of Steel,
make use of its efforts against all
Diseases, and do justly deserve the

the Milk Diet, or Asses Milk

A third sort, giving themselves
over to the Jesuits Powder, will
be called <hi>Iesuitical-Doctors, sourbs</hi>
from the top to the bottom. A

is prefered by some in all cases,
that are <hi>Butcher-Doctors.</hi> The last,
who are the most numerous, aver
all Distempers are to be expell'd
at the Fundament, and these are
the <hi>T—rd Doctors.</hi> Here the Art
of Physick, Monster like, appears
to walk upon six Legs, though
every Physician stands but upon
one, yet not so firmly, but is apt to
be totter'd by every slight Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and a difficult one throws him
down to the Ground, whence he
easily, like a Jugler, starts up again,
and recovering his one Leg, claps
his Wings, and crows himself Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror

of the Disease, though with
an usurp'd Title.</p>
            <p>2. For the good of the common
Cause, these Physicians, though
debauch'd into different Methods of
Practice, all make a consort in one
Cant, that by their sedulous disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries

besides a hundred little particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
of no other use than the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

have so far out-started all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,

which before was scarce an <hi>Embryo;</hi>
and all this to enchant you into a
firm faith of their Abilities, to bait
and allure you into their Physick

are much short of the Candor, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty,

their Steel Medicines into golden
Fees. The effects derived from the
various principles of Iron, opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
according to the disposition of
subjects they meet with in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
prove as oft fatal and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
as seldom happy and hoped
for; a powerful detersive, and diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick,
is observed in the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of
Steel, when it encounters with an
acid in the humors, proper to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
it to combat, otherwise it unites
with the vitriolick Salt, and both
run into a cement, which adding
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55231:9"/>
a stronger fastness to Obstructions,
doth frequently bung up the Vessels
entirely. Judgment and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
are in no case useful, as in
adapting this Mineral to proper
Constitutions. It is more <hi>bruited</hi>
for the killing, then curative part;
if you hit the mark right in the
choice of it, you may perform a
cure very wonderful; if you miss,
the event is deplorable. Instances
of the first kind are by far exceeded
in number by the latter.</p>
            <p>By three or four large bleedings
(as I remember) advised by a
<hi>Coach-butcher-Doctor</hi> to Sir <hi>R. Bovy,</hi>
labouring under a Quartan, and
by as many Purges (whereof the
least operated between forty and
fifty times) prescribed by a subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<hi>T—rd-Doctor,</hi> the Patient was
thrown into all the kinds of Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
with a continuation of the
Ague, notwithstanding the use of
the Jesuits Powder in all its forms
and quantities. From the Head
to the Toe a more monstrous oede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matous
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55231:9"/>
protuberance was scarce pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
his Belly so extreamly fill'd
with Water, and Wind especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that would have supported him
from sinking in any River; his
Age was almost decrepid, his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
little or nothing, and his
feebleness answerable to all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.
Those cathartick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
which the whole band of
Physick-men have, and do hitherto
erroneously depend on, would take
no place in a distemper they had
caused. Tapping must have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
speedily terminative.</p>
            <p>2. Through the use of Chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beats
variously mixt with Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
and Detersives, he was in few
Weeks reduced to his former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of Body, which was lean,
thin, and lank, his strength return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
with his appetite, and good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion;
nothing remained, but the
swelling of his Legs, though consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably
lessened, which was discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by a lixivial Fomentation. His
burden of Serosities I observed was
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55231:10"/>
daily lessened by large quantities
of Urine, and insensible Perspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The greatest trouble I found
at the beginning, in the cure of his
Ague, which was effected by a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not unusual. What could be
here successfully expected from
Steel, was attained in all its parts,
the sulphurous particles, in their
abstersis and diuretick offices, kept
even pace with the salin in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboratif
and restrictive, whereby
the Bowels were restored to their
pristin firmness, and compact tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the Humors reduced to
a mediocrity in substance, temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
and fluidity. But in a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
occasions Steel is observed to
be retrograde, through ignorance
of proper application to Bodies and
Diseases.</p>
            <p>3. Some few years past, a Lady
brought her Daughter from <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
side to <hi>London,</hi> accompanied
with her Doctor in ordinary, who
justified his Steel course by a sensless
recital of Authors, and other of his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55231:10"/>
Physick Companions, in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
thereby to procure her
<hi>Menstrua,</hi> to whose non-appearance
at their due times and seasons, he
imputed a <hi>Cachexia,</hi> and pale co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
that injured her Complexion.
Three Weeks or a Months pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
in that method had entirely
extinguish'd her Appetit, thrown
her into an Hectick Fever, and a
Cough so importune, that would
not suffer her scarce to breathe or
speak.</p>
            <p>4. The salts of her Humours
closing with the vitriolique of the
Steel, without loosning and unty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the sulphurous particles from
them, united their force of bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
drying, and damning up all
the Humours, that by regurgitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were impelled into the Lungs
and Bowels, which being now
choak'd up by such a cementing
Remedy, what was here to be done?
Nothing that I could think more
certain than a prognostic, that a
few days would put a period to her
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55231:11"/>
Life, and to the Steel course also.
This Ferrier-Doctor would needs
turn Ass-Doctor, and abandon his
Patient to Asses Milk, at <hi>Chelsey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
where in less than a week her hour-glass
was run out.</p>
            <p>5. Another case I remember of
a Merchant in <hi>London,</hi> whom a
<hi>Ferrier</hi> Physician pretending to cure
of a Chronical cough, that had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
him twelve or fourteen
years, pressed a solution of Steel
upon him thirty days or longer,
which indeed had much abated the
Cough, but also had render'd him
so hoarse, that a Mouse could not
have heard him speak, at a yards
distance, besides the loss of Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
and Strength. I advis'd the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
to take leave of his <hi>Ferrier</hi> and
his Steel, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nless he intended to stop
up his Lungs, and desist from
breathing. Much ado he regain'd
his old Cough, which being so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated,
a Cure ought never to be
attempted beyond palliation, and
upon a deterioration through a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55231:11"/>
new Cold, or addition of a recent
defluxion, beyond some lenifying
or smoothing pectorals, an old
Cough bearing the Office of a
Pump, or an Issue, which with the
superfluities of the Lungs, throws
out the Crudities of the whole mass,
the retention whereof would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
swell and choak these pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Bellows.</p>
            <p>So true it is, as some certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorals
are the life of the Lungs,
that Steel, and all chalybeat Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
are a certain bain unto them,
the roughness and adstringent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of its vitriolick Salt, which
they contain in a superlative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
straitning and contracting in
process of time the whole pneuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Engine to a total suppression.</p>
            <p>6. From the preceding Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph
flows naturally this obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that where Lungs are he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditarily
asthmatick, or adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
so, by universally inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
a thick smoaky foggy Air
about <hi>London,</hi> which from the drip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55231:12"/>
fits of the Climate in the
Winter, proves no other all <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
over; Steel Remedies either
in a dry or moist form, as Iron-waters,
and Syrup of Steel ought
to be regarded with a very squint
suspicious Eye, and never called in
use where the greatest necessity is
not the chiefest indicant.</p>

the mischiefs of Steel, with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            <p>1. NOW, if you will suppose
a Man or Woman afflicted
with any hypochondriac spleeny
Distemper, or inveterated obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Bowels, either being
easily incident into a Couch, and
being never so little imbecillitated
in their Lungs, a Steel Medicine
exhibited, where the acid within
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55231:12"/>
the Body is uncapable to divide
the <hi>Sulphur</hi> from the Salt, they run
no small risque of puiking their
gross slimy Humors into their
Lungs, that will in time coagulate
to an Asthma, ulcerous disposition
of the Lungs, and probably a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
and Hectic Fever; or
if peradventure the Humours do
not sublime, they will be compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into immedicable Obstructions,
and most obstinate Infarctions.
Where such Medicines encounter
with Youth, their Vigour possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
may subjugate their roughness,
and menaced Mischiefs, which in
those that are turned of forty, do
very frequently ensue, either soon
after, or upon a delay of a few
years, and may easily be tract back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to the Steel Original, whence
they will evidently be found to
take their source; neither are you
here to expect an enumeration
of all such like cases, which I
can give you, unless you are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with Patience of reading a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55231:13"/>
Treatise six times bigger, than
this will amount unto; neither can
I without astonishment behold,
how gredily Syrup of Steel is
swallowed down at <hi>Paris,</hi> by most
of the Patients of a noised <hi>Farrier-Doctor,</hi>
who in the failure of this,
doth immediately turn to Ass-Doctor,
by his milkie Diets; so
that I cannot tell, whether I ought
properly to say, the Farrier upon
the Ass, or the Ass upon the Farrier.</p>
            <p>2. Beyond all peradventure the
<hi>Sulphur</hi> of Steel being entirely stript
(as very few have hitherto yet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered)
of its saline particles, and
their restringent faculties, (which
in most preparations will in a great
measure cleave to it (must become
a most admirable deobstruent; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did I ever yet arrive to any
one process, that came near it,
except one, which by bringing it
over the Alembick, renders it solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
The same process hath the

some few other Minerals, which

at present.</p>
            <p>3. It is not on the Bowels only,
but on the Brain and Nerves, a
long or oft repeated Steel course
manifests its immedicable Injuries.
Palsies, Convulsions, and extream
weakness of the Joynts, I have
more than once observed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of it, which I can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
from no other preceding cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality,
then by cementing and
binding vicious humours in deep
latent recesses, where by a long
stagnation for some months, and
sometimes years, they acquire a
levain so pernicious, as to deprave
and subvert the animal Faculty,
enervating the whole systeme of
channels, that proceed from the
Brain, and impressing a virulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
on the Juyces of the Nerves;
in which manner, and through
the same means, it bears a very
near affinity to the Jesuits bark,
that hath so oft some years after
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55231:14"/>
caused Convulsions, and Syncopees;
though never <hi>Apoplectic-fits,</hi> a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
that makes Physicians
that used it, to appear the greatest
Block-heads; for Fits denote a type,
and a circuit of beginning, ending,
and returning, which an Apoplexy
never did. Either it is a strong
one, <hi>(Apoplexia fortis)</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and all other
experienced Physicians since, doth
infallibly kill; or slight, <hi>(Apoplexia
levis)</hi> which for the most part turns
to a Palsie. See <hi>Hippocr. Apho. lib. 2.
Aph. 42.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Imagine half a quier of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
of the same stampt treating
a Patient, decumbent of Leipothy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick,
or rather Syncopal fits, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchanging
reciprocally with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Convulsions, or (if you please)
spasmodic Paroxysms, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
prove periodical. These sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms,
which are evident to all the
World, what they are, being by
them termed <hi>Apoplectic-fits,</hi> (a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
never mentioned by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55231:14"/>
any Author since the Creation)
exposes them either to be grosly
ignorant, (as appears by what is
manifest before concerning an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy)
or very sinisterly design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if not in all, at least in the
<hi>Babylonian</hi> Leaders, whom the rest
easily will follow for large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations,
or to prevent being by
them kick'd out of so honourable
an Employ. It is probable, the
whole <hi>Chorus</hi> not arriving toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the first come, upon the sight
of such an effroyable symptom,
either being not sufficiently skilful,
or not taking time to examine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the case, might mistake it for
an Apoplexy, and too precipitant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
advise bleeding, to make room
in the Vessels for the Blood to
move, and consequently to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
stagnation, and coagulation.
Now I would put the question, a
Man, or Woman, being fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a swooning fit, Is there one
thoughtful Physician among five
hundred, that would have the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55231:15"/>
courage, or so little sense, as to
open a Vein? Did ever any authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Author in Physick prefer Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy
as a proper Remedy in
this case? If you reply, there may
be a Plethory; still not in one in a
thousand will consent to it in the
fit.</p>
            <p>5. To go on upon the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
supposition. I very well
know, that a Physician, to free
himself from the censure of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
or erroneous application of
a Remedy, will endeavour to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
himself, by inculcation, and
hammering his Sentiment into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of the Physicians called in,
upon their first arrival; who either
out of a Complement, or false con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the case communicated
unto them, or untrue relation of
the thing, or their proper igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and unskilfulness, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyed
or fallen into the same opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
are bound to justifie the first
Physician and themselves, and one
another, singly and joyntly; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55231:15"/>
being blinded by the first
appearance, they dare not, nor
will not hereafter see plain, lest
the standers by should accuse them
of hallucination. The Disease be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at first christned an Apoplexy,
they were obliged to hold to that
word; but going soon off, and
returning with interchanges of
Convulsions, they perceived plain
enough, that it was no Apoplexy;
but to conceal their mistake, they
judged it necessary to keep to the
first Notion, and slide it of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plectic
fits, a <hi>species</hi> of impudence
uncommon to any but themselves;
as if the Art of Physick and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
were circumscribed by the
walls of their Conclave, though
any man might with the least
glimps detect their error, gross be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
what could proceed from
Nurses, or meer Novices in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick.</p>
            <p>6. I have more than ten times
seen men otherwise very robust,
fall into deep swooning fits, lying
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55231:16"/>
a considerable time, as to outward
appearance, like unto dead, who
by frictio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of their Temples, vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications
of their Nostrils, dolorous
contortions of the Extremities, and
pouring down their throats strong
alexipharmacs, have usually reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
out of that fit, though soon
after, by translation of the subtil
matter to the Brain and Nerves,
have been tortured with a Spas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modic
fit, of no longer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
than the foresaid matter
could be discussed by volatil Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riticks,
or Cephalicks. These sorts
of Alternative fits, from their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for several years, possibly
for seven, ten, or twenty, more or
less, import no imminent danger,
unless attempted to be cured by
unseasonable bleedings, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
purges, by raising a mud of
dormant Humours, which either a
long chalybeat, or Jesuitical course,
had dammed up, and cemented.</p>
            <p>7. Besides the fore-mentioned
causes that are the most frequent,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55231:16"/>
it's indubitable, that the like Fits
may owe their growth to reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
debauches, inveterate obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
(whereby Humors may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
a virulency) and poisonous
Minerals and Vegetables, which
exert their activity in much shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dimension of time.</p>
            <p>8. In the fore-mentioned imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Patient, the first bleeding not
being exempted from a just cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
may plead a pardon from
the possiblity of a mistake of the
Disease, by the surprize, and from
the force of the Argument alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that a bleeding, by making
room in the Vessels, and accelera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
circulation, doth prevent the
Blood in stagnating. But that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
being answered by a first
larger bleeding, or a first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
mediocre depletion, to what
end o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> purpose is in the former a
second, third, and fourth (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
one or two may be in the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars,
which is never performed
without a great risque) advised in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55231:17"/>
large proportions, and some of
them in the Syncopal fit? from
matter of fact is desumed an <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum
ad hominem,</hi> Bleeding very
oft, though administred for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
only in robust, and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Bodies, doth upon the stopping
of the Blood throw them into a
long and deep swooning, or Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothymick
fit, whence it has been
observed some never returned. So
that nothing is more naturally
conclusive, if bleeding out of the
Arm, or Jugulars, doth frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
precipitate an healthy strong
man into a Swooning, or Leipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymy,
it must necessarily force a
weak Patient, who already doth
labour under a strong Leipothy my
or (which is worse) Syncopal fit,
many degrees nearer to his End.
Waving the Experimental, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the <hi>Rational,</hi> granting the first
bleeding, especially it large, doth
by making room, promote and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate
the motion of the blood
universally, whereby a stagnation
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55231:17"/>
is repell'd, and a free perspiration
procured. The second bleeding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausting
the vital, and mediately
the animal Spirits, the third more,
and the fourth yet more, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
must necessarily more and
more be lessened, and impeded,
through want of Spirits (for it is
the Spirits, that are the <hi>impetum sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientes,</hi>
and impulsors of motion
within the Vessels) and warmth.
Moreover, through the subsiding,
and paucity of the Spirits, the pores
are constricted, Perspiration im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and the virulent Steems, that
occasion all the mischief, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unsubdued, by their minutely
accessions, must inevitably become
conquerours of Life, as sundry ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
do exhibit unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
testimonies, and against matter
of Fact all argumentations will be
found sophistical. Upon a replique
may be pretended, that the scope,
intentions, or indications for bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
besides the abating of Pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
are revulsion, and derivation;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55231:18"/>
and secundarily or <hi>per accidens</hi> cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
removing of pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You
must apprehend, that the indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for bleeding have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
chiefly to the antecedent cause,
and seldom have any influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the conjunct, unless <hi>per accidens</hi>
and secundarily; but in reference
to virulent Steems, or venomous
Humors, whereunto those that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
the oft fore-mentioned Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms,
are analogal, if not really
such, bleeding upon any supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can never be put into use
more than once, and scarce that.
For instance, will you dare to
bleed in a malign Fever after
the beginning, or in the Plague?
Suppose a man hath swallowed
<hi>Arsenic,</hi> sublimate, or any other
sort of Poyson, or is fallen into
Convulsions by a poysonous steem,
can you pretend to bleed in this
case? I could heartily wish Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
did abstract such Theorems,
or Maxims from observation, (the
highest Form in the School of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick)
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55231:18"/>
that would serve as Rules,
whence to take true measures for
the necessity, season, number and
quantity of bleeding, and not to
advise Phlebotomy at random, as
most of 'em do.</p>
            <p>9. Suppose besides the third and
fourth bleeding of the imaginary
Patient, there is by a party Jury of
Butcher-Doctors, and T—rd-Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,
a smart Vomit given, and

in Brandy, (vulgarly called <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctura

Morning, for several days together,
in a body by such repeated losses of
Blood reduced to a low ebb of
strength, and the Spirits harassed
and tortured by the return of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorated
Syncope's and Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
Vomits, and chiefly sharp
fermentative Aloetics so oft repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
all these must rake up the last
remainder of the virulent Mud,
and stir up with a violence the
most latent Impurities, which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55231:19"/>
without those disturbances might
have continued their quiet for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years. Such outragious Assaults,
battering the Spirits and Humors

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55231:20"/>
consideration, 1. That Steel in its
best shape is the greatest Enemy to
some particular Constitutions. 2.
That tincture of Tartar is a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
universally agreeing with
all Temperaments, where resera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Oppilations is the indication.
3. That the want of Success of this
Medicine, and others of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
efficacy, is to be attributed to
the underdosing of it, in the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of six, eight, or ten drops,
whereas I seldom give less than
half a spoonful, and sometimes
more, diluted with a sufficient mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of a temperate Vehicle, in
the imitation of which you shall
seldom or never miss of your aim,
or be frustrated of your Exspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance.
4. That the common <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of Tartar</hi> is an exaltation of
the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of Spirits of Wine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
through the adurent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of a most forcibly calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
Salt of Tartar, imbibing
but very little of the Salin parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
through want of phleme in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55231:20"/>
the Spirit. 5. That the Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
next subscribed, being partly a
Tincture, and partly a Solution of
Salt of Tartar, is virtuated with
an abstersif quality, derived from
lixivial, slippery, or soapy parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Salt, whereby it's ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
a most excelling deobstruent,
and ought to be preferred before
the other, by as much, as it is of a
far easier preparation, that may
be finish'd with less toil, and in
shorter time, which processes I
have ever aimed at upon all other
materials, well knowing, that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious
and multiplied changes of
the form of things by distillation,
sublimation, calcination, and other
various fiery tortures, doth very
oft destroy the nature of the thing,
intended to be thereby exalted in
Vertues, or corrected in Qualities.
2. Take two or three Ounces of
well calcin'd Salt of Tartar, pour
on it as much good Cognack Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or spirit of Wine not rectified,
as will over-cover it six <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

then decant it, this is all;
hereof give a Spoonful, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
more in an apt Vehicle,
Mornings and Evenings. 3. The
nauseous tast of the Salt, though
by this simple is much abated, yet
is not entirely taken off, which
may be easily performed in the
Calcination of the Salt; but it doth
somewhat impoverish its Vertue.
By such a clean sort of Medicine
joyn'd with an Equipollent, can be
attained in a very short interval of
Time, what can scarce be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by half yard long Apozems
of the opening Roots, capillar

            <p>1. IT is not the least craft in the
Ass-Doctors, where they spy
a wasting of the Flesh, to term it
a Consumption, which hapning
to be an attendant almost to every
Disease, hastens Patients to flock in
numbers to such Physicians; and
that direful word carrying a dread
in its signification, doth not a little
multiply their Ass Practice, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when they so highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the Credit of a milk Diet,
by noising it to be the sole grand
sweetner of the Blood.</p>
            <p>2. Sure I am, the Death of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
may be justly attributed to
their Confidence in Asses Milk, in
contempt of all such Remedies, or
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55231:22"/>
Medicines, that were proper for
the Cure of their Diseases. These
Dietetick <hi>Fourbs,</hi> or <hi>Bonny-Clabber</hi>
Physicians, are deservedly censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Criminal, for not rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the nature of Milk, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a food the most convertible into
any vicious Humor, that's most
abounding. In hot cholerick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases,
it's readily assimilated to
Choler, renders the heat of Fevers
more burning, a Head-ach less sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable,
a drought more difficult
to be quench'd; in hot Stomachs
waxes nidorulent, and in many its
very corruptible, coagulable, or
curdly. Phlegmatick Diseases re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from it an addition of slime,
the Stone and Gravel derive their
nourishment and increase from it.
Palsies, Drowsiness, Blindness, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarhs
and Rhumes have oft follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Milk Diet. With a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Constitution it harmonies best.
To cure so many various Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
as is pretended by a milkie
Diet, is as impossible, as by it to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55231:22"/>
reinstall a dis-joynted Limb, or to
cement broken Bones. An Ulcer in
the Lungs, with a contemporary
Hectick Fever, and Consumption,
can no more be cured by an Ass-milkie
Diet, than a Capon be
roasted in the bottom of the
Thames. This may be credited,
that many emaciated Persons, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded
with a Cough, have
been restored to a plump habit of
Body by Asses Milk, diluting the
Salts of their blood, that prey'd
upon the carnous parts, through
the abounding <hi>Serum</hi> of the Milk,
and smoothing the roughness of
the said Salts by its butyrous or
oyly Particles; and in regard of
its soft tender caseous parts, it is
easier assimilated, than the stringy
or fibrous Juyces of Flesh-meat. In
conclusion, he that cannot cure an
Ulcer of the Lungs, with an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick,
and Consumption attending,
without Asses Milk, in less than
two Months, doth not deserve the
Name of a Physician. As for the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55231:23"/>
Hectick Fever, what they general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
assert incurable, it certainly goeth
off with the consolidation of the
Ulcer, without making use of any
<hi>Anti-Hectick.</hi> Whether the Ass-Patient,
or the Ass-Doctor be the
greater Ass, is easily decided by
those, that have met with <hi>Athenaeus</hi>'s
Saying, a <hi>Graecian</hi> Philosopher,
translated by <hi>Scìopius, exceptis Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis

there is the greatest want of Blood,
the substracting of which would
probably abbreviate a Months Life,
more or less, to a week or a few
hours. The T-rd-men, except
those that are very far advanc'd
in Impudence, do exulate in the
use of their Purges, which would
extreamly promote a loosness, a
Symptom they are commonly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
into; and hapning, soon
destroys, by stopping the Cough,
and suppressing expectoration, the
immediate fore-runner of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantancous
Suffocation. Steel Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
and the Jesuits Bark, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a stop also to Expectoration, as
hath been objected before, are a
bar to Ferriers, and Jesuitical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.
Neither can the Dull-head
Physicians come into play, with
their Aquarius, being contrary to
all Expectoration. So that, as there
is an Art of curing by Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
there is also an Art of killing
by Expectation; for he that is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Consumptive through an
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55231:24"/>
Ulcer in his Lungs, by daily and
weekly Expectation in vain, of
amendment from a Milkie Diet,
neglects such means as might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
conduce to his Cure, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
at last makes forfeiture of his
Life to the Art of Expectation.
Syrups, Lohochs, Lozenges, and
the like, do under no other noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fallaciously deserve the name
of Pectorals, than by their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
smoothing of the roughness
of the <hi>oesophagus</hi> or Gullet, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
by nearness or affinity of parts
it doth sympathise with the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe,
or <hi>aspera arteria.</hi> This seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ease lasteth no longer, than
a fresh emanation of saline Rheum,
or Slyme out of the Glanduls wipes
off the clammy Syrup; where, and in
the Stomach the <hi>Rheum</hi> by its sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and a vicious ferment (as they
term it) converts that, or any such
Saccharaceous Medicine, into a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding
Acid, which is so far from
being auxiliary against the Ulcer
upon its arrival to the Lungs, that it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55231:24"/>
excavates the Ulcer, and by sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
duplicates the Cough.
It cannot be contradicted, but that
Honey in any pectoral Medicine
used instead of Sugar, especially
<hi>Narbon</hi> Honey, may contain a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
answerable in some small
measure the Indications of an Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
in the Lungs; because it seems
to be an extract of the Balsamick
Particles of fragrant oleous Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that probably may arrive to
the Lungs, without being intirely
broken in their Vertues.</p>
            <p>4. I am not ignorant, that vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerary
Herbs, as ground Ivy, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
Mantle, Bugle, and many
others, used in Decoctions, are in
high esteem among several Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick-men,
who do very confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attribute to them the cure of
divers Consumptions. But I am
also very well assured, that those
Vegetables, though supposed to be
sufficiently impowred for the cure
of Ulcers, must in their passage
through the Stomach and Bowels,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55231:25"/>
and mixture with the Humors,
receive such impressions and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
as strip them of their facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and energy, before they can
traverse to the Vessels of the
Lungs. What can be most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably
construed on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
is, that some who have been
much emaciated, and at the same
time accompanied with a Cough
of an old date, whence they have
been erroneously pronounced Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptives,
did receive amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or a Cure from them; but
then it is to be conceived, here
was no Ulcer of the Lungs, nor
Hectick Fever, nor little Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthumes,
nor putrid affection of
the Lungs, which in a proper
fense specifie a Consumption strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so called. In a putrid affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Lungs, its not to be
doubted, but what is expectorated,
is slyme mixt with purulent Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
generated in the retired Pores
of that Entrail, through a long
Stagnation, which occasions an
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55231:25"/>
Hectick Fever, and a Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that is so universal to this
Island, and which neither Milk
Diet, nor vulnerary Decoction,
though sufficiently saccharated, or
mellified; nor pectoral Syrups,

               </gap>hs, nor Lozenges, did ever
cure, but inevitably kill by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
there being but one
Medicine, far different from the
forementioned, that is impowered
to answer all the Indications of a
proper pulmonick Consumption.
From the tonsure Remedy, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Notwithstanding the avidity
of their perquisites over-poysing,
the greatest prejudice their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriac,

of boyling them half away, or
converting of 'em into Posset, or
rather a curdy sort of Soupe.
What ever ease and solace the

washing and rensing of their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
urinary Passages, and Guts,
of floaty Humors for the present,
the continuance by a potent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction,
wedges and impacts (as
I said before) the slymy feculen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
into very stubborn Clogs,
which can no otherwise be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
then by interposing alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Purges, respondent to the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of the Disease, morbifick
Causes, and other Circumstances.</p>
            <p>2. Gravel and Stone are to be
considered either in their fits of
pain, diminution, and suppression
of Urine; or when unmoved, the
the Patient is free of those Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.
To exhibite Waters of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55231:27"/>
one kind or other in the times of
misery, is to irritate and press those
disturbant Causes to a greater fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and increase of Pains, and
sometimes of total suppression of
Urine. Pains thus augmented, and
continued, invite Inflammations
and Fevers, which in very many
prove Quarter-masters of Death.
The Urine suppressed for six or
seven days, turns to a fatal Drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
and <hi>Coma,</hi> or Lethargy, to
which always a Fever is annext.
Purges are equally obnoxious to
the same Evils, and therefore ought
very carefully to be avoided. A
course of Waters slabber <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d down
out of the fit, by carrying off a
loose <hi>mucus,</hi> detruding floating thin
Impurities, and by locking up and
compacting the grosser Humors,
do undoubtedly very much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the interval of fits, tye up
Pains, and prevent the quick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of the Symptoms forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned;
but by this means, the clog
of those gross saline humors is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorated
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55231:27"/>
into immedicable, and
the Stone so aggrandized, that
throwing the Patient into a worse
fit than ever, kills him. So that
the sum of all is, that waters are
impowred to grant an easie Life,
and a short one; and so contrary
to the cure of the Stone, that they
do not so much as prevent the
growth of it, unless it be during
the time of the course they drink
them; which appears by this, that
the next fit a man falls into after
his course of waters, is ordinarily
worse, than any he felt before.</p>
            <p>3. That the dissolving and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Stone in the Bladder, or
Kidneys, is within the sphere of
Activity of Medicines, is a belief,
that in improbability equals the
highest fiction of Poetry. To break
a Diamont, supposed to lye upon
the ball of the Eye, by force of
hammer, expresses a <hi>modus faciendi,</hi>
or manner how it may be done
imaginatively; but to reduce into
crumbs, gritt, and powder, a hard

and yet the powers of the Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking
Medicines meet with such
Credit in Physicians, that beyond
possibility they most impudently
assert matter of fact, performed by
them daily upon those, that are
troubled with the Stone. Well

they continue in the use of them

not yoke with them in their Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick

infer themselves absolute Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors

            <p>5. This may be received for
great Truth, that the procatarc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
internal antecedent, effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
material, and adjuvant Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
being substracted and redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and that course continued to
a great length of time, by defect
of sabulous nourishment, and not
being cherish'd, Nature by help of
its Spirits and restored ferment (as
they term it) will convert the
hardest and biggest Stone into a
mouldering, (provided by Age,
and decay of the Bowels the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
be not reduced too low) which
perceived, the excretory passages
require to be well relax'd, and
rendred slippery by mucilaginous
Emollients, and afterwards to be
stimulated gently and gradually
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55231:30"/>
by some diureticks, to throw off
the gritt. And this is the only
certain, and secure method of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that hitherto incurable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease.
The Earl of <hi>C.</hi> now deceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
some years since was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tormented with a sharp pain
about a hand breadth above the
groin, his easiest posture was ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on his Bed. To his Quality
and great pain were mostly suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
five or six great Physicians;
one might as congruously say six
great Magots, or six great Mites,
people very improperly attributing
the word Great to a thing so little
and mean as an Expectation C.
Physician; scarce one in twenty
knowing the tithe of what he has
forgotten, and what he still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
is scarce worth knowing.
The little success that attended
their Prescriptions, convinced his
Lordship of their scauty Judgment,
which proved as various as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true,
the one insinuating the pain
to be a Cholick from Wind, the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55231:31"/>
other an Ulcer; the other this,
and another that. At last I had
the Honour of having the cure
of his Lordship committed to my
care; upon no long examination
of the matter, I assured his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the pain in that part of his
Belly was occasioned by an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
small Stone, that stuck in
the <hi>Vreter,</hi> whereunto, being a long
time prepossest with the false Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of his late chashier'd phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
Doctors, he was very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to give Credit, expressing
that none of his Predecessors had
ever been troubled with a Disease,
that proves so commonly Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
nor himself had ever dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
the least sign of Gravel;
moreover that a Kinsman of his
had lately been afflicted with a
pain in the same part, that was
evidenced to be caused by Wind,
from the carminative (wind-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
Remedies, that entirely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed
it. I replyed <hi>Artifici in sua
Arte Credendum,</hi> and that the event
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55231:31"/>
would infallibly demonstrate the
truth of the thing. I kept this
Noble Patient to a very thin Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
a long time, and used Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
answerable to the Method,
and Indications above mentioned,
which in conclusion discharged
five or six Stones, about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a Pea, sometimes one,
othertimes two in a day; from
their colour and rough outside,
they notified to be affalls and large
crumblings of a greater Stone,
formed in the Kidneys, and thro'
substracting from its growth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of cherishment, and through
correcting of its causes was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

to the hands of the Lithotomist, in
case such a quarry be discovered,
the certification of the conception
and growth of the Stone must
inevitably intail upon him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
fear and anguish, whereof
he is not like to be freed, before

Fellow of the Town, whose Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Reputation was his sole Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card,
whereby to gain so extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
a point.</p>
            <p>2. Since length of time, with
the assistance of assured Remedies,
pointed at by those demonstrable
Indications above written, will cure
a Patient of the Stone, and that
any other Disease, that may be
mistaken for it, be curable by the
same means, to what end shall a
search by <hi>Catheter</hi> be made; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when that sort of explora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the stop of the Instrument
at the narrowness of the <hi>Sphincter,</hi>
so render'd by swelling, a callosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or a small carnosity, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
so oft fallacious to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that men have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55231:33"/>
to be cut, where no Stone
was, or ever had been; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
passed the dread and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Operation, were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to run the risque of a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
Cure of the Wound, that
seldom is performed without a
remainder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of a perpetual leaking,
and difficulty of miction, and
very oft with the loss of Life.
Moreover, where probing hath
detected no Disease in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
it frequently hath caused one,
<hi>viz.</hi> Inflammation of the <hi>Sphincter,</hi>
bloody Urine, Excoriations, Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
continual gleets by injuring
the prostates, and involuntary micti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
strangury, dysury, total sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of Urine, and almost all
Diseases incident to the Bladder
and Yard, not omitting those
that Death hath ensued. On the
other hand, the uncertainty of the
<hi>Catheter</hi> and <hi>Itinerary</hi> is no less evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in those that really having a
Stone fixt in a part, where that
Tool not reaching, or having pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55231:33"/>
thro' a Stone, whose softness
made no resistance, hath imposed
on the Surgeon a fallacy of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the Patients were free.</p>
            <p>3. There is no case wherein the
use of the <hi>Catheter</hi> can rationally
be justified, except in a total sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of Urine, occasioned ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by <hi>Mucus,</hi> crumbs of blood,
or Stone being loosned and fallen
to the neck of the Bladder, and
the like occasions, to let out that
liquid Excrement by removing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
obstacle.</p>
            <p>4. The Stone grown moveable
by being forced from its fastness
by probings (as too oft has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
violent motions, vomiting,
purging, potent diureticks, and by
its own weight or bigness, is the
only argument, that ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with the Patient, to surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
himself to the doubtful suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of Stone-cutting; for the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santure
of a Stone of compass,
will ever incline it to return to
the same place of declination,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55231:34"/>
where it occasioned the former
suppression, unless by lying still in
bed so long, as by peradventure
is required to be reattached to the
side of the Bladder, from which
it was torn off, it be prevented;
so that the pretences of Gravel-Surgeons,
in removing the Stone
from the mouth of the Bladder
by <hi>Catheter,</hi> to give passage to the
Urine that stops by fits, where
there is a long interval of time
between, is a most ignorant and
impudent cheat, the Stone in those
cases being always firmly fixt to
the side of the Bladder, and a
suppression of that kind is ever
occasioned by <hi>Mucus,</hi> Gravel, and
the like causes. True, the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
may notwithstanding some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
perceive a Stone, which the
posture or manner of decumbiture
in the Patient, or swelling of that
side of the Bladder, may bring nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to the entrance of the <hi>Sphincter,</hi>
the touching of which with his
Tool, (the <hi>Catheter</hi> and the <hi>Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:55231:34"/>
within it) gives him that
false apprehension, that he moved
the Stone, (which in that case is
the greatest nonsense and stupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
imaginable) for in all persons
the Stone is ever fixt in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and its growth, and never
becomes loose or moveable, but
where the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>its of suppression return
almost every moment; and the
attachment of the Stone to the
side of the Bladder is so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
that by reason thereof, many
have been discovered to have
lodged a Stone many years, and
probably all their Life-time, upon
the dissection of their bodies after
death, who whilst living were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
sensible, or suspicious of such
a preternatural growth. Though
Ignorance and Knavery are so he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
to most, that are appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances
and giblets of the Art of
Physick; yet these Operators for
the Stone (who commonly by
reason of their desperate misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
are forced to be Renegades
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55231:35"/>
and Mountebancks) contain those
qualities in the highest abstract.</p>
            <p>5. A strangury; and difficulty of
Urine, proceding in a lesser stream
than usual, have frequently driven
several into erroneous apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the Stone, being occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a glutinous <hi>Mucus,</hi> through
stagnation and adhesion, contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a smart stimulating acrimony,
that has drawn humors towards
the <hi>Sphincter,</hi> whereby from an
intumescence both a narrowness
of the passage, or weakness of the
discharging faculty, and an irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to Urine, have ensued; the
latter specifying a strangury, and
the two former symptoms a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.
In neither of these purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or diureticks have been found
advantageous, but detrimental, so
that these Pispot-Doctors to this
hour have continued disarmed of
proper Remedies to oppose them.</p>

by it, where necessarily it
hath been administred. In the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination

Fits, inveterate Hypochondriacks,
Fluxes of the Belly, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
towards the middle of Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic

at ten days interval one

be wrested from me. The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

expressed their Condolance, by
sending Physicians in esteem with
them. The Ferrier-Doctor durst

A little after a Butcher-Doctor,
whom the vogue reported to be in
his usual exaltations every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before Nine of the Clock, by
drinking his Masters Health, would
needs have introduced a bleeding,
which inevitably would have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
the Farrier's prediction.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55231:36"/>
However, his pains were intirely
removed in eight days, in a frosty
snowy Season, by a Medicine the
most uncommon, and the Patient
restored to Health, protracted to
this hour. This observation is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
adduced to expose the bestiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Physicians in their bleeding
and bloodshed in Chronic Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
in Persons advanced in years,
beyond forty and fifty, the error
whereof I can attest to have been
the sole cause of the death of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

are obvious to those, whom ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation

and evil effects of bleeding. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

where bleeding and purging have
no prevalance, the Conclave Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician

malignant Fevers, and many other
Diseases have invaded sound bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,

concession the vulgar of Physicians
do acquiesce in. So that, if the

means (or <hi>media</hi>) by altering,

of the Brain (the animal Spirits)
to their pristin form, and order of

all which is so aptly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

that the Patient shall be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

a strong impression on the
sick mans Phansie, and inordinate
motions, the fury of the animal
Spirits (which are frequently cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Diseases) are allayed and
appeased; which being daily pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued,
is the undoubted means, the
Art of Expectation uses; whereas,
as shall hereafter be rendred plain
in various instances, what is mark'd
down in his Serowls, or <hi>Recipe's,</hi>
can conduce no more to recovery
of health, than <hi>a Laplanders</hi> charm
to procure a fair Wind: and that
which adds extreamly to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
strong impression, is the
gravity, port, pretended Learning,

Physician, and Undertaker.</p>
            <p>3. To know the probability, or
capacity of the pretensions, and
performances of an Artist, by the
dimension; number, and quality
of his Tools, is a matter of no
great difficulty; and considering
the nature of a Razor, you may
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55231:38"/>
easily believe it probable, that a
Barber is capable of shaving you.
My next business therefore is, to
examine the box of Tools of the
Physician, which is the Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
or <hi>Pharmacopoea,</hi> that for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and quality exceeds the tools of
an hundred Artists, I may well
say, of all that are in <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi>
and <hi>Africa,</hi> there being nothing
under the Earth, on it, or above
it, or what is contained in all the
Elements, even the Elements, and
what is consistent of them, but
what is registred there, or at least
belongs to it. There is <hi>Iapan</hi> Earth,
<hi>Armenia, Lemnia, Tripoli, Strigonia</hi>

number of Remedies are indefinite,
so Diseases should be proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in number; and what strange

were he to be subject to more
thousands of Diseases, than a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians

A Monkey having caught a Louce,
should he bring a Chain to tye his
Legs, a Hatchet, a Saw, a Knife,
a Mallet, and twenty Instruments
more to cut off his Head, it would
seem a very unusual farce; but far
more ridiculous is it, to see a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician

and Earth contains, to resist and
expell those few morbific causes,
that occasion all the Diseases of
man. And the Apothecary should
he in obedience to the Physicians

2. This Julep consisting of six
simple Waters, and prescribed pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siby
by six silly Conclave-Doctors,
in consult (for every one will put
in his water) to contemperate the
heat of a Fever, is exactly parallel
with the following prescript of
Cookery.</p>
            <p>3. Suppose a Conference of six
Cooks for making a good <hi>Soupe,</hi>
whose order is, to take of Thames<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
fetch'd from <hi>Hammersmith,</hi> of
Lambs-Conduit-water, of New-River-water,
and of <hi>Hide-park-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
of each one quart; of Well-water,
and Rain-water from <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed,</hi>
(where the Air is clear, and
not smoaky) of each one pint, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
one might very well imagine these
Cooks broke loose out of <hi>Bedlam,</hi>
to meet about their <hi>Soupe,</hi> or at
least, their Superstitious Criticism
exceeded the greatest folly of men
in their choice of <hi>Hammersmith-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
lest being too near the disim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogue
of the Thames, it might
conceal some brackishness, derived
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55231:43"/>
from the nearness of commerce with
the Sea. And that from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
of many various waters
might result such an occult Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
as should contribute an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
extraordinary, is a noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so exactly square with our
Physick-men, expecting from the
jumble of those waters, what was
not in the power of any one of
them being single; though in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
the difference, if any may be
conceived, is less between them,
than between <hi>Thames—water</hi> and
<hi>Hide-park-water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The distilling those Waters
from Herbs, growing in a good
soil and healthful Air, and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the New of the Moon, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
through a good Sign, two or
three hours, precisely after Sun
rising, is perhaps a piece of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense,
surpassing the crazie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of those Water-Cooks.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more commonly and
daily prescribed by most Physicians
in Fevers, than such sorts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leps,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55231:43"/>
interchanging those Waters
as variously, as Ringers do <hi>Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>-Bells;</hi>
and yet nothing is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
then that River-water being
once distilled, doth equallize, if not
surmount any of them, either for
a Vehicle, or Contemperation;
even thin Grewel (to avoid the
trouble of distillation) made of
Oat-meal or Perl-barley, may make
an equal poize with either of them.
And here may be moved a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a rich Patient rewarding six
Physicians with six G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>neas, for
consulting about six simple Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
whether he be the greater
fool, according to the old saying,
<hi>A Fool and his Money, &amp;c.</hi> or the
Doctors the greater Knaves?</p>
            <p>5. Pusillanimity, and fear of
Death, being oft the effects of a
Diminution, and Subversion of the
Animal Spirits in great Diseases,
may influence the wisest of men,
to reach out their hands to a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of any thing, that bears the
resemblance of help, and for that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55231:44"/>
reason his surpassing profusion to
a Physician, may be censured ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a surprize upon his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
A Physician on the other
hand, excuses his acceptance of
immoderate Fees, by the vulgar
Saying, <hi>That nothing is freer than
Gift;</hi> however it's left to your
Judgment, whether his slighting
of a Patient by negligent Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
short and seldom Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
doth not put an Extorsion
upon him in the exchange of his
reasonable Gratuites into extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant

I must represent a Scheme to
you of the Candor and physical
Conscience, Honesty or Generosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or what else it may be termed
of six Physicians, who they are,
and of what quality, where and
when to be found; you may be
informed by the perusal of their
printed Advertisement, very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously
distributed among most
Coffee-houses, and Street-walkers,
by some of themselves, and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
thereunto authorized. Behold
then the true Copy. <hi>viz. Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Physicians of the Colledge,
that us'd to consult twice a Week, for
the benefit of the sick, at the Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-house,
at the</hi> Carv. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>in</hi> Kingst. <hi>near</hi> Gld-hall, <hi>meet now
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55231:45"/>
four times a Week; and therefore give
publick notice, That on</hi> Mondays,
Wednesdays, Thursdays, <hi>and</hi> Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,
<hi>from two in the Afternoon till
Six, they may be advised with by the
known poor, and meaner Families for
nothing; and that the Expectations
and Demands from the middle Rank;
shall be moderate: but as for the Rich,
and Noble, Liberality is inseparable
from their Quality and Breeding.</hi> Have
you any work for a Cooper? Here
lives a Wyer-drawer. To the best
of my remembrance, I have met
with some Doctors Bills, <hi>viz. Trigs,
Tetramagogons, Fletchers, Nendicks, &amp;c.</hi>
which have been more ample and
significant, giving a Catalogue, of
what Diseases they pretend to cure,
as <hi>principaliter,</hi> Pox not always got
by Women, Meagrim, Gout, Stone,
<hi>principaliter,</hi> Scurvey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Further
they advertise you, they are to be
spoken with every day, from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the Morning, until six at
Night, a sign they are much more
industrious, than those worthy
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55231:45"/>
Gentlemen, who seem to keep ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Saturday,</hi> and not to labour,
neither they, nor their Ass, nor
their Ox; but what shall the
known poor, and meaner Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
do, or where shall they apply
themselves, that fall sick on <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days?</hi>
And what will the Doctors
do for Money to buy a Sheeps-head
for the <hi>Sunday?</hi> though notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
I presume, the Rich and
the Noble shall be very welcome
on <hi>Saturdays,</hi> and <hi>Tuesdays</hi> too.
And suppose, a man is Noble,
and not Rich, there I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
Liberality is separable from
his Quality and Breeding; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will you send him, <hi>ad Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num?</hi>
But set the case, a man is
both Rich and Noble, he will
possibly chose too send for a Noble
Doctor, or a rich Coach-Doctor,
and not give himself the trouble
to hunt for a Peripatetick Doctor
seven miles off; neither are there
many Noble men within the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts
of their Diocess. They say
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55231:46"/>
the known poor, How shall they
know any man to be poor? There
is none poor, but the poor Devil,
he shall have advice <hi>Gratis.</hi> For
nothing! a very proportionable
Reward, for nothing but Advice,
<hi>ex nihilo nihil fit;</hi> but I hope the
meaner Families, and the poor,
shall pay for their Medicines,
wherein it's presumed, Mr. Doctors
will find their Account. After all,
here is a plain Contradiction, to
pretend to give Advice for nothing,
and to set up the sign of an <hi>Angel</hi>

aloud upon two queries.
What shall the Shoomakers Wife

What will your Doctorship have

avowed, that the fond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern

of an umbragious assistance,
throw a man oft into a Precipice
of a certain Death, attended with
scorn and contempt of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by fastning his hopes upon
some brazen Physician or other,
an instance whereof we have the

and Chancellor of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of <hi>Montpelier</hi>) perceiving
the Kings fear of death, and his
sollicitousness for recovery, had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
this question from him,
whether he could cure him? <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,</hi>
a man of little Learning, and
elevated to this high post in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55231:53"/>
by the Favour and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
answered him yes, provided he
would solely intrust him; and in
doing so he would do much better,
in regard the other Physicians did
not know his temperament so well
as he; for as to him, ever since he
had been in his Service, he had
studied nothing, but to know his
Constitution, and that the others
did not much regard that, and did
not acquit themselves of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
minding nothing but to enrich
themselves, desiring the King not
to reveal to the others the advice
which he gave him. But as to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that he would be constantly
near his Person, searching by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
Readings, at the hours of
his leisure, among the Ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
Remedies for his Sickness.
And the more he thought on his
Disease, the more difficulty he
found to cure it. Also that he had
successfully served the King several
times, and that without him he
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55231:53"/>
had not been alive, for as much as
the other Physicians had oft or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
him Purges, and other strong
and violent Medicines, and that he
alone had privately corrected their
Prescriptions. He did further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
him, to command that no
body should come into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
hence forward, without the
leave of the foresaid <hi>Cottier,</hi> and by
this means did secure the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Kings Person to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>3. And to insinuate better thence
forward into the Kings Favour,
he did confederate himself with
<hi>Olivier Ie Dain</hi> his Barber, but a man
very ignorant, though the King
was much advised by him. This
Barber confirmed the King in what
the Physician had told him, and
by the same means he put the
Apothecary in ordinary in disfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
having reported to the King,
that he never had good Drugs,
whereby he was cashier'd with a
great deal of disgrace. Saith <hi>Luis
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55231:54"/>
Guion</hi> (from whom, and <hi>Iean de
Serres</hi> this Relation is extracted)
one may easily see how Princes
very often are subject to be deceived
by false Reports.</p>
            <p>4. The King grew so shagrin,
that when they had brought little
Lyons from <hi>Africa,</hi> which he had
expresly sent for, he would never
see them. One day among the rest
the King was peevish, and took a
fansie to discharge one that waited
upon him in his Chamber, because
he had given him warm Ptisan to
drink, and said angerly, that he
did not only discharge him, but
all the Officers of his House. And

comprehended among them, but I
do assure you, swearing a great
Oath, that after I am gone, you
will not live eight days, and this
will be found true. The King was
so frightned with the words of this
man, that from thence forward he
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55231:54"/>
put all, both his Person, and his
Kingdom, and all that he had,
into the Power of the said Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and would no more see, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Children, nor Wife, to
which his Physician had contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
very much.</p>
            <p>5. A great Gentleman of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne,</hi>
who was called <hi>Cortenay,</hi>
had committed two Murders, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Court to procure a Pardon,
obtained it by the Intercessions this
Physician made to the King. The
Chancellor then having refused to
feal this Pardon, being granted
against all Equity; which being
come to the Kings knowledge, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Seals to be brought to him,
and made the Physician <hi>Cottier</hi> Lord
Keeper of the Seals, and the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
was sent home with a great
deal of disgrace.</p>
            <p>6. It hapned, that for ten or
twelve days this new Chancellor
received but little money by the
Seals, whereof he made his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
to the King, who was sick,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55231:55"/>
that he got nothing, in regard he
never stir'd from him, and that
he used to get a great deal of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
by Consultations and Visits he
made to the sick, before he was
confined to be always near him,
and that he pray'd him to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of that, and of his Merits.
This King who believed that his
Life did entirely depend upon this
Physician, fearing that he would
abandon him, made his Privy
Purse <hi>(Thresorier de l'espargne)</hi> give
him in ready money fifty four
thousand Crowns, (which in those
days was as much as six or seven
hundred thousand Crowns now)
and should have had much more,
if more had been found in his
Coffers, for looking after him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
five Months. <hi>Mezeray,</hi> as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
agrees in the same Sum
of Money. Moreover, he caused
to be given unto his Nephew the
Bishoprick of <hi>Amiens,</hi> and all his
Friends and Relations were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
with brave and great Estates,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55231:55"/>
such as he liked best. The King
being sick, let him do what he
would, and durst not contradict
him in any wise.</p>
            <p>7. The King grew so thin and
dried up, that he seemed to be
rather a Skeleton, than a man, and
all through the ignorance of this
Physician; for his dry Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Body ought to have been moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and moderately warmed by
Nourishment, as well as Medicines;
and whereas he usually ask'd for
Wine, and boild Capon, this
wretched Physician would never
allow him any, though neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
very proper for his Health.
<hi>Mezeray</hi> tells you, that by his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
advice, he used to be bathed
in Childrens Blood to sweeten his
Humors. <hi>Cottier</hi> at last prescribed
him strong Presumes to smoak his
Cloaths and Hair, which being
used very often, threw the King
into Convulsions and Swoonings.
But somethime before, his fears of
Death increasing, moved him to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55231:56"/>
take hold of another Remedy as
deceitful and vain as his using
(as <hi>De Serres</hi> stiles him) an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
impudent audacious Physician,
much like most other pretended
Doctors. One <hi>Sieur Lavardin</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the King was gulled out
of his Life, was resolved at any
rate to see him, and told the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,
the King ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
and to receive the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
and that he knew him to
be near his end. But the Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
told him, that he knew that as
well as another, and that there
was danger to speak to him of it,
in regard he had been afraid of
Death this half year, and that if
he were spoken to about those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
he would certainly dye of
fear. Nevertheless <hi>Lavardin</hi> spoke
aloud to the King, that if he would
be cured, he ought to make his
Confession every week, and receive
the Holy Sacrament of the Altar,
and that his Father being an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years old, and sickly, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55231:56"/>
his Health by that means.
The King being perswaded, said,
that he did agree to it, provided
it was through a certain religious
Frier, named brother <hi>Philip,</hi> anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and of a good Life, and who
was noised to be Learned, and was
Monk of the Abby of Saint <hi>Martin.</hi>
He being arrived, in confessing of
him did remonstrate to him, he
ought to ask pardon for all the
Murders and Ravages which he
had caused to be committed during
his Life; and advised him, as far
as was possible, to make recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
where it could be done.
Among other things, that those of
the <hi>Franche conté</hi> complained, tho'
they were almost all reduced to his
Obedience, nevertheless his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
committed the most detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Insolencies, that could be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined;
remonstrating unto him,
that if God had spoken to his good
Servant <hi>David,</hi> that he should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
inhabit that glorious Temple,
which he would build to his Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55231:57"/>
because he had shed so much
human blood by his Wars, and
caused innumerable Acts of Hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to be done; that God would
therefore in this manner withdraw
himself from the Holy Sacrament,
which he would administer unto
him, and condemn him to Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
wherefore he ought to
cause his men to cease using any
more such ways, and to restore
the Taxes of the Kingdom to the
same state he found them, for the
People were extreamly impover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish'd,
and the most part of them
dead through want. He answer'd,
he was so far from repenting of
those Ravagements and Saccages
done in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> that he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
sorry, all the Land of the
Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> was not in the
same Estate; and as for the Taxes
and Subsidies which he had impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
on the People, as soon as
he was cured of his Distemper
(not else) that he would take
them off; nothing else could be
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55231:57"/>
got from him. Wherefore seeing
his Obstinacy, for fear he should
dye without Confession, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having taken the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they prayed the good reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Frier to give him Absolution,
and the Communion, which he
did. (But I do not read, that he
greased his Temples to make him
slip easily through Purgatory.)
Afterwards they gave him some
small matter to eat, but he could
not, by reason of a great stink,
he said, which rose from his Body
to his Brain; therefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
they should smoak him
with Perfumes, which they did a
great while, and he gave up the
Ghost in receiving of them; and
behold (saith <hi>Guion</hi>) how he dyed
smoakt all over like an old Fox.</p>
            <p>8. His Physician <hi>Iaques Cottier,</hi>
after the death of the King, retired
to his House, enrich'd with a year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Revenue of five and twenty
thousand Livers, the value of
which was more at that time,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55231:58"/>
than now thirteen or fourteen
thousand pounds Sterling. It was
certified by the return of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of the Treasurers <hi>de l' Espar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne,</hi>
that he had received from
them fourscore and eighteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Crowns.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth, the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Son of the forementioned
King, (for saith <hi>Mezeray,</hi> most
People did suspect that he was
suppositious) caused him to be
prosecuted, to make Restitution
of his Estate, as arising from Gifts
excessive, and passing all Reason.
But the King being busied in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ready for his Journey to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
and in raising of Money, <hi>Cottier</hi>
gave him fifty thousand Crowns
as Money lent, and so they let fall
the Prosecution against him. His
Consort the Barber, <hi>Olivier</hi> above
spoken of, was hanged for Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>10. The consequence of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Relation will incline any
sound Judgment to these Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55231:58"/>
1. That Princes, and other
great Persons are not seldom served
with the worst of Physicians, and
that excessive Liberalities do not
add so much vigour to their Care
or Diligence, as growth to their
Avarice; and its insatiability doth
commonly draw a Disease into its
greatest length; and so a string too
far extended frequently breaking,
unawares Death may be ushered in,
and prove the purchase of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
Fees. 2. That the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
fame of the greatest Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
is a chain of favourable, though
erroneous Reports, link'd from the
Beggar to the Gentleman, and
thence to the Prince. 3. That
Priests or Jesuits, and Physicians
uniting, have a most puissant as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent
on the faculties of the Soul
and Body of the sick (whether they
be the most illustrious, most noble,
honourable, or ignoble) and thence
deriving a despotick command over
their Estates, Secrets, and Lives,
are formed into most exquisite
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55231:59"/>
Tools, to acquire, propagate, and
establish unto his Popish Holiness
an universal Empire over Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom;
who, to add a greater
energy to these Organs, has mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall'd
both the one and the other,
throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> into separate
Colledges of Jesuits and Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
knowing that <hi>vis unita est for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior.</hi>
Behold then an instance of
those two influences, how admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
they conspire into one effect.
The Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth,
for over-matching <hi>Francis</hi> the First,
was by the pious Arguments of
a Frenchefied Jesuit, authorized
thereunto by his balancing Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
perswaded to quit his Throne
for to enter into a Monastery,
whence the Rays of his declining
Glory still continuing a warmth
in the Affections of his <hi>Spanish</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
had kindled a most fervent
desire of having their Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored;
but in prevention of this,
to accelerate his course below their
Horizon, the Jesuit Confessor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubles
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55231:59"/>
his macerating penance of
<hi>Vigilies, Ave Mary</hi> Lectures, and
other Castigations. The Convent
Physician substracts from his Diet,
and depauperates his dryed Limbs
by Purgations; so that by the
Harmony of these two State In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
the most potent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
and wisest Prince of that
Century was very cursorily redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to a <hi>materia prima.</hi> This was

            <p>MOre are the ways that lead
to the Gibbet, than to the
Church; the antiquated venefick
Methods are render'd obsolete, by
the refined Invention of Circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
through which bare-fac'd, and
by the light of the Sun, the same
end is attained, as justifiable by
innocency of the Medicines, as si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterly
imposed on the inadverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
populace. Suppose an elder
Brother decumbent of a continual
Fever; a dose or two of <hi>Extractum
Rudu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> (a Medicine in repute
among Doctors and Patients) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
under the Hand and Seal of
a gray-bearded Physician, smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
encouraged by <hi>Aurum portabile,</hi>
in very few days answers the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55231:60"/>
of the younger Brother,
maliciously aspiring to the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the first born. What pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
hath the Law, the Kindred,
or clamor of the World against
the Physician, or his Medicine,
which in this case, and several
others, doth as seldom miss, as
the most celebrated Poyson? Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
administred long after the first
kindling of a Fever of the same
kind, do as commonly give the
fatal blow to the succumbing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
without danger of a repartee
from the Standers by. A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
reduced to long weakness
through continuance of opiniatre
hysterick Fits, by the swallowing
down of a strong purgative, though
in a very small dose, especially if
with Repetitions, is infallibly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened
to her Tomb; in which
particular it is in the power of
the <hi>Medico,</hi> to oblige the Husband,
or Father in lesning his charge,
without hazard of Reputation, or
a necessity of giving an account to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55231:61"/>
his Collegues, or the World, of
such Practice: for what in the

error in Judgment, and in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients

the Crime, or hide the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,

to act intentionally, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
(when sufficiently gratified)
and yet remain secure under the
Pretences forementioned. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
all the modes of giving Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients

compiling a great Volume, and
therefore conclude it sufficient to
have given you just before that

            <head type="sub">The preceding Discourses being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt
with various Digressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to prevent your too tedious
amusement on the same Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
I proceed to examine the
invalidity of the great number
of simple Waters, which conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
will serve for Tools of
doing nothing, and therefore are
proper means to be used by the
Art of Expectation.</head>
            <p>THE distill'd Waters of <hi>Borrage,
Bugloss, Endive, Cichory, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delion,
Porslain, Lettuce,</hi> and the like,
in taste, smell, and their other sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
qualities, do little or nothing
exceed those of River water distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and operate less in cooling,
moistning, and other requisites,
than this last Element. And a
Physician is in nothing more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55231:62"/>
or imposes more grosly
on his Patients, than in prescribing
the distilled Waters of <hi>Oaken buds,
Horstails, Plantain, Shepherds purse,
Milfoil, knot Grass, &amp;c.</hi> for adstricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and repulsion, that quality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
chiefly resident in their terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial
parts, which never ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so high as the Alembic head,
cannot be thought to pass by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillation;
wherefore the Prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is extreamly blameable for his
error of Judgment, in not prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the decoction of those simples,
whereby their astringent qualities
are apparently to the taste, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to the Liquor, in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
as high or low as answers
the proportion of the Ingredients.
The same error is committed in
the distillation of <hi>Comfrey, Mallows,
Marshmallows, Snails, Muscels, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms,</hi>
and of all others, whose
chief effects are performed by a
lenifying smoothing mucilage, that
can no other way be extracted,
than by expression, or decoction;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55231:62"/>
whereas the weight of these mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous
Particles is an undoubted ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle
to their rising so high as the
Alembic. Can any thing be more
ridiculous, than to distill <hi>Nettles,
ground Ivy, Fumitory, Agrimony,</hi> or
<hi>Speedwel,</hi> whose superfluous insipid
Phlegm is only collected in drops,
to serve for no other use, than to
fill up glasses, that are to be empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the next return of the spring
into the Canels? One ounce of the
Juyce of <hi>Nettles</hi> will in vertue over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power
a gallon of the distilled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
a decoction or expression of
<hi>ground Ivy,</hi> or <hi>Fumitory,</hi> in the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of a spoonful, contains more
of the specific, than a Rundlet of
their distilled moisture. <hi>Poppy</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
may justly be rejected, where
one drop of Syrup of <hi>Poppy</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd
with more vertue, than a
pint of the distill'd Liquor. The
deobstruent endowments of all bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Herbs, as <hi>Wormwood, Succory,
Elicampane, Hoarhound,</hi> and <hi>German<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
remain in the bottom of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55231:63"/>
Still, whilst the Liquor that's se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from them, is scarce good
enough to wash hands. <hi>Sorrel, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
Citron, Oranges,</hi> and other soure
materials, will sooner be burnt, or
affected with an empyreum in the
bottom of the distilling Vessels,
than throw up their acidity to the
Alembic. The distillation of Oxe
dung doth better sute with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
of a Tom-t- d, than with the
Profession of such noble Doctors,
that have particularly inserted it
in their grave Dispensatory. Can
there be so much madness fixt in
the belief of any Physick Doctor,
or decrepid Nurse, that Water
drawn by distillation from Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
or Magpyes, ever cured the
falling Sickness, or any sort of
Convulsions? The number of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to be distilled, ought to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
to such Vegetables, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of volatile Particles, and others,
whose fragrant scent is transmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with their humidity; and the
most necessary of these are so few,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55231:63"/>
that ten, or a dozen, may for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Vehicles, and other uses, over-suffise.
To what purpose then do
the <hi>Augustan</hi> Doctors in their <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macopoea,</hi>
and in imitation of them
others in theirs, command near a
hundred simple Waters to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled,
unless to make a Well of
the Apothecaries Shop, to their
needless trouble and charge, and
yet grudge them to reimburs their
dammage in pouring of them into
the sinck every ensuing year, by
charging their losses on the higher
prizes of such Medicines, which
they shall have opportunity of sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?
so that in this sense it is not
eleven pence in the Shilling profit,
but rather twelve pence in the Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
loss; for which the poor Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary
that pays House-rent, scot
and lot, is singularly obliged to
their Doctorships.</p>
            <p>In the framing of the <hi>Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copoea
Hagiensis,</hi> I had my suffrage
as fellow of that Colledge of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,

turn to be twice Dean or President
of the said Society, as you may
read by Name in the printed Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
which are sold among the
Booksellers in <hi>London,</hi> as well as at
the <hi>Hague.</hi> It was not in any sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
power to prevail against all the
rest of the Collegues, to reduce the
twenty two only distilled simple
Waters there inserted, to ten or
eleven, which in my sentiment
seemed abundance for all necessary
Intentions; notwithstanding that
Dispensatory, comparatively with
others before, for smalness of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
election and correction of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
Medicines, may challenge
the first place with any other of
ancienter edition, though it hath
not escaped many of those errors,
that all others are culpable of, as
will be particularly instanced here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>The simple Waters drawn from
the flowers of Rosemary, <hi>Lime-trees;
Lavendel, Lillies of the Valley, Piony,</hi>
and from other cephalick simples,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55231:64"/>
forasmuch as their simple vertues
do in no proportion balance the
charge and trouble of their distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
deserve no rank in a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensatory,
especially in regard they
are all contained in several com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
Epileptick, and Apoplectick
Spirits, where their faculties and
powers are exalted, and copiously
extracted by the means of Wine or
Brandy, and may be allayed by
the admixture of any temperate
simple Water, to any degree you
please.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Epidemic water</hi> requires several
Animadversions. 1. <hi>Scorzonera</hi> roots
retaining little that is volatile,
yields less of an Alexipharmac and

flower or Oatmel. 2. The <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony</hi>
root possessing the total of its
prime vertues in weighty terrestrial
parts, continues its residence in the
bottom of the gourge, without
parting with more than an invalid
steem. 3. Besides scents of an ill
hew, and some strong heating oyly
Particles of the Cephalicks, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
discern any thing material in
the Composition for the purpose.
4. The Fountain water mixt with

Why then must this poysonous

as either of them, is accompanied
with neither Mace, Cloves, Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs,

Mace, either their office is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Salt-peter. If they pretend to
strengthen the Stomach, then they
hinder the Operation of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55231:68"/>
which is to weaken, irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
and provoke the Stomach, to
let go its hold of those slimy or
choleric Humors that oppress it;
whereas to strengthen the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
is to contract moderately its
Fibres, by the adstringent quality
of those Spices, whereby at the
same time the humors are bound
up, and pack'd in close, all which
is contrary to the intention of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting.
If you are fearful, that
the Stomach is very weak, give
less of the Medicine, and then my
most worthy Kindred, after the
operation of throwing up the load
of vitious Humors, approach with
a good burnt Claret, wherein your
Mace, Cloves, or Cinamon, will
do you Service. Pray consider;
Suppose you thought fit in your
Wisdoms to advise a vomit of
warm water and Sallade Oyl,
should you order Cinamon or Mace
to be boiled in it, the very Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and all the Boys of the Parish
would laugh at you. What, Cloves
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55231:69"/>
and Mace in a Vomitory? This is
thrusting from you, and pulling to
you, all at once. This is a Maxim
the Rusticks will oppose, without
the help of Logick. Wherefore I
do offer to take the blame upon
me, if henceforward the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries

which is endeavoured to be
prevented by letting the Wine
stand upon the Antimony, and
now and then giving it a gentle
shake. This not restoring it to its
former vertue, an <hi>Oxymel Vomitivum</hi>
will not only obviate that desect,
but by means of the Vineger cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the exorbitant faculty of that
Mineral, quicken it in Operation,
and attenuate the gross slimy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.
So that in my Opinion all
the recited Vomitories ought to be
expunged, and this remain the
only substitute. As for the simple
Waters, all ought to be discarded
to eight or nine, these medicated
Vinegers exterminated, except the
<hi>acetum destillatum,</hi> and the physical
Wines abandoned to those, whose
Palats will judge them grateful.</p>

            <p>1. WAter vyeth with the Earth
for the lower most Seat,
but in the Physick-shop it possesseth
the highest next the Cieling, and
the Region immediate to this is
the Dominion of the Wasps and
Flies, haunting the Syrup-pots,
the chief Ornament and Note of
Distinction of the Trade. Next
give me leave to inquire into their
inside and contents; not of all of
them, for that would more fit an
<hi>Atlas;</hi> but of such as are most in
use, and equally senseless. The
intent of converting Simples into
Syrups, is to preserve them the
Winter over, when they are not
to be had green; or to render them
more grateful; or for the sake of
their ready form to be dissolved in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55231:70"/>
any Potion, Decoction, or Julep.
In relation to the first, most useful
Herbs or Roots may be had in the
hardest Season, if not in their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
vigor, yet in their greatest decay
they do yield more powerful ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
to a Decoction, than what can
be supposed in a Syrup, which is
nothing but a decoction or expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Juyces, whose most energic
Particles are boil'd or evaporated
away to a sediment and slyme,
which then is to be inspissated by
a further Ebullition, through the
addition of a sufficient proportion
of Sugar, into a Syrup. Herewith
the Stomach is to be clog'd, inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and diseased, by its turning
foure and corrosive, as all Sugars
and sugar'd Medicines, be they
Syrups, Lohochs, Lozenges, or
the like, generally do. Moreover,
many Vegetables being preserved
dry, some are thereby exalted in
vertue, and others not much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based.
As to the matter of grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
such as retain a fragran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55231:71"/>
in their scent, seem most proper
for Syrups, to be prepared without
Ebullition; namely, Roses, Gilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers,
Violets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The last in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating
the readiness for Solution,
a sufficient reason for asserting the
necessity of Syrups, may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in <hi>Syrupus de meconio</hi> or <hi>diaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi>
some Purgative Syrups,
(appropriated to Children, and
such whose Palats must be courted
by the sweetness of Sugar) and a
smoothing lenifying Syrup, as of
Mashmallows; in fine, eight or ten
Syrups may be sufficiently capable
to satisfie all necessary intents and
purposes. Moreover, that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Syrups, Honey being indued
with healing, balsamic, gently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersive,
and diuretic Faculties,
ought to be preferred before Sugar,
needs no further Arguments to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the ascent of any rational
Physician.</p>
            <p>2. Leaving generals, I ought to
descend to the examination of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
where beginning with the
letter A seems most methodical.

disfavour of Nuns and Fryers, to
abate the carreer of their galoping
Lust; but as by wonderful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
we are delivered of their
vitious Company, so the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Syrup ought to be
razed by their Physickships out of
their Pharmaceutic Records. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I may be positive, though the
<hi>Ephesian</hi> Doctor had used pounds
of it in his Porridg, it would have
as little hinder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d the operation of

contrary. That Endive, Lettuce

                  </gap> castus</hi> in the mischief of
suppressing the propagation of
mankind, is oppositely attested by
most <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> who
throughout the whole year graze
abundantly upon it, and neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
attain to a numerous Issue.
Hempseed, another ingredient, by
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55231:72"/>
affording a copious strong juyce to
Pidgeons, occasions them to breed
more frequently than otherwise.
The broaths of Lentils and Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander-seeds,
the <hi>basis</hi> of all the rest,
is beyond all dispute a strong pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocative.
Since their attempt in
this kind proves so ridiculous, I
will offer to 'em a most infallible
Remedy against Petulancy. Let
the Patient exercise at the Spade in
a tough piece of ground from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
untill night, then give him a
half pint of thin Water-gruel with
a few crumbs of bread for Supper,
this Method continued for eight of
ten days, I do warrant will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
an absolute cure, without the
least drop of their Syrup of Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>3. Syrups are very frustraneously
multiplyed, that are filled almost
with the same Ingredients, and yet
intended for divers purposes; as
Syrup of Mugwood, and Syrup of
ground Pine, the former offering
at the provoking of the <hi>Menstrua</hi> in
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55231:72"/>
Women, the latter at the curing
the Gout, and all other Arthritick
Distempers in Men; as if the cause
of the suppression of the <hi>Catemenia</hi>
were the same, that causes the Gout;
can any thing be more senseless?
But these Syrups consist of a strong
brigade of simples as ill rank'd and
fil'd as ever I yet beheld. If no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will satisfie besides a Syrup,
one made of Elicampane roots,
Pennyroyal and Myrrh, shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the former a thousand degrees,
with the twentieth part only of
the trouble and charge.</p>
            <p>4. To what purpose shall the
decoction in the preparation of
Syrup of Mashmallows be clog'd
with Pellitory, Mallows, Plantain,
Maidenhair, Sparagus, Grass roots,
Raisins, and all the eight sorts of
cold Seeds, that shall choak and
hinder the main operation of the
Mashmallow roots and Cicers,
which is to widen, relax, render
slippery, and gently throw off.
In lieu of all this Garbage make a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55231:73"/>
strong decoction of Mashmallow
roots, red Cicers, and English Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quorish,
boyl them into a Syrup
with the best Honey. But if you
add to the Liquor in the boiling

tyed up in a rag, you will
have a Syrup, that in a fresh Scent,
Tast, and Vertues shall surpass all
the Syrups of that kind, that ever
were invented. And having this
Syrup, what occasion is there for
Syrup of Liquorish, Isop, Jujubees,
Mucilages, or other pectoral Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups,
when it is in your power to
advise <hi>ex tempore</hi> and <hi>pro re nata</hi> a
pulmonic decoction of inciding,
and abstersive Vegetables, or such
as answer your Indication, and
edulcorate it with the foresaid Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup,
if necessary. Likewise all

where one of them will
suffice in a decoction, that you shall

order for your purpose; unless his
Physick Hogship by a tautology of
Compounds intends to puzzle the
Apothecary, and impose on his
Opinion, there is a mystery in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
which shall limit his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of imitating the Physician,
and so secure the Practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
to himself.</p>
            <p>5. If Syrup of <hi>Rhubarb</hi> is design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for nice Palats, and Children,
the <hi>Rhubarb</hi> ought to be left out,
than which nothing is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful,
especially where the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
is foul. Is it not a superero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
folly to add Violet Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
as if that in clogging the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum</hi>
were not detrimental? But
to command the infusion to be
made in Betony, Cichory, and
Bugloss Waters, where good spring
Water acuated with <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi>
is infinitely more proper, and less
chargeable, is want of Judgment.
Here Cinamon may well be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

of this observe is evident in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews</hi>'s
Pill, where the poysonous
effort of the white Hellebore upon
the Stomach is by the <hi>Opium</hi> bound
up, by clowding the vital and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Spirits, until it's passed into the
Guts, when and where the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotick
Vertue being spent, that
malignant vegetable is at liberty,
to vent the remainder of its force
upon the Intestins, in moving of
Stools.</p>
            <p>4. Give me leave to examine
into the merits of these so highly
blazon'd Composts, and begin
with the greater worthy of the
twine, <hi>Venice Treacle,</hi> preferred
above all others, either because
prepared with an exactness extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
attested by the <hi>Venetian</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:55231:79"/>
Seal, as I have observed before,
or by reason that the <hi>Italian</hi> Vipers
are reputed of greater force, than
those brought hither from <hi>New
England.</hi> The Name of Treacle,
or <hi>Theriaca</hi> it desumes from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a
wild Beast, either because Vipers
are the chief Ingredients, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
its vertue is most signal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
the bites of wild Beasts. It
oweth its Invention to <hi>Andromachus,</hi>
Physician to <hi>Nero,</hi> whence you may
compute its very old Age, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
how the Tradition of so
many hundred years is arrived to
Physicians in the most assured re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of its infallible prevalence
(according to <hi>Galen</hi>) against the
greatest Diseases, particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the falling Sickness, Stone,
Dropsie, Coughs, Phtisick, spitting
of Blood, Swooning, Leprosie,
Gout, Madness from the bite of a
mad Dog, all Poysons, Plague,
Colick, plague of the Guts, many
Diseases peculiar to Women, and
a hundred more. No wonder, if
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55231:80"/>
this mixture was called the Queen
regent over all Medicines, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worthy to reign in the Closets
of Emperors, by whom it was
caused to be prepared with the
greatest cost and trouble. How
little those Vertues can be expected
from it, and how so vast a charge
of those Emperors in sending for
some of the Ingredients over all
<hi>Asia</hi> is expended in vain; and
how senseless and empirical the
Composition is, will easily appear
from the following Considerations.
1. That consisting of very many,
if not all, contrary Ingredients,
the one must necessarily destroy
the other. 2. That Treacle being
a Composition within a Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of several of the same Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials,
many of them are very
foolishly repeated, as in the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisci
Hedychroi</hi> are received <hi>Rad.
Phu. Pontic. costi, Cinamom. Shaenanth.
Opobalsam. Cassia Lign. Malabathrum,
Nardus indicus, Myrrh. Crocus,</hi> and
<hi>Amomum;</hi> all which are also again
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55231:80"/>
mentioned in the body of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.
3. Observe the mixture
of Purgatives, as <hi>Rhubarb, Agaric,
Sem. Thlaspios Sagapenum, Opopanax,
Chalcanthum Rubefactum,</hi> a vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and purgative, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringents,
as red Roses, <hi>Hypocistis,
Acacia, Pentaphyllon;</hi> consider fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these Adstringents joaked with
their opposites, Alexipharmacks,
Diaphoreticks, and Diureticks; as
Vipers, <hi>dictamnum cretieum, Petrose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linum
Macedonicum, Sem. dauci cret,
Foenic. ses. Ammeos: Therebinth, &amp;c.</hi>
next here must be Detergers, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalicks,
Pectorals, Hystericks,
Stomachicks and Spleneticks,
Gums, Resins, Earths, all sorts
of Spices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Basis</hi> is a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Sea Onion, or Squil baked in
a crust of Wheat, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exceding in weight all the other
Ingredients singly. But take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
also, that Pepper and <hi>Opium</hi>
together make an equal poize with
the forementioned Scallion. Is not
<hi>Venice Treacle</hi> standing on such a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55231:81"/>
               <hi>Basis</hi> likely to be framed into an
incomparable Gallimophory, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
where old decayed Viper
Cakes, and long Pepper are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
supporters of the mighty Electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.
The ill order, weight, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion,
and dissonance of such
a multiplicity of Ingredients can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be parallel'd with any thing
but it self, and its Sister <hi>Mithridate.</hi>
Take a mad man out of <hi>Bethlehm,</hi>
who hath the humor of mixing
upon him, open all the Drawers,
Pots, and Glasses of the Physick
Shop unto him, it will not be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for him to make a more irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
jumble, and which shall not
equal all the Virtues of <hi>Venice Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi>
provided a proportionable
weight of <hi>Opium</hi> be added by any
of a little more sense than the
<hi>Bethlemite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Suppose half a score Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
more, as Nut-shells powder'd,
Asses bones calcin'd, scraping of
Trenchers, and the like, be added
to the mixture; or that the same
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55231:81"/>
number of Simples be substracted,
be they <hi>Pentaphyllon, Calaminth,</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Cakes, or almost which you
please, conditionally, that the <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
be proportioned according to
the substraction or addition, will
you not believe, the Composition
shall be gifted with the same En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
and Qualities; or that
it is not possible, for you or any
man else not present at the jumble,
to know, or conjecture, what is
wanting, or what is thrown in?</p>
            <p>6. Next examine the nature of
the Ingredients. That the Stomach
from the corrosive burning and
cutting Qualities of the Squils is
apt to be ulcerated, is attested by
<hi>Dioscorides,</hi> whereunto the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
corrective of <hi>Orobus,</hi> or bitter
vetch flower gives a helping hand,
whose violence, according to the
same <hi>Dioscorides</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> consists
in an extream bitterness, and a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of causing a bloody Urin, and
a bloody Flux, with the attendance
of Convulsive gripes. These are
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55231:82"/>
the prime Jewels to bedeck the
Queen of Medicines, among which
the calcined <hi>Copperas</hi> is not the least,
a Mineral fitter for a gall'd horse's
back, or the Farsie, a demi-poison
promoting suffocating Vomits, and
torminous stools. The <hi>Rhubarb</hi> is
asserted by the Vouchers of <hi>Treacle</hi>
to be added to strengthen the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and <hi>Agarick</hi> to comfort the
Brain; an absurdity condemned
by the experience of all mankind,
that ever purgatives should be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboratives.
But they pretend to
excuse the injuries of those perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Simples by their small pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
which they insinuate can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
signifie much to so great a mass
as the whole Composition amounts
to. The same reason may as just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indemnifie the addition of a
dram or two of Arsenic or Rats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane,
Wolf-bane, and the like. To
blow your nose into a man's Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridg
can do no hurt, because the
quantity is little, is a parallel way
of reasoning, and of all men only
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55231:82"/>
peculiar to Physicians. But let me
tell you, the proportion is great,
if you joyn them together, thus:
of <hi>Agaric</hi> an ounce and half, <hi>Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb</hi>
six drams, burn'd <hi>Copperas</hi> half
an ounce, <hi>Sagapenum, Opopanax, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banum
&amp;c.</hi> all which being purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
make a strong party. Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that a patient in a malignant
Fever had by advice taken a dose
of <hi>Venice Treacle,</hi> to expel the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity,
which failing in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
effect, he happens to dye;
The Physician, should he by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
come to the knowledge, that
the Treacle wanted an Ingredient
or two, as juyce of Liquorish, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,
or any other of less moment,
the Hog would most certainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
the death of the Patient to
the defective Composition. In
conclusion, Treacle is no other,
than a most confuse, absurd and
senseless Opiat, which in all its
pretences would be out-done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
comparison, by a mixture of
of three or four, as <hi>Virg. Serpentary</hi>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:55231:83"/>
roots, <hi>Scordium,</hi> Bole armene, and
<hi>Opium,</hi> reduced with Honey into
an Electuary; or <hi>Angelica r. Terra
sigil. Gentian,</hi> and <hi>Opium</hi> mix'd with
Honey. The Extract of Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn,
<hi>Dictamnum Cret.</hi> and <hi>Opium</hi> is
also an equivalent. Great is the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
of the <hi>Indians</hi> in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of their Pagode Devils, defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with monstrous horns, but a
million greater is the superstition
of Physick Idolaters, that believe
it the greatest Sacrilege to diminish
the least tittle from a Composition,
as Sorrel-seeds, Pepper, and Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from <hi>Diascordium,</hi> or Pellitory
of <hi>Spain</hi> from the <hi>Philonia;</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
fragments and Stags-bone out
of <hi>Confectio de Hyacintho;</hi> the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of rejecting of all these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
doth demonstrate Physicians
to have longer Ears then Asses. To
roast Saffron in an Egg-shell to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
its virtues, is another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their <hi>Sagess</hi> in the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Elect. de Ovo.</hi> The Addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Pellitory of Spain, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55231:83"/>
Pepper to correct the extream cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Opium</hi> in the <hi>Philonia,</hi> is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
foolish notion, they cannot
be driven from.</p>
            <p>7. To what purpose is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of so many idle Opiats;
as <hi>Philonium Persicum, Romanum, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies
Nicholai, Nepenthes, Pil. de Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noglosso
&amp;c.</hi> when <hi>Opium</hi> dissolved
and digested with Spirit of Wine,
with or without Saffron, and used
in drops, or evaporated to a Pill,
is beyond all the imaginary cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectives,
which it doth not stand in
need of, since the onely danger it
can threaten is oversleeping into
a <hi>Coma,</hi> Lethargy, <hi>Carus,</hi> or death;
and that is no other way to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
than in omitting giving
of it to those, that are not judged
proper to take it, or to exhibite it
to others in less quantity, than it
can be presumed to exceed in
operation; for tho' you surround
<hi>Opium</hi> with all the spices of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
to guard nature from its vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
if you give too much, it
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:55231:84"/>
will not fail to kill, or extreamly
to frighten the standers by with a
posture of the patient very like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
death; and if you judge, that
advising very little of it in Phthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks,
or great Weaknesses, be a
sufficient warrant, you will find
your selves deceived, as those have
been, which I mentioned in the
<hi>Conclave of Physicians.</hi> I pass by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice of the purgative Electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries,
whose Absurdities in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
we shall sufficiently detect
in the Pill Boxes.</p>

absur'd Compositions of Disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satory
Pills.</head>
            <p>1. IF for those unaccountably er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
Compositions of <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
Methridate, Pil. Aloephanginae,
Foetidae,</hi> and the rest, the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
ought to be censured great
Ideots seventeen hundred years ago,
the Approvers and Confirmers of
'em a thousand years after may be
inferred greater Fools, but those
that subscribe to the continuance of
'em at this day, must be concluded
the greatest Fools; as if the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of Remedies consisted in
Compofition, and the more of
Composition there is, the greater
Virtues it contributes to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:55231:85"/>
2. That this is the rule, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to measure the Capacity of the
Artist, appears in the endeavours
of Physicians to prescribe long Bills,
filled with Composition, and by
how much the more it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
by so much the more
the Apothecary judges the Prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the best Physician. On the
contrary, the fewer Ingredients the
better Medicine, which occasions
less trouble and charge in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
and more certainty in
the Effect; for where a Remedy
consisteth of an hundred Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
to which of 'em can you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
the effect if successful, or
the fault and dammage if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease
be thereby render'd worse?
But such hath been the <hi>fallacia non
causae pro cause</hi> in Physicians, that
having prescribed to Patients a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Diseases of the Eyes, <hi>Pil.
Cochiae maj.</hi> and finding Success, and
a laudable Event, infer thence ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
deceitfully, that their particular
Composition doth arrogate speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55231:85"/>
an Eye or Sight restoring
power beyond all others; whereas
its to the vertue of the Purgatives,
chosen according to the strength
and other circumstances of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
and without any correctives
or Conductors, those good effects
are to be imputed.</p>
            <p>3. The same reason confutes
the specific relation of <hi>Pil. de Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rico</hi>
to the Lungs; <hi>Aggregativae, de
Tribus,</hi> and <hi>Imperiales</hi> to all the
Bowels; <hi>Aureae</hi> and <hi>Lucis</hi> to the
Eyes; <hi>de Eupatorio</hi> to the Liver;
<hi>Diambrae, Macri,</hi> and <hi>de Succino</hi> to
the Brain; <hi>Tartareae Q.</hi> to the
Spleen; <hi>de aloe lota, Aloephanginae,
Stomachicae,</hi> and <hi>Ruffi</hi> to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach;
<hi>Stomachicae cum gummi</hi> to
the Stomach and Spleen; <hi>de hiera
cum Agarico,</hi> and <hi>Mastichinae</hi> to the
Stomach, Lungs and Brain; <hi>foetidae,

to the Joynts, and other gouty Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases;
<hi>Mechoacannae</hi> and <hi>de Gutta
Gamandra</hi> to Dropsies; <hi>de Styrace</hi>

Lungs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:55231:86"/>
4. Pause a while, and with me
consider the depth of folly of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
the more astonishing, for as
much as it is signally remarkable
in those, who by the study of their
whole Life-time, and the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Learning derived from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of thousands of years, are
advan'd no further, than by giving
Credit to lying Antiquity, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
such idle absur'd superfluous
and pernicious Compositions into
the <hi>Pharmacopoea,</hi> and what is worse,
to impose the use of 'em upon the
Physicians of a whole Nation, is
a perfect Physick Popery, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition,
damning all those, that
are gifted with too much Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Honesty to submit to
their Fopperies, as Popery anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizes
such, whose light of reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
of conviction of Conscience
will not be subjected to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
Indulgences, ridiculous Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
and blind idolatrous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
And as <hi>Luther</hi> was the first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that succeded in the detecting the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55231:86"/>
antiquated follies of whole centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Ages, the chief scope where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was no other, than by an usurpt
Dominion over the Consciences of
Men, and detaining of them in
that blind slavery to triumph over
the Liberties of their Persons, and
enrich themselves by the high pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes
of their Indulgencies, Pardons,
and other most wicked Devices,
whereunto their fulminatory Bulls,
and cursed Excommunications, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
at the hour of Death, are
so greatly instrumental. And why
is't not equally probable, that any
honest and discerning Judgment
may with the same Success, and
Perspicuity of Argument expose,
and detect the grossest of Errors
and Absurdities in Physick, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
by the unreasonable and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannizing
power assumed by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claves
of Physicians, to no other
end than to domineer over the
Lives of Men, and to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
out of their Estates, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaving
their Opinions to their
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55231:87"/>
mischievous Compositions, and
most senseless Prescriptions?</p>
            <p>5. The minute courge, that
some few years ago incited me to
correct <hi>Extractum Rudii,</hi> by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off the <hi>Pulvis Diarrhodon Abba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
that idle non-corrective, and
substitute an aromatic or two, as
you may read in my <hi>House Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary,</hi>
was an attempt, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
durst enter the thought of any
Physician before me, though soon
after was imitated by a whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
in their <hi>Pharmacopoea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. What means the addition of
Mastick, Hore-hound, Sarcocol,
and Myrrh to the Purgatives in
<hi>Pil. de Agarico,</hi> since the former in
their virtues are over-ruled and
drowned by the latter, and their
mutual reaction not only breaks
the force of each other, but clogs
the Composition into too large a
bulk. The same reason is much
more prevalent against the inspissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Juyces of Agrimony, Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed,
Polypody, Mastich, red Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55231:87"/>
               <hi>Epithymum,</hi> Anis Seeds, and
Ginger in de description of <hi>Pilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae
Aggregativae.</hi> The <hi>Myrobalans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so weak a Purgative, are rather
used for their adstringent faculty,
and therefore ought to be rejected
hence, as also the red Roses and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stich,
which by their adstriction do
hinder, and retard the purgative
Faculties of the chief Ingredients.
The Office of Anis-seeds, and Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is to discuss the Winds or Flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osities,
which the Cathartic Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
causes; or rather those en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
Gripes owe their original to
sharp vellicating Humors, thrown
off by the Purgatives upon the Guts,
which the hot fiery Particles of the
Ginger, and Anis-seeds do extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
provoke, and increase, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought be shut out.</p>
            <p>7. To speak plain, the proper
Assistent to Nature upon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Purge, which in effect is the
true corrective of Purgatives, is
some time after the Cathartic hath
been swallowed down, to take a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55231:88"/>
               <hi>Bouillon Maigre,</hi> or lean Broath made
of Mashmallow-roots, or young
Mallow-leaves, Endive, and Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
or Bugloss, with a little fresh
Butter, and three or four grains of
Salt dissolved in it; or Posset-drink
with a little Butter and Salt may
also be used instead of the <hi>Bouillon.</hi>
The Butter by its oyly parts ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
the Stomach and Guts smooth
and slippery, and lineing the Guts
to defend them from the acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of the preterfluent incensed Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
the mucilaginous and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt
parts of the Herbs assisting in
the precipitating the Purgative, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Humors out of the
Stomach and Guts, and conspiring
with the Butter in the defence of
the membranous parts, the Salt by
gentle Stimulation spurring the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres
of the Stomach and Guts to
Expulsion, these are the proper
Defensives and Correctives of a
purgative Medicine, though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
so violent as to be suspected of
a malignant faculty, as <hi>Scammony,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55231:88"/>
Colocynthis, Hellebore, Gialap, Gum.
Gut.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>8. The uniting of Purgatives
supplying reciprocally each others
defects, and the additament of one
out of three or four sorts of Salt
for a corrective, is the only right
and sutable way of cathartic Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
whereby the forecited In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenients
are precluded. Thus
the flowness of Aloes is quickned by
the prompt Operation of <hi>Scammony</hi>
and <hi>Colocynthis,</hi> the roughness and
emetic quality of which latter, and
of all others is smoothed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated
by some sort or other of
fixt Salt, which to <hi>Turbith, Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dactyls,
Gum. Gut. &amp;c.</hi> doth impart
the same advantage.</p>
            <p>9. Most sorts of Dispens. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
cathartic Pills exhibited
in a just dose, do nevertheless in
many Constitutions cause most
dreadful Oppressions on their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs,
because they are empiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
mixt, and clogged with Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients

should he dwell eight or ten years

I will give you in one, that was
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55231:92"/>
the greatest Anatomist of his time,
and no extraordinary Physician,
namely Dr. <hi>William Harvey,</hi> whose
erroneous Judgment was very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
in the prescription of a
Purge for <abbr>Esq</abbr> 
               <hi>Rainton</hi> of <hi>Enfield,</hi>
where the Apothecary refraining
to prepare more than half the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
notwithstanding gave him
fourscore stools, which otherwise
according to the Doctors measures,
must unavoidably have scower'd
him from the close Stool into the
other World. The Consult made
a great noise, when Dr. <hi>Wright,
Prudgean, Bates,</hi> and others, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the famed Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> were
Principals; and one Mr. <hi>Farwel,</hi>
Barrister of the Temple, was Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
and Complainent of a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Disease in his Belly, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
him of the use of his
Limbs, Strength, Appetite, and
Digestion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the forementioned
Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> ingrossed to himself
the speaking part, by reason of
his extraordinary claim to Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55231:93"/>
and which here, if any where,
seemed to be of use; after a long
contrectation of all the <hi>abdomen,</hi>
did very magisterially and positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
assert all his Symptoms to arise
from an <hi>Aneurism</hi> of an Artery,
and therefore incurable, as being
too remote to come at, wherein
all, except Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> very readily
concur'd, though it was a most
absur'd offer in Opinion, as ever I
yet heard. The Patient being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to give up his cause so;
removed his <hi>Corpus cum causa</hi> to
<hi>Chelsie,</hi> where Sir <hi>Theodore Majerne</hi>
lay Bed-ridden at his Country-house,
who upon no long <hi>examen</hi>
of the matter told him, he was
the second, or third Patient he had
met with diseased in the same kind,
and very boldly expressed, he would
cure him, but with this inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that he could throw the cause
of the Disease either into his Arms
or Legs, according to the choice he
would make of those Limbs, which
he could best spare, or which of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55231:93"/>
'em might be more or less useful
to him, without consulting the
Will and Pleasure of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
an Arrogancy unheard of, and
favouring more of the Atheist (as
too many of 'em are) than a pious
Physician, as then especially he
ought to have been, being not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
stages from his Journeys end.
Mr. <hi>Farwel</hi> in respect of his Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
where writing is so necessary,
replyed, that his business being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentary,
he could best yield to the
captivity of his Legs, though even
they upon the Doctors assurance
should be released by a Month or
six Weeks diligence at the Bath.
You are to apprehend, that the
cause of this great Disease was an
obstinate obstruction of the <hi>Glanduls</hi>
of the <hi>Mesentery</hi> immensely swelled
up, and hardned by coagulation of
tartarous and slimy Humors, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a strong pressure upon the
<hi>Arteria magna,</hi> which by a potent
renixe did duplicate its force of
Pulsation, that imposed on Dr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:55231:94"/>
the false notion of an <hi>Aneuris,</hi>

milkie, and other Vessels, occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
the great Weakness of his
Limbs, an Atrophy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by
hussing up the Bowels against the
Diaphragm, rendred his respirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
extraordinary difficult. The
grand empirical Medicine (from
which his Father <hi>Turquetus,</hi> usually
by the French nicknamed the <hi>Turc,</hi>
had got great Reputation by selling
it publickly on the Stage, whom
Sir <hi>Theodore</hi> in his younger years
had attended in that Employ, if
common Vogue may be credited) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a proportionable Dose mixt
with some gentle Purgatives, had
the success to dissolve those gross
glutinous Humors, and through
their weight and tendency down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
throw them down into his
Legs, as being parts much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and consequently more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55231:94"/>
suscipient. Nature by being
disburdened of that load, that had
hitherto obstructed the free course
of his nutritive and animal Juyces,
was vigorous enough to restore the
Bowels to their former Functions,
as afterwards the Bath proved no
less effectual in retrieving the use of
his Legs. The following case of a
Taylor in <hi>Fleet-street,</hi> whose Name
has escaped my Memory, though
I can with little difficulty recover
the knowledge of it, was not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.
His complaint to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
was a <hi>Sciatica,</hi> that render'd
him lame and cripple, besides fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
returns of very sharp pains.
The Dr. would not ingage in the
cure of so great and hazardous a
Disease, without a considerate and
distinct answer to three Points:
1. Whether he could sequester him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from his Trade for three
Months. 2. Whether he valued
the expence of fifty pounds beyond
the recovery of his health. 3. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he could contemperate his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55231:95"/>
in enduring the Part to be laid
open to the bone, by cutting or
burning. The Patient very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
consented to the two former
conditions, Time and Money; but
to the third being entirely averse,
took his leave with the ceremony
due to so famed a Physician, and
applyed himself to another of a
much lower form, who with little
preamble advised him to the Bath,
where he received a perfect cure
in six weeks. No doubt but Dr.
<hi>Harvey</hi> in Anatomy, and happiness
of theoretic discoveries might just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pretend the precedency of all
his Contemporaries; and others

that assertion, and others premised
in former Paragraphs, yet their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
among the vulgar, that is
so much debauch'd by the false Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions

be hoped for, as the Gospel among
<hi>Mahometans,</hi> that are so deeply pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
by impious Doctrines infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
into them by their Priests in
their Infancy, and cherish'd until
their Deaths.</p>
            <p>4. The Tools, and the <hi>materia
medica</hi> us'd by the Art of curing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases
by Expectation, are sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discoursed on; the practick part
consists in the <hi>Methodus</hi> of applying
those insignificant Remedies. As
the Doctrine of other Arts depends
on certain Theorems, and <hi>Postula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
so doth this famous one. 1. <hi>Most
curable Diseases are cured by Nature and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55231:97"/>
Time. 2. Many Diseases become incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and consequently mortal, where Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is too weak, and time too short.
3. Nature being strong, and the Disease
weak, or not very violent, time is the
grand Remedy, and the principal Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum.</hi>
It follows then, that the
chief scope and intention of the
<hi>Expectation</hi> Physician is the gaining
of Time, and to clude the Patient
from time to time, until Nature
hath conquered the Disease. The
way he deludes the Patient in time
is, 1. Confidently he assures him
from this time to that of relief and
abatement of his Distemper; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thereunto presents him with a
Narrative of several of his Patients
diseased in the same manner, how
at this hour and that, this day and
that day they received most sensible
abatements; but be sure he hath a
good Memory, for fear the Patient
entraps him, for sick-men are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
ruminating, and <hi>oportet
Mendacem esse Memorem.</hi> This part
being acted with a good <hi>meen,</hi> as a
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55231:97"/>
soure face, a black yerking, broad
Bever, a huge weighty Cane (that
adds much) and a pretended Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
will extreamly (as Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricians
say) incline the hearing,
and gain the assent of his sick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor,
insomuch that his Spirits
will be roused thereby, that he may
plainly see them walk and jump
all over his Phys<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a blithe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
this fourbery repeated
once or twice a day (if the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
feeth well, not else) will make
him patiently expect from one day
to another, from one week to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and from one Month to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(not from one year to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
unless he be mad) until at
last Nature hath vanquish'd the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease,
the Patient is cured by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
and the Physician steals
the Title of triumphant from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
with a Purse of Guinea's.</p>
            <p>5. If the Patient prove resty to
all good admonitions for gaining
of time, the Expectation Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
changing his Dialect, threatens
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:55231:98"/>
to desert him, as <hi>Cottier</hi> did the
King of <hi>France,</hi> with a Prognostic,
if any other (honester) Physician
takes him in hand, he infallibly
dyes; moreover gives him very
negligent visits, makes the Patient
send twice or thrice, before he
comes once, and then tarries so
little, that he pretends, this Duke,
that Earl, a third and a fourth
Noble man are in a most wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
hot pursuit for his advice, who
all are sick of his Distemper. This
argument is so prevailing, that it
will tye the Patient to his Bed, or
his Chamber, as long as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
pleases, and makes him a slave
to any time he thinks fit.</p>
            <p>6. Besides this Chamber Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
and Tongue Practice, there
must be some Remedies prescribed,
that do no good, the best of which
are such as do no hurt, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
must be very safe. And
since all Remedies tend to this
scope, that they may assist the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
in passing over of his time,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55231:98"/>
they ought to be prescribed to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
set hours, which in waiting
for he always passeth so much time;
and therefore he ought to have a
different Medicine prescribed for
him to take every hour, or at least
every two hours; for as I said, the
expecting such and such hours is a
great means to pass away time.
Those Expectation medicines should
be of different tast and scent, but
chiefly pleasant, so however that
they may not be hurtful; these are
to entertain the Patient's Palat, and
to a sick man are what the smoke
of Tobacco is to one that's well.
External medicines are also of great
use here, in regard they will take up
the Patient so much time in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
renewing, and shifting. As for
example, to a great pain in the
head, or any other part, a friendly
po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ltis of three or four insignificant
herbs, a little Bran, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ought
to be prepared in the Patient's
Chamber, that he may pass away
so much time in seeing them sent
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55231:99"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or, brought to him, and boyl'd in
his presence, and then applied, and
knowing likewise what the Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
are, he will give the more credit
to such things, which his Grannum
used to tell him, were very good
and soverain. In the Gout likewise,
if the Expectation-Physician pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
his Patient <hi>gratis</hi> with this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>nostrum,</hi> it will not only be
well taken, but much more vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
will be given to it, than if
it came from the Apothecaries shop,
and to the Physician will redound
a very lasting diffusive glory and
reputation; <hi>viz.</hi> ten links of thred,
half yard long, dipt in Wax of ten
different colours; each is to be
tyed by the Patient, if possible, or
by his Nurse, to each distinct Toe
of the Feet, and to be untied every
hour or two, and changed to other
toes, namely, the red wax't thred
where the green was, the blue
where the yellow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By this
means a great deal of time will be
passed, and if the Patient continues
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:55231:99"/>
tying and untying, until a good
long fit is expired; it will have also
another good effect of rendring his
back very flexible, and being tired
at Night prove a means to make
him sleep without the charge of a
dose of <hi>Opium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Since it cannot well be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that I shall exemplify the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodus
medendi</hi> together with the
Remedies of this rich and noble
Art in all Diseases, I will only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
it in some few, that are most
universal. A continual Fever after
once or twice bleeding, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all dispute is of use, and truly
preparative to a Cure, requires a
good thin water Gruel, or a Barley
water with its appurtenances for an
ordinary drink. Next two or three
sorts of Cordials to be taken at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
hours, for reasons before
mentioned. Also some few testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous
Powders for other times of
Physick Devotion. If the Belly
hath forgot its Office, that may
be minded of its duty by a Milk
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55231:100"/>
and Sugar Glyster every other day.
The Spirits of Harts-horn well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
and the blistering Plaister
may be put in use in the declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Distemper, for then they
will prove the least hurtful. The
Cordials usually consist of two or
three simple Waters, as of <hi>Carduus
ben. Scabious, &amp;c.</hi> with a fourth part,
or rather sixth part of <hi>Epidemic</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the Julep to be sweetned with
Syrup of Gilliflowers. Such sort of
simple waters mixt with a fourth
or sixth part of small Cinamon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,
Pearl grinded into an impal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
Powder, which Crabs Eyes
will equal in all its pretended Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
and sweetned with fine
white <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ugar; all this makes up the
Pearl Cordial. For your dyet avoid
flesh meat, and content your self
with Grewel, Panada, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more certain then that this
whole course is perfectly <hi>Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
there being nothing in it that
makes the least step towards a real
true cure, so that all those, that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:55231:100"/>
are recovered by such a Method
and Remedies, owe the restitution
of their health to strenght of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Time. Desume your cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative

               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:55231:101"/>
8. Can any one without scorn
behold such drones of Physicians,
(I speak generally, and therefore
desire no false <hi>Innuendo</hi> may be
made) that after the space of so
many hundred years Experience
and Practice of their Predecessors,
not one single Medicine hath been
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et detected by them, that hath the
least force directly and <hi>per se</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
resist, or expel a continual
Fever, which by their erroneous
Applications is too oft provected to
malignity? Should any by a more
sedulous Observation pretend, or
make the least step towards the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of such Remedies, their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and envy would swell against
him, as a Legion of Devils against
Vertue; whole Societies would dart
their Malice at him, and torture
him with all the Calumnies ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
without sticking at any
thing, that should destroy and rain
him root and branch, (or which
I could give you a very memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Example, were it convenient)
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55231:101"/>
for he that professes a reformation
of the Art of Physick, in exposing
its Impostures, and advancing such
Methods and Remedies, that are
beyond those of the Art of Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
must resolve to run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of the Martyrdom of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
Life, and Estate, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when its considered, that the
greatest and best part of Mankind
is prepossest with a Judgment, that's
imus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d into them by Expectation
Physicians, to some or other of
whom almost every man is linck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
by Acquaintance, Kindred, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
or Drunkenness.</p>
            <p>9. Nothing hath ever proved
more fatal than this universal No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that in the small Pox you
must always be driving out, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
strong Diaphoreticks or sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Medicines, which in kindling
the Fever-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igher, that's usually a
concomitant, or rather preceding,
doth convert it into malignant, and
continuing as such, its impossible
the virulent Eruptions should ever
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55231:102"/>
appear, considering the small Pox
is a <hi>Crisis,</hi> or critical propulsion of
virulent Pustles, (very commonly)
of a <hi>Febris continua imputris,</hi> or <hi>Diaria
plurium dierum,</hi> ordinarily so termed
by Physicians, and oft-times of a
<hi>Febris continua putrida.</hi> A <hi>Crisis</hi> is
never to be expected but after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion
and separation, and then
ensues Expulsion; so that if you
endeavour to expel by sweating,
before Nature is ready by finishing
the digestion and separation, you
do most certainly anger the Spirits,
and put them into an high fury, and
as long as you continue thus, you
may sooner expect Death, than
the breaking forth of the small
Pox. In this particular it is, that
Nurses, and the careful old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
by their common Expectation
Remedies, as Harts-horn or plain
Posset-drink, or a small Fig-deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in Water or small Beer, do
oft excel the best of Physicians in
their erroneous Methods of driving
out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:55231:102"/>
10. Considering further, that in
many Children and others, there
is proceding only a small simmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Blood, which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
enough be termed a <hi>Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
an <hi>Ebullition</hi> being a more
violent and impetuous motion,
which if abated or intirely quieted
by cooling aqueous, and acid Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leps,
the virulency is suppressed in
the Eruption, or repelled upon the
Brain and Nerves, whence succeed
mortal Convulsions; or upon the
Vitals, <hi>viz.</hi> the Heart and Lungs,
occasioning an immediate Suffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or terminative <hi>Syncope.</hi> On
the other hand, where there is an
high Fever or putrefactive Ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
until that be reduced to a
gentle Fermentation (for in the
most laxe sense an Ebullition and
Fermentation differ only <hi>secundum
magis &amp; minus,</hi> and in the end) the
small Pox or Meazels will never
break forth, though using the
strongest expulsives, which most
certainly failing in their intended
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55231:103"/>
effect, never fail in the raising the
Fever to the highest acuteness and
malignity; and therefore I have
ever observed, that most of those
that are grown up, who dye under
the Hands of Physicians, owe their
death to the Fever, and killing
Medicines, and not to the deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of expulsion, which cannot be
expected, as long as the putrid Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is not reduced to a Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as they call it. When the Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
appears, if too slow, it is to be
quickned; if too violent, it will be
moderated by such proper Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
as resist that Malignity.
Moreover, this remark hath been
constant, that the great proflux of
virulent matter to the skin in a
flux't Pox, proceeds from not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
the putrid Fever in a foul
Body (and in others also) by pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Medicines unknown to most of
them, before it came to too great
an height. If any part of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
matter of steems return into
the internal parts in a fluxt Pox,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55231:103"/>
where the external Pores are very
oft stopt, it doth not seldom prove
mortal, the principal parts being
too much weakned to repel it back
to the circumference. The truth
of these Observations may seem
probable from my own good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
who never to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
was concern'd with Man,
Woman, or Child, that dyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my Hands of the small Pox or
Meazels in thirty years, except
one, a Boy aged seven or eight
years, to whom I was sent one day
before he dyed, to consult with one
Mr. <hi>Barmick,</hi> a Physick Doctor, and
the Families then ordinary Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian.
The Childs Skin being speck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with black Spots like Pestilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<hi>Exanthemata</hi> or Tokens, the
Pox appearing of an Olive colour,
and attended with a bloody Urine,
it was told the Parents, it was too
late; we agreed upon two or three
Expectation Remedies, and so end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our <hi>grave</hi> Consult.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:55231:104"/>
11. Coughs, as I mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
are through <hi>Expectation</hi> cured
by Syrups, and other sugar'd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posts,
which sometimes prove the
worst of Expectation Remedies, in
regard they clog and oppress the
Stomach, though by a present
smoothing of the Gullet, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ease, they readily perswade
the coughing Patient he receives
benefit, and therefore is very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to stay from one time to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
until by the help of absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
Nature hath thrown up the
abounding slyme.</p>
            <p>12. For the better understanding
of this matter, know there are more
Coughs of the Stomach, than of
the Lungs; and that most Coughs
in the beginning are Stomach-Coughs,
though afterwards by
long continuance some turn into
Lung-Coughs, and then they threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
danger. The Diaphragm with
the help of the Musculs of the
Breast and Belly, or <hi>abdomen,</hi> do
as readily discharge or displode
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55231:104"/>
and throw-up humors out of the
Gullet, and by succession out of
the Stomach, as out of the Wind-pipe
or Lungs. These humors are
lodged in the glanduls of the Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
discoursed of at large in my
Treatise of the Scurvy, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
swelled up, and irritated by
Acrimony, contracted from the
admixture of the vitiated dissolvent
or ferment of the Stomach, and
long Stagnation, by consent of
parts and vellication of the Nerves
of the sixth pair, incite and spur
the diaphragm to an Explosion.
The <hi>Argumentum à Iuvantibus &amp;
laedentibus</hi> plainly proves the asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
1. Smoothing Medicines have
a present influence upon those
Coughs, which must necessarily be
from their immediate acting upon
the Gullet, for their property and
vertue without all contradiction
must be changed into a different
Operation, before they can be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to arrive to the Lungs. 2. Its
vulgarly known, that Vomitives,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:55231:105"/>
or Purgatives have cured thousands
of these sort of Coughs, by empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Stomach, and drawing from
the Glanduls of the Gullet. 3. Sharp
foure drinks, Salts, and Spices do oft
immediately force violent Coughs.
4. The sense of the Patient doth
testifie a weight and oppression at
the Stomach, loathing of Victuals,
and impair of digestion. 5. Fasting
by diminishing those humors in
the Stomach is another affirmative
proof. 6. Long and deep coughing
oft moving to nauseousness and
Vomits, plainly demonstrates the
Stomach chiefly affected in this sort
of Cough. 7. The slime that's
thrown up being oft yellow, green,
and of other variegated colours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
that tincture in many cases
from the different qualities and
nature of the dissolvent or ferment
of the Stomach, varying according
to the nature of the food ingested a
day or two before. 8. The same
slime hath sometimes been obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be mixt with an indigested
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55231:105"/>
chyle. 9. Syrup of Violets hath oft
been return<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d by Cough and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration
with Phleme tinctured
blue, a Proof, it came from the
Stomach or Gullet. Besides these,
I must omit many other Arguments
too prolix to be here inserted.</p>
            <p>13. Those Coughs that have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
some ten, twenty, or thirty
years, and others I have known to
continue forty years, are undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
Stomach Coughs; and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
rather the office of an Issue
or drain, are scarce to be termed
Diseases, but necessary Evacuations,
and are to be treated very cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously;
for being violently turned
downward by repeated strong Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives,
nature having lost its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
roads, must in some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval
of time extreamly suffer by
it. Very frequently a long Cough
doth turn either to a Consumption
with an Hectic Fever, or to a putrid
continual Fever. In Consumptions
attended with an Hectic Fever, the
slime that's expectorated is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:55231:106"/>
for the most part with puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Particles.</p>
            <p>My design not being a Treatise
of Coughs, further than to give
you an instance of its expectative
mode of curing, which in this and
the preceding Diseases is a sufficient
pattern for many others, I proceed
to the next.</p>

upon the knowledge of the arrival
of any Doctor of Physick to their

to depute two Collegue Physicians
out of their body, to congratulate
him at his House or Lodgings, and
give him an Invitation in obliging
Language, that he will please to
give them the honour of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

where shewing unto him their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,

a very unchristian way of dealing?
The case is much the same.</p>
            <p>The true description of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
asserts the regulation of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
to be one of the true ends;
that is to agree to such rules or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
as may direct and guide them
in Consultations; as that the elder
Physician shall give his Opinion
first, on last; that the suffrages or
Opinions shall be collected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by the Physician in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
of the Patient. That no Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:55231:109"/>
shall insinuate into the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
favour to put out the Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n
in ordinary, and such like or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
But these are not to relate to
any Physician, that is not of their
College, who in all Protestant
Countries have an equal priviledge
of Practice, which is derived from
the Universities. For a College of
Physicians to pretend to examine,
and give Licenses to practice, is a
down right affront and injury to
the Universities. It is most natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that they that teach a Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ought to be Judges to know,
when the Scholar is sufficiently
taught to exercise that Profession.
Shall an University be at the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and charge to maintain Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
to instruct and teach Scholars,
and not have the honor and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
to endow them with the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
to exercise what they taught
them. It is a cheat in all Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
to grant a power and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of practising Physick, if they
cannot maintain it; this is non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55231:110"/>
all over. If a College of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
will presume to give Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
they ought to entertain Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
to read and teach Physick, and
confer degrees; and then they must
come under the notion of an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity.
Neither can or ought any
Popish <hi>College</hi> of <hi>Physicians</hi> (abroad)
be so impudently arrogant, as to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
a power to judge of <hi>Male-pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi>
and thereupon arbitrarily to
set a mulct, or imprison; for that
would infer them to be judge and
party, which is most absurd. Besides
it implyes, they take a Regal Power
upon them; for a Prince is the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Judge, there being none above
him; and so a College pretends to
be the supreme Judge of <hi>Mase</hi>-pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
there being none above them
to judge of their <hi>Male</hi>-practice, as
oft as they shall commit it, unless
you will presume a College cannot
err, no more than a Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
to judge, determine, fine, and
imprison, is to undertake upon the
power of the Civil Magistrate, to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:55231:110"/>
abridge their Authority, and to
affront their respect and dignity,
which is the greatest piece of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence,
that can be alledged. No
more than the <hi>Guild</hi> of Goldsmiths
can punish and imprison any of
their own Members, or Foreigners,
for counterfeiting or abasing the
Standart of Gold or Silver in a
piece of Plate, can a College punish
any Physician for <hi>Male</hi>-practice,
or Murder, neither can they arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily
extort sums of Money from
Apothecaries or Mountebancks, for
vending of good or bad Medicines.
These are matters the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
takes cognisance of, and the
<hi>Corpus Iuris civilis</hi> is provided with
Laws under several heads for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
Physicians, Apothecaries,
Surgeons, Mountebancks, and all
others for <hi>Male</hi> and illegal Practice;
and every offence or crime being
only punishable by one sole proper
Court, shall a man be punish'd by
a College of Physicians, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
be punishable by the common
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:55231:111"/>
Laws of a Country? this certainly
is an absurdity; for no man can
or ought to be twice punish'd for
the same offence. In a College of
Physicians all ought to be Doctors
of Physick, that is, of an equal
rank and dignity, without pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to any other precedency, than
what for orders sake Seniority al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows;
or how can they else be
termed a Society or a meeting for
sociable Conversation, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
includes a parity and equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

Physick whose streightness of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
