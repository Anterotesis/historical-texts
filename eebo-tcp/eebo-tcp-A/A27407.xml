            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A true TESTIMONY, concerning Oathes and Swearing, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN the day that Almighty God created Man (before man was) in his Image and according to his own likeness, created he him, male and female created he them; and having finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the works of Creation, he looked upon all that he had made, and lo it was very good: And having also made the Man of the Dust of the Earth, He planted a Garden Eastward in <hi>Eden,</hi> where he put the Man whom he had made: And that Man might learn Obedience, the Lord commanded him, saying; <hi>Thou shalt eat freely of every Tree of the Garden; but of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt die the death.</hi> Now in that day, there was no strife or controversie; for what the Lord commanded, it was done, as it's written, <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.9. <hi>For he spake, and it was done; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and it stood fast.</hi> And God was all in all, and over all, the Law-giver, Judge, and King. And as then there was no sin in the World which God had made; so neither was there any controversie or strife betwixt Man and his Maker, or amongst the Creatures of God, neither was there any Oath or Swearing, nor any other outward or visible Sign, Shadow, Type, or Figure, in or by which the Lord was to be worshipped, nor any need thereof; for the Lord God who is the substance of all, was all in all, and over all, God blessed for ever; who was worshipped not in words, but in deeds; not with Oaths and Swearing, neither in set Forms, Shadows, Signs, or Figures; but in Spirit and Truth, in Love and true Obedience, which was and is better than Sacrifice, or the fat of Rams: And in that day the Law of the Spirit which is Eternal (and nor Moral) was the rule and guide of Man in his Worship and Service of God, with whom Man in his Spirit had unity and fellowship, in the Light, Life and Truth that is eternal and unchangeable. And as it was in the beginning, even so it is and shall be in the day of restauration of all things by Jesus Christ,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40229:4"/>
who is, and was, and is to come, the Almighty; <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mega,</hi> the first and the last, the true and faithful Witness, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all true witness-bearing. But Man being in honour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued not; for the Serpent being more subtile than any Beast of the field, deceived the Woman with his limitted sence and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which he then gave to the positive Word and Command of God (even as the spirit that now ruleth in all the Chileren of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, with his limitted sense and commodious interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (as they are called) of the Scriptures of Truth, doth deceive the simple that lends an ear unto him) and thereby brought her then (as that spirit doth people now) into the transgression of the Word and Command of God, unto which no man ought to add any thing, neither to diminish ought therefrom, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 18, 19. <hi>And the Woman having eaten of that which</hi> in its self <hi>was good</hi> (and therefore <hi>not intrinsically evil,</hi> mark that) <hi>gave unto her Husband with her, and he did eate</hi>; who having eaten contrary to the Word and Command of God, sin entered into the world, and the world into mans heart, and death by sin, the first ground or cause of unbelief: And now in that day (the Candle of the wicked being put out) Death and Darkness passed over the Life and Truth of God in Man; so that the Word and Truth of God (the ground of true witness-bearing) which was and is Eternal (not Moral) was hid from their eyes who had sinned; And now Man being deprived of the Glory of God, and ignorant of his Righteousness, went after his own Inventions, so that as it is written, <hi>Death reigned from</hi> Adam <hi>until</hi> Moses, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. And now in that day the Lord had a Controversie with Man by reason of his sin: and Man in his sin, was in unbelief of the Word and Truth of God, the ground of true witness-bearing. Insomuch, as that in process of time, when Men began to be multiplied upon Earth, the wickedness of Men waxed great, so that they went into strife and contention one against another, until blood touched blood: And in this estate of Man, <hi>Abimelech</hi> King of <hi>Gerar,</hi> who was in the unbelief of the Word and Power of God, and observing that God was with <hi>Abram,</hi> he was afraid, as it is written, <hi>The workers of Iniquity are afraid, where no fear or cause thereof is,</hi> Psal. 53.4 5. and having a controversie against <hi>Abram</hi> concerning <hi>Sarah,</hi> Gen. 20.9. said unto <hi>Abram, Swear unto me
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40229:4"/>
here by God, That thou wilt not hurt me, nor my Children</hi>; Then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram</hi> (being afraid of his life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.12. and also having a controversie at that time with <hi>Abimelech,</hi> about a Well of water, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.22, 23, 24, 25.) said, <hi>I will Swear.</hi> And here was the first Oath or Swearing that is recorded in the Scriptures of Truth, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the original ground or cause thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> Unbelief the fruit of sin; and this was in time before the Lord is said to have sworn, and long before the Law was given: under which an Oath for confirmation was to be unto them (that were under that Law) an end of all strife, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. And an Oath and Swearing was also in long time after Witness-bearing; for we read, That <hi>Eve</hi> before the Fall, did bear witness concerning what the Lord had said, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.2, 3. And <hi>Sarah</hi> after the Fall (and in time before any Oath or Swearing) did call the Lord to witness, or judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt her and <hi>Abram,</hi> Gen. 16.5. without any Oath or Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So that witness-bearing was in the beginning before the Fall, and so in time, long before any oath or swearing was in the world. Afterwards the Lord proved <hi>Abram,</hi> who obeying the Word or Command of God, The Lord made a Promise unto <hi>Abram, That in his Seed all the Nations of the Earth should be blessed</hi>; and to shew to him, and his seed, the immutability of his Counsel, and to the end, that he and they might have strong consolation; The Lord by way of condescention to Man in his weakness (which by reason of transgression all men by nature were involved in) gave a token, as he had done to <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 9.12. and said, <hi>By my Self have I sworn, because thou hast not spared thine only son; therefore will I surely bless thee, and multiply thy Seed, and in thy Seed shall all the Nations of the Earth be blessed</hi>: And so the Lord added word to word, thereby to regain, or beget man into the belief of the truth of his Word and Promise; and that by two immutable things, wherein it was impossible for God to lye; man might have full assurance, that what the Lord had promised he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> yet notwithstanding, they believed not his Word, neither put their trust in his help (whom he had chosen out of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to place his Name among, and to be a peculiar People to himself) therefore their dayes he consumed in vanity, and their years in trouble, yet he helped them for his Name-sake, and made his Power known in their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and leading
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40229:5"/>
them through the Deep, and in the Wilderness, and yet they sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned still against him, and provoked the Highest in the wilderness, and tempted God in their hearts; Wherefore the Lord, because of their transgression, and that sin by the commandment might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come exceeding sinful, and that the offence might abound, <hi>Rom.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>.20. added the Law, called, The first Covenant or Testament, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. until the Seed should come, which was out of transgression (mark) to whom the Promise was made, which Seed is Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. who being come, the true and faithful Witness, the Oath and Promise of God made to <hi>Abraham</hi> was fulfilled and performed in him, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.72, 73. whom God had appointed to finish the transgressions, and to seal up the sins (that were under the first Covenant which was not faultless, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.7. for the Law made nothing perfect; but the bringing in of a better hope did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19.) and to bring in everlasting Righteousness, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. that they which are called, might receive the eternal Inheritance. So Christ being come, in whom all the Promises of God are Yea and <hi>Amen</hi> for ever; he was the end of the Law (which was added because of transgression, until he came that was out of transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) for Righteousness to all that believe, by whose obedience, many were, are, and shall be made Righteous through Faith. But the Law is not of Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. neither was given for a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man (mark that) but to the lawless and disobedient, I <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9, 10. And therefore what the Law saith, it faith to them that are under it, <hi>viz.</hi> to the transgressions and disobedient, &amp;c. But Christians in Christ Jesus, and in the Faith of him, are new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and therefore are not under the Law of a carnal Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was peculiar to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> but under the Law of the Spirit, and of Faith, the power of an endless life, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.16. And as the Law was not given for a righteous man, so neither was it given to the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> For God shewed his Word unto <hi>Iacob,</hi> his Statutes and his Judgments unto <hi>Israel</hi>; He dealt not so with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Nation, neither had the Heathen knowledge of his Laws, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147.19, 20. And therefore as <hi>Allan Smalwood</hi> faith of the Judicial Laws, as he calls them; I may say of the whole Law, written (whether by Men called Moral, Judicial or Ceremonial) that it was never obligatory to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> neither to us, who by nature are no <hi>Iewes,</hi> nor ever dwelt in <hi>Canaan</hi>; And so what was

never imposed, need not to be abolished as to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> neither to us; but Swearing was never commanded by God unto the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> as any part of his Worship and Service, therefore as to them and us, who by Nature are no <hi>Iewes,</hi> nor ever dwelt in <hi>Canaan,</hi> it was never Obligatory. So that <hi>A.S.</hi> and all that plead for Oaths and Swearing, with all their Arguments drawn from the authority of that which they call the Moral Law, are overthrown, and will not avail them, to prove the lawfulness of Swearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us of these Islands, who by Nature have descended from the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and not from the <hi>Iewes</hi>: And therefore <hi>A. S.</hi> is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of blame, in going about to lay a yoke (which neither the Fathers nor we were able to bear) upon them, which from among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are turned unto God, and are become Christians in Christ Jesus, which the Lord never required nor laid upon them, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. For what the Lord required of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest in them, for God himself shewed it unto them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. So that they also who amongst the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were unfaithful to, and in that which they knew of God, were likewise left without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, as it is written, <hi>As many as have sinned without the Law, shall perish without the Law; and as many as have sinned in the Law shall be judged by the Law,</hi> Rom. 2.12. And as to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> to whom the Law was peculiarly given, and so were under it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what the Law said, it was to them that were under it; <hi>When the fulness of time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, made under the Law, that he might redeem them that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, that they might receive the adoption of sons,</hi> Gal. 4.4. That so both <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> without respect of persons, might receive in Christ the blessing promised to <hi>Abram</hi> (when he was in uncircumcision) through the righteousness of Faith, and not through the Law which is not of Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. And so as its written, <hi>The Promise is sure to all the seed, and not to that only which is of the Law; but also to that which is of the Faith of</hi> Abraham, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. although they were never under the Law of any car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal commandment, nor never dwelt in <hi>Canaan:</hi> For all who are of Christ, they are <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, and heirs according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. And so he is our peace, who hath made both Jew and Gentile one, and hath broken down the middle Wall of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition betwixt them, having abolished in his flesh the enmity, the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40229:6"/>
Law of Commandments, contained in the Law written, That so both Jew and Gentile, through him, might have access unto the Father by one Spirit (and not by Swearing, or observing any carnal Commandment) and might worship the Father who is a Spirit, not in the oldness of the letter, but in the newness of the Spirit, the Law and Power of the endless Life (which was in the beginning with God, before any Oath or Swearing was) from which Word and Power of God that is Eternal (not Moral) Man departed when he sinned; And as Christ is our Peace, he is also our Peace-maker, by taking away sin, and finishing transgression, the ground or cause of the Controversie betwixt God and Man, and one man with another, and bringing into the Heart everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Righteousness, he reconcileth man unto God, and one man unto another, turning the hearts of the Fathers to the Children, and the disobedient, to the wisdom of the Just. And Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus coming to do the will of God, he fulfilled the Law, which could not in any wise pass away till it was fulfilled, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18. and having fulfilled the Law (not destroyed it) as he that fulfills and performs his Covenant in every particular, he doth not destroy it; although the Covenant once fulfilled, is no longer obligatory to him that hath fulfilled it) according to the will of God who gave the Law, he took it away, or out of the way, and disanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the first Covenant or Testament written in Tables of Stone, that he might establish the second, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.9. called the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, written not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the Living God; not in Tables of Stone, but in fleshy Tables of the Heart, according to 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. &amp; 10.16. And in that he saith a new Covenant, he hath abrogated the old Covenant or Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.13. For being Testaments, they were not be of force both together, the latter being in its self a revocation of the former; and where a Testament is revoked, there every Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy or Gift therein contained, is also revoked and taken away, and not some particulars only, but the whole; which Testament, or Covenant, is established upon better Promises, That so <hi>what was impossible for the Law or first Testament to do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:40229:6"/>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2, 3. And thus Christ Jesus, according to the will of God, having fulfilled the Law (not destroyed it) which was not of Faith, and therefore was not to abide for ever: And the end of God in giving the Law (which was but to continue for a time, as a School-master to bring to Christ) being accomplished in Christ, he took away the Law or first Testament (that made nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19.) which was not of Faith, being changeable; and in the stead or place thereof, he established the second Testament or new Covenant, upon better promises, which perfecteth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them that are Sanctified, according to <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.9. which being the Law of Faith, is unchangeable and abideth for ever: So that Christ Jesus the Mediator of the New Testament, the faithful dispenser of the manifold Graces of God, unto all that believe, came not only to reform the abuses of the Scribes and Pharisees, in Swearing, in the Temple, in the first Priesthood, and other things under the first Covenant; but also to take away the things that were changeable which they had so abused; and in the stead and place of them, to establish that which is unchangeable, the New Testament, upon better promises, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. And in that he faith a New Testament, he hath abrogated the Old, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.13. And therefore when Christ Jesus (the true and faithful Witness was come, who was to restore all things as in the beginning) was set down on the Mountain, and his Disciples (whom he had chosen out of the World to be his Witnesses) came to him, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make known unto them that were to bear witness of him, the true Witness-bearing, as it was in the beginning, before any Oath or Swearing was; amongst other his gracious words, he said unto them (who were of the Jews, and then were come to be his Disciples) and not to the multitude, <hi>Ye are the Salt of the Earth, ye are the Light of the World; let your Light so shine before men, that they seeing your good Works, may glorifie your heavenly Father.</hi> And that they being Iews, might not be offended at what he was to say unto them; He told them, <hi>He was not come to destroy the Law or the Prophets, but to fulfil them:</hi> And <hi>that not one jot or tittle should pass from the Law, till it should be fulfilled</hi> (mark that.) In which words is plainly shewed, That as the Law was fulfilled by Christ, it was to pass away, being only given by God, and added because of transgression for a time, <hi>viz.</hi> till the Seed should come, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40229:7"/>
was out of transgression, and so the Law being temporary, was changeable: And having so prepared their minds, he told them among other Precepts in the Law, <hi>That it had been said of old time, Thou shalt not for swear thy self, but shalt perform thine Oaths to the Lord: But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by Heaven, for it is the Throne of God; neither by the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but let your yea be yea; nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these, cometh of evil,</hi> Mat. 5.34. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By which words, (which are the interpreters of the heart) it is evident that the Oaths which they were under the Law to perform unto the Lord, and which Christs words had reference unto, were such Oaths as were required by the Law; and those Oaths the Law required, were by the Lord, and not by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for all swearing by the Creatures was by the Law forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: Which being so, then the words following, <hi>But I say unto you,</hi> (who were to be Lights of the World) <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> must needs be a prohibition of all Swearing by the Lord. And that he added, <hi>Neither by Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. Christ giveth a reason for the same, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.22. where he faith, <hi>He that sweareth by Heaven, he swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the Throne of God, and by Him that sitteth thereon</hi>; who is the Lord: And therefore as they were not to swear by the Lord, so neither might they swear by Heaven, it being Gods Throne, which would amount to swearing by God, that sitteth thereon: <hi>Neither by the Earth, neither by Jerusalem, neither by the Head</hi>; which being the greatest of the Creatures, the prohibition includeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the lesser.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is evident (<hi>none of Christs words being spoken in vain</hi>) That Christ Jesus did not onely forbid all swearing by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but also by the true God: For if there had been any excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion intended by Christ the Wisdom of God, he doubtless would have mentioned it, as well as he did vers. 32. where it's said, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever shall put away his Wife, except it be for fornication, causeth her to commit adultery,</hi> &amp;c. For an Oath and Swearing not being in the beginning with God, nor originally of him, (as true witness-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was) but being added (because the true witness-bearing was transgressed) for a time, <hi>viz.</hi> until Christ Jesus the true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Witness, and ground of all true witness bearing, was made manifest, to restore the true witness-bearing, as it was at the first. Now Christ being come, and having chosen his Disciples out of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40229:7"/>
world to be his Witnesses, and to place and restore the true wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness-bearing unto and amongst them, whom he had appointed to be Lights and good Examples unto the World; he therefore took away Swearing, which was not of Faith, but was added because of transgression, as before is said, and as being more than Yea and Nay; that he might restore and place the true witness-bearing, which is of Faith, and therefore to abide in the House, and among the Houshold of God for ever. For it is evident from the words of Christ, (where he saith, <hi>Let your yea, be yea; and your nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these, cometh of evil</hi>) that swearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than yea and nay, the original ground or cause thereof in man, came of the evil, and not of the good, in man. And thus Christ Jesus, having forbidden all swearing whatsoever, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, and taken away the first ground or cause thereof, in his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, he according to the will and promise of God, in the place and stead thereof, restored the pure Language, the Word of Faith, which is the Word of Truth that was in the beginning; by the Light of which, every one that believeth with his Heart, cometh to know the Truth, and so to do the Truth, to confess and speak the Truth from his Heart unto his Neighbour, or before a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate in witness-bearing. And this Witness, being of God, will not lye, and is therefore the greater Witness, which every one that believeth hath in himself, according to 1 <hi>Iob.</hi> 5.9, 10. And the Testimony that is born from this, and according to this word of Truth in the heart in witness-bearing, is in Truth, in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and in Judgement, being from and according to a good understanding. And as the Truth (which is in Christ, the Wisdom and Power of God) in mans heart, is believed in, it doth purifie and make clean the heart, by taking away sin and unbelief out of the heart, and so reconcileth it unto God, and one man unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And now the Testimony that is born according to the truth in the heart, is that which God hath appointed to end all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie and Strife amongst men; for now it is the Spirit that bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth witness, because the Spirit is Truth, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.6. And it is the Spirit of Truth which leads into all Truth, and so from all Oaths, Shadows, and Swearing, in witness-bearing; which having but a shadow, and not the substance of true witness-bearing, when the substance was come, the shadows were to pass away: So what
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40229:8"/>
Christ Jesus received of his Father, that he made known to his Disciples, as he said, <hi>Iob.</hi> 17.8. <hi>I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me, and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and have believed that thou hast sent me.</hi> Insomuch as the Apostle <hi>Iames,</hi> when he writ his Epistle to the Tribes which were scattered abroad, he put them in mind, being Jews, not Gentiles, of that Precept of Christ, where he saith, <hi>Above all things, my Brethren, swear not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.12. Not that Swearing was a greater offence than Murder or Adultery: But they, being Jews (and not Gentiles) by nature, had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God under the Law to swear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were apt to think they might as well swear then, as they might before. (Not at that time being so fully informed that <hi>Christ Iesus was the end of the Law for Righteousness to them that believe in him; and that by him all that believe are justified from all things from which they could not be justified by the Law of Moses,</hi> Act. 13.39.) For many among the Jews which then believed, were at that time zealous of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>; insomuch as there were of them, that taught the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>That except they were circumcised, and kept the Law of Moses, they could not be saved,</hi> Act. 15. &amp; 21.20. So that although Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Murder were as great sins as Swearing, yet the Law (which they were zealous of) having forbidden the one, and required the other, it was more difficult to bring them off from Swearing, than from Murder or Adultery. And therefore as it's usual amongst men, to exhort those they are to watch over, above all things to take heed of those evils they have been most addicted to, and of those things they have been trained up in; even so the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them, being Jews, to remember the Command of Christ in whom they believed, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> &amp;c. And although it be now concluded that Christ Jesus did intend by those words, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> an absolute, universal, and unlimited prohibition of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Swearing whatsoever, (as indeed it must be either all Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that was formerly commanded, or else Christ in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand forbid nothing which was not forbidden before; nay, by those words, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> he made the case about Swearing more questionable, dark, and doubtful, than it was before; which for any to affirm, were a great injury to Christ, the Wisdom and Power of God. And yet Christ Jesus, in forbidding all manner
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40229:8"/>
of Swearing whatsoever, did nothing but according to the will of his heavenly Father: Nor did the Apostle <hi>Iames,</hi> in putting the Jews in mind of his Masters Command, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> any thing in opposition, but in obedience to the requiring of Christ.</p>
            <p>And now of the things before written, this is the sum, That an Oath and Swearing was not in the beginning with God, neither was the original ground or cause of an Oath &amp; Swearing, of God. And therefore neither was nor is an Oath or Swearing, any part of the Law eternal, nor of the essence of the worship and service of God, in Spirit and Truth. But the original ground or cause of an Oath and Swearing amongst men in the World, was the Unbelief of Man, (in God, his Word, and Truth) of which, Transgression was the first ground or cause, which not being any fruit of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, (as true witness-bearing is) entred into the World, and the World into Mans heart, by sin and death. And therefore an Oath and Swearing is not any part of the worship and service of God now, under the Spirits immediate Administration. And the Law, having but a shadow of good things then to come, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could never make the Comers thereunto perfect, as the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of a better Hope doth: And so Christ Jesus the true and faithful Witness, that ends the Controversie between God and Man, being the End of the Law, (under which the Oath for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation was to be unto them that were under it, an end of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie and strife amongst men) for Righteousness, to all that believe; which Law, not being of Faith, was to be taken away, or out of the way, when Faith was come; which was before the Law (which is not of faith) was given, or any Oath or Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was. For as the Love of God to <hi>Israel</hi> appeared, in giving them his Laws and Statutes, notwithstanding they could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish their eternal Peace and Happiness, by reason of the weakness of the flesh; neither could be taken away, nor they freed therefrom, until they were fulfilled, and the end accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished for which they were given; Even so the Riches of the Love of God appeared in sending forth his Son (to effect that which the Law could not do for man, neither could man free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from) who being manifested in the
flesh, the Oath and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God was fulfilled in him: And to as many as received, and do receive him, by believing in his Word, which is night in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40229:9"/>
the heart, to do thereafter, the heart cometh to be purified, and made clean, and being prepared by the Lord, cometh to witness and feel the Love and Power of God, to quicken it, and enable it to every good work: So that <hi>a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things,</hi> Mat. 12.35. Speaking the Truth to, and witnessing the Truth for his Neighbour, according to and from a good understanding. And thus the righteousness of the Law cometh to be fulfilled by Christ in us, who walk not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Flesh, but according to the Spirit; and the end of God in giving the Law accomplished; according as it's written, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. <hi>The end of the Law is love out of a pure heart, and of a good Conscience, and of Faith unsained</hi>: So that the Law which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired an Oath in witness-bearing, nor any other part of the Law, by Christ, or any that are of him, is not frustrated, neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, but the righteousness of the Law by true witness-bearing, is fulfilled: And being fulfilled, was by Christ, according to the will of God, disanulled, abrogated, abolished, and taken out of the way, with all Oaths, Swearing, and Signs, that were required by it: And in the stead and place thereof, the Law of the Spirit and of Faith, the true witness-bearing, as it was in the beginning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Oath or <hi>Swearing</hi> was, established by Christ in the House of God for ever. By which Law of Faith, the Victory over the World, <hi>Sin,</hi> and Unbelief, cometh to be witnessed, the first ground or cause of <hi>Swearing</hi> in the World. And now the Righteousness of God (without the Law written, which is not of Faith) is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested (by the Light of Christ that shineth in mans heart, for to give unto man the knowledge of the things that are immediate of the Spirit, and therefore are spiritual, <hi>not moral</hi>) being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21. And is not now called the Works of the Law, but the Fruits of the Spirit; which, as the Apostle faith, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.9. is in all Goodness, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and Truth: And <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23. is <hi>Love, Ioy, Peace, Long suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness, Temperance,</hi> &amp;c. And so the Cause being removed, the Effect ceaseth. From all which it is evident, That true Witness-bearing was before any Oath or Swearing was: And the Law that is Perfect and Eternal, was (though hid from their Eyes whose Minds were alienated from the Life and Light of God, because of the hardness of their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40229:9"/>
Hearts) before the Law in the Tables of Stone, was written: And the Lord was worshipped in Spirit and Truth, before any Oath or Swearing was: And therefore an Oath and Swearing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, nor ever was, any part of the Law eternal, nor of Faith, neither any essential part of the Worship of God in Spirit and Truth, which is unchangeable and spiritual: So that the laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, or taking away of an Oath and Swearing in witness-bearing, is not to destroy witness-bearing, but the reducing it to its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Verity and Purity, as it was in the beginning, from all Oaths and Swearing; which was added for a time, to wit, till the true Witness Christ Jesus, and the true witness-bearing, was made manifest and restored, according to the Prophesies that were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of and concerning Christ: And as true witness-bearing, was in time, before any Oath or Swearing was, (and therefore an Oath and Swearing was not, neither is, of the essence and substance of true witness-bearing) even so the Truth was before any Lye; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Lyar is more ancient than the Swearer.</p>
            <p>Now these things being so, why should men professing God and Godliness, and Christianity, go about to continue an Oath and Swearing in witness-bearing under the Gospel, which is everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and was preached to <hi>Abraham</hi> before the Law of Oaths was, or any Swearing was commanded or required by God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. which had its beginning and ending in time, not being of the Law of Faith, that abideth for ever; and therefore was and is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, being of those things that might be shaken, and so to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: That true witness-bearing (which being of Faith, and therefore cannot be shaken) may remain.</p>
            <p>Therefore, O ye called Christians, let it not seem to you a thing so grievous, to have the Bondwoman (<hi>Unbelief</hi>) and her Son (<hi>Swearing</hi>) cast out; for assuredly it must not inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God with the Son of the Freewoman, (<hi>True Witness-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>)</p>
            <p>And now these things thus premised, being a true Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony concerning Oaths and Swearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I proceed to answer the subject matter contained and laid down in Twelve Arguments or Reasons, whereby <hi>Allan Smallwood</hi> hath endeavoured to prove (but in vain) that our Saviour did not forbid all Swearing, when he said unto his Disciples, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 5.34.</p>
            <div type="argument_and_answer">
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:40229:10"/>
               <head>Arg. 1.</head>
               <p>The first Argument (as it is stated by <hi>A. S.</hi> in his Reply to <hi>F. H.</hi> his Book intituled, <hi>Oaths no Gospel. Ordinance,</hi> &amp;c.) is,
<q>
                     <p>That the Father and the Son are one and the same God immutable in Nature and Will, (for mutability would argue imperfection) and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cannot issue forth contrary Commands, for that would evidence a contrariety or mutability in their Will: And the Father having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Swearing, the Son surely hath not forbidden it.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Argument runs thus:
<q>
                     <p>Whatever the Father hath commanded, that the Son hath not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden:</p>
                     <p>But the Father hath commanded Swearing,
<bibl>
                           <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13.</bibl>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore the Son hath not forbidden it.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Answer.</p>
               <p>And in the first place, I say, the Argument in this Case is not fairly stated.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That there is a difference between the Law of God which was and is eternal, and so unchangeable, as the Will of God in itself is; and the Commands of God under the Law, which was given to the People of <hi>Israel</hi> for a time onely, and so were temporary, to wit, till the Seed came to whom the promise was made, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 19. to be a Schoolmaster to bring them to Christ, that they might be justified by faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. But after the saith was come, they were no longer (by Gods ordination) to be under the Schoolmaster, <hi>vers.</hi> 25. So that when Christ the Seed, to whom the promise was made, was come, &amp;c had fulfilled all that was written concerning him in the Law, in the Prophets, and in the Psalms, the Law of Commandments that was not of faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. was to be taken out of the way, the end for which it was given being accomplished, according to the will of God. So that although God the Father commanded Swearing under the Law, till Christ the true and faithful Witness was made manifest in the flesh, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored the true Witness-bearing, as it was in the beginning before Swearing was, unto his Disciples, whom he had chosen out of the World to be his Witnesses; and that Christ Jesus the Son of God

in that Precept, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> did forbid all Swearing to his Disciples; yet there neither was, nor is any mutability or change in the Will of God, nor contrariety in the Will of the Son, to the Will of his Father; for what the Son did command, it was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Will of, and what he received of his Father: Now that Swearing was commanded by the Law <hi>A. S.</hi> confesseth; And that an Oath and Swearing was to pass away, or to be taken out of the way when the true Witness and Witness-bearing (was made manifest) which was before any Oath or Swearing was, is before fully manifested: So that the Argument in this case truly stated, runs thus; <hi>That what God the Father did command to his People <hi>Israel</hi> only for a time, and for such an end; the time being fully come, and the end accomplished, the Command so given, is no longer of force, nor obligatory.</hi> And therefore, there is in this case, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety or mutability in the Will of the Father, nor contrariety in the Will of the Son of God, to the Will of his Father, in that Command, <hi>Swear not at all</hi>: That Command of God the Father, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. which was temporary, being according to the Will of God, first taken out of the way, That the Command of Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34. might be established for ever, according to <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.9. <hi>He taketh away the first, that he might establish the second.</hi> And the Prophesie, <hi>Psal.</hi> 108. Judah <hi>is my Law-giver.</hi> That so the servant, who was not by God's appointment to abide in the house for ever, might give place to the Son, who is to abide in the house for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: And that God the Father did give several Commands only to be observed and to continue for a time without any mutability in his Will, is evident from the testimony of the Scriptures of Truth; As <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.2. where the Lord commanded <hi>Abram</hi> to take his only son <hi>Isaac</hi> and offer him for a burnt offering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in <hi>vers.</hi> 12. the Lord commanded him not to lay his hand upon the Child, neither do any thing unto him: And <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Ioseph was</hi> commanded, <hi>to take the Babe, and his Mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there till</hi> (mark) <hi>I bring thee word, &amp;c.</hi> And in <hi>vers.</hi> 19. <hi>When</hi> Herod <hi>was dead,</hi> he was commanded <hi>to take the Babe and his Mother, and go into the Land of</hi> Israel: And yet there was no change or contrariety in the Will of God, although there was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral and contrary Commands, the one, <hi>To flee into Egypt</hi>; and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40229:11"/>
the other, <hi>To return into the Land of Israel:</hi> So likewise, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it's said, <hi>That the Heir, as long as he is a Child, differeth nothing from a Servant, though he be Lord of all; but is under Tutors and Governors, until the time appointed of the Father.</hi> By which it is evident, That though <hi>Israel</hi> according to the Will of God was to be under the Law, which was not of Faith, for a time as a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; yet it was never the Will of God their condition should alwayes be so, but only until the time appointed: which time being come, they were to be freed from that Law, <hi>that they might receive the adoption of sons</hi>: For although the Lord had forbidden <hi>Moses,</hi> and all others, to add any thing to, or diminish any thing from what was written in the Law; yet He had not limitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self but that he might add to, or take from what he had given in command and that without any mutability in his Will: And if the Father at sundry times did give forth several Commands, and that contrary one to another, without any mutability in his Will (in that sense which <hi>A.S.</hi> doth affirm) Then the Son, who doth whatsoever he seeth the Father do; did not give forth that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> contrary to, but in obedience to the Will of his Father: For although the words of the Commands, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. in themselves are contrary, yet the Will of the Father, and the Son, was in perfect unity, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety: But the contrariety is in that mind that is Carnal, and therefore neither is, nor can be subject to the Law of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. which being in the Spirit, is Spiritual and Eternal, and not Moral.</p>
               <p>So that such now whose minds are alienated from the Light and Life of God, are ignorant of the Righteousness of God, as the Jews formerly were, who had <hi>Moses</hi> read in their Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues every Sabbath day (for where <hi>Moses</hi> is read, the vail is upon the heart to this day, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15.) so that such do not see now, no more than the Jews did then, the end of that which is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished: Nevertheless now as then, all whose minds are turned to the Lord, and believe in his Light that shines in their hearts for to give unto them the Knowledge of God in the face of Jesus Christ, and of the Law in the Spirit, written not in tables of stone, but in the heart; which Law was before the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:40229:11"/>
was written, or any vail was. They in the Light Eternal see the end of the Law, which was not of Faith; and the Law abolished, under which an Oath for confirmation was to be unto them that were under it, an end of all controversie and strife: And also in the Light that was before any Oath or Swearing was, they see and know the true and faithful Witness, Christ Jesus in them, from whom all true Witness-bearing is; and so the true Witness-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it was in the beginning, which no Vail, Shadow, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light can discern, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. And thus all who do the Will of God by believing in him whom God hath sent, they come to know Christs Doctrine, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> to be his that sent him, <hi>to be a Light to the Gentiles, and the Glory to his People Israel.</hi> And is it equal, O ye sons of men, That those whose eyes God hath opened, and unto whom God hath given the Light of Eternal Life, that they should be compelled to walk by the same guide, the blind are led by, in their witness-bearing? Would it not be a thing unreasonable, for to require him who hath his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect sight, when the Sun shines to shew him his way, to require him to have a man take him by the hand and lead him on his way, as the natural blind are led? Hath not the Lord in all Ages put a difference betwixt them that feared his Name, and trembled at his Word, and those that feared him not, but walked after the stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornness of their own hearts, and after their own inventions? And if the Lord hath so done, and so doth, ought not all those who are his Ministers upon Earth, to do the like?</p>
               <p>But <hi>A.S.</hi> further saith, <hi>That Oaths are commanded by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, and that the Ten Commandments are the summary of it:</hi> And doth grant, <hi>That Oaths are no Gospel Ordinance.</hi> And also saith, <hi>That our Saviour came not to destroy, but fulfil the Moral Law; And therefore Swearing, being enjoyned by the Moral Law, must be now of as much force as ever it was.</hi> He also affirmeth, <hi>That Christ did not abolish the Iudicial and Ceremonial Law, once commanded by God; because the one was peculiarly given to the Iews, and so concerns us not at all: And the other was temporary, expiring at Christ's Death, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If Christ did not abolish the Judicial nor Ceremonial Law, as they are called and distinguished by <hi>A. S.</hi> Then it must needs follow, and be granted; That Christ did abolish, abrogate, disanul, take away, or out of the way, the Law which <hi>A. S.</hi> calls Moral; or else Christ abolished no Law at all: But it is evident from the plain testimony of the Scriptures of Truth before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.13. &amp; 10.9. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7, 11. That Jesus Christ did abolish, abrogate, disannul, take away, or out of the way, the Law of Commandments contained in the Law written, the old or first Covenant or Testament, the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of Ordinances, the Ministration of Death written with letters, and engraven in stones; And therefore, If Christ (as <hi>A. S.</hi> hath affirmed) did not abolish the Judicial and Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Laws; Then, as is before said, it must of necessity follow and be concluded, That Christ Jesus did abolish, abrogate, disannul, take away, or out of the way that Law which <hi>A. S.</hi> calls Moral: For the Scriptures testimony in the places before mentioned; are either true or false. To say they are false, is blasphemy; because they were written by Divine Inspiration, and the infallible gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Spirit of Truth: And therefore being true; Then that Law (which <hi>A. S.</hi> calls Moral, of which he also affirmeth an Oath and Swearing to be a part, or required by) was by Christ abolished, abrogated, disannulled, taken away or out out of the way: And the Law by which Swearing was commanded being abolished, All Oaths and Swearing commanded or required by that Law, must of necessity be abolished with the Law. Now these things being so, All the Arguments and Distinctions, with all the Conclusions and clouds of Witnesses that <hi>A. S.</hi> hath laid down, made and brought in, to prove the lawfulness of some Swearing now under the Gospel, from the Authority of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, as he calls it, are made void, and are become of none effect. And therefore <hi>A. S.</hi> is worthy of blame, in affirming so confidently, That if Swearing be enjoyned by the Moral Law, it must be of as much force now as ever: And it may be of concern to <hi>A. S.</hi> before he begin his History of Oaths, that he find out some other Law of God, than that he call Moral, to ground the lawfulness of Oaths upon, lest he build upon a sandy Foundation;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40229:13"/>
and so labour in vain; For himself acknowledgeth (in pag. 303. of his <hi>Reply</hi> to <hi>F.H.</hi>) it was a certain truth, That Christ gave no new Command in matters of Oaths, nor in any other, more than what was formerly enjoyned in the Moral Law. And besides, in his <hi>Epistle to the Reader,</hi> he saith, <hi>That no Orthodox man had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver said, That Oaths were ever any Gospel Ordinance,</hi> (or to that effect) but on the contrary their Tenent is, That they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Moral Law; which Law being abolished (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is proved) by Christ, and no other Law of God being found that requires Swearing under the Gospel; but on the contrary, a positive Law of Christ given to his Disciples, <hi>Not to swear at all</hi>; It cannot be of any service to the Lord, or his People, to write such a History: But rather to exhort People to mind the fear of the Lord, and to have a regard to all his Commands, which being in the Spirit, that helps the infirm, are not grievous; and to walk in the Light of the Lord, that they may have no occasion of stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at the Command of Christ, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> For as it were a sin, to deny obedience to any Ordinance or Command of God in its time; even so it is a sin also, for any to use or practise any Command of God as a part of his worship &amp; service, for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, or longer time, that it was given for, or ordained by God. Which Errour, Christians have justly condemned in the Jews, for holding up for Ordinances and Commands of God (Circumcision, Passeover, Temple, the seventh Day Sabbath, and many other things required and commanded by God in the Law, or first Testament, as Oaths and Swearing was under the first Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament commanded the Jews) after that Christ Jesus was ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his Father, and had sent the Spirit of Truth to lead his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples into all Truth; which Truth being the substance of all Oaths, Shadows, Types, Figures, and Signs, that were under the Law, which had but a shadow of the good things to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1. Which when <hi>David</hi> in the Light of the Lord, had manifested to him (he being a Prophet) in which Light he saw Light, even the Law, whereof the Lord had said unto him, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee,</hi> Psal. 2.7. He then said (having seen the end of that which was to be abolished) that in burnt Offerings and Sacrifices the Lord took no delight, neither had pleasure
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40229:13"/>
therein; <hi>Sacrifice and Offerings, thou wouldest not, but a body hast ordained me; in Offerings and Sin Offerings thou hast no pleasure, Heb.</hi> 10.5, 6. So that although such as do not the Will of God, do not see the end of that which is abolished, neither know Christs Doctrine; yet all who do believe in him, whom God hath sent a Light into the World, they know the Doctrine of Christ, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> to be of God, and according to godliness, <hi>Iob.</hi> 7.16, 17.</p>
               <p>But to proceed to <hi>A. S.</hi> his second Argument, which runs thus;</p>

                  <p>Whatsoever at all times, as well under the Gospel as under the Law, tends in an especial manner to the glory of God, that is neither Ceremonial nor forbidden by Christ.</p>
                  <p>But some Swearing at all times as well under the Gospel, as under the Law, tends in a special manner to the glory of God.</p>
                  <p>And therefore all Swearing, is neither a Ceremonial Ordinance, nor forbidden by Christ.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> God is not now, nor ever was glorified in an especial manner by his Creatures, but as they did and do obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and so do the thing he requireth of them: As it's written, <hi>Obedience is better than Sacrifice, and to do the will of God is better than the fat of Rams.</hi> And although it be granted that some Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring under the Law did tend to the glory of God, as done in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his requiring; yet it doth not follow that now under the Gospel, any swearing doth tend in an especial manner to the glory of God; because the Law in or by which it was commanded, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is proved, is abolished; and swearing now forbidden by Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34. to all his Disciples. And again, as hath been before proved, Swearing was never any essential part of the worship of God in Spirit and Truth, because it was not any part of the Law Eternal, neither in the beginning with God, nor originally of him; as the true witness-bearing was. And therefore swearing under the Gospel, not being required, but forbidden by Christ, without whom no man can glorifie God, doth not tend in an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner to the glory of God, as the true witness-bearing doth; so that this Argument, and the conclusion thereupon made, is of no force, to prove any swearing to tend in an especial manner
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40229:14"/>
to the glory of God: But to do truth, confess the truth, and to speak the truth in witness-bearing, or in our communications, doth not only tend to the glory of God, but also to the benefit of our Neighbour; and is therefore acceptable unto God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto Men.</p>
               <p>And so I proceed to the third Argument, which is this,</p>

            <div type="argument_and_answer">
               <head>Arg. 3.</head>
               <q>
                  <p>If Christ forbad Swearing, Then it was either because it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to our duty to God, or repugnant to our duty to our Neighbour.</p>
                  <p>But some Swearing, is neither repugnant to our duty to God, (whose glory in sundry particulars it advanceth) nor repugnant to our duty to our Neighbour, to whom thereby much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage may accrue in several respects.</p>
                  <p>And therefore Christ forbad not all Swearing.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This Argument is framed much like the question put to Christ, concerning the man that was blind from his birth; <hi>Who did sin, this man or his Parents, that he was born blind?</hi> To which question, Jesus answered, <hi>Neither hath this man sinned, nor his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; but that the work of God might be made manifest.</hi> So I may say, What if Christ forbad swearing, neither because it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to our duty to God, nor to our Neighbour; but that the Work, Power, and Will of God might be made manifest in and by Christ, and to make known unto his Disciples, <hi>That all power in Heaven and Earth was committed unto him,</hi> Mat. 28.18. And that as he had power to take away, He had also power to give, alter, and change Laws, the Government being laid upon his shoulders, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9.6. to whom also all Judgment was committed. But for further Answer, I say, whatever is acted by man as an essential part of the worship and service of God, which the Lord doth not require, is repugnant to our duty to God, and so hath the Lord testified in all ages, as appears <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. <hi>Ier.</hi> 14.11, 12, 13. <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.10, <hi>&amp;c. Mat.</hi> 15.8, 9. But swearing under the Gospel, the Lord hath not required, but forbidden, as before is proved: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is repugnant to our duty to God (whom we are to obey, and our superiours in him, and for him) and being repugnant to our duty to God, it cannot be truly advantagious to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40229:14"/>
whom we are to love as our selves. Again, there is nothing of advantage can accrue to our Neighbour by swearing, which true witness-bearing doth not fully supply where it is received: Nay, there is much more surety to our Neighbour by true witness-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (than by swearing) because a true witness will not lye.</p>
               <p>The fourth Argument is thus formed:</p>

                  <p>That interpretation of our Saviours words, Swear not at all, which renders the following words vain, and impertinent, is false &amp;c.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That Christ intended what he said, I hope no Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an will deny: And that those words, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> were spoken by Christ, and are in themselves a prohibition of all swearing whatsoever, is evident: And that they were spoken by Christ (not by way of compliance with what had been said before to them of old time) but in the contrary thereof, is apparent by the words; <hi>But I say unto you, Swear not at all:</hi> Which words, if they signifie nothing but what was before said, Then should they not only be to no purpose, but hurtful, by making the case of swearing more dark and questionable than it was before under the Law: which for any man to affirm, were a great injury to Christ Jesus, the Wisdom of God; And therefore Christ having spoken all those words, <hi>But I say unto you, Swear not at all, neither by Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> And that in the contrary of what was said before, as the word <hi>but,</hi> (and the words) <hi>not at all,</hi> do import: It is manifest that Christ did in that command, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> forbid somewhat that was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the Law: And consequently, all swearing whatsoever, whether by the Lord, or by the Creatures; And that Christ added neither by Heaven, the Earth, Jerusalem, the Head, they being the chiefest of the visible Creatures, all the other creatures being the lesser or inferiour are included, the greater comprehending the less; so that the words following, and precedent, are all signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant and useful: For being the words of Christ, not any of them are to be rejected; but all and every word established: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were more beseeming Christians, to give all diligence to observe the Law, and Command of Christ; then to invent and frame Arguments against his words, which are in themselves plain, and have no ambiguity in them; and being so according to the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40229:15"/>
rule, when in words there is no ambiguity, there no Exposition is to be made against the words expressed: For in doubtful speech we utter not a doubtful sence, but only that which we mean; Therefore, he which speaketh one thing, and meaneth another, neither doth he utter that which the word signifieth, because he meaneth not so, neither that which he meaneth, because he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it not: Which for any man to affirm of the words of Christ, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> were, as before is said, a great injury to Christ, the Wisdom of God, and to the Spirit of Truth, from which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Truth were given forth. All which words of Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in themselves prohibitions of Swearing, and no exceptions (as the words of Christ in the case of Divorcement were, where it's said, <hi>Except for the cause of Fornication</hi>) do the more confirm and illustrate the extent of the Command. And being the words of Christ, the Wisdom of God, they are neither vain nor imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, No more than those words in the fourth Commandment, <hi>In it thou shalt do no manner of work, nor thy Son, &amp;c.</hi> All which were included in those general words before-going, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy:</hi> Or the enumerating all those words written in the Tables of Stone, which were all briefly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in those few words, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart; 'And thy Neighbour as thy self.</hi> And yet the Wisdom of God, which is wiser than men, knowing whereof we, as men, have need, spoke all those words in the Law. And where the Law-giver hath made no exception, he to whom the Law is given ought not. And so I conclude, That the Law of Christ, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> is perfect, and a full prohibition of all swearing unto his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; and being perfect, no man ought to add any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, or diminish any thing from it. And so I proceed to the fifth Argument.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The thing in Dispute is not, Whether Christ did ever forbid any thing that was not of it self evil? But, whether Christ
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40229:15"/>
hath forbidden all Swearing? Which that Christ hath forbidden all swearing, his own words (which are the interpreters of the heart) do prove. And one single testimony of the Scriptures of Truth, is of more strength than a thousand surmises, or meer hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane witnesses. And therefore Swearing being forbidden by Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34. it is the duty of Christians to apply themselves to yield obedience to his Command, and not to frame Arguments to evade the same, or to ask a Reason wherefore he so did: And yet we read, That God commanded Circumcision and Sacrifices, which in themselves are not evil, and yet forbidden in the New Covenant: And we also read, That God forbad <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil</hi>; which Tree and its Fruit of themselves, were not intrinsically evil. And the use of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Creatures, under the Law, was forbidden the People of <hi>Israel.</hi> And what God the Father did forbid, it was by his Word; And Christ, the Word and Power of God, he forbid his Disciples to go into the way of the Gentiles, and not to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any of the Cities of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> Mat. 10.5. And he charged his Disciples <hi>they should tell the Vision to no man, until, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 17. 9. And that they should <hi>call no man Master upon the Earth,</hi> Mat. 23. 9. None of which of themselves were intrinsically evil. But that which concerns us as Christians, and so under the Law of Christ, is not so much to enquire, whether or no, such a thing be good in or of it self; But whether or no it be good for us to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, yea or nay? For, as said the Apostle, <hi>What is not of Faith is Sin:</hi> And therefore, that is good for Christians to do, which the Lord requires of them. But to proceed to the sixth Argument; the force whereof is this:</p>

contrary thereto, when he said, <hi>God is my witness,</hi> or called God to witness, is denied: For as he knew Christ had forbidden all swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, he also knew that Christ was the true and faithful Witness, the first and the last, and came to restore the true witness-bearing as at the first (which was and is the Righteousness of the Law of Oaths:) And the Apostle being an able Minister of the Spirit, not of the Letter, he was come to see the End of that which was abolished, and preached the everlasting Gospel, the word of Faith, which was and is the Word of Truth, the Author of true witness-bearing, which was before any Oath or Swearing was. And so as Christ, his Lord and Master had done before, when he said unto <hi>Pilate, For this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the Truth,</hi> Joh. 18.37. He in obedience to his Lord and Master, did bear witness to, and of the Truth: And in witness-bearing did (as the Servants of the Lord do) call God to witness, or appeal to the witness of God in men, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the truth of what he declared, without observing any set forms of words: And as <hi>Sarai</hi> had done before, when she said unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram, The Lord judge betwixt thee and me</hi>; yet did not swear at all.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> because there is an attestation of the Name of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That the Name of God was used in witness-bearing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Oath or Swearing was, doth appear <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.3. where <hi>Eve</hi> before the Fall, in witness-bearing, used the Name of God, when she said, <hi>God hath said, Ye shall not eat, &amp;c.</hi> yet did not swear at all. And <hi>Sarai</hi> after the Fall did use an attestation of the Name of God in witness-bearing, when she said unto <hi>Abram, The Lord judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thee and me,</hi> Gen. 16.5. and yet <hi>Sarai</hi> did not swear at all in so doing. And therefore the calling of God to witness, or say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>God is my witness, &amp;c.</hi> without adding of somewhat more, is neither Oath nor Swearing. For if such attestations; or mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Name of God, without somewhat more, were swearing, then it would follow, That People did swear oftentimes in their Prayers; As when they use that expression, <hi>Oh God the Father of Heaven, &amp;c. O God make haste to help us, Amen, Amen, &amp;c.</hi> which for any to affirm, were a great injury to the People. Again, If a bare attestation of the Name of God, by what terms soever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, were an Oath and Swearing, without adding of some what
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40229:16"/>
more, Then would the Magistrates in Judicial proceedings in cases where an Oath and Swearing is by the Law required, receive such Attestations of the Name of God, without denying them for Oaths and Swearing. But such Attestations, or the like, without adding somewhat more, is denied by the Magistrates in Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial proceedings, &amp;c. Therefore they are no formal or legal Oaths without addition of somewhat more; which somewhat more, being more than yea and nay, cometh of evil. For it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed (and it is the chiefest ground, or cause, that is alleadged for the lawfulness of some swearing under the Gospel, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the ending of Controversies and Strife in Judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, &amp;c.) That if an Oath or Swearing were lawful in any case whatsoever, it must be in Judicial proceedings, &amp;c. And I do not find in the Scriptures of Truth, That any Oath was lawful, but in such proceedings, or the like emergent occasions: All vain, and prosane Oaths being forbidden by the Law: And as the lawful use of Oaths under the Law, was in legal or judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; so the definition or determination of what was a legal Oath or Swearing, and what was neither Oath nor Swearing, was by the Law, and the Ministers of it, and not by private or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men: For at this day, there are several kinds or forms of Oaths required by the National Laws; And yet the bare Attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Name of God, without addition of somewhat more, is not answerable to any of them, neither doth fully answer the requiring of the Law, as the daily practise of the Law in the Courts of Judicature doth manifest, which practice doth declare what a legal Oath is in the judgment of the National Laws: And for illegal Oaths, <hi>A. S.</hi> I hope will not contend. By which Laws also it doth appear, That the Law doth put a difference betwixt an Oath or Swearing, and Witness-bearing; and doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them together, as many men do. As for instance in one particular, When a Party, or a Witness doth appear to answer a Libel, or to give Evidence in the Ecclesiastical Courts; upon his Appearance in the Court, he is required to take his Oath; and then the Book being held, the Party having laid his hand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; some words being spoken to him by the Judge of the Court, and after the Party having kissed the Book, then is the Party said to be Sworn, or to have taken his Oath. And being so Sworn, he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40229:17"/>
is admonished to give in his Answer, or his Evidence, as the Case is, at or before such a time; so that the Evidence after given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Court, is the Witness-bearing (and not the Oath): which Evidence, or Answer (as the Case requires) if he neglect or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to give, he is proceeded against for refusing to give his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or Answer: And not as one that refuseth to Swear or take an Oath, he having Sworn or taken his Oath before; which Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, if given, is the Witness-bearing, and not the Oath. For if he refuse to swear, he is proceeded against for refusing to swear, although he offer to give his Evidence without swearing. So that the Evidence is the witness-bearing, and not the Oath; By which it doth appear, That an Oath is in, and of it self, a distinct thing from Witness-bearing (which was before any Oaths was) and is but a Bond or Tye for true Witness-bearing, and not the substance: For when the Evidence is given, if what is Evidenced be false, the Oath taken before or after, doth not make it true; And if it be truth that is Evidenced, the refusing to take or add an Oath, or give a Token, Sign, or Pledge, doth not detract any thing from it. By which it may appear to the unprejudiced in mind, That the laying aside of an Oath and Swearing (which was added for a time under the Law in witness-bearing, because men had trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed or gone from the Truth of God, which was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, before any Oath was) in witness-bearing, is not to destroy true witness-bearing, but the reducing it to its primitive purity, as it was in the beginning. So that the true Witness, Christ Jesus, being made manifest, all that believe in him and receive him, to them he gives power to become the Sons of God; and by his Spirit (which is Truth, and leads into all Truth) he enableth them, to do the Truth, confess the Truth, and speak the Truth from the heart unto their Neighbour, or before a Magistrate in witness-bearing; as it's written, <hi>A good man, out of the good trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in his heart, he bringeth forth good things.</hi> So that our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, if he receive our Testimony, being Truth, he is not damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by us; although we may not Swear at all, or give him any outward sign, or pledge, which cannot add any thing in Truth to the Truth which we are willing and free to bear Witness of, and unto, upon any just occasion; Neither can the Magistrate be more assured of the Truth of what is Evidenced, by an Oath, than by a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40229:17"/>
bare Affirmation: For as the one, so the other may be true or false: Again, I say, That not only our Neighbour is not preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced by us (because we may not add any sign, token, or pledge, to the Truth which we bear witness of and to) but he is by true witness-bearing more advantaged, than he is or can be by Swearing (when the Evidence born is not true) which neither is, nor ever was of the essence of true witness-bearing; Because true witness-bearing was before any Oath or Swearing was: For there may be and hath been many times Oaths and Swearing in Judicial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, when the Evidence given upon such Oaths have not been true, but false; and so men thereby have and do suffer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice. But when and where true witness is born and received, although an Oath be denied, or not given; yet hereby men are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged and receive benefit, and no prejudice at all; for where a true Testimony is born, there none ever did or can thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive loss. Again, Christ Jesus being come to restore and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish everlasting Righteousness in the new Covenant that is fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and so unchangable; And Oaths and Searing not being faultless, and so changeable; not being from everlasting, but added for a time, because of transgression, as is before said: It was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that all Swearing, with those things under the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, should be taken away, that were things in themselves chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and might be shaken; to the end, that true witness-bearing which could not be shaken, might be established in the House of God for ever. So that although, where <hi>Moses</hi> or the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is read, an Oath and Swearing, as a Vail, remains to this day undone away; yet nevertheless, all whose hearts and minds are turned to the Lord, in the Light that was before any Avail or Oath was, they see and witness the End of that which is aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: for, where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. And therefore the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> (having seen and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed the removing of those things which might be shaken, and knowing that when that which was perfect was come, that which was but in part was to be done away) he in witness-bearing said, <hi>God is my witness, I speak the Truth in Christ, I lye not, &amp;c.</hi> without adding any outward token, sign, or pledge; or observing any form of words at all: So that as he himself said, <hi>He became as without
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40229:18"/>
Law, to them that were without Law,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.21. yet was he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Law of Christ, and did not <hi>Swear at all.</hi> And as he did not himself swear, so neither did he teach swearing to be lawful by way of Doctrine to the Hebrews, when he said, That an Oath is among them for an end of all strife and controversie, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. which words he spoke, not by way of Doctrine, as a thing to be practised by them as Christians; but by way of repeating, what formerly had been used amongst the Jews, under the first Covenant, and so that he might shew unto them being Jews, how that by Christ, the first Testament was taken away, or out of the way: and the second established upon better promises: For as he said of Swearing, he also said of the Priesthood, That <hi>every High Priest is</hi> (not was) <hi>ordained to offer, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 8 3. <hi>And that after the second Vail, was the Tabernacle, which is</hi> (not was) <hi>called the Holiest of all,</hi> Heb. 9.3. <hi>And when Moses had spoken every Precept to the People according to the Law, he took the blood of Calves, saying, This is</hi> (not was) <hi>the blood of the Testament which God hath appointed to you,</hi> Heb. 9.19, 20. All which his sayings do plainly shew, That what he had in those particulars mentioned, was by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating what had been in use under the first Covenant; and not by way of Doctrine, what they were to practise then as Christians. But I proceed to the seventh Argument, which as <hi>A. S.</hi> saith in brief runs thus;</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40229:18"/>
given, was accomplished; which being accomplished according to the Will of God, was abolished, abrogated, disannulled, and taken away by Christ, as before is fully proved. Now, as said the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.3, 4. <hi>The Woman which is in subjection to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, is bound by his Law to him as long as he liveth; but if her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band be dead, she is delivered from his Law: So then, if while the man liveth she take another Husband, she shall be called an Adultress; but if the man be dead, she is free from the Law, so that she is no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultress though she take another Husband. Wherefore, my Brethren, ye also are become dead by the Body of Christ, that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.</hi> What words more plain to prove, That Christians in Christ Jesus, are freed from the Law of the carnal Commandment, that they may serve God in newness of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and not in the oldness of the letter, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. And though it be true that Christ came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it; yet that doth no more prove <hi>A. S</hi>'s Conclusion inferred thereupon, <hi>viz. Therefore Christ did not forbid all swearing, because some swearing was commanded in the Law</hi>; Then it doth, where a man is ingaged by his Bond to pay so much money upon such a day; and the man upon that day doth make payment of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney according to his Bond; That the man in so doing doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy his Boud, or that it is after Obligatory to him, when he hath fulfilled it. For although the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> to whom the Law was given by God, could not be freed therefrom until it was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled; yet notwithstanding when it was fulfilled, it was by the Ordination of God to pass away, and the People freed from it, as before is proved. So that when Christ Jesus had fulfilled the Law (not for himself) but for them that were under it, <hi>He Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed them that were under the Law, and so delivered them from the Law,</hi> Rom. 7.6. Gal. 4.5. <hi>that they,</hi> together with the Gentiles, that never were under the Law of the first Covenant, <hi>might receive</hi> in Christ <hi>the adoption of sons.</hi> Again, That the Law was perfect (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were denied that any swearing was enjoyn'd in the third Commandment) is witnessed, yea every word of God is perfect; because in the Law was fully contained so much of the Will and mind of God, as he was pleased to make known at that time unto
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40229:19"/>
his People <hi>Israel,</hi> and as he did require obedience unto, from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (secret things belongs unto God, and things revealed to us and our Children) no man being capable of knowing the whole Will and Mind of God. And yet, what man doth know of the Mind of God, by the manifestation of his Spirit, is perfect; because every measure of the Will of God, as every Word of God, is perfect: And the Law of God being perfect, therefore nothing is by man to be added thereto, or taken therefrom. Insomuch, as when <hi>the Israelitish Womans Son blasphemed the Name of God, and cursed</hi>; and there being at that time no positive punishment appointed by God in that case; he was put in hold, until the Lord himself shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto <hi>Moses</hi> what punishment was to be inflicted upon him, <hi>Levit.</hi> 24.11, 12, 13. So that <hi>Moses,</hi> who was a Prophet, did not take upon him to give any extensive interpretation to the Law (which being Penal to the transgressors, was not to be supplied by man, by way of implication or intendment) neither to say of it, That the Law before given by God was imperfect, because the whole Mind of God was not therein revealed, concerning all things that after might fall out by reason of Man's wickedness: Neither had the Lord, as <hi>A. S.</hi> would infer, limited himself to what before was written, but that he might and did, as he himself thought good, further add to what before was written, or take away from the same (and that without any mutability in his Will) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had forbidden <hi>Moses</hi> so to do. And besides, the Name of God was, and may be used with reverence and godly fear, many other wayes than by Swearing; And therefore this Argument fails in proof with the other.

It

being the Lord hath made us, and not we our selves. And it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asserted by <hi>A. S. That Christ never did any thing without reason.</hi> And proved, that Christ did say unto his Disciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34. <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> Therefore it ought to be granted, That Christ in forbidding all Swearing, did it not without reason: For if Christ Jesus in that Command did not forbid all Swearing whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Then it would follow, That men under the Gospel might have liberty not only to swear by the Creatures; but also if they should swear by the Name of God, and not perform, they should go unpunished; because <hi>where there is no Law, there is no transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> For the Law in which an Oath in some cases was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and forswearing, vain and prophane swearing by God and the Creatures, forbidden; being abolished and taken away by Christ, as before is proved: Unless Christ Jesus had forbidden all swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whatsoever, by a Command that changeth not, men would have thought themselves at liberty, not only to Swear by the true God, and not perform; but also to Swear by the Creatures, and that without any sin. And indeed it may justly be feared, That such pleading as hath of late been by some, for the lawfulness of some swearing, and such interpretations of Christs words as have been made, thereby to prove some swearing lawful, and that from those words of Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath encouraged some men in these dayes to such a height of swearing, as they are now come: And therefore Christ Jesus, the Wisdom of God, in giving forth that Command as a prohibition of all swearing, did it not without reason: And what is before said, may be a good reason wherefore Christ added those words, <hi>Neither by Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> after he had said, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> And so the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are neither vain nor impertinent. For under the Law they were to Swear by the Name of the Lord, and not by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: And by the Law they were required to perform their Oaths unto the Lord, which they swore by his Name, lest they should forswear themselves; which Christ having before repeated in substance, By way of opposition of, and not in compliance with, said, <hi>But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> So that the words truly considered, are thus in effect; <hi>But I say unto you, Swear not at all by the Name of the Lord, as heretofore
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40229:20"/>
under the Law you were commanded; neither by Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the erronious Doctrine of the Scribes and Pharisees. For if Christ had not intended absolutely to forbid all manner of Swearing; Then he by that Command, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> had made the case of Swearing more doubtful and questionable than it was before; which to affirm, were a great injury to Christ, the Wisdom of God, whom God sent into the World, to give sight to the blind, and to guide their feet into the way of peace. Again, Christ Jesus being the Mediator of the new Covenant, which perfecteth for ever those that are sanctified, (which being given upon better promises than the first Covenant which made nothing perfect) was unchangable. It was therefore according to right reason, That the first Covenant, with all those things under it, that were changable and so might be shaken (as being things that were not in the beginning with God, as an Oath and Swearing was not in the beginning with God, neither originally of him, and therefore might be shaken) should be abolished and taken out of the way; To the end, that nothing that was changable, or in which there was a remembrance again of sin, might remain in the new Covenant which is unchangable. And so when that which was perfect was come; then that which was in part was abolished, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10. For Christ being come, the true and faithful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the first and the last, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. he restored, or the true witness-bearing was restored in him, to all that believe, which is perfect; which being so, it was according to right reason, that an Oath and Swearing, which was but in part, should be done away; fo<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> true witness-bearing, though without an Oath, never did preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to any, as Oaths and Swearing have done, when the witness born before or after, hath been false, as daily experience doth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie. And what if some now, as heretofore, believe not the Command of Christ, shall their unbelief make the Faith of God of none effect? God forbid. For seeing that true saying is asmuch or more than swearing; and that Christ hath said, <hi>That for every idle word men shall give an account in the day of Iudgment:</hi> And <hi>that the Lyar, as well as the false Swearer, shall he shut out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God:</hi> Therefore every one that feareth the Lord (for thereafter as a man feareth, is Gods displeasure) is as much bound
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40229:20"/>

And it may be believed, That one reason why strife doth so much in these dayes abound amongst men (notwithstanding that Oaths and Swearing abound) is, because that the true witness-bearing, as it was before swearing was, is not received in Judicial proceedings for want of an Oath and Swearing. Again, To say That Christ did forbid all Swearing, because his Father would have it so; is a better reason than any <hi>A. S.</hi> hath produced to the contrary. But to proceed to <hi>A.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The question in dispute is not, Whether Christ the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the new Covenant, did give any new Moral Command; But, Whether he forbad all Swearing to his Disciples? which that he did, his own words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34. <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> do prove. As for the word <hi>Moral,</hi> it is a word of Art, invented by the wisdom which is from below, which is not subject to the Law of God: For it's evident, That the Penmen of the Scriptures, did never make use of that word <hi>Moral,</hi> when they writ and declared the Testimony of God. And therefore the Apostles Caveat in such things is useful, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Beware lest any man spoil you through Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy and vain deceit, after the traditions of man, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.</hi> For the Law of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in Christ Jesus is Spiritual and Eternal (not Moral) and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Promise of God, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands thereof are by the Lord according to his Promise, put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mind, and written in the heart of man; <hi>written not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the Living God; not in tables of stone,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40229:21"/>
but in fleshy tables of the heart,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.3. And therefore is called, <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Iesus,</hi> Rom. 8.2. and <hi>the Law of Faith,</hi> Rom. 3.27. (and not Moral) by way of excellency above the Law of the letter, as the Scriptures do declare, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. And Christ said unto his Disciples, <hi>If ye love me, keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> Joh. 14.15. And when he commanded them to <hi>go and teach all Nations, &amp;c.</hi> They were to <hi>teach them to observe</hi> (not the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>) but <hi>all things whatsoever</hi> he had <hi>Commanded them, Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. And in <hi>Iob.</hi> 14.26. He told them, The <hi>Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father would send in his Name, he should teach them all things, and bring all things to their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, whatsoever he had said unto them.</hi> And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.12, 13. Christ told them, <hi>He had yet many things to say unto them, but they could not then bear them: Howbeit, when the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth, &amp;c.</hi> So that Christ did not send them to the Law called Moral (for to be their guide) written in tables of stone; but promised <hi>to send the Spirit of Truth to guide them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Truth, and to shew them things to come.</hi> So that although Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians do, and are to practise and observe many of those things which were commanded in the Law, as being originally of God, of which the Law had a shadow, but not the substance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. yet they do not observe them, because they find them to have been Commanded in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> but as they are Commands of Christ in the new Covenant, written in the heart, and put into the mind by the Spirit of the Lord, that quickneth and giveth Life and power to do thereafter, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. For <hi>now the Righteousness of God without the Law is manifested, being witnessed both by the Law and the Prophets; Even the Righteousness of God, which is by the Faith of Iesus Christ, unto all and upon all that believe, Rom.</hi> 3.21, 22. But the Law is not of Faith, neither ever was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Oath or Swearing of the Law of Faith, as true witness-bearing was and is: So that by the works of the Law which is not of Faith, no man is or can be Justified; but by Faith without the deeds of the Law, a man is Justified according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28 &amp; 3.20. And now those things which were commanded in the Law, which were Eternal, as the Love of God, &amp;c. was Eternal (not Moral) of which the Law engraven in stone had a shadow, although they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40229:21"/>
continue under the Gospel; yet as was said, They are not the works of the Law which made nothing perfect; but the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23. and therefore are perfect; as Love, Joy, Peace, long-Suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness, Temperance; against such there is no Law: But against Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is a Law, as before is proved. So that which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to the Law, in regard of the weakness of the flesh to do, God sending his Son for sin, condemned sin in the flesh, <hi>That the Righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the Flesh but after the Spirit, the law and power of an endless life.</hi> For, as before is said, Swearing was never any part of the Law E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal or of Faith, therefore the taking of it away was no addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to, or substraction from the Law Eternal, or of Faith. And although the Lord had limitted <hi>Moses,</hi> and in him all others from adding unto, and taking from what was then written in the Law; yet he had not limited himself to what he had then given in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to <hi>Israel</hi> (not to the Gentiles) and but for a time, <hi>until the Seed should come,</hi> Gal. 3.19. and so was temporary. And it being acknowledged by <hi>A.S.</hi> that Oaths are no Gospel Ordinance; and before proved that Christ did abolish, abrogate, disannul, and take away the Law; yea, that Law which <hi>A.S.</hi> calls Moral, in which, <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

That they should abstain from meats offered to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and from blood, from things strangled, and from Fornication.</hi> But I proceed to <hi>A.

For the Law of God, and of Christ, being perfect; therefore nothing ought to be added to it. Therefore to admit of any Exposition of the Scripture, whereby to make them contradictory one to another, or any Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture contradictory in it self, were a great evil: And therefore all commodious Interpretations (as they are called) of that Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34. <hi>But I say unto you, Swear not at all; &amp;c.</hi> inducing the lawfulness of Swearing in some cases, is denied, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to what is written: For if such Expositions were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for Truths, Then would an able Oratour with his School-Distinctions, and Syllogisms, make the same thing seem either likely, or unlikely, according to his fancy.

Scriptures following well considered, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.34, 36. &amp; 8.43. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. to which many others might be added: And yet my belief is, That the Lord in no Age hath left himself without witness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the truth and extent of the Command of Christ aforesaid, although born by Babes and poor Fishermen, or other persons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned in the many languages; and therefore little esteemed of the world (though highly esteemed of God) but by the world ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and their testimony rejected as erronious: And yet greater was he that was in them, than he that was in the World, and so they had the greater witness: for if the witness of men be great, the witness of God is greater, which every one that believeth hath in himself, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.9, 10.
