         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>
               <hi>THE EPISTLE TO THE</hi> Proteſtant Reader,</head>
            <p>THE following Papers were, for the moſt part of them, writ two Years ſince, and had then been offered to your view, if they had not been obſtructed by ſome Perſons, and for ſome Conſiderations, of no uſe to be here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
            <p>The Author conceived at that time, there was occaſion to ſuſpect, that many who pretended to be <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> cloſed with that Profeſſion out of Intereſt, or ſomething a-kin to that, rather than from Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Conſcience. Many appeared ignorant of the occaſion of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Name, and to underſtand no better what was <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantiſm</hi> it ſelf. Theſe ſeemed to be ſo wavering and uneaſie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their preſent Circumſtances, that little leſs was neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile them to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, than to be certainly ſecured from the terrible effects of Humane Statutes, provided to deter Men from ſuch Reconciliation.</p>
            <p>This prompted the Author (having ſome undeſired vacation at that time, from his uſual Imploy) to endeavour to contribute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards the helping of ſuch, who were thus unſteady, to diſcern what it was they were about to relinquiſh; and conſequently, enquire what it is, on the other ſide, they muſt eſpouſe. People, in matters of Religion, ought to be conſiderate and wary; they ſhould not deal
<pb facs="tcp:51123:3"/>
with Religion as they do with their Hats and Cloaths, when out of the faſhion. He thinks that Gibbets aad Confiſcations, and ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, are no Goſpel Appointments to befriend the True Faith. Yea, he is of opinion, that the Ambition and Sloth of Church-Officers, did firſt introduce Penal Laws, to defend and guard Chriſtianity, and force People into a Profeſſion of the Truth. And that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity made greater numbers of real Proſelites, during <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>'s general Toleration, than were made by the Penal Laws under that Emperour's Government, or by all the Penal Laws that ever were made ſince that time. He thinks that Penal Laws have not wholly rendred Chriſtianity ineffectual; but how much they have impeded its progreſs, he thinks, is very hard to comprehend. They have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly very much promoted Hypocriſy and Formality.</p>
            <p>The Author is indeed a Conformiſt, but one that was grieved at the indiſcreet, and leſs charitable cenſures and carriages of many who boaſted of the ſame character. He was really troubled to ſee them, who ſaid they were <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> behave themſelves ſo unbeſeemingly towards their fellow <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and ſo induſtriouſly weaken and undermine that very Church they made ſuch a clamour about. He does not impute what they did, intirely to ſpleen and malice againſt the Church they pretended to. As for many of them, he apprehends their Intellectuals were ſo impotent, they had few thoughts of their own, by which to govern themſelves, but were wholly under a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign conduct, which yet they perceived not. How many more were influenced by motions too mean and carnal for any good Man volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily to reſign himſelf unto? For the firſt ſort, we may pray, as our Saviour did for his Crucifiers, <hi>Lord, forgive them, for they knew not what they did.</hi> But as for the other ſort, he leaves others to conſider what meaſure of Charity belongs to them, who furiouſly ruine their Religious Neighbours, and pull down the Church they ſeem to own, meerly to ſatisfie their own filthy and moſt deteſtable Luſts. He manifeſted ſome reſentment, that <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> ſhould be treated with ſo much harſhneſs, by thoſe who pretended to the ſame Religion. Which occaſioned his having ſome experience, not only of the reproachful language, but the ruder effects of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided vehemence of ſome of his own Communion. But theſe things he overlooks, and hopes that others, whoſe treatment hath not been very obliging, will ſo forget what is paſt, as not to inſiſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the prejudice und dammage of the Religion in common amongſt us.</p>
            <p>The Prefacer concurring in all theſe matters with the Author
<pb facs="tcp:51123:3"/>
thinks he may, with greater confidence, apply to all ſorts of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> in intreating and beſeeching them, that they will not do any thing now againſt, but for the Truth. And more particularly, I would deſire,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe who are indifferent and wavering, to conſider, and think ſeriouſly before they change. Some, it may be, would make no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to depart from the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Profeſſion, were it not they were awed with the dread and terrour of ſome future danger in this World, that may poſſibly overtake them, ſhould they, under preſent Circumſtances, reſign up themſelves to a Profeſſion our Laws have made Criminal. But true Religion is a matter quite diſtinct from Humane Laws: it is of moſt neceſſary and important concern to Men's Souls, and their Eternal Salvation. And Humane Laws, whether for, or againſt it, do not alter the Caſe. And therefore both as Chriſtians and as Men, you ought to conſider and weigh things. Where different Religions are propos'd, you muſt examine the Particulars on each ſide, by the Only Rule of Religion, and muſt govern your ſelves by Evidence. The nature and importance of Religion, and the unvaluable worth of your own Souls, require this. There is nothing ſo fooliſh and abſurd, as to be of a Religion you do not underſtand, or to change your Profeſſion, you know not why, nor wherefore. Would you alter, to obtain Preferments and Honours? Alas, how littlt reaſon have you to expect theſe things, whil'ſt there are others of more deſert, and who bring better Teſtimonials with them than you can? For he that changes inconſiderately, gives no proof, either of his Parts, or of his Integrity. Do you hope, by altering your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to eſcape Troubles and Sufferings? This is an ill courſe to be taken for ſuch a purpoſe, and not likely to ſucceed, becauſe God can find you out, and has ways enough to puniſh you. Beſides, you are aſſured you ſhall not be forced to relinquiſh the Profeſſion or Exerciſe of your Religion, by a Royal Promiſe. A Promiſe, which fully performed, will attract greater repute and glory to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, than all the Arguments and Devices, the moſt learned and ſubtil Adherers to that See, did ever invent. So that you have nothing, under which you may ſhelter your Apoſtacy, nothing to patronize your Revolt. And to Apoſtatiſe without a Temptation, is at once both a Folly and Wickedneſs, that nothing can match on either account.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe, who pretending to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> have by an extravigant fervency, and unneighbourly earneſtneſs, done all
<pb facs="tcp:51123:4"/>
that was in their power to impoveriſh, macerate, and render their follow <hi>Proteſtants</hi> uneaſie and comfortleſs: Theſe I would intreat to think with ſedateneſs on what they have done, how much they have injured the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt, and what a ſtroke they have laid the Communion to which they pretended, open unto? 'Tis high time you to betake your ſelves to a deep Humiliation, godly Sorrow, and ſound Repentance for what you have done; yea, to take care you manifeſt your Humiliation and Repentance in ſo ſolemn and publick a manner, as may bear ſome proportion to the Notoriety of your fault. What inexcuſable wrong have you done to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Cauſe? What a dreadful blow have you given the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> Have you not made it thus to totter? Have you not laid it almoſt irrecoverably proſtrate? What wounds like thoſe which were made by pretended Friends! Go not about to contrive excuſes, to palliate the miſchief you have done, no verbal Apology can make amends for your Crime. Repent and weep, and pray and reform, and this ſpeedily, thorowly aggrevate your guilt, take ſhame to your ſelves publickly, and by hearty Repentance, and thorow Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, haſten to put a ſtop to thoſe Inundations of Judgments you have made way for; this is the leaſt you ought to do. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> in proſecuting the Old <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi> and the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in perſecuting <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> have this excuſe above you, that they never perſecuted for things which they themſelves acknowledged to be meerly indifferent. As you have not been afraid to commit theſe evil things againſt your Fellow <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> with a high hand, and in the ſight of the Sun; ſo be not now aſhamed to make your Repentance as open and viſible: neither be averſe, by reſtitution to the utmoſt of your power, to make ſatisfaction for all your unjuſt and mercileſs exactions. What have you wrung and ſqueez'd from others in an violent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary way? How many have you impoveriſh't, and reduc't to utmoſt extremities; and this for things, which at the ſame time you could not but acknowlede, were not worth one hair of any Man's Head? Suffer not the Wages of unrighteonſneſs to remain in any of your Hands, or in any of your Houſes; but by faithful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, do the beſt you can to ſecure your ſelves from the dreadful Recompences ſuch Wickedneſſes do expoſe you unto. If you make not the beſt ſatisfaction you are able, to thoſe you have wronged, what can you expect, but that God will remember your doings againſt you, and that you ſhall periſh for ever like your
<pb facs="tcp:51123:4"/>
own dung? <hi>He hath ſwallowed down Riches, and he ſhall vomit them up again, God ſhall caſt them out of his Belly.</hi> Job. <hi>20. 15.</hi> Have you not juſt reaſon to be afraid, leaſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vengeance ſhould overtake you on the ſudden; and that God ſhould make the Land ſpew out ſuch Inhabitants? <hi>Wherefore let my Counſel be acceptable unto you, and break off your Sins by Righteouſneſs, and your Iniquities, by ſhewing Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the Poor, if it may be a lengthening of your Tranquility,</hi> Dan. 4. 27.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe who diſſent from the <hi>Church of England:</hi> Theſe I would deſire to take care, they do not reſent their former unkind Treatment with any exorbitances, nor ſuffer the remembrance thereof to alienate them from their <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Brethren of the other Communion. Do not indulge to your Paſſions, nor keep at any greater diſtance than needs you muſt. Be not hurried into any unadviſed compliances, on the one Hand; or ſtifneſs on the other. Permit not wrath or revenge to have any place in you, much leſs, to tranſport you into any unchriſtian indecencies. Fall not your ſelves into what you have perceived to have no comlineſs in the <hi>Conformiſt</hi> Party. Fall not out one with another: improve the Eaſe, Freedom, and Liberty you injoy, for the real Intereſt of Religion. Be not concerned to make Parties; neither be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm for Notions or Practices which have no plain and expreſs warrant in Scripture.</p>
            <p>Let us all unite, and be brotherly affectioned one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Let us lay aſide and caſt from us, with utmoſt diſlike, all our Animoſities, carnal Intereſts, and unjuſt Prejudices on every hand. Let us wholly mind the things of Chriſt, and bear on anothers burthens; leave all Indifferencies juſt as Chriſt hath left them; make the Scriptures our only Rule, and lay no more ſtreſs on any particulars, than Chriſt himſelf hath laid on them. Let us all pray earneſtly, improve diligently, both the Inſtructions of the Holy Scriptures, and the preſent Calls of Providence. Let us all humble our ſelves duly under the Mighty Hand of God; ſearch into, and try our Hearts and our Ways, and turn to the Lord from all our evil doings, with our whole might. Let us all be of one mind, ſtriving together for the Faith of the Goſpel; and let us follow after Peace with
<pb facs="tcp:51123:5"/>
all Men, and Holineſs; without which none muſt ſee the Lord. Then will the Lord return and be gracious: <hi>And the Ranſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord ſhall return, and come to</hi> Zion <hi>with Songs, and everlaſting Joy upon their Heads. They ſhall obtain Joy and Gladneſs, and Sorrow and Sighing ſhall flee away.</hi> Iſal. 35. 10.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51123:6"/>
and Practice; though we ſhould allow, that in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, particular Writers have exceeded, and not kept within ſuch moderate bounds as they would have done, had they followed the examples of our moſt Learned and Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Authors; who beyond contradiction, have proved more againſt their Adverſaries than we do ordinarily expreſly charge them with; yet upon ſuppoſition that ſome of our Writers have been faulty this way, they are not the only Perſons guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and of all people in the world, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have the leaſt reaſon to inſiſt on a charge of this nature; for though their fault doth not excuſe any of our Writers, if guilty in the ſame manner, yet it renders them very unmeet to upbraid and reproach, and make tragical complaints againſt others, for what they are more enormiouſly faulty in themſelves.</p>
            <p>It is but too obvious, that ſome pains have been taken of late, to miſrepreſent the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> all over, and to perſwade the world into a belief of very odd and ſtrange things both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Perſons and Religion, yea, the very <hi>Name</hi> by which they are every where known.</p>
            <p>Indeed the word <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and its Riſe, have been ſo decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered and repreſented under ſuch ungrateful Characters, by perſons of one complexion and of another, that ſome (who, it might have been expected, had had more knowledge, and more wit) have been almoſt, or rather, quite aſhamed of that <hi>Name</hi> which their Anceſtors accounted an honour, and by which the Religion they pretend to, is every where known: what thoughts ſuch have of the Religion it ſelf, time may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcover. Who would ever have thought that <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> who had a long time, or rather, all their time been brought up in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and would fain have made a Figure in their Countries, ſhould yet be at a loſs by what name to call the Religion they did profeſs; certainly the common name might have paſt well enough, had not ſome unjuſt prejudice prevail'd: And it's very probable, this prejudice did take its Riſe from one or others miſrepreſenting, and giving a wrong account of that Name.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who prefeſs true and unmixt <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> have for a great while, been diſtinguiſhed in moſt parts of the World, by the name of <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> from others, who have mingled with a profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> a great many groſs contradictions and inconſiſtencies: And till now of late, none who owned
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51123:6"/>
the Religion, were aſhamed of the <hi>Name:</hi> Thoſe who liked not the <hi>Romiſh Communion,</hi> did not think it a reproach to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Though the <hi>Name</hi> might be firſt deviſed by the Adverſaries of our Religion, and might be uſed by them at firſt in ſcorn and contempt, with reference to thoſe who would not imbrace and ſubmit to all the forreign and unſcriptural No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Practices which received life and authority from <hi>Rome;</hi> yet the antient love to, and zeal for Religion, only as commanded by divine Authority, and as warranted by thoſe Books which are univerſally acknowledged by all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be writ by men divinely inſpired, reconciled our Anceſtors to that <hi>Name</hi> by which the Adverſaries of their Religion would have redicul'd them out of their Profeſſion. And how it is come to paſs, that people profeſſing the ſame Religion, ſhould now appear ſhy, and boggle at the <hi>Name,</hi> as if ſome dreadful and hideous matter were wrapt up in the word <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine, unleſs either their love to, and zeal for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, be leſs than their Anceſtor's was; or that ſome falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations have been made to them of the importance and firſt occaſion of this <hi>Name.</hi> What ſort of writers have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed moſt to create prejudices in mens minds againſt the name <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> I will not determine: but I do not lay all the fault of miſrepreſenting in this caſe, on thoſe who do openly profeſs themſelves of the <hi>Romiſh Communion;</hi> and yet I cannot wholly excuſe them, becauſe of late, they have been at no ſmall ſtudy and trouble to perſwade people to entertain very wrong Idea's both of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Name and Religion.</p>
            <p>We are lately told, that <q>The <hi>Proteſtant Perſwaſion</hi> has its Name, Being, and Support, not from what it is in it ſelf, but from what it is not, in defying and proteſting againſt their Neighbours. <bibl>

            <p>Now it may not be altogether improper, in order to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſome weaker people right in their apprehenſions, to give a ſhort and true account of the firſt occaſion and riſe of this Name <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and its general uſe ever ſince, from Authors of the beſt credit and repute on each ſide.</p>
            <p>And that this Account may be the more clear and diſtinct, it will be requiſite to obſerve in general, That a great corruption had for many Ages overſpread <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. Afterwards we may take notice, how Princes and People were more directly prepared to renounce and caſt off
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51123:7"/>
thoſe Corruptions; and then it will be proper to relate the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular matter of Fact which occaſioned this Name <hi>Proteſtant:</hi> and when theſe are diſpatched, you ſhall hear what <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> is, and wherein <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> doth really conſiſt.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is a forreign word, derived to us from other people; and it has been, and is ſtill uſed with relation to Religion, in all Nations where it is mentioned. So that every where, thoſe who have owned and profeſſed the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, have paſt currently with all ſorts of people for <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</hi> And the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion is the true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, reſcued and reformed from thoſe Corruptions and humane Additions the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> had for many Ages, without good warrant, intermixed with it.</p>
            <p>The Myſtery of Iniquity, which began in the Apoſtles days, did by degrees increaſe to that height in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that it almoſt overwhelmed true <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and made Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion appear, and be in the world little elſe than a trick of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, and a meer piece of Pageantry. And when the people had been a great while inured to nothing but lifeleſs Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Formalities, and were brought up blindly in a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, carnal, gay ſort of practice, which was called Worſhip, the Biſhops of that <hi>See</hi> did by ſeveral artifices and tricks, firſt acquire, and then improve opportunities, to gratifie their own utmoſt and unreaſonable ambition: for the Princes and People were in many places ſo effeminated, made ſo ſoft and eaſie, and unthinking by their methods, they very tamely and patiently gave way to their moſt unjuſt incroachments, till at laſt they were not able to help themſelves, nor oppoſe the increaſing greatneſs of that <hi>See.</hi> And when matters were brought to this paſs, then ſeveral points were forced on the whole <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church; the burthen of which, the Inhabitants of thoſe parts had never before felt; and which thoſe who firſt gave way to the Uſurpations of that <hi>See,</hi> never dream't of. Now an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Supremacy over the whole Church was challenged, and a power pretended, to make whatever pleas'd a Duty. In ſhort, the Biſhop of that <hi>See</hi> pretended an Infallibility, which muſt not be call'd in queſtion; he aſſum'd a power to diſpoſe of People's Sins and Souls as he thought fit, and perſwaded them he could conſecrate any thing they would buy, to be an effectual means to purge away their guilt. Nay, at laſt he claimed a power to diſpoſe of Governments, appropriating to himſelf a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51123:7"/>
Superiority in every Prince's Dominions; and both Princes and People were blinded to that degree, through the Ignorance, Superſtitions, and Impurity which they had given way to, and the juſt infatuation which God ſuffered to crawl on and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power them, that for a long time, very few, either of the Princes or People, did make any conſiderable attempts to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate themſelves out of that Bondage, or get rid of the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Apoſtacy into which they were ſunk.</p>
            <p>But the time haſtening on, when God would deliver his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of of that wretched eſtate: The Head and principal Inſtruments of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> State were grown ſo ſecure and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of danger, they gave up themſelves to their Luſts, and mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing but how to invent new ways to impoveriſh the people; by which means they occaſioned the people to awake, and ſuggeſted to their minds the moſt powerful and juſteſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt the way they were in, and that Church they did then adhere to.</p>
            <p>For though there were many beams of light which ſhone up and down in the world, yet two things did principally diſpoſe the people to caſt off that Spiritual and Civil Yoke which had mightily gall'd both their Conſciences and their Necks, and to inquire after the Truth and Purity of Religion.</p>
            <p>The firſt, was the obvious, prodigious Ignorance, Sloth, and beaſtly Senſuality and Debauchery of the generality of thoſe who pretended they had the keeping of the people's Souls and Conſciences; the Wickedneſs, Tyranny, and Unſatiableneſs of the greateſt part, by far, of the Clergy, was ſuch as ſtruck moſt violently on the outward ſenſes of the People: So that they were forced to conclude, God would not intruſt any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Depoſitum</hi> with ſuch perſons. A <hi>German</hi> Biſhop, in the year 1519 (which was not long before the <hi>Reformation,)</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains (as in <hi>Muſeccle</hi> I find him quoted) in this manner: <q>I am afraid the Doctrine of the Apoſtle, touching the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of a Biſhop, is but very ill obſerved in theſe days, or rather, that we are fallen into thoſe Times which he noted, when he ſaid, <hi>I know that after my Departure Ravenous Wolves will come among you, not ſparing the Flock.</hi> Where may one ſee a good Man choſen to be a Biſhop? One approved by his Works and his Learning: And any one, who is not either a Child, or Worldly, or ignorant in Spiritual things? They have no love for ony but Sinners, they deſpiſe the Poor,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51123:8"/>
they keep about their perſons Pimps, Debauchers of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Flatterers, Buffoons, Players, when they ſhould have wiſe and holy Men. The Revenues of the Church are given, not to the Servants of God, but to thoſe of the Devil, to Debauchers of Women, to Adulterers, Gameſters, Hunters, Flatterers, and ſuch like Men. And hence it is, that the Houſe of God is become Tributary to the Devil.</q> 
               <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> I remember, ſpeaking in his Hiſtory, of the corruption and wickedneſs of the Clergy, ſaith, <q>It was riſen to ſo infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a height, the Devil ſent them Letters of Thanks, becauſe of the extraordinary ſervice they did him, in ſending Souls to Hell in greater Troops than ever came thither before.</q> You may find large accounts of, and complaints againſt their notorious wickedneſs in the Writings of <hi>Nic. de Clemang.</hi> and others. Several of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Writers do acknowledge, their Debauchery and Wickedneſs was ſuch, as did neceſſitate the people to ſeek after a Reformation. <q>And truly (ſaith <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceray)</hi> the extream Ignorance of the Clergy, many of them ſcarce able to read; the ſcandalons Lives of the Paſtors, moſt of them Concubinaries, Drunkards, and Uſerers; and their extream negligence gave him (viz. <hi>Luther)</hi> a fair advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to perſwade the people, that the Religion they taught, was corrupt, ſince their Lives and Examples were ſo bad.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond thing which very much awaken'd the Princes and People, and prepar'd them to caſt off and renounce the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Trumpery, was the Pope's, Biſhop's, and other Eccleſiaſtical Officers moſt enormious proſtituting thoſe very things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they pretended to place very much of their Religion, and by which they pretended to impart to the people the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Saints. For <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth having a mind to raiſe great Summs of Mony to ſatisfie his own profuſe humour, and make large Proviſions for his Kindred, ſent abroad his Agents through the Empire, but eſpecially in <hi>Germany,</hi> to ſell the pardon of Sins publickly, under pretence to build the Church of St. <hi>Peters</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> The Sellers of theſe Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, did proſtitute them at the ſtrangeſt rate imaginable; for they would ſell them for any thing wherewith they might ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their Luſts. They would play them away at Taverns; at a Game at Dice, they would <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>And when this was complained of, and wrote againſt by <hi>Luther,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> ſent his <hi>Bull</hi> to confirm theſe <hi>Indulgencies,</hi> aſſerting his power to give and divulge them in this manner. By the power of the Keys given to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſors, the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> had a right to pardon the Faithful all the guilt and puniſhment of their Actual Sins; to wit, the guilt, by means of the Sacrament of <hi>Pennance;</hi> and the temporal Puniſhment by means of Indulgencies, whether in this life, or in <hi>Purgatory:</hi> and that by thoſe Indulgencies, he could apply to the Living and the Dead, the ſuperabundance of the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt and the Saints, either by way of Abſolution, or by way of Suffrage. So that the Living and the Dead participating of thoſe Indulgencies, were delivered from the puniſhment that the Divine Juſtice would inflict on them for their Actual Sins.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Luther</hi>'s contending this point with the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Agents, put him and others on a more ſtrict Inquiry into other Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in that Church: by which means Light broke forth dayly with more power, to the full ſatisfaction of very many, that there was an abſolute neceſſity of a Reformation. And the Agents being not able to conteſt the matter fairly with <hi>Luther, Eccius</hi> and others being quite worſted and baffled in their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guings, <hi>Sylveſter Prierias</hi> poſitively inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the <hi>Pope</hi>'s authority, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Sleid.

               </note> the Scriptures did not warrant thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencies, but that the <hi>Pope</hi> did, whoſe authority, he aſſerted, was above the Scriptures. And thus he brought that point on the ſtage, which upon examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, appearing to be a meer cheat and groſs untruth, the people haſtened to imbrace the Sufficiency of the Scripture, and that the Holy Scriptures were the only Rule God had appointed <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to guide themſelves by in all matters of Religion, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the <hi>Pope</hi>'s pretended authority.</p>
            <p>This, of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s authority, being the point, for which both Head and Members of that Church were mainly concerned, and which ſupports and keeps all the other corruptions in that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51123:9"/>
Church, in life, when the vanity and ungroundedneſs, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity and wickedneſs of that claim came to be expoſed and laid open to the World, the Intereſt of that Church did very mueh ſink, and the authority of Scripture was much advanced amongſt people. So that the <hi>Pope,</hi> notwithſtanding all his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Stratagems to deſtroy <hi>Luther,</hi> and hinder the ſpreading of that Light which was now broken forth, could not effect his deſign; but knowledge increaſed every day, and the authority of the Scripture was much inſiſted on, to the great damage of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Adherents.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the <hi>Pope</hi> by his Letters and Nuncio's, did prevail with the Emperour, and ſome of the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> to make an Edict, <note place="margin">Mounſ. Clauddef <hi>of the Reformation,</hi> part <hi>3d.</hi>
               </note> when they were aſſembled at <hi>Worms,</hi> which forbad <hi>Luther</hi> Fire and Water, and the commerce of all the World; it extended alſo to all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers and Followers, and Complices: but the more violent the <hi>Pope</hi> and and his people were againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> and the greater ſtir they kept with the Princes to ſee the Edict of <hi>Worms</hi> ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed, the greater number of Friends God raiſed up for <hi>Luther</hi> and his Followers.</p>
            <p>For the Princes aſſembled at <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> declared they could not put the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Bull, nor the Edict of <hi>Worms</hi> in execution, without involving themſelves in great dangers, and that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the people were ſo ſenſible how matters ſtood, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their eyes opened by the writings of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that if they ſhould execute thoſe Sentences, the people would believe they were only made to overthrow the Truth of the Goſpel, and to maintain and defend their evil abuſes and impieties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And having drawn up this their Anſwer in form of an Edict, they ſent their grievances to the <hi>Pope,</hi> to the number of an hundred Articles, which they call'd, <hi>Centum Gravamina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, another Aſſembly of the Princes publiſh'd another declaration in form of an Imperial Edict, which extreamly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok't the <hi>Pope</hi> and all his Creatures. Upon this the <hi>Pope</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the Emperour by Letters; and to animate him the more, he perſwaded him that that was a manifeſt breach of his Authority, and a form and deſign to withdraw themſelves intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from his Obedience: the Emperour is hereby prevailed with to concern himſelf in the matter; and accordingly, writes very preremptorily to the Princes, requiring them to execute the Edict

His Account is thus.</p>
            <q>
               <p>In the Month of <hi>April,</hi> in the Year 1529, an Aſſembly of the Princes and other States of <hi>Germany</hi> was held at <hi>Spire;</hi> whether Pope <hi>Clement</hi> did not ſail to ſend a Nuncio: the firſt thing they did there, <note place="margin">M. Clauddeſ. <hi>of the Reform.</hi> part <hi>3d.</hi> pag, 51. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> was to reject the Aſſembly at the City of <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> under pretence that it had aboliſhed the uſe of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> without waiting for the Imperial Diet. This violent procedure was quickly after followed by a Decree, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and ſome other Princes who took part with the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> made, and whom the Emperour had expreſly chozen for his Deputy Commiſſioners. They ordained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the firſt place, that thoſe who till then had obſerved the Edict of <hi>Worms,</hi> that is to ſay, who not only had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Reformation, but who had perſecuted it with all their might, ſhould for the future do the like, and force their Subjects to do the ſame: And that as for thoſe, in whoſe Countries thoſe new Doctrines had been ſpread abroad, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they could not extirpate them, without putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into manifeſt danger of ſtirring up Troubles, it ſhould be their part, at leaſt, to hinder any thing more from being Innovated, till the calling of a Council. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They ordained, that above all things, the Doctrine which oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Subſtantial Preſence,</hi> ſhould neither be propounded nor received by any in all the compaſs of <hi>Germany,</hi> and that the <hi>Maſs</hi> ſhould not be abrogated. In the <hi>Third</hi> place, they decreed, that they ſhould not allow Preachers in any place to explain the Goſpel otherwiſe than by the Interpretation of the <hi>Fathers.</hi> In fine, they ordained grievous penalties againſt the <hi>Printers</hi> and <hi>Booksellers</hi> who ſhould print or vend, for the future, the Books that contained that new Doctrine.</p>
               <p>The other Princes and States of the Empire beholding this manifeſt Oppreſſion, thought themſelves bound to make an Act of <hi>Proteſtation</hi> to the contrary: They Remonſtrated
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51123:10"/>
therefore, that that new Decree contradicted that which had been paſſed in the preceding Aſſembly, where every one was to be free in reſpect of his Religion; that they did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to hinder the other Princes and States from enjoying that Liberty; but that on the contrary, they pray'd God that He would give them the knowledge of His Truth: That they could not, with a good Conſcience, approve of the Reaſon, for which they would allow them to retain the Evangelical Doctrine, to wit, leaſt they ſhould fall into new Troubles; for that would be to confeſs, that it would be good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that Doctrine, if it could be done without Tumult; which would be a criminal and wicked Confeſſion, and a tacit Denyal of the Word of God. That as to the <hi>Maſs,</hi> thoſe who had aboliſh't it, and who had re-eſtabliſhed in its place the lawful uſe of the <hi>Supper</hi> of our Lord, were led by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. That as for the Doctrine that oppoſed the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> they did not believe, that they ought lightly to condemn thoſe who held it, without hearing them; and that proceeding was againſt Equity, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a matter of ſo great conſequence. In fine, that they could not conſent to that Decree, offering the Reaſons of their carriage to the Emperour and all the World. That they did appeal to a Free Council, and that in waiting for it, they would do nothing for which they ſhould juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any blame.—This <hi>Act of Proteſtation</hi> was made at <hi>Spire,</hi> the <hi>19th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1529.

Eccleſ.</note> and proteſted againſt the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, and for the Sufficiency and ſole Authority of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>And this Name hath ever ſince been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to, and appropriated by them who have renounced Popiſh Corruptions, and eſpecially, that great
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51123:10"/>
Fundamental Article of the Supremacy, becauſe of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to, and derogating from the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>The beſt Hiſtorians, both <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and <hi>Popiſh,</hi> do confirm the Truth of this Relation; and that all people have promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly paſt in all Countries under the Name of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who have renounced the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Authority, and that Body or Syſtem of falſe Doctrines and ſuperſtitious Practices, which are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and juſtified in the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> becauſe of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction unto Scripture.</p>
            <p>For the Name <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is a common Title to diſcriminate all thoſe who renounce and forſake the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion, becauſe of its contradiction to the Holy Scripture, from thoſe who do own, and are of that Communion. But it was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to deſcriminate one ſort of people renouncing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting againſt that Communion on the aforeſaid Account, from others who agree in the ſame Point. And therefore in every Age and Nation, other Names have been made uſe of to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriminate <hi>Proteſtants</hi> one from another, according to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in difference betwixt them.</p>
            <p>True <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> then conſiſteth more eſpecially in two Points.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Proteſting againſt, and renouncing <hi>Popiſh</hi> Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and eſpecially all ſuch Infallibility, Supremacy, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have, for ſome Ages, laid a claim to. It is the renouncing the thing it ſelf, which <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> chiefly reſpects; its reference to ſuch a particular perſon, is only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental, by reaſon of his audacious and arrogant challenging that Power. But <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> would be equally againſt the Claim, if that Biſhop ſhould lay it down, and any other, either in <hi>France,</hi> or in any other Countrey, ſhould challenge it; or if it ſhould be pretended to be lodged in any other Man, or Body of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Proteſting for the Sufficiency and Authority of the Scripture: That the Holy Scripture is a ſafe and full Rule for the Inſtruction of us in all things needful to be known or done in order to Eternal Life; and that nothing ought to be admitted as an Article of Chriſtian Faith; which cannot, by juſt conſequence, be proved by this Rule, according as the <hi>Church of England</hi> expreſſeth her ſelf. <hi>Article</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>In theſe two things <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> doth conſiſt; the denial and renouncing of the <hi>Pope's</hi> arrogated Supremacy, and all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51123:11"/>
thoſe Superſtructions which have no foundation but that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and the owning and adhering to the Scriptures, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compleat Rule of Religion: This is the great, fundamental, poſitive Principle in <hi>Proteſtantiſm.</hi> For <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> doth not take away an andue, boundleſs Power and Authority from the <hi>Pope,</hi> and conſer it on another perſon. It aſcribes indeed to the Supream Power in every Nation, what belongs to the ſame, according to the conſtitution of the Government; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting againſt all forreign and every unjuſt pretence and claim, to the prejudice of the rightful Owner. And it aſſerts the only right of the Scripture to be the Rule that every Supream Power on Earth ſhould obſerve in reſtoring and reforming Religion, as occaſions are offered, by reaſon of the Decays or Corruptions which may have prevailed.</p>
            <q>The Bible, I ſay, the Bible only is the Religion of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> whatſoever elſe <note place="margin">Chilling worth<hi>'s Safe way to Salvation.</hi> pag. 375.</note> they Believe beſides it, and the plain ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable, indubitable Conſequences of it; well may they hold it as a matter of Opinion; but as matter of Faith and Religion, neither can they, with coherence to their own grounds, Believe it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor require the Belief of it of others, without moſt high and Schiſmatical Preſumption.</q>
            <p>And now, ſeeing <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> doth mainly, or rather, only conſiſt in aſſerting the Holy Scriptures to be the Rule, the only Rule, by which all Chriſtians are to govern and manage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in all matters of Religion. So that no Doctrine is to be owned as an Article of Faith, on any account, but what hath very plain warant and ſound evidence from the Scriptures; nor no inſtance of Religious Worſhip to be owned or ſubmitted to, as neceſſary; nor any thing to be entertained as a part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but what the Scripture doth appoint and warrant. It may not be altogether unuſeful, to inquire briefly, whether this Principle be really juſtifiable, or no? Or, whether thoſe who are called <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> on this Account, be truly in the right, touching this matter? For, if we be right in this Point, then the great Fundamental oppoſite Point of our Adverſaries muſt needs have a ſlaw in it, and cannot be ſolid and ſubſtantial; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, all the particular Doctrines and Practices, which have their whole being and Dependance on that Authority, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily expire, and give up the Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:51123:11"/>
Now much might be offered to evince, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have very good ground to reſt aſſured, that they are not miſtaken in this matter: but I will only offer theſe few conſiderations; which being well conſidered and improved, may ſuffice to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any unprejudiced and imp<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tial honeſt meaning perſon, that <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> is not a <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>merſome precarious thing, but is really accompanied with the greateſt evidence and certainty any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion can juſtly pretend unto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is univerſally acknowledged, by all who profeſs themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that the Holy Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe Books contained in the Old and New Teſtament, as received by <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> are the Word of God, and were written at the appointment of God, for the conſtant Uſe and Benefit of his Church and People, by Perſons Divinely Inſpired for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppoſing (but not granting) that thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do not contain the whole Revelation God hath made of his Mind and Will, for the conſtant, perpetual, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Uſe of his Church; yet it is moſt evident, that theſe Scriptures are a ſafe and moſt certain Rule in Matters of Religion, ſo far as they do extend. They are a certain Rule touching thoſe matters of which they do treat, and ſo far as they do treat of them.</p>
            <p>So that there can be no juſt pretence of a Divine Revelation for any Doctrines or Practices which are inconſiſtent with, or contradictory to what God hath declared in theſe Scriptures: Becauſe the Divine Veracity and Truth, which is Eſſential to the Deity, cannot permit, that God ſhould contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. All that can be pretended, with reference to this matter, is, that God may make more Declarations of his Will; and either inlarge the Diſcoveries He hath made of his Will touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars already made known; or add Declarations of His Mind concerning Matters which He doth not at all diſcourſe of in the Scriptures. But it is not conſiſtent with the Natural Notions of a Deity, not with the Revelations God hath made any way of Himſelf, that He ſhould overthrow the Truth of a Former Revelation by a Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or that Contradictions ſhould be reconcileable in His Will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:51123:12"/>
For any Man to affirm that a Divine Revelation may contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict any thing taught in the Scriptures, whil'ſt he profeſſeth theſe Scriptures are pure Divine Revelations, is not only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve himſelf in moſt obvious and horrid Abſurdities, but to contract upon himſelf, to burthen and overwhelm himſelf with the guilt of the moſt plain and unnatural Blaſphemy againſt God. If any thing that plainly contradicts the Scripture, can be a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, then a Man may be indiſpenſibly obliged to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and not to Believe the ſame thing; to do, and not to do the ſame work. And ſo Man will be brought under ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that whether he Believe, or do not Believe; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he Practice, or do not Practice, it will be the ſame thing, he will be equally guilty. But certainly, if our Adverſaries can pretend to Revelations which do contradict the Scriptures, they cannot pretend to lay any Obligation on us to comply with them in thoſe Matters which the Scriptures do contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict; for we have every jot as good Authority to Believe and Practice in direct contradiction to them, as they have to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and Act in expreſs contradiction to us, though we ſhould condeſcend to an impoſſible Suppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Divine Revelation may contradict the Scriptures. Beſides, they have no need or occaſion to trouble themſelves to prevail with us to comply with them in their Points; for (ſuppoſing their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to be as they prerend) whether we comply, or do not comply, the Caſe is juſt the ſame; for we are never the better if we do comply with them; nor is our guilt and offence one jot the more, if we do not comply. But if what they call Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelations, be not really ſo; and they will, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Believe or Act, or both, in contradiction to the Scriptures, which are known, owned, and profeſſed Divine Revelations; let them ſeriouſly conſider what is like to be the fruit of their ſo doing. We have reaſon therefore to conclude, that all thoſe Doctrines and Practices which are inconſiſtent with, and do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict what is declared in the Holy Scripture, have not a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Original, but have their Riſe from the fountain of Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Untruth: And therefore we cannot be juſtly blamed, if we proteſt againſt and reject ſuch Notions and Practices; for we certainly have a good Foundation and juſt Authority for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of our Religion, which Scripture doth expreſly and plainly warrant. And they muſt needs be at a great loſs for juſt Authority, as to thoſe Points which expreſly contradict the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51123:12"/>
Scripture, whatever may become of thoſe Points amongſt them, touching which, they may conceive the Scripture is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
            <p>But laſtly, If the Holy Scriptures we are ſpeaking of, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the whole and intire Revelation of the Mind and Will of God, which he hath deſigned for the conſtant and perpetual uſe of his Church and People, and do furniſh People with full In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and Directions in all Matters of Religion, then <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> have very good warrant to affirm and ſtedfaſtly adhere to this Point, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Holy Scriptures are the only Rule we are to govern our ſelves by in all Matters of Religion. And we are ſafe enough as to this part of our main Principle; and cannot, with any juſtice, be reproached or blamed by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries on this Account, till they can produce very good and ſubſtantial evidence for ſome other Divine Revelation really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from thoſe we are diſcourſing of. But this is a task ſo hard for them to undertake, ſo impoſſible for them to perform, that there is not one underſtanding perſon in that Communion (I am perſwaded) who dares adventure to ingage in it. For it will not ſerve the turn to talk honourably of Tradition in general, nor to make a noiſe about Apoſtolical Traditions, without mentioning particular Traditions, and proving them to be Divine Revelations, and that they are truly Apoſtolical, and were by Divine Appointment ſet apart for the perpetual uſe of the Chriſtian Church. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſpeaks loud of Apoſtolical Traditions, and advances them to the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the Holy Scriptures, and appears ſo reſolv'd for theſe Traditions, that ſhe makes them neceſſary to compleat the Scripture, in order unto its being a perfect Rule: but alas, her courage cool'd in a little time, for ſhe dared only to talk extravagantly, and in exceſſive terms of Tradition in General; ſhe dared not to name particular Traditions, which ſhe would own and undertake to prove truly Apoſtolical, and of Divine and conſtantly binding Authority to the Church. And ſince ſhe thought it not convenient to deſcend to particulars, I am of opinion, particular perſons in that Communion will not care to meddle in the matter, but rather chuſe to refer it to another Council, when they can get one: becauſe, if they ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it, it muſt only be for our ſakes; and thoſe of that Communion cannot but know, that nothing leſs will ſatisfie ſuch cautious, reaſonable people as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are, in a matter
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51123:13"/>
of this nature, than ſuch evidence, as is very ſubſtantial and proportionate to the thing to be proved. And could they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ever ſo good evidence for any particular they will call a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, or Apoſtolical Tradition, it would be of no uſe to thoſe of their own Church, who prefer particular Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Teſtimony, called by another Name, before all ſort of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and ſuitable evidence. And after all their pains, though they could produce ſatisfactory evidence (which I affirm to be utterly impoſſible in this caſe) for ſome Tradition which would inforce ſome Point the Scriptures do not inforce yet this would not do them any ſervice, however it would weaken our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, as touching the Perfect on of that Body of Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have: For notwithſtanding, we ſhould, in obedience to a Divine Revelation, though roughly proved and evidenced, concur and joyn with them in ſome Point we did not imbrace before; yet the difference betwixt them and us in that matter, would be as great as before; there would ſtill remain a formal difference betwixt us touching this very particular; becauſe, though we ſhould Believe or Practice the ſame thing, yet the formal Reaſon of Believing or Doing it, would be totally diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
            <p>So that if any would attempt to produce ſubſtantial evidence for any Revelation diſtinct from the Scriptures, their labour will be wholly uſeleſs, with reference to their Church, unleſs they can produce a Revelation relating to their Church, like that Law the flattering Courtiers of an <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Prince told him they could find, when they were at a loſs for a particular Law, to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſome particular Practice the Prince was inclined unto; though they knew of no Law relating to what was propos'd, yet there was a Law, that the Prince might Command and do what he pleaſed. Such a Revelation our Adverſaries muſt produce, (Indeed, I am apprehenſive, they Act in that Communion, as if they had ſuch a Revelation; but all the miſchief is, they cannot produce valid proof for it) or elſe they muſt be at the trouble of providing diſtinct Revelations for the ſeveral Points in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, and diſtinct Evidence, unleſs they can make a ſhift to croud three or four of their Notions into a ſingle Tradition, and ſo make ſhorter work of it.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do affirm, That Divine Revelation is the only Rule of Chriſtian Religion: That the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are confeſſedly Divine Revelations: That theſe Holy
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51123:13"/>
Scriptures do contain all thoſe Divine Revelations God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be of perpetual ſtanding, obliging Uſe to his Church and People. We acknowledge, that were it poſſible for our Adverſaries to produce ſolid proof, that there is any Divine Revelation diſtinct from what theſe Holy Scriptures do contain, which God hath appointed to be of conſtant, perpetual, binding Uſe to his Church, they might thereby invalidate our Principle, which doth affirm, that the Holy Scriptures are the Only Rule by which Chriſtians are to govern themſelves in all Matters of Religion: But yet we affirm, their doing this, would not really advantage their Cauſe; becauſe the ſame Formal difference would remain betwixt them and us after, as before; for though we ſhould be obliged, on their exhibiting ſuch proof for ſome particular Revelation, which ſhould warrant and oblige to own and uſe ſome Doctrine or Practice at preſent in diſpute betwixt us; yet the agreement which would then ſeem to be betwixt them and us, in that particular, would only be material, and not formal; becauſe we ſhould then own the Doctrine or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, what is injoyned, purely becauſe taught and commanded by a Divine Revelation, throughly evidenced: And they would own the Doctrine or Practice, the Duty injoyned, purely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe taught and commanded by a meer Humane Authority, which they are pleaſed to name Infallible. And it will not be to any purpoſe, for them to undertake a more quick diſpatch in this matter, by talking of an Infallible Judge, for he cannot be Judge and Rule too: There muſt be Divine Revelation, which muſt be the Rule for their Infallible Judge to exerciſe and imploy his Infallible Judgment about. And ſeeing all their attempts to prove their Infallible Judge by Scripture, have been very unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and without ſucceſs. I may take it for granted, when once they have agreed together, and found out their Infallible Judge, their beſt proof that that Perſon, or Body of Men (which ever they ſhall agree upon) is a Judge, and an Infallible Judge in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, muſt be ſome new Revelation, or ſome old Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition never hitherto known to be a Divine Revelation; for we muſt have better proof than any that has yet been offered on the behalf of any of their Traditions, before we can entertain them as Divine Revelations. And when they have well proved that Tradition, and its Divine Authority, which ſhall fix and ſettle their Infallible Judge, they muſt ſtill be at the trouble and pains to produce very ſubſtantial proof for every other Tradition they will make a part of the Chriſtian Rule.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:51123:14"/>
For the Authority of their Infallible Judge will not do here, becauſe his Infallibility does not reach to make, nor declare a Rule, but is purely concerned about the true ſenſe and meaning of an acknowledged Rule, when Controverſies do ariſe about the importance of any Expreſſions contained in that Rule.</p>
            <p>But beſides all this, <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have ſuch evidence, as doth create certain aſſurance, that the Holy Scriptures are fully Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, to inſtruct and direct Believers in all matters of Religion, and do contain all thoſe Divine Revelations God hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of neceſſary and perpetual Uſe unto his Church: greater evidence cannot be deſired, than the expreſs Witneſs, Teſtimony, and Declaration of the unerring Spirit of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and True God. And this we have moſt plainly, to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable and full Conviction of every honeſt, piouſly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ingenious, and unprejudiced Perſon, who really owns and believes the Holy Scriptures are the Word of God: And this, you heard before, is the profeſſed Belief of all who profeſs themſelves <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And if ſuch kind of evidence will not ſerve peoples turns, I muſt acknowledge, they are of a temper I do not much care to deal with; for I muſt confeſs, I am no preat admirer of booted blunderbus Apoſtles; nor do I think he makes any real Proſelites, who only dragoon's Men into a Perſwaſion: I never lik'd murthering Men for Religion; nor perſecuting Men, becauſe their Conſciences would not ſtretch to every body's phancy. I think, whil'ſt the Scriptures are acknowledged, on all ſides, to be Divine Revelations, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and beſt evidence we can have, in matters of Religion, is plain and expreſs Scripture. And if in all our Diſputes with our Adverſaries, we did ſtrictly keep within this compaſs, we ſhould guard and maintain our owe Cauſe the better, and wound our Adverſaries Cauſe the more fatally: not but that I am very ſenſible, we have Antiquity, the Fathers, rhe Primitive Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the moſt General Councils on our ſide, either expreſly, or by way of ſilence; thereby certifying us, that no ſuch Points were known, or in queſtion in thoſe days.</p>
            <p>But alas! by having ordinary recourſe to the Fathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we mightily gratifie our Adverſaries; for hereby they get out of the immediate reach of the Sword of the Spirit: And all the Teſtimonies of Antiquity taken together, in their own ſtrength, will not do rhe thouſandth part of that execution againſt a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51123:14"/>
as one plain and expreſs Scripture will. Beſides, how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do we ſee, that when the greatly Read and Learned, on both ſides, do fall together by the Ears over the Fathers, they lengthen the Diſpute beyond meaſure; and not only bewilder the Hearer or Reader, but even themſelves too; that by the time they are got half through the Diſpute, they have well night forgot what it was they began to diſpute about.</p>
            <p>And having ſlipt into this digreſſion, I may even adventure to hint one digreſſion more, relating to the common way of managing Controverſies with our Adverſaries, the <hi>Romaniſts.</hi> It may be, if it be well inquired into, it may appear, that we do not ordinarily proceed in our Controverſial Diſcourſes with them, in that free and ingenious manner we ought, but do too much limit and ſtraighten our ſelves. According to that little meaſure of apprehenſion I have, it ſeems to me moſt expedient and moſt proper for us, in oppoſing our Adverſaries, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Proteſtantiſm,</hi> or the <hi>Proteſtant Doctrines,</hi> both really and profeſſedly as ſuch; and not to pinnion our ſelves, by pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to maintain them, as Taught or Owned by particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions. The Cauſe is a common Cauſe; and the Arguments we can truly maintain it with, are common Arguments; one Party is no more intereſted in them than another; nor do the Matters in diſpute amongſt our ſelves, concern the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies betwixt us and our Common Adverſaries. Why ſhould we ſo affect and hug our ſelves in our private Notions, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Differences, as to pleaſe our ſelves with, or at leaſt, receive and keep up the unreaſonable Remembrance of them. Indeed, I do acknowledge the candor of our Adverſaries, in that they have not improved the advantage they might have taken, to have made ſome Tragical Appearances, by falling upon us, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to this very matter, of undertaking to maintain <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Doctrines, meerly as owned by a particular Party: for what doth this properly import, but that we relinquiſh the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Principle, and undertake, only to maintain our Doctrines, not by the Scripture, as the General and Only Rule of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, but by the Scripture as limited and bounded by thoſe diſcriminating Terms and Inſtances, whereby we are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from all others, who take the Scripture to be the Only Rule in all Matters of Religion. Now, will not this, if inſiſted
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51123:15"/>
on, make our task the harder, and the more confound and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex our Controverſies? But would it not ſeem odd for a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrant, or a Contra-Remonſtrant to defend <hi>Chriſtianiry,</hi> or the particular Doctrines of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> againſt <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi> purely as a Remonſtrant, or a Contra-Remonſtrant? For what have their particular differences to do in matters wherein they all agreed, and in maintaining of that, for which both ſides are equally concerned?</p>
            <p>The main of the Controverſy betwixt us and thoſe of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Communion, is either, whether the Holy Scriptures be the Only Rule in all Matters of Religion? Or, whether thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Doctrines wherein they and we do differ, have warrant from the Scriptures? And what need we, intreating on theſe points, to intereſt any diſcriminating notions amongſt our ſelves; <hi>As far as we do agree, let us walk by the ſame Rule.</hi> Beſides, by concerning our ſelves for <hi>Proteſtantiſm,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant Doctrines</hi> (even in oppoſition to our Adverſaries) in common, as fixing the Scriptures to be the Only Rule, and that our particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine have plain warrant from the Scripture, and thoſe we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, are either contrary to the Scriptures, or have no warrant at all from thence, we are excuſed from any obligation to trouble our ſelves with defending any unwary, or leſs proper expreſſions, which may have ſlipt from particular Parties, or particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in declaring their ſenſe of particular Doctrines; for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they expreſt themſelves properly, or no; or whether their opinion were right, or no, is not at all material to the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy betwixt thoſe of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> and us. For if any Parties, or ſingle Perſons, have declared their ſenſe and opinions concerning any Doctrine, or matter of Practice, either that their opinion doth accord with Scripture, or it doth not: if it do, it is the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctrine; if it do not, it is not a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> Doctrine; and ſo it doth not at all affect us; ſince we own, that perſons profeſſing themſelves <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> may miſtake, as well as, we do declare our aſſurance, that thoſe who have been named Infallible, in another Communion, have erred moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly. But this we affirm that ſo far as any do keep ſtrictly and cloſely to the Holy Scriptures, they cannot miſtake. And <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have no real concern to vindicate any Party, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, any further than they do keep unto the Scripture.</p>
            <p>But now to return from theſe digreſſions, unto what was ſaid before, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have ſuch evidence, as doth create
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51123:15"/>
certain aſſurance, that the Holy Scriptures are fully perfect, to inſtruct and direct Believers in all matters of Religion, and do contain all thoſe Divine Revelations God hath appointed to be of neceſſary and perpetual uſe unto his Church. I need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the whole evidence that might be produced on this occaſion. I will therefore content my ſelf with theſe two particulars, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to this matter, which certainly muſt ſway powerfully with them who are under an influence which is truly Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</p>
            <p>The firſt, is this:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Holy Spirit of God hath expreſly declared, that the Holy Scriptures are compleat and perfect to all the ends and purpoſes of Divine Revelations. Hear how large and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar the Holy Spirit of God is, in declaring the Fullneſs and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Scriptures. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 16, 17. <hi>And that from a Child thou haſt known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wiſe unto Salvation, through Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus. All Scripture is given by Inſpiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; that the Man of God may be Perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all Good Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſame Holy Spirit hath ſolemnly devoted to the moſt dreadful Curſe of Almighty God, whomſoever ſhall be ſo arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and preſumptuous, as to offer any other Doctrine beſides what the Holy Scriptures do teach, as a Divine Revelation. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>But though we, or an Angel from Heaven, preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accurſed.</hi> Now if people will pretend to produce other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelations, which God hath appointed to be of perpetual uſe to his Church; either thoſe muſt invalidate theſe Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; or elſe theſe Holy Scriptures muſt invalidate them; they cannot conſiſt well together. If we will own and ſtick to the Holy Scriptures, we muſt reject whatever additional Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhall be produced; becauſe, the Spirit hath, in theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, excluded them.</p>
            <p>What hath been diſcourſed concerning the evidence <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> have for their great and main Principle, may juſtly promt to take notice of two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they who would hinder and diſcourage people from reading and ſtudying the Holy Scriptures, do give them juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſuſpect, that they have none of the honeſteſt and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51123:16"/>
moſt commendable deſigns to manage. We are very certain, the Holy Prophets of God, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, were Perſons beloved of God, and Perſons who were greatly concerned for Peoples Spiritual Welfare; and we are as certain, that theſe were very much, and in good earneſt, in preſſing, exciting, and perſwading the common ſort of People to read and ſtudy the Scriptures; they command them in the Name of God, to read and learn the Scriptures, and thoſe Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Mind of God, which were communicated unto them; read <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>John</hi> 5. 39. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. Nay, does not the deſign and end for which God hath made his Will known, and caus'd it to be committed to Writing, manifeſt and prove our Duty evidently enough? For what end hath God given the Holy Scriptures unto his Church and People? Are we not aſſured that the Scriptures were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our Learning, for our Inſtruction, for our Admonition? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And muſt we not read them then? How will they anſwer theſe ends, if we muſt not conſult them? Were not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures written for our Learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might have Hope? Read and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. Have we not then too much ground to ſuſpect, that thoſe who would take, or keep our Bibles from us, are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to our Faith, Patience, Comfort, Hope, and Happineſs? Is not the Word of God that Sword of the Spirit, with which we are to defend our ſelves, and worſt our Spiritual Enemies? <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 17. And now what reaſon have we to take them for our Friends, who would lay us open, and expoſe us Naked to the Aſſaults of Sathan and his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
            <p>The Holy Penmen of the Scriptures did, by the direction of the Bleſſed Spirit, commend People for applying themſelves to the Holy Scriptures, and endeavouring to improve in the knowledge of them. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11. <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 24. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. And it is certain, that the People of God (of every rank and condition) under the Old Teſtament Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, were obliged by Eſpecial Appointment from God, to take care to read, and labour after a continual Increaſe in the knowledge of the Scriptures. Now, can we imagine, that God having given us a larger Diſcovery of his Mind, doth diſpence with our neglect to ſearch the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:51123:16"/>
Can thoſe who are againſt the Lay-Peoples reading of the Scripture, find any Command of Chriſt, requiring them not to read the Scripture? Can they produce any Condemnation or Cenſure from the Prophets, from Chriſt, or from his Apoſtles, againſt thoſe who ſhall read the Word of God? Or can they make it appear, that any of theſe did ever commend People for their neglecting to read the Scripture? If they cannot do any of all this, let their Pretences and Self-vindications touching this matter, be never ſo plauſible, we may reſt aſſured, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſolid and ſubſtantial in what they ſay; for there cannot be any Reaſon againſt God. The more ſubtle and cunning their Pretences are, the worſe Men they manifeſt themſelves to be; becauſe they abuſe thoſe Abilities which ſhould have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied another way, and might, had they been uſed aright, have been very ſerviceable to promote the Intereſt of Truth and Holineſs.</p>
            <p>The moſt plauſible Pretence they do produce for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting People the common uſe of the Scripture, is, That the ordinary ſort of People would be very apt to abuſe and wreſt the Scriptures to their own Deſtruction, ſhould they be permitted to have free recourſe unto them. But allowing, that People may wreſt the Scripture, and make ſome other uſe of it than they ought, this is not an Inconvenience which will make null, and diſcharge Men from God's Command of reading and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture. You may, with as much reaſon, oblige Men to forbear the uſe of wholeſome Food, Meat and Drink, and ſtarve themſelves to death, becauſe ſome, by their Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Exceſs, do abuſe wholeſome Food, and make it an occaſion of dangerous Diſtempers and Diſeaſes, yea, and Death it ſelf. You may as lawfully deprive People of their Corporal, as of their Spiritual Food.</p>
            <p>Beſides, this very particular hath been foreſeen, and taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, by the Pen-men of the Holy Scripture, if we interpret 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. according to the uſual acceptation of that place, by thoſe who do alledge it for their purpoſe, as to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And yet there is not one word there, to oblige People, on that account, to deſiſt from the reading of the Scriptures. The People may, and ought to be warned to take heed how they read the Scriptures, and that they avoid Errours, and pervert not the Word of God. But the Scriptures are not therefore to be detained from them: God hath not thought fit to provide
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51123:17"/>
ſuch a Remedy againſt peoples abuſing his Word, as this is, of keeping it intirely from them. Yea, this very Apoſtle doth, as it were, in the next verſes, perſwade them to the due and right ſtudy, and improvement of the Scriptures, that they may avoid the Errours others do fall into, by abuſing them, and may <hi>increaſe in the knowledge of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is undeniably evident, that this ſame Apoſtle doth, in this ſame Epiſtle, commend peoples reading of the Scriptures, and attending unto them. <hi>We have alſo a more ſure Word of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whereunto ye do well, that ye take heed, as unto a Light that ſhineth in a dark place, until the Day dawn, and the Day-Star ariſe in your Hearts.</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 19.</p>
            <p>And, however it is common, to attribute the Riſe of Errours to the common ſort of peoples having the free uſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; yet, upon due examination, it will be found, that the worſt and moſt fatal Errous have ſprung from, and been advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by them, who pretending to more Knowledge and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Abilities than the reſt of Mankind, have preſumed to appropriate to themſelves the intire Cuſtody or Interpretation of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Nay, it is truly obſerved, by one who appears to have conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Antiquity with much care and diligence, <q>That The Laity ſo well underſtood their <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Catholick Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance.</hi> pag. 19.</note> Faith, that many times, they, by their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity, diſcerned the ſly Inſinuations of Errour, in the Sermons of their Unſound and Heretical Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; and ſo occaſioned them to be condemned by Synodical Sentences: and through the radicated ſenſe of Faith, would never be brought to any of the Alterations made by any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Councils; nor, would ever reſt under their Prevarications, till the Primitive Faith recovered, and vacated all thoſe Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodical Prevarications; as may be ſeen in all the <hi>Arian Hiſtory;</hi> and particularly, the relation given, of the vulgar Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity and Zeal, to detect and repreſs that Hereſy in St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> againſt the <hi>Luciferians.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If this Notion, of keeping the Scriptures from the people, or of obliging the People to underſtand the Scriptures no otherwiſe than thoſe would interpret them, who were arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant enough to claim, and aſſume to themſelves this priviledge, had intirely prevail'd, when our Bleſſed Saviour was on Earth, God only knows, how much our Saviour's Reputation might
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51123:17"/>
have ſuffered, even in ſucceeding Generations. For, as theſe preſumptuous Perſons did pretend, that the Key of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did hang only at their Girdle, ſo they refuſed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Chriſt was the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Son of God, and they both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed him as an Impoſtor, a Deceiver, an Ill Man; and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and cenſured the People as ignorant Perſons, who did not underſtand the Law, little better than <hi>Hereticks,</hi> a curſed Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: and all this was, becauſe they did liſten unto Chriſt, follow Him, and Believe in Him; that is, did undertake to judge of Matters by the Scripture; and to determine this was the Saviour, the Meſſiah, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> propheſied of, and promiſed in the Scriptures. The Chief <hi>Prieſts,</hi> the <hi>Scribes,</hi> the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> they were all againſt Chriſt, and would fain have perſwaded the People to have taken their Interpretation of the Scriptures, and to have pinn'd their Faith on their Sleeves, and not undertake to judge for themſelves in ſo high and myſterious a Point as this, concerning the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> was. They would have perſwaded them, that this <hi>Jeſus</hi> was a very Cheat, and that all the things he did, which won their admiration, were wrought by the Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy he had with, and the Power he borrowed from the Prince of the Devils; and that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> muſt be quite of another Make from this ſame <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, what work would have been in the World, if none muſt have read and underſtood the Scriptures in any other ſenſe but what the Topping-Men, and Chief Leaders of the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> had aſſigned? What contempt do theſe Monopolizers of Knowledge expreſs againſt the People, who would not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their Determinations? How angry were they, when any dared to declare how they reſpected and admired Chriſt? <hi>Then came the Officers to the Chief Prieſts and Phariſees, and they ſaid unto them, Why have ye not brought him? The Officers anſwered, never Man ſpake like this Man: Then anſwered them the Phariſees, Are ye alſo deceived? Have any of the Rulers or Phariſees believed on him? But this People who knoweth not the Law, are Curſed.</hi> John 7. 45. to the <hi>50th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If People mean fairly and honeſtly, why do they deſire to have Folks bred up in Ignorance? Indeed, if the ordinary ſort of People be well vers'd in the Holy Scriptures, it will not be eaſie to impoſe upon them. Why cannot Men, that would be Teachers now a days, be as open and plain as the Prophets, and as Chriſt, and as his Apoſtles were? Theſe came not to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51123:18"/>
vent any counterfeit falſe Wares, and therefore they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the People ſhould examine and try what they taught them: They were for the People's reading and ſearching of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and judging of the Doctrines which were taught them by thoſe Holy Scriptures, which had been delivered unto them. They came to deliver people out of Darkneſs, not to keep them in, or lead them unto Darkneſs. And thoſe who are their true Succeſſors and Followers, will do the like. If Men have no Notions to ſcatter about, and perſwade People to ſwallow and ſubmit to, but what are ſound, and true, and good, and which are authoriſed by Jeſus Chriſt, they will have no occaſion to be aſhamed or afraid, that People ſhould examine them by the Scripture. None flee from the Light, but thoſe whoſe Doctrines or Practices will not bear the Light. Chriſt's Doctrines did accord very well with thoſe Divine Revelations thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> had amongſt them: But the Unſcriptural Traditions they had got amongſt them, and our Saviour's Doctrines, could not ſtand together. <hi>To the Law, and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no Light in them.</hi> Iſaiah 8. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thoſe who profeſs themſelves <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ought to take care, that they be well fixed and ſettled in the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles often require their Followers and Diſciples, and thoſe they write unto, to <hi>Stand faſt in the Faith:</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 13. And to <hi>Contend earneſtly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints:</hi> Jude 3. And to <hi>Strive together for the Faith of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel:</hi> Phil. 1. 27. Now, by theſe and the like Expreſſions, which you meet with in the Apoſtolick Writing, they plainly, <hi>firſt,</hi> warn them of the danger there is, of Peoples Apoſtarizing from the True Faith and Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, after that they have made a Profeſſion of the ſame. And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> excite and ſtir thoſe up, who make a Profeſſion of the True Faith, to take care that their Minds and Hearts may be throughly fixed and ſettled in the Faith, leaſt they ſhould yield and waver, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, when Storms and Tryals ſhall ariſe, and their conſtancy ſhall be aſſaulted.</p>
            <p>And, if there be but too much ground to fear, that many who make a Profeſſion of the Truth, will Apoſtatize, and forſake it, when they ſhall be called to bear witneſs to it, in ſome Inſtances which are ungrateful to Fleſh and Blood. It highly concerns
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51123:18"/>
all, who at preſent profeſs True Chriſtianity, to look well to it, that they be ſo eſtabliſhed and confirmed in what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that if a day of Tryal ſhould come, they may not looſe their Crown, deſtroy their Souls, or betray the Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thoſe who do profeſs the True Religion, may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Apoſtatize from, and relinquiſh it. And there is too great occaſion to fear, that many, however forward they appear in Profeſſion, will do ſo, ſhould they be tryed in any difficult and beloved Inſtances: I do not mean, that People who have long habituated themſelves to profeſs the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be brought to an open and avowed renouncing of the Name of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> as though none could be juſtly charged with Apoſtacy from the Truth, but thoſe who can vye with <hi>Julian</hi> for impudence, in contemning and trampling under foot the very Name and Profeſſion of the Son of God. The eſtate of thoſe who proceed ſo far, is beyond meaſure dreadful. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>But there are two things, which the Scriptures more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally inſiſt on, as imported by People's Apoſtatizing from the True Faith, and which, People are generally too prone unto; and both which are very diſpleaſing unto, and greatly provoking of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Departing from the Purity and Simplicity of the Faith of the Goſpel, eſpouſing and imbracing, together with thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and Practices which Chriſt hath authorized in his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, other Opinions and Practices, which are deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of the Truth and power of Religion. <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is as really impaired and injured by evil mixtures, as by open profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed oppoſition. The Apoſtacy the Apoſtles ſpake of, which was to accompany, or rather, conſtitute that great Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian State, they foretel, would have ſuch a vaſt, and large, and durable Empire in the Chriſtian World, ſeems plainly to be of this kind. The great Fundamental Doctrines of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> ſhould be retained in outward Profeſſion, but yet other Doctrines ſhould be introduced, and be ſo vehemently impoſed, and inſiſted on, that thereby the main Eſſential of Religion ſhould be ſlighted, oppreſſed, and become in a great meaſure uſeleſs. And way has been made for theſe Innovations, by <hi>firſt,</hi> forging ſome groſs Impoſtures, and counterfeiting ſome ſtrange things, to which they have given the Name of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51123:19"/>
and ſo unwary, ignorant People have been prevailed with to entertain no better than Diabolical Deluſions as Divine Inſtructions and Commands: very agreeable to what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle foretells of Antichriſt's coming; <hi>After the working of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than with all Power, and Signs, and lying Wonders:</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Altering the nature and uſe of many things which were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novated, by the pious Antients, without any Divine Authority, and purely by the conduct of a warm Zeal, and a devout Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Had no further progreſs been made in thoſe Inſtances, than thoſe Antients made, little prejudice would thence have happened to Religion. But God is ſo jealous of his own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that uſually, when People manifeſt they have an Opinion that God hath not carefully enough provided for his own Cauſe, and therefore they will guard and ſence, and provide more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually for it; He blaſts all thoſe Devices, and ſuffers ſuch Humane Inventions to be occaſions of more than ordinary trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and ſometimes, to be proſecuted ſo far, as to make a formal and mortal Oppoſition to the Vitals of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Depreſſing the Offices and Devotional Duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with unreaſonable heaps of outward Formalities, and Ritual Obſervations; that ſo the Senſes might be ſuperfluouſly careſt; and by accomodating the Matters of Religion too much to the Rules of Carnal Policy. By this means, inward Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and the Spirituality of Religion, have been diſpenc't with; and Peoples Minds have been rendred lax and vain, aiery and gariſh. And having been thus inured for ſome time to theſe meer Externals, which they have taken upon truſt, they have at laſt been ſo eaſie, as to content themſelves with an Implicite Faith, and have rather choſe to ſwallow any thing that ſhould be offered them, whole, than put themſelves to the trouble to enquire into its Nature, Riſe, and Grounds.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Finding out ways to reconcile what they ſtile Religion, to Men's Carnal Luſts, and Natural Tempers and Conſtitutions; deviſing eaſier ways (as they pretend) to Heaven, than any of the Saints in former Ages, were acquainted with: deviſing new ways to ſatisfie for Sin, and undertaking to ſave Mens Souls after they are dead in Sins.</p>
            <p>Hence there is ſomething Men call Religion, that muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly pleaſe the Careleſs, and (as ſome tell us) as certainly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51123:19"/>
Save them. If you are melancholly, and inclined to ſtrictneſs and Corporal Mortifications, they will humour you in that; they can provide you Pennances and Securities, which ſhall ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently vex and macerate your Fleſh. If you are ſoft and tender if you would have a Jovial Religion, and would allow your ſelves in wantonneſs and exceſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet not miſcarry at laſt, they can fit you with Indulgencies and Pardons, and will not queſtion to ſend you ſafely to Heaven, by vertue of the Merits and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of ſome of their Antient Friends, who never had a Being in the World; or, of others, who tho they might have a Being here on Earth, in all probability, never got to Heaven themſelves: I am ſure, they never had Righteouſneſs enough of their own to carry them to Heaven, however it is grown ſo bulky ſince they left it behind them, and has crept into the Churche's Treaſury. But the Apoſtle acquaints us, that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> will come <hi>with all deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs in them that periſh:</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>condly,</hi> Declining from their Love to, and Zeal for the Faith, growing cold and indifferent concerning the Faith; when People have not that affection and concern for the Faith, with which they ſeemed at firſt to entertain and welcome it. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>People are too prone thus to Apoſtatize from the True Faith, after that they have made a Profeſſion of it: and if Matters be well conſidered, there is not much ground to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſhould be ſo: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. People do too ordinarily make a Profeſſion of the Faith, upon unſuitable Motives and Principles: not becauſe they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, and have their Conſciences convinced of its truth and excellency; but meerly becauſe it is the faſhion and cuſtome of the People where they live, to make ſuch a Profeſſion; or, it is a Profeſſion that has got into repute; or, upon ſome other ſuch mean and fickle Account. Men that have no ſound Principles, will ever be for that Profeſſion which is uppermoſt, and is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with moſt Pomp and Pleaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt had Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers in abundance, whil'ſt he fed them with Loaves, but how did they fall off, and ſlink away, when they failed of their Expectations. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 26.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Multitudes content themſelves with a meer notional know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Religion, and take no due care to digeſt Truths, and turn the Principles of Religion into ſolid Nouriſhment: Now
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51123:20"/>
the Doctrines of Religion, if they do not ſink down into our Hearts, if they have not a powerful efficacy on our Affections, if they do not put us invincibly upon ſuch a Courſe of Life, as bears ſome proportion with their nature and tendency, they have no faſt hold on us, they will ſoon evaporate, we ſhall eaſily part with them. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 49. Let the Food we eat, be never ſo good and wholeſome for the kind, if we do not digeſt it, if our Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks do not turn it into good Chyle and Nutriment, it will ſoon become nauſeous, and the leaſt provocation will make us vomit it up again.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God doth often, in juſt Judgment, leave thoſe to be hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by an evil Spirit of Deluſion and Impiety, who having long injoyed the means for their inſtruction and ſettlement in the True Faith, have made no careful improvement of the ſame, for thoſe ends. God ordinarily ſuffers ſuch to be led away by <hi>Sathan</hi> and his lying Emiſſaries, into Opinions drame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoſite to the plaineſt Truths, as well as to thoſe vile affections which prompt to all uncleanneſs, and practices which are inconvenient, even according to the dictates of natural Light. Such are a ready and ſelf-prepared prey to him, whoſe coming is after the workings of <hi>Sathan,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Over-loading Eccleſiaſtical Offices with Worldly Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, Temporal Power and Dignities, hath contributed very much to the prejudice of <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> Too true did that voice prove, <hi>This day is poiſon poured into the Church.</hi> Theſe things are powerful baits, and ſtrong temptations to ambitious, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, domineering Perſons. Thoſe who have ſuch Offices ſo dreſt up and beautined, to confer and beſtow, need not doubt, but they ſhall find Advocates enough, for their own particular Opinions and Ways, though never ſo Erroneous. And when Errours and Superſtitions are back't with Power, Greatneſs, Wealth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh, what multitudes will they draw after them! Beſides, when thoſe who have not a mighty concern for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of real Religion, are too much advanc't in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, and rais'd above themſelves, it too uſually falls out, that an arbitrary Imperiouſneſs ſtarts up, and prevails, and then things of no great moment, and for which Chriſt and his Apoſtles thought not fit to ingage their Authority, or lay any ſtreſs of Religion on, get into their heads, and muſt needs be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51123:20"/>
made terms of <hi>Chriſtian Communion,</hi> that they may be ſure their Authority is acknowledged. What Conteſts and Diviſions have been raiſed and created by this means? What Heats and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities have been this way occaſioned? Hereby Differences have been carried to ſuch heights, that at laſt Religion it ſelf is even loſt in the Quarrels commenc't about its Veſtments and Trappings. How have People's zeal or fury about things, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Indifferent, extirpated or quenched all ſerious and due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment for the true Intereſts of Religion! 'Tis to be feared, that hence there is occaſioned an indifferency in the minds of multitudes, touching the great Subſtantials of Religion, which doth ſurpaſs the Indifferency of the things themſelves, for which we have ſo deſperately contended. The love of Worldly Grandure carried <hi>Demas</hi> away from the Faith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. And over much concernedneſs for little Extra-Religious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, gave the Apoſtle ground to ſuſpect, that thoſe who were ſo affected, would not be ſo honeſt, firm, and faithful to the Faith of the Goſpel, as good <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ought to be: Obſerve how he expoſtulates with them, and lays down the grounds of his fears touching them. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p n="5">5. God permits Afflictions, Perſecutions, and Sufferings to be brought on them who profeſs his Truth, not only to try the Graces of the Faithful, and to make their Graces appear more illuſtrious by their eminent exerciſe; but that Hypocrites and meer Formaliſts, who have no real love for his Truths, nor give any hearty aſſent unto them, may be diſcovered, and have their diſguiſes taken away. In times of peace and quiet, and whil'ſt the true Religion is on the thriving hand in the World, many pretend to it, who too much reſemble <hi>Eraſmus</hi>'s Good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, who appeared a very zealous Profeſſor, he would always have a New Teſtament hanging at his Girdle, on one ſide; but then he muſt have a Bottle of good Sack hanging on the other ſide.</p>
            <p>As long as the True Faith hath outward Honours, Preferment, Carnal Pleaſures, and Eaſe accompanying it, it will not want Followers and Attendants: but when Storms and Perſecutions do ariſe, and it is ſeparated from theſe external Allurements, they will ſoon ſhake hands with Religion, and court whatſoever ſhall be dreſt up in its former Robes. Such as eſpouſe the True Religion, not for its native Excellency, but for its gorgeous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and great Dowry in this World, will in all probability,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51123:21"/>
when Perſecutions ariſe, part with their Faith rather than their Pleaſures, Wealth, and Eaſe; they will ſooner throw away their Bibles rather than their Bottles. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 20, 21.</p>
            <p>Now, if there be ſuch danger of people's Apoſtatizing from the True Faith, after they have made a profeſſion of it, it muſt certainly very importantly concern all who profeſs the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, that is, <hi>True Chriſtianity,</hi> as taught and delivered in the Holy Scriptures, and as purged and reformed by the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and direction of this Divine Rule, from all thoſe Errours and Corruptions which have, either through people's heedleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, crept into the profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> or, through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, have been ſlily uſhered into it, or, by imperiouſneſs, have been forc't upon it: I ſay, it very highly concerns them to take care, that their Minds and Hearts be ſo fixed and ſettled in the Faith of the Goſpel, that they may never be removed from their Conſtancy, that <hi>they may not be as Children toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of Doctrine, by the ſlight of Men, and cunning craftineſs, whereby they lye in wait to deceive.</hi> Eph. 4. 14.</p>
            <p>It ſhould therefore be our care to get our Minds furniſhed with clear diſtinct Notions of thoſe Truths in which the Scriptures do inſtruct people: It is not enough, that we can talk over, in a general way, the Doctrines of Religion; we ought to labour for an explicite knowledge of Divine Revelations; ſo that we may be able to prove and confirm every part of our Profeſſion by expreſs and clear Scriptures; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>The Ignorant Man will be always wavering.</hi> Yea, we ſhould ſtrive to get the Truths we profeſe and underſtand, very ſtrongly indeared unto our Hearts, ſo as to prefer them above all Worldly and Carnal Intereſts; and to have our Affections, yea, our whole Souls brought under their Power and Influence, their Government and Soveraignty: our Souls ſhould ſo cleave unto them, they ſhould be ſo precious and dear unto us, that neither Frowns nor Smiles, Promiſes nor Threats, may make any unhappy impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on us; but the more bluſtering any Storms may be, which can ariſe, the deeper root we may take, and grow the more firm and ſtable. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27, 28. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We muſt expect to meet with Tryals and Sufferings for the Faith of the Goſpel, which will overwhelm and ruine us, if we be not well provided againſt them. Our Paſſage to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51123:21"/>
is through many Tribulations. We have many and various Enemies, who will miſchief us, and obſtruct us all they can, who will do their utmoſt to prevail with us, both by fair and foul means, to make ſhipwrack both of Faith and a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: We are not only expoſed to the malice, rage, and ſpite of abſurd and unreaſonable Men, but to the craft and fury too of thoſe infernal Fiends, who prompt and excite their carnal and earthly Tools and Inſtruments, to vent and vomit forth their rancour and ſpleen againſt the True Faith and its Profeſſors. See <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12, 13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8, 9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. If you be not well fixed in the Truth, how can you expect to hold out, when temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and ſufferings ſhall come? When you ſhall be in danger of looſing Eſtate, Liberty, all that is dear to you in the World, yea, Life it ſelf, for your Religion? Did not the Houſe built upon the Sand fall, when the Rain deſcended, and the Winds blew, and beat upon it? <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 26, 27.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Apoſtacy from the True Faith is a very hainous provoking ſin: is not this to offer God the utmoſt affront we can, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, to ſay all manner of evil of him? Do we not hereby charge him with being the greateſt Impoſtor that ever was? Is not this to throw the fouleſt dirt that is poſſible upon Religion; yea, openly to avow, that Sathan and his drudgery are much better, more ligible than Chriſt and his moſt Holy Faith? That God is not to be truſted, and that his Religion is not what he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it? O what abominable, what innumerable, what mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous wickedneſſes are bred in the womb of Apoſtacy! And what direful conſequences and fruits may thoſe expect, who thus affront, and incenſe the Almighty God againſt themſelves! He will not have a gracious regard for ſuch: He will caſt off, and puniſh ſeverely, all thoſe that caſt him off, and deal treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly with Him. <hi>The Juſt ſhall live by Faith, but if any Man draw back, my Soul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> Heb. 10. 38. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt will reject them, and be aſhamed of them, when he ſhall appear in all his Glory. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and ſinful Generation of him alſo ſhall the Son of Man be aſhamed, when he cometh in the Glory of his Father, with the Holy Angels.</hi> Mark 8. 38. Though you ſet no value on Chriſt's Love at preſent; and care for no more, but that you may have the Countenance of great Perſons, and injoy the Pleaſures and Wealth of the World; yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that it will not be long, before ye ſhall have other appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51123:22"/>
of things than now you have: It will not be long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall perceive all theſe things you prefer before the Faith of the Goſpel, to be very empty, and void of all ſatisfaction, and full of torment and horrour: when Chriſt ſhall appear in Glory, with his Holy Angels, all theſe things will fail you: and how you will howl and roar, and complain then? What tears will you then ſhed? How will you curſe your Apoſtacy, and all that helpt it forward? And now, when your Caſe is thus help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, thus dreadful, and all your Comforters are gone, the Lord Jeſus and his Mercy will fail you too; he will ſend you to them, whoſe favour you prefer'd before his, who will tremble and quake as much as you; and to your Wealth, which will then diſappear; and to your beloved Pleaſures, which will then be bitterer than <hi>Gall</hi> and <hi>Wormwood:</hi> you muſt only expect to behold his frowns, and to feel the terrible diſcoveries of his inſupportable diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: you can expect no favour at his Hands. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24. to the end. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 7, 8, 9. Nay, you have no good ground to hope you ſhall proſper in any of thoſe deſigns you intend to drive forward by, or under your Apoſtacy. God doth very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten notably blaſt ſuch projects; He cauſeth ſome remarkable and very fatal Curſe to accompany thoſe who relinquiſh his Cauſe and Truth. What was <hi>Judas</hi> the better for his thirty pieces of Silver? What a ſorry Plaiſter was this for a wounded Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? What a poor comfort to a juſtly deſpairing Soul? What a fearful end have they ordinarily come to, who have forſaken Chriſt and the Goſpel for Preferment, Wealth, or any Carnal Intereſts?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The more we are confirmed in the Faith, the greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of inward Comſort we may confidently look for, if we ſhould be called to ſuffer for the Truth. God will not leave ſuch comfortleſs, they ſhall have experience of his gracious, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing Preſence and Supports. The Diſciples, when publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſgraced and whipt, <hi>they went away rejoycing, that they were counted worthy to ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt.</hi> See <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 41. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You will hereby be in a capacity of doing others eminent ſervice, by your Inſtruction, and Counſel, and Example. It is a great mercy not to cumber the World, not to live uſeleſsly and unprofitably, to do real good Services to people in our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: nay, more, you will hereby be in a capacity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much to retrieve the Credit and Honour of Religion; which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51123:22"/>
has indeed been horridly betraid, and proſtituted by Hypocrites, and wicked pretenders to it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Promiſe of God is only to thoſe who ſtand faſt, who do perſevere and overcome. A Profeſſion, be it never ſo good and Orthodox for the matter of it, will turn to no good and comfortable account to particular Perſons, unleſs they faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adhere to, and perſiſt therein. <hi>To them who by patient continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in well doing, ſeek for Glory, Honour, Immortality, and Eternal Life.</hi> Rom. 2. 7. <hi>To him than overcometh, will I give to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God.</hi> Rev. 2. 7. Rev. 2. 5. <hi>He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he ſhall be my Son.</hi> Rev. 21. 7.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and conſiderations of the like nature, which will eaſily occur unto you, ſhould make ſome impreſſion on you. Have you had your Bibles ſo long, and means of Inſtruction, ſo much above all others, who are of the contrary Perſwaſion; and what, will you now throw away your Bibles, as being imperfect? Will you hood-wink your ſelves, or be content to be led blindfold, by Guides that either cannot, or will not ſee? Are you weary of the glorious Light of the Goſpel? What ſort of people are they in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Judgment, who diſlike the glorious Light of the Goſpel? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3, 4. Can you now at laſt be contented with the poor Glow-worm light of ſimple Tradition; or, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain wavering of <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> which certainly leads all who fooliſhly reſign up themſelves to its conduct, out of the true way into very hazardous Inconveniences? Quit you like Men, yea, quit you like Chriſtians; labour and ſtrive to get your Minds and Hearts juſtly fixed in the Religion you profeſs. Be not ſo ſoft and eaſie, be not ſo fooliſh and inconſiderable, be not ſo unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, ſo diſtracted, ſo irreligious, as to ſuffer your ſelves to be ſo frighted out of your Religion, or ſlattered and collogued, cheated, and childiſhly allured out of it; nor yet to be ſo jeared and laught, and lampooned out of it; and then you'l be pritty ſafe: for their Arguments and Reaſonings (if you are wiſe) will never do you hurt.</p>
            <p>The Religion you profeſs, contains all in it that is neceſſary, yea, that can be really uſeful to any Man, in order unto his having a ſafe and ſure conduct to Heaven; and, why ſhould any Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to go further? None of the Apoſtles, none of the antient Martyrs, dared either to die for, or teach any other Doctrines
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51123:23"/>
than what your Religion doth comprize. And what! will it not content you to keep pace with them? Muſt you needs exceed and outſtrip them? Take need, the more ambitious, proud, and preſumptuous you are, the leſs ſafe you are. <hi>Lucifer</hi> and his Comrades had the moſt dreadful and unhappieſt fall that ever Creatures had; and it may be, to be wiſe above, or (if you like the Phraſe better) to be Religious beyond the Scripture, may in the end, prove to have a great Affinity with that they were guilty of. And if ſo, the puniſhment of that fault, muſt bear ſome proportion with the other. I would cheriſh as much cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, with reference to thoſe who manifeſt any pious Sentiments, in the Perſwaſion contrary to ours, as is poſſible. But yet I muſt needs ſay, that no ſolid proof hath ever yet been produced, that any Perſons ever yet ſuffered death comfortably for any of their peculiar and proper Doctrines taken abſtractedly from thoſe which we juſtly profeſs, and was accepted with God for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But we have Inſtances enough, of thoſe who have joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully laid down their Lives for the Doctrines we profeſs, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractedly from all thoſe wherein they differ from us; that is, thoſe which they have added to the Scriptures, and the ſuffering, and bearing witneſs to the Truths we own and profeſs, have been of great account with God. Should the worſt you can imagine follow on your firm adhering to the Faith you profeſs, <hi>viz.</hi> That you ſhall be perſecuted and ſuffer for it; yet this ſhould not ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle nor diſcompoſe you. That is but a ſorry Religion, that is not worth ſuffering for. There has been more Blood cheerfully parted with, more Tortures joyfully endured for the Religion you profeſs, than for any, it may be, for all other Cauſes in the World. If you are called to ſuffer on this Account, your Cauſe is ſo good, you need not be afraid of any Enemies terrours, you have no occaſion to be troubled. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 14. The Comfort is unexpreſſible, which you may warrantably expect. The Holy Spirit is promiſed to be a Comforter, more eſpecially, to thoſe who are perſecuted, and who ſuffer for this Religion. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 7. What glorious Rewards are there for you in Heaven? The more like you are to Chriſt in his Sufferings, the more you ſhall reſemble him in Glory. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 11, 12. Alas! conſider matters well, though the worſt ſhould come to the worſt. Shall you looſe your Eſtates, your Wealth, your Houſes, your Friends, your Relations, yea, your Lives? And what then! What are theſe to your Souls! What are theſe to Eternal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry!
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51123:23"/>
Theſe are poor, mean, uncertain, periſhing things at beſt theſe may be taken away from you on other Accounts; you may have all theſe, and yet no Comfort. But you may be exerciſed, (will you ſay) with cruel Uſages, with Tortures impoſſible, according to Humane Judgment, to be born with any patience. Be it ſo, make the worſt you can of it, they cannot be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, for vehemence and horrour, to the Torments in Hell; they cannot lie in the Ballance with the Glory and Joy of Heaven. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18. Be they never ſo great, one ſmile from Chriſt will render you inſenſible of the pian. How many, upon the Racks, and in Flames, for this Religion, have publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and manifeſted they felt no pain? And have you ſuch nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous examples and preſidents, take heart then, and go on as they did, joyfully in the ſtrengrh of you God. How many have ventured all, and ſuſtained all, both in former Ages, and in this preſent Age, in a neighbouring Countrey, with aſtoniſhing Joy, for this ſelf ſame Religion? But Oh! what will you looſe, and what muſt you ſuffer, if you wickedly depart from your God, and renounce his Truth? Would you be in <hi>Judas</hi> his deſpair, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain the horrour <hi>Spira</hi> was filled with, for Worldly Favour and Preferment? Would you be willing, for eaſe and pleaſure here, to be the object of God's heavieſt diſpleaſure for ever? To be ſhut out of Heaven, to be continually followed with God's Curſe? To be a perpetual Companion of Devils, and the worſt Sinners? To lie roaring and howling, to all Eternity, in unquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able flames? In a word, conſider how the Faith you profeſs, is the Faith which God Almighty hath taught and appointed, which the Lord Jeſus hath born witneſs unto, and ſealed with his Blood, which the Apoſtles preached to the World, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for; the Faith which has been juſtified and confirmed by multitudes of moſt real and undeniable Miracles; a Faith that is pure and peaceable, and tends moſt intirely to propagate and increaſe all that is truely excellent and praiſe-worthy amongſt Men; a Faith which God hath taken care of in all Ages of the Chriſtian World, and which aſſures its ſincere Profeſſors of things incomprehenſibly great and glorious hereafter, and fills them with unſpeakable peace and comfort at preſent, amidſt all the Suffering they can be expoſed to, on its account: a Faith God hath wonderfully freed from the Corruptions which were formerly mixed with it, in theſe Nations; and for which, He hath often and even miraculouſly appeared, in diſcovering and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51123:24"/>
blaſting the projects, the deſigns, and the attempts of its moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and unreconcileable Enemies: a Faith your Anceſtors, after mature conſideration, priz'd above all their worldly Intereſts, and Lives: a Faith, they took a great deal of care and pains to have tranſmitted to you pure and undefiled: a Faith, which brought with it multitudes of outward Bleſſings; and which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned theſe Nations to be eas'd of a Yoke, which all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, who had ingenious ſenſe, complained often of, and groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under: a Faith you cannot part with, but in all probability, you will again involve your ſelves in Calamities and Miſeries, like to thoſe out of which your Predeceſſors ſtrove with all their might to extricate themſelves. Have you an ambition now, to expoſe your ſelves and your Poſterity to all the miſchief and evil, which people of the adverſe perſwaſion, have been known induſtrious and unwearied to bring upon thoſe they look upon as Hereticks? Are you reſolved to pull down with your own hands, upon your ſelves, all the ſad and direful Plagues which are reſerved to be inflicted, in the next World, on them who perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly betray the Faith of the Goſpel, and wickedly Apoſtatize from the True Religion? If not, then take care, and look well to your ſelves, and ſee that you be fixed and confirmed in the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> And therefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Be ſure you be built upon the true Foundation. Take heed you profeſs not the True Faith, meerly becauſe it is owned by any Society of ſome particular extrinſical denomination: any particular Church may fall. There is a Body of Men now in the World, who aſſume to themſelves a very glorious Title; and yet, when a juſt enquiry is made, and the largeſt allowances Charity can prompt to, are yielded them, that Society can only paſs for a very corrupt part of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church: and yet the antient Inhabitants of that place where the Head of this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety hath fixed his <hi>See,</hi> were a people, in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, ſo hearty in, and true to the Doctrines of Chriſt, their Faith was ſpoken of throughout all the World. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 8. Where are any tracts and footſteps now, of thoſe Churches you read of in the <hi>Revelations?</hi> And yet God never forſaketh any, till they firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him. There has been, I fear there is ſtill, altogether a fault amongſt us, that we are immoderately concerned for the credit and outward grandure of particular Parties; and Chriſtians are reſpected, not for their being Chriſtians, but for their eſpouſing ſome diſtinguiſhing Notions and Characters of Man's deviſing.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51123:24"/>
I am perſwaded, God will utterly overthrow, at leaſt, mightily abaſe Men's affections to, and zeal for all Party-making Notions amongſt Chriſtians, before he will raiſe his Church to that proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous, flouriſhing State propheſied of, and promiſed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. There muſt be more Love, and Charity, and Unanimity amongſt Chriſtians. Chriſtianity will endure to the End of the World: but as for all the Modes and Faſhions of Man's deviſing, wherewith any do dreſs up the Profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> theſe may all fall to the Earth, as the Inventers of them have fall'n, or will fall. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 15. The True Foundation you ſhould be built upon, is that of the <hi>Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt Himſelf being the Chief Corner-Stone.</hi> Eph. 2. 20. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Embrace nothing as an Article of Faith, or part of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but what the Holy Scriptures are expreſs, or very clear concerning. You have in theſe Scriptures all that is neceſſary to any Man's Salvation. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. 17. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 13. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no Man, nor no Society of Men in theſe Caſes, further than the Scriptures do warrant what they teach. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8. 20.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Be not extreamly hot and zealous about any thing, but what the purity of Faith, and power of Godlineſs are really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in. Good Men and Orthodox Chriſtians may have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent apprehenſions about Matters of ſmall moment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much prejudice to their own Souls, or the common Faith, provided theſe Differences be managed without uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unchriſtian violence: But too much heat and violence about things, diverts from the weighty matters of God's Laws, and Religion ſoon ſenſibly decays. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Expect and prepare for Tryals. Chriſt hath dealt plainly and openly with us: <hi>In the World ye ſhall have Troubles.</hi> See <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24. Learn to reſign up your ſelves, and live in expectation of Sufferings. Read 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Be earneſt in Prayer, that your Hearts and Souls may have an inward, real, ſpiritual, affectionate ſenſe of the Truth and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the Doctrines of Chriſtianity. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12, 13, 14.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:51123:25"/>
6. Study the Holy Scriptures diligently, and make them your dayly delight. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 97, 98.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Make a good Improvement of the plain, faithful Miniſtry of the Word, whil'ſt you can injoy it: you know not what Times may come. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3, 4.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Take heed of Self-confidence, and depend wholly on thy Saviour.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Learn to be expert in uſing every part of the Chriſtian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. Watch your ſelves carefully, and your Enemies too. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Take a due care that your Faith may effectually influence you to all Holineſs of Life and Converſation. That Man is in a great preparation to renounce his Faith, that hath proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Conſcience, and is regardleſs how he lives. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
            <p>Read, conſider, and improve what is offered unto you, and the God of all Grace, who hath called us to his Eternal Glory, by Chriſt Jeſus, after that we have ſuffered a while, make you Perfect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
