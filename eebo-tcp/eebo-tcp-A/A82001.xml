            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> as is made more clearly to appear in one of thoſe Parallels, that treat of your happy Promotion and Succeſſion to the Throne, where you now ſit.</p>
            <p>As for the imputation of flattery, it is known, that I have ever ſo much abhorred from all that, and thoſe ſubtile Artiſts of Fortune, who make a Trade of it, that whilſt I have been converſant in the Courts of ſome great Princes, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly known to many of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I have been alwayes moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely taxt, of too much of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extreme: much leſſe ſhould I dare to offer any thing of that now, to your moſt Serene Highneſſe, who are known to hold ſo much of the vertue, of your moſt Renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Father in you, as to be better pleaſed to meet with an enemy, in
<pb facs="tcp:170384:3"/>
open field, than a flattering friend in your Privy Chamber. Inſomuch, that I am afraid to tell your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſome notorious truths; how all we your people, look upon you, as our ſecond <hi>Joſhua,</hi> in the place of our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> as full of the ſpirit of Wiſdom, Courage, and Piety, as he was, and that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at all doubt, but your ſucceſſes will be likewiſe moſt proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his; how Walls, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſhall fall before you, Gyants wax pale, Rivers retire back, the Sun it ſelf ſtand ſtill, and as many Kings will undergoe your yoke.</p>
            <p>I am afraid to tell you Sir, how we, that are your people, are all of us employ'd, in planting more Bayes, and Laurel in our Gardens, to en-garland your Victorious browes, before you come to a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. In fine, I am afraid to tell
<pb facs="tcp:170384:4"/>
you, how all our hearts, like Roſes, withered upon the death of your glorious Father, now begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to bloom afreſh, and newly to open our ſelves, at the benigne, gentle, &amp; glorious, Princely Aſpect, of your moſt Serene Highneſſe: No, I know to tell your goodneſſe any thing of this, would be but to offend it, and to commit a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge upon your moſt precious time: So Ile forbear, and onely proſecute my petitions for more pardons ſtill; and Princes upon their firſt inaugurations, ſeldome deny any, whoſe crimes carry not ſome extraordinary atrocity with them; much leſſe can I doubt of indulgence, from your moſt Serene Highneſſe, who are a Perſon ſo compoſed of Grace, and Clemency it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Your pardon therefore gracious
<pb facs="tcp:170384:4"/>
Sir again, that I preſume to addreſs theſe poor unpoliſht papers, to ſo great a Patronage as yours. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, mighty Sir, if that the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency of the Subject, treated on in theſe Diſcourſes, had not given me great encouragement, I ſhould never have dared to offer this Piece to your view, much leſſe to your protection: but it being conſcious to it ſelf, that it contains nothing, but meer Commentaries upon your glorious Fathers Words and Actions, it humbly conceives, that your Highneſſe has ſo great a propriety in it, and that it has ſo near a Relation to your Highneſſe, that it boldly begins to challenge, your moſt Serene Candour, and particular Protection: and would argue me of an extreme inſolence, to go about to ſeek for its Birth, under any other favour. For may
<pb facs="tcp:170384:5"/>
it pleaſe your Highneſſe to take it as a little Hiſtory, of your moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Father; who ſhould it come to for Licence, Approbation, Countenance, and Priviledge, but your Sacred ſelf, who are the Compendium of his incomparable Life, and the living Epitome of all his Perfections, and are growing up very ſpeedily, to be as great a Volume.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſe your Highneſſe, to take it as a piece of Architecture, or Moſaick Work (as it is) erected upon the Memory of your decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Father; whom ſhould it have recourſe to, for its Pillar, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, but onely your Highneſſe, who are the moving Model of all his Great Actions? And may your Highneſſe pleaſe to take it, as a Table or Picture, of your Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father; Who is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb facs="tcp:170384:5"/>
in it, than your Gracious ſelf, that are as much the lively Image of his Vertues, as of the Majeſty of his Perſon.</p>
            <p>Thus then, for the ſcope and buſineſſe of the Book, I dare affirm it to be without exception, great and good, and ſo I dare preſent it boldly to your moſt Serene High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and avouch it equal to any Kings Cabinet whatſoever in the World; though truly for the ruſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of its dreſſe, which is meerly my fault, it may not be, for ought I know, admitted by the over-curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The plain truth is, and I am not aſhamed to acknowledge it to your Highneſſe, that I have been ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon the maine matter, that it may be I have neglected ſomething of the form, or to give it the due dreſſe and ornament of Language; and to word it truly as it ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:170384:6"/>
have been, would have required no leſſe than the pen of a Seraphim: but my comfort is, that your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, like your great Father, in that as well as all his other Excellencies, has been ever a moſt declared ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to that kind of pitiful oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of words, as well as cloathes, and knows how to make a value of a pure Oriental Pearle, though covered with a courſe ſhell, and how to accept of a precious ſweet Perfume, though ſhut up within an abject Box. So I hope it ſhall not offend your Highneſſe, and that will ſuffice me, not to have imitated thoſe that preſerve Oranges and Limons, who neglecting the rich juice, and inſide of the fruit, do candy and preſerve the meer Rine, and outſide onely.</p>
            <p>But yet I have another pardon to beg of your moſt Serene Highneſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:170384:6"/>
which muſt be granted, after all this, or I am eternally ruined, and that is, for dareing to undertake, or touch with my rude hands, this moſt curious piece of Moſaick Work, which ſhould ſerve for a Monument upon your immortal Fathers Memory, well knowing, that no tongue which has not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions equal to his Expeditions, or a pen that cannot parallel his Sword, is capable to deliver any juſt Character of him.</p>
            <p>What Language, Pen, or Penſil, can poſſibly delineate, that moſt invincible Spirit of his, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered Men and Devils, and aſſociating the Kingdom of his Vertues, to the force of his Armes, broke through all obſtacles, to Crown his inſpired purpoſes? how he in the hurry of War, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Peace, bearing thunder and
<pb facs="tcp:170384:7"/>
olive branches, throughout theſe Kingdomes, now bleſt under your moſt Gracious Protection, has happily rendered himſelf amiable at one time, and terrible at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and yet ever proſperous, and aweful in both?</p>
            <p>No, it is impoſſible for any Mortal to do it, His own Acts onely can ſpeak for him, and for ever will do more, than all the <hi>Panegyricks</hi> in the World can: For the Roſe we know, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently beautified with its leaves, and the Sun with its Rayes, and no more can our praiſes arrive at his perfections, than humane Arts can reach thoſe of Nature.</p>
            <p>But this piece of infinite inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, I ſtand now guilty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Highneſſe, and unleſſe your Gracious Serenity be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to pardon me, I muſt periſh,
<pb facs="tcp:170384:7"/>
even in the Haven of Hope.</p>
            <p>And Mighty Sir, to make ſome ſatisfaction, for my preſent auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious attempt, I will hereafter ſtrive, better to reſemble thoſe devout adorers of the Sun, who not being able to affixe Crowns, and Garlands, upon the head of his Statue, burnt Flowers alwayes in ſacrifice to it, to make their odour mount to the Heavens: So, ſince I can never be able to Crown his deceaſed Highneſſe his Merits, with my weake humane praiſes, I will humbly offer up to Heaven my prayers and vows, for your eternall proſperities, who preſerve ſtill, the <hi>Idaea</hi> of his late Highneſſe his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Majeſty, as well as that of his Sacred Perſon, here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; and that Ile do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly,

            <p>Howſoever, I ſhall now adviſe you, (for your own good, more than mine) for take it how you pleaſe, <hi>I</hi> am indifferent) to ſuſpend at leaſt, ſo much of your partiality, as may otherwiſe offer violence to your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

            <p>In the mean time give me leave, as moſt concerned, to advocate in my own Childs behalf; to obviate ſome, of your objections, that you have bolted out already.</p>

accommodation for thoſe Creatures, if their eyes had been ſet over their hornes. <hi>I</hi> ſhould deſire likewiſe, that theſe our venemous <hi>Momus's,</hi> would ſet their hornes for ſpectacles under their eyes, and try whether they can better ſpy out their excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt our Moſaick Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels.</p>
            <p>The next ſort of enemies that <hi>I</hi> hear this little Infant has encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, are indeed ſomething more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, but as <hi>I</hi> take it, they are, too, a little more nice than wiſe, (as our Proverb hath it) the very method forſooth, of this Diſcourſe, giving great ſcandal to their tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and they are ſo deeply offended at it, that they cry out upon it, phy, a Parallel, or Compariſon with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?</hi> O abominable prophanation! Truly, <hi>I</hi> ſhould be very unwilling to ſcandalize any weake Brother, and
<pb facs="tcp:170384:11"/>
more troubled, not to be able to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his ſcruple, if he pleaſe to be ſatisfied: and certainly, this Piece is not the firſt that has gone that way, we have very ſufficient preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and authority too, to warrant us. Have we not ſeen a compleate Parallel, between <hi>Elias</hi> and Dr. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> even to the Chariots of Iſrael, and the Horſemen thereof? and another betwixt his Succeſſor <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> to the double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſpirit, and many of our Modern Doctors, put in ſcale with ſome of the Apoſtles themſelves? Nor has this way of compariſon, been taken up onely by Divines, in honour of their own Function; but many Parallels we finde in Print, between ſome of our late Kings, how well deſerving, I ſay not; and ſome of thoſe holy Princes, and Prophets of Gods own people, as <hi>David, Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb facs="tcp:170384:11"/>
Joſiah, Hezekiah,</hi> &amp;c. and one very expreſſe Parallel, between Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous Memory, and that great Princeſſe and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe <hi>Deborah.</hi> Then why ſhould not our late incomparable Prince, and Protector ſtand as well placed in line Parallel, with that glorious Patriarch <hi>Moſes</hi>?</p>
            <p>But now I hear of a third expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition prepared againſt us, another body of enemies, much more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but leſſe dangerous far, than the former, and yet they march fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, and come to ſtorme our little Work for a meer counterſcarp of flattery; but they will finde it by their approaches, to be a ſolid Breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of truth, able to endure all their battery, and that too ſo well lined with vertues truely flankerd, and well furniſhed with regular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts, and redoubted truths, that
<pb facs="tcp:170384:12"/>
they muſt be beaten of with loſſe of honour, if not of themſelves.</p>
            <p>There is no man ſure lives, that dare deny the ground-work of all our Moſaical Aſcents, and Staires to Princely perfections, to be the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable dictate of the Spirit of God himſelf: and that all the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our preſent Parallels, are moſt unqueſtionable truths, we have as much certainty, as any humane au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, experimental knowledge, or ocular evidence, can poſſibly make out. Now <hi>I</hi> would fain know, how two ſuch mortal enemies, as truth and flattery are, can poſſibly ſquat in the ſame Form? Beſides, it is certain, that no beatified thing, as our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Moſes</hi> is now without diſpute, can be a ſubject capable of flattery; but let his late Highneſſe be reduced again, to his humane condition, and conſider his due deſervings, then tell
<pb facs="tcp:170384:12"/>
me, whether all our grateful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements, and moſt extended Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyricks, can poſſibly reach his, tranſcendent merits? Much leſſe then ſure can any man over-reach ſo far, as to have his commendations reputed flattery, unleſſe he ſhould fall into prophanation, or flat blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, which I hope the moſt mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious eyes in the World, ſhall never be able to finde out upon us here.</p>
            <p>He was indeed more truly that, which <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaid of his Emperour, <hi>Vir hoc ſaeculo major, &amp; dignus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulantium miraculis vatum, qui tantum ſuper omnes poſterioris aevi Principes emine bat, quantum a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatis caeteri principes receſſerunt</hi>: He was ſo much above the preſent pitch of men, that nothing but <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi> can reach his Actions; and he as far ſurpaſſed all other princes of this later Age as any of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:170384:13"/>
Princes, have out-ſtript private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. What panegyrick then, can be too great for ſuch a prince? what humane praiſe can ever amount to flattery? <hi>I</hi> muſt in the mean time acknowledge ſomething of obligation to this ſort of enemies, who are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to think my poor pen ſo capable to reach that, as to over-reach it ſo, which is a Subject onely fit for the pens of Angels, and whoſe praiſes, ought truly to be written with a ſtile of fire, or point of Adamant, and ſo engraven upon the gates of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Eternity.</p>
            <p>Now though <hi>I</hi> have pretty well, as <hi>I</hi> hope, got my ſelf clear of a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of flattery, yet <hi>I</hi> am now caſt upon another exception of my neareſt friends, whoſe kind pity treats me more rigourouſly, than all the enemies cruelty, and <hi>I</hi> muſt cry out with the Poet, <hi>Pol me occidiſtis amici,</hi> indeed
<pb facs="tcp:170384:13"/>
at once they both pity and perſecute me, for undertaking ſo difficult, if not impoſſible a task, as to carve ſuch an <hi>Illiad</hi> in a Nut-ſhell, or to go about to bind up in ſuch little skins, ſo voluminous an Argument as to give the World an account of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable perſon, from his Cradle, to his Grave, a thing more equal to large Hiſtory, than a Paneygerical one, and of which, as the Evangeliſt tells us, of our Saviours Words and Works, <hi>that the whole World would not be able to contain the Books, that might be written.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed Gentlemen, it will not be denied by any (ſhall be more confeſt by me, though parcel guilty of the ſame crime) that he who ſhall take pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptious pen in hand, or dare any other way undertake, to give the World an exact Survey, of all the particular great diſpenſations, and
<pb facs="tcp:170384:14"/>
Divine indulgencies, vouchſafed to this high Favorite of Heaven, will quickly find himſelf overſet in a Sea of Bliſſe. It is not therefore my Deſign at preſent, to ſail in, much leſſe to fathom, that Abyſs, or deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the whole Series of the Almighty providence, over his moſt precious Perſon, in every particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, from the firſt ſpan that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture meaſured out to him, to that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity, which he afterwards ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily arrived at: it being no leſſe than impoſſible, as the curious in that Art inform us, to poliſh ſo much as the nailes of pieces of ſo great a Perfection. Nor indeed is it more impoſſible than impertinent, to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to prove, that there is, and has been ever, from the firſt minute to the laſt of his life, a moſt gracious and indulgent providence, over his late moſt Serene Highneſſe, his perſon,
<pb facs="tcp:170384:14"/>
and proceedings, by all the ſingular foot-ſteps of it; it being to light a Candle to the Sun, to dilucidate that which is already more clear to all that do not wilfully ſhut their eyes, than if it had been written with the Rayes of it. I ſhall therefore ſatisfie my ſelf, and I hope all ingenuous Readers, at preſent, to pick up ſome of the moſt remarkable particulars, that we may beſt moralize to our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and all impudent gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers, greater confuſion: and that we may learn to make this uſe of it above all uſes, that is to march out of all our old animoſities, and ſubmit our ſelves to the gracious power that is now over us, and acknowledge it to be the clear reſplendent Ray, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon us, from the infallible foundations of the eternall Law.</p>
            <p>This is the uttermoſt of my deſign at preſent, and ſo I will be bold to
<pb facs="tcp:170384:15"/>
begin at the foot of the Moſaick Mount, and ſhew you his late moſt Serene Highneſſe tracing the ſteps of the great Patriarch <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the ſacred ſummity of the Mount it ſelf, and higheſt pitch of all princely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and make good the parallel from their very Births, to their Triumphant entries into their bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Tabernacle of Repoſe, and there to the happy expiration of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Souls upon the top of <hi>Piſgah,</hi> from thence to their glorious Graves, and from thence to the Magnificent Memorials, and Eternal Monuments, which they have erected in the hearts of all men: The Aſcents which theſe two great Perſonages ſtand parallel in, amounting in all to thirty Degrees of Glory.</p>
            <p>So friends farewel, and enemies much good do it you, if you pleaſe, fall to and welcome, if you like it
<pb facs="tcp:170384:15"/>
not you may leave it; and though you curſe me for my cookery, yet I ſhall continue, with the Apoſtle to pray for you, <hi>That the Lord would give you underſtanding in all things,</hi> and me his grace, <hi>in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſtate I am, therewith to be content</hi>; and that we may all meet, <hi>in the unity of the Spirit, and bond of perfectneſſe</hi>; which holy conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy that we may all happily agree in, we muſt all reſolve to lay by all ſpleens and diſtaſts whatſoever, and let them paſſe away with the old year, and think upon nothing now, but to take up new thoughts and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter affections, with this new one coming in: we muſt forget all old grudges againſt, and ungrateful miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſions of our old departed Prince, and good Protector, (who though he was an incomparable Perſon, yet no wonder if he could not pleaſe all men;

for that is more (they ſay) than God himſelf can do, raining, or ſhining) and diſpoſe our ſelves to the cordial and ſincere ſervice of this our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous new one, who is now ſet over us by God, and his own Divine vertues, and has nothing in him but celeſtial ſweetneſſe, and is truly to be called, if ever Mortal was, the Delight of all Mankind; which Great and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious New-Years-Gift, that we may all receive, from the bountiful hands of Heaven, ſhall be the conſtant, as it is the inſtant prayer of,</p>

                  <hi>&amp; primum videri &amp; maximum, in lucem ſtatim foelicem venire.</hi> Nobility of birth, is the firſt and greateſt gift of God. I ſay, the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170384:17"/>
firſt and greateſt temporal diſpenſation of Heaven, is, to be born Noble, and ſo ſoon to be within the liſts of felicity, as of nature; why elſe ſhould we find ſuch an exact account of the Nobility of this our great Prototype <hi>Moſes,</hi> of the three valiant Children, held in the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that of the moſt vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and renowned <hi>Eleazar,</hi> and divers other perſons ſince the univerſal Deluge? which particulars are now too long to be inſiſted on. Nay, that Nobility of blood was in the like eſteem both with God and man too; before the Flood, in the very firſt Age and Infancy of the World, will be quickly made appear, by the delineation of the Genealogy of <hi>Noe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Geneſ. 5.</note> which the holy Spirit is pleaſed to deliver to us, as if it intended, as it were, to act the part of a Herald, in giving to us the large Series of all his Generations: it ſeeming not onely to make way through all the Patriarchs, from whom he was deſcended; but to give a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual rehearſal to us of all their Titles, and Signiories, of all their ſingular Acts and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, and then concludes in the next Chapter, <hi>Hae ſunt generationes</hi> Noe,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 6.</note>

If then Nobility of birth be a bleſſing ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in the eyes of the Lord, and inferr'd by his holy Spirit, to be of no little avail to us in the way of vertue, and an apparent ſtep to Piety and Sanctity it ſelf; It will not be, I hope, thought incongruous, to bring our glorious
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170384:18"/>
ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> to encounter the firſt, upon this his firſt Aſcent; and, as in all the reſt, we ſhall find them ſweetly kiſſing and embracing each the other. And yet I cannot ſay, his late Highneſſe was extracted from ſo Prieſtly a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, but altogether as Princely, being lineally deſcended from the loynes of our moſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Princes, and ty'd in near alliances to the blood of our later Kings, as by that thrice Noble Family of the <hi>Barringtons,</hi> and divers others; which to make a Petigree of, would take up more paper, than we intend for our Volume, and make me appear more a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald, than an Hiſtorian. Nay, indeed, ſhould I but go about to prove, his Highneſſe moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Houſe Noble, I ſhould commit a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Temple of Honour, and onely violate his moſt glorious Family, with a more ſolemn infamy.</p>
               <p>His Highneſſe is unqueſtionably known to have deſcended from ſuch a ſtem of Princely Anteceſſors, that whole Ages, which waſt Rocks, and wear out Elements, have never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to leſſen, but rather advance the honour of his great Houſe. He was derived from ſuch a Family, that we may better ſay of it, than what was of the other, <hi>ex qua neſcit aliquid Mediocre naſci,</hi> from whence nothing ordinary can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; as is likewiſe made notoriouſly evident, in thoſe other moſteminent perſons of Honour, now living, who are bleſt with a ſhare of his incomparable blood: who have ſpread their glory abroad, ſo well as at home, and built

               <p>And that I may not be thought to flatter ſo great a truth, I will be bold to haſten, and abruptly conclude this firſt point of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Parallel; with ſaying onely, that this ſublime Perſon, his late moſt Serene High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, our ſecond, as the firſt great <hi>Moſes,</hi> came into the World, like a Princely Pearl, and made it appear, by the quality of his <hi>Orient,</hi> that if Nature pleaſed to equal his birth, to the beſt of Noble-men upon Earth, he would equal his vertues to his extraction; as we ſhall ſee more plainly, when we mount a little higher, upon our Moſaical Aſcents, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels.</p>

               <hi>MOſes</hi> was from his Cradle bleſt with a very beautiful body,<note place="margin">Exod. 2.2.</note> for which he was moſt remarkable, in his infancy, ſo the ſacred text tells us, that he was a fair and goodly child.

Does not the Lord himſelf proclaim, as he is the God of Nature, that beauty and graceful comlineſſe of body is entirely his gift? Nay, ha's he not often imployed this his own glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpenſation, to be an inſtrument of his mighty wonders, a lightning flaſh of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and as a reſplendent Torch of his greateſt Victories? which his All-Wiſe Providence would never have done, did he not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the nature of, but intend to give the greateſt honour to,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that his own diſpenſation.

               <p>We have ſeen in our <hi>Aſcent</hi> the beauty of our <hi>Moſes,</hi> and divers other perſons, beſides that of our Saviours, celebrated in holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; and truly, I muſt be bold to adde; not without a great deal of reaſon; for, the more admirable ſure the piece of workmanſhip is, when it duely examines and contemplates it ſelf, ought more to incite a man, and raiſe him to a higher love, and greater praiſe of the workman, which is (if the word may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned) God himſelf, and he that has the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt preparation, in his bodily Fabrick or Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; reaſon juſtly requires of him, that he ſhould order his manners proportionably, and, according to the perfection of his ſoul, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make her appear more fair, being lodged in ſo compleat and well-proportion'd a body: And they that ſhall abuſe this fair and ineſtimable gift of Heaven, to any impious, fond, carnal prophanation, by devoting that, and themſelves to any ſenſual, ſordid, bruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh life, do plainly drag the gift of heaven, and Divinity it ſelf in the duſt. Nay, they are
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170384:21"/>
guilty of a more barbarous ingratitude, than they that ſteal Silver and Gold from the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, to make Altars to <hi>Baal</hi> or <hi>Aſhteroth</hi>; or, that light their Lamps at the Altar-fire of the Omnipotent, to make pillage afterwards of his Temple; or, that take bread from the Maſter of the houſe with one hand, and ſtabb him with the other.</p>
               <p>Well then, it may be granted, that a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and well proportioned body, is an indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable gift of God, and that the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it ordinarily, upon his deareſt Saints and Servants.

As to the former, we find by many ancient Pens, as well as Penſils, <hi>Moſes</hi> drawn forth to us, with a goodly, large, and illuſtrious countenance, a cheerful, fair, and exporrected forehead, (ſuch a one, as <hi>Juſtinian</hi> wiſht his greateſt Judges and Generals to have) a ſevere, but graceful Aſpect; a gallant, no gigantick ſtature, a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtious, yet well proportioned body, and in the carriage, as well as ſhape, of every limb, a gracious and moſt becoming Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Now I appeal again to all but blind men, or malitious, whether this, be not his late High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe Picture too?

but a prerogative planted in the forehead, which conſiſts in looks and geſtures, and (as <hi>Maxim.

And this again conſiſts in a comely largeneſſe, in proportion of members, in apt lineaments, in colour, moiſture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This dignity of Princely beauty, is deformed, by any over-curioſity of tricking, or taking any thing out of the box, or borrowing too much from Barber or Looking-glaſſe, all that, is below a man.</p>
               <p>Let any, again, but his Highneſſe's moſt malitious enemies, ſay, whether this was not the late Protectors very Picture, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter too?

            <p>Lo, here we find a little Infant, our great <hi>Moſes,</hi> expoſed to the mercy of <hi>Nilus,</hi> in a ſtrange bottome, a boat made of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſhes,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> or floating Cradle of Reeds. The poor tender Mother is wholly become heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and abandoneth her Childe to death, to ſave him from the Savage cruelty of men, ſet on work, to deſtroy innocents, by the direful rigour of a ſterne Tyrant. The Aunt, not altogether ſo hopeleſſe, but a little bolder, dares to follow the forlorne Infant, at ſome diſtance, ſo as to keep it within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of her eye, endeavouring to ſee (if ſhe could) what would become of the Child; but her weakneſſe, alas, could do nothing to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170384:24"/>
him from the imminent danger: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, in the mean ſpace, is pleaſed to become the Pilot of this little Barke; he beares it upon the waves, and conducts it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sails, without Rudder, without Oares, or any other help, of ſtream or tyde, beſides that, of his own eternal, and immenſe goodneſs, and ſo makes it arrive, beyond all humane ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, in a moſt happy Haven, and there to diſcharge its lading in the arms of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, with ſafety and comfort: A Royal Harbour for ſuch a poor weather-beaten boat, after ſo perilous a paſſage.</p>
            <p>Now the little Infant is drawn forth by the pity of the Tyrants Daughter, and he who was expoſed as a victim to <hi>Pharaohs</hi> cruelty, muſt be thus, by the Tyrants own Daughter, (his own fleſh and blood) preſerved to be a God of <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> and to live to bury them, or their poſterity, in the bottom of the Red Sea,<note place="margin">Exod. 4.16.</note> who would have drown'd him in his infancy, in the River <hi>Nilus.</hi>

               <p>I take it for a verity unqueſtionable, that great ſpirits ſet apart and pre-ordained by Divine Providence, for the performance of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wonders, have moſt particular tutelar An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels aſſigned to them for their protection, from their very infancy; and thoſe very perſons, from their Cradles, are frequently pointed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170384:25"/>
out to us, by the finger of God himſelf, in their moſt miraculous preſervations. So we ſee in Hiſtories, how the little King <hi>Mithridates,</hi> (that was to prove one of the greateſt, and moſt puiſſant Monarchs of the whole Earth) being involved in lightning flaſhes, whilſt he innocently ſlept in his infant-cradle, the flames conſuming his very ſwadling-cloaths and linnens, yet he remained untoucht in his body.</p>
               <p>In like manner, we finde another Prodigy of Divine providence, ſo loudly proclaimed in the Greek <hi>Anthology,</hi> how a father and an innocent ſon, were equally ſurprized with a ſad ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, which took away the life of the father, and gave the ſon leave to arrive in a ſafe Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, having no other veſſel or plank to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him aſhore, but the very corps of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed father, who ſo afforded him a ſecond life by his death: and this very child thus wonderfully delivered, grew up to be one of the braveſt men in <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot paſſe by one other effect of Divine providence, no leſſe ſtupendious than the former, that fell out not long ſince in the Country of <hi>Apulia,</hi> where happened an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, the laſt day of <hi>July</hi> 1627. and ſo prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a one, that (as I have heard, and ſeen writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) in the City of St. <hi>Severin</hi> alone, more than ten thouſand ſouls, were taken out of the World; and yet in the horror of ſuch infinite ruines, and ſepulchre of ſo many mortals, a great Bell fell ſo fitly over a little child, that it
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170384:25"/>
not onely did him no hurt, but miraculouſly incloſing him, made it ſelf a Bulwark and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence for him againſt the danger of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ruines: and this Child is now grown up (as I am informed) to be one of the moſt conſiderable perſons in all <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus little <hi>Romulus,</hi> like our Infant <hi>Moſes,</hi> being expoſed to the ſame mercileſſe element, was moſt ſtrangely preſerved to be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the greateſt City, Monarchy, State, and Empire, of the univerſal World. I ſhould be infinite if I ſhould run through the whole Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſacred Providence, in the particular miraculous preſervations, that have been ſhewed upon ſuch principal perſons, from their very infancies. Yet, truly, if there were no other inſtances of Divine providence left us, but onely theſe two, of our firſt and ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> we needed not alledge more arguments to prove the ſingular care, the Lord takes over the perſons of good Princes.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen on the one ſide, a little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant floating on the waters of <hi>Nilus,</hi> in a cradle built of Bulruſhes, and lying juſt like a worm hidden in ſtraw, and whoſe afflicted friends, meaſured his Tombe with their eyes, in every billow of that faithleſſe element; yet was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved at length from danger, by the very blood of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to turn his Diadem into duſt, and to bury him and his whole army, in the dreadful gulph of the Red Sea.</p>
               <p>They that have ſeen his late Highneſſe, our ſacred ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the like former immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170384:26"/>
perills, and the great actions he has ſince, moſt gloriouſly arrived at, can beſt make a Parallel of the Providence. No Nurſe or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mother whatſoever, could be half ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to drive a fly from the face of her little Infant, whilſt it ſlept, as the Providence of our gracious Lord, has ever ſhewed its ſelf affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate, in the conſervation of his Highneſſe his moſt elevated ſoul: and, though I cannot ſay he was expoſed upon, yet, as I have heard, he has been in equal dangers, by, the water, as his firſt Matter <hi>Moſes</hi> was: and a great deal more by fire; tumbling from Precipices, falls from Coaches, Horſes, and Houſes too, and what not? inſomuch that it is ſaid, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency of thoſe his Infant dangers, has ſtruck the very hearts, and chil'd the blood, in the veins, of all beholders.</p>
               <p>Thus then we ſee a very parallel provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, over theſe two great perſons, their very Cradles kiſſing, and, as it were, conſpiring to rock each other: and truly, not without a great deal of reaſon, that they ſhould run pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel in their childhood-deliverances, (as we have ſeen) who were in their riper years, to ſerve equally, as inſpired inſtruments of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wonders: and all the World, methinkes, if it had not been wilfully blind, muſt needs have diſcerned, in his Highneſſe his Infancy, that he was then, pointed out, by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Providence, to be the ſame perſon, which he has ſince, ſo gloriouſly approved himſelf to be. Thoſe who had the honour to

be trained up, as other <hi>Hebrew</hi> children were, in fear, and bondage, which often overwhelm the braveſt diſpoſitions; but brought him to the Court of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> cauſed him to be nouriſhed in all the exerciſes of Nobility, and to ſwallow all the learning of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who then had the reputation of the wiſeſt, and the knowingeſt men of the whole World.</p>

but the very Fountain of all our Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

               <p>We have hitherto convers't, in the Moſaical out-works onely, and ſeen theſe two high Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourits of Heaven, our firſt and ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> marching hand in hand together, in moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micable Parallel, through ſome remarkable Aſcents of their Infancy: We are now hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily

entering into the Inner <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect ſomething upon the diſpoſitions of their Adoleſcency, which there is no doubt, but we ſhall find, very agreeable to their Births. And, indeed, one of the greateſt benefits, which youth can receive at the hands of God, is the favourable bleſſing of a good education; it is that, which poliſheth and purifieth humane Nature, as one would do a precious Stone, obſcured with earth, or baſe ordure; it is that, which as a late Doctor tells us, makes of men, (as it were) Angels: and, without it, doubtleſſe the goodlieſt, and moſt precious natures, would perpetually dwell in a ſad brutiſhneſſe: But above all others, Princes ought to have an extraordinary advantage of Learning; for it is highly neceſſary, ſure, that their ſouls ſhould be fulleſt of lights, and flames, which are to ſerve others, for ſo great guides, and to be moſt exquiſitly adorned with good letters, who know (as doubtleſſe our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Moſes</hi> did, from his Cradle) that they are to be ſet aloft upon pinacles, to change their words into Laws, and lives into exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. And he that was to be Supream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of ſo many Nations, ought, ſure, with inceſſant ſtudy, read, unite, and incorperate in his ſole ſelf, the vertues, and faculties of many others. And ſo our glorious ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> did, who was no leſſe remarkable, for his true Liberal, Noble, &amp; Princely education, than the former. And, truly, for this we muſt acknowledge eternal obligations to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170384:29"/>
his moſt honourable Parents, who had a principal care, to perfect the natural endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Child, with thoſe of Art; to the ſhame of many fathers, and mothers, at this day, who too much reſemble Oſtriches, who lay their eggs in the open way, without hatching them, abandoning their children to become a prey to miſery, ignorance, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety: But his Highneſſe, moſt illuſtrious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, deſirous to live in the honour, of their incomparable Child, and to give him a breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equal to his Nobility, Beauty, and Ingeny, and to thoſe miraculous preſervations, by which he was pointed out by Providence, to be a future Inſtrument of Divine wonders, as the former <hi>Moſes</hi> was, would give him an edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation equal to his. And it is notorious, that he ſuckt in, a very great proportion of Philoſophy, with the firſt milk, that he drew from his Mother Univerſity; as alſo, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured many other Pieces of prophane learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which, may be, were ſupererrogatory in a Prince; yet, by that means, he merited to be then as much thought the glory of the Gown, as he has ſince, prov'd himſelf the honour of the Sword; for, he attained to ſo ſtupendious a pitch of Learning, in ſo few years, that all that knew him then, thought it rather came, (which was ſuſpected upon the former <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> too) by inſpiration, than acquiſition: and who could then but admire, thoſe fair bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes, of which we have ſeen ſince, ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent fruits, Nor can there be leſſe doubt

of his perfection in Political knowledge, made by any man, that will but look upon his moſt Serene Highneſſe, his Government, either Civil, or Military, over us, or the Laws that he has eſtabliſht, for the eternal ſafety, and comfort, of theſe Nations. And, as for Divinity, I mean, that of the heart, that Grand Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Piece, and moſt principal part of Royal Learning, we all know, that was bred and born with him: a Divinity, I ſay, not lodg'd in the Schools, that is too knotty ſure for Princes heads; but that which is repoſed in godly hearts, and that is the true fear of the Lord, which is acknowledged by Scripture it ſelf, to be the beginning of all Wiſdom: and, though we dare not aſſert, for it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, what perſonal diſcourſes he has had with the Almighty, yet we may affirm, that all his inſpirations were Divine; and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation was ever ſo celeſtical, as if he lay, in the very boſome of the Deity. Upon the whole, then, as his firſt Maſter <hi>Moſes,</hi> was bred up in all the Learning of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> ſo was his moſt Serene Highneſſe, diſpoſed to conſecrate his hopeful youth, to the ſtudy of the Arts, in one of our Univerſities; wherein he came to ſo much perfection, that he was pleaſed do deſcend to a degree, by which he made that, more than himſelf, Laureat, for ſo he was without it. Then, that the other moſt famous Siſter, ſhould not be dejected, he was pleaſed to crown her, with the acceptance of her higheſt degree of Honour, and to lay a further

obligation upon her, and the whole Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Learning, he has been pleaſed ſince to own himſelf, her Patron, Chancellor, and moſt particular Protector; and ſince his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe his greater occaſions, have hindered his attendance on that Charge, he has yet added to her obligations, by bequeathing that care, to his moſt excellent ſon, and Princely Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, his now moſt Serene Highneſſe, whom we may ſo juſtly entitle to be, <hi>Chara Dei ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles, magnum Jovis Incrementum</hi>: and can no more doubt that he will trace the ſteps of his renowned father, than he, our ſecond, has ſhewed himſelf to be a perfect imitator of his great Maſter the firſt <hi>Moſes</hi>; as we ſhall ſtill find his Highneſſe, mounting after him, in the ſucceeding Aſcents.</p>

               <hi>MOſes</hi> lived a long retired life in his youth, contemning the pomp and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, and all the World beſides: chooſing rather to paſſe as a private Shepherd in a Deſert, and to keep his father in Law <hi>Jethro</hi>'s Flocks,<note place="margin">Exod. 3.</note> than to be made a Companion of Kings. Now, here I muſt be bold to aſſert, that none but high bred, as well as high born, ſouls, are capable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, much leſſe of undergoing, ſuch a bleſſed ſolitude, as this our old Maſter <hi>Moſes</hi> did. In this he ſhewed himſelf, to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the very higheſt pitch of Philoſophy, and all Learning, in ſo diſcreet a contempt of all the profits, pleaſures, glories, and vanities, of the World.</p>
            <p>Here, then, behold, and admire, (all you pittiful plaiſtered Puppits of the World) this grand Maſter of Honour, and Learning, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>; who, though enriched, with all the fair perfections of mind, and body, requiſite to the accompliſhment of a Courtier, could not be brought, by all the powerful allurements of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter; no, nor yet by the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations, of his poor brethren, then in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170384:31"/>
who ſtood in no little need, (God knows) of ſuch a helper, lying then, under a moſt Tyrannical oppreſſion: or, could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, to accept the charge, of any publick employments; but, choſe rather for a great while, to retire himſelf, and to live a free, and harmleſſe Shephered, in a Deſert, than to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil his celeſtial ſoul, in any mundane mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or to idolize his ſinful captivity, in a Court.</p>
            <p>This is the higheſt point of Philoſophy in the World, for a man, eſpecially in his youth, to know how to make himſelf his own, to ſet light by, and trample under-foot, all that is without him; to look on all the pomps, and pleaſures, of this World, as the old <hi>Egyptians</hi> did, upon thoſe dangerous theeves, whom they then termed <hi>Philiſtas,</hi> that were wont to tickle, fawn upon, and embrace, whom they had a purpoſe to ſtrangle. And truly, if the headach, ſhould ſeize upon us, before drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſſe, we ſhould all beware of too much drinking; but ſordid ſenſuality, the better to entrap us, makes her apparent pleaſures, to march ſtill before us, and hides perpetualy, her too rugged, and repentant track from us. If we can arrive at ſo happy a knowledge, as to ſee into thoſe miſerable conſequences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand, it muſt be onely, by the pure help of Philoſophy, or the immediate grace of God. And this was that, which our Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſee, and accordingly practice; not making, neither, ſuch a ſad, and vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory

retreat, as ſome Princes, and great Perſons have done, to quit, and forſake the World, when either they have been weary of it, or that has been of them: but a true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical retreat, a retreat of improvement, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, to bring us on afterwards (as at a jump) with greater advantage, a retreat to cultivate, and enrich a ſoul: This was that, I ſay, our <hi>Moſes</hi> did, who, when he had devoured all the learning of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> he would retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a while, to diſgeſt it in the Land of <hi>Midian:</hi> when he had ſuckt in all the ſeeds of good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature from the Schools, he withdrew a while, to improve the growth of them in the fields; ſo avoiding all commixture of weeds, which many times, does ſtrangle the beſt and moſt ſublime parts in men: And, to conclude all this, our great Maſter <hi>Moſes,</hi> choſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void all thoſe peſtilences, that uſually attend upon Courts, and moſt Companies, to go to fructify in the Deſert.</p>

               <p>As firſt, to a former <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> God ſent a dream, (which <hi>Joſeph</hi> afterwards interpreted)

by which the King prevented his own ruine, and the deſtruction of his people, by a diſmal dearth.

So by this means, he won the day, and the world together, and became the ſole peaceable Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of the Roman Empire; that under his Reign, our Prince of Peace, and Glorious Redeemer, ſhould be born, as he was.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:170384:35"/>Now, God forbid, that we ſhould think the Almighty Providence leſſe ſolicitous, over the perſons of Chriſtian Princes, and their pious proceedings: no, he has, abundantly ſhewed, that no Mother, or Nurſe, had ſo much tender affection, and care over their ſucklings, as his goodneſſe has ſhewed it ſelf careful in their pre-cautions and admonitions of dangers, and moſt frequent conſervations, which all Chriſtian Hiſtories are full of: But indeed, we need go no further, than to the Hiſtories of the holy War, written by <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> and <hi>Gulielmus Tyrius,</hi> how often he has vouchſafed miſſions of Angels, and alſo holy Dreams, and Viſions, to direct thoſe pious Princes. Nay, the Lord kept the very birds of the air, in pay under <hi>Godfry</hi> of <hi>Bouil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>; for who can be but aſtoniſht, to hear it told, how, when he beſieged <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Sultan having taught pigeons, to carry meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, diſpatched one of them with a Letter, which ſhe bore under her wings, to give ſome advice to the beſieged; but Providence would have it, that a Hawk ſeizing on her, juſt over the Chriſtian Army, took her, and made her bring her information to the Chriſtians, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the enemies deſign. But as for Dreams, the three laſt <hi>Harry</hi>'s of <hi>France,</hi> are undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly the greateſt examples, who all were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely admoniſht of their approaching dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death, by their Queens, and other Princes of their blood; but they with over-confidence would run on heedleſſe, and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170384:36"/>
to their own deſtruction. Nay, the middlemoſt of the three, beſides the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, he receiv'd from the Dreams of others, ſaw himſelf, in a Dream, how all his Royal ornaments, <hi>viz.</hi> his Linnen Veſture, Sandalls, Dalmatian Robe, Mantle of Azure Sattin, the great and leſſer Crowns, Scepter, and hand of Juſtice, Sword, and Guilt-Spurs, all bloody, and fouled with peoples feet, and that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was very angry with the Sexton of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> about it; and though he wanted not good counſel, according to the danger of his Dream, to ſtand ſecurely upon his guard, and make uſe of the fair pre-monition of heaven; yet would, forſooth, out of his gallantry, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his perſon to the malice of thoſe, who kept a fatal blow in ſtore for him.</p>
               <p>I cannot ſtand here to diſpute with the learned <hi>Volaterranus,</hi> whether all men in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, going to Bed, not cloy'd with bad affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, nor any ſuperfluities of meat or drink, but being throughout vertuouſly and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſpoſed, their ſouls in ſleeping, may not foreſee things to come: for I muſt haſten to accompliſh our Parallel: and it is indeed, as much as concerns our preſent purpoſe, to ſay, that we are very certainly ſure, of ſo much, (as by ſome inſtances has been ſhewed alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and might be by many more) that the Dreams of Kings, and Princes, Prophets, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of Armies, Magiſtrates, and all Publick Perſons, that hold any Eminent Degree, either in Church, or State, are commonly propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170384:36"/>
and monitory, of things to come, or to be done: This I ſay, by grace eſpecial and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, not Natural, as may more plainly appear in this our precious Parallel. And indeed, to ſay, that our moſt gracious Lord, had not an equal care, of his late ſacred Highneſſe, our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> as he had of the former, of an <hi>Alexander,</hi> a <hi>Julius,</hi> or <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> (who was to be as glorious in his Victories, and a greater Inſtrument of Divine wonders, than any, except this his happy Parallel,) would be an infidelity greater as theirs, that oppugne Divine Providence it ſelf.</p>
               <p>I dare not yet boldly affirm, that our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> in his retirement, met with any flaming Buſh, and the Lord ſpeaking to him out of it; or that he has had any ſuch perſonal diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, with the Almighty: if his late Highneſſe has had any of thoſe, they were onely then known, as I believe, to the Lord, and to his own ſacred ſelf. But this I have moſt certainly been informed, that his Highneſſe had many Revelations, and Divine Dreams, to the ſame purpoſe, admoniſhing him, what he ſhould do, and foretelling him what he ſhould arrive at: which that I may not prejudice, by my rude relation, I hold better to paſſe by with ſilence, till ſome that his moſt Serene Highneſſe was pleaſed to make knowing of them, ſhall do the World the favour, as to make the diſcovery. But ſo much is notorious to all theſe Nations, that as our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> was retired like the former, and near the backſide of the Deſert
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170384:37"/>
too, but ſtill near the Mountain of God: the Lord found him out there, and called him; for who can hide, what the Lord will bring to light? <hi>Sed quis te Cyllarus, aut Arion poſſet cripere, quem ſequebatur imperium?</hi> as was moſt excellently ſaid by <hi>Eumenius.</hi> What Horſe or Dolphin is ſo ſwift, that can ſteal from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal eyes, a perſon whom the Providence of God purſueth with Empire in hand? A burning, and a ſpeaking Buſh, muſt call the firſt <hi>Moſes</hi> from his retirement, to deliver and conduct his brethren out of bondage; and no leſſe, I am ſure, than three Kingdoms all in a flame, with the united cries of ſo many millions, and in them too, the voice of God, for ſo is <hi>vox populi,</hi> could move our incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable late Protector, to ingulph himſelf, in the Ocean of Publick imployment. We have ſeen, that extraordinary Perſons, muſt have extraordinary Calls, and our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> his firſt Call, from his dear, divine ſolitude, was a publick Parliamentary Call, and there too, when he was moſt violently perſwaded to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; how long was it, before he could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his moſt ſetled and ſerene Soul, to be capable of the ſollicitudes of State? but for divers years ſate in Parliament, and Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, upon all the Common-wealths occaſions, as the Birds of <hi>Baruch,</hi> upon white thorns, and as the Gyants of holy <hi>Job,</hi> before ſpoken of, which mourn'd under the waters: and this we ſhall ſee more plainly appear, in the proceſſe of our ſucceeding Aſcents, and Parallels.</p>

               <hi>MOſes</hi> being in his own judgement, and in all outward appearance, unfit for ſo great a Charge, was very unwillingly perſwaded by God, to undertake it; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,<note place="margin">Exod. 3.11.</note> as it came to a very high expoſtulation between them. Was there ever ſuch a diſpute with the Almighty? Or was there ever ſeen ſuch a difficulty in man, to be perſwaded to ſo high a point of preferment? Behold what arguments he raiſeth againſt the Lord, and his own ſelf. And his firſt refuſal ſeems to proceed, from a vice of over-modeſty; for the ſacred Text tells us, That <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid unto God, <hi>Who am I, that I ſhould go unto</hi> Pharaoh,<note place="margin">Ibid v. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and that I ſhould bring the children of Iſrael out of Egypt?</hi> which the Lord was pleaſed gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly to anſwer, and ſatisfie with an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that he world be with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then he proceeds to ſomething of a double diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; firſt objecting, <hi>Behold when I come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the children of Iſrael, and ſhall ſay unto them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 13.</note> 
               <hi>the God of your fathers hath ſent me unto you, and they ſhall ſay unto me, What is his name? What ſhall I ſay unto them?</hi> To which the Lord
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170384:38"/>

               <hi>I am that I am,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to ſay, to the children of Iſrael, that <hi>I am</hi> had ſent him unto them, and ſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht him with a large Commiſſion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. But yet our <hi>Moſes</hi> will be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtill of the force and effect of his Almighty Commiſſion; for he anſwered and ſaid, <hi>But behold they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice</hi>;<note place="margin">Exod. 4.1.</note> 
               <hi>for they will ſay, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee.</hi> Now this redoubled doubt, and diffidence of poor <hi>Moſes,</hi> the moſt gracious Lord pleaſed to reform with two ſtupendious miracles, and ſo to frighten him into a better obedience:<note place="margin">V. 2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.</note> Firſt with his own Rod turned into a Serpent, and returned into a Rod again; and then with his own hand, made Leprous, and whole again, all in a moment; ſo drawing, as it were, its contagion, and cure from his own boſome. Nay, further, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his faith, and credit his Commiſſion, with the children of Iſrael, the Lord aſſures him, that he ſhall have the power to turn the water of the River into blood upon the dry Land.</p>
            <p>Now after all this, was it poſſible that there ſhould be any more evaſion found out, by our too modeſt <hi>Moſes</hi>? Yes ſurely, and to ſomething ſavouring of a very high infidelity: For <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> replied unto the Lord, <hi>O my Lord, I am not eloquent,</hi>

the benignity of our gracious God, who is pleaſed ſtill to confute him, without any take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of offence: onely asking him the queſtion,<note place="margin">V. 11.12.</note> 
               <hi>Who made mans mouth, or who maketh the dumb or the deaf, or the ſeeing, or the blind? Have not I the Lord?</hi> then aſſuring him, that he will be with his mouth, and teach him what he ſhall ſay. What could be expected after this, but a ready aſſent? yet inſtead of that, behold he flies out to a flat denial; to all this over-modeſty, diffidence, and almoſt infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he will yet adde obſtinacy, and a diſmal diſobedience, as ever was heard of, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bid the Lord ſend whom he would.<note place="margin">13.</note> Then the anger of the Lord was kindled againſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>; yet ſo mercifully, as to be pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile himſelf to him inſtantly again, and by further aſſurances of his Almighty favours, with the promiſed aſſiſtencie of his brother <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſo to convince his doubting ſervant,<note place="margin">14.</note> and to convert him to a more reſolute faith, and active obedience.</p>
            <p>Thus then, the buſineſſe now ſtands agreed on, our poor, modeſt, diffident, and fearful, <hi>Moſes,</hi> is now become a faithful, and a ſtout one; and the Lord who full well knew before, his capacities to diſcharge, is now pleaſed to pardon his long unwillingneſſe to perform, his ſo great, and weighty Commands.</p>

               <head>The Parallel.</head>
               <p>Now truly our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> cannot appear leſſe Parallel to the firſt, in this his unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to accept of all publick Charges, than he has done in all his accompliſhments of parts, or any of the paſt Aſcents. And yet this unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs of his, never proceeded from any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of, or diſobedience to, any Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which was indeed, the fault of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Moſes</hi>: but partly from his own humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, over-modeſty, and high contempt of all earthly things. His ſanctified ſpirit lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all thoſe flattering flouriſhes, of this worlds greatneſſe, no otherwiſe, than as the true gardens of <hi>Adonis,</hi> which in the beginning make a fair ſhew of ſome ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly flowers, but in concluſion, afford nothing but thorns. He alwayes reckoned, that the Careers of the greateſt honours here below, were but of ice, and moſt commonly bounded with headlong ruins. He found in his younger judgement, as we have ſeen, (though certainly it was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired piece of prudence) that all the pitiful felicities of this life, were onely floating Iſlands, which recoil backwards, when a man thinks for to touch them, with his fingers; or as the Feaſts of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> where were fair invitations, many reverences, and many ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; but in the end, nothing but a Table
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170384:39"/>
appears, ſet out with a Banquet made of wax, which melts before the fire, and from whence a man muſt return, more hungry than he came: Or yet, more like the inchanted egg of <hi>Oromazes,</hi> wherein the impudent Magician, boaſted to have incloſed all the happineſſe of the Univerſe; but when it was opened, there was found, nothing but wind.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the ſolitary conſiderations that moved his late moſt Serene Highneſſe, to his ſo long and cloſe concealment of himſelf. And indeed, the heavenly Providence over this great Perſon, (if we look well throughout him) can never be otherwiſe read, then (as let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters written with the juice of Limon) by the help of fire, or flame of a burning Buſh, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which muſt not onely flame neither, but muſt conſume even to his own door, may be ready to involve all in a general conflagration, before he would at all think himſelf to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, or buſily beſtirre himſelf to quench it: or before he would undertake (the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy neceſſities of State then requiring a war) any part of his incomparable Moſaical conduct. So that we may at laſt affirm, and conclude of him, as <hi>Claudian</hi> does of his brave Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> that <hi>Solus meruit regnare rogatus,</hi> there is none worthy of a Crown, but he that muſt be importun'd to it.</p>
               <p>Now ſome we know there have been, that have had an moſt enraged deſire to Empire, and yet would feign themſelves to have all the averſions in the world againſt it; and ſo have
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170384:40"/>
cauſed themſelves, to be carryed to their Thrones, like unwilling beaſts to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The truth of it is, the heart of man, as the Scripture tells us, is inſcrutable above all things, and more eſpecially ſo, in point of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; and I have often conſidered thoſe three difficult queſtions which the Angel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>Eſdras,</hi> to weigh the fire, to meaſure the wind, and to number the veins of the Abyſs, and really I find, the intricacy of an exorbitant ambition, to be all that. Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a devouring fire, who can poiſe it? It is a moſt robuſtious violent wind, who can hold, or fathom it? It is a bottomleſſe Abyſs, who can count the iſſues, and the ſources of it? The middle of the Earth, hath been found, the depth of the Sea hath been ſounded, the height of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and <hi>Riphaean</hi> Hills, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves has be taken, and meaſured, the remot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt limits of the hollow caverns of <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> have been dived into; the head-ſpring of <hi>Nilus</hi> it ſelf, hath not eſcaped the diſcovery: onely, in the hearts of men, we cannot find the bounds of deſire of commanding.</p>
               <p>This (I ſay) is too true, in the community of men; but his Moſaical Highneſſe, has ever given ſuch viſible and apparent proofes, of his divine ſelf-denying ſpirit, and ſuch irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble arguments, of his reall reluctancies, againſt all offers whatſoever, of wordly greatneſſe, that malice it ſelf, cannot object, the leaſt ſpot of ambition to have poſſeſt his inſpired boſom. For firſt, we have ſeen, how long he was pleaſed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170384:40"/>
to conceal himſelf, like his dear Maſter <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the backſide of the Deſart, near to the Mountain of God, where he could have no converſation, but with him, and his own ſoul; and we all know how unwilling he was, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake that his beloved humble retreat, which ſure he had never done, if he had not ſtudied moſt thoroughly the beſt of Poets, ſo often repeated, <hi>Sic vos, non vobis</hi>: and been more divinely taught, that all which is moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in creatures, is not for the creatures, which poſſeſſe it; as light is not in the Sun, for the Sun it ſelf, nor waters are in the Ocean, for the Ocean it ſelf. The great God of the Univerſe, who gave Brightneſſe to the one, and Rivers to the other, would, that both ſhould tend to the publick commodity of men, and has thereby ordained them, to paſſe on to the glory of the Soveraign Being.</p>
               <p>His inſpired Highneſſe, full well knew, that Kingdoms were not made ſo much for Kings, as Kings for their Kingdoms; for they are made ſo, and ſet over them, to this end onely, to do them, not themſelves, good, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them, and preſerve them, as the goods of God himſelf. His Highneſſe likewiſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that ſo ſoon as a man is born with, and bred up to, fair and worthy parts, he is to employ himſelf, and them, for the publick good; and he who would retain to himſelf, what Divine Providence gave in common, commits a ſacriledge in the great Temple of the God of Nature; and he that perpetually
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170384:41"/>
reflects on himſelf in all things, and draws, as it were, all to himſelf, as if he were ſo made, onely for himſelf, oppoſeth his Creator, and Judge, and makes himſelf corrival with the Soveraign Majeſty of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Now after that our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> had, upon theſe Divine conſiderations, been drawn to put himſelf forth upon publick Services, we all know, how unwilling he has been to receive the dues of his own honours, and how deſirous he was rather to wrap himſelf up, nay, to bury himſelf, if he could have done it, in his firſt colours, than to proceed to higher Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which being ſtill enforced upon him by his own Moſaical merits, we have ſeen likewiſe with what humility, and great candor of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he has ever managed them. And when the preſſing neceſſities of State required, that one ſingle perſon ſhould ſit at the Helme, and that he was pointed out, both by God and man, for that purpoſe; how unwilling was he to accept the Charge? inſomuch, that when the Protector at of theſe Nations, was ſo violently preſſed upon him, by the then wearied Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; who knows not, with what ſighs, and groans, not to be uttered, and ſad regrets, leſſe to be underſtood, he was at length plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to undergo the Charge? Nay, yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Is it not moſt evident, how to his very laſt day, he has with an incomparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and magnanimity of ſpirit, refuſed and reſiſted, all thoſe urgent importunities of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and People, Council, and Army,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170384:41"/>
preſſing the Crown, and the Title of King upon him? And in all this, has he not moſt perfectly proved himſelf, the follower of his pattern, and great Maſter <hi>Moſes?</hi> who was not onely unwilling to receive the honour of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain General over his Brethren, but refuſed and contemned the whole Court, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus our bleſſed Saviour, the Pattern of all patterns, to convince the World, that he was the Example of all perfection, would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear onely great in refuſing of a whole world, which the Devil did, as it were, unfold to him, before his feet. So, doubtleſſe, it was his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will likewiſe, that the vertue of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt men, ſhould appear clearly in the refuſal of the greateſt honours, when as, by his Spirit, the bleſſed <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> refuſed the greateſt of all Titles, which was to own the high honour, and name of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> Indeed, it is a moſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular grace, and favour afforded by God; to make a man to open his eyes upon himſelf, to know himſelf as he ought, to meaſure himſelf, and to ſet limits upon his own deſires.</p>
               <p>Now this eſpecial grace, we ſee the Lord has largely beſtowed upon theſe his two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Servants, our firſt and ſecond <hi>Moſes.</hi> And indeed, my Lord alwayes lookt upon thoſe ſpirits with pity, who outragiouſly mad after greatneſſe, purſue it with all manner of toil, and ſiniſter practices, and never coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to be otherwiſe, than as bubbles, that riſe on the water in the time of a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170384:42"/>
which both encreaſe, and crack in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That wretched ſordid ambition it was, which made the great Roman Emperours of old, to ſit ſo ſlippery upon their Thrones, and to live, indeed, but the age of flowers, ſtill driving one another out, as nailes do; or as the waves that are ſtill beating one another, to be broken againſt Rocks. No, our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> like the firſt, was ever ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to ſo high a pitch of Holy, and Divine contemplations, that he lookt upon all the greedy Great ones of the World, but as ſo many pitiful Ants, furiouſly contending for a poor ſimple grain of earth: and truly, the vaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his high ſpirit, from all ſublunary things, made the whole Globe of the World, appear to him no otherwiſe, than as a little point, and that almoſt imperceptible: good reaſon therefore had his Moſaical prudence, to be unwilling, to trouble himſelf at all about it; but enough has been ſaid as to that, ſo we'l haſten, from the unwillingneſſe of theſe our two Grand Maſters to accept, to celebrate their promptneſſe, fidelity, and activity, in the glorious execution, of their ſeveral Charges: which will abundantly appear in our after Aſcents, and Parallels.</p>

            <p>Firſt <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> upon our <hi>Moſes</hi> his coming to Court, and receiving his firſt ſummons, (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being obedient to the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and giving the people their deſired liberty to go and ſerve him) calls his Cabinet-Council about him,<note place="margin">Exod. 5.</note> and by their politick ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170384:43"/>
encreaſeth preſently the Iſraelites Taskes, on purpoſe to inflame them to a muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and make them murder thoſe that came about to deliver them.<note place="margin">Exod. 6.</note> But the Lord, who ſtills the roaring of the waves, and the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the people, is pleaſed quickly to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie them, and make them comfortably to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, to their barbarous burdens, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and patiently to expect the day of their deſired Redemption.</p>
            <p>When this ſubtile piece of king-craft, would not ſerve proud <hi>Pharaohs</hi> turn, and all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Junto, were at a ſtand, the Devil muſt be preſently employed, and all the Magicians of the Land, ſent for, that they, forſooth, may beard this great Embaſſadour of God, and vye with their diabolical enchantments,<note place="margin">Exod. 7.</note> divine Miracles: So <hi>Moſes</hi> could no ſooner caſt his Rod down upon the ground, to become a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; but thoſe deviliſh Sorceres, would do as much, though all theirs, were to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the Divine Rod. Nay, Rivers turned into blood, and producing of innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Frogs, could not out-do their cheating inchantments. But when the ſacred Rod was to be ſtretcht forth again, and the duſt of the earth ſmitten into lice,<note place="margin">Exod. 8.</note> then, <hi>Ars tua Typhe ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet,</hi> the Magicians are all at a gaze, there their Sorcery is quite confounded, and they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to confeſſe, that the Devil, their good Lord and Maſter, hath a power limited; for ſilly lice, of which man is naturally a creator, are<note place="margin">Ibid v. 19.</note> enough to confound theſe great Negro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancers,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170384:43"/>
and make them acknowledge, and adore the finger of God.</p>
            <p>Now, after all this, when malice, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, could do no more, yet the Tyrant will be ſtiff ſtill, till his Court and Kingdom too be infeſted, and invaded, with huge Armies of flies, whoſe grievous ſwarms, boldly ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Royal Chamber of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>; then he begun to be inclined to let the children of Iſrael go: but he had no ſooner got from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Rod, but he relapſeth into his old diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, obſtinacy, and hardneſſe of heart, neither would he let the people go. Then followed the miraculous Murrain upon beaſts,<note place="margin">Exod. 9.</note> with the plague of boiles, and blaines, upon the more beaſtly, and brute men, with the moſt ſtupendious ſtorm of fire, and water, mingled together, that ever the earth felt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or ſince, before <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would be brought to incline, to our <hi>Moſes,</hi> and his peoples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: But he had no ſooner got once more a reſpit from thoſe plagues, but he ſtood at a defiance with God Almighty again, and his Embaſſadour too. Then muſt millions of Locuſts be ſent for, to make his hard heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, which he did again ſoon, for a little time,<note place="margin">Exod. 10</note> but returned preſently to his inſolence, and Tyranny. Then prodigious palpable dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe muſt be ſent, a darkneſſe thick enough to be felt; yet proud <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelf, had no feeling, longer than he remained under the importunity of the plague: ſtill relapſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his old obduration of heart, till the Lord
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170384:44"/>
was pleaſed, at midnight, to ſmite all the firſt-born of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> from the firſt-born of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that ſate on the Throne, to the firſt-born of the captive lying in the dungeon, and all the firſt-born of cattel. Then was the Tyrant throughly ſtartled; he roſe up in the night, he and all his ſervants, and all the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> and there was a great cry in <hi>Egypt,</hi> for there was not a houſe, where there was not one dead.</p>
            <p>This was a blow indeed, that reacht to the very heart of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all his people; who now,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> with tears in their eyes, are turned from being Tyrants, to be ſuppliants, and do humbly beſeech their Petitioners, to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of their own deſires; nor onely ſo, but offer to accommodate them for their journey, with all neceſſaries, lend them all their Jewels of Silver, and Jewels of Gold, and Rayment, and to give all ſuch things as they required. O wonderful converſion! but yet <hi>Tantae molis erat,</hi> &amp;c. So great difficulties had our great Patriarch <hi>Moſes</hi> to encounter, before he could arrive to be a Captain-General. And now he has begun his moſt miraculous March, with a Pillar of a Cloud before him, for his <hi>Quita ſol</hi> by day, and a Pillar of fire for his Torch by night;<note place="margin">Exod. 14.</note> Yet <hi>Pharaoh</hi> will have another fling at him, and thinks now by force of arms, to deſtroy thoſe abroad, whom he could not ſecurely keep at home, in quiet bondage, by all his arts and policies: But behold the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy of all Prodigies; The Red Sea is cut
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170384:44"/>
into a Royal high-way, for the Iſraelites, and made a dreadful grave for the <hi>Egyptians</hi>: Thoſe mighty waters ſtand all on heaps, and congeale themſelves into walls, as it were of braſſe, for the defence, and ſafe paſſage, of the people of God; but diſſolve themſelves into liquid floods, for the overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all his Chariots: who were no ſooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, than overwhelmed; and ſo they ſunk down as lead, in thoſe mighty waters; as our great <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf expreſſeth it, in his Song of thankſgiving to God, for that ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Deliverance.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be infinite, if I went about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, the Myriads of wonders, that our <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhewed afterwards in the Deſart, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this choſen Army; which quickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming faithleſſe, and mutinous, yet by the prayers, and for the ſake, of our moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Moſes,</hi> was the Almighty pleaſed never to forſake them; but to feed them conſtantly with miracles, ſhowring Quailes upon them for fleſh, and the Bread of Heaven for them to eat; and gave them continual Prodigies to drink, from the very firſt bitter waters at <hi>Marah,</hi> which he turned to be ſweet, to the ſtrange tapping of the Rock in <hi>Horeb.</hi> So happy are the people, who have the Lord for their God, and ſo dear and dutiful a ſervant of his, for their Leader, as this our firſt <hi>Moſes</hi> was, and our ſecond cannot but appear to be.</p>

               <p>I believe, truly, that there is no intelligent Perſon living, that looks upon this long Story, of our preſent Aſcent, but would take the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the children of Iſraels Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to be throughout Typical of ours, and all the circumſtances of effecting it by the firſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> as plainly to apply themſelves, to our glorious ſecond.

If any ſuch there be, we ſhall very eaſily convince them.</p>
               <p>True it is, we cannot ſay literally, that his Highneſſe was enforced to bring ſo many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous plagues upon our <hi>Egyptians</hi>; but we all, as well the people of God, as their Task-maſters, lay under the perfect moral of all thoſe plagues, before he, like another <hi>Hercules A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexicacus,</hi> did riſe up in our Iſrael, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, our ſo great and wonderful Delivery: and ſo we will now look upon him, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a perfect line Parallel, with all thoſe very actions and ſingular circumſtances; I ſay ſtill in the moral, and will dare to equal him here too, with the former mighty <hi>Moſes,</hi> even in thoſe his moſt ſtupendious paſſages.</p>
               <p>And firſt we may ſee, how our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:170384:45"/>
had no ſooner caſt his ſacred Rod upon the ground, here in <hi>England,</hi> that is, did vote in open Parliament, to undertake ſo juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a War, as that for the redemption of this people, out of their Captivity, then more than <hi>Egyptian,</hi> but the Magicians of <hi>England</hi> likewiſe, that is, the pretended Prelats, and their party, would endeavour to do the like, and, in effect, did ſo; for they turned their crooked Croziers, into frery Serpents too, raiſing of men, and arms, to reſiſt our Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Reformation; but the ſacred Rod, of our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> as that of the former, has mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly devoured all their bloody and ſerpentine endeavours. Nay, when rivers of blood, were made to run upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> ground, in our juſt defence, they would needs, likewiſe, by their Negromantick malice, make thoſe Rivers to overflow with blood too, for the ſupport of their Tyrannical and uſurped power: which that they might the better do too, they would raiſe their ſwarms, and infinities of Frogs to follow them, I mean, thoſe croaking and skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Church-men, that were the trueſt Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets of the War, whoſe Religion onely was intereſt, and God their gain, ſo made it their buſineſſe, to cover their pernicious prelatical deſigns, with the cloak of the Goſpel, not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo they might, by preaching, infuſe their malice into others, to become Caſt-awayes themſelves; as the Apoſtle forwarns us of them, and our bleſſed Saviour too, terming them Wolves in Sheeps cloathing. But yet,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170384:46"/>
when our glorious ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> was pleaſed to ſtretch forth his Divine Rod again, and ſmite the duſt of the earth into Lice <hi>(ſit verbo venia)</hi> that is, when he raiſed from the duſt of the earth, thoſe poor, humble, ſelf-denying creatures, that were as much nothing in their own, as in the worlds eye, I mean thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Perſons, as they have ſince proved themſelves, whom he then new modell'd into an Army; Then thoſe, all the pretended Great ones, were at a gaze; their malice nor magick could do no more.</p>
               <p>But yet further, let us obſerve, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how poor We, ſuffered under the moral, of all thoſe other plagues of <hi>Egypt</hi> too, until our ſacred ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> undertook that mighty Work, <hi>has Terris &amp; Templis avertere peſtes</hi>: Were we not oppreſt in like manner, with thoſe innumerable armies of Flies, thoſe inſolent animals, ſtrange ſwarms of buzzing Courtiers, that were ſtill begging of their eaſie Maſter, ſome private Boon, or other, to the prejudice of the Publick, putting their fingers in every diſh, and picking ſomething out of every mans pocket, or property; and has not our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered us likewiſe from all thoſe? Then for the miraculous plague of Boiles and Blaines, had we not enough of thoſe too, by the malice of our Monopoliſts, Projectors, and other Encroachers, upon the poor ſubjects liberties, and properties, which have been truly called in all Ages <hi>

Common-wealth? And has not his Highneſſe, our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> his ſacred Rod, that is, his Sword, moſt happily, and timely, lanced thoſe ſores, and given us a ſure and perfect Cure? Then, as for thoſe horrid ſtorms of Hail, Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Fire mingled with water, of which the Earth never ſaw the like, as the Text tells us; What did they emblematize to us, but thoſe dire ebullitions of Tyranny, over our Religions, liberties and properties, which went not onely about to deſtroy our preſent fruits, but to take away all our Natural, and Eternal Rights in them? And has not our glorious ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> given us a bleſſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery from all that miſchief too? Then for thoſe millions of Locuſts, that invaded the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi>; what legions of lewd Lawyers had we, that ſwarmed amongſt us like to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillers indeed, from the unjuſt Judge, to the ſordid Advocate, and from him, to the meaneſt Clarke? a ſort of men, that could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate their Laws, like a noſe of wax, to all intents and purpoſes whatſoever, making the ſacred Seat of Juſtice, it ſelf, a ſtalking-horſe to Tyranny; Law to countenance op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and Truth it ſelf to lye? And has not our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> pretty well delivered us from all thoſe petty-fogging plagues too? Then was there ever any more prodigious darkneſſe, over the face of a whole Land? ſo groſſe an ignorance of Religion? all Divinity, forſooth, and ſaving knowledge, being bound up, and rooſting it ſelf in a pitiful, lazy, luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,

Biſhops Rotchet, as in its onely San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary; I am ſure the whole light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, was concealed under the ridiculous cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Canonical coats, as they call them, and we kept in more than <hi>Egyptian</hi> Darkneſſe, till by the flaming Sword, of our ſecond <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> we were reſtored to that wonderful light, which we lately have, and do ſtill enjoy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his late Highneſſe his, and his Princely ſons, Government. Then, for the laſt plague of all, which was the ſmiting of the firſt-born, what can be more parallel to it, than the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage cruelty, formerly exerciſed by the Court of Wards, over the heirs of all the Principal Houſes of <hi>England</hi>? who were there doubly ſmitten, both in their perſons, and eſtates; Their lands pillaged by every poleing Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and themſelves ſold like ſlaves, or hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in a Market, and condemned to what is commonly worſe than death, to a wife of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans election. From all theſe Plagues, and Diabolical inchantments, has not our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Moſes</hi> moſt happily freed us too? and, to crown all his glories, as the former <hi>Moſes</hi> did, Has he not ſeen a <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Armies drencht in a Red Sea of their own blood?</p>
               <p>Now, how impoſſible it is to conceive, that all this could be brought about, without the miraculous aſſiſtance of the Almighty, they can beſt judge, who have been the witneſſes of his great Actions, and know how remarkable his proceedings have been, from the very firſt undertaking of theſe Nations Deliverance:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170384:47"/>
For, firſt he began but with one poor ſingle Troop, which how inſtantly grew into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, and that into an Army, and that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to give Laws, as it were, to all the World, no man can believe, that has not ſeen it, or elſe been taught faith enough, to underſtand the Cloud, that <hi>Elias</hi> ſaw no bigger than a hand, which in a moment, overſpread the whole heavens; or that Fountain of <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> which, in the beginning, crept on with little noiſe, through the Meadows, and in an inſtant, turned into a great River, &amp; that River into Light, &amp; this Light into a Sun, and ſuch a Sun which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded both luſter, and water, to all the World. The plain truth is, that the acceſſion of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes Forces, as his ſucceſſes, have been ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, that they appear more like viſions, than realities; and, as antiquity can find nothing in the like kind, (unleſſe this preſident of our firſt <hi>Moſes</hi>) for to equal them: ſo Poſterity will be as much puzled to believe them, as we ſhall ſee more at large, in our future Aſcents, which treate of the invincible Valour, match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Prudence, and incomparable Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Military Conduct, in theſe two our Moſaical Maſters.</p>

               <hi>MOſes</hi> was moſt miſerably diſturbed, and injuriouſly perſecuted, with the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent miſprizions, malitious repinings, and ungrateful murmurings, of the common people: And, indeed, it is not a little won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, to obſerve, how our Patriarch, has no ſooner eſcaped from the face of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and malice of his Magicians, but, he is brought to a terrible trial of his patience, with his own people: who find themſelves, no ſooner out of bondage, by his means, but they muſt preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet their tongues at liberty, to raile againſt their glorious Captain, and Deliverer.</p>
            <p>Now, firſt they begin their game, upon the ſight of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> purſuite of them; flying upon him thus. Becauſe there were no graves in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eod. 14.1.</note> haſt thou taken us away to die in the Wilderneſſe? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor were they ſooner delivered from that danger, being led dry-foot through the middle of the Ocean, which had ſwallowed up the fury of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all his Hoſt: but coming on the other ſide of the Sea, they muſt murmur again,<note place="margin">Exod. 15.24.</note> againſt poor <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe the waters there, were ſomething
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170384:48"/>
bitter, and ſo he was conſtrained to deal a double Miracle, the one to ſweeten the waters, the other them; ſo the people were for the preſent pacified.</p>
            <p>Now their thirſt was no ſooner quenched, but they muſt be murmuring again, for want of bread, and upbraid their Redeemer, for their very Deliverance, telling him in plain terms, to his face, that he might have done well to have let them alone, when they ſate by the fleſh-pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and did eat bread to their full, taxing him of a deſign, to ſtarve them in the Wilderneſſe.<note place="margin">Exod. 16.3.</note> Then was bread moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully rained down from Heaven, to ſtop their mutinous mouths, and yet that moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, and celeſtial food, could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them; for at the very next turn, they muſt make as fierce an out-cry for a little wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Nay, the Text tells us, that they were ſo inſolent, as to chide with <hi>Moſes</hi> for it,<note place="margin">Exod. 17.2.</note> and the place was called <hi>Maſſah,</hi> and <hi>Meribah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the chiding of the children of Iſrael: Yet the Lord being pleaſed to appeaſe ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe a people,<note place="margin">V. 7.</note> made <hi>Moſes</hi> whom the murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at, to beſtow another miracle upon them, and to broach a Rock, to afford them drink.</p>
            <p>And yet after ſo many ſtupendious ſupplies of their wants, and more miraculous forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, to puniſh their repining ſpirits, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of diſobedience, and ſedition, will not ſo be ſatisfied, but this rebellious people, muſt be ſtill grumbling again againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> till the fire of Heaven, had almoſt conſumed them all;<note place="margin">Num. 11.</note>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:170384:49"/>
and yet at the importunity of good <hi>Moſes,</hi> that all was no ſooner quenched, but they muſt nauſeat, and loath, the very bread of Heaven; and cry out, forſooth, for fleſh. Nothing we know can ſatisfie irregular appetites, yet that luſt of theirs muſt be ſatiated too, by ſuch a ſhower of Quailes, as never the earth ſaw, though there, that meat was made a mortal poiſon to the mutineers. Nay, yet, after all theſe fair warnings, ſo many miraculous ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, and ſo much long-ſuffering of the Lords, and his ſervant <hi>Moſes</hi> with them, they muſt pick a quarrel with him ſtill; nay, go about to make a general revolt, and to depoſe him from his Charge, and all, forſooth, becauſe they ſaw before them, the huge bugbear Gyants of the ſons of <hi>Anack</hi>:<note place="margin">Num. 14.</note> for they ſaid unto one another, We are brought hither, to fall by the Sword; Come let us chuſe another Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and let us return into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was a diſmal mutiny indeed, and for that, the Lord would have extirpated them all, but for the importunate prayer of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured <hi>Moſes</hi>: Though it was ſo contrary to his own intereſt too; for the Lord offered him, to make of himſelf a people, mightier, and a greater Nation, than they were: but the gracious Lord was ſo taken off from his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and our Clement <hi>Moſes</hi> was content to continue the Charge, and ſtill charitably to conduct ſo rebellious, and diſobedient a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though their many after mutinies, and baſe murmurings, drew more and more plagues

Vinegar is ſaid to be very neceſſary, for the purifying, and poliſhing of ſome precious Stones, which have their fire (as it were) frozen over, and their luſter eclipſed, by ſome dark ſubſtance, or earthy interpoſition: So great ſpirits, ought to have ſome little touch or taſte of Acerbities, to enlighten their valours, and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate all their other vertues: And ſo I doubt not, but that we ſhall without much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, in this particular, accompliſh our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Parallel.</p>
               <p>Has our glorious ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> been leſſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170384:50"/>
injured by venemous tongues? leſſe perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the miſprizions, repinings, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious murmurings, of theſe mutinous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than our firſt <hi>Moſes</hi> has been, with his ſtiff-necked Iſraelites? Or, has his Highneſſe ſhewed leſſe patience in bearing, or greater magnanimity in contemning thoſe curſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies, with which ſome Diabolical creatures have attempted to aſperſe his Divine vertues, than that his firſt Pattern or Prototype has done? No, his moſt Serene Highneſſe, could never be diſturbed with thoſe petit clouds of vulgar ignominies, no more, than the Supream Sphere of the celeſtial Bodies, can be moved, by any diſtempers here below.</p>
               <p>His Sacred Highneſſe, likewiſe knew, that he had a greater example, than that of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Moſes</hi> too, to follow, in that grand point of temper, towards his people, and that is the Almighty Lord of Heaven himſelf. Who has borne more injuries from the wicked mouths of men, than his Divine Majeſty has done? inſomuch, as old <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Tertul.</note> That to bear an injury gallantly, is a true ray of the Divinity it ſelf: and <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cyprian: de patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</note> as elegantly as he, in his Treatiſe that he compoſed of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, confirms to us, That this brave bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of injuries, is not onely the proper ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of true Nobility, but a moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious property of the Deity. <hi>Eſt nobis</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>cum Deo virtus communis, inde patientia incipit, inde Claritas ejus &amp; dignitas caput ſumit</hi>; So he is bold to make it not onely to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170384:51"/>
be the very Eſſence of God, but the Clarity, and Dignity of his Nature. And indeed, when we deeply conſider, the great long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of our good God, for ſo many Ages, how he has permitted to ſtand ſo many Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of abominable Idols, that were erected to the very contempt of his holy Name, and in the defiance of his Power: How he has been pleaſed ſtill to ſuffer dayes and times to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvolve, rivers to glide, winds to blow, the Spring to put on a green, and the Autumn a ſaffron Robe, grapes and corn to ripen, the Elements to ſerve, and hold univerſal Nature in breath, to ſupply a thouſand millions of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, every day offered to Hell it ſelf; How he has ſtill continued to caſt even flowers from Heaven, with a bountiful and free hand upon the audacious heads of his moſt contumacious enemies, who better deſerved to have received ſo many ſtroaks, of his angry Thunder-bolts.</p>
               <p>So, when we conſider, the great long ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and patience, of our ever bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, in bearing the curſed contumelies, and inſolencies of the perfidious Jews, which were ſo horrid, that total Nature it ſelf groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, the Sun could not behold them, but be eclipſed, nor the Stars attend, but in their ſad and mourning weeds, and the whole frame of the Univerſe, ſuffer a moſt ſharp convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, both above, and below his Croſſe; and yet he in the mean time, as unconcerned in his own ſufferings, was pleaſed to remain upon it quietly, though bloodily affixt to it, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170384:51"/>
as in a chair of State, without any the leaſt emotion.</p>
               <p>Who would not now ſuffer himſelf to be carryed away, with the ſtudy of this moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious vertue, of Magnanimous longanimity, and ſuffering unworthy injuries? And ſure, next to this un-imitable pattern of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighties, which we have ſeen, that of our firſt great Maſter <hi>Moſes,</hi> is moſt conſiderable, whoſe ſteps, in this too, our moſt pious ſecond, has ſo clearly traced, that they may be more truly called the very ſame, than Parallel: Onely here's the difference remaining,; our firſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> couragiouſly and kindly ſuffered the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, frequent murmurings, and mutinous diſtempers of a company, of poor, wandering and hunger-ſtarved Jews, in a Deſart; and our glorious ſecond, has been ever graciouſly pleaſed to paſſe by the more malitious railings, and revilings, of our own too high-fed, pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, inebriated, brutiſh people.</p>
               <p>I ſhould be infinite, to enumerate the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous abuſive libells, they have caſt out againſt his goodneſs, with the particular Calumnies &amp; diſgraces, they have endeavoured to aſperſe his Highneſſes Serene Perſon and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment withal; and indeed the foulneſſe of them, would ſtain through the cleaneſt language, that I could wrap them in, I ſhall therefore paſſe them by without reciting, as he has done without taking notice of, or revenging them: For he, juſt as the Royal Prophet <hi>David,</hi> did chuſe to bear thoſe honourable wounds, which
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170384:52"/>
the envenomed tongues of ſuch as <hi>Shimei,</hi> had thrown upon his reputation, and ſo was to mount to the Throne of <hi>Saul,</hi> by his ſteps of patience; witneſſed in ſuffering <hi>Saul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So I will be bold to conclude, that his late Highneſſe, like a perfect true man of honour, did no more trouble himſelf with thoſe inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious dealings of the wicked World, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving thoſe ill returns, from his moſt unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and unworthy back-biters, than does the Sun in the firmament, to behold the Clouds, which he himſelf had drawn, from the mire and fens of the earth, to make himſelf a Skarf of. He knew very well, that he ſhould, as he could not chooſe, but for ever have the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand of them, and though they might darken his aſpect ſomething, for a time, and malitiouſly hinder themſelves from the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his moſt excellent vertues; yet they could never deprive him, of his proper light, or other ſober, well-tempered, and more thankful ſouls, from receiving the favour of his better influences; as we ſhall continue to prove in the proceſſe of our ſucceeding Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, and happy Parallels</p>

               <p>Of all the cruel unkindneſſes in the World, there are none that pierce ſo to the quick, or are ſo deeply ſenſible to a Noble nature, as thoſe which it receives from perſons whom it has obliged.</p>
               <p>Indeed, we find that thoſe ungrateful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of injuries, for favours received, do bring aſtoniſhment even to the gates of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf; which cauſed the Almighty Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to ſigh out thoſe lamentable complaints, by the mouth of the Prophet <hi>Hieremy</hi>:<note place="margin">Hieremy.</note> 
                  <hi>How comes it to paſſe, that my beloved hath committed ſo many outrages, ſo many miſdemeanours in my houſe?</hi> as much as to ſay, <hi>Have I then, O my beloved, lodged thee in my Temple, have I nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed and bred thee up from thy Cradle, with my Fatherly hand, and cheriſht thee in my boſome;

now to betray my honour, and thus to defile the glory of my Altars?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">David.</note> So the Royal Prophet tells us, that he could have born any thing from an enemy, or a ſtranger; but from one that he truſted, or from an intimate familiar, and boſom-friend, to receive an injury, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy return, was beyond his power to bear with patience: and the truth is, it were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſtagger the greateſt Saint: Yet this was our firſt <hi>Moſes</hi> his miſerable condition, as we have ſeen, and ſhall find it fully parallel'd in our ſecond.</p>
               <p>Now it is manifeſt, that it is our Heavenly Fathers conſtant courſe, to put his children to the full proof and exerciſe of their vertues, to inſtruct them to the higheſt pitch, to be as near imitators, as they may be, of his own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine vertues; who does nothing but good to ungrateful man, and receives nothing but ill from him; as we ſhewed at large in our laſt Aſcent. And ſuch trials as thoſe, are que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe very neceſſary for his ſervants; for it is undoubted, that his moſt practiſed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, a very <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, would putrifie in long proſperities, as in a dead Sea, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth nothing: ſo that the All-wiſe God, out of great kindneſſe, to his moſt dear ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, does ſometimes ſtrike ſuch blows as theſe, that they, as <hi>Jonathan,</hi> may have their eyes ſtill open, and ſuck in honey from the very end of the Rod, that ſcourgeth them, and in the ſevere chaſtiſement of a father, finde the conſolation of true children. O what a

goodly Theater, is a good conſcience! and what a beautiful Arcenal it is, to have the Armes of vertue ſtill in a readineſſe, as our firſt and ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> have had againſt all eſſayes? whom no unkindneſſe of unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friends, or conſpiracies of ungracious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, could ever ſtartle from their ſweet, and ſerene repoſe.</p>
               <p>Now, that we may make good our Parallel, we muſt reflect a little upon the barbarous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, that his late Highneſſe has met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, from Perſons of other obligations, and Princes too of our Aſſembly. And truly, who would not have thought, after ſo many wonderful Deliverances, by the hand of our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> as we have ſeen, and the beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of all open oppoſitions, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the common enemy; but that our miſeries ſhould have had an end, and our glorious Captain-General ſome reſt? But yet I muſt ſay, with a ſigh, and to the eternal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probration of ſome perſons, late in power, that we found no other, but <hi>aliud ex alio malum,</hi> one miſchief to follow upon the very heels of another. How many malignant parties of our own have gone about to diſturb that happy peace, purchaſed with the price of ſo much blood? and no ſtone left unſtirred, to throw us into a ſecond, and a third, and (may be) into more confuſions, and greater than the former, and that by ſome of our Elders too, as I have ſaid, and Princes of the Aſſembly? Nay, our religious brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> too, muſt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170384:55"/>
be ſet on foot again by them, to make their Covenant a ſtalking-horſe for Rebellion, and to renew a war in all probability, more cruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and dangerous, than the former: But our moſt Renowned ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> being born upon the wings of that Providence, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failed him, made a moſt happy, and quick diſpatch, of that work; putting an end to all thoſe Kirk enchantments, both here, and there, for the preſent, and I hope for ever. And yet after all this, that by the gracious providence of God, and his Highneſſes great care and prudence, all means of making head, and imbodying themſelves again, was taken from them: I ſhould be infinite to tell, how often thoſe of that leven, have ſhewed their venemous teeth, againſt his Highneſſe, his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and moſt godly deſigns, to diſturb him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and our peace. Nay, ſome of thoſe, that have had the greateſt ſhare in his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe his Succeſſes, I mean, ſome of thoſe El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Princes, of the Aſſembly, moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, undutiful perſons, that durſt with the <hi>Atlantes</hi> of old, ſhute their malitious arrows againſt the Sun, and caſt ſtones at him, that gave them bread: nay, ſome of them too, when they could not bow Heaven to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, would endeavour to ſtir up Hell againſt him, confound elements, and mingle ſtars with the duſt of the earth, to come to the end of their moſt exorbitant pretenſions: But the Lord, who alwayes took him to his moſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care, ſet him ſo far above theirs, and the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170384:55"/>
Divels malice, that hurt him they could not, though themſelves they might, like the Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisk, with the repercuſſion of their own poiſon: The fagot ſmoaks onely when it begins to burn, but when the flame has once got the upper hand, there will be then no ſmoak at all.</p>
               <p>Natural Philoſophy informes us, that the Rain-bow in the Heavens, is not eaſily to be form'd at Noon, in the heats of Summer; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Sun being then vigorus in his alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, diſſipates and waſtes thoſe Clouds: So our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> being mounted, as he was, to the higheſt pitch of Heroick vertue, diſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all oppoſition. Malice it ſelf could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther find Bow nor Arrow to reach him; but burſt it ſelf with its own venemous intention: ſo did all calumny crack it ſelf before the truth of his vertue, which darted reſplendent flaſhes into all eyes. We know it's ſaid of old, that <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitatis umbra invidia,</hi> There are no ſhadows without light, nor is there any envy without ſome gift of God. No man thinks it ſtrange that Cantharides ſhould fix themſelves upon Roſes; it is certain, that vermin will not be ſatisfied, but with the faireſt and the ſweeteſt flowers. But that which ſeems moſt ſtrange to me, and truly it is not a little admirable, that men heretofore ſo honoured for wiſdom, and good affections to the Publick, ſhould run ſo ſtark mad with malice, as to go about ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant a buſineſſe, as to ſwim againſt the ſtream with the ſilly frog, hoping to ſtop the

It would be an endleſſe piece of work, to enumerate the infinite plots, conſpiracies, treaſons, and aſaſſinats, contrived and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed upon his ſacred Perſon; but he ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſlept in the arms of the ever-waking provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and could not but be confident in ſpite of all the malice of men and Devils, but he that had ſo raiſed him to, would ſtill preſerve him in, his moſt illuſtrious ſtate and condition.</p>
               <p>I ſhall onely take leave to expoſtulate a little with thoſe perſons, and ſo conclude this Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel. Are you not aſhamed yet of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, you children of the Scottiſh Belial? Had you had one drop of true Engliſh blood in your bodies, you would have been readier to ſpend that for him, than to take his from him. What, you would be all Kings? we remember indeed, too lately, that you were ſo; and you would have a perpetual ſeat in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament too, as you once thought you had got? and truly, it is great pity, but it were ſo again, especially being ſo good Patriots as you have
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170384:56"/>
been? I wonder truly, that then you did not vote your ſelves to be immortal too. Let any temperate and knowing man in <hi>England</hi> now be Judge, whether when you ſate ſo, with all your power and ſplendor about you, ſo loudly proclaiming your ſelves ſuch Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical members, you did not ſtink in the noſtrils of all the people?

                  </note> for ſuch (as the Learned <hi>Bernard</hi> tells us) are all dignified perſons without merit: and ſo accordingly, his Highneſſe ſacred wiſdom, ſpied you out, and amongſt the reſt of his moſt incomparable Heroick A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which he has engraven with a Pen of Adamant, to conſecrate to all Poſterity, he then ſent you out in your own ſnuff, the ſtench whereof, is not yet, nor will be, I believe, in the next Age, extinguiſht.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, the Moon may ſeem for a time to darken the Sun, when it is eclipſed; but yet ſhe daily renders the tribute of her light: So all the malice in the World, that has made a ſhew to darken his Highneſſe for ſome time, cannot at all obſcure, but muſt encreaſe his praiſes, by its ſlanders, as it did advance his repoſe by its oppoſitions, and augment his Crowns by his humiliation. Nay, my Lord being of nothing ſo ambitious, as to be like his Great Maſter <hi>Moſes,</hi> has traced the ſteps of that his great Archetype, to the very height of all charity, towards theſe his moſt violent,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170384:57"/>
and undeſerved adverſaries, and all their Complices. Have we not ſeen him, like that his firſt Maſter, frequently proſtrating himſelf at the foot of the Tabernacle, praying, and almoſt binding up the hands of God, to ſtay the courſe of his vengeance, againſt thoſe that perſecuted him even to the Tabernacle; nay, would take into himſelf likewiſe, a piece of Reverend <hi>Aaron</hi> for his Pattern, ſtanding in the Majeſty of his Prieſtly habit, with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſory and Sacrifice in hand, to appeaſe the anger of God againſt his perſecutors, when Heaven was all on fire over their heads, and the Earth became a devouring gulph under their feet, to ſwallow them up. Our moſt Renowned Lord Protector, could never be leſſe than a <hi>Moſes</hi> to them, though they did continue never ſo much to be a <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> unto him: So we ſhall proceed from thoſe wretched injuries, he received from ungrateful men, to thoſe Noble, Princely, and high exaltations, that he alwayes found within his Moſaick ſelf.</p>

               <p>His Highneſſe was never of the temper of thoſe ſpirits, that upon the miſconſtruction of a word, or a cold countenance, muſt presently deſire to ſee a man with his ſword in his hand, and ſwear that they will evict reparation from him, ſealed with his blood. No, it cannot be but an argument of a baſe ſpirit, and of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble extraction, to ſeek out occaſions of quarrelling, and Duelling; for by that ſure, they muſt have ſome deſign, to blot out ſome ignominy of their births, or other unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Heretofore truly, none but ſlaves, lackies, butchers, gladiators, or ſuch kind of fellows, did uſe that trade of Duells; but now forſooth, the opinion of ſome fooles, will make it fit for Gentlemen: But our firſt, and ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> ever had ſuch pitiful <hi>Hectors</hi> in extream contempt, who go about by that means, to purchaſe glory out of vice, gain hell by their execrable carriage, and but acquire on earth, the qualities of a Clown. They have taught us, that we are not to make our
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170384:58"/>
ſelves like <hi>Fierabras,</hi> nor the Knight of the burning-ſword, in matter of valour: and I dare aver, that if there were a hundred ſuch like <hi>Rodomonts,</hi> brayed, and ſtamped to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in a Morter, they would not be able to make up one half ounce of true fortitude. Nay, I have ſeen ſome of thoſe moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate fellows, to fight Duells, when they come to bear arms in a good cauſe, where they ought to ſhew true valour, and an undaunted reſolution, they have been the firſt that have moſt deſperately run away; they have paſſed over hills, without being ſenſible of the aſcents, through woods, without ſeeing of a tree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and meaſured many miles without caſting one look behind them; nay, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time whole flocks of them together, that will run away like ſheep, with the very appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a fear, that the noiſe of their own feet gives them.</p>
               <p>Our firſt and ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> were as little given to make diſcourſes of their own Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; Thoſe who brave it moſt in words, are moſt commonly found moſt failing in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. When <hi>Homer</hi> makes his braveſt Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to march, he gives them alwayes ſilence for a guide; contrariwiſe, he makes cowards to babble, and chatter like Cranes. The firſt paſſe along like great Rivers, letting their ſtreams glide ſoftly with a ſilent majeſty; but the ſecond keep a murmuring, and bubling, like little Brooks: Indeed, the world is too full of theſe <hi>Rodomonts,</hi> now called <hi>Hectors,</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:170384:59"/>
who are tranſported with od, arrogant, and ſudden furies, like <hi>Rabſheketh</hi> in Scripture, and yet will tremble at the Lancet of a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, and cry out for a little pain, more than a woman in Labour: in ſhort, the true ſign of not being valiant, is to ſtrive to ſeem to be ſo.</p>
               <p>Our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> was known to be none of all this Swaſh-buckler brood, ſprung from the race of <hi>Cadmus,</hi> derived from the teeth of Serpents; and yet never more ready to eat, than to fight, upon a good occaſion, nay, a Duel out too, if there were a cauſe for it; that is, either in the Head of an Army, by publick conſent, againſt ſome <hi>Goliah,</hi> to defend the honour of his Nation, and ſo to end ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table War, and ſtay a greater effuſion of blood: or elſe, if juſtly called to it, in his own, or any dear friends vindication; not upon ſome ſilly Chymera of ſpirit, upon the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome ambiguous words, or, which is worſe, for the love of ſome unchaſt woman, who will not be otherwiſe propitiated, but with the ſacrifice of humane blood. No, this is no part of our Moſaical courage: The men of this make, were always thoſe that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe fought againſt, and proved upon them in the end, that, to be a true compleat Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Souldier, was not to become a braving <hi>Cyclop,</hi> without any feeling of God, or ſenſe of Religion, but ſuch a one as his Maſter <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> would have him to be, that goes into the field; that is, clear from all wickedneſſe, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170384:59"/>
uncleanneſſe: and ſo accordingly did our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> alwayes make his ſacred choiſe of men. His inſpired wiſdom, knew full well, that none are fitter to go to War, than thoſe, who had made their peace with God, nor can there be any more valourous, than he that has a true fear of the Lord before him: for firſt, ſuch a mans ſoul is a Fort impregnable, which cannot be ſcaled with ladders, for it reacheth up to Heaven, nor be broken with batteries, for it is walled with braſſe, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined by Pioneers, for he is founded upon a rock, nor betrayed by treaſon, for faith it ſelf has the keeping of it, nor be burnt with granado's, for that can quench the fiery darts of the Devil, nor yet be forced by famine, for a good conſcience is a continual feaſt.</p>
               <p>It was not for nothing then, that theſe two great ſouls of honour, our firſt and ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> would not onely be ſo provided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but have all that followed them, be ſo likewiſe, and to carry about them, the whole armour of St. <hi>Paul</hi>; for undoubtedly there is nothing ſo ſtrong, nothing ſo invincible, and triumphant, as a valour, which marcheth bravely under the Rules of true Chriſtian Religion: Whatſoever Mr. <hi>Machiavel</hi> would perſwade us, that Devotion and Piety, are the greateſt weakners of courage, and warlike diſpoſitions, and that honeſty and vertue, do but expoſe a Prince to dangers; the truth of it is, of a Prince as he has propoſed him, he has made little better, than a wilde beaſt, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170384:60"/>
yet would perſwade us, tis a man, and none I preſume, will believe it, but ſuch as carry their eyes in their heels.</p>
               <p>The brave <hi>Belizarius,</hi> ſure was of another opinion, who was one of the moſt excellent Captains in the World, being to put ſome lewd ſouldiers to death, for ſome military crimes, declared his mind ſo freely to his Army, in theſe Terms,<note place="margin">Procop. lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Bello Vandal.</note> that <hi>Procopius</hi> recites: <hi>Know ye</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I am come to fight with the arms of Religion, and Juſtice, without which, we can expect neither Victory nor Happineſſe; I deſire my Souldiers ſhould have their hands clean to kill an enemy. Never will I ſuffer any man in my Army, that hath fingers crooked or bloody, were he in arms as terrible, as lightning: force is of no worth, if it have not equity and conſcience for companions.</hi> This now, methinks, was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken like a Souldier indeed, like the very ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is moſt certain, that no man can looſe his courage, but he that never had it, and no man can have it, if that he beg it not of the true Lord of Hoſts. Where is light to be ſought for, but from the Sun? or water, but in Rivers? and heat, but in Fire? and where think you to find true Strength, but in the God of the ſtrong? I mean, not that ſtrength of body, that <hi>Milo</hi> had to carry a heavy beaſt, but the ſtrength of ſoul and courage, to carry a man through all extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; which hath its root in reaſon, its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in piety, and its Crown in true glory:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170384:60"/>
and this courage our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> had to the full, and that I hope, there is no man but will grant, is ſo far from being leſſened, that it is onely heightened by Religion, and godlineſs. His ſacred Highneſſe therefore choſe for his Companions in arms, none of thoſe roaring, ranting fellows, that think there is no way to be eſteemed valiant, but to dare to be impious, to make the pillars of heaven, to tremble with their blaſphemies, and have nothing of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in them, but to pill, and ravage, in their Quarters, like Harpyes, and to feed themſelves with humane blood; and in a word, have but this one ſhame left to them, that is, not to be ſhameleſſe. What a ridiculous thing is it, in the mean time, for people to live like <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clopes,</hi> that they may be accounted valiant, and act the part of Turks, to gain the reputation of good Chriſtian ſouldiers? But here his Highneſſe his pious wiſdom, moſt eminently, after the example of his Great Maſter <hi>Moſes,</hi> has ever ſhewed it ſelf, and made us to know ſuch perſons well enough: his inſpired judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, could never be ſubject to ſo much fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, as to take chaff for Gold, hemlock for Parſly, or an Ape for a Man; and he has plainly taught, and proved to us, that all their pretended courage, is nothing elſe but deſpair and rage, boiling in their paſſionate breaſts, and counterfeiting vertue. So I hope we ſhall have no more ſuch falſe ſpectacles clapt over our eyes, by that ſpirit of lyes forged in the ſhop of Hell, to make us take that glaſs
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170384:61"/>
for Diamond, and thoſe Keſtrells for Faulcons; indeed, fitter for Stallions, than War-horſes; all their courage is nothing but a boiling fury in their hearts, like to that of ſome Lunaticks, or poſſeſt with an evil ſpirit, which makes very children, and women, to be ſometimes ſtronger, than many men; But ſuch as theſe, were none of our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> his election; for he being to go on God Almighties errand, would have no aſſociats, but ſuch as the Lord ſhould approve of, and were free from all manner of uncleanneſſe, as that Great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of War, and his incomparable Preſident, both preſcribed, and practiſed.</p>

               <p>By equal calculation of our Modern Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts, as well as Chronologers, we do finde, that God indulg'd double the life to men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Flood, to that he has done ſince the very next Age after; and yet to them too, vouchſafed twice ſo much time of living, as he has done to us: So that if thoſe great Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of Nature, and Antiquity do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> his forty years and upwards, may appear parallel to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's fourſcore, at, or about, which times, they both were preſt forth into Publick em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.

O that I had never ſaid that word, my tongue falters to ſpeak, my pen is palſie-ſtrook to write, and my heart trembles to think, that our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> his dayes were ſo ſoon to have an end; for we had no temporal good thing more to pray for, in order to the State, or our ſelves, but that the bleſſedneſſe we enjoyed under his late Highneſſe, might be eternal, and that we might perpetually live and flouriſh under the comfortable and pleaſant ſhadow of his Palms; but we have too lately ſeen, that he, as a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> is gone as he came, and left us nothing, but our own peace, and his precious memory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him. But I muſt paſſe by this paſſion, leſt it make me guilty of too great a digreſſion, it being a diſcourſe more proper for the cloſe of our Parallels. And indeed, however we finde our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> Parallel to the firſt for number of years, That I cannot ſo certainly determine, as I can for the vigour of his ſoul, and acuteneſſe of his ſenſe, no one of which, to the very laſt Scene of his life, was any whit dulled or diminiſhed, more than the eye of his Great Maſter <hi>Moſes</hi> was; an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary bleſſing doubtleſſe, vouchſafed by the Divine goodneſſe, to his dear ſervants, to get youth by years, and beauty it ſelf by time;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170384:63"/>
as we have ſeen perfectly proved, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his late moſt Serene Highneſſe, our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> as has been recorded of that our firſt Great Patriarch his Prototype.</p>
               <p>Then for his great diligence, fidelity, care, and skill, in diſcharging all Truſts committed to his Charge, no man can at all diſpute, that has either ſeen, or heard, of the indefatigable labours of his Life. His Highneſſe knew that idleneſſe was a meer moth of Noble mindes, and iron it ſelf ſure, if it had the reaſon to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, underſtanding to chuſe its one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, would cry out to us, that it better loved to be kept in conſtant uſe, and exerciſe, than to lie ruſting, and conſuming in the corner of a horſe: Wherefore we ſee, that God does not ordinarily entertain great ſouls, in the pleaſures of an idle life, but in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid exerciſes of vertue; for we know that there are many moſt excellent fiſhes that will die in ſtanding waters, and are delighted in the moſt bubbling ſluces, and turbulent ſeas, and rivers; and the beſt birds, will alwayes be abroad in the moſt troubled air.

Indeed, this laborious vertue, which is no ſmall one in an officer, his Highneſſe was more Maſter of, than any that I ever heard, or read of: If any Work were to be raiſed, his hand muſt be in it firſt, if any duty to be done, his preſident muſt be ſtill the foremoſt; ſo by rare skill ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Captain, and the common Souldier together, he did both intend the diligence of others, from whom he might, though not ſo effectually, have exacted it; and eaſe the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of their labour, by making himſelf a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and partaker of their pains and travel: But of this, and his other great pieces of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, we ſhall ſay more in our next Aſcent, where we ſhall repreſent him a moſt compleat Captain-General.</p>

So did he make a like Election of his Officers, and Souldiers, and do the workes of Gyants, with the reputed <hi>Pygmies</hi> of the world: I hope I have not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto undeſervedly brought him for my late Lord Protectors pattern,d Indeed, this is the ordinary cuſtom of Almighty God, to keep his richeſt Pearls in ſhells, and moſt precious perfumes in poor boxes.</p>
               <p>Men of this World, we know, do quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as we ſaw manifeſtly proved by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party, where moved the old Magadepies of the Church, and Butter-flies of the Court, with ſome other great things, called Lords,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170384:66"/>
who becauſe they had (it may be) a gallant valiant man forſooth, for the Grandfather, thought that they might, very ſecurely, be Cowards, ſo ſpending ſtill upon the ſtock of their great Anteceſſors (though to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether they were lawfully begot, or not) ruined their own ſelves. Theſe pretty gawdy things, lived in the world juſt like Snailes, keeping their glorious houſes over their heads, and in their grave Majeſtick courſes, (almoſt as ſlow as theirs too) made very fine long ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver traces, but were nothing elſe indeed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but meer froth. They had alwayes their backs like Cuſhions, covered with Velvet, Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, and what not, but their inwards we ſee, were nothing but hay, or ſtraw. They made a glorious oſtent of leaves to the World, and a fair verdure, like an over-grown wood; but are within repleniſht with nothing but Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents.</p>
               <p>Theſe perſons ſure, having nothing at all praiſe-worthy in them, would dignifie their perſons with apparel, ſhewing us plainly, that they had like Peacocks, little heads, leſſe brains, beautiful feathers, and a long taile; which yet it ſeems, by their ſtrutting about the ſtreets, are non clypt ſhort enough, with ſome of them, though in good time, I doubt not but they will be. So I paſſe from theſe pitiful nothings, (whom his Highneſſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired prudence, and skilful conduct, would never admit to ſerve under his Enſignes) to ſome other more worthy piece of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170384:67"/>
Conduct, and the next ſhall be the exact Diſcipline our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> alwayes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, which is indeed, the very ſoul of an Army, and without which, they would march, as the Hiſtorian tells us, <hi>Multi homines, pauci viri,</hi> Many bodies, but a few men, or indeed, more like Salvages, than Chriſtians. From the neglect of this it is, that we have ſeen in time of War, ſo many <hi>Caniballs</hi> in arms, that caſt nothing but fire, and blood from their throats, <hi>Menaces</hi> alwayes marching before them into Quarters, and ruine and deſolation bringing up the Reare: Barbarous villains, that think becauſe they have a ſword by their ſide, they are therefore to be Maſters of the lives, and eſtates of other men. It is moſt certain, great courage is neceſſary to make a true Martial Diſcipline be obſerved; but yet it is to be done, as we ſee in this very Army of our late Lord Protector, that he has left behind him, to be in truth, a mirrour of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and never yet was equalled, no not by that which <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> commanded, as <hi>Lampridius</hi> relates,<note place="margin">Lamprid.</note> all whoſe ſouldiers, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to the <hi>Perſian</hi> War like Senators, and the Country Peaſants loved them as their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and honoured their Emperour, as a god:<note place="margin">Marcus Scaurus.</note> Nor yet by that which <hi>Marcus Scaurus</hi> writes of, whoſe Regiments encamped round about a great Tree laden with fruit, and yet the ſouldiers were kept in ſuch order, as not to dare, though they were to depart the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to take one apple from the Maſter of the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170384:67"/>
place. In this very manner, did our glorious ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> alwayes conduct his men,<note place="margin">Vopiſc. in Aurel.</note> giving them that Admirable Leſſon, which the moſt pious Emperour <hi>Aurelian</hi> gave to ſome of his Officers: <hi>My friends,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if you will be Captains, nay, if you will live, contain your ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in their duties: I will not that a Peaſant ſo much as complain, that he has been wronged in the value of a chicken, nor that any has taken a grape from his Vine, without his permiſſion. I will have an account of every grain of ſalt, or drop of oil, unjuſtly exacted. I deſire my ſouldiers ſhould grow rich with the ſpoiles of enemies, and not by the teares of my Subjects. I would have them carry their riches on their ſwords, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Hutts, or Cabbins. I would have them chaſt in the houſes of their Hoſts, and not any the leaſt quarrel or diſorder heard of amongſt them,</hi> &amp;c. If Heathens could teach us ſuch Leſſons of civil deportment in armes, what a ſhame is it then for ſome Chriſtians, to march as we ſee them do, more like <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi>? and that men who are made we know, for the ſupport of men, and who are not ſtrong, but for the defence of the feeble, ſhould be more pernicious one to another, than Wolves and Beares, nay, than fire, hail, ſerpents, inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and famins? By this means it is, that warfare, otherwiſe a moſt honourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, is made a deteſtable trade, and the Commanders of thoſe unruly Armies, are likely the firſt that ſuffer by them, themſelves, and all the countenancers of ſuch debaucht

               <p>All this his late moſt Serene Highneſſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes abhorred, and prevented; for which reaſon it was ſure, that all the hearts of the poor people, of this Nation, which ſo much ſighed under the former miſcarriages of our Civil War, being indeed reduced, to almoſt a periſhing condition, by the ill conduct of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Captains, freely bloomed, and newly opened themſelves, as Roſes, at the benigne, gentle, and yet ſevere brave aſpect, of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable perſon, our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he came into general Command; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it was ſure, that God ſo bleſt him in all his Battels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Aſſault, and warlike Enterpriſes, that he was ſucceſſeful in them all; for Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers we know, never fight well, and beſides, tis certain, that the juſt God tyes a ſecret ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to thoſe Standards which march for his glory, and are not beſmeared with the blood of innocents.</p>

fortune, or properly ſpeaking, the deareſt Darling of Divine Providence, that ever the Chriſtian World produced, was this moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perſon, his late moſt Serene Highneſſe. His ſucceſſes were ſo conſtant, that we may ſay, he had ſtruck a naile in Fortunes wheele, that ſhe ſhould never be able to turn it again.

But now here, before I proceed any further, I muſt be bold to make a ſtand, and ſadly intermix the water of my eyes, with my ſorrowful inke, and with a mourning pen, deplore the madneſſe of thoſe men, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged us in our late unnatural Wars. Ah poor <hi>England,</hi> Paradiſe of the Earth, Eye of the World, Pearle of all Beauties, How many times by the means of thoſe infernal ſpirits,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170384:70"/>
haſt thou ſeen thy fruitful boſome, heretofore Crowned with ears of Corn, and Guilded with Harveſts, all briſtled over with Batalias? How many times haſt thou ſeen, thy land co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Swords, and thy Seas with Ships? How may times haſt thou felt the arms of thy children encountering within thy proper en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails? How many times haſt thou ſeen flames of brothers hoſtility flying through thy fat and fragrant fields? when haſt thou not ſweat in all the parts of thy beautiful body? when have not rivers of blood been drawn from thy veins, and ſuch blood as would have cimented the beſt Bullwarkes for thy defence againſt all forreign enemies whatſoever, and if well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, had made the great Enemy of Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endom, the Turk, ere this to tremble at thy Standards, and have re-planted again, the plains of <hi>Paleſtine</hi>? But all has been ſacrificed to Furies: But I forbear, leaſt that I loſe my ſelf in my provoked Paſſion; and indeed, I would willingly paſſe over this diſcourſe with ſilence, as over coales covered with aſhes, were it not, that as it was fit to expoſe maſſacred bodies to view, thereby to cure the madneſſe of the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Maides, ſo we are bound to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the bloody effects of this unnatural war, to raiſe a horrour in all good ſouls, againſt the unhappy cauſes of it. And yet truely, we have no little reaſon to rejoyce in thoſe very ſufferings, &amp; congratulate with our ſelves, the blood-ſhed it ſelf of thoſe barbarous Wars, if we could at no cheaper rate, have aquired the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170384:71"/>
enjoyment of thoſe moſt ineſtimable bleſſings, and benefits, which we have ſince received; and above all the reſt, the ſoveraign influence of that moſt precious perſon, our late Lord Protector, and ſecond <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thrice bleſſed <hi>England,</hi> in ſuch a purchaſe, though with ſo much coſt and paines. O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py voice of Thunder, which made this Hinde bring forth ſo glorious a birth, after ſo many terrible throws, and ſuch direful agitations of many years. And for the happy cloſe of all this, we may again remarke another piece of Heavens eſpecial Providence, and quiet all the diſtempers of our ſouls, with an humble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of that mercy, and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Divine Juſtice, which in ſhort, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to this. When the Lord is pleaſed to purge a Kingdom, or Nation, defiled with ſin, he chooſeth alwayes a people more righteous and religious than they were, it being forever moſt juſt, and reaſonable, that they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their goods, who will have no ſhare in their vices. So our <hi>Moſes,</hi> and his Iſraelites, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged and overthrew the wicked Egyptians; So <hi>Arbaces</hi> vanquiſht the debauched <hi>Sarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napalus</hi>;<note place="margin">Salvian.</note> So <hi>Alexander</hi> conquered the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate <hi>Perſians</hi>; And ſo the <hi>Goths</hi> gained the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> as holy <hi>Salvian,</hi> more at large illuſtrates: So to return to our late great Generals ſucceſſes, and diſpatches, which as it is notorious, have been ſo ſtupendous, that the preſent ſpectators of them, did take them, as aforeſaid, more for viſions, than realities. The
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170384:71"/>
celerity of his Expeditions was ſo great, a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſo much commended in <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> that he alwayes as far out-went his <hi>veni, vidi, vici,</hi> as ever he did, the Cunctator <hi>Fabius. Jebu,</hi> a man of an active ſpirit, was employed againſt the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> to bring it to a quick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; for God Almighty, when he means to ſhave clear, alwayes chooſeth a Razor with a ſharp edge, and never ſends a ſlug upon a meſſage that requires haſt; So our great <hi>Oliver,</hi> we ſee when he came into General command, diſpatcht more work in one year, than all the Armies of <hi>England,</hi> had done in three, or four, before.</p>
               <p>This it was to have one of the Lords own election to command over us, and ſo much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own heart, that we ſee he has conſtantly tyed, as aforeſaid, a ſecret vertue to his Standards, making winds and tempeſts, to fight under his Enſignes, opening for him lands inacceſſible, calming ſtormy Seas, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with petit handfuls of men, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfit huge Royal Armies, to take in Towns impregnable, cleave Rocks, and hew through Mountains; nay, to do the works of Gyants, as aforeſaid, with the reputed Pigmies of the World, and find facility in all that humane reaſon conceived impoſſible; So that we may count more Victories of his, than Encounters, his Palmes being perpetually verdant as well in the frozen ice of Winter, as in the ſcorching heats of Summer. Nor was <hi>England</hi> alone the Scene of his great Actions, but the very miſts
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170384:72"/>
and foggs of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well as the woods and boggs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> will all come in to atteſt his glories; for the barrenneſſe of the one, nor the barbariſme of the other, could ſet a period to his proceedings, or give a foile to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>Now to ſumme up all his Souldier-like Excellencies; (for I muſt haſten out of this large Field, leaſt I be loſt in't) if we may by the moſt eminent qualities of inferiour crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, be capable to conceive his matchleſſe perfections. The moſt exquiſite character of a compleat Captain, or Man at Armes, is by ſeveral Authors delivered to us thus; That is one, who has the aſſault of the wild Bull, the defence of the wilde Boare, the flight of the Wolfe, the courage of a Lion, and the craft of a Fox: This ſtrange compoſition, his Highneſſe had to its higheſt perfection, as he has been ſufficiently ſeen in all poſtures; but above all, what a ſpectacle it was, ſometimes to behold him in his Lion-like poſture, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt covered over with blood and duſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ranks of his afrighted men, and performing both the office of a great Captain, and moſt Couragious Souldier, and ſo by that means, reſtoring a Day in danger to be loſt. Then ſometimes again, to ſee him, leading his well Diſciplin'd Army, into enemies Quarters, and by his meer Conduct, conquering vaſt Armies, and reducing their ſtrongſt Garriſons, without one drop of blood; and ſuch dry Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, were alwayes his deareſt delight: as
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170384:72"/>
indeed they are alwayes moſt honourable. <hi>Ingens victoriae decus, citra domeſticum ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinem bellanti,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tacitus,</hi> The greateſt glory of a Victory, is that which a Captain gaines by the leaſt expenſe of home-bred blood: And this was his Highneſſe his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſtudy to do; nay, his endeavour like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was, to ſave as much as he could of his very enemies blood. He never ſought to purchaſe fame, by ſuch a cruel vanity, as <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great did, who building a Temple to <hi>Minerva,</hi> cauſed to be engraven over the Gate of it, how he had taken, routed, and ſlain, two millions one hundred fourſcore and three thouſand men; pillaged, and ſunk, eight hundred forty ſix Ships: made deſolate one thouſand five hundred thirty eight Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Towns. If this be the way to glory, his late Highneſſe ſure has ſteered a clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary courſe; for he has written, and engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by his Actions, on the Gate of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Eternity, the Men, Ships, Cities, and Towns, that he has preſerved. <hi>Haec divina potentia eſt, gregatim, &amp; publicè ſervare,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Senec. de Clem. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>26.</hi>

By the other way, it may be, his Highneſſe might have rendred himſelf more remarkable and terrible, like a dreadful Comet, by the ruine of the World; but our glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, knew, nothing could be ſo honourable as to ſave: So we never ſaw his Highneſſe put up his ſword, but his anger too, ever hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170384:73"/>
with <hi>Nicetus,</hi>

               <hi>MOſes</hi> was a moſt abſolute great Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a perfect Maſter of the Politick Science; which, though it may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently argued, by all the advantages which he had of breeding within the Tropicks of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court;<note place="margin">Exod. 2.</note> ſo muſt of neceſſity have ſuckt in the very quinteſſence of all State in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluencies, as alſo being trained up in all the Learning of the Egyptians,<note place="margin">Acts 7.12.</note> then the moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people in the World, as we have already ſeen: Yet, is made more clear, by the Lords own deſignation of him, to the Civil,<note place="margin">Exod.

greatneſſe give priviledge to free things from diſtemperature; Tall men, we ſee, are as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Fevers, as others of leſſe ſtature; and great Empires are as eaſily diſturbed, as the States of petit Princes. Beſides, an excellent Author tells us, <hi>Tueri quaeſita, difficilius eſt quàm acquirere, quoniam in acquirendo, ignavia poſſidentis ſaepe plus confert, quam propria virtus, tueri autem quaeſita, ſine propria virtute nemo poteſt.</hi> It is harder to hold, than to Conquer; for the ſloth and negligence of the Poſſeſſor, may more conduce to the acquiring of any thing, than the vertue of the Conquerour; but hold what is ſo acquired, none can, but by eſpecial vertue.</p>
               <p>Now both theſe pieces of incomparable Prudence, had our moſt Renowned Lord Protector, our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi>; and I dare ſay, in equal proportion with the former, he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the War it ſelf, like a compleat Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and managed peace, like a prudent Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170384:75"/>
executed by the knowledge, how fitly to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age an opportunity. If this piece of warlike, as well as State prudence, were ever verified in any Perſon, it has been moſt remarkably made good in all our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> his State diſpatches, as well as Warlike Expeditions: for had he not in the very nick of time, cruſht ſeveral eggs, of curſed Cockatrices, that had been laid againſt him, he muſt have hatched them in his own boſome, that would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed both him, and us.</p>
               <p>Are you not yet aſhamed of your ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, you viperous brood of Rebells? that have ſo often endeavoured to eat through the heart, and bowels of him, that has given you ſo often a life?

Be no longer like ungrateful Prentiſes, who uſually when they are at liberty, ſpurne at their Guides, and are not onely content to ſet up Shops for themſelves; but ſeek by all means they can, to diſcredit their Maſters.</p>
               <p>By this time, methinks, you ſhould be ſenſible, that you have too long oppoſed your ſelves, againſt his late Highneſſe, moſt pious, and prudent intentions, who with ſword in one hand, and trowel in the other, that is, armes, and policy, as a Stateſman, and a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, at once did defend, and build the walls of our <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

will appear to be but like a City, which I have ſeen in ancient painting, built upon ruines, in a land of Quickſilver, cimented with blood, and overthrown with frequent Earthquakes, and outragious windes: You ſee by your own ſad experience, if you pleaſe to make uſe of it, that if the arm of the Lord ſuſtain not an Affaire, the more advancement it receives, the deeper ruines it findes; and that all Maxims of State, that depend not on the Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of God, are but the meer effects of carnal prudence, and ſo muſt conſequently end in fleſh, and faile like it: And all Councils of State whatſoever, that depend not, and reſt themſelves upon him, who with three fingers ſupporteth the Globe of the Univerſe, rather purſue the way of precipice, than path of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation; Give over, I ſay, in time your Antichriſtian contentions, leſt you be found to fight againſt God. Imitate, now at laſt, this bleſſed and moſt worthy Piece of our Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal wiſdom, which our Great Prototype, and his Typified Parallel, have ſo cloſely purſued, that is, in the firſt place to ſeek the intereſts of God, and then all other things will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as we have ſeen proved upon both them, a conſtant ſucceſſe attending all their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings. On the other ſide, we finde what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>Machiavel</hi> may object to the contrary, that God Almighty is pleaſed, ſometimes, to ſtupifie the moſt practiſed Statiſts in the world, that are the greateſt profeſſors too of Policy, and Knowledge, and make them ſo drink of

the cup of errour, that we coming afterwards, to diſcourſe upon their judgements, find they have committed ſome groſſer faults, in the governments of Kingdoms, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, than the ſimpleſt, and moſt illiterate Peaſants would have done, in the direction of their own houſes; all which we have ſeen moſt particularly made good upon the late King and his Counſellours, and to be foretold likewiſe by the Spirit of God himſelf, dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the perſon of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who ſpeaking of the wicked Counſellours of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 19.</note> ſayes, <hi>The Princes of Tanais, are become fooles, the Princes of Memphis are withered away, they have deceived Egypt with all the ſtrength, and beauty of her people: God hath ſent amongſt them, the ſpirit of giddineſſe, and made them reel up and down, in all their actions, like drunken men.</hi>

               <p>There is no man, that has either been Actor, or Spectator, in our troubles, but will take, I preſume, thoſe Scriptures, to be directly poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at our times, and to be an exact propheſie, of part of our late Wars: ſo will neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170384:76"/>
any more comment, application, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel. It is a moſt certain truth, and that his late Highneſſe knew full well, and as frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, that no wiſdom or policy, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humane, can be perfect: ſuch as forſake God, in the curioſities of their Counſells, ſhall be forſaken by him, and ſhall finde each where, a long web of perplexities, and a rowling wheel of immortal troubles.</p>
               <p>When a man goes on in the right way, he is probable to finde an end, but if he wander acroſſe the fields, he makes ſteps without number, runs into errours without meaſure, and falls into miſeries without remedy. Let all the Politicians of the World take example by our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> and take into their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration, as his Highneſſe did, that the greatneſſe of a Stateſman, conſiſts not in treaſuring up the Common-wealth of <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Xenophon,</hi> in his imagination, nor in amaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing together a huge heape of politick Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, nor in being acquainted with all the Cabales, and Myſteries of the World, nor in the profeſſion of great ſubtilties, and ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems; for we have ſeen by the experience of all Ages, that in affairs, there is a certain ſtroak of the Divine Providence, which daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all the worldly wiſe, diſarmes the ſtrong, and blindeth all the moſt Politick, with their own lights: for ſwimming up and down, as they do, in the vaſt Ocean of buſineſſe, and the infinities of reaſons of their proper inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they reſemble bodies over-charged
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170384:77"/>
with abundance of blood, who through that great and extravagant exceſſe, finde death, in the very treaſure of life. Then ſeeking to withdraw themſelves, from the road of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon underſtandings, they figure to themſelves ſtrange ſubtilties, and chymera's, which are but as the Towers of the <hi>Lamiae,</hi> that <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ſpeakes of, which no wiſe man did ever really believe, or will; which is the true cauſe that their ſpirits floating ſtill in ſuch a great tyde of thoughts, ſeldom meet with a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py diſpatch of affairs. Not unlike the Sun, that ſometimes draws up ſuch a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of vapours, that he cannot diſſipate; ſo theſe undertaking Politicians, do but lay up together, a vaſt lump of buſineſſe in their braines, which their judgements can never diſſolve into any ſucceſſeful expedition.</p>
               <p>He that will take the pains to read the lives of <hi>Otho, Vitellius, Galba, Piſo, Balbinus, Floria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Baſilius, Silvianus, Tacitus, Quintilius, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus,</hi> and <hi>Michael Colophates</hi>: or behold the falls of <hi>Parmenio,</hi> under <hi>Alexander, Sejanus</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Tiberius, Cleander</hi> under <hi>Commodus, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavius</hi> under <hi>Conſtantine, Eutropius</hi> under <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadius, Vignius</hi> under <hi>Frederick, Brocas</hi> under <hi>Philip, Cabreca</hi> under <hi>Peter,</hi> and others of the like kind, muſt find, or be wholly inſenſible, that to raiſe a State, and build Fortune, as well as to conſerve it, we are to proceed, as his late Highneſſe did, ſecurely therein, with a principal eye upon the Maxims of Faith, Religion, and Honeſty, unleſſe that we will
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170384:77"/>
expect, in the courſe of an uncertain life, a moſt certain ruin.</p>
               <p>It will manifeſtly, I ſay, appear, out of all Hiſtories, as well ſacred as prophane, how (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Machiavillian</hi> doctrine) all they, who diſunited from the Eternal Wiſdom, thought to play the Politicks and proſper in Governments, Honours, and worldly Affairs, have proved but as ſo many Icarus's, that counterfeit birds, with waxen wings, with which they may ſoare aloft indeed, for ſome little time; but the leaſt ray proceeding from the Throne of the Lamb, will ſure diſſolve them to nothing, and make their heights, which they ſo fooliſhly flye at, ſerve them for no other uſe, but to render their falls, the more remarkable.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now onely adde, for the further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of all <hi>Machiavillians,</hi> and ſatisfaction of good men, one excellent obſervation, out of <hi>Paulus Oroſius,</hi> who, in his Book of Hiſtory,<note place="margin">Paulus Oroſius, lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> dedicated to the great <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> remarkes, that the very tracks of our proud and politick <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Chariots, after his moſt deteſtable death, and the deſtruction of his whole Army, remained a long time, on the ſands of the Red Sea, to be a preaching example to all Poſterity, to inform them, how dangerous a thing it is, to go about, as he did, by any State-tricks, and deviliſh ſubtilties, to fight againſt God. Let then our Maſter <hi>Machiavillians,</hi> march on ſtill, if they think fit, amongſt ſo many ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, and precipices, not ſo much as once open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

For his father-in law <hi>Jethro,</hi> coming to ſee him, and finding him to ſit alone, to Judge the people, which ſtood about him from the morning until evening, was much troubled at it, and gave him a true fatherly counſel indeed; which was to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the burden of the Government, between ſome ſufficient perſons, amongſt the people,<note place="margin">Ver. 19.</note> that were accompliſht for ſo great a work: So <hi>Moſes</hi> choſe out Men of Courage, fearing God, men dealing truly, hating covetouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Ver. 22.</note> and appointed them to be Rulers over Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and over Hundreds, and over Fifties, and over Tens.

               <p>This was a Noble Aſcent indeed, and not onely becoming a man of State, but ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, that our Maſter <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, ſtood in need of an Admonitor to it, and probably had not mounted it, but by the ſage advice of his good father-in-law <hi>Jethro,</hi> as we have ſeen in the Aſcent: which as in all the reſt, our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> his late Highneſſe, has ſo exactly pattern'd, that he is to be drawn into example by all ſucceeding Princes, and his prudence to be adored by all Poſterity, as well as the preſent Age,</p>
               <p>There is none, I believe, will doubt, but that it is a Soveraign and Supreme Piece of Politick vertue, to make diligent ſearch, and inquiry into the abilities, and integrities, of all ſuch as are to be employed, as Miniſters of State, or Juſtice; and this, I ſay, concerns not onely the Chief, but all inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; for let the perſon in government be never ſo great, and abſolute a Maſter in all State matters himſelf, if he be diſſerved by thoſe, whom he does employ, his vertues will be but betrayed by the crimes of others, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170384:79"/>
expoſe the people to multiplied injuries. This point therefore of Politick prudence, in a Prince, is much beyond any other perſonal perfections,<note place="margin">Tho. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin. <hi>2.2.</hi> q. <hi>58.</hi>
                  </note> that may be called accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in a Stateſman, as the Learned <hi>Aquinas</hi> tells us, and gives the reaſon, <hi>Quia bonum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune praeeminet omni bono ſingulari</hi>; This politick vertue exceeds all others, as much as the publick good ſurpaſſeth any particular; for he that it contented to draw himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the guard of his own vertues onely, and neglect the looking into the manners of others, that are to be his inſtruments of State, will of neceſſity be enſnared in his own goodneſſe, and will ſignifie no more to the publick bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, than thoſe fooliſh Muſicians, that made all their harmony within themſelves, and were content to ſee all the World beſides out of Tune.</p>
               <p>This horrid negligence, has made many good Kings odious to their Subjects, and though excellent perſons in themſelves, yet tamely ſuffering themſelves to be lead by their Favourites, have fallen not onely into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, but ruin of Tyrants, and ſtink ſtill in the noſtrils of the people. Some great Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of Nature, as <hi>Theophraſtus de Plantis,</hi> and that excellent Naturaliſt, <hi>Joannes Roellus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Theoph. de Plantis. Jo.

under the leaves, and ſhadow of it, till ſuch time, that getting wing, they become a kind of Butter-flie, all ſpeckled over with gay flowers, and brave it over men in the air, whom they durſt hardly not long before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold upon the earth. Juſt ſo, do careleſſe Kings and Princes, like this pitiful, though Rbyal Plant, cover under their fair verdure, creatures which gnaw like worms in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, upon the ſubſtance of their Maſter, and afterwards frame themſelves wings, all enamell'd with glory, at the charge of the Publick, to take their flights over the heads of ſo many Mortals, whom they look upon as ſcornfully as if they had forgot the earth that bore them; but ſometime, they meet with a fall, proportionable to their flight, and their Royal Maſters and Makers, are alwayes invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in inevitable ruin.</p>
               <p>Our firſt, and ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> we ſee, full-well underſtood that danger, and have taken courſe accordingly, to prevent it, by employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none in Publick Charges, but men of piety, as well as parts, known integrity, as well as ability; knowing nothing to be ſo perillous to Princely greatneſſe, as wicked Miniſters, and that good Officers, muſt make great Stateſmen, as well as Captain-Generals. Has not, I ſay, our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> made out his Parallel in this, to its perfection? Was there ever ſuch a choice, ſince that of the firſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> as he has made of men of Courage, fearing God, deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly, and hating covetouſneſſe, whom he
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170384:80"/>
has adopted into all the Offices about his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Eſtate, Army, or Juſtice? Look back upon his Highneſſe ſitting in his Family, and then, how can you but phanſie, the beautiful Roſe ſurrounded with the fair attendance of its elegant leaves, all in a Livery? Conſider him in his Council, what can you ſay leſſe of him, than that he was a Princely Palme, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſt with moſt ſtately Cedars, and but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon him, in his warlike equipage, and with his Martial men about him; he will then ſhine forth like the Sun, when glorified with his moſt illuſtrious rayes. And laſt of all, if we but look upon him in his power repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and Courts of Judicature, there is not a Poet ſure, but would ſay, that his Highneſſe had Courted, Reconciled, and Reduced, <hi>Aſtraea</hi> to the earth again. <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> tells us, in <hi>Vita Herodis Attici,</hi>

incur the cenſure of flattery, for it amongſt fools: And Ile begin, with his chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or Secretary of State, the intelligence of his Counſels, and as it were, the Angel-Guardian of his Government, who was ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with his great Maſter, our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> in all his actions, counſells, intereſts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, as certain flowers are ſaid to wait on the Sun, and penetrated to the very Center of his great Soul; ſo could not but contract many of his moſt Moſaical perfections: He is certainly known to be, what his name renders him by Anagramm, a True Holy one, that is, a Stateſman after <hi>Moſes</hi> his manner: <hi>viz.</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, and dealing truly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a perſon of moſt incomparable piety and parts; Prudent as a Serpent, and yet pure as a Seraphim, vertues ſo rare in a Stateſman, that we may juſtly call him, the true holy Phoenix Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titian of the Age.</p>
               <p>I have not time, nor paper to inſiſt ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, upon every one of his Highneſſe moſt honourable Privy Council; but this I can affirm, that never was a more compleat body of Council, or more exquiſite compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, of ſo many excellent Tempers together in the World; inſomuch, that we ſee noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly in every dayes diſpatches, how they are that perfectly, what the old Hiſtorian <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leius</hi> ſayes of <hi>Sejanus</hi> flatteringly, That he was, <hi>Actu otioſis ſimillimus,</hi> (in earneſt, a moſt excellent character, howſoever of a Stateſman) that he ſeemed in the middeſt of his greatſt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170384:81"/>
employments, as if he were idle. My Lords likewiſe of his Highneſſe Council, are ſo exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowing in affairs, that it was never heard, that any of thoſe ſix common obſtacles, did ever obſtruct their diſpatches, which are, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, confuſion, paſſion, ſollicitude, irreſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and precipitation, ſo they have done all things warily, fully, and peaceably, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhewing the leaſt anxiety. They have by their great piety and prudence, kept this State ſo well united within the bands of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and charity, that it cannot but appear to forreigners themſelves, as it were a little Temple of Peace, though in the very heat and hurry of War, embracing all affairs, &amp; govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, with that ſweet temper, and equality of ſpirit, that they reſemble thoſe active ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which move the whole Heavens, not uſing in themſelves, the leaſt agitation.</p>
               <p>Amber-Greece is nothing ſo ſweet, in it ſelf, as when it is compounded with other things, ſo theſe Godly, Wiſe, Couragious, and, every way, Excellent Counſellours: improve themſelves by the communication of their counſells together, and do, (even as Flint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, which by their proximity, do make their ſparkles to flie) by a holy emulation which they uſe, in the purſuite of God, not onely enlighten others, but enkindle in each others hearts, a more ſenſible, and pious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of God, and all good things, by a mutual reverberation: But I muſt haſten; for when I have ſaid all, that can Be ſaid, it
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170384:82"/>
will fall ſhort of their moſt Moſaical merits; So I ſhall conclude with them, in ſaying onely, that they are all perſons, compoſed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Jethro</hi>'s character, and that when our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> adopted them into his ſecret counſells, we could none of us deny, nor can yet, but that it ſeemed his late Highneſſe had drawn ſo many Angels from Heaven, to fix them at the ſtern of his Eſtate; for they are all of them, as unlike their Predeceſſors, as all the World can wiſh them. Then, if we but conſider a little, the excellent choice, his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe has made of Commiſſioners, and Keepers of his Great Seal, we cannot but acknowledge that they are perſons, without any exception, fitted, for ſo great a work, that carry a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Court of Chancery engraven in their breaſts, and bear, <hi>jus aequum &amp; bonum,</hi> written in their very foreheads.</p>
               <p>For the Lords Commiſſioners of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe Treaſury, they cannot be queſtioned to be of as exact a choice, and equal diſpoſition for the great Truſt, ſtill men of our Moſaical temper, fearing God, and dealing-truly; and ſo we may ſafely affirm, that our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſelected Perſons for that employment, as well as other, to whom he might as ſafely have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his conſcience, as he did his purſe: Men all as honourable in their breedings, as Noble by their births, of as profound Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ability in the Laws, as of ſublime honeſty and fidelity to their Country; and of a moſt unſpotted integrity, both towards God,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170384:82"/>
and his Highneſſe, their late Moſaical Maſter.</p>
               <p>I ſhould be infinite, to inſiſt upon all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men of Honour, employed by his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: So I ſhall ſpeak onely ſomething to our Parallel of Moſaical Judges, to which our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Aſcent naturally leads us, and leave the reſt, to be made out, by ingenuous Readers themſelves.</p>
               <p>And firſt, for that incomparable pair of my Lords the Chief Juſtices, with the ſeveral Sets of ingenious and godly Judges, Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Solicitor-General, all his Highneſſe's Council at Law, with other Officers, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendices, to each Court: They are all ſuch ſelect and eminent Perſons, and indeed, the plurality of Lawyers, from the Purple, to the Sable Robe, of this preſent Age, ſo accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht with piety, and parts, that the Divine <hi>Themis</hi> her ſelf, will not be aſhamed to call her ſelf a proſtitute in former Ages, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this production of hers, to be onely genuin, and their generation onely own to be Legitimate; and all this we muſt attribute to his late Highneſſe his moſt Moſaical influence. Their Lordſhips, I mean, thoſe excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in ſupreme Judicature, are known to live the Laws, as well as to ſee them put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Evecti in excelſum, inde magis vitia de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiciunt,</hi> as the wiſe <hi>Caſſiodorus</hi> well expreſſeth it: They know that God, and his Highneſſe,<note place="margin">Caſſiod.</note> have ſet them on high, for no other cauſe, but to behold vices beneath them, which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever does exalt, will find himſelf quickly

Their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, I ſay, have given ſufficient evidence to the World, that they know all this, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the contrary courſe; They know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be lookt upon, as Stars in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and Philoſophy tells us, that the more light a body has, the more it ought to have of participation, and favourable influences, for objects, that are in a lower degree than it. <hi>Nihil vile,</hi>

               <p>I ſhall conclude this Parallel therefore, with an exclamation of a moſt ingenuous <hi>Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>

themſelves; for very little indeed, is that Clemency to be eſteemed, which does onely abſtain to ſtrike thoſe who give no offence: No, my Lord did ever conſider, that mercy was made onely for the miſerable, and knew that in puniſhing or revenging injuries, he could onely do like the men of the earth, but by gracious clemency, and practiſe of pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was to ſhare in glory with the great Monarch of Heaven, who daily makes his Sun to ſhine on criminal heads, as well as the moſt innocent.

               <p>How often have we ſeen him, even in the very hurry of a Victory, and heat of execution, ſounding a retreat to himſelf, and ſheathing his ſword in clemency, which drawn, threatned nothing but deſtruction, and a whole deluge of blood.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170384:87"/>
likewiſe we ſee offenders are oftener refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, than by all the violence, and ſeverity of rigour: <hi>Monendo certius quàm minando, ceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do quàm caedendo ſcelera interdùm coercentur,</hi> and this accorded ſo well, with that old piece of <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> Policy, <hi>Praeſtat mille nocentes abſolvere, quàm innocentem opprimere vel unum,</hi> Better let a thouſand guilty perſons paſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſht, than to injure one onely innocent; that his Highneſſe has alwayes taken it for the ſureſt ground-work of his happy government: and for this, he had not onely the example of his Maſter <hi>Moſes,</hi> but the very precept, and practice of God himſelf: for did not he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our firſt <hi>Moſes</hi> to carry the people in his boſome, and is it not his common practiſe to govern the World by his mercy? of which if any ſhould be of ſo reprobate a judgement as to doubt, let him conſult the Prophet, who tells us, <hi>that God meaſures the waters with his fiſt, and poiſeth the heavens in the palme of his hand</hi>; which ſignifies, (according to the beſt Interpreters) that the Lord goes with a cloſe ſhut and contracted hand to puniſhments, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated by waters, but proceeds with the whole extent of his goodneſſe to reward, that is repreſented by the heavens.</p>
               <p>The Rainbow, which the Lord has taken for the ſymbol of his reconciliation with man, and environeth the Throne of the Almighty, as we find in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> it is <hi>Arcus carens ſagittâ,</hi> as holy <hi>Ambroſe</hi> obſerves, <hi>Qui terrere magis vult, quàm ferire,</hi> A bow without arrows,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170384:87"/>
that is bent, more to terrifie, than to ſtrike. Nay, the Lord makes it ſo great a matter to pardon an offender, that he will rather permit his whole Eſſence to be toucht, than his Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency to be ſo much as queſtioned: his very Title of Godhead to be invaded, rather than his glory of pardon. And yet our bold-faced <hi>Florentine,</hi> will go about to teach his Prince,<note place="margin">Mach. Princ. cap. <hi>17.</hi>
                  </note> to eſtabliſh himſelf by cruelty; as if no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhould be, or could poſſibly be made ſecure, that was not built on the bloodſhed of ſubjects; and this he goes about to prove, by the examples of <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> and the ſtern Emperour <hi>Severus,</hi> &amp;c. And then he proceeds to affirm it, for a fundamentall Maxim of State; That it is better for a Prince to be feared, than loved; for men, ſaith this wiſe Secretary, do love as it pleaſeth them, but do fear as it pleaſeth the Prince; and therefore infers, that a wiſe Prince, will found himſelf ſooner, and rely ſurer on that way, which depends on himſelf, than upon that which depends upon another.</p>
               <p>A very ſubtile inference indeed, if it were poſſible for a Prince to keep his people, ſo perpetually under ſtill, as to make them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſtoope to kiſſe the yoke for fear: but experience plainly proves the contrary, that no Tyrant in the World, be he never ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, could, or can, ſo keep his people under the laſh, but they will ſometimes get looſe, and unyoking themſelves, make the effects of their forced fear, felt by the Authors of it.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170384:88"/>
And this is apparent by the iſſues, that moſt Tyrants have found of their cruelties; as <hi>Nero, Caligula, Otho, Vitellius,</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi>: as alſo <hi>Julianus, Heliogabalus, Gallienus, Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius, Philippus, Pocas, Carinus, Zeno,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others, who did all finiſh their lives, and Empires together, moſt tragically by the ſword. And truly reaſon it ſelf, ſeems clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to me to prove, it muſt be ſo.</p>
               <p>Does not Philoſophy aſſure us, that no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence can endure long; but this kind of cruel government by fear onely, is ſet upon the higheſt pitch of violence; therefore impoſſible to be of any conſiderable continuance. And truly this politick Theſis of <hi>Nicholas Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells,</hi> ſeems ſo abſurd to himſelf, that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after he has aſſerted it, he begins to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, and temper it thus; <hi>I grant,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that Prince to do beſt, who can joyn to be feared, and loved together; but that being a thing very difficult, if not impoſſible, to be compaſſed,</hi> as he ſayes, <hi>he counſels to procure fear, rather than love.</hi> Juſt ſo, he tells us, in another place, that piety is a thing impoſſible to be in a wiſe Prince: Thus does our Politick Secretary ſerve us, like a lewd ignorant Phyſitian, who is pleaſed to make the ſick party to diſpair of health, becauſe he cannot tell how to cure him.

that impious Proverb, <hi>Oderint dum metuant,</hi> and <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who would ſeem to mitigate the malice of it, by ſaying, <hi>Oderint dum probent,</hi> the one ſaying, <hi>Let them hate, ſo they fear,</hi> the other, <hi>Let them hate, ſo they allow</hi>: But I am ſo much of <hi>Machiavels</hi> mind, that the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Moderator in this point, is in the greateſt extreme; for certainly, his eyes were never matches, that could ſee hatred, and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, march in couples together: and I ſhall willingly grant ſo much more to our <hi>Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villian</hi> Politicks, that ſome mixture of fear with love, does make the moſt excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in Government: for though the ſtrongeſt Citadel, or Caſtle, that a King can have, be his ſubjects affection, and their hearts his beſt Treaſury or Exchecquer: yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed, that love without fear, quickly turns to ſcorn, and fear without love, as ſoon converts to hatred, both equally dangerous to any Prince his eſtate.</p>
               <p>Now, though <hi>Machiavel,</hi> and his crew, did never know how to be ſo good Apothecaries of State: yet our prudent Patriarch, and his Parallel, our late Protector, we ſee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood full well, how to make that admirable mixture; for though they were great Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers alwayes, yet never forgot to be moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Fathers of their people, and in that ſacred compoſition, reſts, not onely the myſtery, but the luſter of a true Stateſman,<note place="margin">Greg. in Job. <hi>27.</hi>
                  </note> as the Great <hi>Gregory</hi> aſſures us; who ſayes, that in every good Government, there muſt be ſuch a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

made of oil and wine, that the wounds of men, may be healed in ſuch ſort, that their minds may not be ulcerated with too much ſeverity, nor yet grow too remiſſe, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe or indulgence and lenity; the rod muſt be uſed to touch, and the ſtaff to ſupport, and then they will both be comfortable to us, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us: The ſcale of Juſtice muſt be ſo equally carried, that neither love ſhould too much ſoften, nor over-great rigour tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport people into a deſpair.</p>
               <p>This right Princely temper, I ſay, was perfectly underſtood by our gracious Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch <hi>Moſes,</hi> the firſt and greateſt Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the World, and no leſſe by our glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> his Parallel. Behold them both burning inwardly with the fire of charity towards their people, and outwardly wholly enkindled with the flames of the zeal of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: as loving Fathers, they have offered their ſouls to God, even to the wiſh To be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the Book of Life, to ſave their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and as glorious Judges, they took the Sword in hand, and bathed it in the blood of wicked men. They have ſhewed themſelves in all things, ſuch accompliſht Captains, as became couragious Magiſtrates, and Embaſſadours from God, and admirable Mediators to him; pleading before him, the cauſe of their people, with prayers, and before the people, the cauſe of God, with their ſwords: and though there is none which can deny, but our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> his zeal to Juſtice was very great, a Divine
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170384:89"/>
vertue in him; yet we muſt acknowledge that his benignity, manſuetude, and clemency were vertues more naturall, and agreeable to him, which he alwayes improved too, both by the pattern of his Maſter <hi>Moſes,</hi> and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who as the Scripture tells us, <hi>Etiam ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, miſericordiae recordatur,</hi> In his very wroth remembers mercy, and ſhews his anger to us more often, by Thunder, Lightning, fiery Comets, blazing Stars, Storms, and Tempeſts, and the like, than he makes us to feel it; nor yet ſends them ſo often as we deſerve; which the Pagan Poet could obſerve, when he told us, <hi>Si quoties peccent homines,</hi> &amp;c. If <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſhould ſpend his angry Thunderbolts ſo often as men deſerve them, he would very ſuddenly diſarme himſelf; but, Chriſtianly indeed, we may ſay thus, That if his Divine Majeſty ſhould diſarme it ſelf of mercy, we ſhould quickly be reduced to miſery; and therefore it was, that he commanded our <hi>Moſes,</hi> to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his example, and carry the people in his boſome, like ſucking children, and loudly proclaims in his Word, that <hi>Miſericordia &amp; veritas cuſtodiunt Regem, &amp; roboratur clementiâ Thronus ejus,</hi> Mercy and Truth, are the greateſt guard for Kings, and Clemency is the greateſt ſupport of their Thrones. All this, I ſay, our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> has ſufficiently ſhewed himſelf to know and follow, and yet his Clemency has never expoſed him to thoſe extremes before ſpoken of, to render his goodneſſe contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible; no, he happily arrived at the bleſſed

mixture, and ſweet compoſition, that we have remarkt in our firſt <hi>Moſes</hi>; and alwayes ruled us according to the holy Rule given by an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Father, <hi>Eâ, qui praeeſt, menſurâ, ſe mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur, quatenus &amp; arridens timeri, &amp; iratus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mari debeat,</hi> He that is ſet over men to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them, ought to carry himſelf with that moderation, ſo as to be feared, when he is pleaſed, and to be amiable in his very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
               <p>This was the very Moſaical temper of our late precious Lord Protector, who had ſo much of that Divine Art of compounding his ſweetneſſe with ſeverity, that we may ſafely ſay for truth, though a very prodigious one, that his Juſtice, and his Love, (though both they are ſaid to be blind) did yet lend one another eyes; he ſo ſweetned his Sword with his Love, and ſo ſharpened his Love with his Sword, that his very ſeverity might ſeem to proceed from his love, and his puniſhments themſelves, put on the face of obligations. <hi>Caſtigavit, non quod odio habuit, ſed quod ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit</hi>; As he reformed alwayes by his favours, ſo were his chaſtiſements ſtill turned into true fatherly corrections.</p>

That a body over-charged, could not but ſinke to the ground, and that there was no Tribute comparable to the precious commodities, derived from the love of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.

by the greateſt neceſſities in the world, after the pattern of his Great Prototype, our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending Patriarch; and that truly, I ſhould humbly conceive to be enough (without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the precepts or practiſes of any other, though the godlieſt, graveſt, and wiſeſt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in all Ages, as we have ſeen) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, any phanatical <hi>Florentine,</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Politician whatſoever, under whoſe depraved Policies, we find all Cities, and Countries, that are ſubjected to them, ſtill pitifully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, the rigourous concuſſions, that they yet feel, to ſatisfie with their ſweat and blood, the avarice of ſome curſt particular Officers, who are notwithſtanding as greedy as fire, and more inſatiable than the Abyſs, or Hell it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall forbear at preſent, to proſecute this diſpute any further; for I conceive by what is already ſaid, there is no ſober Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but will conceive, that <hi>Cyclopaean</hi> piece of policy, is ſo far from being Moſaical, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to, or becoming the dignity of, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prince, that it muſt be abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and deſtructive, both to Prince and people; nay, fitter to be ſtiled Barbariſme, than a Civil Government.

               <p>If we look upon the Piety of this our Great Patriarch, or his happy Parallel, our late Lord Protector, in the largeſt extent of it, we ſhould find it, as boundleſſe as the Sea, and our ſelves ſwallowed up, in the contemplation of it; So we have reſtrained our ſelves, to the diſcourſe of that part of their piety onely, which has relation to God-ward, and a true zeal to his holy Worſhip: And firſt we find
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170384:96"/>
our Patriarch ſo ſevere and punctual in all his performances, that he would have the leaſt omiſſion of a puntillo of them, to be a mortal, at leaſt a capital ſin, the offender being to be cut off from the World, or from communion with the people: and ſo ſumptuous he was in his appointed worſhip, that all the World might ſee, that he thought nothing too coſtly for a bare ceremony of Divine Service, and that the people ſhould take notice, that, the All they had, was from the Lord, to whom they were to pay back ſo large a proportion in Sacrifice. A moſt Royal, Stately, and Magnificent, manner of Worſhip it was,<note place="margin">Levit. Num. Deut.</note> which every man muſt acknowledge that reads the ſeveral ſolemnities inſtituted by him in thoſe bleſſed Books, and worthy of the ſpirit of ſo great a Prince, Prophet, and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, as our great <hi>Moſes</hi> was.</p>
               <p>Now, has our glorious ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leſſe Religious zeal, or true Princely piety towards God? or leſſe extraordinary care, and pious curioſity, in providing for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſplendour, worſhip, and ſervice of his Holy Name? No his Moſaic Highneſſe, full well knew, that if all the mountains of the World, were amaſſed into one, and all the woods of the Earth made into one Libanus, and were ſet on fire, and all the beaſts of a thouſand fields and forreſts were turned into victims, for his Sacrifices, they would be all as nothing in value, in reſpect of his heavenly Majeſty: and if all the voices of men were
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170384:97"/>
tuned into one, and that one voice, ſo mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically made, could ſpeak like Thunder, and be heard loudly to proclaim from Pole to Pole, the glory of the Almighty, it could not be ſufficient ſo reſound his holy praiſes.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe it was, that his Highneſſe, was pleaſed frequently to approve that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and ingenious fancy of <hi>Philo</hi> that great and Learned <hi>Jew,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philo Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus in Planta Noe.</note> who has a Story, though in it, may be, nothing at all of verity, yet I am ſure, the morality of it, is very excellent.</p>
               <p>This great man, in a Book of his called <hi>Noe</hi>'s <hi>Plant,</hi> relates as a certain tradition of the Sages of his Nation, from the very beginning of the World; <hi>That God the Creator, after that he had formed this goodly Globe of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and compoſed it as a glorious Scutcheon of his own immenſe Greatneſſe, a compendium or contracted table of his chiefeſt Titles, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Mirrour, of his Divine Wiſdom and Power: demanded of thoſe bleſſed Spirits about him, which were the Angels (it may be then in glory) what they thought, of that great piece of Work? upon which, one amongſt the heavenly throng, after he had very highly commended, the curious Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, acknowledging it to be a moſt compleat Fabrick in all things, but one, and that one thing, he ſaid, was wanting to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ſo goodly a Frame, which he required as a noble Seal, to ſet upon ſo incomparable a Piece. What is that, ſaid the Eternal Father? I would deſire, replyed the holy Spirit, That there might be a ſtrong, powerful, and penetrating har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170384:97"/>
voice, which borne upon the wings of the winds, &amp; Coaches of the clouds, and Charioted tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the air, might repleniſh all the parts of the World, with an applauſe of ſo accompliſht a Piece of Work, and inceſſantly to eccho forth both night and day, the glories of God, with praiſes and thanksgivings for his Divine Majeſties moſt ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable benefits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Story truly may paſſe very well, for a pretty invention at leaſt, and not unworthy of an Angelical ſpirit, that was zealous for the honour and glory of the Lord, his Maſter and Creator. Yet by the leave of this good ſpirit, I muſt be bold to ſay, that his exception, if we take it as ſo, was in ſomething very frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; or his Complement, if we take it as ſo, was over-officious. For firſt, the Almighty had ſufficiently provided, againſt that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended defect, in compoſing the World, in the frame chat we behold, as a fair large Clock; and then proportionably giving to man the place, which this celeſtial and critical ſpirit ſeemed to require. Now, that this great Clock of the Univerſe, ſhould be alwayes in tune, to his ſervice, and Divine diſpoſition, he has laid his particular commands and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders upon each wheel, and pin, to do their parts. The firſt wheel of this grand Clock, is that <hi>primum mobile,</hi> which we find in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, the continual motion, and the ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluencies of antipathies, and ſympathies, which lie, as it were hidden, in the bowels of Nature. The hand of this univerſal Horologe, is that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170384:98"/>
goodly embowed piece of checkerwork, and frettizing of the heavenly Orbes, which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold with our eyes. The twelve Signs in the Zodiack, ſerve, as it were, for diſtinctions of the twelve hours of the day. The Sun it ſelf, exerciſeth the office of the ſteel, and gnomon, to point out time to us, and in its abſence the Moon: the other Lights and Stars, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute thereto, their luſtrous brightneſſe. The Sea gives in the azure of its waves for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as alſo the Earth produceth its varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of herbs, flowers, and fruits, for enamel of the outſide, and its whole body, for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect counter-poiſe: its ſtony Quarries, Mettals, and Minerals, for to exerciſe the wiſeſt, and learnedſt Naturaliſts, in the ſearch and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this great Creator: The leſſer and inferiour animals, are the ſmall chimes; and Man himſelf, is the great Clock, which is to ſtrike, the ſeveral hours, and ſo perpetually to render thanks, honour, glory, praiſe, ſervice, and worſhip, to this Almighty Maker.</p>
               <p>And the moſt vocal Clock to celebrate the praiſes of his Creator, (that theſe later Ages have produced) was this Man of men, our moſt pious late Lord Protector.</p>
               <p>All this, I ſay, his Highneſſe knew full well, as our great Patriarch, his Prototype did, and the neceſſity too, that there was on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples parts, to give the moſt gracious Lord of Heaven and Earth all adoration due to him; wherefore we find, how he enjoyned ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne obſervancies upon them, which though
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170384:98"/>
but barely typical, and ceremonial; yet were hugely neceſſary to ſtrike a reverend dread of the Divine Majeſty, into ſo rebellious a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Our Princely Patriarch therefore, and his Parallel, our late Lord Protector, knowing themſelves (as all other Rulers, and perſons in power are) to be ſet upon Pinacles, to change their words into Laws, and lives into Examples, were the firſt and foremoſt always, in the practiſe of this, and all other piety. The lives of Princes (they knew) are more read, than their laws, and generally more practiſed; yea, their examples paſſe altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as current as their coin, and what they do, they ſeem to command to be done; cracks in glaſſes, though paſt mending, are no great matters, but the leaſt flaw in a Diamond, is hugely conſiderable; yea, their perſonal faults, become National injuries. It is held by the Learnedſt amongſt the Ancients, that when the Sun ſtood ſtill in the time of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the very Moon, and all the Stars, did make the like pauſe; ſo all Princes, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, whoſe ſpirit is the firſt wheel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto all the other are faſtned, it is neceſſary ſhould give a good and godly motion.</p>
               <p>Our ſacred ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> therefore found himſelf (as his Princely Archetype before him did) obliged to be exemplary to his people, in all kindes of piety, propoſing no Highneſſe to himſelf, equal to that, which he enjoyed in his humiliation before his God: he never
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170384:99"/>
found himſelf well at eaſe, but when he was paying thoſe duties of piety, praiſe, honour, and glory, reverend ſervice, and worſhip, to his Divine Majeſty. Inſomuch, that we may more truly ſay of him, that which the Pagan Orator ſaid of his Emperour,<note place="margin">Plin.</note> 
                  <hi>Sanctiores effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit ipſos Deos, exemplo ſuae venerationis</hi>; He made the gods themſelves more holy, by the example of his pious worſhip: that is, he gave a reverence extraordinary to Religion, by his manner of ſerving it. The verity of this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, for we find that he has ſo happily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed all his people about him, and ſuch as well ſtudied him, to ſo high a pitch of piety, by his moſt exemplary good words, and works, that we can eſteem them no otherwiſe, than as Thunder-claps to Hindes, for the powerful production of Salvation.</p>
               <p>His Highneſſe was unqueſtionably one of the greateſt patterns of Princely piety that ever the World produced, ſince that of our firſt <hi>Moſes.</hi> He had ſo great a fear of the Lord, that he apprehended the leaſt ſhadow of ſin, as death. Then he had a love ſo tender to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his God, that his heart was alwayes as a flaming lamp, that burnt perpetually before the Sanctuary of the living Lord. His faith had a boſome as large, as that of eternity, his hope was as the bow of Heaven, ail furniſht with Emralds, which can never looſe its force, more than they their luſter, and ſo his piety muſt of neceſſity have been an eternal ſource of bleſſings. His care to gather, together ſo many
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170384:99"/>
living-ſtones, for the edification of Gods houſe, (that is to ſay, ſo many good, godly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men) has been more than all theirs, that have heapt together ſo many dead ones, in ſtately piles of Temples. Finally, his whole heart, we know, was perpetually towards God; his feet were ever walking towards the Church, or his other devout retirements: his armes were perpetually employed in all manly and pious exerciſes, and works of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and his whole body, was moſt dutifully diſpoſed to the ſacrifices and victims of his ſoul; and both his ſoul, and body, with all his faculties, were a conſtant Holocauſt to the Lord: Inſomuch, that neither all the cares and confuſions of this World, nor multiplicity of affairs, that he has been ever involved in, have been at all able to withdraw any part, or parcel of him, from the courſe of true piety; but he has alwayes appeared in the midſt of all thoſe encombrances, as thoſe ſweet Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains (which we read of) that are found in the ſalt-ſea, or thoſe happy fiſhes, that do ſtill preſerve their plump white ſubſtance, freſh and free from the infection of all the brackiſh waters that they live in: his pious ſpirit could be never ſo much diſturbed, as to be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht, or taken off, from the refreſhment of his devotions; as we ſhall ſee more at large in our next Aſcent, and happy Parallel.</p>

            <p>By the ſame powerful means, does he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the great anger of the Lord, kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own rebellious people, for their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent murmurings and clamorous repinings againſt himſelf, and his ſervant <hi>Moſes,</hi> impute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtantly no leſſe than murder, baſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170384:100"/>
and malitious deſigns, unto him: yet for all that, the Lord confers nothing but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles upon them, at the importunity of our <hi>Moſes</hi> his prayers. And firſt, he makes bitter waters ſweet, for ſuch unſavory ſinners,<note place="margin">Exod. 15. Exod. 16.

In ſhort, our <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> prevailed ſo often with his prayers, to mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie the Lords diſpleaſure againſt them, that one would think that reades the Story, there had been a vy, between mercies, and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, and a ſharp contention between the Lord, and them, whether they ſhould offend, or he forgive ofteneſt.</p>
            <p>Then ſee the unnatural ſedition of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Aaron,</hi> and his companion <hi>Miriam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 12.</note> and her leproſie cured by his prayer: But there is one thing yet, that we may well inſtance in for all, when the peoples inveterateneſſe in ſin, had added idolatry, to all their other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obediences, and made themſelves worſe than beaſts, in rendering the honours due to God alone, to a pitiful creature of their own make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a gay Golden Calf forſooth; and the Lord was ſo highly offended with them, that he would have utterly deſtroyed them all for it: then our <hi>Moſes</hi> betook himſelf again to this his tryed weapon of prayer, and openly
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170384:101"/>
aſſaults the Lord ſo with his cloſe arguments, expoſtulations,<note place="margin">Exod. 32.11.</note> and importunities, as if he had been fencing with him, beſeeching him, after this moſt earneſt, and humble manner, <hi>Lord, why doth thy wroth wax hot againſt thy people,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And when the Lord was angerly reſolved at another time utterly to extirpate the people, for their inceſſant rebellions, <hi>Moſes</hi> made ſuch another,<note place="margin">Num. 14.</note> though ſomething longer, yet no leſſe effectual, prayer, to the Lord for them, and the Lord, as if he had been able to deny his <hi>Moſes</hi> nothing, or as if (with reverence be it ſpoken) good <hi>Moſes</hi> his word, had been a Law unto him, he preſently replied, <hi>I have pardoned them according to thy word</hi>: nay, how often has the Lord deſired <hi>Moſes</hi> to let him alone, as if he had been ſtruggling with him, and tyr'd with

               <p>By ſo much as has been ſhewed in our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, of our <hi>Moſes</hi> his happy power in prayer, I doubt not, but it does plainly appear, how great a preſervation it was, to that perverſe people, to have a Prince and Captain over them, that had ſo familiar an addreſſe unto God: and I hope it will never more be called in queſtion, by any knowing Chriſtian, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Divine gift of prayer, be a qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170384:102"/>
equal to the dignity, or requiſite to the profeſſion of a Prince? though I know, ſome of our Modern Politicks, have impiouſly gone about to diſpute that too; whom for ſhame I ſhall forbear to name, though I'le be bold to give the World, the ungodly words of one of the Principal of them. <hi>Non ſuadeo Principi, ſtupenda in fanis latitatione, neglectis iis quorum cura eum maxime ſolicitum tenere debet, omne otium conterere, aut ſanctuli nomen, geſtuſve af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectare: bonus animus gratiſſimus Deo cultus eſt: &amp; optimè orat, qui officio gnaviter functus patriae in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>columitatem procur averit, unde tot hominum ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus dependet,</hi> &amp;c. Now, not to trouble you with a literal tranſlation (for I hold the words not worth it) he tells us, That he would not have a Prince addicted to too much De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; nor to affect to be a little Saint: he ſayes his prayers beſt (quoth he) that does his buſineſſe happilieſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is in my opinion, a very pitiful, vain, and a falſe preſumption, that this Gentleman makes, and never indeed can be brought into queſtion, by any diſcreet, or ſober Chriſtian, whether a Prince ſhould be ſo addicted to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, as to intend no other buſineſſe at all? that were a madneſſe in any private perſon, much more then muſt it be in any man that is concerned in the publick: for beſides the inconſiſtency of ſuch a Devotion, with every mans particular vocation, (which God has commanded likewiſe to be followed) it is altogether in its own ſelf, unacceptable to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170384:102"/>
God: Otherwiſe we ſhould enter into Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as if we were to be lifted upon a rack, to be tortured; and I ſay beſides, it is an injury to the Lord himſelf, to think, there can be no true piety or devotion in the World, if our bodies be not torne in pieces, and our ſpirits quite beaten down. And therefore <hi>Gilbertus</hi> a great Doctor, writing upon that ſentence of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Crinthians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Doctor <hi>Gilbertus.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Glorificate &amp; portate Deum in Corpore veſtro,</hi> Glorifie and bear God in your bodies, makes this moſt elegant, and remarkable obſervation: <hi>You muſt bear Jeſus Chriſt, not drag him, Portari vult Chriſtus non trahi,</hi> So he proceeds, <hi>Non eſt foenum Chriſtus, ſed flos campi, &amp; faſciculus mirrhae, inter ubera ſponſae,</hi> &amp;c. Now, he plainly drags him, who makes himſelf ſurcharged with him, and who indiſcreetly afflicts himſelf in the ſervice that he rendereth to the Divine Majeſty, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that Jeſus Chriſt is the flower of the field, or the poeſie of mirrh, between the breaſts of the Spouſe, and not a load of hay, to be drawn, under which we muſt needs groan, like a wheel ill-greaſed.</p>
               <p>This was ſo fooliſh a ſuperſtition, and ſo old a one, that the Philoſopher himſelf, a Pagan,<note place="margin">Senec. Epiſt. <hi>114.</hi>
                  </note> could not but find fault with, when he ſaid, <hi>Superſtitio amandos timet, quos colit, violat.</hi> It is a very fond ſuperſtition indeed, ſaith this wiſe Pagan, and raiſed by ſimple people one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which through a groſſe errour, fears, what it ſhould love by vertue, and very ſcarcely can have any knowledge of, or approach to God,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170384:103"/>
but by violating his Clemency (a thing moſt hateful to him) through a falſe preſumption of his ſeverity. They muſt be very ſilly ſouls indeed, and have very little or no feeling of the Divinity, that can apprehend God (whom we know to be infinitely merciful) to be as terrible as a Minos, or a Radamanthus, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in poetical Fables, who were alwayes repreſented in thoſe fictions, to be moſt ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deities, to come and pry into all humane actions, to number all mens ſteps, and taking pleaſure to prepare puniſhments for them, were wont to raiſe themſelves Trophies, upon poor mens ruines.</p>
               <p>It would be a very pretty piece of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, one would think, now to be preached, That devotion, and all labours in Religion, ſhould be undertaken by us, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation, perpetual diſturbances undergone by Chriſtians, without any repoſe, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries without any remedy, or comfort at all. Sure this muſt be thought the extreme of all extremes; and yet our Modern Politicks will ſuppoſe, ſo ſottiſh a devotion as this, that they may the better lay their foundation, of a wretched incuriouſneſſe in Religion, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane neglect of that Divine duty. But I muſt not make it my buſineſſe now, to enter the liſts formally, with that ſort of people (who we know are accuſtomed upon all occaſions, to throw dirt in the very face of the Deity it ſelf) for I have another way to go at preſent, and ſo will haſten to our Parallel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:170384:103"/>For my part, I am fully ſatisfied, and ſo I hope, will be every diſcreet and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtian, that the frequent exerciſe of prayer, is as neceſſary to a Prince, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or Stateſman, for the well management of all affairs, as it is for an animal to breath. The ſpirit of the beſt man, we know, is no otherwiſe than as a Sun-Dial, which is of no uſe at all, but when the Sun reflects upon it. Nor can any Prince, or Stateſman in like manner expect, that his underſtanding ſhould receive any true light or direction for the government of people, if not enlightned with the true rayes of God: and that light is not to be had, but by the means of prayer: The practiſe therefore of this holy duty, has been ever ſtiled, and eſteemed by the holy Fathers of the Church, The Key of Heaven, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Hell, the Standard of our Chriſtian warfare, the conſervation of our peace, the bridle of our impatience, the guardian of our temperance, the ſeal of chaſtity, the advocate of offenders, the conſolation of the afflicted, the paſſe-port of the dying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Juſt do live and dye in prayer, as the Phoenix in her perfumes. A Chriſtian doubtleſſe without prayer, is no more than a Bee without a ſting, which can neither make honey, nor wax. From the defect of this duty, have proceeded all the deſolations of the earth: from hence are day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly derived ſo many falls, ſo many miſeries; for that men will not apply themſelves to taſt the things of God, in prayer, as our glorious
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170384:104"/>
Patriarch, and his Parallel have alwayes done.</p>
               <p>No man living can deny ſure, but that it was the perpetual preſervation of the children of Iſrael, that their <hi>Moſes</hi> had that happy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to its perfection; for it is manifeſt, that they had otherwiſe been ſwallowed up, by the Divine vengeance; and in ſtead of being brought to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they had been fearfully cut off from the land of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
               <p>I hope it is already made as evident, in our paſt Parallels, that we have received as great Deliverances, and preſervations, by the means of our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> which could never have been, but by his free, frequent, and powerful, acceſſes to God in prayer; as I ſhall ſhew more at large preſently. In the mean time, I will be bold from theſe two great patterns of piety, to draw a cloſing Corollary, and lay down the whole ſtate of the queſtion (if it may be worthy to be called one) in one ſingle naked Propoſition.</p>
               <p>Every good Prince, being a publick Perſon, and charged with ſo important affairs, that depend wholly upon Providence, and expect the motion of the Divine will, ought, after theſe two grand exemplars of Piety and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, to conſider, That he is to hold a great deal of commerce with Heaven, where his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe ſo much lies; and therefore ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, to ſet apart according to the proportion of his time, and other occaſions, ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal

hours, (of leiſure, ſhall I ſay, or buſineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at leaſt) of retirement, to negotiate with God particularly about his government: in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſay, of theſe two greateſt Stateſmen, our firſt and ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> who had ſo familiar a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Almighty, that as the one was, ſo the other, for ought I know, may be, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, The friend of God. O matchleſſe Title!</p>
               <p>His moſt incomparable Piety, knew ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, what <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> tells us, <hi>That if we are to have the Lord in our minds ſo often as we do breath, How much more ſuitable it is, to a Stateſman, to be converſant in that holy duty, having moſt need to ſuck in the life-giving ſpirit, as from the Fountain of the Word, by the means of prayer.</hi> It is not therefore unfitly ſtiled, The ſpirit of prayer; for it is the breath of the inward-man. <hi>Os meum aperui,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, <hi>&amp; attraxi ſpiritum</hi>; I opened my mouth, and drew in the ſpirit. We are all ready to be choaked with fleſh and fat, and to be devoured with flames of concupiſcence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we upon all occaſions, open our mouths to take in that gentle air of God.</p>
               <p>By this bleſſed means it was, that our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Paire, our firſt and ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> have arrived at this great perfection: to whom, the Lord has vouchſafed ſo much of his familiarity, as to treat with them as friends, and to declare himſelf (as it were) unable to deny them any thing.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt, we have ſeen enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170384:105"/>
in ſacred Story, and for our glorious ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> our own manifold obſervations, and frequent experimental knowledges, may be ſufficient to inform us. For that his late moſt Serene Highneſſe had the purity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of this precious ſpirit, is not onely manifeſt, to thoſe that have had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be preſent at his daily ſpreading of his hands, and pouring forth of his ſpirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and to joyn with him in his Devotions; but to the whole Nation, except the moſt ſtupid, and malitious part of it, that either will not, or cannot, be ſenſible of the great benefits, that we have for ſo long a time received by his powerful addreſſes unto God. How many times has the Divine vengeance been diverted from falling upon our ſinful heads, by his importunate interceſſions? How many peſtilences, famines, and other plagues, (which our impenitency, hardneſſe of heart, and ugly ingratitude, had as well deſerved, as either the curſed Egyptians, or murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iſraelites) have been kept off from us, by his means? Has he leſſe often than the former <hi>Moſes,</hi> conquered his enemies, more by his own prayers, than his ſouldiers armes? Has he not by that means obtained (as we have ſeen) a ſecret vertue, to be faſtened to his Standards? making windes and tempeſts to fight under his Enſign, that we may almoſt cry out with the Poet,<note place="margin">Claud.</note> 
                  <hi>O nimium dilecte Deo,</hi> &amp;c. How often has he opened, as aforeſaid, Lands inacceſſible, calmed ſtormy Seas, taken
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170384:105"/>
Towns impregnable, and with petit handfuls of men, diſcomfited huge Armies? How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have we ſeen him (give me leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate thoſe wonders) cleaving of Rocks, hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through Mountains, and to do the works of Gyants, with the reputed Pygmes of the World, and find facility in all that humane reaſon conceived impoſſible? And how, I ſay again, could all this be, but that the Lord could no more deny any thing to the prayer of this his dear ſervant, and favourite, our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, than he could to the former <hi>Moſes?</hi> His fair ſoul, was no whit leſſe elevated upon the pitch of higheſt contemplations, from his very infancy, than the former great <hi>Moſes</hi> was. His high ſoul, was not unlike that Ibis, the ſtately bird of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that always builds her neſt in Palmes: So it was perpetually converſant in high contemplations, and had no more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of earth, than the ſupream Sphere of celeſtial Bodies. Or elſe, more truly yet, reſembling the Palme-tree it ſelf, where that brave Bird builds, which as it is the talleſt and ſtreighteſt of all trees, ſo beares its beſt, and moſt ſolid ſtrength on its top: So had our moſt gracious Protector, and ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> all his vigour alwayes in God, and for God. His life was a perpetual Sabbath, <hi>Sabathum delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> a delicious Sabbath, as the Prophet calls it, nouriſhing, and repoſing his ſoul, with the conſtant draught of this holy ſpirit of prayer. He made it not onely his lock and key of the day, but his bolt of the night; nor onely ſo,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170384:106"/>
but his very meales, and recreations; and all that, his Highneſſe did, more in a becoming ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, than any exteriour oſtent, reſembling thoſe Rivers which run under the earth, chooſing to ſteale from the eyes of the world, to ſeek for the ſight of his God onely; So his Devotions did ever ſtudy ſolitude and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements, and were alwayes beſt, when ſhut up within themſelves.</p>
               <p>Nay, farther yet, after the example of a greater than <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf, he uſed to ſpend many whole nights in prayer, <hi>pernoctans in oratione,</hi> as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreſſeth it: and like thoſe beſt of Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Luc.</note> in the Primitive times, that were called the Crickets of the night, becauſe at any time, if ſome interruption of ſleep hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, they ever made it out, with ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory prayers, and elevations of the heart. Thoſe that love God truly, will have recourſe to him, at all hours, and upon all occaſions, not confining their devotions to time, or place. <hi>Jonas,</hi> and the three Children, found ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Chappels, in the Whales belly, and the fiery Furnace, becauſe the love of God, the wiſeſt Architect, had erected them, and the Lord was as near them, in the intrails of a Fiſh, or the midſt of Flames, as he would have been, in his own moſt holy Temple.</p>
               <p>In fine, our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> has not onely reacht after the former, as we have already ſeen, but he has ſum'd up all example, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect himſelf in the practiſe of this Divine duty.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170384:106"/>
He ever diſtributed his faſtings, watchings, prayer, repaſt, counſel, ſtudy, with ſo pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent an oeconomy, for the ſervice of his God, and held his life ſo admirably interlaced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween action, and contemplation, that he made on earth, a perfect figure of Angels aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending, and deſcending, receiving already a taſt of thoſe benefits, which he was to hope for, in the other; inſomuch, that he ſeemed to have his ſoul in Heaven, whilſt he was on earth, to underſtand myſteries, and enjoy an antipaſt of Paradiſe it ſelf. O thrice, and four times happy were we, if we could have, known our own happineſſe, to have had ſuch a Perſon ſet over us, by God, and his own Divine vertues, that had ſo clear and free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to the Throne of Grace, and ſo near an union to God himſelf, as a finite was capable of, with an infinite, and might be ſtiled, as the former <hi>Moſes</hi> was, The familiar friend of God, and was not onely alwayes ready, to ſtand in the gap, between us, and the Divine vengeance, as the firſt <hi>Moſes</hi> did; but was wont to ſtorm Heaven for us, and pull down bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings by force upon us, though we were a moſt ungrateful, and undeſerving people; nor ſo onely, but that was alwayes ready to inſtruct us by his precept, as well as practiſe, if we could dare to follow him, in all other pieces of Piety, and Divine duty; as we have in part ſeen already, and ſhall more at large in the next ſucceeding Aſcents, and Parallels.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>MOſes</hi> was a moſt exemplary Perſon, in all the practical parts of true Piety; He had alwayes ſo reverend, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a feeling of the Majeſty of God, as not to ſerve him, with exteriour ſhews, and ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances onely of Religion; but ſincerely, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially,<note place="margin">Sap. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> and conſtantly, <hi>Sentiendo de domino in bonitate,</hi> as the Book of Wiſdom deſcribes it, alwayes thinking on the Lord, with a true good heart.</p>
            <p>This was moſt eminently viſible in the whole current of his thorough Religious life, but principally remarkable in the denial of himſelf, and all his own deſires, when any thing that concerned the glory of his God lay at the ſtake, or was called into the leaſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, ſubmitting alwayes all worldly ends, and humane reluctancies, to the intereſts of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and pure Religion. Was not this, I ſay, firſt notorious in him, when he would hazard the diſoblidgement of his wife (a thing that men ordinarily fear,<note place="margin">Exod. 4.25.</note> more than a diſobedience
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170384:107"/>
to God) nay would incur her diſpleaſure ſo far, as to be thought, and called by her, a cruel hard-hearted perſon, and a bloody hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, rather than omit the performance of one Tittle of his Almighty Maſters commands. Nay, State Policy it ſelf, which now adayes is held to be almoſt inconſiſtent with true Piety, could not hinder his heroick practiſe of piety. And this did moſt manifeſtly appear, in his refuſal of all the favours that <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court,<note place="margin">Exod. 2.</note> or his daughters countenance, could afford him, for the ſervice of his God, poſtponing every thing of his own affection and intereſts, to the zeal for his Religion, and the quiet of a good conſcience. This is, I ſay, a moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able piece of Princely piety indeed, to hold all the Maxims of State, and proper intereſts whatſoever, under the rules of Religion, and Conſcience, and to be diſpoſed, rather to hazard all, than to loſe God by one ſole ſin. This noble Princely piece of piety, to its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, both of profeſſion, and practiſe, our great Patriarch ſhewed in the whole courſe of his life, loudly proclaiming, and as ſtrictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, to love the Lord God,<note place="margin">Exod. Num. Levit. Deut.</note> with the whole heart, and him onely to ſerve, which no man can do, that mixeth any thing of humane, with divine obligations; that is but to ſerve God by pieces.</p>

               <p>We have alreay gone far in the diſcourſe of our great Patriarchs, and his happy Parallel's, moſt Princely and exemplary piety; clearly to be collected from the viſible zeal, they ever bore to Gods glory, and devotions to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but all this, may be ſaid to be (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is in moſt of this Age) but a meer out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide onely, the very heart and marrow of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion conſiſting in the interiour, which we can make no other judgement of, than by the apparent practiſe of piety, true godly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious lives of men, and a dutiful ſubmiſſion of all humane intereſt, to God; and if all this, were ever eminent in any Perſons, it has been in theſe two great Princes, our firſt and ſecond <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is very obſervable, that all this Princely practiſe of true piety, is but an effect, or conſequent at leaſt, of that zeal to Gods glory, before ſpoken of, and of that precious ſpirit of prayer;<note place="margin">Thom.

All this, holy <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> the Oracle of the Latine Church, recites out of that Heathen, to teach us faith from the Philoſophy of the moſt perfidious, and Religion, from the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the moſt irreligious man that ever lived: juſt as if an honeſt man, ſhould pull a thing ſtolne, out of a Theeves coffer.

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170384:109"/>
go buzzing up and down with their empty prayers, and yet neither make honey, nor wax. To what purpoſe, in the mean time, is it, to be <hi>Vox, &amp; praeterea nihil?</hi> to warble like a Nightingale, or a well-touch'd Lute, and to be deaf to all harmony?

               <p>We ſhould march in our Chriſtian warfare, like the brave ſouldiers of <hi>Gideon,</hi> with the torch in our hands, as well as the Trumpet on our lips: and therefore it was ſaid of the great and holy <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> that his voice was a Thunderclap, and his life a Lightning flaſh: and truly words, let them be never ſo good, can never thunder well, if the living example enlighten not.</p>
               <p>All which, our moſt gracious late Protector, and ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> knew full well, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed accordingly, in imitation of his great Maſter, the firſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> our Princely Patriarch, who was not onely ready to exerciſe his holy ſpirit of prayer, in the behalf of, and for his people, but alſo to make practiſe of his piety before them, to inflame their lives to holineſſe
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170384:109"/>
and charity, as well as to preſerve their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in peace, and plenty; to be active in his obedience to the Almighties will, as well as outwardly zealous for his glory.</p>
               <p>Now, by this onely it is plain, that our firſt and ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> have clearly been of a quite contrary Religion, to <hi>Machiavel,</hi> before cited,<note place="margin">Mach. Princ. c. <hi>2.</hi> Decad. c. <hi>12.13.</hi>
                  </note> and all his Crew, who would have a Prince, or Stateſman, practiſe Religion, onely according to the neceſſity of their affairs, and to learn how they may ſometimes be wicked, that is, to make ſhew of Religion, and honeſty, ſo far forth as may ſerve their turns; but in very deed, to be compleat knaves.</p>
               <p>Every man in power forſooth, muſt be a Hypocrite, his face alwayes maskt, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard too, ought to be more lovely, than the viſage, he muſt make his apparencies better than his ſubſtance, and court opinion, more than conſcience. O rare <hi>Machiavillian</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinty, and very pious policy! But our Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch <hi>Moſes,</hi> (a wiſer man ſure, than a million of <hi>Machiavels</hi>) we find, was clean of another opinion, as well as practiſe too; he underſtood ſufficiently, how the Lord Almighty had ever reproved, condemned, and chaſtiſed, with a moſt particular indignation of his heart, that abominable plaiſtered kind of life in Princes, as well as common people; and therefore he ordered in his Law, that the Swan, and the Oſtrich, ſhould never be made uſe of, in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Sacrifices.<note place="margin">Levit. 11.18.</note> Upon which Moſaical ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, all the Interpreters of Scripture, are
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170384:110"/>
joyntly of opinion, that the Swan was firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, notwithſtanding the whiteneſſe of her feathers, and ſweetneſſe of note, ſo much aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to her; becauſe under thoſe pure white plumes, ſhe hides ſo black a fleſh. Then for the Oſtrich, which carries onely an oſtentuous boaſt of fair large wings, and very little or no flight at all, ſhe could never be admitted into the number of Divine victims: ſo much the Lord abhors apparencies, fruitleſſe, and effectleſſe.</p>
               <p>Now, I would very fain know of all thoſe piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Politicians, who purſue like <hi>Machiavillian</hi> Maxims, with ſuch corrupt hypocritical ſpirits, as the <hi>Florentine</hi> propoſeth, what they will anſwer me further upon this Aſcent of our <hi>Moſes,</hi> and his Parallel? For the firſt, it is clear, that if he had been to chooſe and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, onely a Religion, that ſuited beſt with State policy, or temporal deſigns, it had been much more prudence in him, to have joyned himſelf with the Religion of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to have been aſſociated with the Magicians themſelves, than to have kept ſo cloſe to the Commandments of God. And if he had been to value his private intereſt, before his honeſty, and conſcience, ſure the powerful favours of a great Kings Court, and more inticing importunities of a Princeſſe, would have been greater attractives to his ambition, than a poor, ſimple, Shepherds life, in a Deſart.</p>
               <p>Nay, before we approach our precious
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170384:110"/>
Parallel <hi>Moſes,</hi> what can they, I mean the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples of that wiſe Secretary, ſay, to another glorious Countryman of ours, one of the moſt Chriſtian, and Victorious Princes, that ever ſwayed a Scepter, and that was <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great? Firſt we ſhall find upon a clear account, twelve or thirteen great Perſons, at that very time, all arguing upon the Diadem of the Empire with him.

If uſe muſt be made of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion onely as of an Inſtrument of State, and that alone to be taken up, which hath the greateſt vogue, and credit, in the opinion of the people, be it right, or wrong; Why went he about then to fix himſelf upon Chriſtian Religion, and at that very time, when the greateſt part of the World, was ingulpht in Gentiliſme?</p>

Could he look for counſel amongſt them? they were men of no eſteem at all in the World, and thought utterly void of all learning and policy. Was it any credit, that he could expect they might confer upon his Cauſe? they were moſt deſpicable creatures, and trampled underfoot by every body, like dirt in the ſtreets, reputed meer <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Well might they then have the reputation of Prophets amongſt the Heathens, who lookt with as much reverence upon the Theogony of <hi>Heſiod,</hi> as we Chriſtians do upon the Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of Jeſus Chriſt; they valued <hi>Homers Illiads</hi> as highly, as we poſſibly can the Books of the Goſpel, and had as great a reſpect to the <hi>Apothegm</hi>'s of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> as we can have to the Commandments of God.</p>
               <p>Let them paſſe on then with their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Prophets ſtill, eſpecially ſince St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, is pleaſed to afford it to them, ſaying, <gap reason="foreign">

alwayes lyars, evil beaſts, flow bellies: then aſſerts their witneſſe to be true, and that is rare indeed for Poets, one would think.</p>
               <p>Well, a moſt Noble, and inſpired faculty, yea Propheſie it ſelf, let Poetry be; for truly, I think, a man may be born to one, as well as the other: But, what is this to our late Great Protector, who never dealt in any ſuch trivial Arts, ſay ſome of our <hi>Miſomuſi</hi>? No, my Lord never eſteemed that honourable, and illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Art full of Divine fury, after that manner, though it may be, his greater occupations could not permit him the practiſe of it: he ever had a moſt reverent eſteem of ſo Divine a profeſſion, when regulated after the true Divine way, and was a moſt magnificent <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caenas</hi> to its profeſſors.</p>
               <p>For the Profeſſion,<note place="margin">Ariſtot. Bembus.

               <p>Then for the Profeſſours, Was there ever a more bountiful Benefactor, than he has been to all the vertuous perſons of it? To inſtance in one for all; What obliging favours has he caſt upon our <hi>Engliſh Virgil</hi> here (I mean Mr. <hi>Edm. Waller</hi>) and meerly for that, and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues, having in ſome other relations, little capacity enough to deſerve them. My Lord has ſufficiently ſhewed his own moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170384:120"/>
judgement in Poetry, by his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and election of him, to be the object of his great goodneſſe, who is clearly one of the ableſt, and moſt flouriſhing wits, that ever handled a pen, and he does it, with that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural dexterity and promptneſſe, as if he had begun to write, ſo ſoon as to live; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever confiders the worth of his Writings, cannot but wonder, how ſo many graces and beauties, which others labour for, and never attain to, encreaſe in him, as in a ſoil natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for wit and eloquence; If he goes about to tranſlate any thing, the dead Authors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are ready to riſe out of their graves, and requeſt him to exchange his Engliſhed Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, for their Originals. In all his own things, his conceptions are unimitable, his language ſo ſweet and polite, that no Ice can be ſmoother; his ſentences are alwayes full of weight, his arguments of force, and his words glide along like a river, and bear perpetually in them, ſome flaſhes of lightning, at the end of each period. He perfectly knows how to vary his eloquence upon all occaſions, to be facetious in pleaſing arguments, grave in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, polite in laborious, and when the ſubject requires fervor and invective, his mouth can ſpeak tempeſts; In ſhort, he is the wonder of Wits, the pattern of Poets, the mirrour of Orators in our Age. All this I ſay of him, not ſo much out of deſign to applaud him, as to adore the judgement of our great <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who alwayes choſe him out, and crowned
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170384:120"/>
him for the <hi>Virgil</hi> of this Nation; but his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours likewiſe were extended moſt liberally, to all thoſe that did deſerve them, either here, or in either of his Univerſities: He was a perfect <hi>Philomuſus,</hi> and why not by that, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for a Poetical Prophet? the father ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, at leaſt, or ought to have, an equal por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the children of the Prophets.</p>
               <p>And ſo I paſſe to the ſecond ſort of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that is, of our Prudent and Political ones, commonly called Stateſmen, who indeed muſt foreſee futurities too, or they can never order their affairs aright; for if they look not into all caſualties of inconvenience, how ſhall they be ever able to prevent them? And <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> very wiſely forewarns all Stateſmen,<note place="margin">Senec. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. <hi>24.</hi>
                  </note> of the neceſſity of this foreſight of all futurities, when he tells them, that they are bound <hi>Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid fieri poteſt, quaſi futurum cogitare,</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that all things may, that can come to paſſe.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that Learned <hi>Jew,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joſeph de Bell Jud. l. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> tells us moſt judiciouſly alſo, that <hi>Bonum eſt, dum adhuc ſtat navis in portu, praecavere tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatem futuram, &amp; non eo tempore, quo in medias irrueris procellas, trepidare:</hi> It is neceſſary for him that goes to Sea, to foreſee a ſtorm coming, if he can, and not to ruſh into the fury of the Seas; and tremble at the tempeſt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; that will a vail little, but for to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ridiculous for his own raſhneſſe.</p>
               <p>This holds altogether as true in him, that holdes the Helme of a Kingdom, or Common-wealth,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170384:121"/>
as in any Pilot of a Ship whatſoever. By this it may be collected, how hugely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it is for a Prince, or Supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, to hold a conſtant communication with God, without whoſe Divine aſſiſtance, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to manage State matters well, as we have partly ſhewed already: by his Divine inſpirations onely it muſt be, that they can propheſie upon affairs, as they ſhould.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Xenoph. de inſtit. Cyr.</note>Therefore that great Stateſman <hi>Xenophon,</hi> who drew ſo well the portraiture of a perfect Empire, tells us, that <hi>Tam erit arduum pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribere quae facienda ſunt, quam futura omnia praeſcire, quod ſolius Dei eſt, &amp; majus conditione mortali</hi>: It is as difficult to preſcribe what is to be done in State-buſineſſes, as to foreknow all futurities, which is proper to God alone, and above the reach of all Mortals: and yet this, that is ſo hard a task, is impoſed upon Princes: So that great Statiſt proceeds, <hi>Ecce aliquid Dei, ſic Princeps ſuſtinebit, in ventura ſcilicet excurrere, qui ut ſibi conſtet, ſufficiatque, primum conſiliis &amp; conatibus ſuis, à Deo fulcrum prudentiae &amp; ſapientiae jugiter flagitabit, nam illa quae capite humano tantum ſtat, infirma eſt &amp; incauta quaedam temeritas, ad nullam autem Provinciam erit inhabilis, ad nullam virtutem indocilis, qui pietatem didicerit, numiniſque cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> Behold here, ſaith he, how a Prince muſt of neceſſity have more than ordinary of God in him, to have an inſight into the events of things, and to diſcourſe upon futurities; which true ſpirit of propheſie, that he may
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170384:121"/>
have, that he may be conſtant to himſelf, and ſtable in his counſels, he is perpetually to ſeek that capacity, and ſupport from God; for the greateſt wit of man, of it ſelf, will be nothing but temerity; but he that is a true ſervant of Gods, and delights in his worſhip, ſhall be ſo inſpired, as to be able to encounter all extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of State, and difficulties of affaires whatſoever.</p>
               <p>It were now to be wiſht, that our Chriſtian Kings and Princes, would ſtudy and practiſe ſome of theſe religious Pagans admirable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, though they will not ſtrive to mount up our Moſaical Aſcents, as his late moſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Highneſſe has done, by which he has arrived, as we have ſeen, to the perfection of this Political ſpirit of propheſie.</p>
               <p>The wiſe Philoſopher aſſures us,<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piens non ſemper it uno gradu, ſed una via</hi>: A prudent perſon, keeps not alwayes one pace, though ſtill one and the ſame way, by which way, he muſt unqueſtionably mean, this Divine and prophetick way, this way of dependance upon God, in all his counſels; for no way elſe can be one, all humane wayes being various and uncertain, as has been ſufficiently ſhewed in our precedent diſcourſes, together with my Lords, our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> his, as the firſts great relations to the Lord in all their affairs; ſo I may hold my hand now, from any further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement upon their prophetical Policies: but conclude, that his late Highneſſe, was a moſt compleat Prophet in this ſenſe alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:170384:122"/>So now, we come to the third and laſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Prophets, and that is the true one indeed, the Divine Prophets, I mean, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately illuminated by God, as our firſt <hi>Moſes</hi> was, and had free and frequent converſation with the Deity, even to the enjoyment of him face to face.</p>
               <p>Of this ſort of Prophets, we find a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction likewiſe in Scripture, and they are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Spirit of God, either <hi>Videntes,</hi> or <hi>Evangelizantes,</hi> Seers, or Preachers: The Seers were thoſe which uſed to converſe with God by Viſions, or Divine Dreams, and to have ſome miraculous Revelations of things, and many future Events. This truly is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per high pitch of propheſie, the ſublimeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſure, that mortality can arrive at, and that, our firſt <hi>Moſes</hi> had in the greateſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any meer man that ever lived, as we have ſeen in our Aſcent; nor truly dare I venture our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> here, to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Parallel with him; for, as I have ſaid before, we are yet unknowing to thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular private diſpenſations of Heaven to him, though this we may ſecurely conclude, as the Scripture ſpeaks, <hi>that the Secret of the Lord was with him; and that he had the teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> which to have, is to have the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie; for the teſtimony of Jeſus, is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of propheſie,<note place="margin">Revel. 19.10.</note> as is expreſſely delivered to us in the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then for the ſecond ſort of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which are the <hi>Evangelizers,</hi> or inſpired
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170384:122"/>
                  <hi>Preachers,</hi> they are ſuch as the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes at large, in the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth, Chapters of his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>: and exhorts us all,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. Ib. 13. ib. 14.</note> to covet to be, above all things, and to ſpeak unto men, <hi>to edification, to exhortation, and comfort.</hi> Now if ever this ſublime Piece of Divine propheſie, was made out to any mortal man, of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, it was moſt eminently glorious in him: his very life was a perpetual Propheſie, his ſanctified example, was a conſtant living Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and the words which the Spirit gave him, when he was pleaſed to open his inſpired lips, were, as we have hinted before, as thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derclaps to Hindes, for the production of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>His way of propheſying, was not like theirs now adayes, that make a trade of it, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their Pulpits more for coin, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and to pluck the fruits of the earth from their Pariſhioners, than to improve the fruits of the Spirit in them: No, his inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Highneſſe ever hated that canker of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirits, ſo predominate in the moſt preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Prophets of this Age, who indeed more zealouſly preach themſelves, and their own vile intereſts, than the pure and ſaving word of God.</p>
               <p>Others forſooth, there are of them, that will preach nothing but <hi>placentia,</hi> ſow pillows under ſinful elbows, and ſtroak and tickle their Auditors in the meane time with ſtrange ſtories, or vain curioſities, and yet
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170384:123"/>
this they will call propheſying; but be it what it will, they care not, ſo it be for their own profiting; and they have brought a great part of the people too, to be ſatisfied with that kind of ſtuff; nay, even ſtrangely to delight in it.</p>
               <p>The generality now, comes onely to hear Preachers, as of old they uſed to do to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian</hi> Orators, or a curious Lute-player, or a Comedy: but if he that preacheth has no other intention but to pleaſe, and they that hear, have no other purpoſe, but to ſooth their own curioſity, he may weary his lungs in the mean ſpace, and they hug the itch in their ears; but the time will come, when he ſhall have the worm in his heart, to gnaw him, and they the tingling of the eares for their puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The ſeller, and the buyer, both ſhall be payed home with the coin of reprobation; for whoſoever ſpeaketh not, and who heareth not, to do, and become better, abuſeth the gift of propheſie it ſelf, and a word ſigned with the blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the account of which, they will find ineſtimable, and the loſſe of the leaſt jot of it, moſt damnably dangerous.</p>
               <p>His inſpired Highneſſe, I ſay, out of his true Prophetick wiſdom,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.2.</note> ever hated the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of all thoſe giddy ungodly Evangelizers, and ſaid with holy <hi>Paul, Though I have the gift of Propheſie, and underſtand all myſteries, and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, ſo as I could remove mountains, and have
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170384:123"/>
no charity, I am nothing</hi>: Now this charity tends to that the Apoſtle tells us, (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) <hi>to edification, exhortation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of others,</hi> which his true Prophetick Spirit alwayes obſerved, and by that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed all his people about him ſo, that his Palace alwayes appeared, as a glorious Temple, and his converſation a very Heaven upon Earth: So I hope this Parallel like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe will not be denyed, to be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: Yet we ſhall ſee it more clear in the following.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>MOſes</hi> was not onely endowed by God, with a moſt rich and plentiful ſpirit of Propheſie himſelf; but he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to procure it for, and alwayes permitted the exerciſe of it in, others: nay, encouraged and cheriſhed it in his people, to the diſcontent of divers about him; for the ſacred Text tells us, that when newes was brought to the bleſſed Patriarch, and holy Prophet, that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained two of the men in the Camp, the name of the one was <hi>Eldad,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 11.26.</note> and the name of the other <hi>Medad,</hi> and that the ſpirit reſting upon them, they continued to propheſie in the Camp,<note place="margin">V. 27.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170384:124"/>
Propheſying, and that his judgement too, was ſeconded by Divine approbation; for what he then ſpoke, was from the very mouth, and dictate, of the Spirit of God himſelf.</p>
            <div type="parallel">
               <head>The Parallel.</head>
               <p>Thus we ſee, what Philoſophers aſſure us, is very true, that <hi>Omne bonum eſt ſui diffuſivum,</hi> All good is diffuſive of it ſelf; nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is ſo proper to its nature, as to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable: much more then muſt the Spirit of all goodneſſe be ſo; that is, this Spirit of God himſelf, the Holy Spirit of propheſie; What elſe made our great and gracious Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, ſo willing to part with ſome of his ſpirit, as the Text tells us, he did to the ſeventy,<note place="margin">Num. 11.24.</note> that he ſet round about the Tabernacle? nor onely ſo, but to endeavour, and deſire, as we have ſeen in the Aſcent, That all Gods people were Prophets too, and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them.</p>
               <p>O words worthy to be written in Letters of Gold, with a Pen of Diamond: And was not this the very ſenſe, and true Prophetick Spirit of our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> too? Has he not alwayes endeavoured, to impart that ſpirit of his to, and improve it in, the hearts of all his people, that were capable of it? Has he not alwayes incouraged the free uſe, and exerciſe
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170384:125"/>
of it, throughout theſe Nations, whilſt ſome cruel, greedy, envious, and exterminating ſpirits, were not onely ſtriving in private, but enacting in publick, to make a monopoly of this holy Spirit, and engroſſe it to themſelves? Nor onely ſo, but went about to extirpate, and root out, all thoſe that deſired the free uſe, and exerciſe of it. O Antichriſtain Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rany! But this ſufficiently argued, that theirs was not the true ſpirit of propheſie, neither of, nor from the Lord at all: for that no ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit whatſoever can have a true union with God, that has not a commixture of charity, is evident,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> by the drift of the whole Chapter of that Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> cited in the laſt Parallel.</p>
               <p>From whence then muſt this ſpirit of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe amongſt men proceed, is it from the more brutal part of man? An ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Tertull.</note> in an elegant gradation of his, tells us, no: for <hi>Homo homini Lupus,</hi> A man is a Wolf to a man; that will not reach it; for <hi>Saevis inter ſe convenit</hi>: No beaſt ſo ſavage, that will prey upon his own kinde. Is it from any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſhneſſe that may poſſeſſe humane nature? no, <hi>Homo homini daemon,</hi> will not reach it; for thoſe wicked ſpirits do agree well enough within themſelves; for our Saviour himſelf, teſtifies of their union, when he ſayes, <hi>That if their houſe were divided, it could not ſtand.</hi> From whence then can this ſpirit of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe amongſt men proceed? even from men themſelves, <hi>Homo homini homo,</hi> That alone

               <p>From whence then muſt this ſpirit of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe amongſt Chriſtians proceed? is it from any principle of faith, or primitive practiſe? ſurely no: for the firſt children, of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, bore neither rod nor ſtick in their hands, wherewithal to plant faith in the hearts of men: How comes it to paſſe then, that we ſee ſome ſort of people have publiſht a Religion, all briſtled over with ſwords and pikes, all ſooted with the ſmoke of musket and canon, all ſprinkled over, and beſmear'd with the blood of Chriſtians? Muſt now the ancient Armes of our Chriſtian forefathers, which were prayers, and tears, be laid aſide, and none but killing weapons taken up? no Schooles to decide controverſies between Chriſtians, but bloody Campanias, nor way to ſave the ſouls of men, but by deſtroying their bodies? Did God refuſe to have his Temple built by <hi>David,</hi> though a man after his own heart, becauſe onely his hands were bloody; and can he now be contented, to have the very morter that is to bind up the ſtones, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the walls of his Church, be tempered
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170384:126"/>
with blood, and her breaches made up with ſkulls and carkaſes? Will he now ſuffer the ſtones of his houſe, to be all poliſht with ſuch ſtroakes,<note place="margin">1 Kings 6.7.</note> as are ſmitings of Brethren, who would not endure in that of <hi>Solomons</hi> building, ſo much as the noiſe of hammer, ax, or iron, or braſſe toole?</p>
               <p>From whence then can proceed this ſpirit of bitterneſſe amongſt brethren? that the red Dragon ſhould begin again to play Rex, and that Whore prepare to dye her Scarlet anew, and the pale Horſe of impriſonment and exile, threaten a range about the ſtreets? till his late moſt Serene Highneſſe, was pleaſed to oppoſe himſelf and all his power, againſt thoſe cruel, and, as I ſaid before, Antichriſtian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. From whence, I ſay, could ariſe this root of bitterneſſe between Brethren? from nothing but a meer <hi>Machiavillian</hi> trick too, a pretence, forſooth, of conformity, or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in the Church, which has been, and is undoubtedly, the greateſt cheat, that ever the Devil invented, to make men run a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Religion, and to embroile Chriſtendom in direful wars, perpetual confuſions, and moſt bloody ruins.</p>
               <p>The witchcraft of that <hi>Jezebel</hi> it was, that ſo long troubled this our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that our great <hi>Jehu,</hi> as well as ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo furiouſly marcht againſt, and, thanks be to God, has pretty well diſſolved her inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Her painted face, he has now likewiſe diſcovered in its pure naturals, to all the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170384:126"/>
World, and pulled off the vizard of all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſes whatſoever; for let the ends of theſe conformity-mongers, be never ſo plauſible, to ciment the State forſooth, againſt all diviſion, we find it has been throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> the onely mother and nurſe, of all diſturbances whatſoever in matters of Religion, and the greateſt occaſion of civil bloodſhed, that ever was in the World; for there can be no War ſo paſſionate, as the War of conſcience.</p>
               <p>All theſe horrid inconveniences, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, his Highneſſe's great Moſaick prudence, moſt timely lookt into, and prevented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us. How often have we ſeen the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Furnace heating by ſeveral parties? ſo could expect no leſſe than a fiery-trial: But he would neither ſuffer King, nor his Court, though he was the pretended head of that pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Body, nor yet Biſhops, Arch-Deacons, Deans, Chancellors, and Officials, with their long-tailed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor yet any Superintendent with his Claſſes, and pretended Directories, to impoſe any thing upon tender conſciences; and indeed amongſt all the weighty affairs of this Nation, which he like another <hi>Atlas,</hi> ſo happily bore about him, the dear indulgent care, he alwayes expreſt in the favour of ſuch Chriſtians, who laboured under any ſcruples of conſcience, was as glorious and remarkable, as his undaunted courage to pull down his proud and ſtiff-necked enemies: and this is moſt evident likewiſe, by what it pleaſed his moſt Serene Highneſſe to hold forth in the ſame

               <p>O words worthy of the ſpirit of ſo great a Prince and Prophet, which I could dwell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to admire! but I am called now away from that admiration; Yet, in the mean time, I muſt deſire leave to wonder at another Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, With what face theſe uniformity men, be they King, Court, and Council; Prelate, Dean, and Chapter; Preſident, Superintendent, and Conſiſtory; be it Convocation, Synod, or Aſſembly, could preſcribe Rules to other mens faiths, unleſſe they could make clearly out, that very Junto of theirs, call it what you will, to be the onely true Throne of Chriſt, and that they could demonſtrate all the lineaments of their Diſcipline, and Government, to be truly
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170384:128"/>
and naturally derived from the pure Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Gods word: otherwiſe, methinkes, ſuch tyrannous impoſitions ſhould rather af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighten, than ſatisfie mens conſciences, and make them diſclaim ſuch a Religion for a monſter, than accept it for a well-ſhap't child of the Church.</p>
               <p>Is it reaſon for me to run out of my wits, to ſatisfie a company of unreaſonable men, met together? and ſhall I lay the head of my faith upon the block of any Aſſembly, to be cut and mangled into what form and faſhion they ſhall pleaſe? God forbid: But yet I hold it much more madneſſe to perſecute any man becauſe he is not of my opinion; I may as well ſure quarrel with thoſe that reſemble me not in outward complexion: For ſince we loſt perfection in <hi>Adam,</hi> whatever know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we attain to now, is either Moral, by the improving of thoſe natural endowments, God has given us, or elſe Divine, which comes by an immediate influence from Heaven upon the ſoul; therefore when we ſee any weaker in judgement than our ſelves, we ſhould look upon them, rather as objects of pitty, than puniſhment, rather deplorable, than dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
               <p>Vain man, what made the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thee, and thy weak brother? Was it not free grace? <hi>for what haſt thou,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle demands of thee, <hi>that thou didſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive?</hi> and that God may reveale to him alſo, in his due time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:170384:129"/>Is it not a barbarous thing, for people to be ſtript of their lives and goods, for difference in opinions onely, though our brethren ſtill in Chriſt? Nay, to lie under ſo rigid a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, that poor Chriſtians ſhould be made accountable for the very goods that have been violently pulled from them, and tributary for the onely ſhipwrack of their poverty. Nor is this courſe of cruel proceeding in points of Religion, more againſt Piety, than common Policy: for firſt it is as impoſſible to root out any Religion by a perſecution, as to put out a fire, with blowing of it, the ſuffering party alwayes gaining credit to his cauſe, if it be a matter of Conſcience; and therefore we find the Chriſtian Church has alwayes fructified by the blood of Martyrs; and indeed, had no other viſible ſeed-plot, but the places of their executions.</p>
               <p>Then it is not a more common, than true Rule, that <hi>Malus cuſtos diuturnitatis metus, &amp; frequens vindicta paucorum odium reprimit, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium irritat</hi>: Fear is no good Maſter, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent puniſhments, provoke more ill blood, than they do ſuppreſſe. The reaſon is plain, for men that lie under any oppreſſion, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if it be for matter of conſcience, though they are at ſome times poſſibly wiſe and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate enough, doe ordinarily become mad, and uſually trample down all relations, to make way for a deliverance, where they have leaſt hopes given them of a remedy; and as the condition of mens beings alter, ſo they do
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170384:129"/>
moſt commonly vary their intereſts, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
               <p>His Moſaick Highneſſe therefore, would not, (as was ſaid before, of him, that <hi>Cum victor extiterit lictor protinus evaſit</hi>) appear at all ſevere upon Brethren of the ſame Faith, though differing, it may be, in ſome Doctrines: he provided more Doctors, than Executioners for them, knowing that the apprehenſions of God, and true Religion, are to be inſtilled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hearts of men, by the true Spirit of Propheſie, and help of tongues, and not by the dint of ſwords: he knew that God had not in theſe dayes, refuſed his wonted appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in a ſoft voice, and choſen to remain in thunder, as our <hi>Boanerges</hi>'s, would have it now: as alſo he conſidered, that to go about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any thing in Religion, by humane ſtrength, is quite contrary to the nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation it ſelf, and as extravagant a courſe, as to attempt, the repair of a Caſtle-wall with a needle and thread. He never went about to make deciſions of Faith, with the edge of his ſword, or determine controverſies in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by his armour of proof; No, the ſword of the Spirit he knew, did never uſe to make way to the conſcience, by cutting through the fleſh; and he that by force of armes, cruelty, and perſecution, goes about to reform, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend any Religion, doth but take ſuch cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as are condemned by the ſame Religion, that he would defend.</p>
               <p>His Highneſſe therefore, alwayes took a
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170384:130"/>
ſofter and ſecurer courſe, like a true Moſaical Prophet indeed, knowing that the true Spirit of Propheſie, like Amber, ſweetly draws the ſlighteſt ſtraw, and like Adamant, will court and attract, the hardeſt iron: He had obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved likewiſe, what ſome Naturaliſts tell us, That fountains of troubled water, would be cleanſed with a Honey-comb, while vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtirring of them, would but foul them worſe.</p>
               <p>He reflected frequently upon the Speech of <hi>Abner</hi> to <hi>Joab,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 2.26.</note> 
                  <hi>Num uſque ad internecionem hujus macro defaeviet, an ignoras quod periculoſa eſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperatio? uſque quo non dicis populo, ut omittat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequi fratres ſuos?</hi> Shall the Sword devoure forever? Knoweſt thou not, that it is not a little dangerous to drive men into deſpaira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? How long ſhall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from perſecuting their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? An excellent piece of counſel, and as good an example, and was as well followed by his late moſt Serene Highneſſe; He ever held thoſe to be beſt, and moſt godly Laws, that were leaſt ſanguinary, and yet maintained order: all others he accounted meer Phala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmes, and <hi>leges Draconis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though it may be objected, that to give factions the bridle, to entertain and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate new opinions, is the highway to ſcatter contentions, and ſow diviſions amongſt the people, and as it were, to lend them hand to make a diſturbance of the Publick peace, there being no bar or obſtacle of Lawes, to hinder
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170384:130"/>
their courſe; yet it may be as well urged, that to give factions that very bridle, to uphold their opinions, is by that facility and gracious favour, the ready way to mollifie and reform them; at leaſt, to blunt their edge, which would be otherwiſe ſharpned, by rareneſſe, novelty, and difficulty.</p>
               <p>Clemency is a vertue ſometimes of as great policy, as piety, as we have ſhewed in our former Aſcents; becauſe it begets love, and love breeds loyalty, commands the very ſoul, and layes the body at the feet of the obliger. Mercy kindles fire and zeale in the hearts of Subjects, pitty and pardon, as they make the obligation of the offenders greater, ſo it makes them repent, to have offended him, who hath ſo obliged them, the reaſon is infallible, <hi>fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem ſi putaveris facies</hi>; The way to make a faithful friend, is to believe him to be ſo.</p>
               <p>But what has propheſying to do with facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? that good ſpirit ſure, cannot be guilty of making any publick diſturbance, for it is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of peace. Several prophetick ſpirits cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, and diverſities of perſwaſions, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Religion, may live and cohabit together, without deſtruction of one another; and though they come not into one Church, Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Meeting-place, yet may converſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one Market, City, or Common-wealth. <hi>Symmachus</hi> though a Pagan, yet a moſt Learned and Vertuous one, could ſay, in a Speech, that he made to <hi>Theodorick, That in matter of Religion, every man ought to have
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170384:131"/>
his rights and ceremonies, as his opinion, free,</hi> and gives his reaſon thus: <hi>God is a great Secret, no wonder therefore if we endeavour to find him, ſo many ſeveral wayes.</hi> And <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> though a very good Chriſtian, profeſt in a ſolemn Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Not to force any man in his Religion, but to leave to every one that, as free as the Elements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would very fain know now, what theſe men of mighty uniformity, will ſay to theſe great reaſons, and greater authorities of our firſt and ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> the greateſt Princes, and graveſt Perſons, in the World, and what poſſibility they can propoſe, to reduce the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of mens ſpirits, to this their wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful accord? For it is againſt common ſenſe and reaſon, that ever men ſhall be one in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; we know the Heathen could declare, <hi>Quot capita tot ſenſus</hi>; So many men, ſo many mindes: So that they which endeavour this ſpecious unity, ſeem to me, to go about to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon <hi>Aeolus,</hi> and his two and thirty ſonnes, in a bag, as it is ſaid, the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>planders</hi> uſe to do, ſince opinion will blow ſtill from every point of the Compaſſe. And as any confinement of the winde, torments nature with an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, ſo to rob the ſoul of its freedom, (which is far more agil and diffuſive) muſt needs cauſe a cholick, with an inflammation, in the bowels of a Kingdom. Till then, theſe pitiful unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity-mongers, be pointed at, as the onely enemies of a State, and this wretched per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion be wrought out of the hearts of men, that they ought to make all men walke that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170384:131"/>
way par-force, which their byaſſed Prieſts cry up for the onely right; and till men be leſſe in the Letter, that they may be more one, in the Spirit, (which none but the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual can apprehend) and until they leave crying for fire from Heaven, againſt Brethren in the Faith, we ſhall alwayes have our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Country too, in a flame, though perhaps themſelves may be firſt in the aſhes.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, it ſhall ſatisfie me, and I hope, all the good people of the Land, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the <hi>Idaea,</hi> and bleſſed example of our gracious ſecond, as he did alwayes that of the firſt, <hi>Moſes,</hi> who oppoſed himſelf, and all his power, againſt thoſe envious ſpirits, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unity for their ſchiſmatical breaches of Chriſts body, and Faith for their factions; and ſo ſuppreſſing the true ſpirit of Propheſie in all others would be thought to ingroſſe it to themſelves; whereas, God knows, they have none at all of it; for the burning heats of their perſecutions, and the bright flames of brotherly charity, are lighted from as diſtant fires, as Heaven is from Hell.</p>
               <p>His Moſaical Highneſſe therefore, in humble imitation of his firſt Great Maſter, in this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of his, and in obedience to the Divine exhortations of the Apoſtle, who chargeth us <hi>not to quench the Spirit, nor deſpiſe Propheſying</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5.19, 20.</note> and like a true Father of the children of the Prophets, ever ſupported them, in their their fair, and full liberty, of Propheſying; that

               <p>Thus we are at length arrived, within the higheſt Port of perſonal perfection, that any Prince can poſſibly call an Anchor in: the ſublimeſt ſtep that mortal man is capable to mount. The Stars, we know, are beheld in
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170384:133"/>
the bottom of a pit, and profound humility, maketh the moſt radiant ſplendours to appear in Princely greatneſſe.</p>
               <p>The Sun, we ſee, that is the Prince of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, diſpelleth alwayes all the groſſeſt, thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and ſtiffeſt, vapours, and draweth the thinneſt and moſt ſubtile to himſelf. How much more then that we do attenuate, leſſen, and anihilate our ſelves, which we can do no other way ſo well, as by the practiſe of this celeſtial vertue of Humility, ſo much the nearer we are ſure to approach to the Son of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and true Glory.</p>
               <p>Nay, that Son of Righteouſneſſe and true Glory himſelf, was pleaſed not to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo illuſtrious to us, in any one particular, as in the practiſe of this, both profound and ſublime vertue; the whole courſe of his life, from the Crib, to the Croſſe, being nothing elſe but a conſtant moving homily of Humility. It is no wonder then, that the Holy ſpirit of God, was pleaſed to take ſuch punctual care, ſo expreſſely to deſcribe, this excellency in our great Patriarch; and I doubt not, but upon a ſtrict examen, we ſhall find our late Princely Protector, and ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, in this alſo, as well as in all his other moſt heroical perfections.</p>
               <p>As for his humility to Godward, and pure meekneſſe of ſpirit, in ſubmiſſion to his Will, and Divine Commands, I hope, we have pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well put out of queſtion already; as for his remarkable humility, and meekneſſe of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170384:134"/>
ſpirit towards man, his continual converſation cannot but bring in ſufficient evidence.</p>
               <p>Is there any man now living, that can with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice tax him of any pride, or imperious diſtance, that he ever kept with his people? No, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly known, to all that ever knew him, that he did alwayes communicate himſelf with ſo much ſweetneſſe, affability, facility, and curteſie, that he did ever augment his reſpect, by very familiarity; the uſual courſe moſt commonly to diſſolve it, and in that reſembled perfectly the moſt precious Amethyſt, which ſhines ſo much the more clearly, and orientally, as it has been more often worne. As nothing was too high for his courage, underſtanding, &amp; piety, ſo nothing was too low for his bounty, converſation, &amp; curteſie. For God did not only beſtow on him, an equal proportion of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical ſpirit of meekneſſe; but conferred upon him in like manner, the glorious gift which the Scripture attributes to the Patriarch <hi>Joſeph,</hi> both in the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> and in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which is no ſmall gift of the Spirit indeed, to oblige hearts with ſweetneſſe; not unlike thoſe famous Engins of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> which made water mount by deſcending; ſo his moſt honourable humility vouchſafed to deſcend, but to make himſelf re-aſcend to the ſource of the prime ſublimity, and ſo as his vertues upon Earth, have made him Laurels here, they have procured for him moſt incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Crowns in Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Bern.</note>Well then might bleſſed <hi>Bernard</hi> tell us,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170384:134"/>
that <hi>Magna virtus eſt humiltas honorata,</hi> Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in perſons of Honour, is a moſt ſublime vertue; indeed it is a piece of excellency, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper for Princes, and great Perſons. I will not deny but poor inferiour ſpirits, may be capable of it; but this, I am ſure of, that they which lie buried in a baſe condition, have nothing of an equal latitude to expreſſe it; for the great Ones of the Earth onely, are they, that are moſt roughly aſſaulted with the ſtorms of Pride, and ſo conſequently muſt receive more glory and praiſe from the repulſe of it.</p>
               <p>Nay, I will be bold to aſſert yet further, in the behalf of our Moſaical high Humility, that all the vertues in the World, ſignifie nothing at all, without it, no more, than as was ſaid in the Aſcent, a wholeſom Medicament would do to a mans health, with a mixture of poiſon in it: amaſſe all that can be called good in any ſingle perſon, and let this one thing onely be wanting, thoſe very vertues will prove but ſpecious vices, nay, holy traytors to his ſoul, and betray it to the very worſt of impieties. Let a man have all the liberality and munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in the World, if he be once proud of it, it will preſently degenerate into a very foul prodigality; and as the wiſe <hi>Socrates</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170384:135"/>
is to be made with a prudent oeconomy. Give a man conſtancy, and let him grow up to a pride of it, the nature of the vertue will be preſently deſtroyed, and ſoon paſſe into plain obſtinacy, and perverſity, the moſt dangerous condition that a man can poſſibly fall into, though otherwiſe he may be, the learnedſt, and moſt knowing perſon alive.</p>
               <p>It was moſt excellently well obſerved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the Learned <hi>Gerſon,</hi>

               <p>A Motto therefore fit for a true valiant man, to carry in his colours, is, that which I have ſeen in a Noble hand, <hi>Pauca timeo, Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciora deſpicio,</hi> I fear few things, and deſpiſe fewer; Now this unhappy ſpirit of Pride, is the mother of this curſed ſecurity, and what is worſe, inſolency; with which, true forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude can no way cohabit,<note place="margin">Guichard, l. <hi>2.</hi>

               <p>I have ſeen a man in like manner, by a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous conceit of his own patience, (which it may be, he had at firſt, to a vertuous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion) fool himſelf into the opinion of a <hi>Stoick</hi>; but, indeed grew worſe than any <hi>Stock,</hi> or, at leaſt, as ſtupid.</p>
               <p>I ſhould be infinite to enumerate the many maſſacres which this unhappy pride of ſpirit, makes continually upon the whole chained of

               <p>No wonder then, that the All wiſe Spirit of God, took ſuch particular care to recommend it to us, in the perſon of our firſt <hi>Moſes</hi>; and as eaſie muſt it be to conceive a reaſon, why our gracious ſecond, his precious Parallel, ſhould ſo faithfully endeavour to imitate him in that, as well as his other perfections, they being both pre-ordained by God, to be the greateſt Magazines of all vertuous goodneſſe amongſt men, that either this, or that Age has produced.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen them both in their humble retreat from, and modeſt avoidance of worldly honours &amp; advancements to humane greatneſs, which after they were ſo violently compel'd unto, by Divine precept, behold, and admire, with what moderation, humility, and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, of ſpirit, they have ever managed them: excellently therefore does holy <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſtile this tanſcendent vertue of Humility,<note place="margin">Cyprian de Nativ.

               <p>Firſt the higheſt petigree of the greateſt man upon Earth, is but to have been an eternity in nothing; for if we mount ſtill upwards, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending to the prime ſource and origine of time, when we ſhall have reckoned millions of Ages, we ſhall find nothing but inexplicable Labyrinths, and abyſſes of one great eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, without beginning or end: and when we ſhall preſent to our thoughts, all that time which has preceded, be it reall, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary, we ſhall be aſhamed to ſee, ſo many millions of years, wherein we had not ſo much as the being of a ruſh, a ſilly gnat, or a but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-flie.</p>
               <p>Nay, that bluſtring inſolent Rodomont, be he what, and where he will, that threatneth this day to hew down mountains, and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-ſtrike his fellow mortals, and thinks the whole houſe of Nature was created onely for him, and ſo prepares to ſwallow it all by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice, and waſte it as faſt by riot, thirty or forty years agoe, more or leſſe, was not able to contend for excellency, with a pitiful Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-pillar.</p>
               <p>His Moſaical Highneſſe, I ſay, conſidered all this, and a great deal more, to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170384:137"/>
a true imitator of his Maſter. Firſt, though his Nobility of birth, was very great, as we have ſeen, he never intoxicated his brains with it, as ſome do now adayes, that make it their buſineſſe to dig out, and diſentomb their Grandfathers, as it were from the aſhes of old <hi>Troy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Auſon. in Paneg.</note> and ſpend ſo much time, as <hi>Auſonius</hi> ſayes very well, <hi>In ſearching out of uncertain Parents, that they many times give occaſion to ſuſpect, that they have none certain.</hi> No, my Lord, though he knew very well how to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the happineſſe of a good extraction; yet for any man to be proudly pufft up with it, he accounted no leſſe than madneſſe; for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving the whole maſſe of mankind, we ſhall find, as <hi>Plato</hi> told us, long agoe, <hi>That there is no King which comes not from Clownes, nor Clown, who is not deſcended from the blood of Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then for beauty of body, though his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe had as fair a proportion, as any man, as we have likewiſe ſhewed; yet he could as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pride himſelf in that, knowing it to be but a covering for ordures, the blanching of a dunghill with ſnow, or at the beſt, but a fad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding flower of the field, which hath, as it were, for Horizon, the very inſtant of its birth, <hi>Et dum naſcantur conſenuiſſe roſas</hi>: no more could any of his great natural, or acquired parts, raiſe him above his proper pitch, knowing the beſt learning amongſt men, to be but a quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ignorance, the memory it ſelf to be, but the belly of the ſoul, and moſt frequently fill'd with nothing but winde: the beſt and moſt
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170384:137"/>
acute wit of man, he lookt upon as a poor thin thing, like the ſpiders web, and fitter to catch flies, than any thing elſe: and as for the judgement, he knew how dangerous a thing it was to confide in that, little leſſe than a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie in the heart of man.</p>
               <p>No more could his Moſaick Soul be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated with all the honours he enjoy'd, and greatneſſe of this world; for he took all them for burdens, and at the beſt, lookt upon them, but as golden Maskes, and weather-cocks of inconſtancy; and for all manner of praiſes, flattery, complacency, and ticklings of ſome vain men, he ever hated and contemned, as fit onely to inebriate ſhallow brains: for riches he evermore ſcorned, as the offall of the earth, the neſt of ruſt, and tinder of concupiſcence: for Palaces and ſtately Houſes, he valued but as the bones of the earth, pil'd one upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, with ciment and morter: for precious Stones, he eſteemed as they were, the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an inraged Sea, borrowing their worth onely from illuſion.</p>
               <p>Much leſſe could his great wiſdom be cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of that vanity, wherewith men uſually pride themſelves, in cloaths, meer nouriſhment for moths, to cover bodies which muſt be food for wormes; he lookt upon all bravery of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, but as plaiſters of the ſcars of ſin, to wit, nakedneſſe: borrowed feathers from all kinds of birds, unpuniſht thefts, witneſſes of our poverty, that makes us to beg the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſo many creatures, to cover our
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:170384:138"/>
ſhame: Moreover, he knew, that <hi>Veſtitus ut tegit corpus ita detegit animum,</hi> Our attire does not more cover the nakedneſſe of our bodies, than diſcover that of our mindes; his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe therefore purpoſely did (as all wiſe men will) avoid any vanity, or oſtentation in that. Nor yet could his Moſaick Highneſſe, be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with that empty piece of pride, which moſt great ones now adayes are poſſeſt withal, to behold behind him, great and gay Trains of ſervants, who but burden their Maſters with their many ſins, and make them become an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for their accumulated follies.</p>
               <p>See here a miracle of men, in the contempt of riches and honours; for the firſt he never cared to hold, lockt up in his coffers, nor ever thought were as they ſhould be, but when they were diſtributed; for they reſembled, as I have heard, he uſed to ſay, nothing more naturally, than a dunghill, which ſtinks when it lies heaped together, but fattens fields when ſpread abroad: and for the other, he took it for as great a meer mockery, to affect great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe amongſt men, as if a Rat ſhould pride himſelf to be a Lord forſooth, amongſt Mice. He was ſo far from feeding himſelf with, or priding himſelf in, glory; that he would often ſay too, as I have heard, all that, was but the ſwelling of the eare. Are not theſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegms worthy of ſo great a Prince? In fine, his Highneſſe alwayes concluded with the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk, Quomodo potentem vinum decipit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Habak. <hi>2.</hi>

               <p>There is no man will deny ſure, but that all thoſe actions, and expreſſions aforeſaid, were very high humiliations before God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable marks of a pure Moſaick ſpirit; but where were his humilities to men, and his meekneſſes of ſpirit, in points of government? If this be demanded, by any doubting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, let him tell me, how often he has found any ſurly, ſupercilious looks fall from him, or any faſtidious, diſdainful words, or geſtures, which ſo uſually accompany common great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?</p>
               <p>No, his Highneſſe, beſides the great amae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and affability of his Noble-nature, had better ſtudied the accompliſht <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Xexoph.

               <p>In ſhort, his Highneſſe was truly that, which
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170384:139"/>
the moſt gracious Emperour <hi>Titus,</hi> would have every Prince to be careful to be; that is, Sweet, Serene, and Pleaſant to all, and <hi>Non oportere à ſermone Principis quemquam triſtem diſcedere,</hi> That it was not fit for any Prince, to ſend any man from his preſence away ſad, or diſcontented.</p>
               <p>His Highneſſe very well underſtood, that <hi>Verba aliquando munera faciunt</hi>: and if he were forced at any time to deny a favour, he did it alwayes ſo, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t benignis negata res verbis, ſit gratior quam conceſſa moroſis,</hi> That he would oblige more by his very denials, than ſome Kings that I have known, would do by their very grants.</p>
               <p>It was obſerved by a great Critick upon <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> that <hi>Quamvis eum Clementia, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitas, &amp; fortitudo commendarent, odium ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, conjuratio &amp; praematura mors oppreſſit, quod elatior populo blandiri, ſenatoribus aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere gravaretur aut neſciret, verbis quoque ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur aſperis,</hi> &amp;c. Though he was hugely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable for his Clemency, Liberality, and Courage, yet he fell under a ſad Fate, for want of a little complacency with the people, and ſoothing the Senate with ſome comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and had alwayes too much aſperity in his tongue.</p>
               <p>Could any of theſe imputations ever light upon our Moſaical Protector? No, he was ever as diſtant from them, as the Sphere of fire, can be from the Center of the Earth; ſo that we may ſecurely conclude, that his late Highneſſe
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170384:139"/>
has as much out-done <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> in this, as in all his other glories: never was that great Title of Serenity, ſo truly given to any Prince, as to him; for it was born with him.</p>
               <p>Thus we have ſeen theſe two great Perſons of Honour, our firſt and ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this grand Theater of the World, from the firſt Scene of their humble retirements to the laſt iſſue and Cataſtrophe of all their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſes, attired with nothing but humility, that ſtill accompanying and crowning all their Actions; as it was the baſis, ſo it was the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical point of all their greatneſſe; nay, the very Orb and Element, that all their other Vertues moved in, and by which they arrived at all their glories; ſo diſproving the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy of <hi>Seneca,</hi> who ſayes that <hi>Servitus eſt magnitudinus, non poſſe fieri minorem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> That it is the ſlavery of greatneſſe, not to be made leſſe; which though may be true in bodies, they have proved to be contrary in ſouls: and what <hi>Pliny</hi> aſſures us, to be more true, that <hi>Natura nuſquam magis quàm in minimis tota eſt</hi>:<note place="margin">Plin.</note> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is moſt entirely it ſelf, and whole in the leaſt things.</p>
               <p>This ſweet littleneſſe of theirs, is that, which has rendred them ſo great, in the ſight of God and man; for by ſo leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and annihalating themſelves, they have enlarged their glories, and raiſed themſelves ſo many degrees towards Heaven, as erected eternal Trophes to their honour upon earth,

and thoſe as great, as ever were written, or can be, in the Records of Fame.</p>

                  <p>We have ſeen this matchleſſe couple, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Parallel to themſelves, in all their moſt elate, ſtirring, and aſtoniſhing, great actions too, wherein they have ever ſhewed their courage like Eagles, confronting all ſtormes; like Lions, which oppoſe all violences; like Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds never to be broken; like Rocks, ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all waves; and Anvills, reſiſting all the ſtroakes of hammers: and in a word,<note place="margin">Ambroſ. in haec verba Geneſis <hi>2.</hi> Nomen flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tii, Tygris.</note> like to nothing ſo much, as to the River <hi>Tygris,</hi> which as bleſſed <hi>Ambroſe</hi> obſerves, <hi>Quodam curſu rapido, reſiſtentia quaeque tranſverberat, neque aliquibus curſus ejus impedimentorum haeret

                  <p>We have ſeen theſe two ſuper-excellent Perſons, in all their eminencies of State, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, Supreme Magiſtracies, and Principalities; we have ſeen them likewiſe in all the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of their piety towards, and worſhip of the Omnipotent, and the renunciation of their proper intereſts, for the ſervice of the Deity: nay, we have ſeen them brought up by the Divine hand, to the higheſt pitch of Propheſie it ſelf, and yet their great ſouls could not make a ſtop there, but muſt mount a little higher; and that indeed is the higheſt ſtep of all Princely perfection, as we ſhewed in our laſt Aſcent, to wit, humility and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt certain, that great felicities, are ſo tickliſh, that it is much more eaſie, to live on the dunghill of <hi>Job,</hi> with patience, than in the management of great Kingdoms with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.

                  <p>It is doubtleſſe the heavyeſt burden, to bear a great fortune well; we ſee how apt the ſpirits of this Age are, to have their eyes dazled with a little ſparkle of felicity; their skins are preſently puffed up, and their ſouls drencht in ſome moſt diſmal pride, and a ſad deluge of tyrannies and diſſolutions: We have ſeen our Moſaical ſpirits of another temper, each of them, like another <hi>Abdolomin,</hi> who did paſſe from a Garden, into a Royal Palace,<note place="margin">Abodolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min.</note> and did handle the Scepter, with the ſame humility of heart, without either prejudice to the people, or his own authority, as one would do a ſpade.</p>
                  <p>This is a vertue indeed, which is but very rarely ſeen here in earth, but is admired in heaven it ſelf; and it is a vertue doubtleſſe which comes immediately from the treaſures of God Almighty; and of this, we have ſeen our incomparable paire of Princes, giving us ſuch an example, as if they were ordained by God, to declare how high Chriſtian perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may aſcend, by planting of a glorious humiliy, upon the Diamonds, Pearles, Emralds, Rubies, and Saphyrs, of Regal Crowns, and leading in Courts, the lives of Hermits, ſo commanding greatneſſe, and humility, which ſeldom will admit of any aliance at all, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:170384:144"/>
to kiſſe, and ſweetely embrace one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Have we not ſeen, I ſay, all this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently made out already, and that it is, not poſſible to find more perſonal perfectious heapt up in mortal men? Have we not ſeen, I ſay, this heavenly paire of moſt incomparable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, onely Parallel to one another, like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> thoſe happy Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Mariners, from the very firſt Port of their Cradels, to the ſecure Harbour of a good old age, ſailing through a boundleſs Sea of Bliſs, amidſt the ſtormes of State and War, making all fair weather about them, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging us to ſteer our courſe after them, if we can?</p>
                  <p>Nay yet, have we not ſeen them, what is more ſtrange, like two Phenixes together, yet incorporated, or twined at leaſt, like the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi> in the Zodiack, flie through a whole heaven of happineſs upon earth? Then, whither are we going now? What, are there any Aſcents yet higher, for our Moſaick ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to mount? Surely not, as to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall perfections aforeſaid, we have ſaid all we can, and ſeen as much as we can know, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we could take Poſt upon a <hi>Pegaſus,</hi> and piercing the Empyrean, hire a Convoy of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, to carry us into the beatifical Heaven, to ſee the Crowns, and Glories, that they enjoy. Whither is it then, that this Tranſcendental Aſcent will lead us? why ſurely, to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime conſideration of thoſe Divine and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent indulgencies, priviledges, and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170384:144"/>
prerogatives, that they enjoyed, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary favour of Heaven, towards their later ends, which are no leſſe remarkable cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, than all their former painful Aſcents, before could be; good Princes, like the Sun, ſhining alwayes forth moſt gloriouſly, at their going down.</p>
                  <p>Now, the firſt great favour, and principal prerogative, that we find our firſt great <hi>Moſes,</hi> had indulged to him by Almighty God, was this of our preſent Aſcent, to have the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his Succeſſor, in ſo great a Charge: For though the Lord was pleaſed to elect, yet he commanded his ſervant <hi>Moſes</hi> to nominate, <hi>Joſhua</hi> to the people, for their Captain, and his Succeſſor.</p>
                  <p>Now has not the great goodneſſe of Heaven been graciouſly pleaſed to indulge the very ſame priviledge, and prerogative, to his late moſt Serene Highneſſe, of glorious memory, our ſecond <hi>Moſes?</hi> Firſt for the nomination of this happy Prince, that is at preſent placed over us, it is evident, was from his Highneſſe himſelf, though the election of him, as indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitably was from God, as that of the great <hi>Joſhua</hi> before him, was: and this liberty, or ſupreme power of nomination, was given to his late moſt Serene Highneſſe, by Almighty God, not onely by a private revelation, as the other was; but publickly declared and enacted too, by the Repreſentatives of the people aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Parliament, who are preſum'd to carry <hi>Vocem Dei,</hi> the voice of God along with them
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170384:145"/>
likewiſe: So that on our parts there remained nothing to be done, but to ſhew our dutiful reception, and active obedience, and to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as the Text of our Aſcent expreſſeth it, <hi>to all that he ſhall ſay. Sic ſui ſemper erit Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrii jubere, ſufficiet &amp; nobis ſola obſequii gloria,</hi> So he ſhall have the honour ſtill to command, and we will ſatisfie our ſelves with the glory of obeying.</p>
                  <p>But now, whether this way of a Divine ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to a Monarchy, be better, and of a more ancient right, than to come to it by an Hereditary ſucceſſion, as to a private Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (as his Highneſſe himſelf expreſſeth it) though for my part, I think there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; yet I find it to be a diſpute, <hi>De trop longue haleine,</hi> as the <hi>Frenchman</hi> ſpeaks, of too long breath, and difficult debate, for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Parallel; So I ſhall refer it till another occaſion, and deſire the Reader in the mean time, to accept of his late moſt Serene Highneſs his own excellent words (in the Speech before cited) for a full deciſion of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</p>

is indeed, mention of the Circumciſion of one, but never any thing more ſpoken of him; So it is to be preſumed, that either he had none living, or at leaſt, as we ſaid before, not capable of ſo great a Charge.</p>
                  <p>God Almighty in the mean time, brings this high favour and prerogative, as near to him, as poſſibly might be, next to the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a ſon, which (as it ſeems) by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane collection, then could not be.</p>

love! O happy Priviledges of a Prince, and Prerogatives unexpreſſible! O Soveraigne Favours of Heaven, undeniable! What man living is there now upon the face of the Earth, that can diſpute, whether it be not a moſt ſublime inſtance of the Almighties affections, to any Fathers, it being granted (which I hope will not be denied) that he is the Soveraign Mover, and Architect of our lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; when he is pleaſed to propagate their greatneſſe, and glories to their children? it being doubtleſſe the greateſt temporal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, that men of honour can be cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of upon Earth, to have a flouriſhing Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity given them by God, which may make them eternally to live in the memory of men, by thoſe moſt lively images of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
                  <p>It has been, we know, obſerved by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous in all Ages, that thoſe Princes and great Perſons, that have lived any way ſordidly, or viciouſly, fatting themſelves with the blood and ſweat of the poor, or have eſtabliſht any Tyrannies in the World, have neither been fruitful, nor fortunate, in their Poſterites: and as Nature has ever ſhewed it ſelf to be ſcanty in the propagation of beaſts of prey, as Wolves and other creatures, deſigned onely for ſpoil, and no other uſe, which would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſoon bring the earth into deſolation: So Almighty God, by a ſecret oeconomy of his Divine Providence, permitteth not the Princes, or Potentates, who have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170384:148"/>
intentions, and the projects both of his will, and Statute.</p>
                  <p>Then what has been the Cataſtrophe, or ſad iſſue of that Family too, for treading in his moſt unfortunate foot-ſteps, we of this Age, have fully ſeen; for no one of them, that I know of yet, has died a natural death, and the laſt prince we had of that Line, loſt his whole head-ſhip of the Church, with his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative and Soveraignty over Laws, ſo much deſired and contended for, in thoſe dayes, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a pitiful Scaffold, erected before the Porch of that Palace, where his impious Predeceſſor, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, the firſt of all Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, and his body by a ſtrange provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, without any forefight or contrivance of man at all, was carried to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and there depoſited in the ſame Vault with him.

                  <p>That this was a moſt Princely, and Supreme priviledge, which our firſt <hi>Moſes</hi> by the favour of Heaven, enjoyed; to lay his hands upon, bleſſe, and put ſome of his own ſpirit upon his Succeſſor, in his life time; I preſume, none will diſpute, and as little can any man, I hope, doubt, but that our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> too, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged by God a Parallel prerogative, and did the very like, to his moſt gracious Son and ſucceſſor: knowing him, as we all have done, to have ever been, a moſt prudent, pious, and indulgent Father of his Country, and ſo by conſequence, he muſt have been much more of his own Family, and moſt of all of his Eldeſt Son, who was not onely to be the Head of that, but of three Kingdoms, and other vaſt Dominions, and Territories, thereto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Nay, that he did actually part with ſome of his honour, to put upon him, in his own life time, was made notoriouſly evident, in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of that high Title of Chancellor of the Univerſitie of <hi>Oxford</hi>; I ſay again, high Title, and take it to be the higheſt, next to the Soveraignty it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> can afford.

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:170384:150"/>
of the four Cardinal, moſt Ancient, Famous, and Flouriſhing Univerſities, in the Chriſtian World? that has been ever acknowledged by Forreigners themſelves, to have been the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Seminary of the greateſt ſpirits, which have held predominance in all manner of Learning, and Sciences, and was ever lookt upon, as the glorious Altar of the Sun, from whence light was wont to be borrowed, to illuminate all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lamps. To be the Head, I ſay, of this moſt glorious Body, who can deny to be equal to ſo great and good a Father to give, and to ſo hopeful and gracious a Son, as was this our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Protector, and ſecond <hi>Joſhua</hi> to receive?</p>
                  <p>Then as to the other part of this grand Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaick Prerogative, held forth in our Aſcent, leſſe doubt ſure muſt be made, that his late Highneſſe was moſt thoroughly aſſured of the great worth, and due deſerving of his Succeſſor, as alſo of his great felicity and proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, in all his future undertakings.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by reaſon of his Highneſſe his great illuminations, and particular revelations, that he had from God himſelf, (as we have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſeen in all his actions before) which certainly could not fail him now, in ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant an affaire as this, that ſo nearly did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, the happineſſe of ſo great a people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he that had ſo clear and thorough an inſpection, into the aptitude of all his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, that he employed, as we have likewiſe ſeen in thoſe Aſcents, that treat of his Election of them, how could he chooſe but have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight

                  <p>Then laſtly, how could he be unknowing to thoſe perfections, which all the Nation has been ſo ſatisfied in, for theſe many years? that he has been with reverence lookt upon, and admired, as an Angel deſcending from Heaven, and vouchſafing to let himſelf be inchaſed, within a humane body: a Prince of ſo incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable ſweet and excellent diſpoſition, that he may be worthy indeed to be called the dear delight of God, as well as man.

                  <p>Then for his bleſſed Marriage, the next thing pointed at in the Propheſie, that can be comparable to nothing more, than to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of <hi>Juno,</hi> where the gall of the offering was never preſented.

                  <p>All this, I ſay, is the Anagrammatical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of <hi>Virgil</hi> himſelf; and as to thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Honours, and Fortunes, which his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe has ſince arrived at, all that proves to be my friends proper Propheſie.

                  <p>There is no man will deny ſure, that this was a very tranſcendent favour and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, indulged by God, to this bleſſed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch. And has our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> received leſſe favourable kindneſſe from the hands of the Almighty? Nay, has he not in this too, infinitely outgone the prerogatives of his Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, and great Prototype? Yes certainly, as far, as fruition can exceed an expectation, or a poſſeſſion ſurpaſſeth a bare proſpect onely; ſo much more of priviledge and favour, did our ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> find, from the goodnſſe of his Heavenly Father, and receive, beyond the former: For the ſacred Text moſt plainly affirmes, that the great Patriarch <hi>Moſes,</hi> was permitted onely to ſee the Land of Promiſe, and take his bare view, of that beloved Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of ſweet <hi>Canaan,</hi> or <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> then flowing with Milk and Honey, and towards which, he had been above forty years a marching in the Head of his moſt mutinous, and troubleſome Army, yet not ſuffered to enter.</p>
                  <p>But has not our ſacred ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> made his entry? Has he not onely entred, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed for divers years his land of Promiſe? Has he not driven out all his enemies before him, and made ſo happy an end of his great
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:170384:156"/>
Works, as to have been well and ſecurely ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, in the quiet poſſeſſion and government of his acquired Dominions, and Territories? Nay how much more advantageous was this favour to his late Highneſſe, in reſpect of his Succeſſor too, than that which his Archetype, the former <hi>Moſes</hi> had. His late moſt Serene Highneſſe, we ſee, has left his Princely Son to ſucceed him in a cleer eſtate, and free from any incombrances, either at home, or abroad: and indeed thoſe few forraign broyls, that we are ingaged in, may be rather called his moſt Serene Highneſſe his ſports, and pretty diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements, than any matters of troubleſom bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, and muſt prove to be more profitable than dangerous: Whereas the former good <hi>Moſes,</hi> left his ſucceeding <hi>Joſhua,</hi> not a foot of land, but what he was to fight for, and could make him indeed heir apparent to nothing, but his ſword: and leave him, as it were, a meer Souldier of Fortune, to cut his way out to his expectations. Though this was very true, that the Divine Patriarch knew full well, that the Lords promiſes, and bleſſed providence would be to him a moſt ſecure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; yet none can deny, that this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Heaven muſt in any indifferent eſteem, fall ſhort of that, which was vouchſafed to our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> as much as an eſtate that is litigious, and imbrangled with law ſuits, is to be undervalued to a cleer one, that is in quiet and undiſturbed poſſeſſion; or the miſerable condition of war, is worſe than the moſt happy

                  <p>Thus we ſee, how our pious Patriarch has no ſooner taken order for a ſufficient ſucceſſor for himſelf, and a convenient Captain for his people, but he does moſt readily diſpoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for his laſt great journey, and Aſcent, and moſt cheerfully marcheth up the fatal Mount, whileſt every ſtep that he took, drew blood from the hearts of his poor, diſconſolate, and moſt afflicted people, who followed him with their eies, where they could not with their perſons; nay made their tears to reach him, when the ſight of their eyes had loſt him, forcing thoſe floods, contrary to the courſe of other waters, to run violently upwards, and with an aſcending ſtream, bedew every foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep of their precious deer Prince, and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Patriarch. All the happy joys, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough contentments that they did receive from their brave new Maſter, and Captain General <hi>Joſhua,</hi> could never make them forget their old dear deliverer, and conductor, <hi>Moſes.</hi> So true it is, what is obſerved by all Aſtrologers, that every Planet which has its exaltation in one Sign, finds ever its counterpoiſes in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; nor can there be any good ſucceſſe in humane affairs, on one ſide, but it is preſently
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:170384:158"/>
paid on the other, with ſome diſcontent. Juſt thus, and no otherwiſe, did our great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and gracious ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> depart from us: who receiving from the Almighty the ſummons of his approaching death, whileſt he was in the plains of <hi>Moab,</hi> in his Houſe or Palace of Country retirement, as ſpeedily and cheerfully as the former <hi>Moſes</hi> did; prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf to march up to this Metropolitical Mount, even to the top of <hi>Piſgah,</hi> his own Palace here: where after he had appointed his happy Succeſſor, and taken careful order about the affairs of theſe Kingdoms, as well as of his own Family, and taken leave of all his Friends and Familiars, and dearly beloved Army, her rendred up his ſoul to his God and Saviour, as ſweetly as little children uſe to fall aſleep, upon the breaſts of their Nurſes; leaving us in the mean time drowned in the deluges of our own tears: and the ſorrow was ſo general, that one would have thought that every houſe was bearing of their firſt born to burial, nothing was to be ſeen amongſt us but tears, nor heard but groans, yellings, horrors, aſtoniſhments, and repreſentations of death. And whereas the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> mourned but thirty daies, for their <hi>Moſes,</hi> we have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the loſſe of ours, more than thrice thirty daies, and yet are not wearied with weeping, but <hi>dolori etiam feſſo, ſtimulos addidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus novos,</hi> we have ſet ſpurs to our tired ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and upon any occaſion of his mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thoſe flood-gates are ſo continually open,

that they have almoſt made an inundation upon us, and we may ſtill ſee him ſailing through all the good peoples eyes of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and floating upon the ſalt waters, that himſelf has made. For my part, I muſt profeſs that whileſt my Pen is paſſing over this ſtory, I cannot chooſe, but commix the ſorrowful water of my eyes, with my mourning ink, ſo may be pardoned, I hope, if at preſent I write any thing diſorderly, as indeed I have done all, but cannot doubt that the candour of thoſe ſpirits, which are touched with the like paſſion, will out of pitty pardon mine. Nay, indeed, what <hi>Engliſh</hi> man is there that would not be out of love with life, ſince he has pleaſed to embrace death, <hi>ſatis enim vixit, qui vitan cum Principe tanto explevit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tatitus.</note> for has he not lived long enough in this world, that can be ſo happy, as to march out of it, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſuch a Prince? But I muſt confeſſe I am to blame, nor can I but rebuke my ſelf, as it is fit I ſhould, before I can reprove others for this unruly, unchriſtian, and, indeed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable paſſion.</p>
                  <p>For firſt it is a moſt manifeſt repining both againſt the hand of God, and him, for the Lord has now placed him in his happy Tabernacle of Repoſe, and abſolv'd his immortal ſoul from all the toilſome fetters and ligaments of fleſh, as the divine <hi>Plato,</hi> though a <hi>Pagan,</hi> well expreſſeth it, when he ſaies, <hi>Pater miſericors illis mortalia vincula faciebat,</hi> God herein, ſaith he,<note place="margin">Plato in Timao.</note> hath moſt mercifully provided, like
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:170384:159"/>
an indulgent father; for ſeeing that the ſoul of man was like to be ſhut up within the body, as in a priſon, he hath in his great mercy, made its chains to be mortal. How much more, then, ought we Chriſtians to apprehend the happineſſe of death, that know that very day, which we account the laſt of our lives, is to be the firſt of our felicities; nay it is to be the birth of another eternal day, which muſt draw aſide the Curtain, and diſcover to us the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſecrets of nature: it is the day that muſt produce us, to thoſe great and divine lights, which we behold here onely, with the eye of faith, in this vale of tears and miſeries. It is the happy day, which muſt put us between the arms of the Heavenly Father, after a courſe of an unquiet life, turmoiled ſtill with ſtorms, and ſo many diſturbances.</p>
                  <p>Who is ſo ſottiſh as not to ſee, that we are at this preſent, in the world, as in the very belly or womb of nature, like little infants deſtitute both of air and light, and can onely look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and contemplate the happineſſe of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſouls ſeparate from bodies. What pleaſure muſt it be then to go out of a dungeon ſo dark, a priſon ſo ſtreight, from ſuch infinite ordures and miſeries, to enter into thoſe ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Temples of eternal ſplendors, where our being never ſhall have end, our knowledge ſhall admit no ignorance, nor love or joy ſuffer a change.</p>
                  <p>The old Poets themſelves did alwayes fancy,<note place="margin">Juven. ſat</note> that there was ſome happineſſe extraordinary
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:170384:160"/>
in death, which the gods, as they ſaid, did cunningly conceal from us, that men ſhould endure to live; they are the very words of one of them, <hi>Mortaleſque, dii caelant, ut vivere durent, felix eſſe mori.</hi> Other Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens there were, that by meet force of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy could tell us, that the body was to the ſoul,<note place="margin">Lucan.</note> as the ſhadow of the earth in the eclipſe of the Moon: and do we not ſee how this bright Planet, which illuminates our nights, ſeems to be very unwillingly captivated in the dark, but labours and ſparkles with ſtriving, to get aloft, and free it ſelf from thoſe dull earthly impreſſions: So did his late Highneſſe his moſt illuſtrious and faithful ſoul, moſt readily untwine and diſingage it ſelf from his body; well knowing it had a much better houſe, in the inheritance of God, which is not a manufacture of men, but a monument of the hands of the great Artificer, where he will be much more delighted, to ſee the Sun, Moon, and ſtars, and all the Elements under his feet, than he could poſſibly be here, with beholding them over his head. In ſhort, who would think it much (I am ſure his Highneſſe did not) to give up the life of a <hi>Piſmire</hi> (for the greateſt Prince's upon earth, is no better) in exchange for immortality? he had alwayes, we know, like a good Chriſtian, death in his deſire, and life in patience.</p>
                  <p>This truly I ſhould preſume ſufficient to ſatiſfie and comfort any reaſonable Chriſtians, for the loſſe (as we call it) of his late Highneſs:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="289" facs="tcp:170384:160"/>But ſetting Chriſtianity aſide, methinks it ſhould be ſatisfactory enough for common men, to conſider, that as the Poet tells us, <hi>Lex eſt, non paena perire,</hi>

                     </note> and what the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher aſſures us; that <hi>mors naturae lex eſt, mors tributum officiumque eſt mortalium,</hi> death is a law of nature, no puniſhment, it is the very tribute, and duty of mortals: And what <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> not more elegantly, than truly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>Homines ſicut poma, aut matura cadunt,</hi>

                     <hi>aut acerba ruunt,</hi> Men, like Apples, muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fall ripe, or be pulled down green and ſower.</p>
                  <p>Now I would fain know, what have we to complain of? Did not his Highneſſe live to a very fair, and good old age, to a true Moſaick maturity, For, as was ſaid before, if by Chronological Computation, our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> his forty years, were parallel to the fourſcore of the former when he came into publick em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, then his threeſcore and upwards, when he came to dye, ſtands ſtill parallel with the others hundred and twenty: and as for their ſtrength of body and mind, none can affirm him to be leſſe his parallel to the very laſt: For his Highneſs eye was not dim, nor any of his natural force abated.</p>
                  <p>Thus his gracious God, and benigne nature plentifully provided, for that great and moſt incomparable perſon, that his moſt invincible ſpirit, ſhould never quaile under any ſenſible decay of fleſh.</p>
                  <p>What more of favour, I would fain know,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170384:161"/>
could his moſt Serene Highneſſe receive from the bountiful hands of Heaven? Yet ſome ſpirits there are, ſo diſpoſed to quarrel with the Almighty, that they will not yet be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the divine diſpenſation, but think, and ſay, (I pray God not impiouſly) that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and eternal Father, ſhould have permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome more time of life to a perſon ſo deſerving it; but let them remember, that <hi>mors aequopede pulſat,</hi>

Theſe conſiderations ſure, though drawn from meer Heathens, would be enough to ſatisfie any common underſtandings of men: but theſe quarrelſome perſons, that we ſpeak of, ſure are of opinion, that all happineſſe is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to this poor life; and are, I fear, very neer akin to thoſe, whom <hi>Plato</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">

How much is this pittiful humor of Chriſtians, below the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Philoſophy of <hi>Pagans</hi> themſelves? Amongſt whom we find, that there were a certain peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who by poſitive laws, forbad any man of

fifty years of age, to make uſe of the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, ſaying, that it diſcovered too much love of life: and yet ſome Chriſtians we find at the age of fourſcore, who will not endure to hear a word of death: but of this ſad ſottiſh temper, we know his Moſaical Highneſſe was not, he never valued the putting off his life, more than the ſhifting of his ſhirt, and when he received his citation from Heaven, he as readily obeyed, as his Maſter <hi>Moſes</hi> did, to aſcend his fatal Mount: I pray you then be quiet you cruel friends, and do not diſturb his honored duſt, now ſweetly reſting in his Tabernacle of Repoſe; for if you conſider rightly, you are bound, as the Orator tells you,<note place="margin">Plin.

                     <hi>Non tam vitam illi ereptam, quam mortem donatam cenſere,</hi> not ſo much to think him bereft of life, as to have been endowed with death, in a ripe old age, and after the enjoyment of the fruits of all his labours.</p>
                  <p>Hath not this moſt incomparable perſon, reſembled truely the great Ark in the deluge, which after it had borne the whole World in the bowels of it, amongſt ſo many ſtorms, and fatal convulſions of nature, at length repoſed it ſelf, in the Mountains of <hi>Armenia</hi>? So this moſt admirable Prince, after he had carried in his heart, and entrals a ſpirit, great as the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe it ſelf, amonſt ſo many tears, dolours, and cruel acerbities of contradictions, and had delivered himſelf of that painful burthen, that is, had brought forth our moſt happy

and eſtabliſht peace, he ſtopt upon Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> and from thence went to take his reſt, in the Mountains of <hi>Sion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Lord, like an indulgent Father of a Family, ſends his ſervants to bed, ſo ſoon as they have done their work: it being all the juſtice and reaſon in the World, that they who riſe betimes to ſerve him, and work hard all the day for him, ſhould go in as good time, to ſleep with him.</p>
                  <p>Let us I beſeech you therefore paſſe over this death, in the manner of holy Scripture, which ſpeaks but one word onely of the death of ſo many great perſonages. Let us never ſo much as talk of death in a ſubject ſo wholly repleniſht with immortality. O what a death is that, to be eſteemed, to ſee vice and ſin trodden down under his feet, and Heaven all in Crowns over his head, to ſee men in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, all the Angels in joy, and the arms of God ready to receive him, and fully la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with recompenſes for his great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
                  <p>Nay, that the Lord did purpoſely and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely intend to make his Highneſs his death appear to be a moſt ſignal reward and perfect victory to him, and that he ſhould carry off the ſpoiles of life it ſelf with more triumph, than ever mortal did, is made manifeſt in that it pleaſed his divine Majeſty to take him to himſelf, upon that moſt memorable day, the third of <hi>September,</hi> the greateſt day of all his
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:170384:162"/>
humane glories: that he was pleaſed to put an end to his life, in this World, that very day that he had got ſuch an immortality in fame: to ſet a period to his labours that very day, that he had performed ſo many Herculian ones, for the glory of his God, and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries good; and to crown his daies with ſo glorious a cloſe, nay to give him a heavenly Crown, that very day that he had gotten ſo many earthly ones, and loaden his Victorious Temples, with ſo many flouriſhing Laurels of eternal renown,</p>
                  <p>Then for the glorious burial of our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> though we cannot hold up our Parallel to the heighth of that honour, which the firſt had, to be conveyed to his grave by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and put into the earth by thoſe Almighty hands, which had made him out of it; yet we may ſay, that he was interred with as much ſtate, and carried to his mother earth, with as much ſolemnity, and magnificence, as ever perſon in the World was; nay his very Effigies was honoured, with ſo great a reverence, as if ſome divinity had attended the Royal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>
                  <p>And yet this is not all the glorious Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that his Highneſſe had, for what the Orator ſaid of his Prince, we may, <hi>mutato nomine,</hi> moſt aptly conclude of him. <hi>Totum nec capiet</hi> Olivarium, <hi>brevis iſta tumuli clauſura,</hi> Britannum <hi>nomen &amp; pectus unumquodque nobile, vivum ſtabit defuncto monumentum: vivet ipſe

ſuo letho ſuperſtes, multam aetatem feret etiam mortuus, gloriaeque plenus deducetur ad Poſteros,</hi> &amp;c. The whole great <hi>Oliver</hi> cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, within ſo ſcanty an encloſure, as is the vault that holds his body, the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Name it ſelf, and every noble breaſt of the Nation, ſhall ſtand a living Monument to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſhall his Highneſſe outlive his death, and grow great in glory, whilſt he is conſuming in his grave, and be conveighed into the arms of poſterity, with everlaſting acclamations. Good Princes, as well as Poets, find their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to ſwell from their laſt aſhes, and like <hi>Phoenixes</hi> ſpring afreſh, from their funeral Piles, as we ſhall more at large make out, in our next, which is our laſt Moſaical Aſcent, and cloſing Parallel.</p>

O what a memory has he left us, of having governed a Church and State, ſo as if it had been a clear copy of Heaven, and an eternal pattern of holy Policy: holding himſelf alwayes to thoſe heavenly Poles of piety and juſtice, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the great policy of the Univerſe; eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, as <hi>Democritus</hi> did, the two divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Weales publick, or great wheeles, upon which, all the affaires of the World were to move, ſo eſtabliſhing himſelf ſtill upon thoſe holy Columnes; as the one, has given him immortality with God, ſo the other has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated his memorial amongſt men!</p>

O what a memory has he left, of having ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times trampled the heads of Dragons under his feet, and rendered himſelf the wonder of the World!

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170384:165"/>
of his vertues, to the force of his armes, was alwayes of ſo vigorous and ſublime a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that he meaſured ſtill, all his moſt difficult undertakings, by the greatneſſe of his own courage, and like a <hi>Caeſar</hi> indeed, but more like a true <hi>Moſes,</hi> reſolved to break through all obſtacles, to Crown his inſpired pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
                  <p>O what a memory of a bleſſed death, in a good old age, and full fruition of all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours! to have died, as in a field of Palmes, and all planted with his own hand, manured with his conſtant induſtry, and water'd with his own painful ſweats!</p>
                  <p>O what a memory after death, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all, to have built himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, a moſt ſtately Tombe, ſtufft with the precious Stones, of his own moſt good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and incomparable vertues! all which right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now to repreſent, would require a recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation of all our Parallels, and take up a bulk bigger, than this ſmall Volume is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to bear. And it is enough I conceive to our preſent purpoſe, to ſay, that this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhall for ever preſerve the memory of him, as of a Prince, that has proved it poſſible, though miraculous, to hold a conjunction of piety, with the Supreme power, and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign authority, ſweetly tempered with good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, things before thought utterly incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible in Kings; and truly I know not, what juſt quarrel any man can have againſt his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, but that he hath ſhewed a path to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

men, and trod it by his own example, to prove it poſſible, to arrive at ſo much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and that may be a fault indeed, and worthy of exception, in ſo debaucht an age, as this.</p>
                  <p>But let ſuch unſavory breaths as theſe, blow how, and where they pleaſe, whileſt all the ſweet ones of the Nation, ſhall preſerve a fragrant memory of their departed Protector, and ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi>; ever acknowledgeing their lives and fortunes, nay the liberties of their very ſouls, to have been the pious purchaſe of his Princely pains.</p>
                  <p>Some impious great ones, we know, have brought a period upon the greateſt Empires, ruined whole Kingdoms, their people, and themſelves: have we not ſeen, I ſay, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in one for all, the great <hi>Roman</hi> Empire it ſelf, which had ſo many times, cauſed its victorious Chariots, loaden with Palms and Lawrels, to paſſe over the heads of the moſt puiſſant Monarchs of the World, that ſo often have been ſhaken, and ſo many times eſtabliſht by concuſſion; at laſt, by the interpoſition of one wicked unlucky Prince, or two, to be moſt irrecoverably entombed. How much are we engaged then to the precious memory of our late Lord Protector, who in the ſtaggering conditions, that our tottering ſtate at laſt, and Kingdom before was in, has not onely eſtabliſht but augmented the glories of our Nation; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing himſelf more amongſt us, and rendring
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170384:166"/>
himſelf more honorable to all the World, by thoſe his great actions, than all the Monarchs of <hi>Egypt</hi> could do, in all their rich Marbles, Pyramids and Obelisks.</p>
                  <p>What memory now, I would fain know, has that great <hi>Egyptian</hi> King <hi>Cleopes</hi> left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him? who proſtituted his own daughter, to raiſe himſelf a Pyramid for buryal, and it was ſo enormouſly great, as we read, that the earth ſeemed too weak to bear it, and Heaven not high enough, to free it ſelf from its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities: yet that, doating with age, has now forgot its founder, and he retains the ſtink of a rotten reputation, and is proclaimed by all the World, but a ſottiſh Prince for his pains.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pompey</hi> on the other ſide, we ſee, after he had meaſured three parts of the World, more by his triumphs than travails, comes to be killed at length, by the hand of a half man, and the earth which ſeemed too ſcanty and narrow for his conqueſts, was ſeen to fail him for a Tomb: and what memory have all his great actions acquired to him, but of a proud, bloody, imperious Common-wealths-man, that could endure no corrival in greatneſſe.</p>
                  <p>We have ſeen again in ſtory, a great <hi>Manlius,</hi> precipitated, from the Capitol, which once he had ſo bravely defended, that the Theater of all his glories, might be turned into the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold of his diſmal puniſhment: like that inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whom we have ſo often ſpoken of, which thought by the help of his falſe
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170384:166"/>
gods, to command the waves of the Sea, and to walk upon ſtars: yet periſht in thoſe his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry attempts, and was buried in execration and horrors. What which memory have any of theſe, or other wicked Princes left behind them, better than <hi>Eroſtratus</hi> before ſpoken of? No, nothing can erect a true monument of eternal memory, but pure Moſaick piety.</p>
                  <p>Our glorious ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> full well ſaw, that Royal Crowns themſelvs, did looſe their luſtre on heads without brains, and brows without Majeſty; and did much leſs regard a King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out piety, than a blind <hi>Cyclop,</hi> in an hollow cave.</p>
                  <p>Princes he knew there have been, and are ſtill in the World, born like <hi>Diadumenus,</hi> with a Diadem of honour in their foreheads, but moſt of them, we ſee, appear like <hi>Joſias,</hi> with a leproſie there too. O what a memory then muſt his late Highneſſe have left behind him? who is well known, to have been of the Lords own election, &amp; ſo much according to his own heart, that his ſervant <hi>Moſes</hi> and he, may ſtand in line Parallel; for juſt by ſuch means as he, we have ſeen how he came into the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, became the God of Monarchs, ruined the ſtate of his enemies, opened ſtormy Seas, manured Wilderneſſes, and cleft Rocks, with as ſmall a thing as a twig: juſt as he, he has been laborious amongſt Shepherds, ſanctified and exemplary in Cities, temperate in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, a Companion of Angels in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements, and as it were a Cabinet friend of God. Nay has our gracious ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi>
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:170384:167"/>
ſhewed leſſe piety in the ſervice of the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, leſſe ſweetneſſe in government, leſſe greatneſſe of ſpirit in all noble enterpriſes, leſſe patience in difficulties, leſſe prudence in the direction of his affairs, or leſſe diſpatch in his expeditions? And to conclude in ſhort, has he been leſſe bleſt in all his battails, having ever had, as it were, good hap, and victories, under his pay? and can we do leſſe than fall down, and worſhip divinity in all this, and give him the immortalitie of our memories at leaſt, in lieu of thoſe eternal obligations, that his moſt Serene Highneſſe has laid upon us? Nay have we not ſeen him all along, like his old Maſter <hi>Moſes</hi> too, holding Heaven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually for object, and all greatneſſe of this World in contempt? How like him too, he has alwaies ſhewed himſelf full of the ſpirit of all Prudence, Piety, and Propheſie it ſelf; and over and above all that, crowned with a moſt ſoveraign high humility? How he like him too, but moſt eſpecially toward his later end, had blotted one almoſt all, that was man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, by a converſation wholly celeſtial, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his fleſh into ſo much ſubjection, &amp; exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſpirit to ſuch an empire over it, that he might deſerve the name of God too, as his old Maſter <hi>Moſes</hi> did, in reſemblance of whom, he was ſo transformed, by the ſuperabudance of his moſt excellent, and celeſtial qualities? And has he not deſerved an immortality upon earth, for all this, as well as Crowns in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Yes ſure, for the moſt malicious enemy
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:170384:167"/>
that his Highneſſe has in the World, cannot deny him to have dyed, under the ſhadow of ſo many Palms, of his own moſt noble and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical vertues, that they muſt ſpring ſtill to all eternity, and grow green with very age: his Lawrels can never wither, nor his Bays be blaſted; the reſplendent raies of his honour, can never looſe their luſter, nor the odours of his holy converſation, ever fail of ſending forth their precious perfumes.</p>
                  <p>Thus has his moſt Serene Highneſſe, our ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> like the former, perfectly changed his Sepulcher into a Cradle, and even drawn life out of his Tomb. O what an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortallty is this, to ſurvive eternally in the mouths of men! But how much more happy an eternity is it, to have a perpetual life in Heaven, enjoying the very knowledge, love, life and felicity of God himſelf?</p>

Why being but a miſerable earthen pot, ſhould I argue againſt my Potter, for the faſhion, that he has pleaſed to put me in?
