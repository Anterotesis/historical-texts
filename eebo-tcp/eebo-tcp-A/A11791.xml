            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE trueſt and ſecurest precepts of <hi>Policie</hi> are thoſe, which either are drawen from the prudent reſolutions, or vnadviſed errors of great Princes in the deliberations of their most important affaires, or from the ſtudy of <hi>Policie;</hi> all conſisting in a ſevere, and iudicious cenſure of the actions of the <hi>Great:</hi> and the ſtudious in Histories, which haue the gift to know how to examine them well, draw out of them moſt excellent rules, for the wel-governing of many people: which being very true, it is no marvaile, if the best Writers of matters of State have growen extreamely odious to thoſe that raigne; by reaſon, that as Princes willingly lend an eare to the praiſes which happen to be given them, although they come from the pen, or mouth of an <hi>impudent Flatterer,</hi> ſo likewiſe they haue in exceeding abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation all cenſures which are made vpon their actions: it being an inſupportable miſerie vnto them, that their imprudence, and calamities, should ſerve for instructions vnto others, not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the like faults. This truth aſſures me, that theſe my preſent <hi>Advertiſements</hi> from <hi>Pernaſſus,</hi> (where in a ſporting manner the actions, interests, true ends, and defects of many Princes, not very iuſt, coming to be cenſured, touched, diſcovered, and noted) would bring them infinite diſpleaſure, if they should be openly published. Wherevpon, I, that at any hand will not give diſguſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17508:3"/>
to any perſon private or publike whatſoever, haue fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to keepe them from the Preſſe, as from the fire: for the length of time maturing things, that, which for infinite reſpects, in our Age is odious, the preſent Princes wanting, and thoſe affaires growing olde, which now liue: and that in regard of their importance are held in great ielouſie, I hope that theſe my Labours will then with particular liking bee read of the Vertuous, whom I indevour to pleaſe and delight: In the meane time I haue preſumed to hide theſe my Writings in your Lordships Librarie, vnto whom I preſent them, to the end they may be published to the world at ſuch time as they cannot giue distaſte to any one. But then my deſires shalbe accomplished, when theſe my Workes, ſuch as they are, may giue vnto your Lordship that ſatisfaction, which I ſo exceedingly deſire, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the infinite devotion I beare vnto your Name, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable obligations, wherein I ſtand ingaged vnto you, which haue created me a debtor vnto you in ſo great a ſumme, that if I should ſpend my whole life in your ſervice, yet I should thinke I had done nothing, but that ſtill I should die ingratefull.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17508:5"/>
it being the particular cuſtome of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to goe to viſit perſons more to iniure, then to honor them; and that therefore it ſeemed to them a kind of exceeding madnes, in ſtead of avoiding affronts, to attend them in their houſes, and reverently to receiue them vvith Cappe in hand. And albeit ſo potent a Monarchy to the great vvonder of all men had shevved herſelf much more ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, in giuing to others ſatisfaction of Titles, then in beſtovving her golden Piſtolets; nevertheles she hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from thoſe Princely Poets, and from all the Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Potentates, that more regard the ſubſtance, then the vanity of things, in this ſame titular buſines, as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent as she could deſire. Hovvbeit, the reputation of ſo great a Queen hath bin much blemished in this Court, by reaſon she is ſeen, notvvithſtanding the extreme neceſsity that lyeth vpon her for the acquiſition of friends, to shevv her ſelf too forvvard in alienating ſuch from her, as deſire nothing of her, but ſatisfaction of vvords. Further, it hath bin obſerved for a particular of much note, hovv the Mr. of the Ceremonies advertiſed her, that that great <hi>punto</hi> she ſo ſtands vpon, is an odious thing, onely proper to bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Kings, and moſt vnvvorthy ſo great a Lady, and ſuch a Princeſſe of <hi>Europe</hi> as she vvas: vvhereunto vvith much diſdaine she anſvvered, Hovv she vvondered that he, conſidering the place he held, should haue ſo litle vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, as not to knovv, that a Prince vvith out gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, shevveth like a Peacocke vvithout a tayle. It is not poſſible to vvrite, vvith vvhat curioſity and deſire this Princeſſe vvas expected, nor vvhat a concourſe of people came from all parts of <hi>Apolloes</hi> State, to looke vpon this povverfull Queene, that vvith ſuch a monſtrous courſe of felicity hath in ſo short a time vnited vnder her moſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17508:5"/>
ſpatious Kingdomes, and therof framed an Empire ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, that there is not a Prince in the vvorld, vvhich for ſuſpition of her hath not armed himſelfe. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of <hi>Spayne</hi> in compariſon of thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and other ancient Monarchies, is young in age, but of body farre bigger then any other vvhatſoeuer; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of yeres she is of, of an vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable greatnes: vvhence it is argued, that if she continue grovving vnto that terme, vvherein humane bodies are wont to come to their full perfection, she will become ſo great a Gyanteſſe, that she will arriue to that vnmeaſurable height of the Vniverſall Monarchies, wherunto the <hi>Rom. Monarchy</hi> attained: but the accidents of matters of State af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme for certain, that she wil neuer be bigger: and that she was as high in her tendreſt yeres, as euer she vvilbe in any time to come whatſoever. The which is plainly demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this apparant argument, that in theſe preſent times she hath grovven more ſlovvly halfe a fingers breadth, then she did tvvo handfulls in times paſt. This mighty <hi>Lady</hi> is of complexion very tavvny, much inclyning to the <hi>Moore:</hi> therefore her cuſtomes are rather proud, then graue; and in all her actions, hath more of the cruell, then the ſevere: ſo that not having beene able, nor deſirous to learne that art (ſo neceſſary for a Prince) of pardoning, it is the firme opinion of many, that thereby her greatnes is the more impeached: for placing her eſtimation vpon nothing more, then to be called the <hi>Mistris of Nations,</hi> in the knovvledge of being moſt reſolute to ſtrike off the heads of ſuch odious Poppies, as in the gardens of her States overtop their fellovves, she reioyceth not a litle, that she is ſaid in that ſort to haue gone beyond that <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi> the Great, vvho vvas the firſt inventor of ſuch a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17508:6"/>
Being then ſo reſolute in the execution of ſeuerities, she is much perplexed in conferring of graces, vvhich are ſeene to proceed very ſeldome from her; and thoſe too she doth, are granted vvith ſo much authoritie, as they are not very acceptable: Hovvbeit in apparance, she is all mildnes, and vvholly diſſolved into Complements: but he that vvith the politicall Spectacle knovveth hovv to penetrate into the invvard of the heart, shall diſcover her to be all pride, all covetouſneſſe, and cruelty; in ſuch ſort, that they vvhich haue long negotiated vvith her, report; That there is not any Princeſſe from vvhom come ſvveeter vvords, and bitterer deeds: vvhereby it happeneth, that as a friend she greatly allureth men, and as a Miſtres exceedingly terrifieth them.

She ſtandeth ſo much vpon the <hi>punto</hi> of State, that she vvill not vouchſafe to ſtirre a foot for to encounter good occaſions, vvhich many tymes haue gone home even to her ovvne doores to find her out. She goeth beyond all other Queenes vvhatſoever, either paſt or preſent, in the knovvledge hovv to cover vvith the cloake of hypocriſie any intereſt of hers, though neuer ſo diabolical: and albeit she is ſeene daily to enter into actions that are none of the beſt, yet she maketh oſtentation of nothing more, then of her Conſcience. Whence the <hi>French,</hi> ſo often deceiued vnder colour of moſt holy pretexts, haue at length to thier coſt learned to arme themſelues, and get to horſe, aſſoone as they once heare her propound matters full of pretences of Religion, and bleſſed Charitie tovvards her moſt beloved Neighbor. She is ſo excellent in the exerciſe of horſemanship, that she hath not only vvith good fortune tamed the generous Courſes of <hi>Naples,</hi> but alſo made gentle even thoſe moſt vitious mules of <hi>Spayne,</hi> that by their naturall inſtinct are ſo vvilde and vnruly. She is aboue all other Ladies moſt ſuſpitious, inſomuch that, her ovvne Nation excepted, she truſteth not any of all thoſe that are ſubiect vnto her, though vpon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons she hath proved them moſt faithfull: a matter of ſuch preiudice vnto her, that the vnderſtanding part of the vvorld plainly ſay, hovv for that only moſt important defect, it is not poſſible she should euer grovv greater: And this happeneth, becauſe no Prince living eareth leſſe then she to be loved of her people, placing all her ſtudy hovv to make her ſelf to be feared. Whereupon the <hi>Polititians:</hi> haue obſerved it as a kind of very great mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in her, to be ſo confidently perſwaded as she is, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17508:7"/>
she can dravv people to adore her by oppreſſing them: Nevertheleſſe, with theſe ſo odious Cuſtomes she allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all men vnto her ſervice, for the infinite abundance of her treaſures is that calamitie, which vvith ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence haleth vnto her even thoſe minds, that are bound to abhorre her. She is moſt accurate in petty things, but in great affaires no other Queene hath ſuffered herſelf to be more eaſily deceived. In diſcourſing of, and reſolving importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t matters, she sheweth admirable vnderſtanding and prudence; but either by her naturall ſloth, or the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of her miniſters, moſt covetous Marchants of great buſineſſes; or becauſe it ſeemeth vnto her, that no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution is made with <hi>Decorum,</hi> if it be not a long time expected by the World, she executeth her reſolutions vvith ſo much delay, that the face of affaires changing vvith the time, thoſe reſolutions which haue beene moſt prudently deliberated, haue often proved infortunate. And therefore it is the opinion of all men, that she is more able in laying of Plots, then in the managing of Armes, wherein she hath great courage, exceeding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, vnſpeakable patience of all diſcommodities: but ſo litle reſolution, that her extraordinary circumſpection hath many times the face of feare: whereupon she ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth more apt to maintaine, then conquer <hi>States.</hi> There are many ſingular men, that laugh at her, for ruling all her actions by ſuch ſolide and mature counſels, without ever venturing any in the hand of that Chance, and Fate vvhich haue ſo favoured, and made glorious the <hi>French,</hi> when as on occaſions they haue bene carried more by valor, then diſcretion: And ſome are of the minde, how that only proceedeth, from her being as ſparing of her owne bloud, as she is thirſty after others: Whence it is,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17508:7"/>
that the moſt vnderſtanding Captaines in the Art of warre, deride her, for aſpiring to the Empire of the World, and yet will neuer fight: for this mighty Queene being reſolved to make acquiſition of great States by marriages, she abhorreth that dreadfull cuſtome of the <hi>French,</hi> to buy others <hi>Kingdomes</hi> with the price of their owne bloud. Being then more adviſed then couragious, she is more dangerous to her friend in peace, then to her enemy in vvarre; wherefore the <hi>French,</hi> that hitherto haue liued with her in a ſupine negligence, haue at length, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo many calamities learned to double barre the doore when once they haue concluded a peace with the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</hi> She is moſt careleſſe of her owne, but ſo greedy of others riches, that she careth not to waſte her owne patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall eſtates, ſo as thereby she may get anothers. She is ſo cloſe, ſo reſerved, that it is not poſſible for any cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of man to find out her ends: but he that will iudge of the diſpoſition and cuſtomes of ſuch a Lady, muſt be fully perſwaded, that in all the affaires which either she manageth herſelfe, or others haue to negotiate with her, she is within quite contrary to that she appeareth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. And albeit that amongſt the aforeſaid vertues, she hath ſo notorious vices, yet by the greatneſſe of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune every thing in her is interpreted, and admired for Vertue: ſo that many wiſe Princes hold it an honor to imitate her, even in vices. She is of conſtitution very ſtrong: whereupon it is concluded, that she is long-liu'd, only she ſuffereth in the indiſpoſition of the diſtraction of her members; a matter that doth infinitely weaken ſo great a Body: and although with the ayde of the liberty of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and the alliance she hath with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> she vſeth many deviſes to vnite them: yet by the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity

            <p>I Know not whether it were by accident, or by the malice of ſome <hi>French-</hi>men, or indeed (as many haue grievouſly ſuſpected) by the plottings of that nation, which is ſuch an implacable enemy to the <hi>French:</hi> but ſo it was, that many yeares ſince, the Royall Palace of the Monarchy of <hi>France</hi> was ſet on fire, and ſo great was the Flame, and ſo terribly did it burne, that the neighbouring Monarchies were in extreame feare, leſt that fire wold end with the ruine of their States: in ſuch ſort, that for the preſervation of their owne, euery one ranne to the extinguishing of the flame of anothers houſe. The <hi>English,</hi> though natural enemies to the <hi>French,</hi> brought thither the waters of their <hi>Thames;</hi> the <hi>Germans</hi> thoſe of the <hi>Moſe,</hi> and of the <hi>Rhine;</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> emptied almoſt all their Lakes. And in truth it was a mervailous thing to ſee, that even the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> her ſelf, (eſteemed ſo cruell an enemy to the <hi>French)</hi> should la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour amongſt the chiefeſt friends, to extinguish that fire; whereas the common fame went, she would rather haue reioyced to haue warmed herſelfe at it: wherevpon euery one remained much aſtonished, when they ſaw, that with care, and vnſpeakeable charitie, she not only brought thither her waters of <hi>Tagus,</hi> and <hi>Iberus,</hi> but even the boundleſſe Ocean it ſelf; whereof, when the <hi>English,</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> will permit her, she is abſolute Miſtres. Howbeit, ſome <hi>Politicians</hi> ſiniſterly interpreting the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17508:10"/>
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> publikely affirmed, that it was a pernitious matter in the occaſions of the <hi>French</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who being eternall and capitall enemies to <hi>France,</hi> were rather to be recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Architects of euery <hi>French</hi> ruine, then zealous of the greatneſſe of that Kingdome as men, that meaſuring all the actions of thoſe, which raigne in the workes of Princes, with the only Compaſſe of their intereſt, many times doe not admit even pietie towards God, much leſſe charitie towards men. But theſe Politicians were ſo much the more held in abhomination with the world, by how much it was moſt apparant, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their diligence, and charitie to bring water vnto that fire, not onely equalled, but went beyond any friend whatſoeuer of the <hi>French:</hi> And that which encreaſed all mervaile, and brought high reputation to the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> with ſimple men, was, that <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> her ancienteſt patrimonies, burning with the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell flames of warre, she had preferred the ſafety of the <hi>French,</hi> before the care of her owne affaires. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neither humane labour, nor any quantity of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſufficient to extinguish the leaſt ſparke of ſuch a dreadfull fire, but rather the flames of thoſe bloudy ciuill warres, notwithſtanding all diligence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, daily more and more encreaſed; euen good men, and the deuouteſt Simplicities began to lend an eare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the adviſe of the Politicians, and to ſuſpect, that the charitie of the <hi>Spanish Monarchy</hi> was altogether <hi>intereſt,</hi> which indeed is right <hi>Spanish</hi> charitie; ſo that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved no longer to giue credit to apparences, but to looke into them, and ſee what matter it was, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> brought in their Barrels: and they found, that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17508:10"/>
in ſtead of water, to quench the fire, they were filled with Pitch, Oyle, Rozin, and diabolicall diſſentions, to encreaſe it; which treachery alſo ſome <hi>French</hi> Barons were diſcouered to vſe, who more then others making profeſſion of extraordinary charitie, employed thoſe Barrels, and the matter in them, lent them by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyards:</hi> Whereupon, vvith iuſt indignation they vvere ſlaine by the <hi>French Monarchy,</hi> and burned in the very ſame fire, vvhich vvith ſuch ſedition, and infidelity they had nourished in their Country. And the <hi>Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> were not onely chaſed away from that Worke, but vvith ſound of Trumpet proclaymed and published for Hypocrites; and by a particular Edict of the <hi>French Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> the World vvas made to know, that if ever in time to come, there vvere any one found, that could be induced to beleeue, how any kind of charitie could fall into the minds of the <hi>Spanyards</hi> towards the <hi>French,</hi> he should bee held, and reputed for a notorious Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity: and that, if after the firſt admonition he should perſeuere in his errour, as malicious, and ſeditious, hee should be toſſed in a Blanket.</p>
            <p>It vvas ſtrange to ſee, how the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> and thoſe <hi>French</hi> before-named, had no ſooner abſtained from that Worke, but that the inflammation of <hi>France,</hi> vvhich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vvas ſo great, that even men of the beſt iudgement affirmed, how it vvas not poſſible to bee extinguished by any humane meanes, ceaſſed of it ſelfe: Whereupon, the famous <hi>Flowers-de-luce</hi> of Gold ſo trampled on before, roſe vp more reſplendent and flourishing, then ever they vvere; and <hi>France,</hi> that through the exceſſiue ambition of many, had beene cruelly tormented for forty yeeres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and better, became (to the great marvaile of all men) quiet, and pacified in the twinckling of an eye: ſo
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17508:11"/>
that then it evidently appeared, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were the firſt Authors of that fire in <hi>France,</hi> which with ſuch farre pretences of Religion and charitie, they haue labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make the world beleeue they would ſo faine haue extinguished. It is generally reported, that the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> retired herſelfe into her Royall Palace, and how for a long time together she would not ſuffer her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be ſeene of any one, giuing her ſelfe over to a deepe Melancholy, and with abundance of teares freely acknowledging, that she would rather haue loſt two of the beſt Kingdomes she had, then ſee the vvorld con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, and deride thoſe holy pretences of hers, with which she had ſo often, to her infinite comodity, ſold even the moſt ſtinking <hi>Aſſafetida</hi> for Muſke, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergriece: for now it ſeemed vnto her that she remayned without her richeſt treaſure, and that she had loſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible Mynes of Gold and Siluer of <hi>Peru,</hi> and of all the new World, ſeeing she was depriued of the benefit of being able euer after to make the ſimple multitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that blacke was white; thinking it withall a very hard caſe to be driuen to that fearefull paſſe, wherein she had alwaies ſeene the <hi>French,</hi> that she muſt be forced to make acquiſition of Kingdomes, only with the point of the ſword; whereas in times paſt, with the ſole apparences of her holy pretexts, vvhich had ſerved her in ſtead of a moſt flourishing army, she had put the whole world into combuſtion: And that it exceedingly grieved her to be fallen into ſuch an ill opinion with men, that she was in danger for the time to come, not to be beleeued any more in the truth; vvhere before, the diſſimulation of falſe pretences, and of the openeſt Hypocriſie that might be, carried the credit of moſt ſacred Truth, and of moſt perfect Devotion.</p>

            <p>SEeing it is apparent, that the <hi>Romane</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, after the acquiſition it had made of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of all <hi>Italy,</hi> could in a short time arrive to that <hi>Vniuerſall Monarchy,</hi> which is yet ſo famous to the World, and whereunto many ambitious Princes haue ſince in vaine aſpired, it hath beene a generall receiued Opinion, That that Potentate, who in State and Forces is ſuffered to grow vnto ſuch greatneſſe, that hee findeth no other Prince able to counterpoyze him, no more then the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Common-weale did, after it became Commander over <hi>Italy,</hi> cannot poſſibly be impeached from obtaining the <hi>Vniverſall Monarchy.</hi> Whereupon thoſe Empires and Kingdomes, which were afterwards framed out of the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Romane Monarchy,</hi> to avoyd thoſe calamities and diſſolutions, which fell vpon ſuch Potentates as were oppreſſed by the <hi>Romane</hi> Forces, out of moſt wholeſome, and almoſt diuine counſell agreed together, that every fifteenth yeere, all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> should aſſemble into one place; where each ones Forces should bee ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally weighed; and thereupon fit counterpoyze, and due mortification be given vnto him, that was found to be growen to any greatneſſe, which might be odious and dangerous to his Competitor.</p>
            <p>Many great Wits were from time to time preferred to that honorable charge of governing the Scales; but for an
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17508:14"/>
hundreth yeres paſt or thereabout, they were managed by the Illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Medici,</hi> and in particular by <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo</hi> the Great. Which prerogatiue, although to many it ſeemed preiudiciall vnto the Maieſtie of the Popes, and prudence of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Senate, who haue alwayes wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; if not more, at leaſtwiſe equally with <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and the <hi>Florentine</hi> Commonweale, to maintaine both in Italy and abroad, the Forces of the Potentates of <hi>Europe</hi> even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballanced, yet with a marvailous conſent of all the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians the government of the Scales was given into the hands of Signior <hi>Lorenzo.</hi> The firſt day of <hi>August,</hi> then all the Princes and Potentates of <hi>Europe,</hi> aſſembled in <hi>Phocis,</hi> not only to meet with ſo important a buſineſſe as the perfect knowledge of their owne affaires, but that alſo of others, which in matter of State importeth much more. Whereupon, by an ancient and iuſt prerogatiue, the firſt that came to be weighed, was the <hi>Ariſtocraticall Monarchy</hi> of the <hi>Apostolicke Sea,</hi> whoſe temporall State was put into the Scale; and becauſe the weight of the laſt fifteenth yeere was but ſixe Millions of pounds, and now was found to amount vnto ſeuen &amp; an half, every one knew, that the addition of the noble Duchie of <hi>Ferrara</hi> had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that encreaſe. The next that was put into the Scale, was the State of the ſeuen Princes <hi>Electors</hi> of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, which by old Records appeareth to haue weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in times paſt ſeventy Millions of pounds; but ſince, by the indiſcreet governement and courſes of many Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, that luſty complexion, which made it evermore redoubted, was ſo ſpoyled, that it fell into thoſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and foule infirmities, which after a long Quartane, found end in an Hecticke Fever, that hath now ſo conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, as our Age beholdeth it left with nothing but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17508:14"/>
very skinne and bone. Howbeit, though it bee ſo much decreaſed in ſtate, yet the great bulke it hath of body, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it in shew very goodly to looke vpon; the rather, becauſe the intrinſecall imperfections are not diſcouered: for many good perſons with the ancient Titles of the Empire, and maieſticall Name of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> haue beautified it very excellently without, but when it came to bee weighed, it was found quite empty within; a feather not being ſo light, as the name of a Prince without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is vayne: whence it is, that the <hi>Romane Empire</hi> proved ſo weake, as it weighed but 480 pounds. Then the famous Peeres of <hi>France</hi> brought vnto the Scale the flourishing and warlike <hi>French Monarchy;</hi> a ſquare of fiue hundreth and fifty Miles every way, replenished with an infinit Nobleſſe, armed on horſebacke, which not onely maintaineth peace at home, but maketh ſo great a King formidable to all the Nations of the earth; beſides a world of learned men, which adorne it; Merchandiſe and Trades which enrich it; Tillage and Husbandry, which make it plentifull, and abounding with every good thing. The ancient weight of ſo famous a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy was twenty Millions of pounds; but in the laſt fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth yeeres weight, by reaſon of the horrible calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whereinto (by the diſloyalty of ſome of her Barons) she was throwen, it did not arriue to twelue Millions; howbeit now it not onely equalled, but went farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the weight of the beſt ancient times; for it came to fiue and twenty Millions; a matter of ſuch marvaile to everyone, that the <hi>Spanyards</hi> got on their Spectacles, and very narrowly obſerved, whether the Weights were right or no.</p>
            <p>To the ancient King<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dome of <hi>France</hi> was added the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17508:15"/>
of <hi>Breſſe</hi> given vp by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> which in regard it was ſo advantageous to the City of <hi>Lyons,</hi> augmented the weight of it aboue a Million. Next were the many Kingdomes of <hi>Spayne</hi> put into the Scale by the <hi>Spanish Grandes,</hi> and to the great wonder of thoſe ancient men, that could remember, how an hundreth and twenty yeres ſince, they were held in a poore and vile account, the weight amounted to twenty Millions. The <hi>Spanyards</hi> remained exceeding well ſatisfied with this weight of their <hi>Spayne:</hi> and aſſured themſelues, that with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo many other States, they had beſides to put into the Scale, not onely to equall, but farre to exceed the fiue and twenty Millions of the <hi>French Monarchy.</hi> VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſtantly they put into the Scale the flourishing Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> which every one thinking would encreaſe the weight at leaſt two Millions more; it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that then it weighed leſſe by one and an halfe: at this ſtrange accident the <hi>Spanyards</hi> being much ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, ſayd: That either <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had vſed ſome fraud in the weighing, or that of neceſſitie the Scales were not even; becauſe it was a monſtrous thing, that the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of matter should abate of the weight. Whereunto <hi>Lorenzo</hi> coldly anſwered; That his Scales were even; but that neither the <hi>Indiaes</hi> voyd of inhabitants, nor the <hi>Neopolitans,</hi> and <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> which were ſo farre diſtant from the Forces of <hi>Spayne,</hi> and replenished with a people, which ſo vnwillingly ſupported the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ſtrangers, weighed any thing at all: for it was the loue and multitude of ſubiects, the fertility and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of States, that giue weight, and turne the Scale.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> added the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Scale, which in like manner abated a Million of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17508:15"/>
the weight; whereat alſo the <hi>Spanyards</hi> were ſo much aſtonied, that they would not put <hi>Flanders</hi> into the Scale, fearing to receiue a greater diſtaſte and affront. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſome ſayd, that if they had put in the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> they might haue wrought ſome good effect, but not thoſe miracles, which certaine lavish toungs have delivered; who with the ſame facility talke of Millions of Crownes that the furnace-men make of very bricke and tyle. Then came the <hi>English Lords,</hi> who put into the Scale their Kingdome, ſo much redoubted for the ſtrength of the wonderfull ſcytuation thereof; for the continued Mountaynes, which compaſſe it about ſerving for walles, made by the very powerfull hand of God in forme of bulwarks, and the Ocean for moſt profound ditches, make it a Kingdome feared, in regard of the commodity it hath to aſſayle others; and the inſuperable difficulties, which they shall finde, that offer to attempt it. The weight of this Kingdome was anſwerable to that of the laſt fifteenth yeare, which amounted to ſixteene Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions. But the <hi>English</hi> to giue more weight to their Kingdome, would haue put the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> into the Scale; when the <hi>Scottish Nobilitie</hi> with drawen ſwords in their hands oppoſed themſelues; freely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting, that they would never ſuffer their Country to be annexed to the Kingdome of the <hi>English;</hi> for yet fresh was the lamentable example of the miſeries of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who when she ſaw her Earles become Kings of <hi>Spayne,</hi> foolishly beleeved that shee should command o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Spanyards;</hi> whereas ſoone after, not <hi>Spayne</hi> was ſacked by the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> but <hi>Flanders</hi> by the covetous and cruell <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and that which made vp their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth the Emperor, and King <hi>Philip</hi> his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17508:16"/>
ſonne, by their continuall reſidence in <hi>Spayne,</hi> of <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings</hi> became <hi>Spanyards.</hi> The vnfortunate <hi>Flemmings</hi> by loſing their Prince, of naturall ſubiects, grew to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſtrangers, and men of little faith. And ſo <hi>Flanders,</hi> the naturall Country of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, the Patrimony of King <hi>Philip,</hi> became (according to the termes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Policie) a State of fiue States, and began to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by ſtrangers; with thoſe jealouſies, and with thoſe oppreſſions of Cuſtomes, Taxes, Contributions, and Donatiues, as begat thoſe bad humors, thoſe ill ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions, from whence ſince hath proceeded that ciuill warre, which after an vnſpeakable profuſion of Gold, an infinite effuſion of bloud, an incredible loſſe of honour to the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> was converted into a covetous mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of the <hi>Spanyards.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Scots</hi> by ſuch lamentable miſeries haue learned, not to permit their King vpon any termes whatſoever, to abandon the Royall Seate of his ancient Kingdome, for to place it in a greater, newly fallen vnto him: in which caſe the <hi>Scots</hi> should vnder their cruell enemies the <hi>English,</hi> be ſure to ſuffer all the calamities, which inferiour Nations are wont to endure at the hands of the ſuperiour.</p>
            <p>Some that were preſent at this Act report, how the <hi>Spanyards</hi> told the King of <hi>England,</hi> that thoſe <hi>Scots</hi> which had ſpoken ſo arrogantly in the preſence of his Majeſtie, were to be ſeuerely chaſtiſed; to whom the King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> anſwered, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ought not to giue that counſell vnto others, which had proved ſo pernicious to themſelues: and thereupon hauing commanded the ſtay of weighing their Kingdome, hee aſſured his <hi>Scots,</hi> that ere long he would giue them all poſſible ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>After this, the vaſt <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire was put into the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17508:16"/>
Scale; which the laſt fifteenth yeare arrived to the ſumme of two and thirtie Millions, but now was found to be leſſe then ſixteene; the ſtrangeneſſe whereof made all the Princes very much to marvaile; and particularly the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who could not beleeue ſuch a fall; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they deſired, that with more diligence it might be reweighed; and it appeared, how in that litle time run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning betweene the firſt and this ſecond weighing, it had fallen eight hundreth twenty and two pounds; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it was manifeſt, that the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, heretofore ſo terrible to the world, now conſumed with luxury, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetuousneſſe, and idleneſſe, runneth headlong to his ruine, which gaue great contentment to all thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Nevertheles, it was obſerved by ſome of the wiſeſt there preſent, that the <hi>Spanyards</hi> were not ſo glad of it as the reſt; out of a doubt they had, that the depreſſion of the <hi>Turke,</hi> would be the exaltation of the <hi>Venetian</hi> State. Then came the <hi>Polach</hi> Senators, and put into the Scale their Kingdome, which in regard of the ſmall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie the King hath there, and the too much command, which the <hi>Palatines</hi> arrogate vnto themſelues, made but a poore reckoning; for it did not amount to ſix Millions of pounds, whereas in times paſt it alwayes exceeded twelue. After them, the Signory of the Councell of <hi>Tenn</hi> put into the Scale the flourishing eſtate of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Commonwealth, moſt admirable for the greatneſſe thereof, and oportunitie of ſcituation fitting for all great enterpriſes, which went beyond all expectation in the weight, for it came to eight Millions; the cauſe whereof was ſayd to be the huge maſſe of Gold, which thoſe wiſe <hi>Senators</hi> in ſo long a time of peace had gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red togither into their Treaſury. Next came the <hi>Switt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:17508:17"/>
the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and other free people of <hi>Germany,</hi> and brought their Comonweales to the Scale. How beit the Princes required, that they might be weighed each one ſeverally by it ſelfe, wherewith the <hi>Germanes</hi> were well contented, ſo that it might be done. But <hi>Lorenzo</hi> having put the Commonwealth of <hi>Baſil</hi> into the Scale, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the greater part of the other Common weales of <hi>Germany</hi> were all ſo linked together, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſeperate them one from another, which put a many of ambitious Princes there in a ſweate. Then the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> cauſed his State to be put into the Scale by his noble Knights of the <hi>Annonciata,</hi> which equalled the weight of the laſt fifteenth yeare; but <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> having added into the Scale that moſt noble prerogatiue of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which the ſayd Duke <hi>Charles Emanuell</hi> enioyeth of the Prime Souldyer of <hi>Italy,</hi> it was ſeene to aggravate the weight a Million foure hundreth and twenty pounds. After this, with a pompe and Maieſtie matchable to Kings, appeared the Duke of <hi>Lorraine;</hi> whoſe State, though litle, equalled the weight of great Kingdomes; and it was conſidered that it fell out to be ſo by a certaine good fortune which that Prince had, to haue his States ſo happily ſeated, that he could eaſily put the <hi>Lowe-Countreys</hi> into grievous difficulties, by impeaching the paſſage of thoſe ſuccors, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> conduct thither out of <hi>Italy,</hi> whereby he hath growen into ſuch reputation, that to the moſt offerer he ſelleth for ready Gold the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of that his adhering; in ſuch ſort, that after he had dreyned the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> aſmuch as any the devouteſt <hi>French</hi> Lord of the <hi>Holy League</hi> whatſoever, ſyding after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with the <hi>French,</hi> he knew ſo well how to change his coppy, that a King of <hi>France,</hi> ſuch as was <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17508:17"/>
the great Duke of <hi>Toſcan,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> were glad of his allyance. And fully to make vp the <hi>Spanyards</hi> iealousye, the famous <hi>Venetian</hi> Commonwealth drew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her pay a Prince of that Houſe with ſuch affection, that if that great <hi>Lady</hi> had not made a vow of perpetuall cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, and her nature (according to the cuſtome of ſome <hi>Indians,)</hi> had not bene ſtytched vp the firſt day she was borne by the <hi>Venetian Signory,</hi> moſt jelous of her honor, it was verily beleeved by many, that she would haue taken him to huſband. It was obſerved, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> envyed much the felicity of this Prince; becauſe he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe alſo ſeated betweene the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spanyards</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> as the Duke of <hi>Loraine</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spanyards</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> in ſtead of ſo many benefits, and ſo many commodities, as fell vpon the Duke of <hi>Loraine,</hi> he had received moſt cruell kickes, not onely from the <hi>French</hi> then his enemies, but from the <hi>Spanyards</hi> his friends; ſo that it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> did now plainly ſee, how that practiſe of his with the <hi>Spanyard,</hi> was moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious for him. Then came the <hi>Otto di Balia,</hi> and put into the Scale the flourishing State of the Great Dukes of <hi>Tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </hi> which by reaſon of the excellent wits of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, perpetuall plenty, continuall peace, and quiet ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it enioyeth, anſwered in weight to many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> greatly reioyced, when he ſaw how vpon the foundations of thoſe Churches and Hoſpitals, which he and his Predeceſſors in the time of the <hi>Florentine</hi> liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie had layed in their Countrey, their Succeſſors, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the modell left them by <hi>Coſimo</hi> the Great, had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards found meanes to erect ſtrong Cyttadels; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> to make a glorious shew of the worth and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17508:18"/>
wiſedome of the Princes of his Houſe, added into the Scale the admirable vnderſtanding of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Great, with the exceſſiue weight whereof it was ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, that the huge chayne whereby it hung brake in two, ſo that all went to ground. This accident of the Scales ſo broken, was an hinderance that other <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, which remayned, could not be weighed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it was concluded, that comming, according to the ancient cuſtome, to lay all the Princes and Potentates of <hi>Italy</hi> in ballance againſt the Monarchy of <hi>Spaine,</hi> out of the vniverſall weight of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, each ones per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular would eaſily appeare.

            <p>YEſterday morning two houres before day, the renowned <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Spayne</hi> departed with great ſecrecy, in a Caroch of ſixe horſes from <hi>Pernaſſus,</hi> carrying along with her onely ſome few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates of her Court, which begate a world of jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; but in particular the <hi>French Monarchy</hi> was ſo mooved, that to be aſcertained of this voyage, she preſently tooke Poſte, and following the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Spayne,</hi> shee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke her iuſt as shee was entring into the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Delphos;</hi> before whom preſenting herſelfe, by report of them that by chance were then preſent, shee made this enſuing requeſt: O eternall, and cleare Lampe of the world; thou right Eye of Heaven, that not onely bringeſt day, but every good elſe to mankind: Thou knoweſt, that for a long time together, all my thoughts haue aymed at that <hi>Vniverſall Monarchy,</hi> whereunto the <hi>Romane</hi> people onely arrived: Thou knoweſt what effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of bloud, what profuſion of Treaſure I haue made, to attaine vnto the end of my intent: To thee onely are knowen the watchings, the ſweat, and thoſe ſo arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall endevours of mine which I have vſed, to bring ſo important a Deſeigne to paſſe: Thou knoweſt alſo, that by the valour of my Nation, by the dexterity of my
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17508:19"/>
wit, and by the power of my money, not many yeeres ſince, at ſuch time, as I had ſowen thoſe turbulencies of ciuill warres in <hi>France,</hi> whereon I had grounded all my hopes, I was neere vnto the obtaining of my intent; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remaining for me to overcome all impediments, but to vnite <hi>Naples</hi> with <hi>Milan;</hi> a difficulty, which if I can once ſurmount, I may then ſecurely boaſt that I haue gotten the day: But ſeeing that either by my fatall miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, or by the impoſſibility of the affayre, or by the power of ſo many cruell enemies, which declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt mee, the ſcandals of thoſe revolutions, which with ſuch deviſes in the ſpace of ſo long a time, I had ſowen amongſt the <hi>French,</hi> over whom yet I could never prevaile, were in one onely day converted into ſuch peace and tranquilitie, as it breaketh my heart to behold it; and that after the waſting of ſo many of my people, whom in this enterpriſe, that I haue propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to my ſelfe, I haue almoſt reduced to vtter deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I am in the end become euen the fable of the world: Therefore doe I thus preſent my ſelfe before thy Majeſtie, whom I moſt humbly beſeech, to let mee clearely vnderſtand, whether that <hi>Vniverſall Monarchy,</hi> which is ſo imprinted in my heart, and which is the only end of all my actions, bee deſtinated by the will of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to me, and my Nation: and this I deſire to know, that either by the impoſſibility of the matter, I may bee conſtrayned to give it over, or by the poſſibility thereof, I may encourage my <hi>Spanyards</hi> to goe on cheerefully in their attempts: for to confeſſe the truth vnto thee, that knoweſt the ſecrets of thoughts, in regard of ſo many croſſes, which both by Sea and Land I have endured; in regard of ſo many Conſpiracies and Counterplots which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17508:20"/>
by my implacable enemies have beene contrived, and now more then ever are contrived againſt me, I beginne wholy to deſpaire and ſaint.</p>
            <p>After this requeſt, the Temple shooke, and the earth trembled, when from the mouth of <hi>Apollo's</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter came theſe words: The <hi>Vniverſall Monarchy</hi> shall returne anew to the noble <hi>Italian</hi> Nation, when it shall give over thoſe inteſtine diſcords, which have made it a ſlave to Strangers. Vpon ſo ſad an anſwere, the <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> of <hi>Spayne</hi> full of griefe departed out of the Temple, and much she marvailed, when shee ſaw the <hi>French Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> preſent her ſelfe before her; with whom having vſed her wonted Complements, shee drew her aſide, and declaring vnto her, what anſwere shee had received from the Oracle; shee informed her, that if the <hi>Vniverſall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> should returne againe to the <hi>Italian</hi> Nation, <hi>France</hi> would quickly be as ſure to feele a new <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> as <hi>Spayne</hi> a ſecond <hi>Scipio;</hi> and therefore to ſecure their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, there was no ſuch way, as to divide <hi>Italy</hi> betweene them. Shee alſo offered to teach her the ſame Receipt, which shee had ſo happily experimented in the <hi>Indiaes,</hi> wherewithall they might ſo aſſure themſelves of the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Nation, that there should remaine no more of that wicked race of men in the world, then the bare name. Let me firſt forget (anſwered then the <hi>French Monarchy)</hi> that vnlucky deviſion of the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> which my king <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth made not long ſince with you, and then we will talke of this buſineſſe: For it is not ſo eaſy a matter to wrong the <hi>French</hi> a ſecond time, as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue you perſwade your ſelfe it is. As for the receipt, which (to be ſecured of the <hi>Italians)</hi> you propound vnto me, I pray you vſe it your ſelfe; for to ſpoyle the earth of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17508:20"/>
people (as you haue done in the <hi>Indiaes)</hi> and to raign over naked Countreys voyd of inhabitants, is a certaine poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Precept, which is not found in the <hi>French</hi> reaſon of State; for I haue learned to my coſt to content my ſelfe with a litle, ſo it be good; and therefore I place my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe more in the multitude of Subiects, then in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Kingdomes; and ſo as my <hi>French</hi> may liue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly in this world, I am well pleaſed that others shall doe ſo too. Moreover, with that libertie, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to my nature, I will freely tell you, that the ſubduing of all <hi>Italy,</hi> is not an enterpriſe ſo facile as you imagine; for when I was of your humor, I know how pernicious it proved to me; and therefore be warned by my experience, not to attempt that, which in the end will bring you nothing but loſſe, and diſgrace.</p>

            <p>THe famous King of <hi>Moores, Almanſor;</hi> he that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares togither raigned in <hi>Spayne</hi> over the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Realme of <hi>Granada,</hi> met yeſterday with the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> and falling in talke with him, after he had for a good ſpace obſerved the chayne, which the ſayd Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> wore faſtned about his legge, he told him, that the manufacture thereof being <hi>Moreſco,</hi> he verily thought that he had many times ſcene, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it ſome where els; and a litle while after with a shew of great marvayle he affirmed, that he knew it well; and how it was the very ſame, wherewith all both he, and the <hi>Moorish</hi> Kings his Predeceſſors had for the ſpace of ſeven hundreth yeares held many Kings of <hi>Spayne</hi> in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude; and therefore he earnſtely entreated him, to let him vnderſtand, how, by whom, and when he was chay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that manner. A very good eye, and an excellent memory haſt thou, <hi>Almanſor;</hi> (anſwered then the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Naples)</hi> for this vnlucky chayne, which thou ſeeſt about my legge, was brought out of <hi>Spaine</hi> by <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalvo Corduba,</hi> called the great Captaine, and therefore it is very likely to be the ſame thou ſpeakeſt of. And now it is an hundreth yeares, ſince firſt I found my ſelfe in the miſerable ſervitude, wherein thou beholdeſt me, and from
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17508:21"/>
which I know not whither ever I shall be freed; for in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the mighty power, whereunto I ſee the ſorces of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> arrived, having vtterly loſt all hope of aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that may be expected from men, I know, that my ancient libertie ſtandeth wholly in the poewrfull hand of God, who had need to renew in me the miracles of the Red-Sea, if my deliverance shall follow. The yeares (replyed <hi>Almanſor)</hi> confront well; for a litle before the time of thy ſervitude, the <hi>Spanyards</hi> vndid this my chayne from about the legge of the Kingdome of <hi>Granada,</hi> where withall afterwards they bound thee. But let it not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe thee, O Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> to declare vnto me, how it could come to paſſe, that the <hi>Spanyards</hi> should make themſelues Maſters of ſuch a Kingdome as thou art, ſo potent, and ſo farre diſtant from their Forces. By fraud <hi>Almanſor,</hi> (ſayd the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Kingdome) did the <hi>Spanyards</hi> get into <hi>Italy,</hi> for by open force they had never beene able to make ſuch notable acqueſts; and as thou ſaydeſt well, ſo diſproportionable to their Forces, which vvere ſo farre off. But heare, and vvonder at the large and groſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of a King of <hi>Spayne</hi> in matters of State, although he vſed much art to ſeeme vnto foolish men a very Saint; for thou shalt come vnto the knowledge of a Tragedy, according to the rules of my Chriſtian Religion, moſt vvicked and cruell; but according to the termes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Policie, the moſt adviſed, that ever any Nation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented vpon the Stage of the vvorld. <hi>Alfonſo</hi> my King, to his vtter, and my chiefeſt ruine, gaue <hi>Iſabella</hi> his Niece (for from this vnhappy marriage did my diſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation take beginning) to <hi>Iohn Galeazzo,</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> for vvife. The minortie firſt, and then the vnſpeakeable ſilly weakeneſſe of ſo infortunate a Prince incouraged
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17508:22"/>
               <hi>Lodovico Sforza</hi> to vſurpe the State vpon his Nephew; <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> as it behoved him, ſought to hinder that Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; vvhere of <hi>Lodovico</hi> being aware, and knowing, that without the ruine of my Kings, it vvas not poſſible for him to arriue vnto the end of his moſt injuſt deſire, he fell into that reſolution, vvhich afterwards both to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to me, and to all the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> proved ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, of drawing the <hi>French</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> to the conqueſt of me. My Kings to defend themſelues from ſuch mighty enemies, called to their ayde that holy ſoule of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Aragon</hi> their Couſin, who shewed himſelfe ſo kind a kinſman, and ſuch a faithfull friend, that in ſtead of chaſing avvay the <hi>French</hi> enemies, he divided me with them; and to shew himſelfe compleat, a little after this vnhappy diviſion, he entred into warres againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and having overcome them, he forced them to returne full of shame, and loſſe into their countrey; vvhereupon the good King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> without any ſcruple at all of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience became my abſolute Lord; and then it was, that he faſtned this chayne about my legge, which thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreſt to be the manufacture, and worke of thy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And I do not thinke, that in all the Chronicles of the <hi>Saracens, Moores, or Turks,</hi> vvhich it is likely thou haſt read, there was ever a more vvicked treachery recorded, done by a King, that deſired to be reputed a man of a good conſcience, and of an holy diſpoſition; and that a litle before had receiued of the Apoſtolicke Sea that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious title of the moſt <hi>Catholike King.</hi> Truly (replyed <hi>Almanſor)</hi> in the Chronicles, which thou haſt named of my Nation, many foule actions co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by divers Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces out of ambition to raigne, may be read, but this which thou haſt recounted of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> goeth beyond them
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17508:22"/>
all. But if thou, O <hi>Almanſor,</hi> (ſayd the Kingdome of <hi>Naples)</hi> diddeſt with thy Nation keepe the Kingdome of <hi>Granada,</hi> chayned ſo many hundreth yeares, vvhat courſe tooke the <hi>Spanyards</hi> for to free him? That Vnion of the Kingdomes of <hi>Castile</hi> and <hi>Aragon</hi> (replyed <hi>Almanſor)</hi> which followed vpon the marriage between <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> occaſioned the libertie of the Kingdome of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada:</hi> a moſt vnhappy Vnion, the which, no leſſe then I haue done, and continually ſtill doe, the greateſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates of <hi>Europe,</hi> haue lamented, doe lament, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually with vnfained teares vvill lament; as that, which is the true and onely roote, from vvhence are ſprung all thoſe greateſt ſubverſions of States, which vnto this day haue beene ſeene in many partes of <hi>Europe,</hi> but more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeably in <hi>Italy.</hi> And beleeue me, <hi>Neapolitan</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that even till now might I haue raigned happily in <hi>Spayne,</hi> if this peſtiferous Vnion had not overthrowen my greatneſſe; for the many jealouſies that raigned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> and <hi>Aragonians,</hi> were my inexpugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cittadels, which would haue maintayned my raigne here for ever. Withall aſſure thy ſelf, O Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> that the aydes which the Popes gaue to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and Queene <hi>Iſabella,</hi> greatly accelerated my taking in. Peace, peace, <hi>Almanſor</hi> (ſaid then the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Kingdom) for after thou wert chaced out of <hi>Spayne</hi> by the ambitious <hi>Spanish</hi> Nation, the Popes vndervvent ſuch miſeries, that it may be truly ſayd, how with ready mony they bought thoſe extreame calamities, wherewithall afterwards they encountred; for though the Sea Apoſtolicall were well contented to ſee the <hi>Moores</hi> driven out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> yet that ſatisfaction was much diſſaſted with my ſervitude, which followed preſently vpon it, the Popes having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

had any thing in greater feare, then that I should fall into the hands of a mighty Prince, vvho might make them liue in thoſe perpetuall jealouſies, vvherein finding themſelues drowned even vp to the very eyes, many of them, and particularly thoſe, that haue a greater know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things of the vvorld, do not alwayes make quiet ſleepes. A cleare teſtimony of the truth which I ſpeake, was the lamentable and wicked ſacke of <hi>Rome,</hi> perpetrated by the <hi>Spanyards</hi> a litle after my ſervitude; with which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude they payd the Apoſtolicke Sea for all they were debtors vnto it, aſwell for the remiſſion of the Tribute of <hi>Naples,</hi> as for the other ſuccors, which they received in the vvarre of <hi>Granada.</hi> A calamitie, that having paſt the termes of moſt grievous miſeries, hath in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner opened the eyes even of men of the drowſieſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that every one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth clearely to know, what it is to vnchayne the Lyon out of a zeale of pietie; for the <hi>Spanyards</hi> no ſooner ſaw themſelues freed from the impediment of the <hi>Moores</hi> of <hi>Granada,</hi> but that through the ambition, which they shewed in deſiring to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand over the whole Vniverſe, not onely in <hi>Italy,</hi> but through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Europe,</hi> moſt important jealouſies of State, and moſt grievous intereſts of Religion diſcovered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, in ſo much, that I haue often heard it diſcourſed by men of moſt vnderſtanding in affayres of the vvorld, how peradventure it would haue beene leſſe prejudiciall for many Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> that thou haddeſt raigned ſtill in <hi>Granada,</hi> then that the <hi>Spanyards</hi> should haue paſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy,</hi> to acquire ſuch important States, as at this day they poſſeſſe there.</p>
            <p>Hereunto may be added the prejudices both publike and priuate, which my ruine hath brought, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17508:23"/>
doth bring vnto the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, and more particularly to the Popes, becauſe the Kings of <hi>Spayne</hi> had no ſooner faſtned this Chayne about my legge, but preſently they began to aſpire vnto the Dominion of all <hi>Italy;</hi> and the quicklier to arriue thereunto, they knew very excellently how to intereſſe themſelves in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, which at that time depended betweene the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> about the poſſeſſion of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> wherein that top of man, <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, carried himſelfe in ſuch ſort, that hee made himſelfe to bee knowen the worthy Nephew of his Grandfather by the Mothers ſide: for having with the Forces of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, chaſed the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> inſtead of reſtoring the <hi>Sforzi</hi> to the State, as it was agreed betwixt him, and the confederate Princes, with the fraud of a thouſand Turkish quarrels pickt of purpoſe, which he well knew how to invent againſt the <hi>Sforzi,</hi> he made himſelfe abſolute Maſter of that ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a Dutchy. Stay, Kingdome of <hi>Naples;</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a point here, (ſayd <hi>Almanſor)</hi> ſatisfie me in this: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the noble State of <hi>Milan</hi> was fallen into the hands of the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> what hindred them from running preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitouſly to the acquiſition of all <hi>Italy?</hi> and ſeeing thy ſervitude doth manifeſt vnto the world, that the aydes and ſuccours of Princes, ſerue more for the benefite of him that giveth them, then for the profit of him that receiveth them, why would not the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes rather ſuffer, that <hi>Milan</hi> should be vnder the Dominion of the <hi>French,</hi> then by receiving ayde from the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> runne the danger of letting that Dutchy, (beeing ſo important a member of <hi>Italy)</hi> fall into the hands, as thou ſaydeſt it did, of the Kings of <hi>Spayne?</hi> The power of the Kings of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17508:24"/>
               <hi>France</hi> (anſwered the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Kingdome) defendeth that remnant of Liberty which remaineth in <hi>Italy,</hi> from the ambition of <hi>Spaine:</hi> for thoſe glorious Kings out of the intereſt of their greatneſſe will not endure, that the Dominion of all <hi>Italy</hi> should fall into the power of the ambitious <hi>Spanish</hi> Nation, which cannot extinguish the ardent thirſt they have of commanding, neither with the Conqueſt of all the new World diſcovered by them, nor with ſo great a part which they poſſeſſe in the old.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, who know the great perill (wherein they finde they are) of a dangerous and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſervitude, have ſo vnited themſelves together, that although they be many in number, yet make they but one Body; and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who haue vſed, and doe vſe all poſſible deviſes to diſ-unite them, evidently perceive, that they wash a Black-Moore.</p>
            <p>But touching the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> thou muſt know, how it was iudged more ſecure for the publike Liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi> that that Dutchy should fall into the power of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> then that it should remaine in the hands of the <hi>French;</hi> who for that they were ioyning to <hi>Italy,</hi> when therein they should poſſeſſe any little part, there would haue beene manifeſt danger, that they would haue made themſelves abſolute Lords of the whole: but in the <hi>Spanyards</hi> it would fall out cleane contrary; for their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, albeit very great, are notwithſtanding ſo farre off, that by ſo long a tract of ſea, they could with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty tranſport out of <hi>Spayne</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> Forces, that were able to maintaine the acqueſts they had made, not that they could be ſufficient to ſubdue the whole.</p>
            <p>Thou ſpeakeſt the truth, (ſayd then <hi>Almanſor)</hi> but goe on, and declare vnto me the prejudices, which thy fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17508:24"/>
into the hands of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> brought vnto the Popes. Know then, (replyed the Kingdome of <hi>Naples)</hi> that whereas before, the Popes were the terror of my Kings, now it happeneth to bee cleane otherwiſe; for they liue in a very great agony, leſt the Vnion of <hi>Milan</hi> with <hi>Naples</hi> should one day follow; to which marke, they obſerue, the <hi>Spanyards</hi> haue directed the ſcope of all their thoughts; vvhereupon the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> whoſe proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is to make good vſe of the feare, vvhereinto they ſee they haue put the Princes their neighbours, haue ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated vnto themſelves ſuch authority in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they vaunt they are the true arbitrators of all the moſt important matters, vvhich there are handled. Moreover, when the Kings of <hi>Naples</hi> were not Kings of <hi>Spayne,</hi> the Popes with every litle menace of denying the inveſtiture, obtayned of my Kings, Principalities, Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyes, Earldomes, and other great States in gift, buying their friendships alſo with mariages, and many other ſortes of liberalitie; but now, the feare being ceaſed, if the Popes vvil make their kinred great with titles of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant States, they muſt be glad to buy them with their ready mony, and the adviſed Kings of <hi>Spayne,</hi> beſides the pretious Gold of entreaties, which at any hand they will bee ſure shall precede for a firſt payment, ſell them vnto them thoroughly ſawced. Important intereſts, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous diſorders are theſe (ſayd <hi>Almanſor)</hi> vvhich thou haſt recounted vnto me; but how cometh it that thou, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Naples,</hi> which art the Magazine of Silkes, the Granary of <hi>Italy,</hi> shouldeſt goe ſo ragged, and be ſo leane? Seeing the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> that come naked out of <hi>Spayne</hi> [an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Kingdome of <hi>Naples]</hi> after they haue beene three or foure dayes in my houſe, will needs cover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

all over with gold, it is no marvaile if I be ſpoyled, to clothe ſo many Raggedemuffins: beſides, if thou ſaweſt the rapacitie of the Vice-roys, that to recover them ſelves are ſent vnto me, or if thou kneweſt the rapines of Secretaryes, of thouſand Officers, and other Courtiers, which they bring along with them, all thirſty of my bloud, thou wouldeſt greatly marvayle, how it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, I should ſatiare the raging, and greedy ſwallow of ſo many hunger-ſtarved wretches.

            <p>THe illuſtrious, and reuerend <hi>Franceſco Cordova,</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Toledo,</hi> a perſonage of exemplarie life, an exquiſite Divine, and excellent Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher; hee that in his owne perſon honoured the Word of God in the Pulpit more then any other Preacher whatſoever of his time, ſome few dayes ſince arrived at <hi>Pernaſſus,</hi> having beene received vpon the confines of the State, by <hi>Aleſsandro d' Ales,</hi> and <hi>Cornelio Muſſo</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bitonto,</hi> and all the way entertayned at his Majeſties charge. This honorable learned man preſented his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings vnto the venerable Colledge of the <hi>Vertuous;</hi> and thoſe of Philoſophie were not only commended, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired; as alſo the Commentaries compoſed by him vpon the divine paſſages of all the ſacred Writers, were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with extraordinary applauſe, and shortly after they were carried in a precious Vrne vnder a cloth of Eſtate, into the <hi>Delphicke</hi> Library, and with the name of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor conſecrated to Eternity. Onely his <hi>Summa,</hi> although very learned, was not received by thoſe <hi>Vertuous,</hi> who freely told him, that there were ſo many Workes already of that kinde in his Majeſties Library, as ſome of them ſeemed ſuperfluous: for an infinit many of great Divines had with ſuch diligence handled matters appertayning to the conſciences of private men, that they had put the ſalvation of ſoules into comprimiſe, for the only regard of a shillings gaine: And that the world very much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17508:27"/>
to ſee a complete <hi>Summa,</hi> compoſed vpon the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of great Princes; a matter moſt neceſſary for the quiet of the whole Vniverſe, and altogether omitted by Divines; wherein thoſe actions of Princes should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly diſcourſed vpon, with which ſo often they put the world into confuſion, filling it with robberies, aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, and ſuch flaughters of men, that many of them blinded with the ambition to raigne vpon earth, have made rivers to runne with humane bloud.</p>
            <p>The Colledge of the Learned, hearing theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, ſayd, That they much deſired to have theſe Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons diſputed, and reſolved: Namely, whether Chriſtian pietie will admit the ſpeciall <hi>hipotheſis,</hi> which the violence of the ſword hath vſurped over others States: Whether a Principality, that by Armes, and fraud, is forceably ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from another Prince, may be held by one that hath the true feare of God: Whether that courſe of ruling a Kingdome, which is conquered onely to the end to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverish and waſte it, that ſo it may be governed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out jealouſie, may be practiſed by one that is borne in the Chriſtian Faith: Whether the exalting of <hi>Reaſon of State</hi> to ſuch an height, that it should trample vnder feet, as at this preſent it doth, all Lawes divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, be not a more deteſtable and execrable Idolatry, then worshipping <hi>Nabuchadnezzars</hi> Image, or the golden Calfe. And laſtly, the Colledge ſayd, That then their deſires would be fully accomplished, when there could be found a Divine ſo much fearing God, that with his Writings durſt fright Princes as much from doing evill, as many others with their great Volumes had terrified private men; for it ſeemed a ſtrange thing vnto them, that infinite learned Divines had ſo laboured to reaſon

of the ſtrict accompt, which Shop-keepers are to render, even for idle words, vnto the Majeſtie of God, and in the meane time had omitted to make mention of thoſe exorbitant errors, committed by great Princes; when with their Armies over-running States, they ſend all things into perdition, both ſacred and prophane: And that with more benefite to mankinde, and eternall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to themſelues, Divines might have diſcourſed vpon the actions of <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, and <hi>Frances</hi> the firſt, both Kings of <hi>France;</hi> of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth the Emperor, whoſe ſoules departed out of this world with the heauy burthen of halfe a million of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughters, all comitted by their ambition to raigne, and whereof they were to giue a ſtrict accompt to Almighty God: All which were matters exceeding neceſſary, to the end, that mankind ſo much afflicted by the ambition of Princes, might one day receiue the conſolation, which with ſuch longing it deſireth, when thoſe that raigne, should be terrified from doing amiſſe, and be made to know, that Hell was prepared aſwell for the Great, as the ſmall.</p>

faſhidious, and chargeable purgation, compounded of divers Oyles of Holy Leagues, of inſurrections of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of rebellions of Nobilitie, of Cauteries, and other very bitter ingredients, whereby she had ſpoiled her ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, weakned her ſtrength, and altogether loſt her appetite; and that the infinite quantitie of Syrrupes, and the many medicines which she had taken with ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, had wrought no other effect, but the accelleration of the diſeaſe, which without that vnlucky and vnſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable purgation peradventure she shold neuer haue had: Moreouer, that the many Leaches which were applied to many parts of her body, had in ſuch manner ſucked the beſt vitall bloud of the Gold of that <hi>Spayne,</hi> that thorough the weakneſſe of her complexion, she was not able to euacuate thoſe evill humors of <hi>Flanders,</hi> which had held her, and doe hold her oppreſſed.

            <p>An inſtitution no doubt very noble, and holy; for it hath effected, that in the progreſſe of ſo many ages, ſince firſt it was vſed, Princes haue corrected an infinitie of errors: beſides, knowing that they are to be called to ſo ſtrict an accompt, it maketh them endeuour to liue ſo

vertuouſly, that in the preſence of ſo many Princes they need not to blush. Vpon the day appointed then, moſt of the Potentates of the World appeared before <hi>Apollo:</hi> And Count <hi>Baldazar Castiglione</hi> the <hi>Politicall Cenſor,</hi> ſaid vnto the reuerend Lord <hi>Giouanni dalla Caſa,</hi> Nuntio for the Sea Apoſtolicall in this State, which was firſt drawen out of the Vrne; That it ſeemed vnto him a moſt ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous matter, and indeed vnworthy the Greatneſſe, and Maieſtie of the Popes, that in <hi>Rome</hi> should be ſeene ſome potent Families, vnto whom it ſerved in ſtead of a rich patrimony to be dependant on forraigne Princes, not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well affected to the greatneſſe of the Apoſtolicke Sea, which in euery occaſion were apt with the power of their Factions to giue the Popes much trouble; And that he might truly ſay, how in all his time he had not ſeene a more foule and execrable thing, then that which the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth did, when with the noble Charge of the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> he rewarded the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell ſeditions, and shamefull treacheries, which the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Pompeo Colonna</hi> vſed againſt the High Bishop <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeuenth.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17508:30"/>
that they haue reduced thoſe Poppies, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore were as high as Cedars, to the humble ſtature of ridiculous dwarffes.</p>
            <p>This anſwere ſatisfied the Count, who turning to the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, next diawen out of the Vrne, he ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, That the preſent diſorders, which were ſeene not only in the great patrimony of the Houſe of <hi>Austria,</hi> but in all <hi>Germany,</hi> proceeded from the negligence of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Emperor <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> and therefore he much deſired, that that Maieſtie would with more care embrace the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his ſo many States; remembring, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, rulers of mankinde, bore vpon their shoulders the heauieſt weight, and had in their hands the moſt labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worke, that any the painefulleſt day-labourer what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer could exerciſe.

            <p>Wherefore it was to be conſidered, That the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous felicities, which the moſt mighty Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> haue had by inheriting with their Matches, the States of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Kingdomes of <hi>Spaine,</hi> of <hi>Naples, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia, Bohemia, Hungarie,</hi> and <hi>Portugall,</hi> haue giuen all the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> and of <hi>Europe</hi> ſuch diabolicall jealouſies, that they haue cauſed both the paſſed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ruines, now beheld in their ancient patrimony: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reunto the Emperors, which haue raigned ſince <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> the firſt of famous memory, albeit they were reputed

moſt valorous &amp; prudent princes, could neuer after apply any ſalue, that did not infinitely exaſperate the ſore of the diſorders of <hi>Germany,</hi> wherein had concurred ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of malignant humors, that it might truly be ſaid, it was immedicable. Further, it was to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, what ſmall authoritie, the moderne Emperors haue had in <hi>Germany,</hi> ſo that it were not only a diſcurteſie, but open injuſtice to will one, that hath his hands faſt bound behind him, to performe the acts of <hi>Orlando.</hi> Moreouer, the qualitie of the Empire was to be regarded, which being electiue, they that ſerued, had more authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in it, then they that commanded. Beſides, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent weaknes of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> from whom (with the ſeditions of Religion) the hearts of their ſubiects are ſtollen; a theft ſo important, that they may well abandon thoſe States as loſt, wherein ſuch dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſeed is ſowen. Wherupon the preſent Emperor ſeeing himſelfe depriued of the obedience of his ſubiects, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth euery one to reflect vpon the qualitie of the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins, which the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> hath in <hi>Spayne,</hi> and they shall finde, that the people of <hi>Almaine</hi> borne for their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, to ſecure themſelues from the monſtrous power of ſuch a Family, take impious and wrongfull reuenges euen on thoſe, which shall not be free from the ſervitude of the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> if for the ſinnes of men they euer arriue to that point of commanding ouer the World; from which (by the meere goodnes and mercy of God they are put off as farre, as by their many deuiſes they haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored to come neere it. That alſo it was to be thought vpon, how the firſt that in <hi>Italy,</hi> and abroad, diſinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all kind of irreuerence, and diſreſpect the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of the Empire, were thoſe their Couſins of <hi>Spayne,</hi> as
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17508:31"/>
clearely appeared by the vſurpation of <hi>Finale,</hi> and other Imperiall feudes by them poſſeſſed. All which things, moouing dangerous humors without diſſolving them afterwards, do cauſe the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> to be cruelly ſcourged by moſt powerfull enemies, whilſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with their only menaces ſeeke to put the whole vvorld into ſuſpition and diſtaſte. And for concluſion, he deſired all the ſacred Colledge to conſider, that to the miſerable ſterilitie of children, which is ſeene in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Emperor, is adioyned a lamentable fertilitie of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; one of which incited by the moſt violent ſpurre of ambition, hath not doubted at laſt to goe about to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his owne Houſe, vvhich is ready to fall. All acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents ſo vnhappy, that they vvould make euen <hi>Salomon</hi> himſelfe ſeeme to the World a very foole.</p>
            <p>Theſe replies, which to all the Aſſiſtants ſeemed very vveighty, ſatisfied the <hi>Cenſor,</hi> vvho turning him to the vvarlike <hi>French Monarchy,</hi> ſaid vnto her, How all the <hi>Vertuous</hi> of <hi>Pernaſſus</hi> much deſired of her, that she vvould rule the furious, vnquiet, capricious, and exceeding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous diſpoſitions of her <hi>French,</hi> reducing them to thoſe termes of prudence, adviſedneſſe, and ſtayedneſſe of minde, which are ſeene in the noble <hi>Italian,</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Nations; &amp; how it much blemished her reputation, that the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> which holdeth a firſt place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the moſt principall Monarchies of the World, should be inhabited by men ſo infinitely rash. To this aduert ſement the <hi>French Monarchy</hi> replied, That the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor</hi> not well informed of the intereſts of her Kingdome, had cenſured for defects the chiefeſt vertues, vvhich she loued in her <hi>French.</hi> Folly, lightneſſe, vnaduiſedneſſe, and a precipitous nature were they, which had made her ſo
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17508:32"/>
feared, and formidable a Queene, becauſe her <hi>French</hi> with vnſpeakeable alacritie and forwardneſſe, would vpon the leaſt nodde of hers, expoſe themſelues to thoſe perils, whereunto other Princes could not with the rope, the cudgell, and the cruelleſt kinds of punishment compell their wiſe, aduiſed, and circumſpect ſubiects: And that in the many warres, which she had held with moſt valorous Nations, she had learned to know, how an army framed of ſouldiers, which had litle braine, and much courage, ſo that they are ledde by a valiant, and diſcreet Generall, doth carry away the victorie from thoſe people, who profeſſe more circumſpection, and wiſedome. This anſwere of the Monarchy of <hi>France,</hi> was ſo much the more commended of <hi>Caſtiglione,</hi> by how much, regarding the qualitie of a mighty Kingdome, he knew that the <hi>French</hi> poſſeſſed all thoſe endowments and vertues, vvhich vvere requiſite in a Nation, for to found, amplify, and maintayne a great Empire.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Cenſor</hi> turning to the powerfull Monarchy of <hi>Spayne,</hi> ſayd vnto her, how it vvas evident, nothing gaue greater ſatisfaction to all people in generall, but more particularly to thoſe which were ſubject to ſtrange Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then the humanitie, and affable cariage of ſuch as governed them; whereas she ſending to the governments of <hi>Naples, Milan,</hi> and <hi>Sicilia,</hi> none but her owne <hi>Spanyards,</hi> they with their ordinary <hi>Caſtilian</hi> ſtatelineſſe, and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable <hi>Spanish</hi> pride, without all compariſon farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding that, which the Kings of <hi>Spayne</hi> themſelves either could, or would haue vſed in thoſe States, did ſo exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate even their good and faithfull ſubjects, that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Dominion was growen infinitely odious: And that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both in vveighty, and ſleight affayres he deſired
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17508:32"/>
more quicke expeditions from her, ſeeing that by her too much delay, and perplexitie in the deliberation of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant matters, shee had loſt many fayre occaſions, that had preſented themſelves vnto her, for the enlarging of her Empire. The Monarchy of <hi>Spayne,</hi> very much than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the <hi>Cenſor</hi> for the advertiſements he had given her, and in her excuſe anſwered, how that honorable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which had a young vvife, beyond all expresſion fayre, but of a diſpoſition enclyned to laſciviouſneſſe, should shew himſelfe very diſcreet, if he deſired, that a proper handſome ſervant, whom he kept in his houſe, should bee rather extreamely hated, then any whit affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his wife: and that vnto the delay in the reſolution of her affayres, which she knew to be virious and prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, it lay not in her power to give remedy: for almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God having not without important occaſions created her <hi>Spaniards</hi> wholly, and altogether quite different in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from the <hi>French,</hi> vvhilſt they in the deliberation of buſineſſes were rather precipitous, then executive, she in her beeing ſo ſlow, and irreſolute, obeyed the will of God, vvho would haue it ſo.</p>
            <p>The next drawen out of the Vrne vvas the Monarchy of <hi>Poland;</hi> vnto vvhom Count <hi>Baldaſar</hi> ſayd, How all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> could haue vvished, that the preſent King <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> had vſed towards thoſe ſeditious Nobles, which laſt rebelled againſt him, ſome ſeveritie worthy ſo grievous a fault, onely to the end, that by their example, other Lords might have beene deterred from commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the like. To this the <hi>Polach</hi> Monarchy anſwered, That thoſe chaſtiſements giuen to the Nobility, which in an hereditarie State would be commodious, haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes prooved in her electiue Kingdome prejudiciall:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17508:33"/>
And how that Kingdome, which another receiueth in gift from a Nobility, in whoſe power is the election of the King, cannot without evident perill of falling from his greatneſſe, be governed with that rigour, vvhich in other hereditarie States is neceſſary; for that Senate, which out of an election of love giveth another a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, if it be provoked by the powerfull paſſion of hate, knoweth alſo how to re-aſſume it, in regard well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed Senators are vvont to reſerve vnto themſelves thoſe neceſſary inſtruments, vvhereby vpon every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of evill ſatisfaction, they may recall their vſed libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie: And that the preſent King <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> beeing the firſt of his Houſe, vvhich had raigned in <hi>Poland,</hi> he vvas to direct the ayme of all his thoughts to no other ſcope ſo much, as by an extraordinary indulgence to vvinne the hearts of the Nobilitie of his State, that ſo vvith a gratefull memorie of his clemency, he might perpetuate the ſucceſſion of ſuch a Kingdome in his Bloud. An ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement, moſt neceſſary for <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> his King, by reaſon the <hi>Polachs,</hi> although their King be electiue, do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer defraud the Royall Bloud of the ſucceſſion, if he that raigneth, can tell how to get the generall loue of the Nobilitie. For the <hi>Polonians</hi> being a Nation, that know not how to liue in an abſolute libertie, do ſo abhorre all manner of ſervitude, that that King among them (a matter common to all electiue Princes) shalbe moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatiue, and vigilant in the matters of his State, that leaſt ſeemeth either to ſee or know any thing. Not only the <hi>Cenſor,</hi> but the whole Colledge of the <hi>Vertuous,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the juſtification of the <hi>Polach</hi> Monarchy for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, the Count turning hemſelfe to the vaſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17508:33"/>
               <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, ſaid vnto him, That the crueltie, which he vſed, onely vpon light ſuſpitions, againſt his chiefeſt miniſters, was held by all the world to bee a bloudy courſe; it being a received opinion, that men of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary valour and merit, should not be layd hands on, but for great and prooved offences: And that when the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes did even juſtly take away the lives of their miniſters, the cuſtome of ſeizing vpon their Eſtates to their owne vſe, and thereof vtterly depriving the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, did ſcandalize all good juſtice, becauſe it ſeemed, that with ſuch cruell rigour, the Eſtates, rather then the faults of the delinquents, were hunted after. To this ſo open a correction, the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire anſwered with admirable gravity, That hee was growen to that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe wherein hee was ſeene, by the onely two moſt powerfull meanes of reward without meaſure, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment vvithout end: And that the ſole foundation of he quiet of every State, being placed in the fidelity of the moſt important miniſters, Princes were not to ſeeke any thing with more care, then with immenſe rewards to allure them vnto faithfulneſſe, and vvith infinite pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments to terrifie them from trecheries: That thoſe miniſters vvhich have in their power the Forces, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and Governments of States, not beeing able to er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17508:34"/>
he with a ſuddaine chaſtiſement had preuented the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of moſt foule treaſons: Which reſolution, though he acknowledged to be moſt ſeuere, yet he knew it had ſo wrought, that there vvere neuer ſeene in his State any Counts St <hi>Paul,</hi> Princes of <hi>Orange,</hi> Dukes of <hi>Guiſe, d' Aumale, du Maine, de Mercure,</hi> and other foule monſters of diſloyaltie, vvhich, vvith the shame of thoſe Princes, that vvith halters, poynards, and axes knew not how to preuent ſuch dangerous offences, haue beene ſeene otherwhere: It being a rule in matters of State as common, as ſecure, That that miniſter, which giveth to his Prince the leaſt shadow of ſuſpicion of his faith, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth a capitall paine, becauſe thoſe Captaines which haue the care of Armies in their power, are bound, like the wives of Honorable perſonages, to liue with ſuch puritie of minde, that they be free not only from blame, but from the leaſt ſuſpicion of a blame-worthy thought. That touching the ſeazure of his <hi>Baſshawes</hi> eſtates after their death, he thought he might truly ſay, that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainements, gifts, and wealth, wherewithall other Princes rewarded their miniſters, in compariſon of thoſe inexhauſtible riches which he beſtowed on his well-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing Officers, were vile, and poore, as thoſe Royall Treaſures, which <hi>Ruften, Mahomet, Ibrahin,</hi> and infinite others left behinde them after their deceaſe, haue fully teſtified: That the greateſt regard, which a Prince ought to haue in rewarding his miniſters, conſiſteth in proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that the vnmeaſurable riches, wherewith he bought of them infinite fidelitie, may not poſſibly at any time be conuerted to the prejudice of him, that vſed the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie: That from the grieuous diſorders fallen out in the States of other Potentates he had found it to be a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17508:34"/>
matter moſt pernicious vnto Princes, that the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary riches left by a deſeruing miniſter should paſſe vnto his children, not hauing firſt deſerved it (by their vertue, valour, and fathers ſaid fidelitie) of the Prince: That he had not out of couetouſneſſe, as many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, confiſcated the great inheritances of his <hi>Baſshawes,</hi> but that by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie thereof, thoſe ſubjects should not be idle, &amp; conſequently vicious, which being deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of fathers of notable valour, gaue the Prince aſſured hope they would imitate the vertues of their Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: That the gate of his Treaſure ſtood perpetually open to the heyres of his miniſters, to reſtore them their fathers enheritances twice doubled, when they with their fidelitie, and valour should deſerue them; and how much the riches of men vicious, and ſubject to ambition were apt to diſturbe the peace of any Kingdome how great ſoeuer, well appeared by the fresh examples, which he had ſeene both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire ſpake in this manner, he obſerued that the renowned <hi>French</hi> Monarchy with the shaking of her head, ſeemed to declare, that she no way approued thoſe reaſons, whereupon ſomewhat the more moued, he ſaid thus: Mighty Queene, my cuſtome in ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing vpon the eſtates of my <hi>Baſshawes,</hi> is profitable for the greatneſſe, and quiet of my State; and in regard of the friendship that is betwixt vs, I would to God, the ſame courſe were obſerued in your <hi>France;</hi> for you know full well, to what vſe <hi>Henry</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> conuerted the exceeding riches, wherewithall the liberall Kings <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond rewarded the merits of Duke <hi>Francis</hi> his father.

               </gap>es in ſuch ſort, that no priuate man whatſouer should once hope to taſte of ſo ſweet a thing: And I tell you freely, that if your Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> had in my State but only thought that, which with ſuch publike ſcandall he boldly put in execution in your Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> I wold the very firſt day haue given him that blow, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto your King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, although hee were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited vnto it by the greater part of the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> could neuer be drawen, vntill the very laſt hower of his shamefull diſgraces, and euen at that inſtant, when the ſore of the <hi>French</hi> vprores vvas become an incurable vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; for where ambition raigneth among Nobles, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are conſtrained to shew themſelues all ſeveritie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually keeping ſcaffalds in readineſſe, and prepared, to punish the ſeditious, and rebellious; and their Treaſury open, to reward the quiet, and the loyall; that Prince beeing vnworthy to command, that hath not the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding how to make himſelfe be obeyed; neither can there be a more ſcandalous matter ſeene, or met withall in a State, then that the Prince should liue in jealouſy of an Officer, which ought to tremble before him. But it is the propertie of you the Princes of Chriſtendome, making profeſſion of Learning, and directing your ſelues by rules of Policie, to call me Barbarous, and my ſecure way of proceeding, Tyrannicall, whilſt in the meane time yee ſuffer your ſelues to be reduced by your heroicall

vertues of clemency, and gentleneſſe, to shamefull termes of enduring vnworthy things.</p>
            <p>It is not poſſible to deliver, how much the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire offended all the <hi>Vertuous</hi> of the ſacred Colledge with his diſcourſe, who ſtanding vp, told him in great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, how they could proove vvith preſent reaſons, that all which he had ſaid, were moſt wicked conceipts, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be ſpoken by any perſon that had a ſoule, or to be heard of men, that made profeſſion of honour. Whereunto the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire anſwered ſmiling, That others in the gouernment of Kingdomes might haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to <hi>Vertue,</hi> and I know not what, but for his part he would neuer be perſwaded, but that the quiet and peace of States ought to be preferred before all other humane intereſts whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Cenſor,</hi> to cut off ſo odious a diſpute, turning to the great Dutchy of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> ſaid vnto him, That the moſt noble prerogatiue of raigning ouer people, which vvere louers of Learning, and excellently <hi>Vertuous,</hi> vvas the ſecond amongſt the greatneſſes of a Prince: Whereas hee by ſo endevouring to bring vp his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in a groſſe ignorance, reaped no ſmall blame, if not much diſreputation; becauſe euery one skorned him, for that, expelling the famous liberall Arts out of his State, he had only permitted his people to learne the benefite of vvriting and reading. To this Cenſure the Dutchy of <hi>Moſcovy</hi> answered, That the dreadfull fire, vvhich he had obſerued, Learning had euer kindled in thoſe States, where it had beene admitted, had made him reſolue not to ſuffer in any ſort, that ſo ſcandalous a a Cockle should be ſowed in his Dutchy; for men beeing the heards of Princes, as sheepe the flocks of priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17508:36"/>
it vvere extreame folly to arme thoſe gentle sheepe their ſubjects with the malice, which Learning engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth into their diſpoſitions, that attaine vnto it; whereas otherwiſe, in regard of that harmeleſſe ſimplicitie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Almighty God hath creared them, they may be comodiouſly ruled and gouerned, be they never ſo many in number, by one Prince alone: And how he held for infallible truth, that if the <hi>Germanes,</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> had beene maintained by their Princes in the ſimplicitie of their ancient ignorance, and withall it had beene prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, that the pure minde of thoſe Nations might not haue beene contaminated with the plague of <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> learning, without all doubt they had neuer had the judgement, with ſuch a ruine of their old religion, and deſtruction of many Princes, that before ruled ouer thoſe Prouinces, to know how to frame thoſe perfect formes of Commonweales in their Countries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto neither the vvit of <hi>Solon,</hi> the vviſedome of <hi>Plato,</hi> nor all the Philoſophy of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> could euer arriue.</p>
            <p>This anſwere ſo mooued the <hi>Cenſor,</hi> and all the ſacred Colledge of the Learned, that with threatning lookes they ſaid, how the reaſons alledged by the Great Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>Moſcouy,</hi> were open blaſphemies; and it ſeemed the Learned were ready to make good their vvords with deeds, when the greater part of the mightieſt Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies were ſeene to betake themſelues to their vveapons, for defence of the <hi>Moſcouite;</hi> vvho growing more auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious vpon the forward aſſiſtance of ſo many Potentates, boldly ſaid, If any one would deny, that Learning did not infinitly diſturbe the quiet, and good gouernment of States; and that a Prince might not with more facilitie rule a million of ignorants, then an hundreth learned,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17508:36"/>
that were made to command, and not to obey, he lied in his throate. The <hi>Vertuous</hi> vpon this daring defiance grew extremely incenſed, and ſtoutly replied, That the <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covite</hi> had ſpoken with an inſolence, worthy of an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and how they could alſo proue vnto him, that men without Learning were aſſes and calues with two legges.</p>
            <p>Now were they almoſt ready to goe together by the eares, when the <hi>Cenſor</hi> cryed out, Forbeare, and carry due reſpect to this place, where we are aſſembled to amend diſorders, and not to commit ſcandals; vvhereupon ſuch vvas the reuerence euery one bare to the Maieſtie of the <hi>Cenſor,</hi> that both the Princes, and the Learned, although they were tranſported with anger and diſdaine, became ſuddainly pacified.</p>
            <p>All being quiet, then the <hi>Cenſor</hi> ſaid vnto the famous <hi>Venetian</hi> Libertie, which next was drawen out of the Vrne, That the hardeſt matter to be found in an Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracie, as she well knew, was to reſtraine the young No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, who vvith their licentiousneſſe diſtaſting the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort of Citizens, had many times occaſioned the ruine of moſt famous Commonweales; And that he to his great griefe had heard, how the young Nobilitie of <hi>Venice</hi> vvith their proud demeanour had offended many honorable Citizens of that State; who exceedingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that vvhilſt the inſolency of the Nobilitie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, the chaſtiſements for it decreaſed; And that therefore he remembred her, that it vvas a dangerous point in an Ariſtocracie, when thoſe vvhich vvere to glory for that they were farre from thoſe dangers, vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſuch are ſubiect, as are to obey the humor of a Prince, be heard to complaine, that they are oppreſſed by many Tyrants. Hereunto the <hi>Venetian</hi> Libertie anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17508:37"/>
That the diſorder recounted by the <hi>Cenſor</hi> vvas true, and vvithall dangerous; but that the authoritie of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, vvas ſo annexed to pride and inſolencie, that they ſeemed to be borne both at one birth: And that the licentiouſneſſe, vvhich the Nobilitie of all Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracies vſeth towards the Citizens, vvas by all the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt men, that haue diſcourſed of Commonweales, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted a deſperate cure; for although it vvas moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that inſolencies should be reſtrained vvith ſeuere paines, yet on the other ſide, an Ariſtocracie vvas to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine as much as poſſibly might be from publike pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments of Noble men, albeit ſeditious; to the end that their shamefull ſuffering might not be an occaſion to diſinherit the vvhole Nobilitie it ſelfe of that reſpect vvhich is due to them from the people; for hauing the gouernment of the State in their hands, the intereſt of the publike conſervation thereof requireth, that they be held in higheſt reputation: And although in her <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> diſobedient, and inſolent Noblemen vvere not ſeene to be ſo often punished, betweene the two pillars in the <hi>Piazza</hi> of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Marke,</hi> as it ſeemeth many deſired, yet by the great Councell, the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> the Colledge, and other ſupremer Magiſtrates, that diſpence the publike Charges, thoſe ſeditious Noblemen, vvhich vvere diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to carry a tyrannicall, mind, were cruelly afflicted vvith the torment of shamefull repulſes: And that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſubiects of moſt noble Houſes are ſeene in <hi>Venice,</hi> vvhoſe ancient reputation for their demerits vvas may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Arquebuſes charged vvith bullets of paper; and that beeing ſtrucken downe vvith ſuch kinde of shot, they could neuer riſe ſince to honors and dignities; things vvherein conſiſteth the life of the Noblemen of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17508:37"/>
an Ariſtocracie: And that to excruciate a body, a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter torture could not be deviſed, no not by <hi>Perillus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, then that vvhich once a Nobleman of <hi>Venice</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, vvhen in a concurrence of the Honorableſt Charges, he ſaw one younger then himſelfe paſſe before him, only becauſe he vvas knowen to the Senate to be more deſeruing. <hi>Caſtiglione</hi> did not only admit the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Venctian</hi> Libertie, but alſo did infinitely commend the circumſpection, and ſeveritie, which she vſed in punishing her Nobilitie vpon occaſion of any demerit, or defect.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Cenſor</hi> ſaid vnto the Dutchy of <hi>Savoy,</hi> That his State beeing ſeated in the Confines of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> he vvas neceſſited with all carefulneſſe to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine himſelfe neutrall betweene thoſe Princes, vvith whom he confined; but in thoſe laſt rumors of <hi>France,</hi> by diſcovering himſelfe openly to be wholly <hi>Spanish,</hi> he had put, not only his owne, but the States of all the Princes of <hi>Italie</hi> in great trouble: And that whilſt vvith the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes of his forces he blew the fire of the <hi>French</hi> vprores, kindled by the <hi>Spanyards</hi> ambition, he ought to beleeve, that that flame vvas to burne vp friends and kin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

the Seas, were growen to an exceſſive rate. To this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection the great Dutchy of <hi>Toſcan</hi> anſwered, That the power of a Prince could not be termed perfect, which with a number of armed Veſſels had not ſome Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the Sea: And that his Gallies vvere not only very neceſſary for the <hi>Toſcan</hi> greatneſſe, but alſo for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Libertie of all <hi>Italy,</hi> as ſcruing for a Schoole of Mariners, for a Seminary of Captaines, and ſouldiers at Sea: That he confeſſed the dammage, which they did to the trade of merchandiſe, but vvithall, he deſired it might be conſidered, that the myſterie of Warre, either by Land, or Sea, could not be learned by ſouldiers, nor exerciſed by Princes without prejudice to others: And that <hi>Toſcan</hi> breeding much filthineſſe of fantaſticall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet braines, and extravagant humors, he had therefore great occaſion for thoſe Gallies, that might ſerve, as it were, to carry forth all the filth of his State, and thereby keepe it cleane, employing ſuch only for gally-ſlaues in them, as had done euill before, and that in regard of their vnquiet nature, vvere like to doe worſe after.</p>
            <p>This excuſe of the Great Dutchy of <hi>Toſcan</hi> vvas ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved both by the <hi>Cenſor,</hi> and all the ſacred Colledge. Whereupon the Count ſaid vnto the Libertie of <hi>Genoua,</hi> vvho was laſt drawen out of the Vrne, That the exceſſiue vſe of exchanges, which she permitted vnto her Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, cauſed that great diſorder of enriching the priuate, and vvithall of empouerishing the publike, vvhoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vennues vvould haue riſen to huge ſummes of Gold, if the reall riches of her Nobilitie had beene employed in a juſt trade of merchandiſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Genoueſe</hi> Libertie with a readineſſe, that gaue a particular guſt to all the Learned, anſwered, How it was
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17508:39"/>
true, that exchanges doe vvorke that effect, vvhich the <hi>Cenſor</hi> had mentioned, and therefore vvere moſt pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in any Monarchy vvhatſoeuer; howbeit that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they might be permitted in a well-ordered Commonwealth vvithout any prejudice of the publike intereſts; becauſe the richeſt, and ſecureſt Treaſures of a free State, are the riches of the Nobilitie, and Citizens together; a matter, which falleth not out in a Monarchy, where betweene the commings in of the Prince, and the meanes of private men, there runneth a long wall of eight ſtories high built by <hi>Mine,</hi> and <hi>Thine:</hi> Further, that in a Monarchy the mutation of the State commonly followeth vvith litle, or no prejudice to the people, only changing the name of <hi>Mathew,</hi> to that of <hi>Martin;</hi> but in the ſubverſions of Commonweales, where libertie is changed into ſervitude, there the proper ſubſtance of private men is the publike treaſure; for then will they profuſely ſpend all that ever they haue, for to defend their owne liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie euen to the laſt gaſpe.</p>

               <hi>DOn Hernando de Toledo</hi> Duke <hi>d'Alva,</hi> a few dayes ſince, arrived at <hi>Pernaſſus,</hi> and by expreſſe order from <hi>Apollo,</hi> a diligent examination of his actions beeing made by the militarie men, he was found wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be admitted into <hi>Pernaſſus</hi> amongſt thoſe famous Captaines, which without effuſion of bloud, knew how to vanquish an enemy, more by patience, and art, then by open force; or valour; that durſt hazard the fortune of Kingdomes vpon the doubtfull chance of a Battaile. But becauſe <hi>Lodovico Guicciardino,</hi> an vnderſtanding Writer of the affaires of <hi>Flanders;</hi> had preferred a Complaint, how that for certaine matters not very pleaſing, vvhich he had written of the Duke, he had beene ill entreated by him, therefore he ſtayed a long time to cleare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of ſuch an imputation; for there was an Edict of <hi>Apollo</hi> very rigorouſly obſerved in <hi>Pernaſſus,</hi> whereby that Prince, or private man, was declared to be infamous, which durſt offer any wrong to any Hiſtorian, or other Writer, for things written by him not very honorable, but yet true: Howbeit, of ſuch power were the Dukes friends that <hi>Guicciardino</hi> was contented to revoke his complaint,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17508:44"/>
whereupon withall the greateſt ſolemnitie he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into <hi>Pernaſſus,</hi> and had a place in his Majeſties Company of men at Armes, which was commanded by that famous <hi>Quintus Fabius Maximus;</hi> who for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of his well-aduiſed warineſſe, was ſurnamed <hi>Cunctator.</hi> And it happened, that amongſt the other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Captaines, which the ſaid Duke viſited, one was the moſt excellent Lord <hi>Proſpero Colonna,</hi> by whom he was receiued with all kind of honour; and ſo much the more, becauſe he vnderſtood that the Duke made a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like profeſſion of beeing the diſciple, follower, and imitator of his ſlow, but ſure way of making warre. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, a ſtrange and troubleſome accident fell out in this viſitation; for at the firſt meeting, the Duke having given the Lord <hi>Proſpero</hi> the Title of <hi>your Honour,</hi> he was ſo incenſed with diſdaine, that taking himſelfe to be highly wronged by ſo vile a title, with an angry voyce he ſaid; Duke, I had thought thou wert come hither, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor one that is greater then thy ſelfe, not to vndervalew him; but becauſe it is the fashion of the <hi>Coloneſi</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the injuries of words with deedes, goe out of this houſe, and in the ſtreet (with my ſword in mine hand) I will prooue vnto thee, that all thoſe, vvhich vſe ſuch baſe termes to men of my ranke, deſerve not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Company of honourable perſons. The Duke remained much aſtonished to ſee that great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine take the matter ſo hainouſly at his hands; and going to withſtand the Lord <hi>Proſpero,</hi> who offered to thruſt him out of the chamber, they fell to grapple one with another: And becauſe the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> which were in company with the Duke, ſeeing him in ſuch termes
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17508:44"/>
with <hi>Colonna,</hi> entred into the chamber to aſſiſt him: the <hi>Italians</hi> which belonged vnto the Lord <hi>Proſpero</hi> did the like; whereupon in regard of the number of perſons in ſo ſtreit a place, there enſued a cruell frey; the noyſe whereof comming into the ſtreet, was the cauſe that the newes of ſo dangerous an accident was ſuddainly carried to <hi>Apollo;</hi> who in all haſt diſpatched thither the Regent of the <hi>Vicaria</hi> vvith the guard of Archers, who freed the Duke out of the Lord <hi>Proſperoes</hi> hands: and the vprore beeing quieted, hee commanded the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> that had beene very ill handled, to returne home to their houſes; Thereupon the Lord <hi>Proſpero,</hi> to prevent any ſiniſter information that might haue beene given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, preſented himſelfe before <hi>Apollo,</hi> vnto whom (the fame goeth) with a troubled countenance he vſed theſe vvords: Sir, it is well knowen, that men of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Colonna,</hi> of the qualitie I am of, haue alwaies enjoyed the title of Excellencie, <hi>antequam Abraham fieret,</hi> and ere the <hi>Spanyards</hi> were <hi>in rerum natura;</hi> Wherefore for that Nation to abuſe a man of my ranke, as the Duke <hi>d' Alva</hi> did me but now, is moſt inſupportable; for if the vileneſſe of him that offendeth, doth infinitely aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the injurie vvith him that is offended, how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that an <hi>Italian</hi> Baron of my qualitie, should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine himſelfe within the bounds of modeſtie, ſeeing himſelfe vndervalewed by that Nation, whoſe miſeries, not aboue foure dayes agoe to ſpeake of, ſo mooved the whole World to compaſſion, that throughout all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches they were recommended to the charitie of well-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Chriſtians, of whom almes were gathered, to free them from the miſerable ſervitude, wherein they were
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17508:45"/>
ſo grievouſly oppreſſed by the of <hi>Moores</hi> of <hi>Granada.</hi> The <hi>Spanyards</hi> enjoy the dominion of the greater part of <hi>Italy;</hi> where, by ſuch as I am, notwithſtanding that daily they threaten it vvith a cruell, and vniverſall ſervitude, they are loved, honoured, and even ſerved. With their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious avarice they haue deprived vs of out wealth; and in that lamentable ſacke of <hi>Rome</hi> vvith their vnexpreſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble luſt they violated the honour of our chaſteſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons. And now, in exchange of ſo abject a patience, they would alſo take from vs this litle honour of breath wee enjoy, and theſe miſerable Titles, the vnhappy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, and deplorable reliques of the <hi>Italian</hi> reputation: Which is a matter ſo hard to be digeſted, that by every honourable <hi>Italian</hi> Baron it ought to be revenged, not vvith complayning words, as I doe, but vvith daggers points.</p>
            <p>It is reported by them that vvere then preſent, how all the while the Lord <hi>Proſpero</hi> was ſpeaking, <hi>Apollo</hi> did nothing but ſmile, and that when vpon his concluſion he burſt out into thoſe words, how the <hi>Spanyards</hi> abuſes towards the <hi>Italians</hi> vvere to be revenged with daggers points, he fel to laughing out-right, and ſaid, <hi>Proſpero,</hi> thou art, and ever wert too much given over to choller: and I am inforced to tel thee, how it infinitly miſlikes me, that ſuch a one as thou, who haſt alwaies made a particular profeſſion of prudence, shouldeſt marvaile, that ſlaves, which for twentie yeares together have beene fedde in the Gallyes vvith courſe, and mouldy Bisket, when they light vpon a batch of new white Manchet, should fill their bellies till they are ready to cracke againe: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that raging appetite of theirs, and every other disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt

act, vvhich they vſe, to aſſwage their hunger, ought to be ſo farre from ſeeming odious vnto honeſt men which behold it, that it should rather moove them to pittie. Therefore do yee <hi>Italians</hi> likewiſe permit, that the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> men but new in this World, and lately got out of the ſervitude of the <hi>Moores</hi> of <hi>Granada,</hi> may glut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with meate ſo delicate to their taſte, as are the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Titles, vvhich they haue found in <hi>Italy:</hi> for I aſſure thee, that vvhen they shalbe cloyed vvith ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities they alſo vvill become, as the <hi>French</hi> are, ſuch cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Gallants, that they vvill vvillingly giue the Title of <hi>Excellency</hi> even to their horſe-boyes, much more to ſuch as thou art. And I tell thee, that if thou hadſt that prudence, and that perfect knowledge of the World, as I vvish thou haddeſt, thou vvouldeſt very well perceive, that thoſe exorbitances, and that ſo odious manner of proceeding, which the <hi>Spanyards</hi> vſe in <hi>Italy,</hi> whereof thou ſo complayneſt, is even as ſo much ſweet ſuger for you <hi>Italians,</hi> and bitter poyſon for the <hi>Spanyards;</hi> who if to their valour, to their adviſedneſſe, and vnſpeakeable ambition vvhich they haue to raigne, they had affable and curteous manners annexed, vvith the vtter deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that remnant of Libertie, which is yet out of the Lyons jawes, they would ſoon become abſolute Maſters of the World. All which are inſolencies, that vvith dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers points, not by you <hi>Italians,</hi> but by the Monarchy of <hi>Spayne</hi> herſelfe, ought to be revenged vvith all kinde of crueltie on her <hi>Spanish</hi> Miniſters, who with their vanitie diſtaſte the good ſervants of ſo great a Queene, and make her government nothing acceptable to her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: A diſorder that bringing much difficultie to the ſubſtance of that Vniverſal Monarchy, wherunto it is not
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17508:46"/>
poſſible she can arrive vvith the publike hatred of all <hi>Italy,</hi> hath high need of remedie.</p>
            <p>With this anſwere <hi>Apollo</hi> returned the Lord <hi>Proſpero</hi> exceeding well ſatisfied to his houſe, after whom the Duke <hi>d'Alva</hi> appeared before his Majeſty with all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily wonderfull melancholy, vvhich caſt ſuch milke in their faces, that the <hi>Spanyards</hi> ſeemed not ſo blacke, as ordinarily thoſe <hi>Moores</hi> that come out of <hi>Granada</hi> vſe to be. Then <hi>Apollo</hi> interrupting the complaint vvhich the Duke was about to make againſt the Lord <hi>Colonna,</hi> ſaid; Duke, I am much diſpleaſed vvith the diſorder, vvhich I vnderſtand hath happened, and ſo much the more, by how much the cauſe of ſuch an vprore is not very juſt, nor vvithall very honourable on thy ſide: And vpon this occaſion it pleaſeth me to remember vnto you <hi>Spanyards,</hi> that to be not only niggards, as to all men ye are knowen, but not to vſe prodigalitie in giving vnto others thoſe Titles, vvhich are deſired, is a manifeſt ſigne of malignitie, becauſe the ingenuous nobilitie of a Baron is knowen, by shewing litle covetouſneſſe in receiving Titles, and much liberalitie in giving them: For even by over much, not by due honour, doth greater reputation accrew to him that giveth, then to him that receiveth it. And you <hi>Spanyards,</hi> that vſe ſuch auſteritie in deſiring great Titles onely for your ſelves, are not avvhit encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in reputation, but rather are become ſo odious, and ridiculous to all men, that the <hi>Italians</hi> in their Comedies, haue deſervedly introduced the perſonage of the <hi>Spanyard</hi> to repreſent vnto the World a perfect <hi>Braggadochia.</hi> I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yee should not preceive, that in thinking to arrive vnto the Dominion of the earth by abuſing men, is the vvrong way to the wood; The mindes of men (Duke)

are taken vvith the baite of humanitie, vvith the whiſtle of gratitude, of courteſie, of gentleneſſe; and that Fowler would shew himſelfe very ignorant, that should goe with a drumme into a Dove-houſe for to take Pigeons, as I ſee you <hi>Spanyards,</hi> foolishly doe. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I tell you, that if ever any Nation vvere to make a baite of dignities, for to allure the <hi>Italians</hi> to fall into the nets of your Dominions, and light vpon the Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush of your ſervitude, it is you <hi>Spanyards,</hi> for the ends vvhich yee haue vpon <hi>Italy:</hi> Withall yee are to conſider, that the States, vvhich yee poſſeſſe, of <hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi> are faſtned vnto you with Waxe; for yee shall command over thoſe two members no longer, then till the <hi>Italians</hi> reſolve to chaſe you from thence; who if they could be aſſured, that after your ruine, they should not fall into the power of the <hi>French,</hi> ye should quickly know, that only vvith a litle diſturbance, which they could give you in the Port of <hi>Genoua,</hi> they would put you into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand intricate difficulties: all matters, that should admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish you to give ſatiſfaction, at leaſtwiſe in vvords, to them, whom in regard of your Intereſts in <hi>Italy,</hi> yee are obliged to reſpect. As for the injurie, vvhich you ſay you have received from the Lord <hi>Proſpero,</hi> I tell you plainly, that whatſoever affront shalbe done you vpon any ſuch like Titular occaſion, I vvill not onely be inſenſible of it, but I vvill thinke you haue deſirouſly ſought it. Then the Duke would have excuſed himſelfe vvith ſaying, that from his King he had inſtruction how to carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe towards the <hi>Italian</hi> Barons in the particular of Titles, vvhen <hi>Apollo</hi> told him, that the <hi>Spanish</hi> abuſes to the <hi>Italians</hi> were not to extend but only to the <hi>Neapoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> and <hi>Milaneſi;</hi> and his Majeſtie alſo added, That if
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17508:47"/>
much paſſion did not blind the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> they might eaſily ſee, how their <hi>Grandes,</hi> whom <hi>Spayne</hi> it ſelfe could not containe, and that in <hi>Italy,</hi> would play the Gyants, compared with the <hi>Romane</hi> Barons; and thoſe of meane ſtature would prove but dwarſſes. Herevpon a cloude, as white as ſnow, beginning by litle and litle to cover the perſon of <hi>Apollo,</hi> the Prieſts that were about him percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved how his Maieſtie would prophecie; ſo that every one falling proſtrate on the ground, and vvith the reſt, the Duke and his followers; out of that hollow cloud proceeded the divine voyce of his Majeſtie, which with a pleaſing ſound ſpake in this ſort: I fortell vnto you, <hi>Spanyards,</hi> that vvith your rough and odious manner of proceeding, yee vvill one day compell the <hi>Italian</hi> Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; which is the Miſtres of the cruell <hi>Sicilian Veſpres,</hi> to plot ſome bloudy <hi>Neapolitan Even-ſong</hi> againſt you; it beeing the proper cuſtome of the <hi>Italians,</hi> with greater rage to revenge the abuſes of words, then the offences of blowes; as they that having short patience, and long hands, are borne not only with an heart moſt inclined to great reſolutions, but that doe not vſe to revenge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries with all kind of crueltie, before they are quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by thoſe that did them. And with your owne ruine, you vvill then finde them, with ſwords in their hands, to be <hi>Paladine Orlandoes,</hi> when ye shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your ſelves, they are become moſt ſuffering Aſſes.</p>

            <head>The Poſte of Pernaſſus <hi>to the Reader.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THeſe Papers comming by chance into my hands, I perceived there was ſomething in them that I could not perceive; wherefore I thought beſt to communicate them with better vnderſtandings: for my part I could ſee no hurt in them, but did imagine by that little good vvhich I ſaw, there was much more that I could not ſee, and therefore judged them fit for all mens eyes. Yet finding the names of <hi>Spayne</hi> and <hi>Auſtria,</hi> or <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Spayne,</hi> (pardon me, politicke Reader, for I am not certaine vvhich should have priority; and I know in ſuch Catholike points, a little error is deadly) ſo often inſerted, I durſt not be too bold with ſacred things. For I well ſaw thoſe two names joyntly conſidered, are now growne of ſuch eſtimation, as all Nations and Kings bend their knees, and doffe their Bonnets at the naming of them; more ſuperſtitiouſly for deſtroying, then reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently at the Name of Ieſus for ſaving. Therefore I could not reſolve, vvhether it were treaſon or ſacriledge, or I wot not what greater ſinne, to touch ſacred things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely with common and vnwasht hands; eſpecially when I ſaw all ſuch as had done the like, or leſſe then thus, made miſerable examples of diſobedience, as if they had offended <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe, or a houſe miraculouſly rayſed vp by God, or rather originally created in nature, to rule over all the vvorld in <hi>Adams</hi> ſtead; and that to be
<pb facs="tcp:17508:48"/>
the ſonne of a King, could not protect an offendor in this kind from punishment, yea, from being caſt out of his Paradiſe. O (thought I) vvhen I ſaw this, how wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy is he, that doth thus to be counted onely the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique King: for he is a King of kings indeed, fit to be the executioner of his Holineſſe divine Decrees, and to conſume all vvith Lightning, vvhere the ſacred fulmina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vvent before. Tremble all Princes, and looke to your Crownes; eſpecially you perty ones in <hi>Germany,</hi> that are but fatted to be ſwallowed one after another, as his ſtomacke can digeſt, or your turne comes to bee ſerved vp. You ſee it is ſafer beeing his ſervant, then the ſonne of any Potentate beſides. Therefore ſtrive for place and preferment there, and helpe vvith all the ſpeed yee may, to betray one another to ruine. You that are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants or <hi>Lutherans,</hi> it is no matter for Religion; hold ſome the ſtirrop, and let others lift <hi>Spayne</hi> into the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, to ride one another like Poſte-horſes by turnes. You ſee how honourably hee deales with that Prince, whoſe peaceable patents made him eaſie entrance; and how fauourably vvith the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> vvhom hee rides in bloud, and ſpur-galls on both ſides, vvhilſt you ſtand laughing on, and ſee not that your day is comming.</p>
            <p>Thus I thought, and thought withall to be ſilent, and to keepe theſe Papers from flying abroad, for feare of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my owne vvings clipt. But vvhen I ſaw in defect of greater, God had rayſed vp petty Princes to defend the Faith, and put that ſpirit into the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Count <hi>Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:17508:48"/>
all the glory to himſelfe, that hee employes ſuch inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, vvhoſe eſtates, in compariſon, are but drops to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ocean: I vvill not therefore be guilty of ſo much cowardize, as to reſerve my ſelfe, vvhere theſe men fight, and ſeeme prodigall of their owne lives; or at leaſt, not of ſo much dishoneſty, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale what God hath ſent into my hands, perhaps to publish for the generall information and benefit of all Chriſtendome. Goe out therefore, and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in Gods Name.</p>
