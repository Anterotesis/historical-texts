         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is as customary now a dayes
to have a Preface or Epistle
to a Book as a Title, and
least I should seem singular,
or make my self a mark for
squintey'd Critticks; I do
tell the Reader, an Epistle
to him is the same property
that a Link is to a Man walking home late: He
hopes by that and the help of good words, if he
<pb facs="tcp:103355:3"/>
be examined, to pass without danger; yet when
he comes to the Gates, if he meet with a Proter
that<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s an Ass, or with a Constable that loves to
lay about him with his Staff of Authority more
then he needs, then let the Party that stumbles
into these pudles of Ignorance, be sure either to
be struck down with Barbarism (which cutteth
worse than a Brown-bill) or to be committed and
have the severest censure laid upon him, let him
be never so well and so civilly bound up in fair
behaviour; though he be a man even printed in
the best Complements of Curtesie, though he
give never so many sweet Languages, yea, and
have all the light of understanding to lead him
home; yet these Spirits of the Night will hale
him away, and cast him into darkness. In the
self same scurvy manner does the world handle
poor Books: When a Reader is intreated to be
Curteous, he grows uncivil; if you sue to his
Worship, and give him the stile of <hi>Candido Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctori,</hi>
then he's proud and cryes mew; If you
write me rily, he calls you Bouffon; seriously,
he swears such stuff can't be yours: But the best
is, that as in <hi>Spain,</hi> you shall have Fellows for a
<pb facs="tcp:103355:3"/>
small piece of Silver take the Strapadoe, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
which torture another man could not be hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with a great Sum; so they that have once or
twice layn upon the rack of publick Censure, of
all other Deaths do least fear that of the Press; of
that wing I hold my self one, Envy has oft hit
me, but can't hurt me; barking Curs seldom
bite. The design of this was for the recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Youth, especially School-boys, whose
wits are generally sharpned on such Whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones;
for number abundant more might have
been added, but since there are many things of
this nature, I have omitted for the major part
those I knew were in Print before; of such you
may be furnished out of <hi>English Parnassus,
Hocus Pocus Iunior,</hi> &amp;c. As these take, I shall
furnish you with more and new varieties.</p>

notch you list, and your thumb shall alwayes rest at
the seventh leaf; namely at the high inch of Paper, from
which your Book is strained, it will fall or slip to the
next; which when you hold fast and open the Book, the
Beholders seeing each leaf to have one colour or picture,
in such varieties all passing continually and directly through
the whole Book, will suppose that with words you can
discolour the leaves at your pleasure.</p>

               <head>The Egg-Box</head>
               <p>IS lookt upon to be as good a Trick, and as cunning a
slight as any that is done, by those that know not the
manner of doing of it: But because it cannot be so well
express'd in words, I have put these Figures under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath

A. the Egg-box, made in the fashion of two Bee-hives,
put one upon the other. B. the upper-shell. C. the
inner-shell, covered over artificially with the shell of an
Egg. D. the lower part of the Box. Putting B, which
is the outward shell, upon C. and both upon D. as it
stands, makes the Box perfect. To do this Trick call
for an Egg; then bid all the Standers by look on it, and
see that it is a real Egg, setting your Box on the Table,
upon the foot D, take off the upper-part B, C. with
your fore-finger and thumb then placing the Egg in the
Box; say, You see here it is fairly in: And uncovering
it again, say, Likewise you shall see me here take it
fairly out; putting it into your Pocket in their sight: Open
your Box again, saying, You see here is nothing; close
your hand about the middle of the Box, and take off B,
by the bottom, you say, There is the Egg again; which
do so appear to the Spectators to be: Clapping that in
again, and taking the lip of C, in your fore-finger and
thumb, say, There 'tis gone again. I saw one shew
this, and the Globes, and the Melting-box so well,
that the ignorance of the People cried out, he was a
Witch; and had not he prostituted his Implements to
their view, that so they might discover his slight, he
had been thrown out of a Window two Stories high.</p>

Plush or Leather, with a Button upon the top, and wide
enough to slip on and off. Have in the bottom of the
Box F, a small quantity of kill'd Quicksilver, which
may be done with the shavings of Pewter, or fasting spittle;
In the second part, which is H, let there be six single
Pens, put this into the first or out-most part, then put G,
into H, and the Box is perfect.</p>
               <p>When you go to shew this Trick, desire any in the
Company to lend you six Pens, and you will return it safe
again: But requesting withal that none will meddle
with any thing they see, unless you desire them, least
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103355:15"/>
they prejudice you and themselves; then take the Cap
off the Box, and bid any one see it, and feel it, that there
may be no mistrust; so likewise take the Box entire,
holding your fore-finger at the bottom, and your thumb
on the upper-part, turning it upside down, say, You see
here is nothing; then putting in the Six-pence, put the
Cap over the Box again, as the Box stands covered upon
the Table, put your hand under the Table, using some
Canting words; then take off the Cap with your fore-finger
and thumb, so as you pinch the inner-most Boxes
with it, and set it gently upon the Table, then put the
kill'd Quicksilver out of the lower part into your hand,
turning the Box with the bottom upward, and stirring
it about with your finger, say, Here you see it melted,
now I will put it in again, and turn it into six single Pence;
suddenly take the Cap as you took it off, returning it
again, bid them blow on it, then take off the Cap as
you did before, only pinch the upper-most lip in it, and
setting it upon the Table, hold the Box at top and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
with your fore-finger and thumb; then put the six
single Pencel, after they are view'd and seen to be so,
in again, and return the Cap as before; saying, Blow
once more, if you intend to have your Six-pence in the
same forme you gave it me; then taking the Cap off by
the button, holding the Box as before, put out the Six-pence,
and return the Box into your Pocket. This is a
very good slight, if well performed, which is done by
often use.</p>

never saw any one of these Fire-eators that had a good
complexion: The reasons I could give, but 'tis known

the Sons of Art already; and the others deserve none.
Some have put bole Armoniack into this Receipt, a cold
thing and spoils the whole, and have omitted <hi>Hematitis</hi>
and <hi>Storax,</hi> not understanding that is it the major heat
that over-powers the minor; but they had as good a

use it.</p>

               <p>ANoint your tongue with liquid <hi>Storax,</hi> and you may
put a pair of Tongs into the fire, make them red hot,
and with the help of this Oyntment you may lick them,

your mouth with this, you may take Wood-coals
out of the fire, dip them into Sulpher powdered, and
the fire seems more strange; but the Sulpher puts out the
Coal, and shutting your mouth close puts out the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher;
and so they commonly champ the Coals and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them, which that they may do without offending the
Body; but if they were bound to eat nothing else, it
would be a very sick Trade.</p>

the Room will seem to them that are in it to be all on
fire; nay themselves will flap their hair and Cloaths,
thinking they are all on fire, when there is no Body hurt,

when any Women with Child are in the Room, for you
your self that shew it (but that you knew to the contrary

               <head>A sheet of Paper called Trouble-wit.</head>
               <p>TRouble-wit has not its name for nought, and indeed is
a very fine invention, by folding a sheet of Paper, as
that by Art you may change it into twenty-six several forms
or fashions: Take a sheet of fine Paper, fold it down the
middle of the sheet long-wayes, when you have so done,
turn down the edge of each fold outwards the breadth of
a single Penny; then measure it, as it is so folded, into
three equal parts with Compasses, which makes six Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in the sheet, let each third part be turned outward,
and the other in course will fall right, then pinch it a
quarter of an inch deep, in the manner as you pinch a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Lanthorn, that is in pleats like a ruff: So that when
the Paper lyes pinched in its form, it is in the fashion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by the Figure A: When closed together like
the Figure B; unclose it again and shuffle it with each
hand it resembles the shuffling a pack of Cards: Close it
and take each corner inward with your fore-finger and
thumb, it resembles a Rose for a Ladies shoo, as is seen
in the Figure C. Stretch it forth from the same form,
and it resembles a cover for an Italian Coach, as is shewn
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103355:23"/>
                  <figure/>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:103355:24"/>
by the letter D. Let go your Fore-finger and thumb at
the lower end, and it resembles a Wicket to a Gate, or
Parral to a Noble Man's Dore, as is shewn by the Letter E.
Close it again, and pinch it at the bottom, spreading it
on the top, and it is in the fashion of a skreen Fan, as it is
shewn by F. Pinch it half way, and open the top, and
it is in the fashion of a Shoomakers cutting Knife, which
is shewn by G. Holding of it in that form, and with
the thumb of your left hand turn out the next sold,
and it is in the form of a curry Comb, as is shewn by
the Letter H. For the rest of the Figures I would have
had cut, but I am tied to six sheets at present, which
will not contain them: But the Ingenious may learn it,
by seeing this Trick once or twice done (since they have
the manner of folding the Paper, which is a great help
to do it.) The next fashion is a Butrice, such as Farriers
use to pare their Horses heels withal. In the fashion of a
Lawyers Desk. In the fashion of a Bridge made of wood,
to carry Foot or Horse speedily over a River. In the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
of a Carriadge for a piece of Ordinance. In the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
of a dark Lanthorn. In the fashion of a Bow-pot.
In the fashion of a Lanthorn with a rose at each end. In
the fashion of a Court Custard. In the fashion of a Mince
Pye, without any Meat in it. In the fashion of a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's
Cap. In the fashion of a Coster-mongers Cap. In
the fashion of a Case for a Looking-glass. In the fashion
of a Sugar-dish; and many more knacks to be plaid with
it, which for brevity I omit.</p>
