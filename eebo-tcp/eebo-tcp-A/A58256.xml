            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS Humbly Offer'd for Placing his Highneſs The Prince of Orange Singly on the THRONE, during Life.</head>
            <p n="1">I. IT will be a clear Aſſertion of the peoples Right, Firm Evidence of a Contract bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and a ſure preſident of all Ages, when after a moſt Solemn Debate, the Eftates of <hi>England</hi> Declare, That the King having <hi>Abdicated</hi> the Government, and the <hi>Throne</hi> thereby Legally Vacant, They think fit to Fill it again with One, who is not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate in the Line.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It will be a Caution to Succeding Kings of what Fatal Conſequence a general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation from the Laws may be, when they find, by this Inſtance, the Exerciſe of the Kingly Office in danger, not only with the Reference to Themſelves, but precarious to their Family by the Miſ-goverment. And Generations to come ſhall praiſe our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, when Reading the Hiſtory of this day, it appears we underſtood our Caſe: Had Honor and Honeſty to maintain it, and Wiſdom enough to Tranſmit it perfect to our poſterity.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It will be the higheſt Obligation upon the Two <hi>Princeſſes</hi> that can be expected from ſenſible people; when, next to aſſerting our own Right, by a Fact (which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, and above other humane Arguments) They ſee themſelves of Ineſtim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Value with Us, by Recontinuing the Line in Remainder; And that their own ſtrict Adherence to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and <hi>Intereſt,</hi> out-weighs the Demerits of their Unhappy Father.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The princeſs of Orange will ſhare in all the Glory of a Crown, without the trouble of it: Eaſy from popiſh Reflection, That She ſits in her Fathers Throne while he lives. And it concerns the Kingdom, as well as the Princes, to take Care, That ſhe be at Reſt from thoſe Solicitations on the behalf of Papiſts, which under the Countenance of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will perpetually Aſſault her Tender Breaſts: Nor is there any room for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Denmark to think Her ſelf neglected, the Exchange being attended with many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, ſuch as it would be loſt Time to Repeat, they are ſo very Obvious, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe too many for the Compaſs of this paper.</p>
            <p n="5">V. If the Prince of Orange be not King in his own Right, His Intereſt cannot be intirely Ours; For tho his Gallantry be an Aſſurance of Sincerity to Us; yet, if there remain any probability of His returning into Holland, as upon the Death of His Wife, if she on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be Soveraign, His Intereſt muſt be divided; Nor will it, according to the Art of Government, become the prudence of any Nation to open the Secrets of their policy to One, whom they may be ſo Unfortunate, as to part with into a Country that may poſſible Interfere with Us.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. It is dangerous to the Governmeet it ſelf, to veſt the Exerciſe of the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Both; For they may differ in Sentiments of things, and if there be a poſſibility of Diviſion, it would be an unaccountable Weakneſs, and great Overſight, not to ſecure our ſelves, in ſo important a point.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. It is Repugnant to grant the Crown to Both, and fix the adminiſtration in one; for the Adminiſtration is an Incident inſeparable from the Soveraignty. To be a King or Queen, and not to have the Exerciſe of King or Queen, is a Contradiction: a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from all the Rules that were ever laid down in Government, unleſs in caſe of Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Incapacity, and therefore below a Maſculine way of Reaſoning.</p>
            <p>Laſtly. It ſupports the noble Maxim. That a neighbouring Nation may take Arms to aſſiſt the Reſcue of a people oppreſſed by Tyranny. And Foreign princes will be apt to look into themſelves, when they hear, by our Example of Gratitute, That they are no longer Safe than Juſt to their Subjects.</p>
