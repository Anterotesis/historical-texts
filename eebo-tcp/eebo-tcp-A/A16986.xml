            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Amongſt all theſe families, yee vvould have me coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one that forgetteth God. Yee deale too proudly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. Knovv then that God hath dealt more ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vvith me, then ever vvith vvicked men for vvickednes. Knovv then that the Puiſſant hath overthrovvne me: and compaſſed his net about me: As never to any man for vvickednes. If I complaine, I cannot be heard: The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rule is: call vpon me in the day of trouble, and I vvill heare thee. But I call, as one that God ſhould heare: but no ſentence is geven. Therefore my caſe is ſtrange: &amp; not as of one puniſhed for vvickednes. He hath hedged me in on every ſide, that I cannot paſſe: He hath not done ſo vvith vvicked Nemrod: nor vvith any vvicked. He hath beſtript me of all my honour: vvhereas I vvas Lord chief Iuſtice in all our confoederated provinces: and the richeſt of all Abrahams ſonns by Ketura. He hath puld me dovvne on every ſide: as never any for ſin. For Gods patience leadeth them in many degrees ſtill to repentance: and I goe avvay, vncapable of any benefit in this vvorld. His anger is kindled againſt me: and he houldeth me as one of his enimies. Elihu vvill reply vpon this, Chap. 33. 10. as that I complaine vpon vvrong, and cannot be heard, Ch. 34. 3. &amp;c. As he holdeth me as one of his enimyes, ſo he commeth vvith an hoſt againſt me: His hoſt of affliction in vvealth body and frinds come together againſt me: &amp; caſt vp their trench againſt me: and camp about my tent: my brethren, all honorers, my kinefolke, my promoted, my hirelinges, my maydens, my vvife: prinkockes, ſage counſelers, my tendered: And my body, is ſo leane, that it cleaveth to my bones: ſo full of ſores, that onely the fleſh of my teeth vvithin my lippes hath eſcaped.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:6204:64"/>
Therefore do ye perſecute me, as the Omnipotent hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth me as one of his enemies: and why are ye not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with my fleſh ſo eaten vp: but ye will as ſavage beaſts, eat my bones. And where ye ſay, that I am one that forget God: I have a ready anſwer for my hope: as Abraham taught vs in our fathers: how Adam loſt life, and brought death vpon all. But the S. of God will dwell in our tabernacle: and performe juſtice for vs: That as all being in Adam loſt life: ſo they who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the abundance of the grace of the gift of juſtice ſhall reigne by one. The abundance of grace is in this: That one diſobedience brought death: but the grace waſheth all ſoule ſore, from the ſole of the foot to the top of the head. Now of Abraham the God of Bethel will take fleſh: in Iſaac, his death and reſurrection were taught: with Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob he wreſtled, and ſhewed how his delite is to play with the ſonnes of Adam: Of Iuda he commeth, &amp; that tribe ſhall not be ſcattered till his Sonne commeth. Iacob in Meſtra land, where the great river Aegypt is, told all this in his laſt ſpeach: and thence we learned all. But as now we of Ketura in Iſmaels land, ſtick to God: and none of Iſraell forſake the Idols of Aegypt, ſo in tyme we ſhall have equall glory: though when they have the land of Canaan, and all muſt come thither, to worſhip, our children will not: but be enemies. Troupes of Camels ſhall cover the land: Dromedaries of Madian and Ghepha our houſe, and all of Saba: the Saba that robbed me, now godleſſe: they ſhall bring gold and incenſe: and preach the praiſe of the Eternall. Yea and wild Iſmael wilbe aſhamed of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and name them of Sara: and Cedar &amp; Nabaioth cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led commonly Nabathaea, ſhall ſerve the God of Bethel:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:6204:64"/>
the Angel that wreſtled with Iacob: in memorie of which ſtory, Iacob vvas called Iſrael: and the place, Phanuel. This I know, that ſeing in Abraham all families ſhalbe bleſſed, Abrahams naturall ſpecially. Now then I will bring the ſum of my faith: and ô that my words vvere written, and drawne in a book; graven with a pen of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, with lead were in ſtone for ever: How I know that my redeemer is the everliving: and at the laſt ſhall ariſe vpon the duſt: dying for our ſinnes, and ariſing for our juſtification. And after wormes ſpend this my ſkin &amp; fleſh, I meane, after my reſurrection, (and I vſe a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full terme, to conteyne both, <gap reason="foreign">

How often is his candle put out? not ſo often: that God doth lay vp his iniuries for his children, Ch. 5. 4. &amp; 20. 10. Can a man teach the Omnipotent knowledge, how he ſhall judge the loftie? One dieth in perfection: an other with a bitter ſoule: and never ate of good. As for the wealthy wicked, Ch. 5. 10. &amp; 20. 19. God doth not alwayes, lay vp his iniuries for his children: pay him that he doth feele it. Behold, I know your iniurious imaginations againſt me: when yee ſay, where is the pavilion of the wicked, Ch. 5. 3. I ſaw the wicked faſten root, but preſently did I curſe his dwelling: the hungry ſhall eat vp his harveſt, as the Caldeans: and the thirſty Sabeans ſhall ſwill vp, their wealth. And Ch. 20. 19. He oppreſſeth and leaueth poor: robbed of houſe, which he ſhall not build vp. I know your imaginations when ye ſay, where is the houſe of the noble tyrant?

This ſort is of leſſe weight in trade of life, then the face of waters which windes beat: their portion in the earth is curſed: tillage they regard not: nor planting of vines. Miſerably they live: &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably they die: taken to the grave as heat taketh ſnow: his mother and wife will ſoon forget him: onely his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſhalbe for wormes: and he is no more pittied then a tree cut downe: which hath no feeling.

God gave them a while ſecuritie to ſtay vpon: but his eyes were v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their wayes. A while they were exalted: but ſoon come to nothing: they are cut off as an eare of corne.
