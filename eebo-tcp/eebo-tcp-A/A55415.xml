            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Poor Robins Opinion of the preſent
Blazing-Star appearing in the
North-Eaſt part of the Heavens.</head>
            <p>I Think I need not fear Credit from the world, ſince they
are ſo ſenſible of my Judgment in Judicial Aſtrology,
which I think is equal to any that have writ before me,
or ſince; For I think I have had as good a gueſs at things, and
ſpoke as much Aſtrological Truth as <hi>Lilly</hi> or <hi>Booker</hi> of black
<hi>Monday.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I'le warrant you upon this occaſion if any Sadneſs or Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
ſhould fall out, which God divert, though with Reverence
and fear I ſpeak it. How they would tell ye they foreſaw it
a hundered years ſince, as they did the burning of <hi>London</hi> by
<hi>Noſtre Dame,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lillies</hi> Hierogliphicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was never
heard of before.</p>
            <p>But for my part as I have always told truth, and was leſs
miſtaken then any of my function, ſo I deſire to continue. For
'twas always my ſaying, if a <hi>Winter</hi> proved cold, warme Cloaths,
a good Fire, and good Proviſion was the beſt remedy.</p>
            <p>I Confeſs Mr. <hi>L</hi>—had the good Luck to get a Meddel from
the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> but for all that he could not tell the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
man who <hi>S</hi>—at his door.</p>
            <p>Like <hi>Gipſies</hi> we tell people their fortunes, or as People at a
Lottery get money.</p>
            <p>I hope the people will have more wit then to believe us,
and to have more diſcretion then to be frighted.</p>
            <p>However Since from General obſervation that things of
this Nature does not happen without Relation to further E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
and that they are Meſſengers from common experience of
the moſt High, it ought to be the care of every perſon to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Probable ſad conſequence, for by common experience we
find that after theſe occaſions hath hapned, National miſeries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52335:2"/>
VVhich to effect is for every man to ſweep his won door, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Engliſh Proverb.</p>
            <p>For we find it uſual when Men have Committed any enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and are diſcovered, they would feign eaſe themſelves of the
burthen of their follies, and either extenuate it in themſelves, or
unjuſtly lay it upon anothers ſhoulders.</p>
            <p>VVhen a general Calamily happens (or ſevere Judgment)
though before our Vanities were not regarded, the great and
Righteous Judge by his Ambaſſadour, Conſcience, the accuſing
faculty doth truly inform us it is from the occaſion of ſin (from
which we cannot receede nor deny,) yet forſooth we would
feign make ſome body elſe the Author of our own infirmities, and
wickedly lay them at other doors.</p>
            <p>The great danger of which, if Men did but rightly conſider
(they would ſhun with dilligence Immaginable) for whilſt
I charge my fault upon another, I do not purge my ſelf, and
therefore my Sin remains, and the cauſe not being taken away,
the effects conſequently muſt continue.</p>
            <p>And with great amazement I find for the moſt part they
would lay at their Princes door, not only fooliſhly to hope to
quiet their own uneaſie conſcience, but make him to bear the
Scandal of their Infirmities.</p>
            <p>But let ſuch Men have a care, for if Kings and Queens, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Opinion of our Divines, be the Nurſing Fathers
and Mothers of their Countries, we muſt have a great regard to
their Perſons and Honours (and above all things) to take a
Reverend care of expoſing their infirmities, for whatever evil
we ſhould here of them, if it prove falſe, to convey it to others,
is a moſt damnable Crime.</p>
            <p>But ſhould it prove true, we ſhould like <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japheth</hi>
take a Garment and lay it upon our Shoulders, and go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and cover the Nakedneſs of our Father, for fear like
<hi>Ham</hi> on the contrary, we ſhould Merit a curſe, which may be
intal'd upon our poſterity to the end of the VVorld. The
Common indignities and affronts done to their Royal Perſons
being not the Leaſt occaſion of our uſual diſappointments and
Judgments.</p>
            <p>VVe have a common ſaying in <hi>England</hi> to our Children, for
faults repeated before we correct them, you had fair warning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52335:3"/>
God Almighty never Puniſhes or afflicts without being
highly Provoked, and before he puts it in execution, trys us by
all means to avoid his chaſtiſements (if Poſſible) and to that
end often times intimates to us his diſpleaſure by ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
occaſion, becauſe he will not deal with us according to our
ſins, nor Reward us after our iniquities knowing us to be but duſt.</p>
            <p>VVhich may be taken from the preſent Meteor or appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and therefore 'tis great Prudence in us all by a holy habit and
diſpoſition to oppoſe and overcome thoſe threatning calamities
which we may reaſonably expect as the ſad effects of our preſent
condition.</p>
            <p>This commet or Blazing-Stars firſt appearance or riſing is in
the North-Eaſt Part of the Heavens, it is in Colour Red and
bloody, But the Poſition different from any that this Age hath
produced, The extremity or tayle being erect or upwards.</p>
            <p>VVhich may ſignifie that by lifting up our hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hearts
to God in devont Prayer and repentance we may avoid thoſe evils
it portends, which to effect, Let us fear God and honour the
King.</p>
