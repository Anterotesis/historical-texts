            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </head>
               <p>WE must distinguish between the intent of the threatner, and the intent and sense of the threatning.</p>
               <p>Law-threatnings may be well exponed, by the execution of them, upon persons, against whom they are denounced: As, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.30. compared with 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.15, 16. Ten Tribes are taken from <hi>Davids house according to the Word of the Lord.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause therefore the threatning of death was executed upon <hi>Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. then must the threatning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. have been intended against the Man <hi>Christ,</hi> and because beleevers die, as all do, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. the threatning must have been intended against them also,<note place="margin">The death threatned, <hi>Genes.</hi> 2.17. was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the intent of the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, partly legall, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</note> for that <hi>they sinned in Adam,</hi> and because it is out of question that the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate die the first and second death, the threatning must also have been intended against them. And therefore, in the intent of the threatner, the threatning was mixed, partly Legall, partly Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick; According to the respective persons, that the Lord had in his eye: He had therefore in his heart both Law and Gospel. It is therefore to no purpose to aske what kind of death, and whether purely legall, which the Lord threatned to <hi>Adam</hi>: For the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58986:11"/>
supposeth that the Covenant of Works was to stand, and that the Lord was to deny a Saviour to fallen man.

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. Adam</hi> was to believe he should certainly die; For so was the threatning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. if he should sin, or then we must say, that <hi>Adam</hi> was to beleeve he should not actually die, the latter cannot be said, for then he was to believe the contradicent of the <hi>Lords</hi> true threatning; which was the lie of the Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>Ans.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What threatnings are, and what sorts there be of them.</note> He was to beleeve neither of the twain according to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, for there are two sort of threatnings, some pure and only threatnings, which reveal to us, what <hi>God</hi> may, in Law, do, but not what he hath decreed and intended, <hi>actu secundo &amp; quoad eventum,</hi> to do, and bring to passe; These threatnings contain some condition, either expressed in other Scripture, or then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the mind of the <hi>Lord.</hi> 1. Because the Lord so threatned <hi>Adam,</hi> as he remained free and absolute either to inflict the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to provide an Evangelick remedy, even as <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.37. saith to <hi>Shimei (in the day thou passest over the brook Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, thou shalt surely die)</hi> that is, thou shalt be guilty of death, <hi>reus mortis:</hi>

               <p>Obj. <hi>Then in all threatnings and promises we are not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that though we sin, we shall actually</hi> &amp; quoad eventum <hi>die, and though we obey and beleeve, wee are not to beleeve that GOD shall fulfill his promise, and that our salvation shall come to passe, only we are to believe</hi> jure, <hi>that we deserve to die, and that we shall have eternall life,</hi> jure promissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, <hi>but not actually and according to the event.

                  </gap>l deserving of such threatnings legall, as alway are to be exponed and beleeved by all within the Visible <hi>Church,</hi> with an Evangelick exception of repentance. If therefore <hi>Adam</hi> did beleeve that he and all his should in their own persons actually suffer the first and second death, and that irrecoverably, he had no warrand, for any such belief, and the like may be said of <hi>Nineveh.</hi> For when the Lord said, <hi>in the day that thou eats thou shalt die, the first and second death,</hi> thou and all thy children personally; His meaning was, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I provide an Evangelick remedy and a Saviour. Godly fear trembles more at the darkning of the glory of the Lord in a broken Law, then at the event of inflicted wrath, were it even Hells fire.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Adam was to beleeve no such exception. Answ.</hi> True. Because it was not revealed, nor was he to beleeve the contrary that he should irrecoverably and eternally perish, because that


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58986:12"/>
was not revealed: But the threatning of the Law doth not deny the Evangelick remedy, as it neither doth affirme it.</p>

                  <note place="margin">What <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was to beleeve in the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, what the lying Serpent would have him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</note>Obj. <hi>Then was</hi> Adam <hi>to believe, it was true which the Serpent said, ye shall not surely die,</hi> &amp; quoad eventum, <hi>but ye shall be as Gods living and knowing good and evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Neither doth that follow, for in the meaning of the liar, it was not true, that they should not die, either by deserving (for Satan brangles the equity and righteousness of the Law and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) or actually and in the event, for both were false and neither revealed, and faith is not to go beyond what is revealed of God. And Sathan disputed against both the equity of the threatning, as if it had been unjust, in Law, and against the event, as a fiction and a thing that should not come to passe in the event, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed did not come to passe: but not according to the Serpents ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and false principles.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Was then</hi> Adam <hi>to despair and to beleeve nothing of a Saviour. Ans.</hi> He was not obliged to despaire, but to rely, by vertue of the first Commandement of the Decalogue, upon God infinitly powerfull, mercifull, gracious, and wise to save, for that was revealed and written in his heart, and that is far from despai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: But in the intervall between the fall and the Lords publishing the blessed Gospel, and news of the seed to come, he was so to trust in God for possible deliverance in generall (as the Law of Nature requireth) but he was to beleeve nothing of unrevealed particulars, far lesse of the mystery of the Gospel, <hi>which was kept secret, since the world began, Rom.</hi> 16.25.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Then may also the damned in Hell, who are not loosed from their obligation to the Law of Nature,</hi>

                  <hi>and the first Command, be obliged to rely on an infinite and Almighty God, for their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, for they are not obliged to despair, nor is there an obligation to any sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is not the like reason, for though the damned be not loosed from the Law of Nature, but are to rely upon God in his whole al-sufficiency, yet with exception of his revealed Justice and Truth: Now he hes expresly revealed, that <hi>their worm never dieth, and their fire never goeth out.</hi> And to believe that, is not to despaire. Obj. <hi>What are then such Heathens to beleeve as

touching that threatning, who never heard of the Gospel?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <p>What hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens are to believe.</p>
                     <p>The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair to the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>How the Gospel may be deduced from the Law, if an act of the free-will, grace and infinit wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of GOD be added to make good the assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
                     <p>How the promises are to be beleeved, and how in them, we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve both the equity and event of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, if the condition be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and how the difference must be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the threatnings</p>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> They are under the Law of Nature, and to beleeve that sin deserves wrath, according to the infinitnesse of the Majesty, against whom it is committed, and to obey the Law of Nature, and read the Book of the Creation carefully: But and if the news and rumor of a Saviour come to their ears, their sin cannot but be Evangelick, in not pursuing the reality and truth of such a soveraign remedy. Yet it is not to be thought, that though the Gospel be come to all Nations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.26. that that is to be meant. 1. Of every Generation of all Nations. Or, 2. of the individuall persons, either young, or come to age, of every Nation <hi>under Heaven,</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and Scripture speaketh against both.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But is not the Covenant of Grace contrary to the Law and Covenant of Works? Answ.</hi> A diversity there is, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wills in the holy Lord cannot be asserted. Yea the Gospel may be proven out of the Law, and from the first Commandement of the Decalogue, if any act of the Lords free will and infinite wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome shall be added to prove the Assumption. So,</p>
               <p>If the first Command teach that God is infinitely wise, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, gracious, just, and able to save, then, if so it please him, he shall save;</p>
               <p>But the first Command teacheth the former: And the Gospel revealing the unsearchable riches of Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8. expresly saith so much. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the promises, they contain not only the <hi>jus,</hi> equity and goodnesse of the thing promised, but also that the Lord shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually perform, yea and intends to perform, what he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon condition that we perform the required condition. And in this the promises differ not a little from these threatnings, that are only threatnings, of what God may do in Law, but not from these threatnings which are both threatnings and also Propheticall predictions of what shall come to passe, therefore must we here difference betwixt threatnings, and such and such threatnings.</p>
               <p>The promises are considered as they are Preached and anuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all within the Visible Church, and as they are made in the intention of God with the Elect and Sons of the promise: The same way the threatnings admit of a two-fold consideration. The

                     <p>The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises as annuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and as made.</p>

                  </note> reveal that both the Lord minds to give the blessing promised, and the condition that is grace to perform the condition, and so they are promises Evangelick both in the matter, and in the intention of the Lord: But as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned to the reprobate, who are alwayes from their birth to their death under a Covenant of Works, really as touching the LORDS holy Decree, they are materially Evangelick promises, but formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in the Lords intention legall, as every dispensation to them is legall, forasmuch as the Lord hath decreed to deny the grace, by which they may or can fulfill the condition of the promise, which is proper to the Law, as it is peculiar to the Gospel, that the Lord both gives the mercy promised and also the grace to fulfill the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the promise.</p>
               <p>The threatnings to beleevers, especially such as are legall <hi>(if you beleevers fall away,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Law-threatnings to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelick, and how.</note>

Nor that he wills that they should beleeve either their eternall damnation, or their finall and totall falling away, which inevitably leads thereunto. For they, knowing that they are in Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16, 17. and freed from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. are to beleeve the contraire of the former, to wit, life eternall, <hi>John</hi> 4.24. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.9. <hi>John</hi> 3.16. and the contraire of the latter, to wit, the promise of perseverance made to them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39, 40. <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.21. <hi>John</hi> 10.27, 28. <hi>John</hi> 17.20, 21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16, 17, 19. Therefore these threatnings are not to be beleeved by the regenerate, as certainly to come to passe in their persons, but only as Law-motives to presse them to work out their salvation in fear and trembling, and to cleave so much the closser to Christ, as the condition of such as are under the Law is apprehended to be dreadfull. But reprobats and unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are not to beleeve that God decrees and intends to them the thing promised, and grace to perform the condition, but only to beleeve their obligation to fiduciall relying upon, and Gospel-faith

Believers are to believe the Decree of God to save them, though they hear the threatnings, for its revealed. But the Reprobate are to beleeve only the sense and Law-deserving and event of the threatning, if they repent not, but are to beleeve no decree to save them.</p>

The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their sins and the wrath they are under is two wayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. 1. Materially in the bulke, and so they are under Law-stroaks and Law-wrath, that is Law-punishment, as others are, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. and so the other places are to be taken. 2. The wrath is to be considered formally, and so it is denyed that the punishment of the non-converted elect, because of their sinfull way is any part of the Law-vengeance or curse which Christ did bear for their other sins committed by them after conversion. 1. Because when Christ

saith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.4.

Beleevers are delivered, in <hi>Christ,</hi> from the victory, sting, power of sin, curse of the Law, and every curse, that is in affliction, and from condemnation not in part only, but in whole: Else their triumph were but in part, contrair to, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54, 55, 56.<note place="margin">The Elect non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted bear no part of the Law-curse, but CHRIST bare all.</note>

Therefore the half or a part of satisfactory vengeance, cannot be upon us, and the other half on <hi>Christ,</hi> for this is to make men and Martyrs joint satisfiers of justice with Christ, by their own blood and sufferings, to prevent the scaddings of purgatory; For though we teach against <hi>Antinomians,</hi> that the Godly are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for sins according to Justice, yet that is Evangelick, not law-justice, for they bear not one dram weight of satisfactory wrath and curse jointly with Christ, <hi>Antinomians</hi> say that sin, root and branch is taken away in Justification, so that there is no sin nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for sin in the justified man. 4.

near the opinion of these, who make faith a cause of satisfaction for sin, as they must teach who hold that Christ payed a ransome, on the crosse, for the sins of all and every one.

Now nothing given to the Justice of God by way of satisfaction for the sins of unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, was ever repeated or taken back again by Christ. Nay but, say they, the ransome was not payed at all for <hi>Judas,</hi> but only, upon condition that he beleeve: but he never beleeved, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was never payed for <hi>Judas.

Divine Justice for sins, must be halfed and parted between <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> which the Scripture teaches not. Also the Father ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accepts the ransome of Christ, because it is intrinsecally, and of it self sufficiently satisfactory: or because <hi>Iudas</hi> does beleeve it is so; The latter cannot be said, for beleeving adds nothing to the intrinsecall sufficiency of the satisfaction, as not believing dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes nothing from the sufficiency thereof; Yea and so the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers formall reason of accepting of the satisfaction of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> must be terminated upon our poor act of believing, whereas the formal ground of the acceptation thereof is the intrinsecall excellency and worth of the Sacrifice, <hi>being an offering of a sweet smelling sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to God,</hi>

And the reason why he accepts it for <hi>Peter,</hi> not for another, is the election of grace.</p>
               <p>It is true the blood is a price refuseable, but it is this way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseable, because the Lord might have followed a Law-way with <hi>Adam,</hi> and all his sons, and have denyed to give his Son a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some for us, but it is not refuseable, because of any insufficiency in the Ransome. Now faith is to satisfaction as the approximation of, and the laying on of dry fewell to the fire, which is only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of burning, but the fire is the formall cause of burning. Yea if we speak properly faith is not so much as a condition without the which offended Justice is not satisfied, nor is it a condition, by any Scripture of the world, without the which God laid not our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities on Christ, for whether we beleeve or not, <hi>God laid our iniquities upon him, and made him sin for us, Isa.</hi> 53.6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. Therefore, by necessity of Justice, he must accept that Ransome intrinsecally so sufficient, which did restore more glory to God, then the sins of all, for whom Christ died, took from him. Nor is it imaginable to say that any act of obedience or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, can perfect the satisfaction of Christ, and make it suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, yea, or causatively make it ours. For God, by no necessity of Justice, but of his own free pleasure, requireth faith as a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our actuall reconciliation; for beside, that he might have


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58986:15"/>
required any other act of obedience, as love, he might have acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted the Ransome without inquiring any act of obedience, on our part, as the Lord bestowed a calme Sea and deliverance from ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, upon the Idolatrous Sea-men, upon the very act of casting <hi>Ionah</hi> in the Sea, without the intervention of any saving faith on their part;<note place="margin">God may accept the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Christ</hi> without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on our part.</note> As a gracious Prince may send a pardon to free a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Malefactor from death, and may command that it be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid in Law for him, without the mans knowledge, and far more without his acceptance thereof, upon his knees, especially since by a speciall paction between the Father and the Son, he restored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly more Glory to God by suffering for all, for whom he died, then they took from God by their sins, and that restitution was made to Justice without the interveening of any act of the creatures obedience. But the truth is, it is much to be doubted whether they, who hold such a satisfaction to be given of God, for the sins of all, Elect and Reprobate, but so as it shall not be valid in Law, nor effectuall to quiet Justice, but they must all suffer eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall vengeance, and perform personall satisfaction, in Hell, to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, except there interveen an act of obedience of the creature, to make it effectuall, do really and sincerely acknowledge, against <hi>Socinians,</hi> a reall satisfaction and compensation made to offended Justice by Christ: For how is it reall, and not rather scenicall and formall, which may and should be null and in vain, if the creature make it not reall, by beleeving. And especially, if God out of his grace which is absolutely free, work in us the condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving.

after the fall, but of his procreating of children, of the Patriarchs, of <hi>Adams</hi> dying and of his actings before the fall, the place of Paradice being scarce well known, which sayes the Lord had a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther design to lay aside the transient Law-dispensation and to set up <hi>Christ.</hi> 2.

                  <note place="margin">
                     <p>The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall decree of <hi>Adams</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, if he should doe the Law, was not predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>

                  <hi>if he should continue in obedience.

               <p>Q. <hi>Was not</hi> Adam <hi>chosen? Ans. Adam,</hi> according to the Lords designe, <hi>finaliter &amp; objectivè</hi> was created in the state of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination to glory, and grace in Christ as touching his person, but according to his inherent condition, he was created in a legall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, which was a gracious inlet to Christ; And according to his Law-state as he represented all mankinde, he was Created as a lubrick and frail Coppie of weak nature.</p>
               <p>Many who are such as are not chosen are Created and live under a Covenant of Works, having onely some concomitant favours of the Gospel, as the Preaching thereof. 2.

Only if this be called Grace, that the nature of man is so ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Gospel mercy, and the nature of the fallen Angels moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie not so. 2.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58986:16"/>
should have a share of Gospel-Grace, but it may be replyed to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why should it seeme to be a part of the goodnesse and bounty of <hi>God</hi> to will and desire all and every one to be saved, and not to institute such a dispensation, as all and every one should actuallie be saved? 2. How should that stand, (<hi>he hath mercy on whom he will</hi>) if free-will of the creature absolutely dispose of Salvation and damnation? 3.

Yet from this it followes, no more that these are two Covenants, then that there be two Covenants of Grace, Because faith in God, and the Morall Law in an Evangelick way are therein commanded, and also some duties touching the seals by a positive Law are therein contained.</p>

Common sense will say no more follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but goodnesse and bounty intrinsecall are essentiall to God, and these attributes are essentiall to him, and were from eternity in him, and are his good and bountifull nature; Though not either man, Angel, or any thing else had been created, to which he doth actually extend his goodnesse. <hi>Ergo,</hi> this actuall extension of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is not essentiall to God, so neither is the actuall punishing of sin essentiall to God, but free, though <hi>Adam</hi> apprehended God would punish his eating of the forbidden tree; Yet if he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended that he should not be God, if he did not punish it, his apprehension was erroneous. And this only followes that there is an intrinsecall and internall Justice in God, naturall and essentiall in God, but so that the out-goings of his Justice, the egressions are most free, and that is said by some without all reason, because <hi>the apprehensions we have naturally of God that he punisheth sin, Vniversales apprehensiones, nequaquam sunt eorum quae Deo vel adesse vel abesse possunt pro liberrimâ voluntate.</hi> Universall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions, therefore they are not apprehensions of such things as may be, or not be in God, according to his free pleasure, if the apprehensions of Gods doing good to Angels, to men, to all his creatures freely, be in all by nature, and cannot be rooted out, and be universall, then these apprehensions cannot be of such things as are in God, according to his most free will, and may be in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty or not be <hi>in him.</hi>

Then the so doing must be in God essentially. 2. Then must God not be God, if he do not good freely to them. 3. Then must God not be God, except he create men, Angels, and creatures. 4. But since he is God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting, he must from everlasting have created men, Angels, and the creatures, and from everlasting he must punish sin; Life may be considered. 1.

               <p>In the former consideration, life is either considered as the end, or secondly as a free reward.<note place="margin">Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with GOD in Glory, is a reward not due by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but by the free gift of GOD, to the most perfect law-obedience.</note> In the former respect.

And God may put the respect of a reward upon any obedientiall end. But that <hi>Adam</hi> should have such an eminent life, for the reward of his obedience as a communion with God, which is farre above his obedience, is the free donation of God: nor is there any necessary connexion between <hi>Adams</hi> perfect obedience, and so high and eminent a life, nor can this Covenant, as touching such a promise, be written in his heart. God then never loved to make any Covenant, yea even that of Works, without some acts and out-goings of grace, and the hyre was grace, how is he not to be served, who loves to hyre and allure us to be happy?</p>

Or how could such justice, by that action be debarred? since justice did not exact such an action: If without violation of justice it might have been omitted, if God should have been infinitely just from Eternitie, if he had done no such thing? Shall a Prince get himself glory in the name of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, by doing that which, by his absolute Soveraignety, he may leave undone without hurt of justice.</hi>

The Lord punished Christ for us to declare the glory of his Justice in punishing sin in his own Son, who was the sinner by imputation, for out of the depth of infinite wisedome, the Lord freely imposes a law upon his creatures: He might have imposed no such law under such a punishment. By no necessity of nature did the Lord threaten death, for the eating the fruit of that tree, prove, that God should not have been God, except he had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned death for the eating of that fruit, and except he had punished


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58986:25"/>
that eating with death, either to be inflicted upon the eater or his surety. <hi>Quid haeres</hi>? Prove that by the Word of <hi>God,</hi> it is sin to eat, when <hi>God</hi> forbids; but the Lords soul hates sin. True, but does the Lords soul hate sin naturally, as he loves himself and by necessity of his essentiall justice as contradistinguished from his immutabilitie, and his truth and faithfulnesse, according to which attributes, he decreed and said, <hi>that the soul that sins shall die,</hi> and (<hi>he that eats shall die</hi>) and he cannot change, nor alter, what he hath decreed, and cannot but be true in his threatnings. But the Question is, whether (laying aside the respect of Gods unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse and truth) there be such a connexion internall, between eating and dying, or between eating forbidden of God, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, as God cannot be equally and essentially just, nor can he be God, except he punish forbidden eating; for sure eating of that fruit, is not of its nature, sin, but it is sin, from the only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding will of <hi>God,</hi> for the Lord had been no lesse essentially just, had he commanded <hi>Adam</hi> to eat of the Tree of Knowledge. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is punished from the forbidding will of <hi>God,</hi> for say that to be punishable or to be punished be essentiall to sin, if eating of such fruit be sin from the forbidding will of <hi>God,</hi> the essence thereof must be from the same forbidding will, then must it follow that <hi>God</hi> hates not all sin, by necessity of nature; And that he hates such eating only conditionally, if he forbid it; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But it is against common sense, to infer, <hi>Ergo,</hi> God sent his Son, by necessity of love, and mercy, and free Grace. So that he should not have been infinitly loving, mercifull, gracious, if he had never sent him. And it is as poor Logick to say, because of grace and free-love he sent his Son, and so might not have sent him, as to say he loved where there was no need,<note place="margin">

All the Scriptures cryes that out of free grace the Lord sent his Son, and delivered him to death; <hi>By the grace of God He tasted death for every man,</hi> Heb. 2.9. Shall we infer there was then no necessity that he should die? It is safest to say the only wise God decreed that sin should be. 2. That the glory of his Justice should appear in taking away sin, not in our way, but in the way of God, to wit, in a way of justice, of mercy, of free grace, in incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable love, of mighty power; and in all these so acts the Lord as he should not leave off to be the Lord, but acts most freely, though he had not taken that course. But far be it from the godly not to adore him in this, as the admirable way beyond the thoughts of men and Angels.</p>

               <p>In all pactions between the Lord and man, even in a Law-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant there is some out-breakings of Grace. Its true, there was no Gospel-Grace, that is a fruit of Christs merite in this Covenant. But yet if grace be taken for undeserved goodnesse: There are these respects of grace. 1. That <hi>God</hi> might have given to <hi>Adam</hi> something inferiour to the glorious Image of God, that consists in true righteousnesse, knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> and holinesse, <hi>Gen</hi> 1.26. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. It was a rich enough stock, this holy Image to be so badly guided. And who looks spiritually to their receipts? Its either too much of grace and holinesse that another hath, and too little that I have, so arises virtuall sighing and grudging at the dispensation. Or 2. a swelling that it is so much, as if it were not receiving. <hi>I am holier then thou, Isa.</hi> 65.5. a miskenning of him that makes me to differ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. A blecking of others, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11. A secret quarrelling at <hi>God</hi> as too strick and hard in his rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.24. And what pride is this, because I am a meer patient under gifted holinesse, to usurpe it as mine own? As if a horse should kick and fling, because he wears a borrowed sadle of silk for a day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Being and dominion over the creatures is of undeserved good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Who looks to a borrowed body and a borrowed soul,<note place="margin">Being, life, and self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are undeserved favours.</note> yea and to <hi>self,</hi> and to that which is called <hi>I,</hi> as to a thing that is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gifted? So that though thou be in an high opinion of self, self is self, and what it is, from <hi>God.</hi> And when thou rides, whence is it that I am the rider, and the wearied horse the carrier, but from <hi>God?</hi> 3. The Covenant of Works it self, that <hi>God</hi> out of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty does not command, is undeserved condescending; that <hi>God</hi> bargains for hire, <hi>do this and live,</hi> whereas he may bide a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Law-giver and charge and command us, is overcoming good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.

The influences to acts of obedience, come under a twofold consideration. 1. As congruous and suitable concurrences of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Adams</hi> acts of obedience: And so they were free gifts to <hi>Adam</hi> not promised, as we shall hear in the New Covenant. 2. As such influences by which the standing Elect Angels (who

What Godly trembling is required in us?<note place="margin">Gifts and habits of saving grace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep creatures on foot.</note> 5.

There can be no giving and taking between the creature and the Creator. <hi>Elihu pleads well for him,</hi> Job 35.7. <hi>If thou be righteous what gives thou to him? Or what receiveth he of thy hand,</hi> v. 1. <hi>Thy wickednesse may hurt a man, as thou art, and thy righteousnesse may profite the Son of man.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling thoughts that God needs not men, nor their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, nor any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, shuld take us up.</note> Job 22.2. <hi>Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable to himself?

It is some shining of the excellency of God upon men and Angels, from the works of God, and our obedience to him. But suppose there were no creature to pay the rent of this glory to him, is the Lord a loser therefore? Hath he need of our songs of glory? Or that creatures should be Heraulds of his praise?

                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:58986:29"/>
The father by no paction can remove the foundation of the debt of nature that the son oweth to the father: for impossible it is, but if such a man be son to such a man, but he owe to his father as to an instrument, <hi>quod sit &amp; vivat,</hi> being and living, and the son can not satisfie by paying the father for that summe, and the father can not cancell the band nor give him an acquittance. Far lesse can any recompence the Lord for life and being. The fallen Angels and damned in hell and all wicked men are in the Lords Compt-book everlasting debters to him for being. But <hi>God</hi> who is more then a Father (to whom men are but painted fathers) may thus farre loose the bond, as he may command the son to sacrifice the father, as well as once he commanded the father <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up his son to <hi>God.</hi> But <hi>God</hi> cannot resigne his right that he hath over the creature to a creature, because he cannot leave off to be Creator, and so cannot lay aside or make over Creator-right, <hi>jus Creatoris,</hi> to any.<note place="margin">God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not quite or part with Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor-right &amp; universall dominion over all things that may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and therefore nothing can be given to him.</note> 2. Say that a creature had a <hi>jus</hi> or right over the Creator, it is either an uncreated right or a created right, so to pursue <hi>God</hi> by Law, as to cause him do him justice; it cannot be an uncreated right; for that were near to blasphemie: For no created head can bear the royall Crown of the King of Ages. If it be a created right, this created right must be under the dominion of him who is universall Lord of all: then may the Lord make use of it at his pleasure; then may not the man make use of it at his pleasure: for an absolute dominion of one and the same thing cannot be in the hands of two absolute Lords, who may have contradictory desires concerning the same thing: such as the holy Lord and sinfull men often are. Let us correct the bold pleadings and the daring char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that our vain hearts put upon the <hi>Lord: Why dost thou strive against him</hi> (saith <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job 33.13.) <hi>for he gives not account of any of his matters?</hi> Men dare say, when they are under the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of ordinary sufferings, <hi>The wayes of the Lord are not equal,</hi> Ezek. 33.10. <hi>If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how shall we then live?</hi> But upon whom should sins and transgressions and the punishment thereof be,<note place="margin">We are not to strive with the gracious Lord.</note> if not upon the carcases of the Authors?

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58986:30"/>
that saith something against the veracity and faithfulnesse of <hi>God,</hi> but nothing against the justice. But neither doth a promise as a promise raise a plea of unjustice against the holy and glorious Lord, suppose he should not fulfill his promise. For 1. A paction by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise creats no equality of justice between thing and thing, between wage and work: otherwise he that is called to the Vineyard, and labours from the third hour, hath a just plea: for he should have more wages then a penny, which he gets who labours but one hour.<note place="margin">The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but not the proportion betwixt works and wage is the Lords rule in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding our labour, nor should we be gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, if the <hi>Lord</hi> shuld so deal with us.</note> But the <hi>Lord</hi> makes not the equality or proportion between much labouring for many hours, and the quantity and degree of the wage his r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It followes from the Parable, that Gods bargaining with us depends not upon the equality between thing and thing, the work and the wage; But upon his own free pleasure of disposing of his own: And it is the froathinesse of our nature to judge the penny of Glory, that we get by labouring to be our own, whereas after the promise, and after we have fulfilled the condition, it is not ours, but Gods, and he calls it his own, and it is to be disposed on by the Lords free-grace.

No promise as a promise can give us a proper right, by way of strict justice, to plead with God. 1. A promise of grace is a free promise, and no man can say, because <hi>God</hi> promises the new heart to most undeserving men, that are of a stony heart, and doe profane his holy name, amongst the Gentiles, that therefore it is just by condignitie of the thing,<note place="margin">A promise as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise can give us no right of strict ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to any reward.</note> that a new heart should be given to them, that are <hi>foolish, disobedient, and serving diverse lusts.</hi> The farrest that hard faced Jesuits go in this, is to tell us of the poor penny of the merit of congruity, for the right weight of the summe and thousands of saving grace which Papists have refused as ashamed thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If a promise as a promise should make an equalitie between one thing and another, and so lay a band of strict commutative ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice upon God, then should every promise do the like, <hi>quod con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venit <gap reason="foreign">

Even so the promise of <hi>God</hi> to give eternall life to the obedience of <hi>Adam</hi> can make no equality of strict justice between the reward and the wage; For the reward promised for the wages is equall and just before the promise, and <hi>ex naturâ rei</hi>; and so must lay bands on the Lord, so as he cannot do contrair unto it, which is against all reason.</p>

There is no Spirit of God that suggests to them despaire, and bids them write them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the black roll of Reprobates, for though they beleeve hell, as the Devils haply beleeve there is a <hi>God,</hi> yet they blow the coals of that hellish furnace, and kindle a fire before night. 3. They being under the Law of Nature, are to rely on infinite mercy able to save. Their witty darknesse of unbeleef saith they beleeve, but they hate mercy in the generall toward others, as to themselves. 2.

                  </note> and to obey to the end, all influences granted to <hi>Adam,</hi> to will and to do, were granted to him. 1.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There are two bastard grounds devised by <hi>Arminians.</hi> 1. Because the Covenant of Works cannot oblidge both to active and passive obedience, but to one of them only (say they) and the Covenant of Works was so rigid, that <hi>God</hi> could not follow it out, and cast infants in hell for a sin which is theirs, only by imputation, and was pardoned to the first man that committed it. Therefore he was necessitated to make a Covenant of Grace with all mankind, none excepted. But the Covenant of Works is broken, and can now be a way of Justification and salvation to none, but yet it oblidges all. And sin cannot make us lawlesse, for the spirituall Law is of an eternall obligation. 2. They that never heard of Christ, perish by the Law, and not by the Covenant of Grace of

                     </gap> obedience alwayes.</note> and the Gospel is written in the heart of none. 3. The first Covenant was holy and spirituall, and <hi>God</hi> should unjustly threaten death upon infants, if they be not guilty of eternall condemnation, as <hi>Arminius, disp. pub.</hi> 7. <hi>th.</hi> 16.3. and the Scripture saith, infants are guilty of this sin, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Job</hi> 14.4. As also Christ must not have died for the sins of Infants, if there be no sin in them, they need not the ransome of Christs Blood. The other bastard ground is,<note place="margin">There is sin in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</note> the naturall antecedent desire and love of <hi>God</hi> to have all saved, moved him (say they) to make this Covenant of Grace with all.

                     </gap>ull.</note>1. In the subservient, <hi>God</hi> only approves righteousnesse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes sin; in that of Grace he pardons and renues. <hi>Ans. Acts</hi> 15.11. <hi>We beleeve through the Grace of the Lord Jesus, we shall be saved even as they under that Covenant.</hi> Acts 10.43. <hi>To him gave all the Prophets witnesse, that through his Name, whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beleeveth in him, shall receive remission of sins.

                  <hi>and I will not remember thy sins.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> was a man according to the heart of <hi>God,</hi> So <hi>Asa, Josiah, Jehoshaphat, Samuel, Baruch, Gedeon, Daniel,</hi> the Prophets, under that subservient Covenant (except they be under a fourth Covenant) were renued, justified, saved by faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. as under a Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The former was, <hi>do and live,</hi> this was, <hi>believe and live. Ans.

               <p n="4">4. In the former is compulsion and the Spirit of bondage, in this heart inclining freedom and the Spirit of Adoption. <hi>Ans.</hi> Yet the differences are accidentall, there was a legall awing of the hearts, as if they had been Servants, yet Heirs and Sons they were, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 2. The whole Book of the Proverbs spake to the Godly as to Adopted Sons. They were beleevers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. and so Sons as touching a spirituall state, <hi>John</hi> 1.11, 12. In regard of Oeconomie, it was somewhat more rigid and legall, they were restrained as servants; Yet it was the Covenant of Grace, by which beleeving Jews were justified and saved, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the former man is dead, in this man is humbled for sinne? <hi>Answ.</hi> Legally dead, except they would flee to Christ, and legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned, but there was true humiliation for sins under that Covenant: As <hi>David, Josiah, Hezekiah,</hi> and all beleevers then, as now, were pardoned and justified.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In the former there are commands, not strength, but here there be promises and grace given? <hi>Ans.</hi> The full abundance of grace and of a new heart, was reserved untill now. And the Law could not make perfect nor give pardon, in the blood of beasts; as touching that legall dispensation: But both grace, the Spirit,


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58986:39"/>
pardon, righteousnesse and life were received and beleeved; by looking on Christ to come.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In the former, <hi>Canaan</hi> was promised, in this, Heaven. <hi>Ans. Canaan</hi> is promised only but sacramentally, and that was a poeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogicall promise for the infancie of that Church, but a type which was then in that Covenant, and is not now, make not two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, one then, and another now? Except ye say, there was then a Lamb in the Passeover, which was a Type of Christ to come, and there is now no such Type, because the body is come, and Christ the true High Priest offered himself. Therefore there are two Christs, one then to come, another now who hath come al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.

               <p>But the truth is, the Law as pressed upon <hi>Israel</hi> was not a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Law as the Law or as a Covenant of Works is made with perfect men who need no mercy; But this Covenant is made with sinners, with an expresse preface of mercy: <hi>I am the Lord thy God that brought thee out of the land of Egypt,</hi> &amp;c.

with real mercies (so that it cannot be called the favour of a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and instituted or positive priviledge belonging only to the Jews) as that his seed is blessed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.26. <hi>Psal.</hi> 112.2. This mercy must be taken away either in mercie or in wrath: but that a real mercy of a blessing should be taken away in mercy, except a spirituall mercy of saving grace in Christ were given in place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, cannot be said, far lesse hath it any truth that a real mercy can be removed in wrath from Infants in Jesus Christ, in whom the Nations are blessed. And we see, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. the blessing of an observed Covenant, and the curses of a broken Covenant are exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the fruit of the body to the sons and the daughters, <hi>v.</hi> 418.32. <hi>Job</hi> 21.19. <hi>Job</hi> 29.14. <hi>Job</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. And that this is not a New Testament dispensation, who can say? And that outward positive favours are bestowed on Infants, is clear. (1.) That Christ laid his hands on them and blessed them, making them a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed copy of the indwellers of his Kingdom. (2) The promises of the Covenant are made to them, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. (3.) They are clean and holy by Covenant holinesse, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. which cannot be meant of being born of the marriage-bed. For <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 11.16. saith the same of the Jews, root and branches, Fathers and Children: And no man dreamed that <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 11. intends to prove that the Jews shall be insert in again, because they are free of bastardie Father and sons. Now Infants understand no more any of rhese to be blessed by the laying on of the hands of Christ, and to be such as have title to the promises, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. and to be Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-wise holy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. then they understand Baptism. (4.) The same Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> is made with the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>I will be their God, and they shall be my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Which is Prophesied of the Gentiles under the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Ezek</hi> 11.17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Ezek</hi> 34.23, 24, 25. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.36, 37, 38, 39, 40. <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Hos.</hi> 1.10, 11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9, 10.

of all Covenant-right, which was due to them of old un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Covenant which the Lord calls <hi>faultie: Egypt shall be my people,</hi> except their 1. Infants. 2. And except their aged, and their non-Saints. (5.) Infants in the former Covenant had right by birth to the means of salvation, to be taught and Catechised in the Law of the Lord, because born of Covenanting Parents within the Visible Church, and so had title to Covenant-calling, and GODS Covenant-choising, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.4. as is clear, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. <hi>I know Abraham will command his Children and his houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, Exod.</hi> 20.10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6, 6, 7. <hi>And thou shall teach them diligently unto thy Children, Exod.</hi> 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26, 27. <hi>Ps.</hi> 78.4, 5, 6. Now if Infants be without the Covenant as the Infants of Pagans, then they have no more Covenant-right to the hearing of the Gospel, and a treatie with Christ, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, then Pagans have. Its not enough to say their Fathers owe that much naturall compassion to their souls, as to teach them, it being a Parents duty; Yea, but what warrand hath a Father as a Father to make offer of a Covenant of Grace in the Name of GOD to one Pagan more then to another, since all are equally without the Covenant, if there be a Covenant-call warranted to them, where is the Fathers command to propone and ingadge the Covenanters consent, if the Children be Pagans? but as they have a right by birth to the call, they being born where the call soundeth, they must have some visible right to the Covenant it self, more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pagans. Its but of small weight to say that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>Paul</hi> expoundeth that in the New Testament, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed,</hi> only of the spirituall seed, such as <hi>Jacob,</hi> who was predestinated to Glory, not of those that are carnally descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of <hi>Abraham,</hi> otherwise it should follow, that these that are in the Covenant, might believe that they should be saved, though void of Faith and Repentance.<note place="margin">The place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6. vindicated from the unsound gloss of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers of Infant Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism.</note> 
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The purpose of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. is to Answer a sad Objection: if the Jews be cast off, and rejected of God, as <hi>Paul,</hi> by his extreame desire to have them saved, insinuates, then <hi>the Word of God takes no effect,</hi> and his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and choising of them for his people, takes no effect, <hi>v.</hi> 6.

according to the flesh: Others <hi>sons of promise,</hi> and chosen of God.

(2.)

The speciall intent of <hi>God</hi> in sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the word of the Covenant must evidence this; he sends not the Gospel unto, and for the cause of one man, to bring him in, but to gather a Church and his elect ones, by a visibly and audibly Preached Covenant to a society, to a City; to <hi>Samaria.

The Lord in one <hi>Abraham,</hi> in one <hi>Cornelius,</hi> in one <hi>Jayler,</hi> (whom he effectually converts as far as we can gather from the Scriptures) choises the race, house, society, nation, and gives them a Covenant-holinesse, the mans being born where the call of <hi>God</hi> is, does the turn, as much as the faith of the Parent. For by the root is not necessarily meant the Physicall root the father. For <hi>Abraham</hi> was not the Physicall root and father,<note place="margin">The being born where the Gospel sounds, of that nation &amp; race, is the ground of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes as well as the faith of the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest parents</note> nor <hi>Cornelius</hi> of all the servants and friends in the house. But if a friend be in the house, or society, and professe the Gospel, he and his obtain right to Baptism and the means of salvation.

                  <hi>Acts</hi> 8. and that, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. to prove that only such should be baptized, who beleeve actually and are come to age: They prove that the Church sinneth, if they ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize any, but such as are predestinated to life and really beleeve. For the faith that <hi>Philip</hi> asked for, was reall, <hi>with all the heart,</hi> not as the faith of <hi>Simon Magus</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the faith, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. is real saving faith, that brings salvation; <hi>he that beleeves is saved.</hi> 2.

Yet upon that faith he was not saved, being <hi>in the gall of bitternesse</hi> (3.) <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves not, is damned.</hi> The meaning must be, he that beleeves not savingly is damned: Or then he that beleeves not visibly, as <hi>Magus,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> is damned, but this is most false, for <hi>Peter</hi> beleeves not as <hi>Judas,</hi> and yet he is not damned: Or then the meaning must be, he that beleeveth both really, savingly, and also professedly and visibly, is saved. And that is true, but it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that none are to be baptized, but both real and visible belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. 4. If it be true that none are to be baptized but Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted ones, as <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. And if none be Covenanted ones under the New Testament, but real beleevers and such as are predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to life, as our Anabaptists teach from <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. then must the Church without warrant of the Word baptize <hi>Magus, Demas, Judas.</hi> (5.)

Paraeus, Calvin, Beza</hi>; and our Divines speak on these places against the auricular confession of all the huge multitude. (6.) It is a wonder that any man should dream that the Eunuch made a case of conscience, Acts 8. whether it was lawfull to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> to baptize, and not whether he himself did beleeve and could worthily receive the seal, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.36. here is water (saith he) <gap reason="foreign">

Only these whether old or young that are, <hi>tali modo visibili federati,</hi> such as professedly and visibly in Covenant, and called, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. are warrantably baptized. Hence they must be so in Covenant, as they be called by the word of the Covenant, for they cannot be baptized against their will, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.29.30.</p>

It were, sure, unfaithfull dealing to <hi>John</hi> to say


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58986:54"/>
so. For the four pence ought not, by this Covenant, to be given to him, except he work twelve hours: but he cannot, without palpable falshood, say, I have broken no Covenant, in not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king twelve hours: For though I consented to the Covenant, and began to work an hour, yet the promise was not to me simply, but to me as working twelve hours;<note place="margin">A condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant hath the compleat essence &amp; nature of a Covenant, and they are truly in Covenant that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</note> but there is neither face nor faith in this Answer: For the fulfilling of the Covenant is only to give four pence to <hi>John,</hi> if he work twelve hours; But the promise and Covenant was made to him, and he hath foully broken. Yea a conditionall Covenant agreed unto and accepted, is a Covenant, if we shall (as in reason we ought) distinguish between a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, in its essence and nature, and a Covenant broken or fulfilled, a Covenant or threatning, is a Covenant and threatning oblidging <hi>Adam,</hi> if it shall be agreed unto, by silence, as <hi>Adam</hi> accepted the threatning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. by silence, and Professours within the Visible Church, by their professing of the Doctrine of the Gospel or Covenant of Grace, their receiving of the seals and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed hearing of the Word, are under the Covenant of Grace, and engadge themselves to obey commands, promises, threatnings, and therefore promises are as properly made to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. as commands, and threatnings, exhortations, invitations, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel requests are made to them. But tho the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly confound <hi>the promise,</hi> and the thing promised; the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and benefits Covenanted. <hi>The promise is to you,</hi> and so are the commands, &amp; threatnings, whether ye beleeve or not, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is to you, and layes an obligation on you, whether ye obey or obey not, and the threatnings are to you, whether ye transgress, or transgresse not. It is true, indeed, the promise, that is, the blessing promised, righteousnesse and eternall life is not given to you, untill ye first beleeve. <hi>Object.</hi> Is not the promise made the same way to the aged as to the children, and the same thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of both: <hi>The promise is to you and to your children.

Nay. We beleeve many Infants (we reserve to the Holy and Glorious Lord his liberty of election and reprobation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 12.) among the Jews were saved by the Covenant of Grace, though they died Infants.

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But is not this an approven distinction, that persons are within the Covenant, either <hi>externally, professedly, visibly,</hi> or <hi>internally, really,</hi> or according to the intention of God? <hi>Ergo,</hi> such as are externally within the Covenant, are not really &amp; indeed within the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Adverbe (<hi>really</hi>) relates to the reall fruit of the fulfilled Covenant, and so such as are only externally within the Covenant,<note place="margin">How vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors are really with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, &amp; not really within it.</note> are not really within the Covenant, for God never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, nor intended to bestow the blessing Covenanted, nor grace to perform the condition of the Covenant upon them? But they are <hi>really</hi> Covenanted and engadged by their consented profession to fulfill the Covenant. And as the commands and threatnings of the Covenant of Grace lay on a reall obligation, upon such as are only externally in Covenant, either to obey or suffer, so the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the Covenant imposes an ingagement and obligation upon such to beleeve the promise, but some times, we say the promises of the Covenant of Grace are not <hi>really</hi> made to the Reprobate within the Visible Church, because God intends and decrees to, and for them, neither the blessing promised, nor the saving grace to fulfill the condition or to beleeve. And therefore these words are figurative, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. <hi>This is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, I will write my Law in their minds,</hi> &amp;c. that is, this is the speciall and principall Covenanted blessing, I will give them a new heart: which must not be called a simple pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, though a prediction it is, but it is also a real promise made absolutely to the elect, which the Lord fulfills in them: And this is called the Covenant. Because 1. they are no better then non-Covenanters upon whom the Lord bestowes not this part and blessing of the Covenant. 2. The truth is, the promise of a new heart is not made to the Visible Church, which is only Visible: but to the Elect and Invisible Church. And if Anabaptists shall expone these words, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. <hi>The promise of a new heart is made to you and to your children, upon condition that you and your children beleeve,</hi> which they cannot do untill first they have a new heart, its as good as <hi>Peter</hi> had said, <hi>God promiseth to you

and to your children grace to beleeve, and a new heart to obey him, upon condition that you first beleeve.</hi> And that is,<note place="margin">The new heart is not promised to all, who ought to repent and to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</note> 
                  <hi>Gods promise to you to beleeve upon condition that ye beleeve,</hi> which is ridiculous, and therefore we cannot say that this promise of a new heart is made to all that are commanded to beleeve and repent and be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized. For Elect and Reprobate and all are under these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, if they be members of the Visible Church: But the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of a new heart is not made to all within the Visible Church.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>How then? Must the promise of a new heart be here excluded? And shall nothing be meant in the Word,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What is promised, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. whether a new heart be therein promised, or exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I should judge it hard, to say, that were the only promise here made, <hi>the promise of a new heart is made to you all, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore repent and be baptized.</hi> The Antecedent is not true. 2. Therefore because <hi>Peter</hi> speaks unto, and of a mixed multitude, Fathers, Children, Elect and Reprobate, who must first understand, the promise of life and forgivenesse is made <hi>to you. Ergo,</hi> all come to age, repent and be baptized. And because the promise is made to your children, therefore let them be baptized. And 3. the promise of new heart is not to be excluded, because there were in the company to whom, and of whom the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> speaks, many Elect, in whom the old Prophesie, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. was to be fulfilled; For he saith, <hi>The promise is made to as many as the Lord shall call</hi>; to the Gentiles, it were a sense too narrow, to exclude that promise, and therefore, as the great promise, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed</hi> (which chiefly is meant, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39.) requires not the same condition in fathers and infants, nor the same condition in fathers, <hi>wives, hewers of wood, Officers and Commanders, litle ones,</hi> and such as were not born, <hi>Deu.</hi> 29. with whom the Covenant is made. For the same faith in fath is and in infants, and faith working in the same duties cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of husbands, wives, Magistrates, and hewers of wood) so neither is the promise made the same way to fathers, children, <hi>Jews near hand,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles farre off,</hi> to Elect and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How can the promise of the Covenant, to write the Law in


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58986:56"/>
the heart, be made absolutely, and not to the Reprobate, but to the Elect only? For the Elect are only these to whom that promise is made, and yet the Reprobate are really in the Covenant of Grace, and the promise is made to them, as hath been said.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is no inconvenient that the Reprobate in the Visible Church,<note place="margin">Mercies of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, are not alike and the same way promised to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, to wit. Elect and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</note> be so under the Covenant of Grace, as some promises are made to them, and some mercies promised to them conditionally, and some reserved speciall promises <hi>of a new heart,</hi> and of <hi>perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi> belong not to them. For all the promises belong not the same way, to the parties visibly and externally, and to the parties internally and personally in Covenant with God. So the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth life and forgivenesse shall be given to these who are exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the Covenant, providing they beleeve, but the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth not a new heart and grace to beleeve, to these that are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly externally in Covenant. And yet he promiseth both to the Elect.</p>
               <p>Hence the Covenant must be considered two ways, <hi>in abstracto</hi> and formally,<note place="margin">The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace is considered two ways, <hi>in abstracto, &amp; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The word tells of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or work,<note place="margin">The new heart is promised to such spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters, not to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters in general, and as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters.</note> or act to be performed by any, which if he do he shall have a new heart: and therefore the promise of the <hi>ingraven Law in the heart,</hi> is not a simple promise made to the Covenanters as Covenanters, for so it should be a promise to all visible Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters (for visible Covenanters are essentially Covenanters) but it is both a promise and a prediction, yea a reall execution or an efficacious way of fulfilling the decree of Election to such and such chosen, and specially loved of God Covenanters.</p>

For because Christ is holy as root, head and Redeemer, the Jews once his Church Visible and to be so again, the branches are not really holy by faith, because all of them were not in Christ: But if all Jews and Gentiles, and also Infants who are Jews and Gentiles and parts of the body be baptized into the visible body, so are Infants.

               <p>HEnce, the clear differences betwixt the externall visible and Nationall Covenanting of the people of old,<note place="margin">Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and internall Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> when they were brought out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt</hi>; And the internall and personall (though it may be visible also) Covenanting with God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This under the New Testament is a new Covenant, and all the old shadows are abolished<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The former is the old.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is with the <hi>house of Israel and Judah</hi> chosen persons, and so personall with single men. You shall not give a Nation, Kingdom, or Land, with which the Covenant internally is so made, as if all and every one, without exceptions, must <hi>know the Lord</hi> savingly (what may be the converted Jews case, whether the whole body of them, all and every one shall be visible, real, and personall Covenanters, as the place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. seems to say, I cannot determine) and all and every one be saved; for then must all the visible house of Israel be saved, and not the chosen only.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The visible externall Covenant was broken, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.32. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther personall and internall is never broken.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The promise of a new heart is really fulfilled, in all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and single branches of the house of <hi>Judah,</hi> so that all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one are taught of <hi>God,</hi> none excepted, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, 34. <hi>Isa.</hi> 54.13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.45. not so in the visible externall Covenant, if it be but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall: not any is taught of God, but all are taught of men.</p>

There should be no need that Christ die, except only to satisfie for our breach of the Law, not to purchase new grace to us by his merits, and such a power should be no grace of Christ. If it be a supernaturall grace merited by Christ, then have Pagans, and all the Heathen that supernaturall inherent grace to beleeve in the Son of God, and yet the object thereof, the Gospel is not revealed to them, which is an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous dispensation not warranted by the Scripture, that the Lord should give a supernaturall power, to beleeve they know not what. 2. A supernaturall power to beleeve is saving grace, and a power to love Christ, and can saving grace be in Pagans or in any, and they know not of it? 3. Yea sins of Pagans, for which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, must be the Gospel-sins, for they cannot be Law-sins, for if all mankind be under the Covenant of grace, there can none at all be under the Law: For there can be none under the Covenant of Works, and also under the Covenant of Grace, for they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair dispensations, and contrair wayes of salvation.

But so 1. that grace saving proper to the Elect by this means is in the power of all Pagans, and all must be gifted with a power to purchase that grace proper to the Elect: That must be strange conquishing, we must all be made our own efficacious Redeemers, and Christ is a Saviour by merit, not by efficacy; For if this saving grace be infused, it is

And they must say that <hi>Christ</hi> hath merited a generall ineffectuall power to some, and that he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to merit a speciall saving grace to others. Let us have a warrant for this, that <hi>Christ</hi> both died equally to save all, and yet with two contrary intentions, to purchase a power of believing which should be effectuall to some to save them, and ineffectuall to others. If it be said that <hi>Christ</hi> dyed to merite the same generall power to all, but some make it ineffectuall, some not; This saith thus. 1. That Christs death might have it's fruit and effect, though all perish. 2. That Christ dyed to merite a far off, lubrick and possible venture of heaven, such as was the case of the first <hi>Adam.</hi> 3. Christ dyed not to purchase a new heart more to one then to another, whereas 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. the blood the Lord shed is to <hi>Redeem us from our vain conversation,</hi>

If conditionally, what can be the condition going before conversion, to wit, that we should be delivered from our vain conversation, so we be willing, before our conversion, to be delivered from our vain conversation. And shall not the Question recur concerning that condition? In a word they will have Christs death to buy Heaven, but not to buy faith, without which Heaven is impossible. Yea he no more bought to men a grace sweetly and strongly inclining the will to believe, then he bought such a grace to the damned devils.<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The first Doctrine can be tryed by no other rule, because it was the first rule it self, nor can these principalls written in the heart naturally (<hi>That God is</hi>) (God is just, holy) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any other truths, because they are first truths; As the sense of seeing cannot try whether the Sun be the Sun by the light of some other Sun, that is before this Sun, which is more lightsome.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is a word immediatly spoken by the Prophets, and Apostles, that is to be tryed, partly by the first Preaching the <hi>Lord</hi> made in <hi>Paradise,</hi> partly by the effects, that it converteth the soul, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.7. and smells of that same Majesty, and the divine power of another life, which is in the first Sermon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is <hi>Verbum Dei immediatum.</hi> But when God himself speaks in his own person to <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 22. to <hi>Moses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Isaiah,</hi> the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that is <hi>Verbum Dei immediatissimum,</hi> the fountain-word; neither word nor speaker is to be tryed.

been some men, who have Prophesied facts to come, that fell out as they foretold, just as <hi>Isaiah, Elias,</hi> and other Prophets, then something is to be beleeved, that is not written, and such may have the Spirit, and yet no word of Scripture goes along with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Such men may have (I confesse) a Propheticall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but first, they were eminently holy and sound in the faith,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Prophesies that now are, and Scripturall Prophesies</note> and taught that the Catholick Church should beleeve nothing, nor practise nothing, but what is warranted by the Word. Such as boast of Spirit or Prophesie, and reject the word, are therefore not to be beleeved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What these men of God foretold, is a particular fact concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a man, what death he should die, or a Nation, or a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, such a man shall be eternally saved, but no <hi>dogma fidei,</hi> nor any truth that lays bands on the Catholick Church to believe that to the end of the world, as all Scripturall truths do, and a doubt it is, if we are to beleeve these, in the individuall circumstances of fact, <hi>sub periculo peccati,</hi> upon hazard of sinning against God, we may, I judge, without sin suspend belief, and yeeld charity to the speaker.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If any object, the Prophets did foretell particular facts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the death of <hi>Ahab,</hi> the birth of <hi>Josiah,</hi> which concerned particular persons: I, but they so were the maters of fact (as the crucifying of <hi>Christ</hi> was a mater of fact) as also they did by the intent of the Holy Ghost contain Historicall, Morall and dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally divine Instructions, so that the whole Catholick Church must believe them, with certainty of divine faith,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, of what is truth, and what is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or not lawful, and revelations of facts, what shall come to passe, and what not.</note> they being written and spoken for our Instruction, and they sin who believe not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. What are we to judge of these truths revealed to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, when they are in much nearnesse to <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi> is pleased to shine upon them in some fulness of manifestation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to their souls, especially in particular facts? <hi>Answ.</hi> There is a wide difference betwixt revelations, which speak what is lawfull or unlawfull, agreeable unto or repugnant to the Word; And what is good <hi>in jure,</hi> and what <hi>in facto,</hi> shall come to passe or not come to passe, what ever is given to revelations of the former sort, is taken from the Scripture, whose peculiar perfection it is to show

what is good and just, what not; Therefore to say that revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons now do guide us in disobeying higher Powers or killing men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a wronging of the Word, especially of the first, second and sixth Commands. As to the other, God may and doth lead his owne, especially when they are near glory, under fewest prejudices tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching time and eternity, to speak what shall be, but it is not our rule. It's an Argument of nought, <hi>Such a thing was mightily born in upon my spirit as lawfull and as certainly to come to passe, when I was most near to GOD in a full manifestation of himself: therefore such a way is right,</hi>

                  <hi>or such a way shall come to passe</hi>; For not to say 1. that this is a wronging of the perfection of Scripture, and 2. That there is a bastard Logick in the affections where God and nature hath seated discursive power; And we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten prophesie, because we love, not because we see the visions of <hi>God.</hi> 3. <hi>Peter</hi> might, the same way, reason, <hi>I saw the glory of heaven at the transfiguration, and the Peers of the higher house,</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Elias, <hi>and this was then mightily born in upon my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, It is good for us to be here, let us build three Tabernacles: therefore this is true, It is good for us to be here:</hi> But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion is a dream; who should preach the Gospel as witnesses and suffer for it,<note place="margin">

So <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 19. and <hi>cap.</hi> 22. seeth <hi>Heaven opened, and behold a white horse and him who sate on him,</hi> and he <hi>heard the voice of many, saying, Hale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah,</hi> and saw the pure river of water of life, the tree of life, the Throne, and Him that sate thereupon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he did not rightly infer that he might therefore fall down and worship a created An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel. All which saith they vainly boast of the Spirit who reject the light of Scripture, which is a surer day-star then the light of glory, for our direction. The light of glory is for our perfection of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, in seeing and enjoying the last end, but not for our instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in leading to the end, and the means.

The Adversaries, <hi>Socinians,</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> who by this Text, say we are justified by works, know no Gospel-faith, by which we are justified, but faith including essentially new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, the crucifying of the old man, the walking in the Spirit, and repentance; as else where I cite. Therefore when <hi>Iames</hi> saith we are not justified by faith only, he must mean a naked dead as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: as in the former verses; We are not justified; and that is it which we say: <hi>Iames</hi> denies not but sayes that <hi>Abraham</hi> belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.</p>

And the faith here excluded must be a dead faith, not a lively faith and a true faith, as the body without the soul is a true body and hath the nature of a true body, though it be no living body. So (say they) the faith that <hi>Iames</hi> excludes is a true faith, when as it is evident, it is no more true faith then the faith of Devils and Hypocrites. 3. It is false by the <hi>Papists</hi>

And when he gave his life for the rightfull and due possession of glory to us, we did contribute nothing either request or help to procure the title, and the grace to enter in to the possession by faith is the fruits also of free grace. Nor can it be denyed but our good works, by which we enter into possession of the Crown, are also the fruit of <hi>Christs</hi> death: but yet not so as there is any meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious or federall power of deserving the possession communicate to our works; Only they are made by Christs death the oblidged way to the possession of life.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That promise is neither a promise of the Covenant of Works, for <hi>by the deeds of the Law no flesh can be saved:</hi> Nor is it a federall promise of the Covenant of Grace, strictly so called, except any would say that it is called a promise especially for faith, which is speciall Godlinesse,<note place="margin">How the promise is made to godlinesse.</note> and the <hi>acknowledging of the truth, which is according to godlinesse,</hi> Tit. 1.1. and so a promise made to the Godly in so far as he is in Christ by faith, and in Christ is the promise of life, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.1. Nor 3. is the promise of a title and right, which is made to <hi>Christ</hi> our Ransone payer, made to our Godlinesse, as if it did buy our right to life eternall, or were the price thereof. 4. Life is promised to Believers who work, not because they work: And 5. the Lord in these only showeth the order of bringing men to glory, not the causes of the right and title to glory, except we say the mowing of the first quarter of the Meadow is the cause of the mowing of the second, because it makes way to the mowing of the second, and the mowing of the second quarter is a cause of the mowing of the third, and so forth, untill all be mown. As, because <hi>God</hi> gives grace to work, to run, to use means, therefore he giveth, of free grace, the crown of life in the possession thereof.</p>

               <p>IT may appear that Christ suffered not for any sin which is onely against the Gospel, such as finall unbeleef: <hi>If any sins be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in any other respect as against the Gospel only, then Christ was not to suffer for any such sin so considered, for where no death is threatened, none is explicitely due, and where it is not so due to the sinner, nor should have been execute upon him, there it could not have been due to Christ nor executed upon him, For the Gospel threateneth not death to any sin, but finall unbeleef and rebellion (and for that Christ never died) therefore Christ died not for any sin as against the Gospel, nor suffered that which is no where threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened.</hi> But this is most doubtsome and cannot well stand. Its true that <hi>Christ suffered not for finall unbeleef,</hi> it being the proper sin of some reprobates, to wit, of such as hear the Gospel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.21, 24. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.7, 8. But it seems against all Scripture that Christ should die for these, for whose sins he dies not: And so that 1. Christ should half and part the sins of the Reprobate, and the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, I judge shall not admit that <hi>Christ bare in his own body, on the tree,</hi> some sins of the Reprobate, to wit, all their sins against the Law, <hi>absolutely,</hi> or <hi>conditionally,</hi> and he that bears not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>absolutely,</hi> or <hi>conditionally</hi> their other sins against the Gospel,

to wit,<note place="margin">Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not for some sins of reprobates, and not for others.</note> their finall unbeleef and rebellion, for Christ was wounded and bruised for the transgressions and iniquities of these for whom he died; He must then have been wounded for some of their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, and not wounded for other of their transgressions. And so the sins of the Reprobates, are divided between Christs satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon the Crosse, and their own satisfaction in Hell: But he suffered (one may say) <hi>conditionally</hi> only for the Reprobates sins against the Law upon the Crosse, if they beleeve, not otherwise? <hi>Ans.</hi> The same reall satisfaction conditionally that he performed on the Crosse, for the Elect, the same (say the Authors) he performed for the Reprobate, <hi>conditionally,</hi> if either beleeve, but because the one beleeves, it is accepted for payment for them, and the other beleeves not, it is not accepted for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As there is a satisfaction performed for some sins, not for all, not for finall unbeleef, that sin then must be in the same case with the sin of the fallen <hi>Angels,</hi> there is no sacrifice for it, nor is Christs death applicable by divine ordination to purge men from finall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleef more then to purge Devils from any sins they commit. 3.

Is there no call of <hi>God</hi> now required for spreading of the Gospel? Some Nations would kill them, some would persecute Christians to death and not receive them: in the mean time, many for whom Christ died, perish. 3.

                  <hi>Quest.</hi> WHat is the speciall difference of the promise of the two Covenants?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is known that only life eternall is promised in the Law, if a right to the things of this life was promised to <hi>Adam,</hi> it is like he behoved to compleat his course of obedience, and merit a right legall to the herbs and fruit of the earth, beside the right he had by gift of Creation, <hi>ex dono Creatoris, non jure operum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 2. There was no promise made to <hi>Adam</hi> of perseverance, and so no promise made to him of influences to work in <hi>Adam</hi> to will and to do; so the influences by which he obeyed was, <hi>purum donum Creatoris,</hi> a meer gift of the Creator, not a gift of either the grace of <hi>Christ,</hi> or a promised grace, though in a large sense, it may be called a grace, or <hi>donum gratis datum:</hi> For <hi>God</hi> gave that influence upon no obligation. Now that it was not a grace promised is evident by <hi>Adams</hi> fall: for <hi>God,</hi> who is true, fulfills his promises. 2. <hi>Augustine</hi> and our Divines teach, <hi>Dedit Deus posse ut vellet, non velle ut posset,</hi> a power to stand, but not the gift of actuall perseverance. If any say that the <hi>Lord</hi> promised to <hi>Adam</hi> perseverance conditionally (which in one sense is true, in another false) if he pleased, in that he gave to him all necessaries required for actuall standing. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This is to teach that perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance was promised the same way, in the Covenant of Works, that <hi>Arminius</hi> saith it is promised in the Covenant of Grace, and that the free-will was absolute lord of standing and falling, and to deny <hi>God</hi> to be the nearest cause of our standing and persevering in either, the one or the other, and to bid us first and last sacrifice to our own free-will. 2. Willing perseverance actuall cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised conditionally:<note place="margin">Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance was not promised to <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </note> for the question should be, Upon what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition doth the <hi>Lord</hi> promise to work in <hi>Adam</hi> actual perseverance, if he should be willing to persevere? But the question shall remain, whether that willingnesse to persevere, since it is the greatest part, if not whole perseverance, be promised or not; If it be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,


<pb n="195" facs="tcp:58986:107"/>
the contrair whereof they hold, if it be promised conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the question shall recur, what shall be the condition, and another condition then the willingnesse of the will to persevere cannot be given, and so the argument shall rise against it self, and the issue must be, <hi>God</hi> gave to <hi>Adam</hi> actuall perseverance, if he should be willing to persevere, that is, he gives to <hi>Adam</hi> perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, if he give him perseverance; for willingnesse to persevere is perseverance, or a very large part thereof.</p>

As to the former, saving faith is of that nature that it is apt to endure, it hath a sort of immortality, so the promise <hi>in titulo &amp; jure,</hi> is made to that faith only which is of that nature that it must endure to the end, and the promise of life and remission is not made to a saving faith under the accident of enduring to the end, or for the years, suppon thirty or fourty years, or eight hundred years, or above, that <hi>Adam</hi> or the Patriarchs lived in the state of beleeving, for a faith of some hours only shall save the repenting thief as well as a faith of many years. And 2. life eternall in the possession is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised and given only to the faith that continues to the end, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the duration because a longer enduring faith hath merit,


<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58986:113"/>
but that is by accident, in regard of the right to life and because God hath commanded persevering in faith, life is given only in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session to such a faith as endures, but we cannot say that the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall endurance and existence of faith for so many years doth save and justifie, as the living so many years makes a Child an heir to a great estate, for his being born the eldest son, makes him his fathers heir.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is a twofold imputation, one legall, another which for Doctrines cause we call application or reall (though the legall imputation be also reall; but not to us as the former) the Lords <hi>act of laying the iniquity of us all upon Christ,</hi> Isa. 53.6. and the Lords making <hi>him sin for us,</hi> that is a sacrifice for sin, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. evinces necessarily the truth of this, the former imputation. For 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.</hi> If it be expounded of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall reconciliation of persons, it may say something, for the other imputation, but the other imputation is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Abraham beleeved God, and it was counted to him for righteousnesse,</hi> v. 7. <hi>Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered,</hi> v. 8. <hi>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not sin,</hi> v. 9. <hi>Faith</hi> (that is, that which faith beleeved, as hope is put for the thing hoped for, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24. <hi>was imputed to</hi> Abraham <hi>for righteousnesse,</hi> though <hi>Gomarus</hi> give another exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wit, that by faith or the act of beleeving we obtain this to


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58986:114"/>
be reputed righteous, and it suits better with the Text. And as to the former imputation, <hi>God</hi> could not in justice wound Christ for our transgressions, nor bruise him for our iniquities, nor could the Lord break him, nor <hi>deliver him to the death for us all,</hi> except God had both made him the sinner, that is, imputed and reckoned him the sinner in Law (for intrinsecally and inherently he was not the sinner but <hi>holy, harmlesse,</hi> &amp;c.) and laid our debts upon him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.6. and except he had been willing to have been coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the sinner, and had said (<hi>thou hast given me a body, here am I, to do thy will,</hi> Psal. 40.7. Heb. 10.6, 7.) this reckoning of Christ to be the sinner is not only in the eternall decree, but also a laying of our iniquities upon him in time, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.6. or a dealing with him in Law in punishing him as the sinner. And 2. by using the humane nature as an instrument of our Redemption on the Crosse. <hi>Antinomians</hi> take this imputing of our sins to Christ,<note place="margin">The mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians</hi>

                  </note> and recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Christ to be the sinner, to be the justifying of the sinner, which is a grosse mistake; for so without beleeving all that Christ died for should be justified upon the Crosse. But the Scripture is so far from ascribing Justification to any but to a beleever, that it saith <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was imputed to him for righteousnesse. Now the faith of multitudes for whom Christ died when he suffered on the Crosse, is a very nothing: Many are not born, and a nothing or a <hi>non ens</hi> cannot be counted for righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>It is to be observed that payment made by the surety absolveth the debter, so as the Law, except it be the generall Law of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, requireth no act of love, of faith, of service from the debter, nor doth the Law of suretyship in its essence and nature require that the Creditor, <hi>&amp; sub eo titulo</hi> should pay the homage of faith,<note place="margin">

                  </note> indeed when the Creditor is both the Creditor and the offended Party, and also the supream Law-giver GOD, he may require of the captives the obedience of faith.

Now except the meaning had been, we are not under the Law, that is, the Laws dominion and the Laws condemning power, there had been no place for such an Objection, nay, nor any shadow; but the true Objection is, we are not under the Law to be thereby condemned and eternally punished, therefore what is the hazard of sin?

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Covenant of Grace is eternall, in regard in it there is promised actuall grace, and continuall influences of grace from the Head <hi>Christ,</hi> the High Priest, to keep the confederats in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and in perseverence to the end. And no such influences either for the habit of grace or for the continuated acts thereof, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in the Covenant of Works, in regard <hi>Adam</hi> a man, and poor men in him do undertake to obey. Whereas Christ-Man binds and undertakes as head Covenanter and Surety for all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der confederats, and for sinners in the Covenant of Grace. Which difference is much to be observed, between the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace: And for that cause the Covenant of Works is, 1. more independent, and requires more of mans strength and less grace then the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It stands more by precepts, lesse by promises, having only one promise of a reward and hyre to the obeyer, and consists all of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, the other though it want not precepts, especially, it is his command that we believe in the Son of <hi>God,</hi> yet stands most by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and this Covenant gets the name of a promise or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 3.25. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:58986:119"/>3.

               <p n="4">4. The Covenant of Grace is, thus, also eternall, in that the buried and dead parties <hi>Abraham,</hi>

alway, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14. and fears and trembles <hi>at the Lord and his goodnesse,</hi> Hos. 3.5. A Godly heart trembles more for fear of grace and the debt of grace, then of justice and wrath; and fears sin more, as it is against the bands of grace, and against Christ, and Gospel-love who can save, then as it is against Law the Law-giver, and him who eternally destroyes. And so the aw of heaven hath a stronger impression then the terrour and aw of hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. How can the fear of falling away, and the faith of perseverance absolutely promised and absolutely given, consist to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How fear of law-fear acts upon a beleever.</note>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Law-fear of falling away, and the Gospel faith of persevering are not consistent. The fear legall of the least sinne is a fear of hell and of eternall wrath to be irrecoverably inflicted, but because the person is under grace, the beleever cannot fear this fear, except the Law-fear be letten out against him as a temptation, but it is not his oblidged duty so to fear.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Law-fear upon a beleever is conditionall, and not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, as he fears hell and falling away, <hi>jure,</hi> as his deserving, if <hi>God</hi> should enter in judgement with him, and if he were not in CHRIST: But he is oblidged to a Gospel-faith which layes hold on Christ, righteousnesse, and deliverance from condemnation, and if <hi>Christ</hi> and interest in him be hid from him, and nothing on but Law-fear, that is a triall, not a duty of Law-fear. <note n="*" place="margin">So the faith of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> &amp; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> their Son <hi>shal be great shal sit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Thron. of</hi> DAVID <hi>his father &amp; shal raign o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the house of Jacob for ever,</hi> Luk. 1.32, 33. did wel consist with that holy and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedientiall fear of <hi>flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> for fear that <hi>Herod</hi> shuld mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that hopefull young <hi>King</hi> in his cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 2.</note> But there is a Godly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Law-fear, or a Gospel-Law-fear, which is a Godly horrour conditionall for that which is never to be inflicted, but yet according to deserving may be inflicted, and this is the terrour of the Lord, which breedeth Gospel perswasion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. and so may well stand with Gospel-faith and assurance of deliverance from falling away and of being stablished and confirmed to the end. As a child in the fathers arm threatened to be cast over a sharp Rock in the Sea, may have horrour and fear, and cry out for fear, and yet beleeve so his fathers compassion as he will not throw him in the Sea, because the threatning is ordained not to be exercised, but that the child may so much the more thrust his arms about his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers neck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. What is the best victory over temptations from such fears?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:58986:120"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> As in all temptations, so here,<note place="margin">What is to be done under ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> overcoming is attended with precious promises, which are to be read, <hi>Rev. c.</hi> 2.7.17.26, 27, 28. <hi>c.</hi> 3.5.12.21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>For 1. Feavers of the Law that have no kindly cools, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting by the promises of the Gospel, tend not to the strengthning of the life of <hi>God,</hi> but only when they leave a standing self loathing, and loving of Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It argues the strength of faith, after many, yea six foyles to stand; as the Army that is broken six times, yet rallies and draws up again, is often at the seventh time victorious.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such as stand against a strong and mighty tentation, <hi>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

But wee had the sentence of death in our selves,</hi> do prevail to the being taught of <hi>God, not to trust in our selves, but in God who quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the dead</hi>: For here there comes reall strength from fighting: As he who, by strength of nature, lives and convalesceth after a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning boatch and strong pestilence, goes through pest-houses and is never infected again. So the worthies by faith who overcame strong temptations, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. to the end, keep the fields and prevail till death.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Godly fear of self-weaknesse and trembling at sin which may darken the feelings of received mercies and sweet influences addeth strength. Something of that is here, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. <hi>when I am weak, then am I strong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. A fixed peace in assurance of deliverance from condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and quietnesse in beleeving pardon and righteousnesse in <hi>Christ,</hi> ought alwayes to be, as touching the state of Justification: for the questioning of this in a beleever, if <hi>Antinomians</hi> will yeeld to truth, is contrair to faith, and no warrantable assurance.

Indeed the complaining of want of justification and of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of God in a believer, and a raising of the foundation, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 31.22. <hi>Jonah</hi> 2.4. <hi>I am cast out of thy sight:</hi> are both false and bastard-feelings, and hastie unbelief: for this is a reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a reproaching of the Office of the Healer of sinners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is contrair to faith, and the former is a complaining of the body of sin that can hardly be sclandered; so a complaining of self, and the feeling of inherent corruption weakens not, but strengthens faith.

Then every feeling of sin is not contrair to faith, as Mr. <hi>Town</hi> and other <hi>Antinomians</hi> teach, some godly tender feeling foments faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 6. How cometh it to passe that seldome feeling of sin wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth unbeleef?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Our looking, in a Legall, not in an Evangelick way, upon sin,<note place="margin">Why feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of sin, seldome wants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleef.</note> doth occasion unbelief: for looking to the sicknesse of the sinner is but abused, when this use is made of it, that the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion which <hi>Christ</hi> hath aboundantly answered; Ah he hath not, who satisfied and payed my ransome, justified me also by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in him: but the strong body of sin which leads me captive, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. doth also lead, rather mislead me to doubt whether the ransome was sufficiently payed, and I sufficiently and freely, by his grace and the <hi>Redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</hi> justified, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. And because the sinner feels the stirring and too vigorous acting of a body of sin, which is his own work, he removes the foundation-stones laid by <hi>Christ,</hi> and questions the well done work of <hi>Christ,</hi> and thrusts in his sickle into Christs har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest:


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:58986:121"/>
which is upon the mater to say, Ah my sanctification is nought or small: Therefore Christs satisfaction is weak, so the man,<note place="margin">Ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when the believer complains of his own sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because of guiltines lately act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he also unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of <hi>Christ</hi> his performed satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as if it were weak.</note> laying the burden upon the wrong back, will take and pull off the burden that <hi>Christ</hi> in <hi>his own body did bear on the tree,</hi> as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. and wrestle under his own body of sin himself, and he thinks he will do the busines better himself then <hi>Christ.</hi> This is that which <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> imput to us groundlesly, but it is our sinfull weaknesse so to be troubled at the indwelling of a body of sin, as we doubt of and call in question the work of Justification and the satisfaction of Christ. But there is good cause why the sinner quarrel with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and complain of a body of sin, and yet not only quarrell with Christ, but exalt Christ, and by faith close with the absolutenesse of his gifted satisfaction and righteousnesse. And this is as easie by the Grace of God, as we see the more that a gracious soul abases himself, as one <hi>carnall and sold under sin,</hi> Rom. 7.14. as one in whom there <hi>dwells no good,</hi> as touching the flesh, <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>in whom sin dwells, v.</hi> 20. as one <hi>brought into captivity to the Law of sin,</hi> and a <hi>wretched man,</hi> 24. so much the more doth he exalt Christ the only deliverer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 23, 33, 34, 35. and why should not our blacknesse commend Christs beauty, our deadness exalt his life, our sinfull wretchednesse his glorious office in saving, and our emptinesse and drynesse his fulnesse of the anointing who is all fulnesse?</p>

And in some it is the naturall conscience accusing and challenging after sin is committed; now CHRIST came not to extirpate conscience, nor the power of feeling and discerning the obligation to wrath, that the conscience apprehendeth after sin is committed, nor the legall evill deserving of sin, nor the contrariety between it and the Law. 2. Christ by his death gives repentance and mourning for sin, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. <hi>Eze.</hi> 12.10, 11. (3.) Christ commends this, Jer. 31.18. <hi>I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself.</hi> 2 King. 22.19. <hi>Because thine heart was tender — and thou hast weept before me, I have also heard thee, saith the Lord.</hi> Luk. 7.44. <hi>She hath washed my feet with tears.</hi> (4.)

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What place hath Christs righteousnesse here?</p>

               <p>Now the active obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of <hi>Christ</hi> falls under a twofold considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 1.

The whole course of Christs obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from his birth to the grave, by doing and suffering, is to be considered as the doing and suffering of so excellent a person, his being born, his praying, preaching, dying, coming from a <hi>Person God-Man.</hi> Now the Law required not praying, preaching of

God-man, the blood of God, or the dying of him who was God-Man. And so all these being both <hi>so excellent,</hi> and then so <hi>undue,</hi> have respect of satisfaction to <hi>God.</hi> 2.

                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:58986:126"/>As touching our right to God as incarnate. 2. As dying for us.<note place="margin">Christs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation and death cannot be a fruit of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors death.</note> 3. As his satisfaction is made ours, are of diverse considerations. For if <hi>God</hi> out of free love sent his Son in the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. and if he, out of free-grace that separateth the race of man from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, took upon him the nature of man, to wit, of <hi>Abraham, and not the nature of Angels,</hi> Heb. 2.16. Then sure by the merits of Christs death it cannot come that God came in the flesh to save sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. For the effect cannot but come from the cause; but the cause flowes not from the effect, nor is the effect, to wit, Christs Incarnation and his dying, the cause of that love and free-grace of God which moved God to send his Son in the flesh, but posterior un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and latter then that love: for because he loved us, he sent his Son in the flesh to die for us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This cannot then be true (<hi>Christ by his dying for the Elect, merited and deserved, that God should be made Man for us</hi>) for this should be true also (<hi>by the blood of Christ, and by the redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption that is in Christ, God sent his Son in the flesh, and the Son took on him our nature, by the blood of the Covenant</hi>) nor can this be true <hi>(Christ merited by his death, that he should die for us)</hi> for so it should be true, that Christ by his blood shed his blood for us: Where as because he loved his Church freely, he gave himself for her. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Who loved me and gave himself for me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. Hence 1. though grace be the cause of grace, as because he of grace ordained us to glory, therefore of grace he calls, and because of free-grace he calls, of free-grace he carries on his work, and gives of grace, perseverance and glory. Yet there is a fountain-grace of election to glory, which hath no cause nor merit, not the merit of Christ for its cause; but is the cause of causes and of Christs merits. As one fire may produce another, but the element of fire was not produced by another element of fire, but by God in creation. And one Vine Tree brings forth another, but the first Vine Tree was created by the Lord only.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Conclus.</hi> Nor have we (to speak acurately) right to Christs satisfaction nor to his righteousnesse by faith.<note place="margin">We have not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly right to Christs sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction by faith.</note> 1.

                  </gap> Christs death to the Reprobate, or no such thing is merited. If neither be procured by Christs merite, the Patrons of this way shall say there is no serious offer made to them: yea there is a <hi>jus,</hi> a title to life eternall and remission, which all the reprobate may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,


<pb n="233" facs="tcp:58986:127"/>
even a right to remission and life eternall, so they beleeve. Well then, it is the same right conditional to life and pardon which is purchased to the Elect: yea this must be purchased whether they believe or not. Then there is no more in the kind of the Law-right to Redemption and life eternall and remission of sins purchased to <hi>Peter,</hi> then to <hi>Judas</hi> or <hi>Cain</hi>; And therefore hath <hi>Christ</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed as much tender love in dying for the Reprobate as in dying for his friends. And <hi>Christ</hi> saith there is no greater love then this, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.13. As for the efficacious intention of applying of <hi>Christs</hi> death to <hi>Peter,</hi> when as <hi>God</hi> had no such intention of applying it to <hi>Judas,</hi> that is an act of eternall predestination, not a fruit of Christs death, and as for the grace of beleeving, it was purchased to all, Reprobate and Elect, only the Lord applyes not his death, and bestowes not the grace of beleeving upon the Reprobate, but for right to faith, to remission, to perseverance, to life eternall, this right must be purchased, but faith it self is never bestowed upon them. But there is a ransome of blood given for faith, and purchased by CHRISTS merit: But CHRIST is never called the Head of all men, Elect and Reprobate, <hi>but the Head of the Body the Church,</hi> Eph. 1.22. Col. 1.18. And whereas the Head hath merited faith to the Reprobate, and that absolutely (for a condition is not possible) he should bestow it absolutely, else there is no seriousnesse in the command of beleeving. And since faith is no meritorious cause of right to remission and life eternall, nor a cause in part, or in whole, of our compleat and actuall reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it may well be said, that they all are compleatly reconciled, pardoned, justified, washen in Christs blood, when nothing is wanting, that compleats the nature of remission and justification, for faith is only a condition applying, not a cause buying, nor sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying for us, and no cause giving in part, or in whole, any new right.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> How we sinned in <hi>Adam</hi> is a point of greater difficulty: For this first sin the tottering and reeling of the specifick common nature in <hi>Adam</hi> is ours,<note place="margin">

There be three parts of Originall sin: A partaking of the first sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> we all sinned in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, 14, 15. (2.) The want of the Image of God, called the Glory of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. (3.) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence and a bentnesse of nature to sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7, 14, 17, 18, 23, 24. As to the first, <hi>Adams</hi> sin is ours really and truely, not so much because it is ours,<note place="margin">Three parts of original sin.</note> as because it is imputed to be ours by <hi>God,</hi> who so contrived the Law of Works, as it should be made with <hi>Adam,</hi> not as a single father, but with <hi>Adam</hi> as a publick person represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all man, and having our common nature as a father both by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Law, which came from the meer free-will of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">(2.) But children are as naturally in their nearest fathers loines, as we are all in the loines of <hi>Adam,</hi> and all men are equally of that same specifick nature with their nearest Parents, as with their first Parents: Yet the sins of the nearest Parents, by no necessity, are alwayes charged upon the children, but now all have sinned in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> Rom. 5.12, 18.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Where a sin is inherently and personally, there is no need of imputation, which is a free Act of God, had Christ been inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently

and personally the sinner, God needed not make him, or impute our sins to him: as <hi>Isai.</hi> 53.6, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. and if we had been intrinsecally sinners in <hi>Adam,</hi> his sin had been ours as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecally as it was <hi>Adams</hi>; and as <hi>Adam</hi> was not the first who sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by imputation, but personally and intrinsecally, so neither should <hi>Adams</hi> sin have been our sin by imputation, but intrinsecal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and personally, now the Scripture saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>By one mans disobedience, many were made sinners,</hi>

And <hi>Christ</hi> hath <hi>verè &amp; propriè,</hi> truelie and properly died for them. Nor 4. is it enough to say that Christ had a speciall intention in dying for the Elect to give them faith, but he had no such intention in dying for the Reprobate. But hence it follows that <hi>Christ</hi> as properly and truely died for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate as for the Elect, as touching the nature and intention of his dying; and that he offered as sufficient a ransome for the one as for the other, and that is a meer possible ransome, but as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the intention to apply effectually, or no effectuall intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to apply the death, there's the difference.

It is not enough to coyn two intentions in <hi>Christ-God-Man</hi> dying, and give us Scripture for one of them only, and bid us take the other on trust. 2. Nor is it enough to say all these places speak of Christs effectuall dying for his Elect only. For 1. it is not truely nor properly said that Christ effectually died for the Elect only, for he effectually died for no man by this way, because he died only to make salvation possible to all, so as they might perish for ever, notwithstanding of his dying for them: So the efficacy of dying is in Christs intention, and application. Now efficacy of intention and efficacy of appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation are both extrinsecall to his laying down his life. 2. The place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. cannot be expounded by them of only the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: For it speaks (as they expone it) of <hi>Christ</hi> dying for all <hi>that were dead,</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 14. and these they say are Elect and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.

This would say that the Reprobate were to beleeve that <hi>Christ</hi> died to save them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving purchased life to them, and to believe that he died not to save them all for whom he died, because they are not to believe he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to purchase faith by his death, or grace to beleeve, without which salvation is impossible: it cannot be said that <hi>God</hi> absolutely intended to save them, whether they beleeve or not, even while as there is such a decree in <hi>God,</hi> because he hath decreed both the end and the means, to wit, having ordained for them salvation, and having ordained for them faith; nor is there any such decree in God, toward any but the Elect only, therefore this conditionall decree (if all and every one beleeve, all and every one shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) can infer no love of <hi>God</hi> through <hi>Christ</hi> to the persons of all and every one to have them saved, more then this can infer a love of saving all and every one, to be in God or to have been in the Lord, before the fall of <hi>Angels,</hi> and men (if all and every one of

                  <hi>Angels</hi> and men shall perfectly, without sin to the end, keep the Law, then all Angels, all men Elect and Reprobate shall be saved eternally.) Now no man found in judgement, can say this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall can infer that <hi>God</hi> had a good will to save some Angels, not to save others: More then this (if all and every man beleeve in Christ they shall be saved) can infer that <hi>God</hi> hath a good-will to save Reprobate men, and not fallen Angels. In a word, no simple conditionall propositions can infer the desire or good will of God to the persons of men or to have the things done, except God effectually work the condition: As this <hi>(if all fulfill the Law perfectly, men and Angels, and all men shall be saved by the Law)</hi> cannot infer that <hi>God</hi> hath a good will to the persons of all Angels and all men to justifie and save them all, without exception, by the works of the Law; the contrair whereof he decreed. For this connex proposition may stand true with the salvation of all Angels, of all men, of no Angels, or no men, according as the Lord shall be pleased of his good pleasure and free grace to work, or not to work the condition of moving the will of Angels and men to keep the Law.

If it be his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and revealed will that the Gospel be Preached to all Nations, every age, they grievously sin, who Preach not the Gospel to the <hi>Brasilians</hi> and <hi>Antipods,</hi> whether they can speak in their Language or not. And if the Doctrine of the Covenant of its own nature may so be Preached to all Nations, without exception, in every difference of time, then must all the Nations of the earth, in all differences of time, be in a capacity to be a Covenanted people of God, the Church of Christ, the Vineyard of the Lord, his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, the Spouse of Christ, his Body, his Called, and Chosen flock. For to have the Doctrine of the Covenant fixedly Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Nation, and Christ offered to them, is to be the planted Vineyard of the Lord, for to Preach to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> fixedly, they willingly hearing, is indeed the Lords entering in Covenant with <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and his choising them to be his confederate people, and the Lords planting a Vineyard, and building a Wine-presse in it, and setting up a Ministry therein; and therefore the Lord was not in Covenant with them before. Indeed to Preach the Word simply to scoffers who reject it, and that occasionally in the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, so as there is no sort of accepting of the Covenant nor any fixed Ministry there, is not a renewing of the Covenant with them, nor does it presuppose a Covenant before made with them. 2. It


<pb n="246" facs="tcp:58986:134"/>
is against the wisdome of God, that 1. there should be such a band of love the greatest love that ever was, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.13. lying upon all mankind, <hi>Brasilians, Americans,</hi> binding them to thankfull Gospel-obedience that Christ died for them, yet this obligation of the greatest love is neither written in their heart, as the Law of nature, nor is it ever revealed to them that they are under so much love by Covenant. 2. How can the Lord say I choosed you, O Israel, among all the people of the earth, and entred in Covenant with you and your seed only. For 1. there is no need of a new e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishing of the conditionall Gospel-Covenant, for it was establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with Israel, and with all the world before he choosed or called them. 2. He cannot be said to enter in Covenant with them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For all the world ever was thus Covenanted with God. 3. All the world must be an invisible Covenanted Church, and the fit matter to be a Church. For the Evangel may be Preached <hi>est de se annunciabile,</hi> not to stones and to rocks, but to all Nations, <hi>quovis seculo.</hi> 4. Since the Preaching of the Gospel to some Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and not to others, is an act of the Soveraign pleasure, yea and of the free grace of God to such as this Sun-light graciously doth visit, by this way, the sinfull neglect of such as refuse to Preach shall be the cause of the perishing of the elect, a dream.</p>

                  <hi>Socinus, Crellius,</hi> the <hi>Raccovian Catechism, Arminius,</hi> contend that Christ died for all <hi>finaliter,</hi> for to procure good and salvation to all, so they beleeve, and yet through their own fault, they may haply never be saved: not that he satisfied for us, but died for example as a Martyr (say <hi>Socinians</hi>) as <hi>Paul</hi> suffered for the Church, so as we, beleeving in Christ as in the only chief Martyr and witnesse, who as the only Author declared the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, not as a sufferer and ransom-payer who redeemed us from the Law, are saved. And as <hi>Arminians,</hi> he died for our good, not that he died in our room and stead, so as the sins of the Elect were actually taken off them and translated upon Christ, so as wee are actually freed from the punishment of sin, as if we had substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Saviour our selves, and payed our debt our selves to God; and so according to the rigour of Justice, we might crave by the Law of buying and selling deliverance from punishment, and life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall from God. But this way they will not have Christ to die in the place and room of any, but only for their good, so as they may die eternally themselves for whom <hi>Christ</hi> died. Hence 1. It follows that Christ died for them but gave no ransome of blood for them for whom he died. 2. <hi>Arminians</hi> will not have the sins and punishment satisfactory to justice (for of such punishment we speak) actually upon <hi>Christ,</hi> and translated off the sinner and laid


<pb n="248" facs="tcp:58986:135"/>
upon <hi>Christ</hi> and beleevers actually freed from satisfactory punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So that both beleevers and <hi>Christ</hi> must actually bear the satisfactory punishment. Which indeed makes beleevers half re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers with Christ: against which we disputed before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Arminians</hi> denies that we payed our debts to God, in Christ paying them for us. So that the broken man cannot be said to have satisfied the debt in, and through the surety who satisfied for him, which in all Law is unjust. And since <hi>Arminians</hi> denies that we payed to Justice a ransome for sin, because our Surety Christ payed for us, he must deny that <hi>Christ was wounded for our transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and bruised for our iniquities,</hi> or that <hi>the chastisement of our peace was upon him</hi>: Contrair to <hi>Isai.</hi> 53.5. because we made him not our Mediatour and Surety, but God made him Mediatour, and laid our iniquities upon him, <hi>Isai.</hi> 53.6. But it is accidentall in Law that the debter substitute the surety,<note place="margin">One may in Law, be a real and true satis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fying sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thogh the debter neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, nor Covenant with him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, yea though he know no, thing of the sureties willingness to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and so <hi>Christ</hi> is our surety.</note> or request him to take the place of surety upon him. But he is a reall and a most legall sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who not requested, of free grace becomes surety and pays the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same summe <hi>in speciè,</hi> in kind, that the debter ought to pay; this reason does prove he is both a surety and a gracious surety. As a Kings son who comes in and layes down his head for a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, truely and really dyeth and layeth down his life in the room and place of that malefactor, though there was no Covenant nor paction between him and the Kings son, though neither the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, nor any friend in his name did request the Prince to become surety and die for him. <hi>Reuben</hi> offers his two sons to <hi>Jacob</hi> as pawnds to be slain, if he should not bring home <hi>Benjamin</hi> safe to the father: And had <hi>Jacob</hi> accepted of the offer, <hi>Reubens</hi> two sons who knew not of the bargain, had been sureties for <hi>Benjamin,</hi> Gen. 42.37. and <hi>Judah</hi> might have been Law-surety for <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> though <hi>Benjamin</hi> requested him not to take any such place. The Lord the Creditour and Christ the Cautioner did strike hands together: Christ put himself in our room, as an hostage, pledge and surety to die for us, and payed the first and second death, the summe that we was owing, according to a paction between the Lord and Christ, and we requested not <hi>Christ</hi> to be surety, only by beleeving, we thank him, and subscribe and say Amen to what is done. But in Law we payed, in regard the same

nature that suffered was ours, and accepted as ours. But <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> clearly refuse that <hi>Christ</hi> shall be an hostage and surety for us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arminius</hi> sides with <hi>Socinus.</hi>
                  </note> because the offended party of his own furnished not one that died for him; and so he strikes at the root of a reall sacrifice that is satisfactory to <hi>God,</hi> because one and the same cannot be both satisfied, and, <hi>de suo,</hi> of his own, furnish a satisfying surety. For so as his own, <hi>Socinus</hi> saith, one cannot be both a satisfier and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son satisfied, and this is no satisfaction at all, saith <hi>Socinus.</hi> (4.) Our beleeving cannot effectuate this, that <hi>Christ</hi> hath actually born the satisfactory punishment due to us. <hi>Arminius</hi> saith that Christ hath not, <hi>actu ipso,</hi> actually born that punishment: he must say he hath born it only potentially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>potentià.</hi> Then its like when we beleeve, he bears that punishment compleatly, but he cannot die nor suffer, but once; only he must mean that Christ did actually bear our sins, but the satisfactory punishment is not accepted as suffered in our name. But our beleeving hindereth not,<note place="margin">How wee satisfied ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in CHRISTS dying, so that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p n="2">2. He could not suffer the same pain in number, that we should have suffered, for one and the same accident cannot be in different subjects, nor is the surety to pay the very same summe <hi>numero,</hi> that the debter borrowed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord could not but have punished the Elect with hating &amp; aversion of mind, they being intrinsecally and inherently sinners. He punished Christ, who was not inherently, but only by imputation the sinner, with no hatred at all, but with anger and desire of shewing and exercising revenging justice, but still loving him dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as his only Son. But upon this account, <hi>Christ</hi> must stand in our room, and because of the five-fold onenesse and Law-identity and samenesse. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though physically the surety and the debter be two different men, yet in Law they are one and the same person,<note place="margin">A fivefold onenes &amp; law identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes betwee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Christ</hi> the surety, and sinners for whom he satisfied.</note> and one and the same legall party, and the same object of justice. Whoso pursues in Law the surety, does also pursue the debter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The debt and summe is one, not two debts, nor two ransoms, nor two punishments, nor two lives to losse, but one.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is one and the same solution and satisfaction, there can not in Law-justice, come another reckoning, dying, and payment ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after the surety hath payed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is one and the same acceptation upon the creditor his part, if he accept of satisfaction in the payment made by the sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he cannot but legally accept of the debter, and cannot pursue him in Law, but must look upon him as no debter. To justifie him is another thing: It being a forinsecall transient declaration of his righteousnesse who beleeves. I speak here of an acception of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to hurt justice revenging sin, not of an acceptation of obedience.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Its one and the same legall effect, <hi>Christ</hi> justified in the Spirit, and risen again, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 3.16. and we in him as in the mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. He who being made under the Law, payed that Law-debt of satisfaction, which the Elect in their persons should have payed, and thereby freed them from the Law-debt of satisfaction: He sustained the person of the Elect in his suffering. But <hi>Christ</hi> being made under the Law, payed that Law-debt of satisfaction, which the Elect in their persons should have payed. The proposition is out of doubt, none denies the Minor, but that we should have died eternally in our persons, if Christ had not died for us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He who of purpose took on him our nature, the nature and seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the legall condition of a surety to suffer for us, he stood in our person and room in suffering for us. But Christ took on him our nature, which is common to beleeving Jews, and to such also who are casten off of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3, 4. but not as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them, but as the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Heb. 2.16.</p>
               <p>And 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>For as many as are of the works of the Law, are under the curse,</hi>

But, ver. 14. <hi>That the blessing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come on the Gentiles through Iesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith.</hi> Not that we might beleeve or not beleeve, if we would, that is not the blessing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Act. 11.18.

                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:58986:137"/>6. And it is thus confirmed, Christ in dying is not looked on as a man; Nor 2. simply as a single man dying; Nor 3. as a publick Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr or witnesse that all, or none at all, if they so will, may get good of him, but by speciall paction, if he shall lay down his life, and work his work, and suffer for our sins, that which we should have suffered, he shall receive his wages and see his seed.</p>

Yet I desire to beleeve that <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. <hi>his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree.</hi> And that <hi>he was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities,</hi> who now live, <hi>Isai.</hi> 53.5. and they cannot deny this, who teach that CHRIST died for the sins of the world, none excepted.

in satisfying and answering by his death all the demands of the Law, there is none but Christ, when the Law demands blood and the torments of the second death, can plead any thing on the contrair. Rom. 3.19. <hi>We know that what things soever the Law speaks, it speaks to these that are under the Law</hi>: but the Law speaks not then to a beleever, for he is under grace, and so is not in tearms of treating or parleying with the Law. Christ was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and the beleever is <hi>legally</hi> crucified with Christ, buried and risen again with Christ. 1. Then the Law is not his judge, it spake to Christ and condemned him and put him to death, when he was under the Law, and condemned you in him, now you say, Christ is not condemned and crucified, when ye enter in a new treatie with the Law to receive a new sentence from it, and thus ye undoe what Christ hath perfectly done. 2. To hearken to conscience compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and making another paction with the Law then Christ hath made, is to take the plea that Christ hath embarked in, off his hand; ye are to stand still and be silent, and beleeve that Christs dying, and your dying in him, is a closing of a satisfactory bargain with the Law. <hi>Christ condemned sin in the flesh,</hi> by taking on his flesh the curse due to us for sin, &amp; <hi>for sin,</hi> that is, for sins cause, that it might be taken away, <hi>he sent his Son to die,</hi> Rom. 8.3. and judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn sin. 3. This is to mistate a question well debated and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed by Christ; for he being <hi>the end and perfection of the Law,</hi> hath silenced, and satisfied the Law,<note place="margin">We are not to act of new a plea with the Law, being now in another kingdome and freed from the Law.</note> and to what use can it serve to make a new plea and a bastard controversie with a satisfied party, or to hearken to conscience which craves in the name of mistaken Law well payed debts, and this is but Sathan abusing the Law, and feigning Letters of Caption in the name of the Law, to trouble the quieted conscience of a beleever. But its safest to say, I stand to what Christ hath done and suffered to fulfill the Law, and I believe I was crucified in him, judged, and condemned legally in Christ: and what can you seek more of an ill-doer? He is condemned, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, hanged on a tree, and so is justice quieted. Some raise the devill and a storm in the soul and cannot calm it again: It is not good to provoke, irritate, and waken a sleeping dogge. There is quietnesse and peace of beleeving what Christ hath done as well done, and comfortably to rest on his deed by faith. Hence a case

Hence, we had rather take a Law-way which is not Gods way, as ly under deadnesse; there may be a legall looking upon deadnesse, whereas it is a Gospel-sin that we should be humbled for, and in which we should not please our selves; but no man freed from the Law and brought out of prison, should be willing or desirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the dungeon again. We should let <hi>God</hi> guide us under a feaver, and not be our own Physitians, but be quiet at Christs part, if he be pleased to cure by contrairs, and to quicken me by deadening me, or to make a soul humble by smiting with a spirit of pride: its good, we are to submit.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>How could we be in Christ as in our surety</hi> (for saith <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius) we did not give nor appoint Christ to be our Cautioner or Surety?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

But can any deny but Christ on the Crosse did act the cause of many belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers not born? This is peculiar to this dispensation, that the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, not the debter, appoint both the Law-head, and the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick Surety. The Surety had from us a Cautionary, sponsorie, and deputed nature, but no subscribed commission from us, it was in the heart of the Creditor by grace efficacious to obtain our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and to make a sort of legall marriage assuming our nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we either knew our husband, or gave consent to the marriage-Covenant. As the Advocat speaks in the person of the Client ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and sleeping, and when the Client hears and sees how his cause is promoved, he both assents unto, and renders thanks and praises to the Advocat: and so the absent and far off Client not knowing


<pb n="261" facs="tcp:58986:141"/>
any thing does act in the Advocat. And how many answers doth our Advocat in Heaven make for sinners on earth in his pleadings, of which we know not in particular any thing? Nor doth Christ speak or plead for beleevers as a privat man, nor appear in his Name as it were, but in our person.</p>
               <p>Neither is there a faining of a person here, or a borrowed and fained redemption, there be these five here.<note place="margin">All the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisits to a reall satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction are in Christs dying for us.</note> 1. A Redeemer <hi>Christ.</hi> 2. Persons redeemed, <hi>sinners.</hi> 3. A Lord from whom we are redeemed, the <hi>Lord Jehovah,</hi> not simply, as God, he is the partie from whom we are redeemed, but God as the offended Law-giver, who had us lyable to eternall punishment. 4. There was a <hi>price,</hi> the life and blood of <hi>God,</hi> which though not profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to <hi>God</hi> (for that is extrinsecall to satisfaction reall) yet an aboundant compensation to justice for declarative glory taken from <hi>God</hi> which is the nature of reall satisfaction. 5. There is here a God just, true, holy, unchangeable, to whom the price is payed. Nor does <hi>Christ</hi> sustain the person of the enemy Satan from whom we are redeemed, for he is but the <hi>lictor</hi> who then had no right to detain us, we are redeemed from evils of sin and punishment: Nor doth Christ in suffering sustain the person of God. Hence, from our being crucified with Christ crucified, something is to be said in a practicall way of our mortification; for mortification flows originally from Christs death, we being crucified in him and with him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is mortification?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a deadning of the whole powers and inclinations of the soul in their bentnesse and operations,<note place="margin">What mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is.</note> in order to things forbidden by the Law of God, or in things indifferent and commanded. Hence, not the affections only, but the understanding and mind must be deadned. And therefore this is no mortification untill sin origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall be subdued in its damnation by Christs death, and in its domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by the Spirit of Sanctification. A tree is not withered while standing on its root, bulk and branches are green and flourishing: Its much to know the withdrawing of sap and life from the root and the vitall parts of old <hi>Adam.</hi> The ebbing of a River is not the dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of it; the new birth only is mortification.</p>
               <p>Q. 2. <hi>Since mortification comes only from Christs death, what is the influence of Christs death herein?</hi>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The influence is reall, <hi>ad modum causae physicae,</hi> the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of blood hath <hi>bought us from our vain conversation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18. <hi>Christ</hi> dying doth merit by blood the Spirit, and infused grace, which deadens the whole life of sin. Evangelick Arguments from ten heavens, from ten Gospels working morally and in a swasory way, cannot more work mortification then touching can make a reall change on a dead corps; we was legally dead and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Christ, and with Christ, when he died, many not being born then: But in the infusing of the life of God, Christ applyes the reall principle of mortification. Now the redemption <hi>from a vain conversation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18. <hi>from the present evil world,</hi> Gal. 1.4. is as reall and proper a bargain, except we follow <hi>Socinus, as redemption from the wrath to come.</hi> 2. <hi>Christs</hi> death hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence morall and swasorie to work mortification: As 1 Pet. 1.16. <hi>Be holy.</hi> 17. <hi>Passe the time of your sojourning in fear. For ye are bought</hi> with his blood <hi>from your vain conversation.</hi> And 1 Pet. 5.1, 2. <hi>Christ hath suffered in the flesh, therefore be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to your lusts,</hi> and serve them not, as the Gentiles do: So <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1.5. But the action morall of the Gospel doth not work upon the naturall man:<note place="margin">Gospel ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments how and upon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they work.</note> for like works upon the like; carnall reason upon a carnall spirit; and spirituall Arguments upon a renewed man; as an Argument from a painted feather works upon a child, more then an Argument from an inheritance, which no doubt will work upon a man come to age, and yet neither the one nor the other works upon a renewed mind to remove him off <hi>Christ</hi> his rock.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> No actings. 2. Slow actings and lent. 3. Actings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. 4. Closing with contrair providences, reproaches, work not on mortification to fire the man. Psal. 35.12. <hi>They speak mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous things.</hi> 13. <hi>But I as a deaf man, heard not. David feared to be the reproach of the foolish</hi>: Such a case, though from <hi>God,</hi> would raise a cry in a child of this world.

Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a mad man, none will do that. 2. If any thing, without a child of <hi>God,</hi> work upon him, they move him not much: Psal. 131.2. <hi>Surely I have behaved and quieted my self, as a child that is weaned of his mother, my soul is even as a weaned child.</hi> Acts 20.24. <hi>None of these things move me</hi>: I make not much rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of bands. <hi>Peter,</hi>

What if he tramp upon my eternall Crown, I should lay it down at his feet; and is not this mortification? Should he hide his face, for eternity, from me, and I never see him in his manifestations, so his glory shine in my everlasting sad desertion; there is required an indifferency to all created things without; no peremptory and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute fixednesse of the affection to any good, God excepted, is good: the contrair of this is an ingadging of the heart more then is right to any thing, <hi>give me children, or then I die,</hi> there should be a contented living without children, if God so will: love the creature, as if ye loved not, the Lord would have us hungring for the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet not eagerly desiring, and thirsting, and yet have a lent and well ordered appetite to drink: love the child, but let the heart cleave leasurely to the child. Plowing, and no heart-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring, buying and selling, and no heart-ingadging to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain is best here. 1 Cor. 7. <hi>They that have wives should be as if they had none.</hi> 30. <hi>And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not.</hi> In the acting of affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the things of this life, as father, mother, husband, wife, children, houses, gain, beauty, honour, and new bought farme, there would be a godly distance of the heart from the thing ye do: Loving, and no loving; rejoicing, and no rejoicing; weeping, and no weeping; speaks most mortification. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do here, except sinfully we over-doe, and the out-goings of the heart to the creature must be fierie, which is childish, whereas mortification is a gracious well composed grave temper of the aged in Christ.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Its hard to give the division of them logically: There is 1. a naturall mortification, there is no fire in the affections of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king infants to Crowns, Kingdomes, to treasures of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

               <p n="2">2. There is a compelled mortification, sicknesse and withered arms and legs, and strong fetters in the prison, poverty and want, care for bread, and the armed man poverty that hath a sharp sword, <hi>necessity</hi> blunts the affections in their second acts, the man hath no mind of whooring:<note place="margin">2.

For love of sin being the dominion, life and castle of sin, the more love to the heart-idol and to the right eye, the harder it is to be mortified. Some sins cleave to us as our hair and nails, as a custome of some sinfull words, these are sooner mortified; and yet if mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification be not in the heart, these take life again, as hairs and nails cutted and shaven grow again. The trees in Winter are not dead: but there be master-devils and strongly rooted heart-dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, pride, covetousnesse, to which we are mortified, with a huge greater deal of pains and wrestling, for they are to men as the eye and the right hand.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> As <hi>Isai.</hi> 49 6. he saith, <hi>I have given thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth:</hi> that is, as <hi>Act.</hi> 13.46, 47. I have thee, O Christ, to be the Preached Light, and Guide of the Gentiles, and the Preached Saviour, declared and proclaimed by the Preaching of <hi>Paul, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi> and the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Pastors.</hi> So I will give thee for the Covenant, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Preached surety and Mediator of the Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. When the first Covenant was broken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he makes with us <hi>an everlasting Covenant, even the sure mercies of</hi> David, <hi>Isai.</hi> 55.3. 2. I will give thee as the only one who is the subject of the Gospel and Covenant of Grace: For to Preach Christ and to Preach the Gospel and New Covenant are all one. 3. I have given thee to be the confirmer of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, they are all yea, and Amen, in thee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16.

                  <hi>Q.</hi> But <hi>Socinus</hi> denies that Christ is the purchaser or the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by his blood (as it were) of the New Covenant,<note place="margin">

And <hi>Crellius</hi> and he say, the cause why the confirming of the Covenant is ascribed to the death of Christ, is because as by a slain beast and divided into two parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Covenants of old were established, so by the death of Christ the Covenant of Grace was solemnly confirmed and sealed?</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Ans. Christ</hi> is so the <hi>Surety</hi> as <hi>Mediator,</hi> as he is also the <hi>Author</hi> of this Covenant, as <hi>God, Exod.</hi> 3.6. It was he who said,<note place="margin">Christ is not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And he ascribes to himself the Covenant, Heb. 8.9. <hi>Not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers,</hi> &amp;c. And it is clear, that the pardon of sin promised in the Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. is never ascribed to the blood of Martyrs, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where to Christs blood, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14.14, 15, 22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he is the Surety also of the Covenant, is expresly said, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. and the Mediator thereof, Heb. 8. Nor can it be said that the death of the Testator does properly give faith and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Testament,<note place="margin">The death of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stator how it confirms the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> for the authority and justice of the just or unjust will of the Testator, addeth unto, or diminisheth from the authority of the Testament; for the Testators will is the principal efficient cause of the Testament, the death of the man is only a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary condition, by which the right of the Testator to these goods is transferred from him (who now being dead, needs them not) in to friends, to whom they are left in Legacie;<note place="margin">
                     <p>It is true that the death of the Testator, to wit such a death of one who is more then a Testator or only man, even God man, procu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>There is a far other thing in Christs blood then power of sealing and witnessing the truth which is in the Martyrs blood.</p>
                  </note> and so death is but an antecedent condition of the right to the goods. 3. Christs dying to bear witnesse to his own Gospel is only the secondary end of his death, in so far as secondarily remission of sins is made known to us after the principall end of his death, to wit, reconciliation, remission, pardon, redemption, and life is purchased to us by way of merit: And sure the truth of pardon and redemption is hugely more confirmed and sealed by the whole company of the Martyrs, and made known to the sons of men, then by the death of one single man, <hi>Maries Son:</hi> Nor does the Scripture ever commend Christs love to us in sealing the Gospel with his blood as the only way to life, or making this the most strong Argument to move us

If Christ were not a Person different from offended <hi>God,</hi> as the Godhead is common to all the three, so in a voluntary and admirable dispensation and Oeconomie the Kings Son, a Person different from the Father, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth upon him our nature; And 3. having mans nature which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and so being fit therein to satisfie wrath, and fit therein to merit, to <hi>sanctifie the people with his own blood,</hi> might well be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our side: and there's no scenick, no seeming, but a most reall satisfaction here, in that there is a most full and reall compensation made to offended justice, and our faith laying hold on this, the conscience is quieted.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>God is, and may be dispensed withall: So as Justice as Justice seeks payment,<note place="margin">Justice as justice seeks satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of free-grace, not justice, determines how, and who shall pay.</note> the Creditor as the Creditor seeks recompence and restitution: But by whom, Justice deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines not, whether payment and satisfaction be made by the same very person who offended, or by a fit surety in the person and place of the offender, as it determines not whether as much or far more be restored then was taken away, so there be a compact and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary agreement between the satisfier and the satisfied. Hence, Justice being 1. offended, is not (to speak so) the interposing and the mediating attribute of God; but Soveraignty of Free-grace and mercy interposeth.<note place="margin">Justice is not the me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diating and interposing attribute, but free-grace.</note> 2. Justice may seek payment from the only offending partie, and from no other, from <hi>Adam</hi> and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity only; but Justice doth not indispensably, and by necessity of nature exact payment from the only offender and from no other. 3. The conscience of the beleever may with sweetnesse of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and peace rest upon satisfied justice, and adore interposing grace, and be quickened from looking unto, and loving interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing grace, to obey and take on the labour of Gospel-love to run the wayes of his Commandements. 4.

               <p>Ans. <hi>Socinians, Arminians,</hi> yea <hi>Pagans,</hi> and all enemies to Christian Religion, are burdened with the same seeming reason: For if God, or their gods may hinder wickednesse, and yet do not hinder it, they bring themselves, or the true God, that they must be necessitated to torment the sinners.</p>

The out-goings of free-grace must eternally be hid, if sin had never been. As there had been no field for the expressions and blossoms of eternall flourishing revenging justice: As also, the creatures armes are short, and could not reach the eminent degree of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing the glory of free-grace and pardoning mercy, but the Lord aimed at this. And 1. the relation of a Saviour and a sinner, of the Physician and the sick must be known; Now a Physician hath not relation actuall to all sick, all the world over, but only to his own patients, his own sick ones, who by Covenant, feeling their

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:58986:157"/>
be healed by such a Physician. But sinning and falling being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in relation to a more universall good, there is more excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Gospel-rising then in Law-standing: As, 1. There is more feeling deeper sense in the woman which <hi>did wash Christs feet with her tears,</hi> and <hi>wipe them with the hair of her head,</hi> then in some who never so fell. And <hi>Christ</hi> may hold forth something of this, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.7. <hi>Likewise I say unto you</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>there is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more then over nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and nine just persons that need no repentance.</hi> True it is our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours scope is not to compare repentance and Law-innocency toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or to show that the <hi>Pharisees</hi> needed no repentance, as if they were not in a lost condition: but to show what joy was in heaven with the Lord the father of the forlorn son, and in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, at the home coming of repenting sinners. And is not a Jewell of ten thousand millions of more worth then a Diamond that is not worth the eighth part of that summe? <hi>Adams</hi> innocency and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sinning should have been by the common influences of Law-love, and the same may be said of Angel-innocency. But Gospel-repentance is the gift procured at a dearer rate, Christ was exalted a Prince to give repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. Neither should there be sense and such loving sense of free grace in the forlorn son, had he never fled away from his father, and never been so received with a welcome of grace which he beleeved, before he felt it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. The Covenant of Redemption is explained in three eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall acts. <hi>1.</hi> Designation, decree or ordination, and delectation in the work. <hi>2.</hi> Mercy and peace, truth and righteousnes are agreed in this Covenant. <hi>3.</hi> The designed sending of the Spirit cannot be a Covenant as this was. <hi>4.</hi> The twelfth Argument. <hi>5.</hi> The thoughts of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall love.</head>
               <p>THe Covenant of Redemption is two wayes considered. 1. As transacted in time between <hi>Jehovah</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> in his actuall discharge of his office of King, Priest and Prophet. 2. As it is an eternall transaction and compact between <hi>Jehovah</hi> and the second Person the <hi>Son of God,</hi> who gave personall consent that he should be the Undertaker, and no other. And these three acts are consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in the Persons in this latter consideration:
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Designation of one.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Decree and destination.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. <hi>Delectation in the work.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>As to the first: There must have been a Person, either the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,


<pb n="303" facs="tcp:58986:163"/>
or the Son, or the Spirit. 1. By God, from eternity set apart, separated, and designed: And 2. This person must have given an actuall consent from eternity to the designation: Now the person designed was the Son only, this lot eternally (to speak so) fell upon only him who was, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Lamb fore-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained before the foundation of the world,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.20. And because <hi>Christ-God</hi> equall with the Father, does not begin to consent and agree to the designation in time, nor can <hi>Christ-God</hi> will any thing in time, which he did not will, and consent unto, from eternity; therefore he was present with the Father, and consented unto the designation, and closed the bargain from eternity: upon which account, Christ had the glory of a designed Saviour with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, before the world was, and prayes that he may, <hi>God-Man,</hi> be glorified, as touching the manifestation of that glory to Angels and men, with the glory <hi>that he had with the Father before the world was,</hi>

And who sees not our debt of love, for a foresight and providence of pure grace? Behold a designed Physician before we be sick, and Christ with his own consent, writing himself the repairer of the breaches before the house fall, and the healer and binder up before the bones be broken.</p>

Hence, 2. offended Justice by the breach of the Covenant of Works in all the three Persons pleads that man should die, and that pleading is most just, and the Law cannot be broken nor repealed. <hi>The soul that sins must die,</hi> Ezech. 18. the threatning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. must be fulfilled. 2.

It seems naturall and not voluntary, that there is such an admirable order of working as the Father creates by the Son, as by his eternall wisedome, but yet a person, a suppositum, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Father, and by the Spirit, as his mighty power: a third Person. 2. The Son is decreed with his own consent to be the Person, to empty himself, to be in time cloathed with our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to put on the state and legall condition of a Covenant-Obeyer of <hi>God</hi> to the death, the death of the crosse, and is made a little lower then the <hi>Angels:</hi> and this may well be called a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-transaction, and a course of Covenant-obedience in the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, which condition the Holy Ghost comes not under. And what should man say when the votes of the Three carries it, that our iniquities should be laid on the Son, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.6. and the Son should be sent, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. and he from eternity should step out. <hi>Lord, send me, here am I to do thy will.</hi> Joh. 3.13. <hi>No man</hi> (no person) <gap reason="foreign">

But 2. as it is laid upon him now God-Man, and the Word made flesh, he is under a necessity to give perfect obedience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Therefore coming into the world:</hi> The Son being to enter into the world, and to take on our nature, speaketh to the Father, thus: <hi>Sacrifice and offerings thou desirest not,</hi> as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piations to take away sin, for they cannot expiate sin, <hi>A body thou hast framed to me,</hi> which is the only one sacrifice of the true Lamb of God which taketh away sin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. and that once for all: And there are not any sacrifices ever to come after, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26, 28. And perfect obedience with all the heart was tendered by Christ from a holy nature, he being full of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> from his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb, so as none could accuse him of sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.46. and this obedience had influence in <hi>Christs</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. The condition of justifying faith, laying hold on him who justifies the ungodly, is required of us in our Covenant: There is no such condition required of <hi>Christ</hi> in his Covenant of suretyship.

So also, <hi>Cajetan: Semini autem ejus, tanquam &amp; cui promissa sunt, &amp; in quo adimplenda erant promissa. Corn. à lapide:</hi> If the word seed, <hi>semen,</hi> were taken <hi>collectively,</hi> the promise could not stand; for its sure all the Jews were not blessed in the seed: Yea many of them (saith <hi>Calvin) were a curse. Estius</hi> saith, the word <hi>seed,</hi> is a collective name, and notteth many; and hath not in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew the Plurall Number. <hi>Augustine</hi> (saith he) will have all Christians following the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> to be here noted, for they are that seed to which the promise is made, whereas <hi>Christ</hi> is properly he in whom the promise is to be fulfilled, and in whom all are one by faith,<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. is not made to Christ my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall.</note> and all are reduced to the Singular Number.</p>
               <p>There is no reason to expound the <hi>Seed Christ,</hi> of <hi>Mysticall Christ</hi> and of his Seed. 1. Because the <hi>Seed</hi> is he <hi>in whom the Nations are blessed,</hi> both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> v. 14. And the


<pb n="313" facs="tcp:58986:168"/>
Seed <hi>made a curse for us,</hi> v. 13. But this seed is only <hi>Christ,</hi> not <hi>mysticall Christ,</hi> head and members: for neither are we blessed in <hi>Christ</hi> mysticall, nor was <hi>Christ</hi> mysticall the Church made a curse for us: Nor did the Church mysticall pay a price of satisfaction to offended justice for us, <hi>v.</hi> 19. The word <hi>seed</hi> seems to have the same signification, <hi>v.</hi> 16. and <hi>v.</hi> 19. Consider then, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then serveth the Law? It was added because of transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, untill the seed come, to whom the promise was made.</hi> Now the <hi>seed coming</hi> is <hi>Christ</hi> coming in the flesh to take on our nature. If the seed were taken for Christ mysticall, the Apostle must say, <hi>The Law was added because of transgression, untill the seed should come:</hi> that is, untill <hi>Christ</hi> mysticall, his Church should come in the flesh, which is non-sense. 3. Whether the promise be of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and of life eternall thereby holden forth; Or of <hi>Christ</hi> to come of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in whom all flesh shall be blessed; or of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse by faith, not by the works of the Law; Or of all these coming under the name of the <hi>inheritance,</hi> the promise is made to many in number like the Stars: For the Lamb and the hundreth fourty and four thousands standing with him on Mount Zion, and the thousands of thousands which none can number, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9. are many, and may well be called <hi>seeds</hi>; And though they be all one in Christ, yet the Apostle must speak too ambiguously, when he said, The promise of righteousnesse and life is made to the <hi>seed,</hi> that is, to Christ head and members: for the promise is so made to Christ, especially of life, pardon, righteousnesse, as the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings promised are fulfilled &amp; given through, &amp; for Christ as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meritorious cause, as all grant: which way the promises are in no sense made to believers, who cannot come in as joint satisfiers with <hi>Christ,</hi> &amp; as joint meritorious procurers with Christ of the blessings promised to us. 4. The promise is made to the <hi>seed</hi> coming in the flesh, and assuming our nature in a personal union, <hi>v.</hi> 19. as is, by confession of all, expounded. Now this restricts the promise to <hi>God incarnate,</hi> and must exclude the members. 5. It runs most connaturally to the Text, and comfortably to us, if neither Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. be understood as a private man, the <hi>Sonne of Mary:</hi> nor yet as <hi>Christ mysticall,</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. But as Christ, a publike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Lord-Mediator.</hi> 1. He represents all the

               <p>Were it no more but that, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Because I live, ye shall live also:</hi> ye shall live by promise, the free promise of life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: its no small vantage.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The promises are laid down in <hi>Christ</hi> as in a publike <hi>Lord-Keeper.

The <hi>13.</hi> Argument, from the necessity of Gods call. <hi>2.</hi> Of Typicall sprinkling of the blood of the Covenant, and of the Testament: The place, <hi>Heb. 13.20.</hi> the blood of the everlasting Covenant opened. Of the place, <hi>Heb. 7.22.</hi> the act of suretyship, the assurance of our state.</head>
               <p>AN Argument 13. is taken from the necessity of this Covenant of Redemption. 1. From the call of <hi>God</hi>: Christ took not on him to be a Priest, <hi>nor did he glorify himself to be made an High Priest, but that he said unto him,</hi> Heb. 5. <hi>Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee</hi>: That is, I have ordained thee to have the honourable calling of the High Priest. The Apostle also, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. applyeth this in part to the eternall generation of the Son: And <hi>Act.</hi> 13.33. the Apostle applyes this to <hi>Christs</hi> rising from the dead, because in these two latter, manifestly appears the God Head of the Son, in that he is true High Priest, who, by offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self hath taken away our sins,<note place="margin">He who took not on him to be Priest and King, but upon the call of God must be made Priest and King by Covenant.</note> which only <hi>God</hi> can do. In the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He is declared to be the Son of God with power, — by the resurrection from the dead.</hi> He who took not upon him to be High Priest while <hi>God</hi> called him, and neither took upon him to be King, while <hi>God</hi> called him, and said, Psal. 2.6. <hi>I have Anointed him my King, upon my holy Hill of Zion,</hi> and willingly consented to the call of <hi>God,</hi> to be King and Priest. He must be made Priest and King by Covenant between him and <hi>God</hi>: for Priests and Kings were called by Covenant, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 5. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11.17. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is necessarie that the promises that are our Writs and Charters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Heaven be in a surer hand then in our own, to wit, in the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of <hi>Christ:</hi> For this is an absolute promise made to us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh.</hi> This promise is not formally made to <hi>Christ,</hi> yet it is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Covenant-promise, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. for there is no stony heart in <hi>Christ,</hi> yet the promise is laid down in him, and made

Some say, as <hi>Calvin, Luther, Muscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> by the Preached Gospel: But it is clear, he alludeth to the Law of sprinkling, Exod. 24.8. <hi>And</hi> Moses <hi>took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which the Lord hath made with you, concerning all these words.</hi> Now of that blood it is said, Exod. 24.6. <hi>And</hi> Moses <hi>took half of the blood</hi> (of the oxen that the young men of the children of Israel offered, <hi>v.</hi> 5.) <hi>and put it in basons,</hi>

(say the <hi>English</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines) <hi>the mutuall stipulation of God</hi> (of Christ God the true Altar) <hi>to his people, and his people to him, who were atoned and made one by the blood of Christ,</hi> v. 7.

Then it was the Book of the Judiciall Lawes and Promises, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.19. <hi>For when Moses had spoken every Precept to all the people according to the Law: he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water</hi> (lest the blood should thicken and congeal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor being mixt with water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notting also some other mysteries, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.6, 8.) <hi>and scarlet, wool and hysop, and sprinkled both the Book and all the people.</hi> Its true there is no mention of <hi>wool</hi> and <hi>hysop</hi> and <hi>scarlet,</hi> Exod. 24. but the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> adds nothing of his own to <hi>Moses:</hi> for there's a ground for these, <hi>Num.</hi> 19.6. and <hi>Moses</hi> speaks not of the sprinkling of the Book, but the Book lying upon the sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Altar was also sprinkled with blood; for saith the Holy Ghost, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Almost all things are by the Law purged with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgivenesse of sins.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling of the Book with bloud.</note> There was no guiltinesse in the Book, but these written Lawes and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were the <hi>hand-writing of Ordinances which was against us, which was contrary to us: which Christ by his bloody death behoved to blot out, take out of the way, and nail to His Crosse,</hi> Colos. 2.14.</p>

               <p n="2">2. His dying is considered as a Testament of a dying friend.

The essence and nature of a Testament is saved, whether the goods that are bequeathed in legacy be the free gift of the Testator, not bought with a price by him, or goods of the father of the friend, to which the friend being a German-brother hath as good right or the same right, by birth, that the Testator hath. How ever: the comparison holds in this. <hi>Christ</hi> 1. hath bequeathed to believers these goods. 2. The Testament is no Testament, nor valide in Law, except the Testator be dead. No man can sue by Law tested goods, if the Testator himself be living; Nor can we have right to a new heart, forgivenesse, perseverance, eternall life, to grace and glory, except <hi>Christ</hi> our Testator had died. But because the Tested goods are more then goods left to us in Testament; they are left to us by such a Testament as is both a Testament and a death

               <p>Now here is a judiciall and a Law-act of suretyship put upon Christ. 1.

For in Christs coming under that act, when he was made Surety, there be two things: 1. His eternall condiscending to take on him our nature, and to empty himself and be a servant. 2. His agreeing and plighting of his faith and truth to take on our condition in Law, that <hi>God</hi> should lay upon him the iniquity of us all, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.6. and that <hi>God</hi> should make him <hi>who knew no sin, to be sin for us,</hi>

               <p>But it may be said, if Christs dying for sinners remove as a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory punishment, the guilt and obligation to eternall wrath, what way is the reall, and as it were, the physicall inherency and essence of sin removed? <hi>Ans.</hi> The obligation to wrath is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved only in a legal way by suffering of punishment due to sin,<note place="margin">Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a Surety can remove pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment from the guiltyman, but cannot remove formally the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent guilt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make him formally and physically and inherently innocent, except the punishment of the Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty so excellent procure, by way of merite, the expelling of sin, and the incoming of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent holinesse in its room, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>10.</note> which <hi>Christ</hi> hath done; But the essence reall of sin is only removed, as every other contrair is removed, by the expelling of sin out of its subject, and by introducing the contrair form, to wit, inherent righteousnesse, and the perfect habit of Sanctification and holiness. Now for this, <hi>Christs</hi> dying and suffering wrath due to us, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Christ</hi> should die a thousand thousand times for us, his dying cannot as a satisfying cause, or as a punishment remove this. For 1. a punishment suffered by our Surety can but exhaust and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the punishment due to the sinner for whom the suretyship is undertaken. But 2. <hi>Christs</hi> dying cannot as a punishment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move


<pb n="324" facs="tcp:58986:174"/>
sin as sin, and as contrair to the holy Law, and make us defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led wretches and servants of sin holy, as the paying of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns for a forlorn waster, cannot make him to be no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and a man that hath obeyed the Law; only it makes that in Law the payment cannot be charged upon him. 3. Christs tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacting with God as our Surety is not only then meerly to remove eternall punishment, but to purchase by the merit of his death the healing and sanctifying of our nature, Heb. 10.10. <hi>By the which will we are sanctified by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What will of GOD, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. sanctifieth us.</note> Then our Sanctification is procured to us by the will of <hi>God,</hi> not simply as his commanding will: for then should all and every one whom the Lord commands to be holy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. be sanctified, which we see is not done: but by the will of the Father, commanding <hi>Christ</hi> to die, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.31. and the will of Christ offering himself once for a sacrifice for sin, is the will which sanctifies us. So <hi>Pareus</hi> well saith, it is the will with its correlate, for in the willing passive obedience of <hi>Christ</hi> are we sanctified real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the merit of his death, though this be wrought by degrees. 2. Since the Father consents and wills that <hi>Christ</hi> die, and the Son willingly offers himself a sacrifie, the number (as judicious and Godly M. <hi>Dickson</hi> hath well observed on the place) <hi>and these</hi> all,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>David Dickson,</hi> Exposit. of the Epistle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> cap. 10. v. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>for whom Christ offered himself, were condescended upon betwixt the Father and the Mediatour. God knew those whom he gave to the Son, to be ransoned: and Christ knew those whom he bought.</hi> And the necessity of this Covenant appears in this, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort cannot be solide, if a child of God never have any assurance of his being gifted of the Father to the Son in particular. For two things are clear here. 1. That the Lord knows who are his, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. and that, if <hi>God</hi> gave some to the Son, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. then the Son received them in a certain number. And if Christ bought them by Covenant,<note place="margin">Solid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in knowing these num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of these gifted to the Son, &amp; I am one of them.</note> he must know how many: As one who buyes a flock, but he knows the quality and number of the flock. 2. The knowledge sometime shall be this distinct, that I was by name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, <hi>who loved me, and gave himself for me.</hi> And as the offering of every Priest is by way of Covenant and promise, so, if a sacrifice, in the faith of the great sacrifice, be offered to <hi>God,</hi> then will <hi>God</hi> accept it (here is a Covenant) so is the Body of <hi>Christ</hi>


                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:58986:174"/>
offered by the Covenanting-will, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. And any doubt that may, or doth arise concerning your self by name: 1. It may as well be moved, in some respect, against the whole number, and no wise man will say that the bargain betwixt the Father and the Son was so blind, as the number was not agreed upon. For since all the bought are sinners, and so inclined to sinfull doubting of the bargain, that, which as a doubt is moved by one, may be moved by all severally, and all severally denying themselves to be the men for whom <hi>Christ</hi> bargained: By this sinfull questioning of the transaction, none at all were agreed upon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Every doubting of Gods love to me once justified, and who have once fled to <hi>Christ</hi> for refuge, is grounded upon sin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse; now none were given by the Father to the Son from eternity upon respect of either faith, or unbeleef, or holinesse, or bad deserving: Its true, it is not known to me but by beleeving,<note place="margin">Sin is no cause why a justified one should doubt of his justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</note> that I was given Covenant wayes to the Son. But the Question is, if sin be any ground why one justified should cashier himself out of the number of the gifted ones to Christ, and committed to the Mediatour. Its true, it should be mourned for as a thing that doth not a litle hinder Sanctification in its progresse, but should not brangle Justification, nor the faith of our interest in Christ. 4. The necessity of this Covenant appears, in that salvation is taken off free-will, and the slippery <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>no,</hi> of free-will in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, and laid upon one that is mighty, upon <hi>David,</hi> to govern Israel as their King;<note place="margin">M. <hi>D.

Its but said in vain that <hi>God</hi> promises they shall be Christs gifted seed, providing they be willing to beleeve: that is but to say, the Lord promises all shall be his seed, providing they shall be his seed: For willing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving makes them his seed. 2.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Christ</hi> agrees to the designed person: <hi>It is written of me,</hi> and so decreed of <hi>God</hi> from eternity, <hi>I delight to do thy will,</hi> I shall lay down my life for these given to me: And here the other party, <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> coming by his own consent to die, does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so undertake, 1.

               <p>Hence, if we imploy faith, and hold out to the Lord the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking for us in the Covenant, there is an answer framed to all our temptations from our own frailty:<note place="margin">This Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers our tentations.</note> As <hi>Adam</hi> and the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> fell, and how can we stand?

the Law and Covenant of Works, Christ-Man also must be under the same. And then <hi>Christ</hi> the Mediator was to give obedience to a particular Commandement of laying down his life for sinners, and this required an ingadgement by way of Covenant, and so a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of obedience to perform what this peculiar Law of Suretyship required of him, to wit, to lay down his life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Its not a condition of indifferency which is required of Christ, such as is required of <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">No such condition is required of Christ as of <hi>Adam</hi> or of us, nor was he under any threatning, but had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firming grace from the womb.</note> in which there is a hazard of failing and coming short of the reward. <hi>Adams</hi> Covenant had both threatnings and promises, and so hath our Covenant of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though in another way: see <hi>Psal.</hi> 89.30, 31, 32.

There was no hazard nor possibility, in regard of the Personall Union, that <hi>Christ</hi> could sin: yea, in regard that Christ from the womb was both a Traveller, a <hi>Viator</hi> and an enjoyer and <hi>Comprehensor,</hi> and had the Spirit above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure from his birth, as Man he had gifted to him the confirming grace which is now given to the Elect Angels in their Head Christ; And therefore there was somewhat like a condition necessary, and as the members enter to glory through obedience, so also the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted Head, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.26. <hi>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter in to his glory?</hi>

What was the speciall condition of the Covenant of Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyship? <hi>Ans.</hi> The Covenant being a bargain of buying a people to <hi>God,</hi> then the payed price and ransone must be the duely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall condition.
