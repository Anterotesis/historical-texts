            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </head>
               <p>WE must distinguish between the intent of the threatner, and the intent and sense of the threatning.</p>
               <p>Law-threatnings may be well exponed, by the execution of them, upon persons, against whom they are denounced: As, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.30. compared with 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.15, 16. Ten Tribes are taken from <hi>Davids house according to the Word of the Lord.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause therefore the threatning of death was executed upon <hi>Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. then must the threatning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. have been intended against the Man <hi>Christ,</hi> and because beleevers die, as all do, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. the threatning must have been intended against them also,<note place="margin">The death threatned, <hi>Genes.</hi> 2.17. was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the intent of the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, partly legall, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</note> for that <hi>they sinned in Adam,</hi> and because it is out of question that the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate die the first and second death, the threatning must also have been intended against them. And therefore, in the intent of the threatner, the threatning was mixed, partly Legall, partly Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick; According to the respective persons, that the Lord had in his eye: He had therefore in his heart both Law and Gospel. It is therefore to no purpose to aske what kind of death, and whether purely legall, which the Lord threatned to <hi>Adam</hi>: For the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion

supposeth that the Covenant of Works was to stand, and that the Lord was to deny a Saviour to fallen man.

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. Adam</hi> was to believe he should certainly die; For so was the threatning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. if he should sin, or then we must say, that <hi>Adam</hi> was to beleeve he should not actually die, the latter cannot be said, for then he was to believe the contradicent of the <hi>Lords</hi> true threatning; which was the lie of the Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>Ans.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What threatnings are, and what sorts there be of them.</note> He was to beleeve neither of the twain according to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, for there are two sort of threatnings, some pure and only threatnings, which reveal to us, what <hi>God</hi> may, in Law, do, but not what he hath decreed and intended, <hi>actu secundo &amp; quoad eventum,</hi> to do, and bring to passe; These threatnings contain some condition, either expressed in other Scripture, or then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the mind of the <hi>Lord.</hi> 1. Because the Lord so threatned <hi>Adam,</hi> as he remained free and absolute either to inflict the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to provide an Evangelick remedy, even as <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.37. saith to <hi>Shimei (in the day thou passest over the brook Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, thou shalt surely die)</hi> that is, thou shalt be guilty of death, <hi>reus mortis:</hi>

               <p>Obj. <hi>Then in all threatnings and promises we are not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that though we sin, we shall actually</hi> &amp; quoad eventum <hi>die, and though we obey and beleeve, wee are not to beleeve that GOD shall fulfill his promise, and that our salvation shall come to passe, only we are to believe</hi> jure, <hi>that we deserve to die, and that we shall have eternall life,</hi> jure promissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, <hi>but not actually and according to the event.

If therefore <hi>Adam</hi> did beleeve that he and all his should in their own persons actually suffer the first and second death, and that irrecoverably, he had no warrand, for any such belief, and the like may be said of <hi>Nineveh.</hi> For when the Lord said, <hi>in the day that thou eats thou shalt die, the first and second death,</hi> thou and all thy children personally; His meaning was, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I provide an Evangelick remedy and a Saviour.

               <p>Obj. <hi>Adam was to beleeve no such exception. Answ.</hi> True. Because it was not revealed, nor was he to beleeve the contrary that he should irrecoverably and eternally perish, because that


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58986:12"/>
was not revealed: But the threatning of the Law doth not deny the Evangelick remedy, as it neither doth affirme it.</p>

                  <note place="margin">What <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was to beleeve in the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, what the lying Serpent would have him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</note>Obj. <hi>Then was</hi> Adam <hi>to believe, it was true which the Serpent said, ye shall not surely die,</hi> &amp; quoad eventum, <hi>but ye shall be as Gods living and knowing good and evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Neither doth that follow, for in the meaning of the liar, it was not true, that they should not die, either by deserving (for Satan brangles the equity and righteousness of the Law and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) or actually and in the event, for both were false and neither revealed, and faith is not to go beyond what is revealed of God. And Sathan disputed against both the equity of the threatning, as if it had been unjust, in Law, and against the event, as a fiction and a thing that should not come to passe in the event, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed did not come to passe: but not according to the Serpents ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and false principles.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Was then</hi> Adam <hi>to despair and to beleeve nothing of a Saviour. Ans.</hi> He was not obliged to despaire, but to rely, by vertue of the first Commandement of the Decalogue, upon God infinitly powerfull, mercifull, gracious, and wise to save, for that was revealed and written in his heart, and that is far from despai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: But in the intervall between the fall and the Lords publishing the blessed Gospel, and news of the seed to come, he was so to trust in God for possible deliverance in generall (as the Law of Nature requireth) but he was to beleeve nothing of unrevealed particulars, far lesse of the mystery of the Gospel, <hi>which was kept secret, since the world began, Rom.</hi> 16.25.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Then may also the damned in Hell, who are not loosed from their obligation to the Law of Nature,</hi>

                  <hi>and the first Command, be obliged to rely on an infinite and Almighty God, for their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, for they are not obliged to despair, nor is there an obligation to any sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is not the like reason, for though the damned be not loosed from the Law of Nature, but are to rely upon God in his whole al-sufficiency, yet with exception of his revealed Justice and Truth: Now he hes expresly revealed, that <hi>their worm never dieth, and their fire never goeth out.</hi> And to believe that, is not to despaire.

touching that threatning, who never heard of the Gospel?</hi>

                     <p>The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair to the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>How the Gospel may be deduced from the Law, if an act of the free-will, grace and infinit wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of GOD be added to make good the assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
                     <p>How the promises are to be beleeved, and how in them, we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve both the equity and event of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, if the condition be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and how the difference must be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the threatnings</p>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> They are under the Law of Nature, and to beleeve that sin deserves wrath, according to the infinitnesse of the Majesty, against whom it is committed, and to obey the Law of Nature, and read the Book of the Creation carefully: But and if the news and rumor of a Saviour come to their ears, their sin cannot but be Evangelick, in not pursuing the reality and truth of such a soveraign remedy. Yet it is not to be thought, that though the Gospel be come to all Nations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.26. that that is to be meant. 1. Of every Generation of all Nations. Or, 2. of the individuall persons, either young, or come to age, of every Nation <hi>under Heaven,</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and Scripture speaketh against both.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But is not the Covenant of Grace contrary to the Law and Covenant of Works? Answ.</hi> A diversity there is, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wills in the holy Lord cannot be asserted. Yea the Gospel may be proven out of the Law, and from the first Commandement of the Decalogue, if any act of the Lords free will and infinite wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome shall be added to prove the Assumption. So,</p>
               <p>If the first Command teach that God is infinitely wise, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, gracious, just, and able to save, then, if so it please him, he shall save;</p>
               <p>But the first Command teacheth the former: And the Gospel revealing the unsearchable riches of Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8. expresly saith so much. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the promises, they contain not only the <hi>jus,</hi> equity and goodnesse of the thing promised, but also that the Lord shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually perform, yea and intends to perform, what he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon condition that we perform the required condition. And in this the promises differ not a little from these threatnings, that are only threatnings, of what God may do in Law, but not from these threatnings which are both threatnings and also Propheticall predictions of what shall come to passe, therefore must we here difference betwixt threatnings, and such and such threatnings.</p>
               <p>The promises are considered as they are Preached and anuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all within the Visible Church, and as they are made in the intention of God with the Elect and Sons of the promise: The same way the threatnings admit of a two-fold consideration. The

                  </note> reveal that both the Lord minds to give the blessing promised, and the condition that is grace to perform the condition, and so they are promises Evangelick both in the matter, and in the intention of the Lord: But as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned to the reprobate, who are alwayes from their birth to their death under a Covenant of Works, really as touching the LORDS holy Decree, they are materially Evangelick promises, but formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in the Lords intention legall, as every dispensation to them is legall, forasmuch as the Lord hath decreed to deny the grace, by which they may or can fulfill the condition of the promise, which is proper to the Law, as it is peculiar to the Gospel, that the Lord both gives the mercy promised and also the grace to fulfill the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the promise.</p>
               <p>The threatnings to beleevers, especially such as are legall <hi>(if you beleevers fall away,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Law-threatnings to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelick, and how.</note>

Nor that he wills that they should beleeve either their eternall damnation, or their finall and totall falling away, which inevitably leads thereunto. For they, knowing that they are in Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16, 17. and freed from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. are to beleeve the contraire of the former, to wit, life eternall, <hi>John</hi> 4.24. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.9. <hi>John</hi> 3.16. and the contraire of the latter, to wit, the promise of perseverance made to them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39, 40. <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.21. <hi>John</hi> 10.27, 28. <hi>John</hi> 17.20, 21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16, 17, 19. Therefore these threatnings are not to be beleeved by the regenerate, as certainly to come to passe in their persons, but only as Law-motives to presse them to work out their salvation in fear and trembling, and to cleave so much the closser to Christ, as the condition of such as are under the Law is apprehended to be dreadfull. But reprobats and unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are not to beleeve that God decrees and intends to them the thing promised, and grace to perform the condition, but only to beleeve their obligation to fiduciall relying upon, and Gospel-faith

Believers are to believe the Decree of God to save them, though they hear the threatnings, for its revealed. But the Reprobate are to beleeve only the sense and Law-deserving and event of the threatning, if they repent not, but are to beleeve no decree to save them.</p>

The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their sins and the wrath they are under is two wayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. 1. Materially in the bulke, and so they are under Law-stroaks and Law-wrath, that is Law-punishment, as others are, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. and so the other places are to be taken. 2. The wrath is to be considered formally, and so it is denyed that the punishment of the non-converted elect, because of their sinfull way is any part of the Law-vengeance or curse which Christ did bear for their other sins committed by them after conversion. 1. Because when Christ

saith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.4.

Therefore the half or a part of satisfactory vengeance, cannot be upon us, and the other half on <hi>Christ,</hi> for this is to make men and Martyrs joint satisfiers of justice with Christ, by their own blood and sufferings, to prevent the scaddings of purgatory; For though we teach against <hi>Antinomians,</hi> that the Godly are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for sins according to Justice, yet that is Evangelick, not law-justice, for they bear not one dram weight of satisfactory wrath and curse jointly with Christ, <hi>Antinomians</hi> say that sin, root and branch is taken away in Justification, so that there is no sin nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for sin in the justified man. 4.

Divine Justice for sins, must be halfed and parted between <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> which the Scripture teaches not. Also the Father ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accepts the ransome of Christ, because it is intrinsecally, and of it self sufficiently satisfactory: or because <hi>Iudas</hi> does beleeve it is so; The latter cannot be said, for beleeving adds nothing to the intrinsecall sufficiency of the satisfaction, as not believing dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes nothing from the sufficiency thereof; Yea and so the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers formall reason of accepting of the satisfaction of Christ<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> must be terminated upon our poor act of believing, whereas the formal ground of the acceptation thereof is the intrinsecall excellency and worth of the Sacrifice, <hi>being an offering of a sweet smelling sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to God,</hi>

And the reason why he accepts it for <hi>Peter,</hi> not for another, is the election of grace.</p>
               <p>It is true the blood is a price refuseable, but it is this way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseable, because the Lord might have followed a Law-way with <hi>Adam,</hi> and all his sons, and have denyed to give his Son a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some for us, but it is not refuseable, because of any insufficiency in the Ransome. Now faith is to satisfaction as the approximation of, and the laying on of dry fewell to the fire, which is only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of burning, but the fire is the formall cause of burning. Yea if we speak properly faith is not so much as a condition without the which offended Justice is not satisfied, nor is it a condition, by any Scripture of the world, without the which God laid not our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities on Christ, for whether we beleeve or not, <hi>God laid our iniquities upon him, and made him sin for us, Isa.</hi> 53.6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. Therefore, by necessity of Justice, he must accept that Ransome intrinsecally so sufficient, which did restore more glory to God, then the sins of all, for whom Christ died, took from him. Nor is it imaginable to say that any act of obedience or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, can perfect the satisfaction of Christ, and make it suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, yea, or causatively make it ours. For God, by no necessity of Justice, but of his own free pleasure, requireth faith as a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our actuall reconciliation; for beside, that he might have


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58986:15"/>
required any other act of obedience, as love, he might have acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted the Ransome without inquiring any act of obedience, on our part, as the Lord bestowed a calme Sea and deliverance from ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, upon the Idolatrous Sea-men, upon the very act of casting <hi>Ionah</hi> in the Sea, without the intervention of any saving faith on their part;<note place="margin">God may accept the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Christ</hi> without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on our part.</note> As a gracious Prince may send a pardon to free a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Malefactor from death, and may command that it be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid in Law for him, without the mans knowledge, and far more without his acceptance thereof, upon his knees, especially since by a speciall paction between the Father and the Son, he restored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly more Glory to God by suffering for all, for whom he died, then they took from God by their sins, and that restitution was made to Justice without the interveening of any act of the creatures obedience. But the truth is, it is much to be doubted whether they, who hold such a satisfaction to be given of God, for the sins of all, Elect and Reprobate, but so as it shall not be valid in Law, nor effectuall to quiet Justice, but they must all suffer eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall vengeance, and perform personall satisfaction, in Hell, to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, except there interveen an act of obedience of the creature, to make it effectuall, do really and sincerely acknowledge, against <hi>Socinians,</hi> a reall satisfaction and compensation made to offended Justice by Christ: For how is it reall, and not rather scenicall and formall, which may and should be null and in vain, if the creature make it not reall, by beleeving. And especially, if God out of his grace which is absolutely free, work in us the condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving.

               <p>Q. <hi>Was not</hi> Adam <hi>chosen? Ans. Adam,</hi> according to the Lords designe, <hi>finaliter &amp; objectivÃ¨</hi> was created in the state of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination to glory, and grace in Christ as touching his person, but according to his inherent condition, he was created in a legall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, which was a gracious inlet to Christ; And according to his Law-state as he represented all mankinde, he was Created as a lubrick and frail Coppie of weak nature.</p>
               <p>Many who are such as are not chosen are Created and live under a Covenant of Works, having onely some concomitant favours of the Gospel, as the Preaching thereof. 2.

should have a share of Gospel-Grace, but it may be replyed to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why should it seeme to be a part of the goodnesse and bounty of <hi>God</hi> to will and desire all and every one to be saved, and not to institute such a dispensation, as all and every one should actuallie be saved? 2.

               <p n="3">3.

Yet from this it followes, no more that these are two Covenants, then that there be two Covenants of Grace, Because faith in God, and the Morall Law in an Evangelick way are therein commanded, and also some duties touching the seals by a positive Law are therein contained.</p>

Common sense will say no more follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but goodnesse and bounty intrinsecall are essentiall to God, and these attributes are essentiall to him, and were from eternity in him, and are his good and bountifull nature; Though not either man, Angel, or any thing else had been created, to which he doth actually extend his goodnesse. <hi>Ergo,</hi> this actuall extension of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is not essentiall to God, so neither is the actuall punishing of sin essentiall to God, but free, though <hi>Adam</hi> apprehended God would punish his eating of the forbidden tree; Yet if he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended that he should not be God, if he did not punish it, his apprehension was erroneous. And this only followes that there is an intrinsecall and internall Justice in God, naturall and essentiall in God, but so that the out-goings of his Justice, the egressions are most free, and that is said by some without all reason, because <hi>the apprehensions we have naturally of God that he punisheth sin, Vniversales apprehensiones, nequaquam sunt eorum quae Deo vel adesse vel abesse possunt pro liberrimÃ¢ voluntate.</hi> Universall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions, therefore they are not apprehensions of such things as may be, or not be in God, according to his free pleasure, if the apprehensions of Gods doing good to Angels, to men, to all his creatures freely, be in all by nature, and cannot be rooted out, and be universall, then these apprehensions cannot be of such things as are in God, according to his most free will, and may be in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty or not be <hi>in him.</hi>

Then the so doing must be in God essentially. 2. Then must God not be God, if he do not good freely to them. 3. Then must God not be God, except he create men, Angels, and creatures. 4. But since he is God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting, he must from everlasting have created men, Angels, and the creatures, and from everlasting he must punish sin; Life may be considered. 1. As life. 2. As such an excellent life, to wit, a communion with God.</p>
               <p>In the former consideration, life is either considered as the end, or secondly as a free reward.<note place="margin">Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with GOD in Glory, is a reward not due by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but by the free gift of GOD, to the most perfect law-obedience.</note> In the former respect.

And God may put the respect of a reward upon any obedientiall end. But that <hi>Adam</hi> should have such an eminent life, for the reward of his obedience as a communion with God, which is farre above his obedience, is the free donation of God: nor is there any necessary connexion between <hi>Adams</hi> perfect obedience, and so high and eminent a life, nor can this Covenant, as touching such a promise, be written in his heart. God then never loved to make any Covenant, yea even that of Works, without some acts and out-goings of grace, and the hyre was grace, how is he not to be served, who loves to hyre and allure us to be happy?</p>

Or how could such justice, by that action be debarred? since justice did not exact such an action: If without violation of justice it might have been omitted, if God should have been infinitely just from Eternitie, if he had done no such thing?

The Lord punished Christ for us to declare the glory of his Justice in punishing sin in his own Son, who was the sinner by imputation, for out of the depth of infinite wisedome, the Lord freely imposes a law upon his creatures: He might have imposed no such law under such a punishment. By no necessity of nature did the Lord threaten death, for the eating the fruit of that tree, prove, that God should not have been God, except he had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned death for the eating of that fruit, and except he had punished


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58986:25"/>
that eating with death, either to be inflicted upon the eater or his surety. <hi>Quid haeres</hi>? Prove that by the Word of <hi>God,</hi> it is sin to eat, when <hi>God</hi> forbids; but the Lords soul hates sin. True, but does the Lords soul hate sin naturally, as he loves himself and by necessity of his essentiall justice as contradistinguished from his immutabilitie, and his truth and faithfulnesse, according to which attributes, he decreed and said, <hi>that the soul that sins shall die,</hi> and (<hi>he that eats shall die</hi>) and he cannot change, nor alter, what he hath decreed, and cannot but be true in his threatnings. But the Question is, whether (laying aside the respect of Gods unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse and truth) there be such a connexion internall, between eating and dying, or between eating forbidden of God, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, as God cannot be equally and essentially just, nor can he be God, except he punish forbidden eating; for sure eating of that fruit, is not of its nature, sin, but it is sin, from the only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding will of <hi>God,</hi> for the Lord had been no lesse essentially just, had he commanded <hi>Adam</hi> to eat of the Tree of Knowledge. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is punished from the forbidding will of <hi>God,</hi> for say that to be punishable or to be punished be essentiall to sin, if eating of such fruit be sin from the forbidding will of <hi>God,</hi> the essence thereof must be from the same forbidding will, then must it follow that <hi>God</hi> hates not all sin, by necessity of nature; And that he hates such eating only conditionally, if he forbid it; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But it is against common sense, to infer, <hi>Ergo,</hi> God sent his Son, by necessity of love, and mercy, and free Grace. So that he should not have been infinitly loving, mercifull, gracious, if he had never sent him. And it is as poor Logick to say, because of grace and free-love he sent his Son, and so might not have sent him, as to say he loved where there was no need,<note place="margin">

All the Scriptures cryes that out of free grace the Lord sent his Son, and delivered him to death; <hi>By the grace of God He tasted death for every man,</hi> Heb. 2.9. Shall we infer there was then no necessity that he should die? It is safest to say the only wise God decreed that sin should be. 2. That the glory of his Justice should appear in taking away sin, not in our way, but in the way of God, to wit, in a way of justice, of mercy, of free grace, in incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable love, of mighty power; and in all these so acts the Lord as he should not leave off to be the Lord, but acts most freely, though he had not taken that course. But far be it from the godly not to adore him in this, as the admirable way beyond the thoughts of men and Angels.</p>

               <p>In all pactions between the Lord and man, even in a Law-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant there is some out-breakings of Grace. Its true, there was no Gospel-Grace, that is a fruit of Christs merite in this Covenant. But yet if grace be taken for undeserved goodnesse: There are these respects of grace. 1. That <hi>God</hi> might have given to <hi>Adam</hi> something inferiour to the glorious Image of God, that consists in true righteousnesse, knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> and holinesse, <hi>Gen</hi> 1.26. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. It was a rich enough stock, this holy Image to be so badly guided. And who looks spiritually to their receipts? Its either too much of grace and holinesse that another hath, and too little that I have, so arises virtuall sighing and grudging at the dispensation. Or 2. a swelling that it is so much, as if it were not receiving. <hi>I am holier then thou, Isa.</hi> 65.5. a miskenning of him that makes me to differ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. A blecking of others, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11. A secret quarrelling at <hi>God</hi> as too strick and hard in his rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.24. And what pride is this, because I am a meer patient under gifted holinesse, to usurpe it as mine own? As if a horse should kick and fling, because he wears a borrowed sadle of silk for a day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Being and dominion over the creatures is of undeserved good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Who looks to a borrowed body and a borrowed soul,<note place="margin">Being, life, and self<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> are undeserved favours.</note> yea and to <hi>self,</hi> and to that which is called <hi>I,</hi> as to a thing that is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gifted? So that though thou be in an high opinion of self, self is self, and what it is, from <hi>God.</hi> And when thou rides, whence is it that I am the rider, and the wearied horse the carrier, but from <hi>God?</hi> 3. The Covenant of Works it self, that <hi>God</hi> out of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty does not command, is undeserved condescending; that <hi>God</hi> bargains for hire, <hi>do this and live,</hi> whereas he may bide a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Law-giver and charge and command us, is overcoming good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.

The influences to acts of obedience, come under a twofold consideration. 1. As congruous and suitable concurrences of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Adams</hi> acts of obedience: And so they were free gifts to <hi>Adam</hi> not promised, as we shall hear in the New Covenant. 2. As such influences by which the standing Elect Angels (who

What Godly trembling is required in us?<note place="margin">Gifts and habits of saving grace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep creatures on foot.</note> 5.

There can be no giving and taking between the creature and the Creator. <hi>Elihu pleads well for him,</hi> Job 35.7. <hi>If thou be righteous what gives thou to him? Or what receiveth he of thy hand,</hi> v. 1. <hi>Thy wickednesse may hurt a man, as thou art, and thy righteousnesse may profite the Son of man.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling thoughts that God needs not men, nor their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, nor any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, shuld take us up.</note> Job 22.2. <hi>Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable to himself?

It is some shining of the excellency of God upon men and Angels, from the works of God, and our obedience to him. But suppose there were no creature to pay the rent of this glory to him, is the Lord a loser therefore? Hath he need of our songs of glory? Or that creatures should be Heraulds of his praise?

                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:58986:29"/>
The father by no paction can remove the foundation of the debt of nature that the son oweth to the father: for impossible it is, but if such a man be son to such a man, but he owe to his father as to an instrument, <hi>quod sit &amp; vivat,</hi> being and living, and the son can not satisfie by paying the father for that summe, and the father can not cancell the band nor give him an acquittance. Far lesse can any recompence the Lord for life and being. The fallen Angels and damned in hell and all wicked men are in the Lords Compt-book everlasting debters to him for being. But <hi>God</hi> who is more then a Father (to whom men are but painted fathers) may thus farre loose the bond, as he may command the son to sacrifice the father, as well as once he commanded the father <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up his son to <hi>God.</hi> But <hi>God</hi> cannot resigne his right that he hath over the creature to a creature, because he cannot leave off to be Creator, and so cannot lay aside or make over Creator-right, <hi>jus Creatoris,</hi> to any.<note place="margin">God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not quite or part with Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor-right &amp; universall dominion over all things that may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and therefore nothing can be given to him.</note> 2. Say that a creature had a <hi>jus</hi> or right over the Creator, it is either an uncreated right or a created right, so to pursue <hi>God</hi> by Law, as to cause him do him justice; it cannot be an uncreated right; for that were near to blasphemie: For no created head can bear the royall Crown of the King of Ages. If it be a created right, this created right must be under the dominion of him who is universall Lord of all: then may the Lord make use of it at his pleasure; then may not the man make use of it at his pleasure: for an absolute dominion of one and the same thing cannot be in the hands of two absolute Lords, who may have contradictory desires concerning the same thing: such as the holy Lord and sinfull men often are. Let us correct the bold pleadings and the daring char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that our vain hearts put upon the <hi>Lord: Why dost thou strive against him</hi> (saith <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job 33.13.) <hi>for he gives not account of any of his matters?</hi> Men dare say, when they are under the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of ordinary sufferings, <hi>The wayes of the Lord are not equal,</hi> Ezek. 33.10. <hi>If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how shall we then live?</hi> But upon whom should sins and transgressions and the punishment thereof be,<note place="margin">We are not to strive with the gracious Lord.</note> if not upon the carcases of the Authors?

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58986:30"/>
that saith something against the veracity and faithfulnesse of <hi>God,</hi> but nothing against the justice. But neither doth a promise as a promise raise a plea of unjustice against the holy and glorious Lord, suppose he should not fulfill his promise. For 1. A paction by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise creats no equality of justice between thing and thing, between wage and work: otherwise he that is called to the Vineyard, and labours from the third hour, hath a just plea: for he should have more wages then a penny, which he gets who labours but one hour.<note place="margin">The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but not the proportion betwixt works and wage is the Lords rule in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding our labour, nor should we be gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, if the <hi>Lord</hi> shuld so deal with us.</note> But the <hi>Lord</hi> makes not the equality or proportion between much labouring for many hours, and the quantity and degree of the wage his r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It followes from the Parable, that Gods bargaining with us depends not upon the equality between thing and thing, the work and the wage; But upon his own free pleasure of disposing of his own: And it is the froathinesse of our nature to judge the penny of Glory, that we get by labouring to be our own, whereas after the promise, and after we have fulfilled the condition, it is not ours, but Gods, and he calls it his own, and it is to be disposed on by the Lords free-grace.

No promise as a promise can give us a proper right, by way of strict justice, to plead with God. 1. A promise of grace is a free promise, and no man can say, because <hi>God</hi> promises the new heart to most undeserving men, that are of a stony heart, and doe profane his holy name, amongst the Gentiles, that therefore it is just by condignitie of the thing,<note place="margin">A promise as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise can give us no right of strict ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to any reward.</note> that a new heart should be given to them, that are <hi>foolish, disobedient, and serving diverse lusts.</hi> The farrest that hard faced Jesuits go in this, is to tell us of the poor penny of the merit of congruity, for the right weight of the summe and thousands of saving grace which Papists have refused as ashamed thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If a promise as a promise should make an equalitie between one thing and another, and so lay a band of strict commutative ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice upon God, then should every promise do the like, <hi>quod con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venit <gap reason="foreign">

For there is no just equality between work and wage here. Nor can ever so feckless

Even so the promise of <hi>God</hi> to give eternall life to the obedience of <hi>Adam</hi> can make no equality of strict justice between the reward and the wage; For the reward promised for the wages is equall and just before the promise, and <hi>ex naturÃ¢ rei</hi>; and so must lay bands on the Lord, so as he cannot do contrair unto it, which is against all reason.</p>

There is no Spirit of God that suggests to them despaire, and bids them write them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the black roll of Reprobates, for though they beleeve hell, as the Devils haply beleeve there is a <hi>God,</hi> yet they blow the coals of that hellish furnace, and kindle a fire before night. 3.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There are two bastard grounds devised by <hi>Arminians.</hi> 1. Because the Covenant of Works cannot oblidge both to active and passive obedience, but to one of them only (say they) and the Covenant of Works was so rigid, that <hi>God</hi> could not follow it out, and cast infants in hell for a sin which is theirs, only by imputation, and was pardoned to the first man that committed it. Therefore he was necessitated to make a Covenant of Grace with all mankind, none excepted. But the Covenant of Works is broken, and can now be a way of Justification and salvation to none, but yet it oblidges all. And sin cannot make us lawlesse, for the spirituall Law is of an eternall obligation. 2. They that never heard of Christ, perish by the Law, and not by the Covenant of Grace of

                     </gap> obedience alwayes.</note> and the Gospel is written in the heart of none. 3. The first Covenant was holy and spirituall, and <hi>God</hi> should unjustly threaten death upon infants, if they be not guilty of eternall condemnation, as <hi>Arminius, disp. pub.</hi> 7. <hi>th.</hi> 16.3. and the Scripture saith, infants are guilty of this sin, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Job</hi> 14.4. As also Christ must not have died for the sins of Infants, if there be no sin in them, they need not the ransome of Christs Blood. The other bastard ground is,<note place="margin">There is sin in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</note> the naturall antecedent desire and love of <hi>God</hi> to have all saved, moved him (say they) to make this Covenant of Grace with all.

                     </gap>ull.</note>1. In the subservient, <hi>God</hi> only approves righteousnesse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes sin; in that of Grace he pardons and renues. <hi>Ans. Acts</hi> 15.11. <hi>We beleeve through the Grace of the Lord Jesus, we shall be saved even as they under that Covenant.</hi> Acts 10.43. <hi>To him gave all the Prophets witnesse, that through his Name, whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beleeveth in him, shall receive remission of sins.

                  <hi>and I will not remember thy sins.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> was a man according to the heart of <hi>God,</hi> So <hi>Asa, Josiah, Jehoshaphat, Samuel, Baruch, Gedeon, Daniel,</hi> the Prophets, under that subservient Covenant (except they be under a fourth Covenant) were renued, justified, saved by faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. as under a Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The former was, <hi>do and live,</hi> this was, <hi>believe and live. Ans.

In the former is compulsion and the Spirit of bondage, in this heart inclining freedom and the Spirit of Adoption. <hi>Ans.</hi> Yet the differences are accidentall, there was a legall awing of the hearts, as if they had been Servants, yet Heirs and Sons they were, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 2. The whole Book of the Proverbs spake to the Godly as to Adopted Sons. They were beleevers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. and so Sons as touching a spirituall state, <hi>John</hi> 1.11, 12. In regard of Oeconomie, it was somewhat more rigid and legall, they were restrained as servants; Yet it was the Covenant of Grace, by which beleeving Jews were justified and saved, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the former man is dead, in this man is humbled for sinne? <hi>Answ.</hi> Legally dead, except they would flee to Christ, and legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned, but there was true humiliation for sins under that Covenant: As <hi>David, Josiah, Hezekiah,</hi> and all beleevers then, as now, were pardoned and justified.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In the former there are commands, not strength, but here there be promises and grace given? <hi>Ans.</hi> The full abundance of grace and of a new heart, was reserved untill now. And the Law could not make perfect nor give pardon, in the blood of beasts; as touching that legall dispensation: But both grace, the Spirit,


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58986:39"/>
pardon, righteousnesse and life were received and beleeved; by looking on Christ to come.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In the former, <hi>Canaan</hi> was promised, in this, Heaven. <hi>Ans. Canaan</hi> is promised only but sacramentally, and that was a poeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogicall promise for the infancie of that Church, but a type which was then in that Covenant, and is not now, make not two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, one then, and another now? Except ye say, there was then a Lamb in the Passeover, which was a Type of Christ to come, and there is now no such Type, because the body is come, and Christ the true High Priest offered himself. Therefore there are two Christs, one then to come, another now who hath come al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.

               <p>But the truth is, the Law as pressed upon <hi>Israel</hi> was not a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

But so infants and all the rest of these Kingdomes who fixedly, in a Church, hear the Word, professe they are followers, and by so doing are witnesses against themselves that they have chosen the <hi>Lord to be their God,</hi> and have consented to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as <hi>Joshua</hi> saith, <hi>Josh,</hi> 24.22. must be under the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cut off from the Covevant, and a place must be shown where <hi>God</hi> hath now under the New Testament, broken the staves of beauty and bands, and hath laid this curse upon all the Infants of Egypt, Assyria, of all the Kingdomes of the earth, that the Lord is now no God to them, and feeds them no more, and therefore <hi>that which dies, let it die, and that which is cut off, let it be cut off,</hi> as it is, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.9. And the like must be said of all that are come to age, and not baptized, or as good as not baptized. And Covenant promises are not to the Children of Beleevers, contrair to <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. nor to the aged, untill they be converted visibly and Baptized; This then hath never yet been fulfilled, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles and Heathen are become the Lords people.

The Lord following the seed of the Godly

with real mercies (so that it cannot be called the favour of a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and instituted or positive priviledge belonging only to the Jews) as that his seed is blessed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.26. <hi>Psal.</hi> 112.2. This mercy must be taken away either in mercie or in wrath: but that a real mercy of a blessing should be taken away in mercy, except a spirituall mercy of saving grace in Christ were given in place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, cannot be said, far lesse hath it any truth that a real mercy can be removed in wrath from Infants in Jesus Christ, in whom the Nations are blessed. And we see, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. the blessing of an observed Covenant, and the curses of a broken Covenant are exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the fruit of the body to the sons and the daughters, <hi>v.</hi> 418.32. <hi>Job</hi> 21.19. <hi>Job</hi> 29.14. <hi>Job</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. And that this is not a New Testament dispensation, who can say? And that outward positive favours are bestowed on Infants, is clear. (1.) That Christ laid his hands on them and blessed them, making them a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed copy of the indwellers of his Kingdom. (2) The promises of the Covenant are made to them, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. (3.) They are clean and holy by Covenant holinesse, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. which cannot be meant of being born of the marriage-bed. For <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 11.16. saith the same of the Jews, root and branches, Fathers and Children: And no man dreamed that <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 11. intends to prove that the Jews shall be insert in again, because they are free of bastardie Father and sons. Now Infants understand no more any of rhese to be blessed by the laying on of the hands of Christ, and to be such as have title to the promises, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. and to be Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-wise holy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. then they understand Baptism. (4.) The same Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> is made with the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>I will be their God, and they shall be my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Which is Prophesied of the Gentiles under the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Ezek</hi> 11.17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Ezek</hi> 34.23, 24, 25. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.36, 37, 38, 39, 40. <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Hos.</hi> 1.10, 11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9, 10.

Now that were a strange eke and excellency of the New Testament Covenant above the Old, to forfeit, without farther processe, all Infants under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament

of all Covenant-right, which was due to them of old un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Covenant which the Lord calls <hi>faultie: Egypt shall be my people,</hi> except their 1. Infants. 2. And except their aged, and their non-Saints. (5.) Infants in the former Covenant had right by birth to the means of salvation, to be taught and Catechised in the Law of the Lord, because born of Covenanting Parents within the Visible Church, and so had title to Covenant-calling, and GODS Covenant-choising, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.4. as is clear, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. <hi>I know Abraham will command his Children and his houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, Exod.</hi> 20.10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6, 6, 7. <hi>And thou shall teach them diligently unto thy Children, Exod.</hi> 12<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 26, 27. <hi>Ps.</hi> 78.4, 5, 6. Now if Infants be without the Covenant as the Infants of Pagans, then they have no more Covenant-right to the hearing of the Gospel, and a treatie with Christ, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, then Pagans have. Its not enough to say their Fathers owe that much naturall compassion to their souls, as to teach them, it being a Parents duty; Yea, but what warrand hath a Father as a Father to make offer of a Covenant of Grace in the Name of GOD to one Pagan more then to another, since all are equally without the Covenant, if there be a Covenant-call warranted to them, where is the Fathers command to propone and ingadge the Covenanters consent, if the Children be Pagans? but as they have a right by birth to the call, they being born where the call soundeth, they must have some visible right to the Covenant it self, more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pagans. Its but of small weight to say that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>Paul</hi> expoundeth that in the New Testament, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed,</hi> only of the spirituall seed, such as <hi>Jacob,</hi> who was predestinated to Glory, not of those that are carnally descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of <hi>Abraham,</hi> otherwise it should follow, that these that are in the Covenant, might believe that they should be saved, though void of Faith and Repentance.<note place="margin">The place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6. vindicated from the unsound gloss of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers of Infant Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism.</note> 
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The purpose of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. is to Answer a sad Objection: if the Jews be cast off, and rejected of God, as <hi>Paul,</hi> by his extreame desire to have them saved, insinuates, then <hi>the Word of God takes no effect,</hi> and his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and choising of them for his people, takes no effect, <hi>v.</hi> 6.

according to the flesh: Others <hi>sons of promise,</hi> and chosen of God. Now the word of promise takes effect in the latter sort, to wit, in the chosen, and in the sons of promise, for they are not cast off of <hi>God,</hi> and so <hi>the Word of God takes effect, v.</hi> 6. (2.) But the truth is, if there be none Covenanted with God, but the chosen under the New Testament, then there is no such thing as an externall and visible Covenanting with <hi>God,</hi> under the New Testament, then must all the Nations, <hi>Isa.</hi> 2.1, 2.

And that, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>I will be your God, and ye shall be my people,</hi> under the New Testament, must infer, that all in Covenant under Christ must be spiritually in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the Visible Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and of all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. must be the invisible and chosen Church, and as many as are called, must be chosen, contrair to <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.14.

The speciall intent of <hi>God</hi> in sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the word of the Covenant must evidence this; he sends not the Gospel unto, and for the cause of one man, to bring him in, but to gather a Church and his elect ones, by a visibly and audibly Preached Covenant to a society, to a City; to <hi>Samaria.

The Lord in one <hi>Abraham,</hi> in one <hi>Cornelius,</hi> in one <hi>Jayler,</hi> (whom he effectually converts as far as we can gather from the Scriptures) choises the race, house, society, nation, and gives them a Covenant-holinesse, the mans being born where the call of <hi>God</hi> is, does the turn, as much as the faith of the Parent. For by the root is not necessarily meant the Physicall root the father. For <hi>Abraham</hi> was not the Physicall root and father,<note place="margin">The being born where the Gospel sounds, of that nation &amp; race, is the ground of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes as well as the faith of the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest parents</note> nor <hi>Cornelius</hi> of all the servants and friends in the house. But if a friend be in the house, or society, and professe the Gospel, he and his obtain right to Baptism and the means of salvation. But as touching real holinesse, it is not derived from a beleeving father, to make the son a beleever, Scripture and experience say the contrair.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If we speak of a passive right, if the <hi>Eunuch</hi> beleeve, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. and if such have received the Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive baptism, The <hi>Eunuch</hi> moves not the Question whether <hi>Philip</hi> should sin in baptizing him or not.

                  <hi>Acts</hi> 8. and that, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. to prove that only such should be baptized, who beleeve actually and are come to age: They prove that the Church sinneth, if they ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize any, but such as are predestinated to life and really beleeve. For the faith that <hi>Philip</hi> asked for, was reall, <hi>with all the heart,</hi> not as the faith of <hi>Simon Magus</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> And the faith, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. is real saving faith, that brings salvation; <hi>he that beleeves is saved.</hi> 2. It can not be visible faith only, for that is in <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> he doth visibly so beleeve and is baptized. Yet upon that faith he was not saved, being <hi>in the gall of bitternesse</hi> (3.) <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves not, is damned.</hi> The meaning must be, he that beleeves not savingly is damned: Or then he that beleeves not visibly, as <hi>Magus,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> is damned, but this is most false, for <hi>Peter</hi> beleeves not as <hi>Judas,</hi> and yet he is not damned: Or then the meaning must be, he that beleeveth both really, savingly, and also professedly and visibly, is saved. And that is true, but it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that none are to be baptized, but both real and visible belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. 4. If it be true that none are to be baptized but Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted ones, as <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. And if none be Covenanted ones under the New Testament, but real beleevers and such as are predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to life, as our Anabaptists teach from <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. then must the Church without warrant of the Word baptize <hi>Magus, Demas, Judas.</hi> (5.) Then must also all Judea, all the Generations of vipers baptized have been both real and visible beleevers, for they were all baptized, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.3, 4. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.5. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.7.21.

Paraeus, Calvin, Beza</hi>; and our Divines speak on these places against the auricular confession of all the huge multitude. (6.) It is a wonder that any man should dream that the Eunuch made a case of conscience, Acts 8. whether it was lawfull to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> to baptize, and not whether he himself did beleeve and could worthily receive the seal, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.36. here is water (saith he) <gap reason="foreign">

Nor 2. are all in Covenant, to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized: For such as are only really and invisibly in Covenant, and do make no profession of Christ at all, are not warrantably by the Church to be baptized. Only these whether old or young that are, <hi>tali modo visibili federati,</hi> such as professedly and visibly in Covenant, and called, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. are warrantably baptized. Hence they must be so in Covenant, as they be called by the word of the Covenant, for they cannot be baptized against their will, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.29.30.</p>

so.

Nay.

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But is not this an approven distinction, that persons are within the Covenant, either <hi>externally, professedly, visibly,</hi> or <hi>internally, really,</hi> or according to the intention of God? <hi>Ergo,</hi> such as are externally within the Covenant, are not really &amp; indeed within the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Adverbe (<hi>really</hi>) relates to the reall fruit of the fulfilled Covenant, and so such as are only externally within the Covenant,<note place="margin">How vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors are really with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, &amp; not really within it.</note> are not really within the Covenant, for God never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, nor intended to bestow the blessing Covenanted, nor grace to perform the condition of the Covenant upon them? But they are <hi>really</hi> Covenanted and engadged by their consented profession to fulfill the Covenant. And as the commands and threatnings of the Covenant of Grace lay on a reall obligation, upon such as are only externally in Covenant, either to obey or suffer, so the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the Covenant imposes an ingagement and obligation upon such to beleeve the promise, but some times, we say the promises of the Covenant of Grace are not <hi>really</hi> made to the Reprobate within the Visible Church, because God intends and decrees to, and for them, neither the blessing promised, nor the saving grace to fulfill the condition or to beleeve. And therefore these words are figurative, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. <hi>This is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, I will write my Law in their minds,</hi> &amp;c. that is, this is the speciall and principall Covenanted blessing, I will give them a new heart: which must not be called a simple pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, though a prediction it is, but it is also a real promise made absolutely to the elect, which the Lord fulfills in them: And this is called the Covenant. Because 1. they are no better then non-Covenanters upon whom the Lord bestowes not this part and blessing of the Covenant. 2. The truth is, the promise of a new heart is not made to the Visible Church, which is only Visible: but to the Elect and Invisible Church. And if Anabaptists shall expone these words, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. <hi>The promise of a new heart is made to you and to your children, upon condition that you and your children beleeve,</hi> which they cannot do untill first they have a new heart, its as good as <hi>Peter</hi> had said, <hi>God promiseth to you


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58986:55"/>
and to your children grace to beleeve, and a new heart to obey him, upon condition that you first beleeve.</hi> And that is,<note place="margin">The new heart is not promised to all, who ought to repent and to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</note> 
                  <hi>Gods promise to you to beleeve upon condition that ye beleeve,</hi> which is ridiculous, and therefore we cannot say that this promise of a new heart is made to all that are commanded to beleeve and repent and be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized. For Elect and Reprobate and all are under these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, if they be members of the Visible Church: But the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of a new heart is not made to all within the Visible Church.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>How then? Must the promise of a new heart be here excluded? And shall nothing be meant in the Word,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What is promised, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. whether a new heart be therein promised, or exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note>

Therefore because <hi>Peter</hi> speaks unto, and of a mixed multitude, Fathers, Children, Elect and Reprobate, who must first understand, the promise of life and forgivenesse is made <hi>to you. Ergo,</hi> all come to age, repent and be baptized. And because the promise is made to your children, therefore let them be baptized. And 3. the promise of new heart is not to be excluded, because there were in the company to whom, and of whom the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> speaks, many Elect, in whom the old Prophesie, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. was to be fulfilled; For he saith, <hi>The promise is made to as many as the Lord shall call</hi>; to the Gentiles, it were a sense too narrow, to exclude that promise, and therefore, as the great promise, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed</hi> (which chiefly is meant, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39.) requires not the same condition in fathers and infants, nor the same condition in fathers, <hi>wives, hewers of wood, Officers and Commanders, litle ones,</hi> and such as were not born, <hi>Deu.</hi> 29. with whom the Covenant is made. For the same faith in fath is and in infants, and faith working in the same duties cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of husbands, wives, Magistrates, and hewers of wood) so neither is the promise made the same way to fathers, children, <hi>Jews near hand,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles farre off,</hi> to Elect and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How can the promise of the Covenant, to write the Law in


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58986:56"/>
the heart, be made absolutely, and not to the Reprobate, but to the Elect only? For the Elect are only these to whom that promise is made, and yet the Reprobate are really in the Covenant of Grace, and the promise is made to them, as hath been said.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is no inconvenient that the Reprobate in the Visible Church,<note place="margin">Mercies of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, are not alike and the same way promised to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, to wit. Elect and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</note> be so under the Covenant of Grace, as some promises are made to them, and some mercies promised to them conditionally, and some reserved speciall promises <hi>of a new heart,</hi> and of <hi>perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi> belong not to them. For all the promises belong not the same way, to the parties visibly and externally, and to the parties internally and personally in Covenant with God. So the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth life and forgivenesse shall be given to these who are exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the Covenant, providing they beleeve, but the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth not a new heart and grace to beleeve, to these that are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly externally in Covenant. And yet he promiseth both to the Elect.</p>
               <p>Hence the Covenant must be considered two ways, <hi>in abstracto</hi> and formally,<note place="margin">The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace is considered two ways, <hi>in abstracto, &amp; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For because Christ is holy as root, head and Redeemer, the Jews once his Church Visible and to be so again, the branches are not really holy by faith, because all of them were not in Christ: But if all Jews and Gentiles, and also Infants who are Jews and Gentiles and parts of the body be baptized into the visible body, so are Infants.

               <p n="1">1. This under the New Testament is a new Covenant, and all the old shadows are abolished<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> The former is the old.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is with the <hi>house of Israel and Judah</hi> chosen persons, and so personall with single men. You shall not give a Nation, Kingdom, or Land, with which the Covenant internally is so made, as if all and every one, without exceptions, must <hi>know the Lord</hi> savingly (what may be the converted Jews case, whether the whole body of them, all and every one shall be visible, real, and personall Covenanters, as the place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. seems to say, I cannot determine) and all and every one be saved; for then must all the visible house of Israel be saved, and not the chosen only.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The visible externall Covenant was broken, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.32. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther personall and internall is never broken.</p>

There should be no need that Christ die, except only to satisfie for our breach of the Law, not to purchase new grace to us by his merits, and such a power should be no grace of Christ. If it be a supernaturall grace merited by Christ, then have Pagans, and all the Heathen that supernaturall inherent grace to beleeve in the Son of God, and yet the object thereof, the Gospel is not revealed to them, which is an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous dispensation not warranted by the Scripture, that the Lord should give a supernaturall power, to beleeve they know not what. 2. A supernaturall power to beleeve is saving grace, and a power to love Christ, and can saving grace be in Pagans or in any, and they know not of it? 3. Yea sins of Pagans, for which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, must be the Gospel-sins, for they cannot be Law-sins, for if all mankind be under the Covenant of grace, there can none at all be under the Law: For there can be none under the Covenant of Works, and also under the Covenant of Grace, for they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair dispensations, and contrair wayes of salvation.

But so 1. that grace saving proper to the Elect by this means is in the power of all Pagans, and all must be gifted with a power to purchase that grace proper to the Elect: That must be strange conquishing, we must all be made our own efficacious Redeemers, and Christ is a Saviour by merit, not by efficacy; For if this saving grace be infused, it is

If it be said that <hi>Christ</hi> dyed to merite the same generall power to all, but some make it ineffectuall, some not; This saith thus. 1. That Christs death might have it's fruit and effect, though all perish. 2. That Christ dyed to merite a far off, lubrick and possible venture of heaven, such as was the case of the first <hi>Adam.</hi> 3.

If conditionally, what can be the condition going before conversion, to wit, that we should be delivered from our vain conversation, so we be willing, before our conversion, to be delivered from our vain conversation. And shall not the Question recur concerning that condition? In a word they will have Christs death to buy Heaven, but not to buy faith, without which Heaven is impossible. Yea he no more bought to men a grace sweetly and strongly inclining the will to believe, then he bought such a grace to the damned devils.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is a word immediatly spoken by the Prophets, and Apostles, that is to be tryed, partly by the first Preaching the <hi>Lord</hi> made in <hi>Paradise,</hi> partly by the effects, that it converteth the soul, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.7. and smells of that same Majesty, and the divine power of another life, which is in the first Sermon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> this is <hi>Verbum Dei immediatum.</hi> But when God himself speaks in his own person to <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 22. to <hi>Moses<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Isaiah,</hi> the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that is <hi>Verbum Dei immediatissimum,</hi> the fountain-word; neither word nor speaker is to be tryed.

been some men, who have Prophesied facts to come, that fell out as they foretold, just as <hi>Isaiah, Elias,</hi> and other Prophets, then something is to be beleeved, that is not written, and such may have the Spirit, and yet no word of Scripture goes along with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Such men may have (I confesse) a Propheticall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but first, they were eminently holy and sound in the faith,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Prophesies that now are, and Scripturall Prophesies</note> and taught that the Catholick Church should beleeve nothing, nor practise nothing, but what is warranted by the Word.

               <p n="2">2. What these men of God foretold, is a particular fact concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a man, what death he should die, or a Nation, or a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, such a man shall be eternally saved, but no <hi>dogma fidei,</hi> nor any truth that lays bands on the Catholick Church to believe that to the end of the world, as all Scripturall truths do, and a doubt it is, if we are to beleeve these, in the individuall circumstances of fact, <hi>sub periculo peccati,</hi> upon hazard of sinning against God, we may, I judge, without sin suspend belief, and yeeld charity to the speaker.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If any object, the Prophets did foretell particular facts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the death of <hi>Ahab,</hi> the birth of <hi>Josiah,</hi> which concerned particular persons: I, but they so were the maters of fact (as the crucifying of <hi>Christ</hi> was a mater of fact) as also they did by the intent of the Holy Ghost contain Historicall, Morall and dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally divine Instructions, so that the whole Catholick Church must believe them, with certainty of divine faith,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, of what is truth, and what is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or not lawful, and revelations of facts, what shall come to passe, and what not.</note> they being written and spoken for our Instruction, and they sin who believe not.</p>

We speak now of the right that a Believer hath by Evangelick works to justification and life, as contradistinguished from the merits of Christ, this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on saith that a man is justified by Evangelick doing, because God hath made the like promise, and the like <hi>jus</hi> and right by promise, to doing Evangelick, that he made to Law-doing, if Christs me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits be added to qualifie Evangelick works, to adde to them the worth that they have, then Christs merits must give life eternall by way of merit, or a vertue of meriting condignly to our Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick doing, as Papists say, and so Christ hath made us saviours and redeemers of our selves, and this is a right to life <hi>ex condigno</hi> more then <hi>Adams</hi> most perfite Law-obedience had. 2. The Covenant of Grace commanding faith, doeth by this opinion command all that the Law of Works doeth, but in an Evangelick way, that they be done sincerely: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it must forbid all sin which the Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids; But the Law forbids not only unbelief, finall unbelief, but all the works of the flesh: Also Christ must come <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="6">6. (It is only beleeving but lively and not dead, not a naked assent, which was counted to him for righteousnesse) and <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. he was thereby justified; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> are well reconciled. And the faith here excluded must be a dead faith, not a lively faith and a true faith, as the body without the soul is a true body and hath the nature of a true body, though it be no living body. So (say they) the faith that <hi>Iames</hi> excludes is a true faith, when as it is evident, it is no more true faith then the faith of Devils and Hypocrites. 3. It is false by the <hi>Papists</hi>

               <p>IT may appear that Christ suffered not for any sin which is onely against the Gospel, such as finall unbeleef: <hi>If any sins be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in any other respect as against the Gospel only, then Christ was not to suffer for any such sin so considered, for where no death is threatened, none is explicitely due, and where it is not so due to the sinner, nor should have been execute upon him, there it could not have been due to Christ nor executed upon him, For the Gospel threateneth not death to any sin, but finall unbeleef and rebellion (and for that Christ never died) therefore Christ died not for any sin as against the Gospel, nor suffered that which is no where threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened.</hi> But this is most doubtsome and cannot well stand. Its true that <hi>Christ suffered not for finall unbeleef,</hi> it being the proper sin of some reprobates, to wit, of such as hear the Gospel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.21, 24. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.7, 8. But it seems against all Scripture that Christ should die for these, for whose sins he dies not: And so that 1. Christ should half and part the sins of the Reprobate, and the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, I judge shall not admit that <hi>Christ bare in his own body, on the tree,</hi> some sins of the Reprobate, to wit, all their sins against the Law, <hi>absolutely,</hi> or <hi>conditionally,</hi> and he that bears not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>absolutely,</hi> or <hi>conditionally</hi> their other sins against the Gospel,


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:58986:101"/>
to wit,<note place="margin">Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not for some sins of reprobates, and not for others.</note> their finall unbeleef and rebellion, for Christ was wounded and bruised for the transgressions and iniquities of these for whom he died; He must then have been wounded for some of their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, and not wounded for other of their transgressions. And so the sins of the Reprobates, are divided between Christs satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon the Crosse, and their own satisfaction in Hell: But he suffered (one may say) <hi>conditionally</hi> only for the Reprobates sins against the Law upon the Crosse, if they beleeve, not otherwise? <hi>Ans.</hi> The same reall satisfaction conditionally that he performed on the Crosse, for the Elect, the same (say the Authors) he performed for the Reprobate, <hi>conditionally,</hi> if either beleeve, but because the one beleeves, it is accepted for payment for them, and the other beleeves not, it is not accepted for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As there is a satisfaction performed for some sins, not for all, not for finall unbeleef, that sin then must be in the same case with the sin of the fallen <hi>Angels,</hi> there is no sacrifice for it, nor is Christs death applicable by divine ordination to purge men from finall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleef more then to purge Devils from any sins they commit. 3. The same incorruptible price of the blood of the Lamb that is given to ransome all from wrath, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi> is given to buy all, for whom <hi>Christ died, from their vain conversation,</hi>

If Christ died for all, not because they did will and beleeve, but that they might will and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; and if <hi>Jesus suffered without the Camp, that he might san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the people by his own blood,</hi> Heb. 13.12.

                  </note> by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, to save all and every one of mankinde, Christian and Pagan, so they actually believe: For it cannot be said, that <hi>Christ</hi> hath died to make all mankinde saveable, upon condition of actuall faith to receive <hi>Christ</hi> preached: for so Infants, to whom <hi>Christ</hi> preached is in no tollerable sense applicable, that way, by any ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, if they actually believe, shal be no parts of the world, &amp; they must be excluded from Baptism.

seems to me physically impossible, that there is such a thing as the <hi>Indians</hi> worship Satan under such a name and in such rites, if I never heard of the <hi>Indians,</hi> or of their God, or their worship: So neither can they worship Christ in a Gospel-way, who never heard of him. Its impossible to beleeve a <hi>non ens,</hi> Christ offered in the Gospel is very nothing and so not applicable to thousands by any decree of God. 3. This is not written in Scripture. God hath decreed that Christ be Preached and life be offered actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to all and every one of all and every Nation under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and this opinion saith that Christ died and satisfied of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Justice for the sins of all and every one of all and every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under heaven, except for finall unb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God fulfills his decrees irresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stibly: But he never sent the Preached Gospel to as many as these Authors say he died for.<note place="margin">This is false, <hi>that God hath decreed that Christ in the preached Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation may be offered to all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, old &amp; young, of all and every nation in all generations, upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of actu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>all beleeving</hi>
                  </note> Nor can they themselves teach any such thing: Nor is this true, <hi>God hath decreed that Christ in the Preached Gospel and salvation may be offered to all and every one, old and young, of all and every Nation, in all Generations, upon condition of actuall beleeving.</hi> And yet for all these, without exception, Christ died, say they. For not to say, God never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that such may be offered to infants of Pagans, for whom they say Christ died. To make a thing that physically is possible, the object of a decree of God, we must say that God hath decreed to give the gift of tongues to all Professours and Pastours to speak to all and every Nation in their own Language, and to make an offer of Christ: For there be ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It shall not help to say that Christians should travell to all Countreys and learn their Tongues, that so they may commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the Gospel; and it is their sin they do not so. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath decreed that the Gospel may be offered and Christ applicable. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1.

Did ever the Apostles to whom the Lord gave the gift of the tongues, go to this Nation and not to this, but by the call of the Spirit, to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> not to <hi>Bythinia,</hi> Act. 16? Is there no call of <hi>God</hi> now required for spreading of the Gospel? Some Nations would kill them, some would persecute Christians to death and not receive them: in the mean time, many for whom Christ died, perish. 3. Show from Scripture that it is the duty of Christians to mix themselves with all Nations, and to learn their Language, and that they sin in not doing so.

               <head>CHAP. XXII. The differences in the promise of the Covenants.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> WHat is the speciall difference of the promise of the two Covenants?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is known that only life eternall is promised in the Law, if a right to the things of this life was promised to <hi>Adam,</hi> it is like he behoved to compleat his course of obedience, and merit a right legall to the herbs and fruit of the earth, beside the right he had by gift of Creation, <hi>ex dono Creatoris, non jure operum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 2. There was no promise made to <hi>Adam</hi> of perseverance, and so no promise made to him of influences to work in <hi>Adam</hi> to will and to do; so the influences by which he obeyed was, <hi>purum donum Creatoris,</hi> a meer gift of the Creator, not a gift of either the grace of <hi>Christ,</hi> or a promised grace, though in a large sense, it may be called a grace, or <hi>donum gratis datum:</hi> For <hi>God</hi> gave that influence upon no obligation. Now that it was not a grace promised is evident by <hi>Adams</hi> fall: for <hi>God,</hi> who is true, fulfills his promises. 2. <hi>Augustine</hi> and our Divines teach, <hi>Dedit Deus posse ut vellet, non velle ut posset,</hi> a power to stand, but not the gift of actuall perseverance. If any say that the <hi>Lord</hi> promised to <hi>Adam</hi> perseverance conditionally (which in one sense is true, in another false) if he pleased, in that he gave to him all necessaries required for actuall standing. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This is to teach that perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance was promised the same way, in the Covenant of Works, that <hi>Arminius</hi> saith it is promised in the Covenant of Grace, and that the free-will was absolute lord of standing and falling, and to deny <hi>God</hi> to be the nearest cause of our standing and persevering in either, the one or the other, and to bid us first and last sacrifice to our own free-will. 2. Willing perseverance actuall cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised conditionally:<note place="margin">Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance was not promised to <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </note> for the question should be, Upon what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition doth the <hi>Lord</hi> promise to work in <hi>Adam</hi> actual perseverance, if he should be willing to persevere? But the question shall remain, whether that willingnesse to persevere, since it is the greatest part, if not whole perseverance, be promised or not; If it be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,


<pb n="195" facs="tcp:58986:107"/>
the contrair whereof they hold, if it be promised conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the question shall recur, what shall be the condition, and another condition then the willingnesse of the will to persevere cannot be given, and so the argument shall rise against it self, and the issue must be, <hi>God</hi> gave to <hi>Adam</hi> actuall perseverance, if he should be willing to persevere, that is, he gives to <hi>Adam</hi> perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, if he give him perseverance; for willingnesse to persevere is perseverance, or a very large part thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But persevering grace and so influence of grace to persevere is promised in the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.35. that they shall continue in Covenant, more <hi>sure then the night and the day.</hi> Jer. 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts,</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>that they shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me.</hi> The meaning cannot be, I will give them a power never to depart from me, if they will: For so nothing is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in <hi>Christ</hi> to the second <hi>Adams</hi> heirs, then to <hi>Adam</hi> and the <hi>Angels</hi> that fell, for the like, say they, was promised to them. And 2. If notwithstanding of that fear both promised and put in the heart, and in the will, yet lubrick free-will may stand or fall and remain indifferent to either, then the sense shall be thus, I will make an everlasting Covenant, <hi>I will put my fear in their heart, by which they may either depart from me, and turn apostates, or not depart from me, but persevere:</hi> But so the Covenant, made with <hi>Adam</hi> and the fallen Angels, should be an everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and yet it was broken. For the Image of <hi>God</hi> of it self incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Adam</hi> and the fallen Angels never to depart from <hi>God:</hi> For sure, <hi>Adams</hi> fear, being a part of that Image, which sanctified his affections, inclined him (but not undeclinably and immutably) not to depart from <hi>God,</hi> and not to hearken to the lying Serpents suggestions. But it is not that new Covenant-fear promised and given in the second ADAM, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.39, 40.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That these influences were purchased by <hi>Christs</hi> death is clear, because they are the nearest causes of our actuall believing and coming to <hi>Christ,</hi> of faith and perseverance that are given freely, and repentance and faith are given of <hi>Christ,</hi> Acts. 5.31. Zech. 12.10. 2 Tim. 2.25. Phil. 1.29. Ephes. 2.1, 2, 3. Ezek. 36.26, 27. Eph. 1.17, 18, 19, 20. John 6.44, 45.</p>
               <p n="5">5. So obedience to the Covenant of Works was <hi>Adams</hi> own.

(2.) And came from his concreated self (the Image of God that was his own) by a common influence, and neither was the Image of <hi>God,</hi> nor the influences of <hi>God</hi> acts of free grace, or the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of grace properly so called.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Adam</hi> had a Law-claim to the Crown without sin, if he had continued in obedience,<note place="margin">The obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of <hi>Adam</hi> only a duty, not a promised benefite, our new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is both a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and a promised benefite.</note> and did merite <hi>ex pacto</hi> life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, our new Covenant obedience in habituall and actuall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance is so a duty, that it is also promised and a benefite meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us by the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> whereas <hi>Adams</hi> obedience was <hi>purum officium, non officium promissum,</hi> as our Gospel-obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence in obedience distinguish two. 1. The nature of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. 2. The worth and excellencie of obedience.

But Christs obedience intrinsecally from the excellent dignity of the person hath a meriting vertue. 2.

As to the former, saving faith is of that nature that it is apt to endure, it hath a sort of immortality, so the promise <hi>in titulo &amp; jure,</hi> is made to that faith only which is of that nature that it must endure to the end, and the promise of life and remission is not made to a saving faith under the accident of enduring to the end, or for the years, suppon thirty or fourty years, or eight hundred years, or above, that <hi>Adam</hi> or the Patriarchs lived in the state of beleeving, for a faith of some hours only shall save the repenting thief as well as a faith of many years.

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58986:113"/>
but that is by accident, in regard of the right to life and because God hath commanded persevering in faith, life is given only in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session to such a faith as endures, but we cannot say that the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall endurance and existence of faith for so many years doth save and justifie, as the living so many years makes a Child an heir to a great estate, for his being born the eldest son, makes him his fathers heir.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> WHether is Christs Righteousnesse imputed and made ours, because we believe and apprehend it ours; or do we believe, because it is ours first before we believe?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A twofold imputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of <hi>Christ,</hi> one legall, another E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelick.</note>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is a twofold imputation, one legall, another which for Doctrines cause we call application or reall (though the legall imputation be also reall; but not to us as the former) the Lords <hi>act of laying the iniquity of us all upon Christ,</hi> Isa. 53.6. and the Lords making <hi>him sin for us,</hi> that is a sacrifice for sin, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. evinces necessarily the truth of this, the former imputation. For 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.</hi> If it be expounded of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall reconciliation of persons, it may say something, for the other imputation, but the other imputation is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Abraham beleeved God, and it was counted to him for righteousnesse,</hi> v. 7. <hi>Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered,</hi> v. 8. <hi>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not sin,</hi> v. 9. <hi>Faith</hi> (that is, that which faith beleeved, as hope is put for the thing hoped for, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24. <hi>was imputed to</hi> Abraham <hi>for righteousnesse,</hi> though <hi>Gomarus</hi> give another exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wit, that by faith or the act of beleeving we obtain this to


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58986:114"/>
be reputed righteous, and it suits better with the Text. And as to the former imputation, <hi>God</hi> could not in justice wound Christ for our transgressions, nor bruise him for our iniquities, nor could the Lord break him, nor <hi>deliver him to the death for us all,</hi> except God had both made him the sinner, that is, imputed and reckoned him the sinner in Law (for intrinsecally and inherently he was not the sinner but <hi>holy, harmlesse,</hi> &amp;c.) and laid our debts upon him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.6. and except he had been willing to have been coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the sinner, and had said (<hi>thou hast given me a body, here am I, to do thy will,</hi> Psal. 40.7. Heb. 10.6, 7.) this reckoning of Christ to be the sinner is not only in the eternall decree, but also a laying of our iniquities upon him in time, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.6. or a dealing with him in Law in punishing him as the sinner. And 2. by using the humane nature as an instrument of our Redemption on the Crosse. <hi>Antinomians</hi> take this imputing of our sins to Christ,<note place="margin">The mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians</hi>

But the Scripture is so far from ascribing Justification to any but to a beleever, that it saith <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was imputed to him for righteousnesse. Now the faith of multitudes for whom Christ died when he suffered on the Crosse, is a very nothing: Many are not born, and a nothing or a <hi>non ens</hi> cannot be counted for righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>It is to be observed that payment made by the surety absolveth the debter, so as the Law, except it be the generall Law of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, requireth no act of love, of faith, of service from the debter, nor doth the Law of suretyship in its essence and nature require that the Creditor, <hi>&amp; sub eo titulo</hi> should pay the homage of faith,<note place="margin">

                  </note> indeed when the Creditor is both the Creditor and the offended Party, and also the supream Law-giver GOD, he may require of the captives the obedience of faith. So would justice, which saith, we should hurt none, give to every man his own, presse, that the debter repay to the surety, so far as he is able to make up his losses, but to pay the obedience of faith as a part of the ransome due to offended Justice, is no Gospel-Law, nor any part thereof, nor can it bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now except the meaning had been, we are not under the Law, that is, the Laws dominion and the Laws condemning power, there had been no place for such an Objection, nay, nor any shadow; but the true Objection is, we are not under the Law to be thereby condemned and eternally punished, therefore what is the hazard of sin? We may sinne at will, there is no fear of hell. <hi>Paul</hi> answers not from that evill of servile fear that followeth sin, but from the woefull ingratitude to our ransome-payer.<note place="margin">The <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon is answered by him.</note> O then we should not be under Christ and the directing light and rule of our <hi>Lord Ransomer,</hi> if we sin at will, but still servants and slaves to sin and so not redeemed, by which we gather that there is two things in the Law. 1.

               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> VVHerein stands the eternity of the Covenant of Grace? And what other properties there be of the Covenant?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How the Covenant of works is eternall.</note>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Law and Covenant of Works is a rule of everlasting righteousnesse, and so may be called an everlasting righteousnesse containing precepts of the Law of nature intrinsecally good, such as to know love, fear, trust in him as the only true God: and in this sense it is an eternall Covenant.</p>
               <p>But 1. it is not eternall in the positives of the second, and fourth, and fifth Commands, the way of worship, the means, as Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Sabbath, Magistracie, and such like, which are not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the life to come,<note place="margin">How the Covenant of works is not eternal</note> and so neither faith nor hope in God through Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24, 25. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. nor a Temple, nor Ordinances, nor the Kingdom of Christ as now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spenced, are to be the binding rule for eternity to such as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federats of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.22, 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. though more of the smell and remnants of the Covenant of Grace, of the Lamb, of praises to him who was slain, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9, 11, 14. be in the life to come, then of the Law-Covenant, in regrad of our standing in a state of glory for evermore by the Mediator, to keep the nature in an eternall union, <hi>for evermore,</hi> by the Lord Christ his being cloathed with our nature, glorified <hi>for ever,</hi> Rev. 3.21.

As 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1, 2. or of praying that our faith fail not, when winnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as Luk. 22.31, 32. In a word there is a mediation of the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing reign for the standing of the glorified nature, and a mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the reconciling of, and interceeding for of sinners. The latter must cease when the Kingdom is given up by the Sonne to the Father, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. The former is eternall and shall never cease.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Law as a possible and standing way of justifying and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sinners is not eternall, but is now ceased to all flesh, the Man <hi>Christ</hi> only excepted,<note place="margin">Other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Covenant of Works, and that of Grace.</note> but the Covenant of Grace stands as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way under heaven, by which sinners may be saved, and after the Covenant of Grace there is no dispensation, which <hi>Libertines</hi> and <hi>Familists</hi> call more spirituall without Ordinances and a way as they speak of <hi>all spirit,</hi> of <hi>pure spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Covenant of Grace is eternall, in regard in it there is promised actuall grace, and continuall influences of grace from the Head <hi>Christ,</hi> the High Priest, to keep the confederats in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and in perseverence to the end. And no such influences either for the habit of grace or for the continuated acts thereof, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in the Covenant of Works, in regard <hi>Adam</hi> a man, and poor men in him do undertake to obey. Whereas Christ-Man binds and undertakes as head Covenanter and Surety for all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der confederats, and for sinners in the Covenant of Grace. Which difference is much to be observed, between the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace: And for that cause the Covenant of Works is, 1. more independent, and requires more of mans strength and less grace then the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It stands more by precepts, lesse by promises, having only one promise of a reward and hyre to the obeyer, and consists all of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, the other though it want not precepts, especially, it is his command that we believe in the Son of <hi>God,</hi> yet stands most by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and this Covenant gets the name of a promise or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 3.25. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:58986:119"/>3. The Covenant of Works hath more of hyre, more of man, of nature, of earning and working, and more of mans Covenant, where he binds for himself, and the other partie for himself, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mutuall help of any of the confederate parties.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Covenant of Grace is, thus, also eternall, in that the buried and dead parties <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitie</hi> of the Covenant of Grace in the life to come.</note> 
                  <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> are still in the Covenant of Grace, and there remains a Covenant-union between Christ and their rotten flesh sleeping in the dust, which is not an union by faith, or by any actings obedientiall of dead men, as is most evident, if we compare our Saviours words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.32. with the Lord speaking out of the Bush to <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 3.6. and <hi>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living,</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> is the rising of the body promised in the Covenant of Works, nor is there a standing Law-Covenant between the Lord and dead <hi>Abraham</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the condition of faith from buried men. Onely there is a warrand to say that the Covenant is everlasting<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> because it goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond time, and stands with the dead in Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.32. (2.) Because two great promises of the Covenant, the rising of the body and life everlasting, are fulfilled after time is ended, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.38, 39. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.14, 16, 17. and adde to this the publick own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and confessing of the Saints before the Father and the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; which is publick remission and declared justification before the world of Elect Men and Angels, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.32. (3.) Because after all these, to walk among them as their <hi>God</hi> and dwell among them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.15, 16, 17. when <hi>they are cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in white Robs, and are before the throne serving him night and day,</hi> and that the Lord should be their God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7. after they have overcome all temptations, is fulfilled eternally in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Now for God to walk among a people and be their <hi>God</hi> is to be a Covenanting <hi>God</hi> to them, as is evident from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.11, 12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.38. <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.6.</p>

alway, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14. and fears and trembles <hi>at the Lord and his goodnesse,</hi> Hos. 3.5. A Godly heart trembles more for fear of grace and the debt of grace, then of justice and wrath; and fears sin more, as it is against the bands of grace, and against Christ, and Gospel-love who can save, then as it is against Law the Law-giver, and him who eternally destroyes. And so the aw of heaven hath a stronger impression then the terrour and aw of hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. How can the fear of falling away, and the faith of perseverance absolutely promised and absolutely given, consist to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How fear of law-fear acts upon a beleever.</note>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Law-fear of falling away, and the Gospel faith of persevering are not consistent. The fear legall of the least sinne is a fear of hell and of eternall wrath to be irrecoverably inflicted, but because the person is under grace, the beleever cannot fear this fear, except the Law-fear be letten out against him as a temptation, but it is not his oblidged duty so to fear.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Law-fear upon a beleever is conditionall, and not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, as he fears hell and falling away, <hi>jure,</hi> as his deserving, if <hi>God</hi> should enter in judgement with him, and if he were not in CHRIST: But he is oblidged to a Gospel-faith which layes hold on Christ, righteousnesse, and deliverance from condemnation, and if <hi>Christ</hi> and interest in him be hid from him, and nothing on but Law-fear, that is a triall, not a duty of Law-fear. <note n="*" place="margin">So the faith of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> &amp; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> their Son <hi>shal be great shal sit<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> in the Thron. of</hi> DAVID <hi>his father &amp; shal raign o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the house of Jacob for ever,</hi> Luk. 1.32, 33. did wel consist with that holy and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedientiall fear of <hi>flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> for fear that <hi>Herod</hi> shuld mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that hopefull young <hi>King</hi> in his cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 2.</note> But there is a Godly<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Law-fear, or a Gospel-Law-fear, which is a Godly horrour conditionall for that which is never to be inflicted, but yet according to deserving may be inflicted, and this is the terrour of the Lord, which breedeth Gospel perswasion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. and so may well stand with Gospel-faith and assurance of deliverance from falling away and of being stablished and confirmed to the end. As a child in the fathers arm threatened to be cast over a sharp Rock in the Sea, may have horrour and fear, and cry out for fear, and yet beleeve so his fathers compassion as he will not throw him in the Sea, because the threatning is ordained not to be exercised, but that the child may so much the more thrust his arms about his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers neck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. What is the best victory over temptations from such fears?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:58986:120"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> As in all temptations, so here,<note place="margin">What is to be done under ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> overcoming is attended with precious promises, which are to be read, <hi>Rev. c.</hi> 2.7.17.26, 27, 28. <hi>c.</hi> 3.5.12.21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>For 1. Feavers of the Law that have no kindly cools, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting by the promises of the Gospel, tend not to the strengthning of the life of <hi>God,</hi> but only when they leave a standing self loathing, and loving of Christ.</p>

But wee had the sentence of death in our selves,</hi> do prevail to the being taught of <hi>God, not to trust in our selves, but in God who quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the dead</hi>: For here there comes reall strength from fighting: As he who, by strength of nature, lives and convalesceth after a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning boatch and strong pestilence, goes through pest-houses and is never infected again. So the worthies by faith who overcame strong temptations, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. to the end, keep the fields and prevail till death.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Godly fear of self-weaknesse and trembling at sin which may darken the feelings of received mercies and sweet influences addeth strength. Something of that is here, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. <hi>when I am weak, then am I strong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. A fixed peace in assurance of deliverance from condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and quietnesse in beleeving pardon and righteousnesse in <hi>Christ,</hi> ought alwayes to be, as touching the state of Justification: for the questioning of this in a beleever, if <hi>Antinomians</hi> will yeeld to truth, is contrair to faith, and no warrantable assurance.

It is sinfull doctrine to say that CHRIST takes away this sense of sin.

And in some it is the naturall conscience accusing and challenging after sin is committed; now CHRIST came not to extirpate conscience, nor the power of feeling and discerning the obligation to wrath, that the conscience apprehendeth after sin is committed, nor the legall evill deserving of sin, nor the contrariety between it and the Law. 2. Christ by his death gives repentance and mourning for sin, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. <hi>Eze.</hi> 12.10, 11. (3.) Christ commends this, Jer. 31.18. <hi>I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself.</hi> 2 King. 22.19. <hi>Because thine heart was tender â€” and thou hast weept before me, I have also heard thee, saith the Lord.</hi> Luk. 7.44. <hi>She hath washed my feet with tears.</hi> (4.)

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What place hath Christs righteousnesse here?</p>

               <p>Now the active obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce of <hi>Christ</hi> falls under a twofold considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 1.

As dying for us.<note place="margin">Christs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation and death cannot be a fruit of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors death.</note> 3. As his satisfaction is made ours, are of diverse considerations. For if <hi>God</hi> out of free love sent his Son in the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. and if he, out of free-grace that separateth the race of man from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, took upon him the nature of man, to wit, of <hi>Abraham, and not the nature of Angels,</hi> Heb. 2.16. Then sure by the merits of Christs death it cannot come that God came in the flesh to save sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. For the effect cannot but come from the cause; but the cause flowes not from the effect, nor is the effect, to wit, Christs Incarnation and his dying, the cause of that love and free-grace of God which moved God to send his Son in the flesh, but posterior un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and latter then that love: for because he loved us, he sent his Son in the flesh to die for us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This cannot then be true (<hi>Christ by his dying for the Elect, merited and deserved, that God should be made Man for us</hi>) for this should be true also (<hi>by the blood of Christ, and by the redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption that is in Christ, God sent his Son in the flesh, and the Son took on him our nature, by the blood of the Covenant</hi>) nor can this be true <hi>(Christ merited by his death, that he should die for us)</hi> for so it should be true, that Christ by his blood shed his blood for us: Where as because he loved his Church freely, he gave himself for her. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Who loved me and gave himself for me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. Hence 1. though grace be the cause of grace, as because he of grace ordained us to glory, therefore of grace he calls, and because of free-grace he calls, of free-grace he carries on his work, and gives of grace, perseverance and glory. Yet there is a fountain-grace of election to glory, which hath no cause nor merit, not the merit of Christ for its cause; but is the cause of causes and of Christs merits. As one fire may produce another, but the element of fire was not produced by another element of fire, but by God in creation. And one Vine Tree brings forth another, but the first Vine Tree was created by the Lord only.</p>

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:58986:127"/>
even a right to remission and life eternall, so they beleeve. Well then, it is the same right conditional to life and pardon which is purchased to the Elect: yea this must be purchased whether they believe or not. Then there is no more in the kind of the Law-right to Redemption and life eternall and remission of sins purchased to <hi>Peter,</hi> then to <hi>Judas</hi> or <hi>Cain</hi>; And therefore hath <hi>Christ</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed as much tender love in dying for the Reprobate as in dying for his friends. And <hi>Christ</hi> saith there is no greater love then this, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.13. As for the efficacious intention of applying of <hi>Christs</hi> death to <hi>Peter,</hi> when as <hi>God</hi> had no such intention of applying it to <hi>Judas,</hi> that is an act of eternall predestination, not a fruit of Christs death, and as for the grace of beleeving, it was purchased to all, Reprobate and Elect, only the Lord applyes not his death, and bestowes not the grace of beleeving upon the Reprobate, but for right to faith, to remission, to perseverance, to life eternall, this right must be purchased, but faith it self is never bestowed upon them. But there is a ransome of blood given for faith, and purchased by CHRISTS merit: But CHRIST is never called the Head of all men, Elect and Reprobate, <hi>but the Head of the Body the Church,</hi> Eph. 1.22. Col. 1.18. And whereas the Head hath merited faith to the Reprobate, and that absolutely (for a condition is not possible) he should bestow it absolutely, else there is no seriousnesse in the command of beleeving. And since faith is no meritorious cause of right to remission and life eternall, nor a cause in part, or in whole, of our compleat and actuall reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it may well be said, that they all are compleatly reconciled, pardoned, justified, washen in Christs blood, when nothing is wanting, that compleats the nature of remission and justification, for faith is only a condition applying, not a cause buying, nor sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying for us, and no cause giving in part, or in whole, any new right.</p>

As to the first, <hi>Adams</hi> sin is ours really and truely, not so much because it is ours,<note place="margin">Three parts of original sin.</note> as because it is imputed to be ours by <hi>God,</hi> who so contrived the Law of Works, as it should be made with <hi>Adam,</hi> not as a single father, but with <hi>Adam</hi> as a publick person represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all man, and having our common nature as a father both by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Law, which came from the meer free-will of God.</p>

And <hi>Christ</hi> hath <hi>verÃ¨ &amp; propriÃ¨,</hi> truelie and properly died for them. Nor 4. is it enough to say that Christ had a speciall intention in dying for the Elect to give them faith, but he had no such intention in dying for the Reprobate. But hence it follows that <hi>Christ</hi> as properly and truely died for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate as for the Elect, as touching the nature and intention of his dying; and that he offered as sufficient a ransome for the one as for the other, and that is a meer possible ransome, but as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the intention to apply effectually, or no effectuall intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to apply the death, there's the difference.

It is not enough to coyn two intentions in <hi>Christ-God-Man</hi> dying, and give us Scripture for one of them only, and bid us take the other on trust. 2. Nor is it enough to say all these places speak of Christs effectuall dying for his Elect only. For 1. it is not truely nor properly said that Christ effectually died for the Elect only, for he effectually died for no man by this way, because he died only to make salvation possible to all, so as they might perish for ever, notwithstanding of his dying for them: So the efficacy of dying is in Christs intention, and application. Now efficacy of intention and efficacy of appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation are both extrinsecall to his laying down his life. 2. The place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. cannot be expounded by them of only the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: For it speaks (as they expone it) of <hi>Christ</hi> dying for all <hi>that were dead,</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 14. and these they say are Elect and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.

This would say that the Reprobate were to beleeve that <hi>Christ</hi> died to save them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving purchased life to them, and to believe that he died not to save them all for whom he died, because they are not to believe he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to purchase faith by his death, or grace to beleeve, without which salvation is impossible: it cannot be said that <hi>God</hi> absolutely intended to save them, whether they beleeve or not, even while as there is such a decree in <hi>God,</hi> because he hath decreed both the end and the means, to wit, having ordained for them salvation, and having ordained for them faith; nor is there any such decree in God, toward any but the Elect only, therefore this conditionall decree (if all and every one beleeve, all and every one shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) can infer no love of <hi>God</hi> through <hi>Christ</hi> to the persons of all and every one to have them saved, more then this can infer a love of saving all and every one, to be in God or to have been in the Lord, before the fall of <hi>Angels,</hi> and men (if all and every one of

                  <hi>Angels</hi> and men shall perfectly, without sin to the end, keep the Law, then all Angels, all men Elect and Reprobate shall be saved eternally.) Now no man found in judgement, can say this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall can infer that <hi>God</hi> had a good will to save some Angels, not to save others: More then this (if all and every man beleeve in Christ they shall be saved) can infer that <hi>God</hi> hath a good-will to save Reprobate men, and not fallen Angels. In a word, no simple conditionall propositions can infer the desire or good will of God to the persons of men or to have the things done, except God effectually work the condition: As this <hi>(if all fulfill the Law perfectly, men and Angels, and all men shall be saved by the Law)</hi> cannot infer that <hi>God</hi> hath a good will to the persons of all Angels and all men to justifie and save them all, without exception, by the works of the Law; the contrair whereof he decreed. For this connex proposition may stand true with the salvation of all Angels, of all men, of no Angels, or no men, according as the Lord shall be pleased of his good pleasure and free grace to work, or not to work the condition of moving the will of Angels and men to keep the Law.

That there is a wise connexion between means and end, obedience legall and life, faith and life, according to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving will of <hi>God,</hi> and yet neither means nor end may ever come to passe or fall out, and neither means nor end may ever be decreed of <hi>God</hi> to fall out: Yea God may decree absolutely that none of the extreams shall exist as God decrees (<hi>if</hi> Zedekiah <hi>shall yeeld to the King of Babylon, Jerusalem shall not be burnt</hi>) and yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his decree or will of purpose the Lord hath decreed that the yeelding of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> and the safety of the idolatrous Citie should not come to passe, but the contrair.

If it be his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and revealed will that the Gospel be Preached to all Nations, every age, they grievously sin, who Preach not the Gospel to the <hi>Brasilians</hi> and <hi>Antipods,</hi> whether they can speak in their Language or not. And if the Doctrine of the Covenant of its own nature may so be Preached to all Nations, without exception, in every difference of time, then must all the Nations of the earth, in all differences of time, be in a capacity to be a Covenanted people of God, the Church of Christ, the Vineyard of the Lord, his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, the Spouse of Christ, his Body, his Called, and Chosen flock. For to have the Doctrine of the Covenant fixedly Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Nation, and Christ offered to them, is to be the planted Vineyard of the Lord, for to Preach to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> fixedly, they willingly hearing, is indeed the Lords entering in Covenant with <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and his choising them to be his confederate people, and the Lords planting a Vineyard, and building a Wine-presse in it, and setting up a Ministry therein; and therefore the Lord was not in Covenant with them before. Indeed to Preach the Word simply to scoffers who reject it, and that occasionally in the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, so as there is no sort of accepting of the Covenant nor any fixed Ministry there, is not a renewing of the Covenant with them, nor does it presuppose a Covenant before made with them. 2. It


<pb n="246" facs="tcp:58986:134"/>
is against the wisdome of God, that 1. there should be such a band of love the greatest love that ever was, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.13. lying upon all mankind, <hi>Brasilians, Americans,</hi> binding them to thankfull Gospel-obedience that Christ died for them, yet this obligation of the greatest love is neither written in their heart, as the Law of nature, nor is it ever revealed to them that they are under so much love by Covenant. 2. How can the Lord say I choosed you, O Israel, among all the people of the earth, and entred in Covenant with you and your seed only. For 1. there is no need of a new e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishing of the conditionall Gospel-Covenant, for it was establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with Israel, and with all the world before he choosed or called them. 2. He cannot be said to enter in Covenant with them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For all the world ever was thus Covenanted with God. 3. All the world must be an invisible Covenanted Church, and the fit matter to be a Church. For the Evangel may be Preached <hi>est de se annunciabile,</hi> not to stones and to rocks, but to all Nations, <hi>quovis seculo.</hi> 4. Since the Preaching of the Gospel to some Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and not to others, is an act of the Soveraign pleasure, yea and of the free grace of God to such as this Sun-light graciously doth visit, by this way, the sinfull neglect of such as refuse to Preach shall be the cause of the perishing of the elect, a dream.</p>

                  <hi>Socinus, Crellius,</hi> the <hi>Raccovian Catechism, Arminius,</hi> contend that Christ died for all <hi>finaliter,</hi> for to procure good and salvation to all, so they beleeve, and yet through their own fault, they may haply never be saved: not that he satisfied for us, but died for example as a Martyr (say <hi>Socinians</hi>) as <hi>Paul</hi> suffered for the Church, so as we, beleeving in Christ as in the only chief Martyr and witnesse, who as the only Author declared the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, not as a sufferer and ransom-payer who redeemed us from the Law, are saved. And as <hi>Arminians,</hi> he died for our good, not that he died in our room and stead, so as the sins of the Elect were actually taken off them and translated upon Christ, so as wee are actually freed from the punishment of sin, as if we had substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Saviour our selves, and payed our debt our selves to God; and so according to the rigour of Justice, we might crave by the Law of buying and selling deliverance from punishment, and life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall from God. But this way they will not have Christ to die in the place and room of any, but only for their good, so as they may die eternally themselves for whom <hi>Christ</hi> died. Hence 1. It follows that Christ died for them but gave no ransome of blood for them for whom he died. 2. <hi>Arminians</hi> will not have the sins and punishment satisfactory to justice (for of such punishment we speak) actually upon <hi>Christ,</hi> and translated off the sinner and laid

upon <hi>Christ</hi> and beleevers actually freed from satisfactory punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So that both beleevers and <hi>Christ</hi> must actually bear the satisfactory punishment.

And since <hi>Arminians</hi> denies that we payed to Justice a ransome for sin, because our Surety Christ payed for us, he must deny that <hi>Christ was wounded for our transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and bruised for our iniquities,</hi> or that <hi>the chastisement of our peace was upon him</hi>: Contrair to <hi>Isai.</hi> 53.5. because we made him not our Mediatour and Surety, but God made him Mediatour, and laid our iniquities upon him, <hi>Isai.</hi> 53.6. But it is accidentall in Law that the debter substitute the surety,<note place="margin">One may in Law, be a real and true satis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fying sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thogh the debter neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, nor Covenant with him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, yea though he know no, thing of the sureties willingness to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and so <hi>Christ</hi> is our surety.</note> or request him to take the place of surety upon him.

As a Kings son who comes in and layes down his head for a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, truely and really dyeth and layeth down his life in the room and place of that malefactor, though there was no Covenant nor paction between him and the Kings son, though neither the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, nor any friend in his name did request the Prince to become surety and die for him. <hi>Reuben</hi> offers his two sons to <hi>Jacob</hi> as pawnds to be slain, if he should not bring home <hi>Benjamin</hi> safe to the father: And had <hi>Jacob</hi> accepted of the offer, <hi>Reubens</hi> two sons who knew not of the bargain, had been sureties for <hi>Benjamin,</hi> Gen. 42.37. and <hi>Judah</hi> might have been Law-surety for <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> though <hi>Benjamin</hi> requested him not to take any such place. The Lord the Creditour and Christ the Cautioner did strike hands together: Christ put himself in our room, as an hostage, pledge and surety to die for us, and payed the first and second death, the summe that we was owing, according to a paction between the Lord and Christ, and we requested not <hi>Christ</hi> to be surety, only by beleeving, we thank him, and subscribe and say Amen to what is done.

               <p n="3">3. The Lord could not but have punished the Elect with hating &amp; aversion of mind, they being intrinsecally and inherently sinners.

               <p n="2">2. The debt and summe is one, not two debts, nor two ransoms, nor two punishments, nor two lives to losse, but one.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is one and the same solution and satisfaction, there can not in Law-justice, come another reckoning, dying, and payment ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after the surety hath payed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is one and the same acceptation upon the creditor his part, if he accept of satisfaction in the payment made by the sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he cannot but legally accept of the debter, and cannot pursue him in Law, but must look upon him as no debter.

The proposition is out of doubt, none denies the Minor, but that we should have died eternally in our persons, if Christ had not died for us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He who of purpose took on him our nature, the nature and seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the legall condition of a surety to suffer for us, he stood in our person and room in suffering for us. But Christ took on him our nature, which is common to beleeving Jews, and to such also who are casten off of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3, 4. but not as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them, but as the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Heb. 2.16.</p>

Then as Christs dying for sinners, is for the good, profite, saving, beleeving, and confirming of the faith, establishing the comfort of sinners, then by the like Christs dying for sins, must be to save sins from hell, to bring sins to God, that sins should not live to themselves, and to establish the faith, the consolation of sins; whereas Christ died not for sins as for sinners, that he might save sins, but to dissolve the works of the devill, to take away sin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. Christ dies one way for sins, and another way for sinners: The Physitian one way cures the disease that it may be rooted out, and be no more, and another way the diseased person, that he may live and be in health.</p>

Yet I desire to beleeve that <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. <hi>his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree.</hi> And that <hi>he was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities,</hi> who now live, <hi>Isai.</hi> 53.5. and they cannot deny this, who teach that CHRIST died for the sins of the world, none excepted. And the child in the womb, when the father is absolved from treason is really and in Law restored to his fathers inheritance: And the sucking child may be Crowned a King, and take possession of a Kingdom, and take the oath of loyalty of the subjects in the person of another, though <hi>physically</hi> he neither do, nor know what is done, but sleep in the armes of the nurse.

For we suffer not death such as Christ suffered, to wit, for sin, watered and affected with the curse of the Law; nor must we measure death from body or bulk of departing, but from the salt, and worst of death, which is the curse, and that being removed, we never die, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.26. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.24. no more look upon death in the Law, for there it raigns, but in <hi>Christ,</hi> and in him death is dead and removed; the formall demeriting power is removed, when the Law is satisfied: And a beleever being dead to the Law is dead to the curse and to the worst of death, as Christ is dead<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to it now.</p>
               <p>Obj. 3. <hi>But the conscience of the beleever, suppose there were no devill, challenges him of sin, and therefore that he is under a curse?</hi>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The conscience may be the factor and deputie of Sathan in that also,<note place="margin">We depose CHRIST (with reverence to his holiness) from his office of Mediator, when we embark, having once beleeved in him, in a new plea with the Law.</note> for it is the deposing of Christ from his Office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator


<pb n="259" facs="tcp:58986:140"/>
in satisfying and answering by his death all the demands of the Law, there is none but Christ, when the Law demands blood and the torments of the second death, can plead any thing on the contrair. Rom. 3.19. <hi>We know that what things soever the Law speaks, it speaks to these that are under the Law</hi>: but the Law speaks not then to a beleever, for he is under grace, and so is not in tearms of treating or parleying with the Law. Christ was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and the beleever is <hi>legally</hi> crucified with Christ, buried and risen again with Christ. 1. Then the Law is not his judge, it spake to Christ and condemned him and put him to death, when he was under the Law, and condemned you in him, now you say, Christ is not condemned and crucified, when ye enter in a new treatie with the Law to receive a new sentence from it, and thus ye undoe what Christ hath perfectly done. 2. To hearken to conscience compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and making another paction with the Law then Christ hath made, is to take the plea that Christ hath embarked in, off his hand; ye are to stand still and be silent, and beleeve that Christs dying, and your dying in him, is a closing of a satisfactory bargain with the Law. <hi>Christ condemned sin in the flesh,</hi> by taking on his flesh the curse due to us for sin, &amp; <hi>for sin,</hi> that is, for sins cause, that it might be taken away, <hi>he sent his Son to die,</hi> Rom. 8.3. and judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn sin. 3. This is to mistate a question well debated and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed by Christ; for he being <hi>the end and perfection of the Law,</hi> hath silenced, and satisfied the Law,<note place="margin">We are not to act of new a plea with the Law, being now in another kingdome and freed from the Law.</note> and to what use can it serve to make a new plea and a bastard controversie with a satisfied party, or to hearken to conscience which craves in the name of mistaken Law well payed debts, and this is but Sathan abusing the Law, and feigning Letters of Caption in the name of the Law, to trouble the quieted conscience of a beleever. But its safest to say, I stand to what Christ hath done and suffered to fulfill the Law, and I believe I was crucified in him, judged, and condemned legally in Christ: and what can you seek more of an ill-doer? He is condemned, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, hanged on a tree, and so is justice quieted. Some raise the devill and a storm in the soul and cannot calm it again: It is not good to provoke, irritate, and waken a sleeping dogge. There is quietnesse and peace of beleeving what Christ hath done as well done, and comfortably to rest on his deed by faith. Hence a case


<pb n="260" facs="tcp:58986:141"/>
of some, who, because they are under deadnesse and security, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire a wakening of conscience,<note place="margin">We are not to desire a Law-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gospel-deadnesse.</note> and Sathan hath taught some to commit some hainous guiltinesse, that they may fall in the hand of justice, and so be wakened, and Sathan gives them their fill of it. Hence, we had rather take a Law-way which is not Gods way, as ly under deadnesse; there may be a legall looking upon deadnesse, whereas it is a Gospel-sin that we should be humbled for, and in which we should not please our selves; but no man freed from the Law and brought out of prison, should be willing or desirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the dungeon again. We should let <hi>God</hi> guide us under a feaver, and not be our own Physitians, but be quiet at Christs part, if he be pleased to cure by contrairs, and to quicken me by deadening me, or to make a soul humble by smiting with a spirit of pride: its good, we are to submit.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>How could we be in Christ as in our surety</hi> (for saith <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius) we did not give nor appoint Christ to be our Cautioner or Surety?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Its evill arguing of <hi>Arminius</hi> or <hi>Sathan,</hi> who would make the union either naturall or legall betwixt us and Christ, weak,<note place="margin">VVe sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>,</hi> though we had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being nor hand in making <hi>Adam</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our naturall or Law-head, so may we be legally crucified with <hi>Christ</hi> our surety, though we had no hand in appointing <hi>Christ</hi> to be our surety.</note> far off, generall, and such as is betwixt Christ and Pagans and all the world: But this reason is nought, for we sinners were not born and very nothing, when God made the first <hi>Adam</hi> our father and head in Law as in nature, nor had we any hand or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in substituting the first <hi>Adam</hi> in his place, and yet we sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> and his sin is ours, by divine imputation. But can any deny but Christ on the Crosse did act the cause of many belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers not born? This is peculiar to this dispensation, that the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, not the debter, appoint both the Law-head, and the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick Surety. The Surety had from us a Cautionary, sponsorie, and deputed nature, but no subscribed commission from us, it was in the heart of the Creditor by grace efficacious to obtain our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and to make a sort of legall marriage assuming our nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we either knew our husband, or gave consent to the marriage-Covenant. As the Advocat speaks in the person of the Client ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and sleeping, and when the Client hears and sees how his cause is promoved, he both assents unto, and renders thanks and praises to the Advocat: and so the absent and far off Client not knowing


<pb n="261" facs="tcp:58986:141"/>
any thing does act in the Advocat. And how many answers doth our Advocat in Heaven make for sinners on earth in his pleadings, of which we know not in particular any thing? Nor doth Christ speak or plead for beleevers as a privat man, nor appear in his Name as it were, but in our person.</p>
               <p>Neither is there a faining of a person here, or a borrowed and fained redemption, there be these five here.<note place="margin">All the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisits to a reall satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction are in Christs dying for us.</note> 1. A Redeemer <hi>Christ.</hi> 2. Persons redeemed, <hi>sinners.</hi> 3. A Lord from whom we are redeemed, the <hi>Lord Jehovah,</hi> not simply, as God, he is the partie from whom we are redeemed, but God as the offended Law-giver, who had us lyable to eternall punishment. 4. There was a <hi>price,</hi> the life and blood of <hi>God,</hi> which though not profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to <hi>God</hi> (for that is extrinsecall to satisfaction reall) yet an aboundant compensation to justice for declarative glory taken from <hi>God</hi> which is the nature of reall satisfaction. 5. There is here a God just, true, holy, unchangeable, to whom the price is payed. Nor does <hi>Christ</hi> sustain the person of the enemy Satan from whom we are redeemed, for he is but the <hi>lictor</hi> who then had no right to detain us, we are redeemed from evils of sin and punishment: Nor doth Christ in suffering sustain the person of God. Hence, from our being crucified with Christ crucified, something is to be said in a practicall way of our mortification; for mortification flows originally from Christs death, we being crucified in him and with him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is mortification?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a deadning of the whole powers and inclinations of the soul in their bentnesse and operations,<note place="margin">What mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is.</note> in order to things forbidden by the Law of God, or in things indifferent and commanded. Hence, not the affections only, but the understanding and mind must be deadned. And therefore this is no mortification untill sin origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall be subdued in its damnation by Christs death, and in its domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by the Spirit of Sanctification. A tree is not withered while standing on its root, bulk and branches are green and flourishing: Its much to know the withdrawing of sap and life from the root and the vitall parts of old <hi>Adam.</hi> The ebbing of a River is not the dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of it; the new birth only is mortification.</p>
               <p>Q. 2. <hi>Since mortification comes only from Christs death, what is the influence of Christs death herein?</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The influence is reall, <hi>ad modum causae physicae,</hi> the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of blood hath <hi>bought us from our vain conversation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18. <hi>Christ</hi> dying doth merit by blood the Spirit, and infused grace, which deadens the whole life of sin. Evangelick Arguments from ten heavens, from ten Gospels working morally and in a swasory way, cannot more work mortification then touching can make a reall change on a dead corps; we was legally dead and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Christ, and with Christ, when he died, many not being born then: But in the infusing of the life of God, Christ applyes the reall principle of mortification. Now the redemption <hi>from a vain conversation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18. <hi>from the present evil world,</hi> Gal. 1.4. is as reall and proper a bargain, except we follow <hi>Socinus, as redemption from the wrath to come.</hi> 2. <hi>Christs</hi> death hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence morall and swasorie to work mortification: As 1 Pet. 1.16. <hi>Be holy.</hi> 17. <hi>Passe the time of your sojourning in fear. For ye are bought</hi> with his blood <hi>from your vain conversation.</hi> And 1 Pet. 5.1, 2. <hi>Christ hath suffered in the flesh, therefore be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to your lusts,</hi> and serve them not, as the Gentiles do: So <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1.5. But the action morall of the Gospel doth not work upon the naturall man:<note place="margin">Gospel ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments how and upon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> they work.</note> for like works upon the like; carnall reason upon a carnall spirit; and spirituall Arguments upon a renewed man; as an Argument from a painted feather works upon a child, more then an Argument from an inheritance, which no doubt will work upon a man come to age, and yet neither the one nor the other works upon a renewed mind to remove him off <hi>Christ</hi> his rock. Hence it is, 3. that Acts of Omnipotency are used as Morall Arguments: also, <hi>God works in you to will and to do, therefore work out your salvation.</hi> And choosing, redeeming, calling, justifying, quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening, converting, are brought in as causes in Scripture, both reall and morall; but they work morally on reason, where there is an impression of faith and principle of life. The Gospel works on an unrenewed man to perswade him almost to be a Christian: Ye may perswade a youth to a course,<note place="margin">When rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> is green, adherence<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to a course by perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stable.</note> and get his word, consent, and write; but because reason is green and young, he falls off it again, but a man of judgement shall stand to it: yet if he be not renewed, reason is also green and raw before a spirituall tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a mad man, none will do that. 2. If any thing, without a child of <hi>God,</hi> work upon him, they move him not much: Psal. 131.2. <hi>Surely I have behaved and quieted my self, as a child that is weaned of his mother, my soul is even as a weaned child.</hi> Acts 20.24. <hi>None of these things move me</hi>: I make not much rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of bands. <hi>Peter,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Its hard to give the division of them logically: There is 1. a naturall mortification, there is no fire in the affections of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king infants to Crowns, Kingdomes, to treasures of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

               <p n="2">2. There is a compelled mortification, sicknesse and withered arms and legs, and strong fetters in the prison, poverty and want, care for bread, and the armed man poverty that hath a sharp sword, <hi>necessity</hi> blunts the affections in their second acts, the man hath no mind of whooring:<note place="margin">2.

Job 31.24. <hi>If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, thou art my confidence; Or,</hi> 25. <hi>have rejoiced because my wealth was great.</hi> Its true, a beggar and an extream poor man that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have bread, is not troubled nor much tempted to seek a Kingdom and the millions and tunnes of gold that many rich ones have; but yet there are speculative desires and rolling waves and floods of wishes in the heart for these: and because hunger and want of bread is his door enemy lying between him and the hope of great riches, the man is neither mortified to the love of bread nor to the millions of gold that the heart is sick after. And as there be diverse kinds and speces of pests, and they are not all of one kind, yet all contrair to the blood and the heat of life: So are there sundry kinds of unmortified lusts about riches according to the sicknesse of the desire.</p>

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:58986:146"/>
that which is more nor sufficient, which would destroy and not feed but over-feed, is the faulty desire; as sicknesse desires drink more then sufficient, not for health, but to feed the disease, it is the desire of the disease rather then of the man diseased; and the forbidden desire is the sin.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If the desire of more then enough come from the habit of covetousnesse, the man is not mortified to <hi>Mammon</hi>: all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full habits in the child of God are broken, and lessened,<note place="margin">Whether acts of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse may consist with mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and how.</note> and chased in to inclinations, or to the habit of Originall corruption slackened and by grace subdued; but in every child of God there is sin dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and the flesh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17, 18. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8, 10. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. and the old man, which is put off by degrees, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5.10. which is a habit of corruption not in full vigor, but sickening, decaying, and a dying daily, but even a grown child of God from this broken and sick habit may, temptation inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and the Lord withdrawing his influence of grace, may break out into grosse acts of covetousnesse, adultery, murther, as is clear in <hi>David, Lot, Peter, Asa,</hi> and that saith that mortification is compleat in none. And there is too oft a sort of sinfull resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the habit of sin and the flesh, so that <hi>David</hi> seems not to be <hi>David,</hi> but an adulterer, a murtherer: As we see it is the same River that swells over its banks, that it was before, but the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing is from without, from the clouds and from excessive rain, the river also hath a receptive capacity in it self to exceed its banks and channel: So hath a child of God from strong temptation from without, and broken corruption from within, a more then his own ordinary quantity and swelling over his channel; To teach us that our mortification is a work not of day, but of our whole life.

And often men judge themselves mortified, because they are dead, it may be to riches, but alive to ambition and desire of honour. As <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> spared no charges for his gods, his pleasure, but he was alive to honour, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.30. <hi>Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the Kingdom, by the might of my

Some sins cleave to us as our hair and nails, as a custome of some sinfull words, these are sooner mortified; and yet if mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification be not in the heart, these take life again, as hairs and nails cutted and shaven grow again.

Christs dying to bear witnesse to his own Gospel is only the secondary end of his death, in so far as secondarily remission of sins is made known to us after the principall end of his death, to wit, reconciliation, remission, pardon, redemption, and life is purchased to us by way of merit: And sure the truth of pardon and redemption is hugely more confirmed and sealed by the whole company of the Martyrs, and made known to the sons of men, then by the death of one single man, <hi>Maries Son:</hi> Nor does the Scripture ever commend Christs love to us in sealing the Gospel with his blood as the only way to life, or making this the most strong Argument to move us

                  </note> This would seem no satisfying of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. <hi>Ans.</hi> It is true the case would seem no quieting of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. If 1. <hi>Christ-God</hi> were not the same offended God, who out of soveraignty of free grace doth condescend to make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, and so is upon Gods side. 2. If Christ were not a Person different from offended <hi>God,</hi> as the Godhead is common to all the three, so in a voluntary and admirable dispensation and Oeconomie the Kings Son, a Person different from the Father, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth upon him our nature; And 3. having mans nature which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and so being fit therein to satisfie wrath, and fit therein to merit, to <hi>sanctifie the people with his own blood,</hi> might well be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our side: and there's no scenick, no seeming, but a most reall satisfaction here, in that there is a most full and reall compensation made to offended justice, and our faith laying hold on this, the conscience is quieted.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Justice saith so, but that part of justice by the graciousnesse and mercifulnesse of the Just<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>God is, and may be dispensed withall: So as Justice as Justice seeks payment,<note place="margin">Justice as justice seeks satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, but Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of free-grace, not justice, determines how, and who shall pay.</note> the Creditor as the Creditor seeks recompence and restitution: But by whom, Justice deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines not, whether payment and satisfaction be made by the same very person who offended, or by a fit surety in the person and place of the offender, as it determines not whether as much or far more be restored then was taken away, so there be a compact and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary agreement between the satisfier and the satisfied. Hence, Justice being 1. offended, is not (to speak so) the interposing and the mediating attribute of God; but Soveraignty of Free-grace and mercy interposeth.<note place="margin">Justice is not the me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diating and interposing attribute, but free-grace.</note> 2. Justice may seek payment from the only offending partie, and from no other, from <hi>Adam</hi> and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity only; but Justice doth not indispensably, and by necessity of nature exact payment from the only offender and from no other. 3. The conscience of the beleever may with sweetnesse of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and peace rest upon satisfied justice, and adore interposing grace, and be quickened from looking unto, and loving interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing grace, to obey and take on the labour of Gospel-love to run the wayes of his Commandements. 4. It is not an act of Law, nor of Justice, to give, or find out a satisfier, but an act of love, grace, and infinite wisedom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 3. A third case is, how can the beleever look upon life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall as a gift, if it be sold at so condign a price as Christs blood?</p>

                  <note place="margin">Our glory was work and wadge to Christ, but of free grace to us, we bought it not.</note>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is not fit to speak of this mysterie, but with holy reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, life eternall is bought to us, and we are said to be bought with a price, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28. Now it is unworthy of Christ, that the fruit of his death should be only grace, not glory, and such a grace as is lubrick, uncertain, renders us indifferent, but much weaker to beleeve or not believe, that is, as <hi>Socinians</hi> say, to earne and win the wager of Glory by a new Gospel-working, which is our righteousnesse, and merit to glory: For sure Pagans are more sinfully weak in the Second ADAM who died for them, as <hi>Socinus</hi> will, then mankind were in the first <hi>Adam.</hi> The Scripture saith that Christ gave himself for his Church, that he might present her <hi>a glorious Church,</hi> Eph. 5.

               <p>Ans. <hi>Socinians, Arminians,</hi> yea <hi>Pagans,</hi> and all enemies to Christian Religion, are burdened with the same seeming reason: For if God, or their gods may hinder wickednesse, and yet do not hinder it, they bring themselves, or the true God, that they must be necessitated to torment the sinners.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There be reasons unanswerable, why if we yeeld (and it is a shame to deny) that God is able to hinder sin to enter in the world, or that he is not infinitly wise,<note place="margin">Deep rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the depth of unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, why the Lord who can hinder sin to enter in the world, thought fit it should be</note> and so that he hath not most weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reasons why he suffers sin to be: As 1. if sin come freely in the world without the will of God, either the Lords dominion over sin must be none at all; or the creatures dominion of free-will must be dependent upon the dominion of grace and Soveraignty. 2. The out-goings of free-grace must eternally be hid, if sin had never been. As there had been no field for the expressions and blossoms of eternall flourishing revenging justice: As also, the creatures armes are short, and could not reach the eminent degree of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing the glory of free-grace and pardoning mercy, but the Lord aimed at this. And 1. the relation of a Saviour and a sinner, of the Physician and the sick must be known; Now a Physician hath not relation actuall to all sick, all the world over, but only to his own patients, his own sick ones, who by Covenant, feeling their

And <hi>Christ</hi> may hold forth something of this, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.7. <hi>Likewise I say unto you</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>there is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more then over nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and nine just persons that need no repentance.</hi> True it is our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours scope is not to compare repentance and Law-innocency toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or to show that the <hi>Pharisees</hi> needed no repentance, as if they were not in a lost condition: but to show what joy was in heaven with the Lord the father of the forlorn son, and in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, at the home coming of repenting sinners. And is not a Jewell of ten thousand millions of more worth then a Diamond that is not worth the eighth part of that summe? <hi>Adams</hi> innocency and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sinning should have been by the common influences of Law-love, and the same may be said of Angel-innocency. But Gospel-repentance is the gift procured at a dearer rate, Christ was exalted a Prince to give repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. Neither should there be sense and such loving sense of free grace in the forlorn son, had he never fled away from his father, and never been so received with a welcome of grace which he beleeved, before he felt it.</p>

               <p>The fifth Argument is from Christs receiving the Seals, Who so receives in his body the Seals of the Covenant of Grace, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, and Baptism, and yet needs no putting off of the <hi>body of the sins of the flesh,</hi> by Circumcision, and needs <hi>no forgivenesse of sin,</hi>

no regeneration, no burying with Christ in Baptism, as <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5. and eats the Passeover, and needs not that the Lamb of God take away his sins, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. since he is holy, and without sin, he must be under the Covenant, and God must be his God, in some other Covenant then sinners are, for these seals are proper to a Covenanted people, strangers and Pagans might not receive them, but these in Covenant only, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. and <hi>Christ</hi> must have received Seals for other uses and ends, then sinners received them, to wit, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie that he was the God of both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and that he was the undertaker for us, in a Covenant of suretyship for us, to perfect a higher command then any mortall man was under, to wit, to lay down his life for sinners, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. and beside that, for our cause he was <hi>made under the Law, to fulfill all righteousness,</hi> and so was Circumcised, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.21. Baptized, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.13, 16, 17. did eat the Passeover with the Disciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.18<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 19, 20. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.18. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.13, 14. he<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> in coming under that state in which he must, because a man, fulfill the Law, and be under even Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel commands so far as they were suteable to his holy Nature, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth in obeying all commands even of the Morall Law (and as the Son of <hi>God</hi> he was under no such obligation) that he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a speciall ingagement, and compact to God, for the work of Redemption. And we are taught to feel what imbred delight and sweetnesse of peace is in duties; when Christ Covenants with God to come under the Law, and under the hardest of commands, to lay down his life for sinners, because it was a Law and command by Covenant, that hath most of obedience which hath most of a Law.</p>
               <p>

               <p>THe Covenant of Redemption is two wayes considered. 1. As transacted in time between <hi>Jehovah</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> in his actuall discharge of his office of King, Priest and Prophet. 2. As it is an eternall transaction and compact between <hi>Jehovah</hi> and the second Person the <hi>Son of God,</hi> who gave personall consent that he should be the Undertaker, and no other. And these three acts are consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in the Persons in this latter consideration:

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>As to the first: There must have been a Person, either the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,


<pb n="303" facs="tcp:58986:163"/>
or the Son, or the Spirit. 1. By God, from eternity set apart, separated, and designed: And 2. This person must have given an actuall consent from eternity to the designation: Now the person designed was the Son only, this lot eternally (to speak so) fell upon only him who was, <gap reason="foreign">

And because <hi>Christ-God</hi> equall with the Father, does not begin to consent and agree to the designation in time, nor can <hi>Christ-God</hi> will any thing in time, which he did not will, and consent unto, from eternity; therefore he was present with the Father, and consented unto the designation, and closed the bargain from eternity: upon which account, Christ had the glory of a designed Saviour with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, before the world was, and prayes that he may, <hi>God-Man,</hi> be glorified, as touching the manifestation of that glory to Angels and men, with the glory <hi>that he had with the Father before the world was,</hi>

Hence, 2. offended Justice by the breach of the Covenant of Works in all the three Persons pleads that man should die, and that pleading is most just, and the Law cannot be broken nor repealed. <hi>The soul that sins must die,</hi> Ezech. 18. the threatning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. must be fulfilled. 2.

So also, <hi>Cajetan: Semini autem ejus, tanquam &amp; cui promissa sunt, &amp; in quo adimplenda erant promissa. Corn. Ã  lapide:</hi> If the word seed, <hi>semen,</hi> were taken <hi>collectively,</hi> the promise could not stand; for its sure all the Jews were not blessed in the seed: Yea many of them (saith <hi>Calvin) were a curse. Estius</hi> saith, the word <hi>seed,</hi> is a collective name, and notteth many; and hath not in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew the Plurall Number. <hi>Augustine</hi> (saith he) will have all Christians following the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> to be here noted, for they are that seed to which the promise is made, whereas <hi>Christ</hi> is properly he in whom the promise is to be fulfilled, and in whom all are one by faith,<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. is not made to Christ my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall.</note> and all are reduced to the Singular Number.</p>
               <p>There is no reason to expound the <hi>Seed Christ,</hi> of <hi>Mysticall Christ</hi> and of his Seed. 1. Because the <hi>Seed</hi> is he <hi>in whom the Nations are blessed,</hi> both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> v. 14. And the


<pb n="313" facs="tcp:58986:168"/>
Seed <hi>made a curse for us,</hi> v. 13. But this seed is only <hi>Christ,</hi> not <hi>mysticall Christ,</hi> head and members: for neither are we blessed in <hi>Christ</hi> mysticall, nor was <hi>Christ</hi> mysticall the Church made a curse for us: Nor did the Church mysticall pay a price of satisfaction to offended justice for us, <hi>v.</hi> 19. The word <hi>seed</hi> seems to have the same signification, <hi>v.</hi> 16. and <hi>v.</hi> 19. Consider then, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then serveth the Law? It was added because of transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, untill the seed come, to whom the promise was made.</hi> Now the <hi>seed coming</hi> is <hi>Christ</hi> coming in the flesh to take on our nature. If the seed were taken for Christ mysticall, the Apostle must say, <hi>The Law was added because of transgression, untill the seed should come:</hi> that is, untill <hi>Christ</hi> mysticall, his Church should come in the flesh, which is non-sense. 3. Whether the promise be of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and of life eternall thereby holden forth; Or of <hi>Christ</hi> to come of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in whom all flesh shall be blessed; or of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse by faith, not by the works of the Law; Or of all these coming under the name of the <hi>inheritance,</hi> the promise is made to many in number like the Stars: For the Lamb and the hundreth fourty and four thousands standing with him on Mount Zion, and the thousands of thousands which none can number, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9. are many, and may well be called <hi>seeds</hi>; And though they be all one in Christ, yet the Apostle must speak too ambiguously, when he said, The promise of righteousnesse and life is made to the <hi>seed,</hi> that is, to Christ head and members: for the promise is so made to Christ, especially of life, pardon, righteousnesse, as the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings promised are fulfilled &amp; given through, &amp; for Christ as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meritorious cause, as all grant: which way the promises are in no sense made to believers, who cannot come in as joint satisfiers with <hi>Christ,</hi> &amp; as joint meritorious procurers with Christ of the blessings promised to us. 4. The promise is made to the <hi>seed</hi> coming in the flesh, and assuming our nature in a personal union, <hi>v.</hi> 19. as is, by confession of all, expounded. Now this restricts the promise to <hi>God incarnate,</hi> and must exclude the members. 5. It runs most connaturally to the Text, and comfortably to us, if neither Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. be understood as a private man, the <hi>Sonne of Mary:</hi> nor yet as <hi>Christ mysticall,</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. But as Christ, a publike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Lord-Mediator.</hi> 1. He represents all the

                  </note> and so the word <hi>seed</hi> is taken individually.

And so as <hi>Christ</hi> having the Gospel and Covenant-promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses committed to him, so should it be with us: and this Tutor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not miscarry, and so shall it be well with the Pupils and Minors.</p>
               <p>Were it no more but that, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Because I live, ye shall live also:</hi> ye shall live by promise, the free promise of life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: its no small vantage.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The promises are laid down in <hi>Christ</hi> as in a publike <hi>Lord-Keeper. Christ</hi> is that excellent Ark in which are the Tables of the Covenant, and the Book of the Law and Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.26. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.9. and as the first subject of the promises he keepeth them. Yea and Christ is the fountain and originall cause of all the promises: for he merited by his blood, remission, righteousnesse, perseverance, eternall life, all grace, which the Lord makes ours by free promise. 2. In Christ they are made and published to us: so they are dear mercies to Christ: they stand Christ at a dear rate: they are ours freely for no price or hire. 3. Hence nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but the promises as made to Christ the first Heir and Son of promise: for Christ is the chief and principall thing promised, and other things that are freely given us (by promise) are given to us, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, with Christ, or after that he hath given us Christ: and assignies, and younger brethren come in under the first Heir. Our blood-relation to the Family stands by Christ, interest to promises comes all this way. The Lords method is, Get first Christ, then all the promises are yours: for they follow him. And Christ well manages Covenant-promises, as they most tend to the good of his own.</p>
               <p>And this is specially to be considered that Christ, from the womb to the grace, does act and suffer nothing but as a publike person. For us he was born, <hi>Isai.</hi> 9.6. <hi>For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given,</hi> Luke 2.11. Rejoice (saith the <hi>Angel) for

               <p>AN Argument 13. is taken from the necessity of this Covenant of Redemption. 1. From the call of <hi>God</hi>: Christ took not on him to be a Priest, <hi>nor did he glorify himself to be made an High Priest, but that he said unto him,</hi> Heb. 5. <hi>Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee</hi>: That is, I have ordained thee to have the honourable calling of the High Priest. The Apostle also, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. applyeth this in part to the eternall generation of the Son: And <hi>Act.</hi> 13.33. the Apostle applyes this to <hi>Christs</hi> rising from the dead, because in these two latter, manifestly appears the God Head of the Son, in that he is true High Priest, who, by offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self hath taken away our sins,<note place="margin">He who took not on him to be Priest and King, but upon the call of God must be made Priest and King by Covenant.</note> which only <hi>God</hi> can do. In the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He is declared to be the Son of God with power, â€” by the resurrection from the dead.</hi> He who took not upon him to be High Priest while <hi>God</hi> called him, and neither took upon him to be King, while <hi>God</hi> called him, and said, Psal. 2.6. <hi>I have Anointed him my King, upon my holy Hill of Zion,</hi> and willingly consented to the call of <hi>God,</hi> to be King and Priest. He must be made Priest and King by Covenant between him and <hi>God</hi>: for Priests and Kings were called by Covenant, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 5. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11.17. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is necessarie that the promises that are our Writs and Charters<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> of Heaven be in a surer hand then in our own, to wit, in the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of <hi>Christ:</hi> For this is an absolute promise made to us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh.</hi> This promise is not formally made to <hi>Christ,</hi> yet it is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Covenant-promise, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. for there is no stony heart in <hi>Christ,</hi> yet the promise is laid down in him, and made

Some say, as <hi>Calvin, Luther, Muscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> by the Preached Gospel: But it is clear, he alludeth to the Law of sprinkling, Exod. 24.8. <hi>And</hi> Moses <hi>took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which the Lord hath made with you, concerning all these words.</hi> Now of that blood it is said, Exod. 24.6. <hi>And</hi> Moses <hi>took half of the blood</hi> (of the oxen that the young men of the children of Israel offered, <hi>v.</hi> 5.) <hi>and put it in basons,</hi>

For in Christs coming under that act, when he was made Surety, there be two things: 1. His eternall condiscending to take on him our nature, and to empty himself and be a servant. 2. His agreeing and plighting of his faith and truth to take on our condition in Law, that <hi>God</hi> should lay upon him the iniquity of us all, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.6. and that <hi>God</hi> should make him <hi>who knew no sin, to be sin for us,</hi>

               <p>But it may be said, if Christs dying for sinners remove as a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory punishment, the guilt and obligation to eternall wrath, what way is the reall, and as it were, the physicall inherency and essence of sin removed? <hi>Ans.</hi> The obligation to wrath is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved only in a legal way by suffering of punishment due to sin,<note place="margin">Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a Surety can remove pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment from the guiltyman, but cannot remove formally the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent guilt<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and make him formally and physically and inherently innocent, except the punishment of the Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty so excellent procure, by way of merite, the expelling of sin, and the incoming of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent holinesse in its room, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>10.</note> which <hi>Christ</hi> hath done; But the essence reall of sin is only removed, as every other contrair is removed, by the expelling of sin out of its subject, and by introducing the contrair form, to wit, inherent righteousnesse, and the perfect habit of Sanctification and holiness. Now for this, <hi>Christs</hi> dying and suffering wrath due to us, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Christ</hi> should die a thousand thousand times for us, his dying cannot as a satisfying cause, or as a punishment remove this. For 1. a punishment suffered by our Surety can but exhaust and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the punishment due to the sinner for whom the suretyship is undertaken. But 2. <hi>Christs</hi> dying cannot as a punishment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move


<pb n="324" facs="tcp:58986:174"/>
sin as sin, and as contrair to the holy Law, and make us defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led wretches and servants of sin holy, as the paying of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns for a forlorn waster, cannot make him to be no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and a man that hath obeyed the Law; only it makes that in Law the payment cannot be charged upon him. 3. Christs tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacting with God as our Surety is not only then meerly to remove eternall punishment, but to purchase by the merit of his death the healing and sanctifying of our nature, Heb. 10.10. <hi>By the which will we are sanctified by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What will of GOD, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. sanctifieth us.</note> Then our Sanctification is procured to us by the will of <hi>God,</hi> not simply as his commanding will: for then should all and every one whom the Lord commands to be holy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. be sanctified, which we see is not done: but by the will of the Father, commanding <hi>Christ</hi> to die, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.31. and the will of Christ offering himself once for a sacrifice for sin, is the will which sanctifies us. So <hi>Pareus</hi> well saith, it is the will with its correlate, for in the willing passive obedience of <hi>Christ</hi> are we sanctified real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the merit of his death, though this be wrought by degrees. 2. Since the Father consents and wills that <hi>Christ</hi> die, and the Son willingly offers himself a sacrifie, the number (as judicious and Godly M. <hi>Dickson</hi> hath well observed on the place) <hi>and these</hi> all,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>David Dickson,</hi> Exposit. of the Epistle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> cap. 10. v. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>for whom Christ offered himself, were condescended upon betwixt the Father and the Mediatour. God knew those whom he gave to the Son, to be ransoned: and Christ knew those whom he bought.</hi> And the necessity of this Covenant appears in this, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort cannot be solide, if a child of God never have any assurance of his being gifted of the Father to the Son in particular. For two things are clear here. 1. That the Lord knows who are his, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. and that, if <hi>God</hi> gave some to the Son, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. then the Son received them in a certain number. And if Christ bought them by Covenant,<note place="margin">Solid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in knowing these num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of these gifted to the Son, &amp; I am one of them.</note> he must know how many: As one who buyes a flock, but he knows the quality and number of the flock. 2. The knowledge sometime shall be this distinct, that I was by name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, <hi>who loved me, and gave himself for me.</hi> And as the offering of every Priest is by way of Covenant and promise, so, if a sacrifice, in the faith of the great sacrifice, be offered to <hi>God,</hi> then will <hi>God</hi> accept it (here is a Covenant) so is the Body of <hi>Christ</hi>


                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:58986:174"/>
offered by the Covenanting-will, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. And any doubt that may, or doth arise concerning your self by name: 1. It may as well be moved, in some respect, against the whole number, and no wise man will say that the bargain betwixt the Father and the Son was so blind, as the number was not agreed upon. For since all the bought are sinners, and so inclined to sinfull doubting of the bargain, that, which as a doubt is moved by one, may be moved by all severally, and all severally denying themselves to be the men for whom <hi>Christ</hi> bargained: By this sinfull questioning of the transaction, none at all were agreed upon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Every doubting of Gods love to me once justified, and who have once fled to <hi>Christ</hi> for refuge, is grounded upon sin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse; now none were given by the Father to the Son from eternity upon respect of either faith, or unbeleef, or holinesse, or bad deserving: Its true, it is not known to me but by beleeving,<note place="margin">Sin is no cause why a justified one should doubt of his justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</note> that I was given Covenant wayes to the Son. But the Question is, if sin be any ground why one justified should cashier himself out of the number of the gifted ones to Christ, and committed to the Mediatour. Its true, it should be mourned for as a thing that doth not a litle hinder Sanctification in its progresse, but should not brangle Justification, nor the faith of our interest in Christ. 4. The necessity of this Covenant appears, in that salvation is taken off free-will, and the slippery <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>no,</hi> of free-will in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, and laid upon one that is mighty, upon <hi>David,</hi> to govern Israel as their King;<note place="margin">M. <hi>D.

Should the heart of God be taken, and (to speak so) be sick of love for so many <hi>Nothings,</hi> whom he was to make heirs?

               <p>Here in this Covenant were first drawen the lineaments and draughts of the free and gracious interest of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to the sons of men: And who should not wonder here at the purest fountain-grace that is in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> which did set on work eternall wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to frame such an eternall peace of <hi>God</hi> Covenanting with the

For when Christ hath wrought the same work, payed the same very ransone (as these <hi>Sophists</hi> teach) for millions that perish, through their own free-will, eternally: What seed hath he of them? Where is his wage? Were not all and every one of mankind promised in the <hi>Arminian</hi> Covenant, to be the gifted seed of Christ, upon condition that they should repent and beleeve? But <hi>Arminians</hi> deny that God doth promise faith, or that he is so Lord and Master of the free-will of any, as indeclineably and unsuperably he can make good his promise, and cause them beleeve and persevere therein to the end, and that is it by which they are his seed. Its but said in vain that <hi>God</hi> promises they shall be Christs gifted seed, providing they be willing to beleeve: that is but to say, the Lord promises all shall be his seed, providing they shall be his seed: For willing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving makes them his seed. 2. By this also the Lord promises what is in mens power to perform, and it might fall out that all and every one should do the like that multitudes do, who perish eternally, and so shall Christ do his work, and injoy no seed at all.</p>
               <p>But the Covenant of suretyship which we teach, makes not the truth of God to depend upon our faith, or our unbeleef; Yea the Lord promises that Christ without all fail, shall undeclineably see his seed, yea, and shall be <hi>the restorer of the Tribes of Jacob, and a light to the Gentiles, and the salvation of God to the ends of the earth,</hi> Isa. 49.6.

and closed compact between the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> that we shall obey him: And indeed it is a meditation that morally and spiritually should obtain from us that we be holy as he is holy, and strongly melt the rocky heart. When we remembred that JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH, as a designed Surety, gave band for the heart of a sinner from eternity, and enters himself Cautioner for our rebellious will, it should put us to beleeve so much, and morally lay bands on our will.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How are we to conceive of the act of Suretyship?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Jehovah</hi> from eternity decrees that the Son be the designed person who shall take on our nature,<note place="margin">The eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of <hi>Jehovah</hi> &amp; of Christ for us.</note> and lay down his life for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: The Lord promises he shall have a redeemed seed for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>In this offer <hi>Jehovah</hi> ingadges that we shall be Christs seed, and so shall be, by the immortall seed, born again, and shall beleeve and be gifted to Christ as saved; here <hi>Jehovah</hi> undertakes that we shall beleeve.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Christ</hi> agrees to the designed person: <hi>It is written of me,</hi> and so decreed of <hi>God</hi> from eternity, <hi>I delight to do thy will,</hi> I shall lay down my life for these given to me: And here the other party, <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> coming by his own consent to die, does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so undertake, 1. In dying to ransone us from hell, and merit life to us, and make us his purchase. So 2. he being a Saviour by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he by his death purchaseth the Spirit, and meriteth the new heart, and so undertakes for us: in this regard, both parties un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for us. And the Spirit being the same very <hi>God</hi> with the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> also is by his own consent designed comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and actor in his way by the anointing without measure, that he puts on the Man Christ, and the grace given to his members: But the only formall parties in the compact are the <hi>Lord Jehovah</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> party consenting before time, and his Manhood in time becoming one who imbraces the Covenant of Suretyship, and calls the Lord his God, <hi>Ps.</hi> 22.1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.5.</p>
               <p>Hence, if we imploy faith, and hold out to the Lord the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking for us in the Covenant, there is an answer framed to all our temptations from our own frailty:<note place="margin">This Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers our tentations.</note> As <hi>Adam</hi> and the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> fell, and how can we stand?

Hence, it may well be said, that same <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. must prove both the Covenant of Surety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and the Covenant of Grace: v. 3. <hi>I have made a Covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant; thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy Throne to all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Though it be called <hi>Davids</hi> Throne here, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.32. yet we may freely speak of <hi>Davids</hi> Throne as of <hi>Davids</hi> body, both saw corruption: there is an end of <hi>Davids</hi> Throne temporall.

So he takes his mercy, Covenant-mercy (but offered conditionally) utterly away from reprobats when they sin, but takes not away Covenant-mercy from the seed of Christ: And the reason is, from the nature of the Covenant, v. 34. <hi>My Covenant I will not break<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
