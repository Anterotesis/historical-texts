            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He first application I make, is
for <hi>pardon,</hi> that I have adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to prefix your <hi>name</hi> to the
<hi>Frontispice</hi> of this Work, which
in it self, cannot be thought
worthy of your <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Protection;</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no proportion between the greatness of
your <hi>Merit,</hi> and so mean an <hi>Oblation;</hi> save what
flows from the Nobleness of the <hi>Subjest,</hi> and
the sincerity of his respects who presents it.
It is truly a part of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> that was
<pb facs="tcp:106992:4"/>
never much Cultivated, but of late, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in a more abstract and subtil way, which
did render it less useful; but is now more
improven by sensible <hi>Manifestations</hi> of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Mistriss of Arts, NATURE her self.
There are indeed (my Lord) many excellent
<hi>Sciences,</hi> which do merit the favour of your
Lordships studies, and by which your Noble
Accomplishments might be more improven;
yet I am bold to affirm, you cannot apply your
<hi>Noble Mind</hi> to any part of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> where
you will find more Pleasure, with less Pains;
more evidence of Reason, with less Difficulty.</p>
            <p>The famous <hi>Gregorio Leti,</hi> was so much an
admirer of your <hi>Vertues,</hi> that he sheltered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your <hi>Patrociny,</hi> his <hi>Vita Di Sisto quinto Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefece
Romano.</hi> And if you were able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
an envyed <hi>Italian</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> much more may
I expect full security from your Name in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> where your interest and relations are
so considerable. And if he, who only look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your <hi>Vertuous Mind,</hi> while it was but blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soming,
was so much perswaded to judge none
<pb facs="tcp:106992:4"/>
more fit to Receive, Protect, and Claim his
<hi>Labours,</hi> much more <hi>I,</hi> who have seen the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of your <hi>Vertues at home. I</hi>
have likewise very much confidence of your
Noble and Candid Disposition to admit this
into your <hi>Favour,</hi> and assurance of your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and Skill, to Love it, and Understand
it; both which are conspicuous, the first in
your encouragement to all <hi>Learning,</hi> the other
in your Capacity and Understanding to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
whatever you encourage.</p>
            <p>Though (my Lord) I have been much
emboldened to offer this <hi>Dedication</hi> to your
Lordship, upon the account of your own <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
Vertues,</hi> yet <hi>I</hi> must not pass over in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
a most special Motive, which to me shall
be the last, sparing to express all the great
Causes oblieging me so to do, and that is, the
Memory of your VVorthy and nearest <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi>

and <hi>Great-Grand-father,</hi> not only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable

for these many years, but for the <hi>Dignity,</hi> and
<hi>Antiquity</hi> of their famous <hi>Ancestours.</hi> How old
your Lordships Name is, <hi>Buchanan</hi> testifies in
the close of the <hi>Second Book</hi> of his <hi>History,</hi> who
writeth thus, <hi>Certè Gildus vetus est in Scotia No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
ut vetus Mackgildorum, sive Mackgillorum
gens indicat: è cujus posteris honestae adhuc in Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia

Gild <hi>is an ancient Name in</hi> Scotland, <hi>as witness
the old Family of</hi> Mackgilds, <hi>or</hi> Mackgills:
<hi>of whose Posterity there are yet in</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi>
England <hi>many Families of good account.</hi> And
as an instance of this, the same Author tells
us of the Great <hi>Thane of</hi> Galloway, <hi>Mackgil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum

<hi>Mackbeth,</hi> who by this <hi>Vsurper</hi> was put to

whom your Lordship, and your worthy <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors</hi>
are Lineally descended, and of whom

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall not detain thee entry with a long <hi>Preface,</hi>
but give a short account of what is needful to be known,
of the <hi>Cause, Occasion,</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> of the following
Treatise. After the publication of my last <hi>Piece,</hi> about
the <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Pressure</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> I found it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to treat of the <hi>Pressure</hi> of the <hi>Water,</hi> because of the near relation
between the two: the operations, and effects of both depending almost
upon the same <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Causes.</hi> And that there are many things,
which cannot throughly be understood, of the <hi>Pressure</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi>
without the knowledge of the <hi>Pressure</hi> of the <hi>Water:</hi> therefore to
make the first the more evident, I have spoken of the second: the
effects and operations of <hi>Hydrostatical Experiments,</hi> being more
conspicuous and sensible, then the effects and operations of the other.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Occasion</hi> was some spare time I had now and then, for making
some <hi>Trials:</hi> part whereof are published here; the rest being rather
some productions of Reason, attentively exercised on that Subject;
which notwithstanding may be called <hi>Experiments,</hi> though never
actually tried, nor haply can be, because of some accidental impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments:
yet supposing they were, I make it evident, that such and
such <hi>Phenomena</hi> would follow, whence many necessary conclusions are
inferred.</p>
            <p>As for the subject matter, there are first, moe then thirty <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rems</hi>
in order to the <hi>Pressure</hi> of <hi>Fluid Bodies,</hi> as <hi>Air, Water,</hi> and
<hi>Mercury,</hi> which in effect are nothing else, but so many conclusions
rationally deduced from various and diverse effects of <hi>Aerostatical,
Hydrostatical,</hi> and <hi>Hydrargyrostatical Experiments,</hi> which for the
most part, I have tried my self.</p>
            <p>There are next twenty <hi>Experiments</hi> briefly described, by their own
<pb facs="tcp:106992:7"/>
distinct <hi>Schematisms:</hi> their <hi>Phenomena,</hi> according to the Laws of
the <hi>Hydrostaticks</hi> are <hi>salved,</hi> and several new conclusions inferred. A
<hi>Proposal</hi> is likewise made of a more convenient <hi>Engine</hi> for <hi>Diving.</hi>
Here, several difficulties are proposed, and answered, and all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
<hi>Phenomena</hi> of <hi>Diving</hi> explicated. If the <hi>Lead</hi> which sinks the
Ark, be judged too weighty, and big, which may render it not so
tractable, and likewise hinder the <hi>Ark</hi> from going so near to the
ground, as is desirable, and in some measure stop the sight, (which
troubles are (I suppose) incident to the <hi>Bell</hi> also) it may be reduced
to a far less weight, and quantity, and the overplus being made
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quare and thin pieces, may line the mouth of the <hi>Ark</hi> without, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
P Q and L M, according to the Figure 25, or may be put to,
or taken away at pleasure. The <hi>Bell</hi> may have likewise in stead of
this troublesome <hi>Foot-board,</hi> a weighty <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Lead,</hi> or two, to go
round about the orifice without, in form of a <hi>Girth,</hi> or <hi>Belt,</hi> which may
slip off and on at pleasure, and will as conveniently sink it, as if it
had a weight appended: the <hi>Foot-board</hi> then may be of any form,
quantity, or weight you please.</p>
            <p>There are thirdly some <hi>Miscellany Observations,</hi> the design of
which is only <hi>Philosophical.</hi> Some of them are <hi>Experiments</hi> made
with the <hi>Air-pump,</hi> which I have adventured to insert here, even
though the Noble <hi>Mr. Boyl</hi> hath given an account of many. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>Engine</hi> was offered to me by the <hi>Laird of Salton,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of a choise Spirit, I could not, but in obedience to his commands
make use of it, and shew him the Product. There are also two or three
Observations in the close, as that of the <hi>Primum vivens</hi> in <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals:</hi>
of the <hi>Aliment, and growth of plants:</hi> and of the <hi>motion of the
Aliment in Trees.</hi> To all which is added a short <hi>History of Coal,</hi> which
I hope will be acceptable to some; this so needful a subject, never being
treated of before by any. In it, mention is made of things common to
<hi>Coal</hi> in general, as <hi>Dipps, Rifings,</hi> and <hi>Streeks.</hi> Next, of <hi>Gaes,</hi> or
<hi>Dykes,</hi> which prove so troublesome sometimes to the working of <hi>Coal.</hi>
Thirdly, of <hi>Damps,</hi> and <hi>Wild-fire.</hi> Next, a method is taught for
trying of Grounds, where never any <hi>Coal</hi> was discovered before. And
lastly, the manner how <hi>Levels,</hi> or <hi>Conduits</hi> under-ground, ought to
be carried on, for draining the <hi>Coal,</hi> and freeing it of Water.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:106992:7"/>
When this Book was first committed to the <hi>Press,</hi> I sent an <hi>intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
thereof to some of my friends, for their encouragment to it, a
Practice now common, and commendable, which hath not wanted a
considerable success, as witness the respect of many worthy persons, to
whom I am oblidged. But there is a <hi>Generation,</hi> that rather, than
they will encourage any new <hi>Invention,</hi> set themselves by all means to
detract from it, and the <hi>Authors</hi> of it: so grieved are they, that
ought of this kind should fall into the hands of any, but their own.
And therefore, if the Author shall give but the title of <hi>New</hi> to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
though never so deservedly, <hi>they fly presently in his throat,
like so many Wild-Catts,</hi> studying either to <hi>Ridicule</hi> his work alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
a trade that usually, the person of weakest abilities, and most
empty heads, are better at, than learned men, like those Schollars, who
being nimble in putting tricks, and impostures upon their Condisciples,
were dolts, as to their Lesson, or else fall upon it with such snarling,
and carping, as discover, neither ingenuity, nor ingeniousness, but a
sore sickness, called <hi>Envy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Intimation,</hi> I affirmed, that the Doctrine concerning the
<hi>Weight,</hi> and <hi>Pressure</hi> of the <hi>Water</hi> was <hi>New.</hi> This one word, like
a spark of Fire falling accidentally among Powder, hath been the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of so much debate. Their ground is, because they look upon the
<hi>Hydrostaticks,</hi> as a <hi>Science long ago perfected,</hi> seing <hi>Archimedes</hi>
2000 years ago hath demonstrat the <hi>Water</hi> to have a <hi>Pressure,</hi> and
some others since, as <hi>Stevinus.</hi> They affirm likewise, that all the
<hi>Theorems,</hi> and <hi>Experiments,</hi> that are here, are either deduceable from
<hi>Archimedes,</hi> and <hi>Stevinus,</hi> or are the same with theirs. If these
Gentlemen had suspended their judgment, till this Book had been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
I suspect they would not have spoken so confidently. For <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes</hi>
his proposition; they are but few, and proven (as <hi>Mr Boyl</hi>
saith) <hi>by no very easie demonstrations, which have more of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical
subtility, than usefulness in them.</hi> But these, which are here
proposed, are not only useful, but evidently evicted by reason, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Experiments, even to the meanest capacities. And though
some of mine, may (perhaps) co-incide with some of his, which to me
is but accidental, yet our way of procedour is <hi>toto Coelo</hi> different.
His way is more <hi>Speculative:</hi> this is more <hi>Practical.</hi> His demonstrations
<pb facs="tcp:106992:8"/>
are <hi>Geometrical:</hi> these are <hi>Physical.</hi> His propositions are but for
the <hi>use of a few:</hi> these are for the <hi>use of all.</hi> His are not illustrated,
and confirmed by <hi>Hydrostatical Experiments:</hi> these are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stevinus</hi> a late Writer keeps that same method. Yet I judge it
easie to let see, even in the entry, how little cogent some of his demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
are, without derogating from such a Learned Man. He
hath indeed some <hi>Pragmatical Examples</hi> (as he calls them) for il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrating
some of his <hi>Geometrical Propositions,</hi> anent the <hi>Pressure</hi>
of the <hi>Water;</hi> but I leave them to be considered by the judicious and
understanding. Again, in this <hi>Method,</hi> I am yet as much different
from others, who have written lately, as from these I have been speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of. For, I not only treat of the <hi>Pressure</hi> of the <hi>Water,</hi> but takes
in with it, the <hi>Pressure</hi> of the <hi>Air</hi> joyntly; since to explicat suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
the <hi>Phenomena</hi> of the <hi>Hydrostaticks,</hi> without it, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
And yet fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Air</hi> with <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> with <hi>Mercury,</hi> by which means several
mysteries, and secrets in this Art, are discovered.</p>
            <p>There are several Inventions found out of late in the <hi>Hydrosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
whose events and effects, cannot be clearly deduced from the
grounds of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> and <hi>Stevinus,</hi> who had not that clear disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

               </gap> we know) of the <hi>Pressure of the Air,</hi> that some now
have, without which, these effects can never be sufficiently explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And who doubts, but others afterwards, may make farder disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
and profit the world yet more, with their Inventions, then any
have yet done. Is then the <hi>Hydrostaticks, a Science long ago perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi>
To this <hi>Pedantick</hi> Conceit, I must again oppose the judgment
of <hi>Mr. Boyl,</hi> who saith moreover, that <hi>the usefulness of this part of
Philosophy hath been scarce known any farder than by name, even
to the generality of learned men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us suppose, that the <hi>notion</hi> of the <hi>Pressure</hi> of the <hi>Water,</hi> is of
an old date, even as old as the <hi>Flood</hi> (for <hi>Noah</hi> surely knew, that the
<hi>Pressure of the Water,</hi> would sustain the <hi>Ark</hi>) and (giving, but
not granting) that <hi>Archimedes</hi> 2000 years ago hath written all the
<hi>Principles of the Hydrostaticks,</hi> doth this hinder any man now, from
deducing <hi>new Conclusions</hi> from these <hi>old Principles?</hi> But there
is here, no such thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for neither in this, nor in my last <hi>Piece,</hi> are my
<pb facs="tcp:106992:8"/>
               <hi>Adversaries</hi> able to <hi>trace me.</hi> 'Tis like the purposes would have been
so much the better, if I had followed other mens foot steps: and it is
like they might have been so much the worse. I doubt not, but I have
lighted upon other mens thoughts in some things: and others writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on this same subject, who perhaps are my <hi>Antipodes,</hi> may fall
upon mine. My <hi>Antagonists</hi> affirm, they are able to deduce all my
<hi>Theorems,</hi> and the <hi>events</hi> of all my <hi>Experiments</hi> from the grounds of
<hi>Archimedes</hi> and <hi>Stevinus.</hi> If <hi>they take not their word again,</hi> I
hope they will do it; for now I put them to it. And though they should,
(which I am not affraid they shall do in haste) yet they must prove
next, that these <hi>Theorems</hi> and <hi>Conclusions,</hi> so deduced, are not <hi>new,</hi>
which all their <hi>Logick</hi> will not prove. But what if we do more, (<hi>say
they</hi>) even overthrow many of all your <hi>Aerostatical</hi> and <hi>Hydrostatical
Experiments,</hi> in this, and in your last <hi>Peice?</hi> I give you liberty, and for
your hire, a <hi>Guiny</hi> for each <hi>Theorem,</hi> or <hi>Experiment,</hi> you are able
to ransack, in either of the two Books, though they come near to an
hundred. But, ye must oblige your selves (<hi>my Masters</hi>) to do it with
<hi>Reason,</hi> laying aside your <hi>Sophistry</hi> and <hi>Canina eloquentia.</hi> And
this I offer, Reader, that I may reduce them, to a better <hi>humour,</hi> and
encourage them to leave off <hi>flyting,</hi> and only use reason. Neither
must they be like the <hi>Wasp,</hi> that only lights upon the <hi>sore place.</hi> But
if they love to kindle any more fire, they will find me proof against it.
If it burn them, it shall not heat me. Nevertheless, if they love to
<hi>juik</hi> under deck, <hi>like Green-horns,</hi> having no courage in themselves,
or confidence in their cause, they must excuse me, if at last, I write
their names upon a Ticket, and bring them above deck. This is all
I have to say, at present (<hi>Reader</hi>) and I bid thee farewell.</p>

               </gap>ations depends upon Mechanical Principles. But in
<pb facs="tcp:106992:11"/>
several respects it is far more admirable, than the most part
of the Mechan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cal Engines, which are look'd upon as stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious.
Many things, almost incredible, are reported of
<hi>Archimedes,</hi> which he admirably brought about, by his
Mechanical <hi>Powers;</hi> but I am confident, that by this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi>
as great a weight may be lifted, if not greater,
as the <hi>Power</hi> of any Mechanical Faculty can be able to
move. I know, the greatest conceivable weight, may
be demonstrat, to be moved by the least conceivable
Power, as the <hi>Earth,</hi> by the <hi>force of a mans hand.</hi> But
how is it possible to contrive Artificially, an Engine for
that purpose, which will do that by <hi>Art,</hi> which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
makes evident by reason? It was thought a
great enterprize, when <hi>Pope Sixtus</hi> the fifth, transported
an <hi>Obelisk,</hi> which had been long since dedicated to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of <hi>Iulius Cesar,</hi> from the left side of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> to
a more eminent place, 100 foot distant; but to raise a
Ship of 1000 Tun intirely, nay, a weight 100 times
greater, is surely a far greater enterprize. This <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is so much the more admirable, that not only by it,
any supposed weight may be lifted, but from any deepness.
Though this (perhaps) cannot be done Mechanically,
because of some <hi>Physical,</hi> or <hi>Moral</hi> impediment, yet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Hydrostaticks</hi> it can be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat,
and made evident by reason. And if this be, then
surely, when the <hi>Weight</hi> is determinat, as the burdens of
all <hi>Ships</hi> are, and the deepness known to be within so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
fathoms, this <hi>Invention</hi> cannot but be successful.</p>
            <p>Though the <hi>strength</hi> of <hi>Mechanical Inventions,</hi> may be
multiplied, beyond the bounds of our <hi>Imagination,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the greatest <hi>Weight,</hi> may be moved, by the least
<hi>Power;</hi> yet the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> hath thought it fit, so to
confine that knowledge, that it cannot teach, how both
<pb facs="tcp:106992:11"/>
of them, can move with the same <hi>quickness</hi> and <hi>speed.</hi> For,
if that were, the very works of Nature might be overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Therefore, it is observable, that when a great <hi>Weight</hi>
is moved by a small <hi>Power,</hi> the motion of the one, is as
much slower than the motion of the other, as the <hi>Weight</hi>
of the one, exceeds the <hi>Force</hi> of the other. If it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<hi>Mechanically</hi> to move the <hi>Earth</hi> with the <hi>Force</hi> of a
mans hand, the motion thereof would be as much slower,
than the motion of the hand, as the <hi>Weight</hi> of the one, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
the <hi>Force</hi> of the other, which is a great disadvantage.
And as the <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> do thus differ, as to <hi>swiftness,</hi>
and <hi>slowness</hi> in motion, so also, as to <hi>Space.</hi> For, by how
much the <hi>Power</hi> is in it self less, than the <hi>Weight,</hi> by so much
will the bounds or <hi>Space,</hi> the <hi>Weight</hi> moves thorow, be less
than the <hi>Space,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> goes thorow. If it were possible
(keeping the same instance) to move the <hi>Earth</hi> with a mans
hand, the <hi>Space</hi> thorow which it passeth, would differ as
much from the <hi>Space</hi> the hand goes thorow, as the one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
the other; which is another disadvantage.</p>
            <p>It may be thought, that if this <hi>Invention</hi> depend upon
<hi>Mechanical Principles,</hi> it may be obnoxious to these abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
I answer, though there be in it a <hi>Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dus,</hi> and a <hi>Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
a <hi>Weight,</hi> and a <hi>Power,</hi> this moving the other, yet it will
evidently appear from Experience, that the motion of the
one, is as swift as the motion of the other, and that the one
moves as much <hi>Space</hi> and bounds in the same time, as the
other, which is a great advantage. In this, it excells all the
<hi>Mechanical Powers,</hi> and <hi>Faculties,</hi> that have ever yet been
invented and practised. If any think, that such a device
cannot be effectuat, without a considerable expence. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
the expence is so small, that I am ashamed to mention
it. The method and manner of doing this, is most easie
likewise. Neither ought this to be a ground, why any man
<pb facs="tcp:106992:12"/>
should contemn it; since the most useful Inventions ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
are performed with the greatest facility.</p>
            <p>As it commends this part of <hi>Philosophy</hi> to all ingenious
<hi>Spirits,</hi> as most pleasant, and most profitable, so it gives
a check to the <hi>ignorant,</hi> who look upon it as <hi>a Science long
ago perfected.</hi>

one another according to their thickness: for
though the one Pillar of Water be ten times thicker, then

Water, unless it be in very deep parts, near the bottom,

the Air upon the tops of Mountains, and high places, is
thought to be of a less Pressure, then in Valleys: and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

For, though the one Leg, be sixteen inches long,

               <p>THe reason of this Proposition must be taken from
the nature of an <hi>equipondium,</hi> or equal weight. For
without doubt, there is a counter-ballance between the
Pressure of the Water, and the weight of the body that
swims. To make this probable, let us suppose there were

way, without weight. In this case, the under-surface
of that four-squar'd body, being applied to the surface of

it being void of weight, the part of the surface A, would

whence no motion would follow. Here is no <hi>equipondium,</hi>
or counter-ballance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let us suppose the said body to acquire two

so far, till it come by vertue of its new acquired weight, to
a counter-ballance with the Pressure of the Water. Which
Pressure is nothing else, but as much force or weight, as is
equivalent to the weight of Water, that is thrust out of
its own place, by the subsiding and sinking of that body,
two inches.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let us suppose the same body to acquire other
two ounces of weight, then must it subside other two
inches. Lastly, let us suppose that it acquires six ounces
of weight, then it follows that the whole body sinks, so
far, I mean, till its upmost surface be in an <hi>Horizontal line</hi>
with the surface of the Water A B C D. Here it swims
also, because the weight of it becomes just the weight of
so much Water, as it hath put out of its own place. I say,
it must swim, because if the Water I, was able to sustain
the Water E, which is put from its own place, surely it
must be able to sustain that body also, that did thrust it
from its own place, seing both are of the same weight,
namely six ounces. In this case, the body immerged,
and the water wherein it is drowned, become of the same
weight <hi>specifically,</hi> seing bulk for bulk is of the same
weight. To make this body <hi>specifically,</hi> or naturally hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
then Water, and consequently to sink to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
nothing is required, but to suppose that it acquires
one ounce more of weight; which done, it presently goes
down, I, being more burdened then K. Note by the
way, a twofold weight in heavy bodies, one <hi>individual,</hi>
the other <hi>specifick,</hi> and that two bodies agreeing in <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual</hi>

               <p>FOr clearing this Proposition, let us suppose F to be a
four-square piece of Timber, of the same <hi>specifick</hi> and
natural weight with Water, and consequently its upper sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to be level with the surface of the Water A B C D. I
say then, if it be prest down to R, it shall arise thence, and
never rest till it be where it was, namely in F. The reason
seems to be this, because the four-squar'd body of Water R,
is really heavier, then the four-squar'd piece of Timber F.
If this be true, it follows of necessity, that it must ascend:
for if the Timber existing in R, be lighter then the Water R,
the Water T must be less prest, then the Water O, or the
Water V; whence (according to the twelfth Theorem)
<hi>motion must follow.</hi> Again, if the Timber R, existing in the
Water R, be lighter then the same Water is, then must
the Water K, be more prest up then the Water I, or L;
whence yet, according to the same Theorem, <hi>motion must
follow.</hi> If it be said, that the Timber F, is of the same
weight with the Water R, because, it being equal in
weight with the Water F, which it hath thrust out of its
own place, it must also be equal in weight to the Water R,
seeing F and R being of the same dimensions, are of the
same weight. There is no way to answer this difficulty,
unless I say the four-squar'd body of water R, is really and
truly heavier then the four-squar'd body of Water F. The
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106992:20"/>
reason seems to be, because the Water R, is under a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Pressure, then the Water F; and by vertue of this
greater Pressure, there are really <hi>moe parts</hi> of Water in it,
then in F; therefore it must be heavier. Even as there are
far moe parts of Air, in one cubick foot near the <hi>Earth,</hi> then
in six or seven near the <hi>Atmosphere.</hi> Hence it is, that
a pint of Water taken from the bottom of the Sea, fourty
fathom deep, will be heavier, I mean in a ballance, then a
pint taken from the surface. Take notice, that when the
vessel is once full at the bottom, the orifice must be closely
stopped, till it come to the top: otherwise the parts that
are compressed at the bottom, namely by the weight of
the superiour parts, relaxes themselves, before they come

               <p>FOr understanding this, suppose F to be a four-square
piece of Timber, which though it will not rest but at
the surface, A B C D, yet may be made to go down of its
own accord, and rest at T, namely, by making it so
much heavier, as the Water T is heavier then the Water
F. To know this difference, which is not very practicable;
the Cube of Water T, must be brought from its own place,
under the same degree of Pressure it hath, and put into the
Scale of a Ballance, and weighed with the Cube of Water
F, put into the other Scale. Now if the Water T, be
half an ounce heavier, then the Water F, then to make
the Timber F hing in T, it must be made half an ounce
heavier. There seems to be reason for it also; for if a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106992:20"/>
Cube of Timber resting in the space T, be just the weight
of the Water T, the <hi>imaginary</hi> surface O T V, is no more
prest, then if T were Water, and so it cannot go down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
neither can it go upward, seing the under part of
the Water R, is no more prest up by the Timber T, then
if the space T were filled with Water. If it be said, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this reasoning, a Stone may be suspended in a deep
Water, between the top and the bottom, which is absurd.
I answer, such a thing may happen in a very deep Water:
For put the case a Cube of Lead twelve inches every way,
were to go down twelve thousand fathom, it is probable,
it would be suspended before it came to the ground. For
coming to an <hi>imaginary</hi> surface far down, where the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is great, a Cube of Water twelve inches thick there,
may be as heavy (even <hi>specifically</hi>) as the Cube of Lead
is, though the Lead be ten times heavier <hi>specifically,</hi> then
any foot of VVater at the top. If Water suffer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of parts, by the superiour burden; it is more then
probable, that the second foot of Water burdened with
the first, hath moe parts in it, then are in the first, and the
third moe, then in the second, and so forth; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that the second is heavier, then the first, and the
third heavier, then the second. Now, if this be, why
may not that foot of Water, that hath sixty thousand
foot above it, by vertue of this burden, be so comprest,
that in it may be as many parts, as may counter-ballance a
Cube of Lead twelve inches every way? If then, that <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary</hi>
surface, that is sixty thousand foot deep, be able to
sustain the said foot of VVater, which perhaps weighs
twenty pound, why may it not likewise sustain the Lead,
that is both of the same dimensions with it, and weight?
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106992:21"/>

Paradox, yet it seems to be true: for though the

happens (as I said) from the superiour Pressure. It is clear
also from this, namely the Cube of Timber E, which

then is, why doth it lose half a pound of its weight? I
answer, the stone becomes half a pound lighter, because
the surface of Water on which it rests, sustains half a pound
of it: For put the case a stone were resting in R, that weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
two pound and an half in the Air, it behoved to weigh
but two pound in this Water; because the Water T su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stains
half a pound of it. For if this Water T be able to
sustain the Water R, that weighs half a pound, it must
be also able to sustain half a pound of the stone, seing half
a pound of stone is no heavier, then half a pound of Water.
Note, that when a heavy body is weighed in Water, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
so much lighter exactly, as is the weight of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it thrusts out of its own place.</p>

Figure 1.</head>
               <p>FOr clearing this proposition, I must suppose from the
17. Theorem, that the lower the parts of Water
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106992:22"/>
be, they are the heavier, though all of them be of equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions.
If then the lowest foot Q be heavier, that is,
have moe parts in it, then the foot N, it of necessity fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that a stone suspended in Q, must be lighter then
while it is suspended in N or I. Because, if a stone be
lighter in Water then in Air, as is said, even by as much, as
is the weight of the bulk of Water, that the bulk of the
stone expells, then surely it must be lighter in the one, then
in the other place; because suspended in Q, it expells
moe parts of Water, then while it is suspended in N or I.
For example, let us suppose the Water N, to weigh eight
ounces, and the Water Q to weigh nine, then must the
stone suspended in Q, weigh less by an ounce, then
suspended in N, seeing as much is deduced from the weight
of the stone, as is the weight of the Water it expells: but
so it is, that it thrusts nine ounces of Water out of its own
place in Q, and but eight in N or I; therefore it must
be one ounce lighter in the one place, then in the other.
This may be tried, with a nice, and accurat ballance, which
will bring us to the knowledge of this, namely how much
the foot of Water Q is heavier, then the Water N or O.</p>

true, not only in order to this artificial Pressure, but in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the natural Pressure, and <hi>Bensil</hi> of the Air likewise.
For the Air within a parlour, hath all its parts, under the

lye in the same Horizontal surface, yet to speak strictly, it
will not hold true of the parts scituated under divers sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces;
for without question, the foot of VVater T, must
be under four degrees of Pressure, if the VVater R, be
under three. And if the Air in the lowest story of a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

kind, not only between the first, and second fathom of Air,

Figure 1.</head>
               <p>THis Theorem may seem hard, yet it can be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
by many instances: for albeit the quantity
of Air, that fills a Parlour, be little in respect of the whole
Element, yet surely, there is as much Pressure in it, as in
the whole; because Experience shews, that the <hi>Mercurial
Cylinder</hi> in the <hi>Baroscope,</hi> will be as well sustained in a
Chamber, as without, and under the whole <hi>Atmosphere</hi>
directly; which could not be, unless the small portion of
Air, that's in this Parlour, had as much Pressure in it, as
in the whole Element. Besides this, it will be found in a
far less quantity: for though the <hi>Baroscope</hi> were inclosed,
and imprisoned so closs, within a small Vessel, that the
Air within, could have no communion with the Air with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
yet the Pressure of that very small quantity, will
sustain 29. inches of Mercury, and this will come to pass,
even though the whole Element of Air were annihilated.
This Proposition is likewise evident in order to the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Water: for put the case, the <hi>Baroscope,</hi> whose
Mercurial Cylinder is 29. inches, by the Pressure of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106992:23"/>
Air; were sent down to the bottom of a Sea 34. foot deep,
within a Vessel, as a Hogs-head, and there exactly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed,
that the VVater within, could have no commerce
with the VVater without, yet as well, after this shutting
up, as before, other 29. inches would be sustained, by the
Pressure of this imprisoned VVater, which proves evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that there is as much Pressure in one Hogs-head full of
VVater, at the bottom of the Sea, as in the whole Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of VVater, above, or about: for an Element of
VVater never so spacious, if it exceed not 34. foot in
deepness, can sustain no more Mercury, then 29. inches
by its Pressure. Yea, though the Vessel with the <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope,</hi>
and imprisoned VVater in it, were brought above
to the free Air, yet will the VVater retain the same Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and will <hi>de facto</hi> sustain 29. inches of Mercury, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
the Vessel be kept closs. It is therefore evident,
that as much Pressure may be in one small quantity of
VVater, as in the whole Element, or Ocean. 'Tis to
be observed, that this Theorem is to be understood chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the lower parts of Fluids; seing there cannot be so
much Pressure in the VVater P, as in the VVater Q; for
in effect, there is as much Pressure in the VVater Q, as
is in the whole VVater above it, or about it. From this
Theorem, we see evidently, that the Pressure, and <hi>Bensil</hi>
of a Fluid, is not to be measured, according to its bulk,
and quantity, seing there is as much <hi>Bensil</hi> in one foot,
nay, in one inch of Air, as is in the whole Element, and as
strong a Pressure in one foot of VVater, or less, as there
is in the whole Ocean: therefore the greatest quantity of
Air, hath not alwayes the greatest <hi>Bensil,</hi> neither the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

               <head type="sub">The Pressure, and Bensil of a Fluid, is a thing, really distinct
from the natural weight of a Fluid.
Figure 1.</head>
               <p>THis may be easily conceived; for as in solid bodies,
the <hi>Bensil,</hi> and <hi>natural weight,</hi> are two distinct
things, so is it in Air, and Water, or in any other Fluid,
The weight of a <hi>Bow,</hi> is one thing, and the <hi>natural weight</hi>
of it, is another. The weight of the Spring of a <hi>Watch,</hi> and
the <hi>Bensil</hi> of it, are two distinct things. The weight (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps)
will not exceed two ounces: but the <hi>Bensil</hi> (may
be) will be equivalent to two pound. Though these
may illustrate, yet they do not convince: therefore I shall
adduce a reason, and it's this. The <hi>natural weight</hi> of a
Fluid is less, or more, as the quantity is less or more; but
it is not so with the Pressure, because there may be as
much Pressure in a small quantity, as in a great, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from the last Theorem, therefore they may be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.
The first part of the Argument is manifest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is more weight in a gallon of Water, then in
a pint. A second reason is, because a Fluid may lose of its
pressure, without losing of its weight. This is evident
from the Schematism, for if you take away the four foot of
Water E F G H, and consequently make the four Pillars
shorter, the foot of Water Q becomes of less Pressure,
but not of less Weight, seeing the quantity still remains
the same: at least, the loss of weight is not comparable,
to the loss of Pressure. I say, it becomes of less Pressure,
because there is a less burden above it. Thirdly, the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106992:24"/>
and <hi>Bensil</hi> may be intended, and made stronger, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any alteration in the weight: so is the <hi>Bensil</hi> of Air,
within a Bladder, made stronger by heat, without any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
in the weight of it. Likewise, the Pressure of the
foot of Water Q, may be made stronger, by making
these four pillars higher, without any alteration, at least
considerable, in the weight; for it still remains a foot of
water, whatever be the hight of the pillars above it. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the weight of a Fluid is <hi>essential</hi> to it, but the Pressure
is only <hi>accidental;</hi> because it is only generated, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
in the inferiour parts, by the weight of the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
which weight may be taken away.</p>

               <p>FOr understanding this Proposition, let us imagine
G H C D to be a Vessel, in whose bottom, there
are five inches of Mercury E F C D. Next, that above
the stagnant Mercury, there are thirty four foot of Water
resting, namely A B E F. Lastly, that upon the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the said Water, there is resting the Element of
Air G H A B, whose top G H, I reckon to be about
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106992:26"/>
six thousand fathom above A B. Besides these, let us
imagine, that there are here three Pipes, open at both ends,
the first whereof C A G, having it's lower orifice C,
drowned among the stagnant Mercury E F C D, goeth
so high, that theu pper orifice goeth above the top of the
Air G H. The second, whose lower orifice I, is only drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
among the Water A B E F, reaches to the top of the
Air likewise. The third, whose open end K, is above
the surface of the VVater A N B, and hanging in
the open Air, goeth likewise above the Atmosphere.
These things being supposed, we see that no Fluid can,
by its own proper weight, press any part of it self, higher
then it's own surface, seing the stagnant Mercury E F C D,
cannot press it self within the Pipe C G, higher then E.
Neither can the VVater A B E F, press it self higher
within the Pipe I L, then the point N. Lastly, neither
can the Air G H A B, press it self within the Pipe K M,
higher then M. But when one Fluid presseth upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as the VVater A B E F, upon the Mercury E F C D,
then doth the said Mercury ascend higher than it's own
surface, namely from E to O, which point is the highest,
to which the thirty four foot of VVater A B E F, can
raise the Mercury, which altitude, is twenty nine inches
above the surface E I F. But if a second Fluid be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added,
as the whole Air G H A B, then must the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
according to that new Pressure, rise by proportion;
so rises the Mercury from O to P, other twenty nine
inches. By this same additional weight of Air, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
rises thirty four foot in the Pipe I L, namely from N
to R. Now, I say, the outmost and highest point, to
which the Element of Air G H A B can raise the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
is from O to P; for by the Pressure of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

A B E F, it rises from E to O. And the highest
point, to which the said Air can raise the VVater, is from
N to R. The reasons of these determinate altitudes,
must be sought for, from the altitudes of the incumbing
and pressing Fluids: for as these are less or more, so is the
altitude of the Mercury, and of the VVater within the
Pipes more or less. The hight therefore of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
E O, is twenty nine inches, because the deepness of
the pressing water A B E F is thirty four foot. And the
hight of the VVater N R, is thirty four foot, because the

               <p>THis Proposition is true, not only of VVater in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

both: for albeit Air be a thousand times lighter then
VVater, yet may it have as great a Pressure with it, as

twenty nine inches of Mercury O P are supported, as

it would exactly counterpoise the thirty four foot of Water

through all the intermediat parts: for not only the VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Q loseth a degree of its Pressure, but the VVaters P
and O suffer the same loss. This Theorem holds true
likewise in order to the Element of Air. For if by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

than it is; then surely, the <hi>Bensil</hi> of the ambient Air, that

also. And contrariwise, if the Altitude became more,
then stronger should the <hi>Bensil</hi> be here, with us, in the
lowest parts: both which would be hurtful to creatures,
that live by breathing. For if the Altitude of the Air,
were far more then it is, our bodies would be under a far
greater Pressure, which surely would be very hurtful. And
upon the other hand, if the Altitude of the Air, were far
less then it is, we should be at a greater loss; for then, by

they are heavier, because they are thicker. I answer, they
are truly heavier, for the Pillar of Air F B apart, will be

therefore, seing the slender Pillar of Air I G, is as
high, as either F B, or E A, it cannot be prest up by
them. For by vertue of this equal hight, all the three
press equally and uniformly, upon the surface of Water
A B; and therefore according to the twelfth Theorem,
there can be no motion. But if so be, the Pillar F B,
were higher then the Pillar I G, then surely would
the Water H I, be prest up; for in such a case, there is
an unequal Pressure. Or if the Pillar I G, were higher
then the Pillar F B, then surely would the Water I H be
prest down, there being again an unequal Pressure: the
Water within the Pipe, being more burdened then the
Water about the Pipe. In a word, there's no more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
here, then if the Pipe were taken away: in which
case, there would be but one Pillar of Air, resting upon
the surface of Water A B. If it be said, the Pipe being
thrust down, makes of one Pillar, three distinct ones, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106992:28"/>
consequently a formal counter-ballance, or mutual susten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Be it so, yet because all these press uniformly,
there can be no motion.</p>

               <p>FOr proving this Proposition, let us suppose A B C D,
to be a large Vessel full of VVater, as high as A N B,
and a little Vessel lying within it, near to the bottom, closs
above at M, but with an open orifice downward, as G,
and having other two passages going in to it, upon the
right, and left side, as E O, and F P. Now, I say, the
Pressure of this VVater, is not only from N to M, in a
<hi>Straight</hi> line downwards, but from E to O, and from F
to P, by crooked lines. Nay, put the case this Vessel had
no passage in to it, but by a <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> or entry full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
windings, yet the Pressure will be communicated,
thorow all these, even to the middle of it: and which is
more, the VVater H or I, within the Vessel, would be
under the same degree of Pressure, with the VVater E or
L, without, or with the VVater K or F. And which
is strange, let us suppose both the entries E and F stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and nothing remaining open, but the hole G, which
I judge no wider, then may admit the hair of ones head,
yet thorow that smal hole, shall the Pressure be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,

as if the upper part of the Vessel E M L, were cut

in order to Water, the same is true in order to Air, or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,

               <p>FOr understanding this Proposition, let us suppose E F
to be the lowest foot of a Pillar of Air, cut off from
the rest, and inclosed in the Vessel E F, six inches in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter,
or wideness, and twelve inches high. Now I say, the
<hi>Bensil</hi> and Pressure, that's in that one foot of Air, is exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of as great force and power, as is the weight of the whole
Pillar of Air, from which it was cut off. Let A B be
that Pillar of Air, which I suppose is six inches thick, and
six thousand fathom high. Take it, and weigh it in a Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
and say it weighs 500 pound, yet the Pressure, and
<hi>Bensil,</hi> that's in the Air E F, is of as much force: and if
the one be of strength by its weight, to move, <hi>v. g.</hi> a great
<hi>Clock,</hi> the other by its <hi>Bensil,</hi> will be of as much. This
proposition is true also in order to Water. For put the
case E F, were the lowest of 34 foot of Water: in it will
be found as much Pressure, and force, as will be equivalent
to the weight of the whole thirty three foot, from which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106992:29"/>
it was cut off. But here occurreth a difficulty; for if the
Pressure, and <hi>Bensil</hi> of the foot of Air E F, be equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to the weight of the whole Pillar of Air A B, which
weighs 500 pound, then must the slender Pillar of Air
C D, that's but two inches in diameter, be as heavy
weighed in a ballance, as the thicker Pillar A B, which is
absurd. I prove the connexion of the two parts of the
Argument thus: as the Bensil of the Air G H, is to the
Bensil of the Air E F, so is the weight of the Pillar C D,
to the weight of the Pillar A B: but so it is, that the
Bensil of the Air G H, is equal in degree to the Bensil
of the Air E F, according to the Theorem 21. Where
it's said, that the Pressure of Fluids may be as much, in
the least part, as in the whole: therefore the Pillar C D,
and the Pillar A B, must be of equal weight, when both
are weighed together in the opposite scales of a Ballance,
which is false, seing the one is far thicker, and so heavier
then the other. There's no way to answer this objection,
but by granting the Air G H, and E F, to be equal in
<hi>Bensil,</hi> and yet the two Pillars unequal in weight, because
according to the 22 Theorem, the <hi>Bensil</hi> of a Fluid is one

               <p>FOr understanding this Theorem, we must consider, that
when two Cylinders of the same kind, as one of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with Water, or as one of Mercury with Mercury, are
counterpoising one another, both are of the same altitude,
because both are of the same natural weight. But when
the two are of different kinds, as a Cylinder of Air with
Mercury, or as a Cylinder of Air with Water, or as a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
of Water with Mercury, then it will be found, that
by what proportion, the one Liquor is naturally heavier
or lighter, then the other, by that same proportion, is the
one Cylinder higher or lower then the other. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
because Air is reckoned 14000 times lighter then
Quick-silver, therefore the Pillar of Air that counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiseth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106992:31"/>
the Pillar of Quick-silver in the <hi>Torricellian Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,</hi>
is 14000 times higher. The one is 29 inches,
and therefore the other is 406000 inches: which will
amount to 33833 foot, or about 6766 fathom, counting
five foot to a fathom. And because Air is counted 1000
times lighter then Water, therefore the Pillar of Air that
sustains the Pillar of Water is 1000 times higher. The
hight of Water by the Pressure of the Air is 34 foot,
and therefore the hight of the Air is a thousand times 34
foot. And because Water is reckoned 14 times lighter
than Mercury, therefore you will find, even by experience,
that the Pillar of Water, that counterpoises the Pillar of
Mercury, is 14 times higher. For if the Mercury be
ten inches, the Water will be exactly 140. If it be 29
inches, the Water will be thirty four foot. The reason
is evident, because if one inch of Mercury be as heavy
naturally as 14 inches of Water, it follows of necessity,
that for making of a counterpoise, to every inch of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
there must be 14 of Water, and these in altitude,
each one above another.</p>

to build such and such Theorems upon them, and to infer
such and such conclusions, as shall make a stately building,
and give a man in a short time a full view of this excellent
Doctrine.</p>
               <p>For the first Experiment then, prepare a Vessel of any
quantity, as A B C D, near half full of Water, whose
surface is M H. Prepare also two Glass-pipes, the one
wider, the other narrower, open at both ends, which must
be thrust down below the Water, first stopping the two
upper orifices E and F. This done, open the said orifices,
and you shall see the Water ascend in the wider to G, and in
the narrower to H. Now, the question is, What's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
why the Water did not ascend, the orifices E and F, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
stopped, and why it ascends, they being opened? To the
first part I answer, the Water cannot ascend, because the
imaginary surface of Water L K is equally and uniformly
prest: for with what weight the outward Water M L,
and H K press the said surface, with the same weight,
doth the Air within the two Pipes press it. To the second
part I answer, the Water ascends, because the same sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
(the orifices E and F being opened) is unequally
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106992:32"/>
prest: for the outward Water M L, and H K, press it
more, then the Air within the Pipes do. The difficulty
only is, why it is equally prest, the orifices E and F be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
stopped, and why it is unequally prest, the said orifices
being once opened. To unloose the knot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I must shew the
reason, why the Air within the Pipes, press the surface
L K, with as great a burden, as the outward Water press
it. For understanding this, you must know, that when
the orifice I is thrust down below the Water, there ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
a sort of debate between the lower parts of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the Air within the Pipes, the Water striving to
be in at I, and the Air striving to keep it out: but because
the Water is the stronger party, it enters the orifice I,
and causeth the Air retire a little up, one fourth part, or
sixth part of an inch, above I, and no more, which is a
real compression it suffers. For the orifice E being stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
hinders any more compression, than what is said; in
which instant of time the debate ends, the Air no more
yeelding, and the Water no more urging; by which means
the Air having obtained a degree of <hi>Bensil,</hi> more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
by the Pressure of that little quantity of Water,
that comes in at I, presseth the part of the imaginary sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
it rests upon, with as great weight, as the outward
Water presseth the parts it rests upon. But when the
orifice E is opened, the outward water M L, and H K,
press the imaginary surface L K more, than the Air with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Pipe can do. And the reason is, because by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the orifice above, the internal Air, that suffered a
degree of <hi>Bensil</hi> more then ordinary, presently is freed,
and consequently becomes of less force, and weight; which
the Water finding, that hath a little entered the orifice I,
instantly ascends to G, it being less pressed, then the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106992:33"/>
without the Pipe. Now the reason, why it ascends
no higher then G, is taken from the equal Pressure of the
Body that rests upon the surface M G H: For, assoon as
it comes that length, all the parts of the horizontal Plain
of Water, is uniformly prest with the incumbing Air,
both within the Pipe, and without the Pipe. The Water
in going up, cannot halt mid-way between I and G, for
then there should be an unequal Pressure in Fluids with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
motion, which is impossible; for the Water is still
stronger then the Air, till once it climb up to G.</p>
               <p>From this Experiment we see first, that in Water there
is a Pressure and Force; because having opened the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
E, which is only <hi>causa per accidens</hi> of this motion,
the Water is prest up from I to G. We see secondly,
that Fluid Bodies, can never cease from motion, till there be
an equal Pressure among the parts, which is evident from
the ascent of the Water from I to G, which cannot halt
in any part between I and G, because of an unequal Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
till it once climb up to G. We see thirdly, that
Fluid Bodies do not sustain, or counterpoise one another
according to their <hi>thickness</hi> and <hi>breadth,</hi> but only accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their <hi>altitude;</hi> because there is not here any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
between the slender Pillar of Water H K within
the Pipe, and the outward Water that sustains it, I
mean as to the <hi>thickness;</hi> therefore 'tis no matter, whither
the Glass Tubs be wider or narrower, that are used in
counterpoising Fluid bodies one with another. And this
is the true reason, why 'tis no matter, whither the Tub of
the <hi>Baroscope</hi> be a wide one, or a narrow one, seing the Air
doth not counterpoise the Mercury, according to <hi>thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
that's to say, neither the thickness of the ambient
Air that sustains, nor the thickness of the Mercury that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106992:33"/>
is sustained, are to be considered; but only their <hi>altitudes.</hi>
'Tis true, the element of Air is fourteen thousand times
higher, then the Mercurial Cylinder, yet there is a
certain and true proportion kept between their heights;
so that if the element of Air, should by <hi>divine providence</hi>
become higher or lower, the height of the Mercury would
alter accordingly.</p>

               <p>TAke out of the Water, the wide Pipe E G I, and
stopping the orifice I, pour in Water above at E,
till the Tub be compleatly full. Having done this, thrust
down the stopped orifice I to the bottom of the Vessel,
and there open it, then shall you see the Water fall down
from E to G, and there halt. The reason is taken from
unequal Pressure; for the Tub being full of Water from
E to I, that part of the <hi>imaginary</hi> surface, upon which
the Pillar of Water rests, is more burdened than any other
part of it, namely more then L or K; therefore seing
one part is more burdened than another, the Cylinder of
Water that causeth the burden, must so far fall down, till
all the parts be alike prest, in which instant of time, the
motion ceaseth. This leads us to a clear discovery of the
reason, why in the <hi>Baroscope,</hi> the Mercury falls from the
top of the Tub of any height, alwayes to the twentieth and
ninth inch, above the stagnant Quick-silver. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
fill the Pipe N Q, which is sixty inches high
with Mercury, and opening the orifice Q, the Liquor
shall fall out, and fall down from N, till it rest at R, which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106992:34"/>
is twenty nine inch above the open orifice Q. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is the same, namely unequal Pressure, seing one part
of the <hi>imaginary</hi> surface of Air X S, upon which the
Cylinder of Mercury stands, is more burthened then the
other next adjacent: therefore, so long and so far must the
Mercury subside and fall down, till the part Q, upon
which the Basis of the Pillar rests, be no more burthened,
than the rest of the parts; in which instant of time, the
motion ceaseth, and there happeneth an equal ballance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Silver within the Tub, and the Air without.
If it be said, I see a clear reason, why the outward Water
M L, ought to sustain the inward G I, but cannot see,
why the outward Air T Z S and V R X, ought to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
the inward Mercury R X: neither do I see a reason,
why it should halt at R, as the Water rests at G. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
though sense cannot perceive the one, as evidently
as the other, yet the one is as sure as the other. For tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the reason why it halts at R, 29 inches above X,
you must remember, from the 25 Theorem, that the
Pressure of the Air upon Bodies, is equivalent to the
weight of 34 foot of VVater perpendicularly, or 29 inches
of <hi>Quick-silver.</hi> The Pillars of Air then T Z S, and
V R X, being as heavy each one of them, as two Pillars
of Mercury, each one of them 29 inches high, it follows
of necessity, that the Mercury within the Tub, must be
as high as R. 'Tis no wonder to see the <hi>Silver</hi> halt at R,
provided R X, and Z S, were two bulks of Mercury, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironing
the Pipe, as the outward VVater environs the
wider and narrower Pipe. Neither ought any to wonder,
when the <hi>Silver</hi> falls down, and rests at R, nothing envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roning
the Pipe but Air, seing the Pressure of the Air is
equivalent to the weight of 29 inches of <hi>Quick-silver.</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:106992:34"/>
This Experiment is easily made: take therefore a slender
Glass-pipe of any length, beyond 30 inches, open at both
ends; but the lower and Q, must be drawn so small by a
flame of a Lamp, that the entry may be no wider, than may
admit the point of a small needle, or the hair of ones head.
Then stopping the said orifice, pour in Mercury above at
the orifice N, till the Pipe be compleatly full. Next,
close the said orifice with wet Paper, and the pulp of your
finger; and opening the lower orifice, you shall find,
(which is very delightful to behold) the Mercury spring
out, like unto a small silver threed, and falling down from
the top N, shall rest at R, the motion ceasing at the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
orifice Q. This shews evidently, that there is not
need alwayes of stagnant Mercury, for trying the <hi>Torrieel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
Experiment;</hi> but only when the mouth of the Pipe
below is wide: for being narrow, the <hi>silver</hi> runs slowly
out, and consequently subsides slowly above, and coming
down slowly to R, there rests. But when the mouth is
wide below, the <hi>silver</hi> falls down so quickly, that it goes
beyond R, before it can recover it self, which recovery
would never be, unless there were stagnant Mercury to
run up again.</p>
               <p>From what is said, we see first, that when one part of a
surface of Water or Air, is more burthened than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the burthened part presently yeelds, till it be no more
burthened than the other. This is clear from the falling
down of the Water from E to G, which cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by the part I, because more burthened than the
rest. We see secondly, that the element of Air, rests up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the surfaces of all bodies with a considerable weight;
otherwise it could not sustain the Water, before it fall
down from E to G: for if it did not left upon the surface
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106992:35"/>
M H, with weight, the Water could never be suspended;
seing the application of the finger to the orifice E, is
only the <hi>accidental cause</hi> of this sustentation. We see
thirdly, that according to the difference of <hi>natural weight,</hi>
between two Fluids, so is the proportion of <hi>altitudes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two of their Cylinders: therefore Air being reckoned
14000 times lighter then Mercury, it followes that the
Cylinder of Mercury sustained by the Air, must be 14000
times lower and shorter, than the Cylinder of Air that
sustaines it; which appears from this experiment to be true,
seeing by the Pressure of the Air, which is thought to be
about 7000 fathom high, 29 inches of Mercury is support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
between R and X. In a word, if Air be naturally
14000 times lighter than Mercury, which is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable;
then must the altitude of it, commonly called the
<hi>Atmosphere,</hi> be fourteen thousand times, nine and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
inches, that is 406000, or of feet 33833.</p>

               <p>WHile the outward, and inward Water are of the
same altitude, withdraw the inward Air E G by
suction, or by any other device you think fit, and you will
find the Water rise as high as E, which I suppose to be
34 foot above M G H. The same <hi>Phenomenon</hi> happens,
in taking the Air out of the narrow Pipe F K. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is still unequal Pressure; for in removing the Air,
that's within the Pipe, the part of the surface M, and the
part H, remaines burthened, while the part G is freed
of its burden: therefore this part of the surface, being libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106992:35"/>
of its burden, that came down through the Pipe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
rises, and climbs up as far, as the outward Air rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon M and H, can raise it, which is to E 34 foot:
for the Pressure of the Air upon the surfaces of all Waters,
according to the 25 <hi>Theorem,</hi> being equivalent to the
weight of 34 foot of Water, must raise the said Water in
the Pipe 34 foot. You do not wonder, why it rises from I to
G, as in the first experiment; no more ought you to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
why it rises from G to E, seing the weight of the
Air, doth the same thing, that 34 foot of Water resting
upon the surface M H, would do.</p>
               <p>From this experiment we see first, that the Pressure of the
Air, is the proper cause of the motion of Water, up tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<hi>Pumps</hi> and <hi>Siphons,</hi> or any other instrument, that's
used in Water-works of that kind; for if the weight of the
Air, resting upon the surface M H be the cause, why
the Water climbs up from G to E, the same must be
the cause, why the stagnant Water followes the <hi>Sucker</hi> of
the <hi>Pump,</hi> while it's pulled up. And the same is the cause,
why Water ascends the Leg of a <hi>Siphon,</hi> and is the cause,
why motion continues after suction is ended. We see se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that every Pressing Fluid hath a <hi>Sphere of activity,</hi>
to which it is able to raise the Fluid, that is pressed. This
is evident in this experiment, because the Pressure of the
Air resting upon M H, is able to raise the Water, the
hight of E in the wide Pipe, and the hight of F in the
narrow, and no further, even though the said Pipes were
far longer: and this altitude and highest point is precisely
34 foot between Air and Water. We see thirdly, that
'tis all one matter, whether <hi>Pumps</hi> and <hi>Siphons</hi> be wider or
narrower, whether the tub of the <hi>Baroscope</hi> be, wherein the
Mercury is suspended, of a large Diameter, or of a lesser
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106992:36"/>
Diameter. This is also evident from the same experiment;
seing there is no more difficulty in causing the Water as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
the wide Pipe, than in causing it ascend the narrow
one. And the reason is, because the pressing Fluid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
not the pressed Fluid, according to its <hi>thickness</hi> and
<hi>breadth;</hi> but only according to its <hi>altitude.</hi> Therefore' its
as easie for the Air, to press up Water through a <hi>Pump</hi> four

Figure 7.</head>
               <p>THis Schematism represents a large Vessel full of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whose first and visible surface is D E H K. The
second, that's imaginary is, L I, six foot below it. The
third of the same kind, is M G, six foot lower. The
fourth, is N F O, six foot yet lower. The last, and
lowest, is A B C. There are here also four Tubs, or rather
one Tub under four divers positions, with both ends open.
After this Tub D A is thrust below the Water, till it as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend,
as high as D in it, lift it up between your fingers,
till it have the position of the second Pipe E F, and then
you shall see, as the orifice of the Pipe ascends, the Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Water fall out by little and little, until it be no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than E F. Again, lift it further up, till it have the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the Pipe H G, then shall you find the Cylinder
of Water become yet shorter. Lastly, if it be scituated,
as the Pipe K I the internal Water becomes no longer than
K I. The reasons of these <hi>Phenomena</hi> are the same; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unequal Pressure; for the Orifice A being lifted up as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106992:36"/>
high as F, it comes to the imaginary surface N O, which
is not under so much Pressure, as the other is; therefore
one part of it being more burdened, than another, namely
the part upon which the Cylinder of Water rests, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
yeelds, and suffers the Cylinder to become shorter,
and lighter, till it become no heavier, then is proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to its own strength. To make this reason more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
it is to be noted, that no surface of Water is able to
support a Cylinder higher then its own deepness, that is to
say, if a surface be 40 foot deep, it is able to sustain a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
40 foot high, and no more: therefore the surface
N O, being but 18 foot deep, it cannot sustain a Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
24 foot long: for if that were, then the <hi>Potentia,</hi>
should be inferiour to the <hi>Pondus,</hi> which is impossible in
the <hi>Hydrostaticks.</hi> In effect, it were no less absurdity,
then to say, 18 ounces are able to counterballance 24. For
a second trial, lift up the same Pipe higher, till it acquire
the position of the Tub G H; in this case, the Cylinder
of Water within it, becomes yet shorter, even no longer,
than G H. The reason is the same, namely unequal Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
for when a Cylinder of Water 18 foot high, comes
to rest upon this surface, that is but 12 foot deep, it makes
one part of it more burdened then another; therefore the
part that is more prest, presently yeelds, and suffers the
Cylinder to fall down, till the <hi>Pondus</hi> of it, become equal
to its own <hi>Potentia.</hi> For the last trial, lift up the Tub,
till it acquire the position of the Pipe K I: in this case, the
Water within it becomes no longer then K I, the surface
L I, that is but six foot deep, not being able to sustain a
Cylinder 12 foot high.</p>
               <p>From this Experiment we see first, that in all Fluid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
there is a Pressure, which is more or less, according to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106992:37"/>
the deepness of that Fluid; this is evident from the four
several surfaces; there being more Pressure and force in the
lowest A B C, then in the next N O; and more in this,
then in the surface M G; and more in this, then in L I.
We see secondly, that in all Fluids, there is a <hi>Pondus</hi> and
a <hi>Potentia;</hi> which two are alwayes of equal force, and
strength; the <hi>Potentia</hi> is clear and evident in the surface,
by supporting the Pillar; which Pillar is nothing else, but
the <hi>Pondus</hi> supported. And that they are alwayes of equal
strength, is most evident also; for when you endeavour
to make the <hi>Pondus</hi> unequal to the <hi>Potentia,</hi> in making a
surface 18 foot deep, to support a Pillar 24 foot high, they
of their own accord become equal; the Pillar becoming
shorter, and suitable to the strength of the surface that
sustains it. We see thirdly, that 'tis impossible for one
part of the same Horizontal surface, to be more burdened
then another: for when you endeavour to do it, by setting
a longer Pillar upon it, the part burdened instantly yeelds,
till it be no more prest, then the next part to it. We see
fourthly, that the inequality, that is between the <hi>Pondus</hi>
and the <hi>Potentia</hi> in Fluids, is the proper cause of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Fluids. For when you endeavour to make a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
30 foot deep, sustain a Pillar 40 foot high, this inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is the true cause, why the Pillar subsides, and falls
down, and why the surface yeelds, and gives way to it.
And this inequality is the true cause, why the motion of
Water thorow <hi>Siphons</hi> continues. For understanding this,
you must conceive a <hi>Siphon,</hi> to be nothing else, but a crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Pipe with two legs, the one drowned among Water,
the other hanging in the open Air. The use of it is, for
conveying Wine or Water from one Vessel to another,
which is easily done by suction. Now after suction is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106992:37"/>
the motion of the Water continues, till the surface
become lower, then the orifice out of which it runs. The
true reason then, why the Water flows out, is the inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
between the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the Air, and the <hi>Pondus</hi> of the
VVater; the <hi>Pondus</hi> being stronger then the <hi>Potentia.</hi>
For in Air as in VVater, we must conceive Horizontal
surfaces; and these surfaces to be endowed with Pressure
and force, as are the surfaces of VVater. Now when the
leg of a <hi>Siphon</hi> is hanging in the Air, it must rest upon one
surface or another, and consequently the VVater in it,
must rest upon the same surface. If the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the
surface be stronger, then the <hi>Pondus</hi> of the VVater; the
VVater is driven backward, which alwayes comes to pass,
when the orifice is higher, then the surface of the VVater
of the Vessel, among which the other leg is drowned. If
the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the surface of that Air, be of equal power
and strength, with the <hi>Pondus</hi> of the VVater, the VVater
goeth neither backward, nor forward, but stands in <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librio:</hi>
this happens, when the orifice is neither higher, nor
lower, than the surface of the VVater in the Vessel. But
if the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the surface of the Air be weaker, than the
<hi>Pondus</hi> of the VVater; in this case, the Air yeelds, and
suffers the VVater to run out, even as a surface 30 foot
deep, yeelds to a Pillar of VVater 40 foot high. The same
inequality is the reason, why VVater climbs up the Pump;
why VVater climbs up a Pipe, when a man sucks with his
mouth. Before suction, the <hi>Potentia</hi> that's in the surface
of VVater, among which the end of the Pipe is drowned,
is of equal force with the <hi>Pondus</hi> of the Pillar of Air, that
comes down thorow the Pipe, or Pump; but assoon as a
man begins to suck, the said Pillar of Air becomes lighter;
and the VVater finding this, presently ascends. The same
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106992:38"/>
is the reason, why the Mercury falls down to 29 inches in
the <hi>Baroscope,</hi> and no further: for as long as the <hi>Pondus</hi> of
the Pillar of Mercury, exceeds the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the surface of
Air, so long doth the motion continue; and when both
are become equal in force, the motion ceaseth. VVhen the
Glass-tub is 40 inches long, and filled with Mercury, and
inverted after the common manner, you are endeavouring
as it were, to cause a surface 29 inches deep, sustain a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
40 inches high, which is utterly impossible in Fluids<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
It is judged by many a wonder to see the deflux of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
in the <hi>Baroscope;</hi> but in effect, there's no more cause
of admiration in it, than to see the Cylinder of Water
grow shorter, by lifting the Pipe up from one surface to
another.</p>
               <p>From this Experiment, we see the true reason, why the
Mercurial Cylinder of the <hi>Baroscope</hi> becomes shorter and
shorter, according as a man climbs up a mountain with it.
For at the root of the hill, the surface of Air, that sustains
the Pillar of Mercury, is of greater force, than the surface
at the middle part: and this is stronger than any surface at
the top. The Pipe therefore being carried up from one
surface to another, the Mercury in it, must subside, and
fall down, even as the Water falls down, and becomes
shorter, by lifting the Pipe from the surface A B C D to
the surface N O. And as the whole VVater would fall
down, if the orifice I, were lifted above the surface D E H K,
so if the <hi>Baroscope</hi> could be carried so high, till it came
above the top of the Air, the whole Mercurial Cylinder
would surely fall down. And as by thrusting down the
said Pipe to the bottom of the Vessel again, as the Pipe
D A, the VVater ascends in it; so by bringing down the
<hi>Baroscope</hi> to the earth again, the whole 19 inches would
rise again.</p>

               <p>FIll the Vessel A D G H with VVater to the brim.
Next, thrust down the open orifice of the Tub D A,
to the bottom, and you shall see the VVater ascend in
it, as high as D, according to the first experiment. When
this is done, recline the said Pipe, till it ly as B E, and you
shall find the Pipe, compleatly full of VVater. Next, erect
the same Tub again as D A, and you shall see the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
of VVater fall down, and become shorter, as at first.
For salving this <hi>Phenomenon,</hi> and such like, I must suppose
this VVater to be 50 inches deep, and the Tub I A, and B E
90 inches long: and the said Tub in reclining, to describe
the quadrant of a Circle F E G. Now the question is, why
there being but 50 inches of Water in the Tub, while erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
there should be 60 in it, when it is reclined? Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
why there should be 90 inches of Water in the Tub B E,
and but 50 in it, when it stands Perpendicular, as D A?
If you reply, because there are 90 inches <hi>in recta linea</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the point B, and the point E, and but 50 between
A and D. But this will not answer the case; because,
if you stop the orifice E, with the pulp of your Finger,
before it be erected, you will find the Tub remain full of
VVater, even while it stands Perpendicular; and fall down,
when the orifice is opened. Or, while the Tub stands
Perpendicular, stop the orifice I, and recline it as B E:
yet no more Water will be found in it, than 50 inches: but
by unstopping the said orifice, the VVater climbs up from
R to E, and becomes 90 inches. Now, what's the reason,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106992:39"/>
why it runs up from R to E, and why it falls down from
I to D? I answer then, the VVater must run<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>up from R
to E, because of the inequality, that's between the <hi>Pondus</hi>
of the Cylinder B R, and the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the surface of
VVater A B C, that supports the said Cylinder. For
understanding this, know, while the Tub is erected, there
is a perfect equality, between the weight of the Pillar A
D, and the force or <hi>Power</hi> of the surface that sustains it, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a surface 50 inches deep, supports a Pillar 50 inches
high. But assoon as the Tub is reclined, there arises ane
inequality between the saids two parties, the <hi>Pondus</hi> of
the Cylinder becoming now less than before. If you say
the quantity of the VVater is the same, namely 50 inches,
in the reclined Tub, as well as in the Perpendicular. I
grant the quantity is the same, but the weight is become
less. Now the reason, why the same individual VVater, is
not so heavy as before, is this; there are 40 ounces of
it, supported by the sides of the Tub within; which
were not, while the Tub was erected: for in this positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the whole weight of the Cylinder rests upon the surface:
but while the Tub is reclined, the said surface is eased, and
freed of 40 ounces of it; this 40, resting and leaning upon
the sides of the Pipe within. The surface then, finding
the said Cylinder lighter now than before, instantly drives
it up from R to E, 40 inches. And likewise, when the
reclined Pipe is made Perpendicular, the Water falls down
from I to D, because of the inequality, that's between
the <hi>Pondus</hi> of the Pillar, and the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the surface;
this surface 50 inches deep, not being able to support a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
90 inches high; for if this were, then one part, should
be more burthened than another, which is impossible.</p>
               <p>It is to be observed, that by how much the more, the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106992:39"/>
Tub is reclined from a Perpendicular, towards the horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
surface A B C, by so much the more growes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality,
between the <hi>Pondus</hi> and the <hi>Potentia,</hi> and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to a certaine proportion. Hence is it, that the
Tub being reclined from 60 degrees to 50, there arises a
greater inequality between the <hi>Pondus</hi> of the Cylinder, and
the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the surface, than while it is reclined from 70
to 60: and more yet in moving from 50 to 40, than in
moving from 60 to 50, and so downward, till it be horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
in which position, the whole <hi>Pondus</hi> is lost. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise,
while the Pipe is elevated, the <hi>Pondus</hi> begins to
grow; and growes more, being lifted up from 10 to 20,
than from 1 to 10: and yet more in travelling from 20 to
30, than from 10 to 20, and so upwards; till it be Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular,
in which position, the Cylinder regaines the whole
<hi>Pondus</hi> and weight, it had. This proportion is easily
known, for its nothing else, but the proportion of <hi>Versed
Sines</hi> upon the line F B; for according to what measure,
these unequal divisions become wider, and wider from 90
to 1, according to the same proportion does the <hi>Pondus</hi> of
the Cylinder become less and less: and contrariwise, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to what proportion the said divisions become more and
more narrow from 1 to 90, according to the same measure
and rate, does the <hi>Pondus</hi> of the Cylinder become greater
and greater.</p>
               <p>From this experiment we see first, that two Cylinders
of Fluid bodies, differing much in quantity, may be of the
same weight: because though the Cylinder B E 90 inches
long, be far more in quantity, than the Cylinder D A,
that's but 50, yet both of them are of the same weight, in
respect of the surface that sustaines them. If it be said, the
one is really heavier, than the other, notwithstanding of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106992:40"/>
all this. I answer, it is so indeed, in respect of the <hi>Libra,</hi> or
Artificial Ballance, that we commonly use in weighing of
things: but it is not so in respect of this <hi>Natural Ballance,</hi> if
I may so speak, wherein Fluid bodies are onely weighed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner. We see secondly a clear ground for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
down the ninth Theorem, namely, that in all Fluid
bodies a twofold weight may be distinguished, one <hi>Sensible,</hi>
another <hi>Insensible:</hi> because the <hi>Sensible</hi> weight of the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
of Water B E, remaines still the same, even though
it should be reclined to G; for take it out, and weigh it
in a Ballance, it will be as heavy the one way as the other.
But it is not so with the <hi>Insensible</hi> weight; seeing the Tub
begins no sooner to recline, but assoon it begins to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
and grows less. This <hi>Insensible</hi> weight is nothing
else, but the <hi>sensible</hi> weight considered after another manner.
For look upon the weight of the Pillar of Water B E, as
it weighs in a pair of Scales, it is then <hi>Sensible,</hi> and weighs so
many ounces, and cannot be more or less: but look upon
it in reference to the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the surface, that sustains it,
it is then <hi>Insensible</hi> as to us: for though a man should put
his hand below the Water, and endeavour to find the
weight of the said Pillar, yet he shall not find it, though
that part of the surface upon which it rests, doth really
(if I may so speak) find the weight of it. And as it is
<hi>Insensible,</hi> so is it sometimes more, and sometimes less,
according as the Tub is elevated, or reclined: now these
two being put together, gives a very probable ground for
this distinction. We see thirdly, that the <hi>Pondus</hi> or weight
of Fluids, doth not only press according to Perpendicular
lines, but according to lines falling obliquely upon the
imaginary surface; so doth the weight of the Pillar of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
B E, press the surface A B C. We see fourthly, that

                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:106992:42"/>
Fluid Bodies, do counterpoise one another, according
to <hi>Altitude</hi> only: for put the case, the Pipe B E, we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e ten
times wider then it is, yet will the surface sustain the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in it, provided the Pipe keep still the same position of
<hi>Altitude,</hi> namely 50 degrees: the reason seems to be this;
for if the <hi>Base</hi> of the Pillar become more in Diameter, it
necessarily requires a larger part of the surface to rest upon;
which larger part is really stronger than the lesser part, as
will be shewed afterwards. From this Experiment we see
lastly, an evident reason, why the Mercurial Cylinder in
the <hi>Baroscope</hi> runs up, and fills the empty space, when the
Pipe is reclined, and why it runs down, when the Tub is
erected again. In effect, the reason is the same, namely, an
inequality between the <hi>Pondus</hi> of the Quick-silver, and the
<hi>Potentia</hi> of the surface of the Air: for when the Tub be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to recline, the <hi>Pondus</hi> begins to rest upon the side of
the Tub within; by which means the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
finding the burden less, instantly thrusts up the stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Mercury to supply that loss, seing two Fluids cannot
counterpoise one another, unless they be in <hi>aequilibrio.</hi>
And contrariwise, assoon as the Tub begins to be erected,
the <hi>Pondus</hi> of the Mercury begins to grow, and so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the surface, till by falling down it
can do no more.</p>

the VVater O I is suspended by the weight of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbing
Air, resting upon the surface H I K. For under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this, consider, as I said before, 25. Theorem,
that the Pressure of the Air upon all Bodies, is just equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to the weight of 34 foot of VVater. Hence then
is it, that if the Air be able to sustain a Pillar of VVater,
34 foot high, it must be able to sustain the short Pillar O I,
that exceeds not four foot. The second question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the part F, be equally burthened with the part E, or
G; for it would seem not, seing the VVater O I F, is
but four foot high; whilest upon E or G is resting, not
only more then a foot of VVater to the top H I K, but
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106992:43"/>
the whole weight of the <hi>Atmosphere</hi> upon the said top
is resting, which is equivalent to the burden of 34 foot of
VVater. I answer, there's more to be considered, than
that four foot of VVater, which in it self is but of small
burden, therefore to this we must add the weight of the
Air between O and S, within the Pipe (remember that
the orifice S is stopped with the pulp of the Finger) which
in effect will be as heavy as 31 foot of VVater. Put the
case then, F, to be one foot below the first surface H I K,
and the VVater O I to be three foot, then ought the
Air O S, to have the weight of 31 foot, because the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
E F G is able to support a Pillar of 35 foot. This
I prove, because the part E, <hi>de facto,</hi> sustains 35 foot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Air above is equivalent to 34 foot of it, and
there is a foot of VVater between it and the top, namely
between E and H. The third question is, how it comes
to pass, that the Water still remains in the Pipe, after the
orifice M is brought above the surface of the Water; for
there is here no stagnant Water guarding it, as guards the
orifice F. I answer, that the <hi>base</hi> M, of this Pillar of
Water P M, as really rests upon the horizontal surface of
this Air L M N, as a Cylinder of Brass or Timber rests
upon a plain Marble Table, and after the same manner.
Remember that the orifice T is stopped all this time, with
the pulp of the Finger. If it be said, that the part M, is
more burdened then the part N, seing it sustains four foot
of Water, which the part N supports not, and the Air
P T within the Pipe also, which is of as much <hi>Bensil</hi> and
Pressure, as the Air N Y is of. For clearing of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
consider, that the Pillar P M is shorter now than
before; for the orifice M coming up from D, some inches
of Water falls out, as will be found by experience. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106992:44"/>
then, that of four foot, six inches fall out; if this
be, then the inclosed Air between P and T, must be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
inches longer, if this be, then of necessity the Bensil of it
must be proportionably remitted and slackened: whence
follows by <hi>Metaphysical</hi> necessity, that it cannot burden the
Water P M, with as much weight as it had, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the surface of Air cannot be so much burdened.
It must then be no more bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dened with them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than it is with the single Pillar of Air Y N. If then
the Water P M, be three foot and an half, the weight
of the enclosed Air T P, must be exactly the weight of
thirty foot of Water and an half.</p>
               <p>From this experiment, we see first the Pressure of the
Air, for by it the Water O I is suspended, and by the
same pressure is the Water P M suspended. We see se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that in Air, there is a power of dilating it self, and
that this dilatation never happens, without a relaxation of
the <hi>Bensil.</hi> We see thirdly, that one Fluid cannot sustain
another, unless the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the one, be equal to the
<hi>Pondus</hi> of the other, as is clear from the Aërial surface, that
cannot sustain the whole four foot of Water, but suffers
six inches of it to fall out, that the <hi>Pondus</hi> of the rest, and
the Air above it, may become equal to its own <hi>Potentia.</hi>
We see fourthly, that Fluid Bodies have not only a power
of pressing downward, but of pressing upward likewise:
as is clear from the Water O I, that's suspended by the
Air pressing down the surface of Water H I K. It pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
upward also, while it supports the Water P M. This
Experiment also answers a case, namely, whether or not, it
is alwayes needful to guard the orifice of the Tub of the
<hi>Baroscope</hi> with stagnant Quick-silver? I say then, it is not
alwayes needful, provided the orifice be of a narrow
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106992:44"/>
diameter; for experience tells, that while it is such, the
Mercury will subside, and halt at 29 inches above the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
though no stagnant Mercury be to guard. In making
this trial, the orifice must be no wider, than may admit
the point of a needle. Or suppose it to have the wideness
of a <hi>Tobacco-pipe,</hi> yet will the Mercury be suspended,
though the end be not drowned among stagnant <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver,</hi>
even as the Water P M, is kept up without stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Water about it. For trial of this, you must first let
the end of the Pipe, be put down among stagnant Mercury,
and after the Cylinder is fallen down to its own proper alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
lift up the Pipe slowly, till the orifice come above
the surface, and you will find, provided you do not shake
the Pipe, the Cylinder to be suspended after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
immediatly by the Air, as the Water P M is.</p>

            <div n="7" type="experiment">
               <head>EXPERIMENT VII.
Figure 10, 11.</head>
               <p>TAke a Vessel of any quantity, such as A B C D E,
and fill it with VVater. And a Glass-pipe, such as
G F D, of 15 or 20 inches long, of any wideness, closs
above, and open below. Before you drown the open end
among the VVater, hold the Glass before the fire, till it
be pretty hot, and having put it down, you will see the
VVater begin to creep up till it come to F, where it halts.
The question now is, what's the reason, why the VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
creeps up after this manner, 10 or 12 inches above the
surface A B? I answer, the heat having rarified the Air
within, and by this means, having expelled much of it,
and the Air now contracting it self again with cold, the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106992:45"/>
VVater ascends, being prest up with the weight of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbing
Air, resting upon the surface of Water A B.
There is here surely an inequality between a <hi>Pondus</hi> and a
<hi>Potentia,</hi> that must be the cause of this motion. I judge then
the inequality to consist between the weight of the Air
within the Pipe, and the surface of Water C D E. To expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
this, I must suppose the Pipe to be thrust down cold;
in this case, little or no Water can enter the orifice D. And
the reason is, because the <hi>Pondus</hi> of the Air within the
Glass, is equal to the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the surface C D E. But
when the Pipe is thrust down hot, much of the Air having
been expelled by the heat, and now beginning to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
by cold, the <hi>Pondus</hi> of the Air becomes unequal to
the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the surface, and therefore this, being the
stronger party, drives up the Air within the Glass, till by
this ascent, the <hi>Pondus</hi> of the Air G F, and the <hi>Pondus</hi>
of the Water F D together, become equal to the <hi>Potentia</hi>
of the surface C D E, that sustains them. For a second
trial; bring a hot coal near to the side of the Glass, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
G and F, and you will find the Water to creep down
from F toward the surface A B; and if it continue any
space, it will drive down the whole Water, and thrust it
out at D. To explicate this, I must suppose that heat,
by rarifying the Air within the Glass, intends and increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the <hi>Bensil</hi> of it, and the <hi>Bensil</hi> being now made strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
there must arise an inequality between the <hi>Pondus</hi> of
the said Air, and the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the surface C D E; the
Air then, being the stronger party, causeth the surface to
yeeld.</p>
               <p>By comparing this Experiment with the former, we see
a great difference between the dilatation of Air, of its own
accord, and by constraint. For while it is willingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106992:45"/>
the <hi>Bensil</hi> begins to grow slack, and remiss, and
loseth by degrees of its strength; even as the <hi>Spring</hi> of a
<hi>Watch</hi> by the motion of the Wheels, becomes remiss. But
when the dilatation is made by heat, and the Air compelled
to expand and open it self, the <hi>Bensil</hi> becomes the stronger,
and the Pressure the greater. Notwithstanding, though
the <hi>Bensil</hi> of this inclosed Air G F, may be made stronger
by heat, to the expulsion of the Water F D, yet if this
rarefact on continue any time, the <hi>Bensil</hi> becomes dull and
slack. And the reason is, because Air cannot be expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and opened to any quantity; an inch cannot be dilated
and opened to an hundred, or to a thousand: neither can
the <hi>Bensil</hi> of it be intended, and increase to any degree, <hi>v. g.</hi>
from one to 20, 30, or 100. And therefore, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansion
grows, the <hi>Bensil</hi> must at length slacken. But if
so be the Air were inclosed, as in a bladder knit about the
neck with a string, then the more heat, the more <hi>Bensil:</hi>
for in this case there is a growth of Pressure, without dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
And sometimes the <hi>Bensil</hi> may be so intended with
the heat, that the sides of the bladder will burst asunder.</p>
               <p>From this Experiment we see first a confirmation of the
21 Theorem, namely, that there may be as much <hi>Bensil</hi>
and Pressure, in the smallest quantity of a Fluid, as in the
greatest; as is clear from the <hi>Bensil</hi> of the Air G F, which
in effect counterpoiseth the weight of the whole <hi>Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere,</hi>
resting upon the surface of Water A B. We see
secondly, that when the <hi>pondus,</hi> and the <hi>potentia</hi> of two
Fluids, are in <hi>equilibrio,</hi> or of equal strength, a very small
addition to either of them, will cast the ballance. For if a
man should but breath softly upon the side of the Glass be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
G and F, or lay his warm hand to it, the said Air
will presently dilate it self, and by becoming thus stronger,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106992:46"/>
thrust down the Water, and so overcome the <hi>potentia</hi> of
the surface. We see thirdly a confirmation of the sixth
Theorem, namely, that the Pressure of Fluids is on every
side; as is clear from the inclosed Air G F, that not only
presseth down the Water F D, but with as great force
presseth up the top of the Glass within, and presseth upon
all the sides of it within, with the same force. This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
also, leads us to the knowledge of two things:
First, of the reason, why with cold the Water ascends in
the common <hi>Weather-glasses;</hi> and why in hot weather
the Water descends. Secondly, from this Experiment
we may learn to know, when the Air is under a greater
Pressure, and when under a lesser: because when the Air
becomes heavier, as in fair weather, the Water creeps
up in some measure, it may be two or three inches; when
there is no alteration as to heat and cold: and in foul wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or in great winds, when the Air is really lighter, the
said Water creeps down as much. If it be asked, how shall
I know, whether it be the cold of the Air, or heaviness
of the Air, that causeth the Water to ascend; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be the heat of the Air, or the lightness of the Air,
that causeth the Water to descend? I have proposed this
question of purpose, to let you see a mistake. Many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the ascent and descent of Water in common
<hi>Weather-glasses,</hi> is allanerly from the heat and coldness of
the Air; and therefore they conclude a cold day to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Water is far up: whereas the Water hath ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
since the last night, by reason of a greater weight in
the Air, which alwayes is, when the weather is dry, and
calm, though there hath been no alteration of heat to cold.
If it be asked, how come we to the knowledge of this, that
the pressure and weight of the Element of Air, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106992:46"/>
less, and sometimes more? I answer, this secret o
Nature, was never discovered, till the invention of the
<hi>Torricellian Experiment,</hi> otherwise called the <hi>Baroscope.</hi>
For after the falling down of the <hi>Quick-silver</hi> to 29
inches: if you suffer it to stand thus in your Parlour or
Chamber, according as the Pressure, and weight of the
Element of Air, becomes more or less, so will the Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the Mercury become less or more, and vary some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
above 29 inches, and sometimes below. This alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is very sensible, which is sometimes the tenth part
of an inch, sometimes the sixth, and sometimes the third,
according as the weight of the Air is less or more. From
<hi>December</hi> to <hi>February,</hi> I found the alteration become
less and more from 30 inches to 28, which will be three
fingers breadth. The common <hi>Weather-glasses</hi> then are
fallacious, and deceitful, unless they be so contrived, that
the Pressure of the Air cannot affect them, which is easily
done by sealing them <hi>Hermetically,</hi> and in stead of common
Water, to put in <hi>Spiritus Vini rectificatissimus,</hi> or the most
excellent Spirit of Wine, and strongest that can be made.</p>
               <p>It may be here inquired, whether or not, Mercury would
ascend in this Glass, as the Water does? I answer it would;
because the ascent depends only upon the Pressure of the
Air, incumbing upon the stagnant Liquor in the Vessell,
that's able to drive up Mercury as well as Water. It may
be inquired secondly, how far Mercury will ascend, and
how far Water will creep up? I answer, Mercury can as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
no higher in a Tub, than 29 inches; and Water no
higher, than 34 foot; and this onely happens, when there
is no Air above the tops of the Cylinders to hinder their
ascents. But when there is Air, as G F above the liquor,
it can go no higher, than the point to which the cold is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106992:47"/>
able to contract the inclosed Air, which is in this Glass, the
point F. It may be inquired thirdly, which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
difficulty, whether or not Mercury, will rise as easily in
a Tub as Water; for seeing, its 14 times heavier, it seemes
the Air should have greater difficulty to press it up, than
to press up Water? I answer, 'tis greater difficulty for the
Air to press up 20 inches of Mercury, than to press up 20
inches of Water; yet its no greater difficulty, for the Air
to press up 20 inches of Mercury, than to press up 23 foot
of Water, because the burden and weight is the same. It
may be inquired fourthly, whether or not, it be as easie for
the Air, to press up a thick and gross Cylinder of Water,
as to press up a thin and slender one? For example, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it as easie for the Air to press up a Cylinder of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
10 inches in Diameter, and 10 foot high, as it is to press
up one, two inches in diameter, and 10 foot high? I answer,
there is no more difficulty in the one, than in the other:
and the reason is, because Fluid bodies do not counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poise
one another according to their <hi>thickness,</hi> but only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their <hi>altitude,</hi> according to the fourth Theorem.
Therefore seeing the slender Cylinder is as high as the
grosser, it must be no more difficult to the Air, to press up
the one then the other.</p>
               <p>There is one difficulty yet remaining, which is truely
the greatest of all; namely what's the reason, why its
more difficult to the Air, to press up 20 inches of Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
than to press up 20 inches of Water: or more difficult
to the Air, to press up 20 inches of Mercury, than to press
up 10? I answer, this comes to pass, because the Air is
more burthened with 20 inches of Mercury, than with 10.
Now, if this be, then surely it must be more hard to the
Air, to do the one, than to do the other: even as it is more
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106992:47"/>
hard; for a man, to lift up from the ground, 20 pound of
iron, than to lift up 10 or 15. The case may be better il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated
after this manner. Suppose a man standing on the
ground, with a rope in his hand, coming down from a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
above, drawing up a weight to the top of the house:
put the case likewise, the weight be a stone of 20 pound,
and the weight of it, to increase successively, as it is pulled
up. Now its easie for the man to pull up the stone the
first fathom; because it is but 20 pound weight: but the
stone becoming 40 pound in the second fathom, and 60
in the third, and 80 in the fourth and so forth, untill it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
1000, he will find the greater difficulty, the longer
he pulls. 'Tis just so with Air, or Water, raising Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in a Tub; for as the Cylinder of the Mercury grows
higher by rising, so it becomes heavier, and consequently
the imaginary surface, upon which the <hi>Base</hi> of the Pillar
rests, is more and more burdened, and so becomes less and less
able to press it up. This leads us to a clear discovery of the
reason, why 'tis more difficult by suction, to pull up Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
in a Pipe, than to pull up Water; and more hard to
suck up ten foot of Water, then to suck up five. For trial
of this, which is soon done, take a slender Glass-pipe 30
or 40 inches long, open at both ends, and drown the one
end among <hi>Quick-silver,</hi> and put your mouth to the other,
and having sucked, you will find greater difficulty to pull
up thorow the Pipe 15 inches of Mercury, than to pull up
10, or 8; and far greater difficulty to suck up 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than to
pull up 15. It may be objected, that if a man had strength
sufficient in his Lungs, to suck out the whole Air of the
Pipe, thirty inches of Mercury would come as easily up, as
three, which seemes to prove, that the difficulty of the
Mercurie's up-coming, depends not upon the weakness of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106992:48"/>
the Air, but upon the weakness of the Lungs, and want of
strength to suck. I answer, though a man were able to
suck out the whole Air of the Pipe, yet 30 inches, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ascend so easily, as ten, nor ten so easily as three, and that
for the reasons already given. But why is it then, (say
you) that the stronger the suction be, the higher the
Mercury ascends in the Pipe? I answer, the suction serves
for no use, but to remove the impediment, that hinders the
Mercury from coming up, which is nothing else, but the
Air within the Pipe. Now, the more of this Air that's
taken away by suction, (the stronger the suction is, the
more Air is taken away) the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arder up comes the Mercury.
But why ought there to be difficulty in the suction of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
to the altitude of 15 or 20 inches, more than in the
suction of Water to that altitude? I answer, when I suck
Water up thorow a Pipe, the suction of the Air above it,
is easie; because the ascending Water helpes much to drive
it up to the mouth, the outward Air driving up both,
But the suction is difficult in Mercury, because the ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
liquor, does not help so much, to drive up the Air to
the mouth, as the Water does. And the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Air, being more burdened with 15 inches of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
than with 15 inches of Water, cannot so easily drive
up the one as the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her, and so Mercury cannot so easily
drive up the Air of the Pipe to the mouth, as Water does.
In a word, according to the difference of <hi>specifick</hi> weight,
between Water and Mercury, so is the difficulty of sucti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
therefore, because Mercury is 14 times heavier than
Water, there is 14 times more difficulty, to pull up the one,
than the other. Note, that <hi>suction</hi> is not taken here
strictly, as contradistinguished from <hi>pulsion;</hi> but in a large
sense, as it may comprehend it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:106992:48"/>
To proceed a little further, let us suppose the Pillar of
Mercury (see the 11. Figure) G H, that's raised by the
surface of Air F G, to be 29 inches, and every inch to
weigh one ounce. Secondly, that the said surface has 29
degrees of power or force in it: for in all counterpoises the
<hi>Pondus</hi> and the <hi>Potentia</hi> are equal; therefore, if the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
be 29 inches, the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the surface must have
29 degrees of strength or force in it, to counterballance
the <hi>Pondus.</hi> These things being supposed, which are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
let us imagine the surface of Air, to raise the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
one inch above F G. In this case, the surface is
weaker than it was; which I prove evidently, because it
is now but able to raise 28 of Mercury. Imagine next,
the said surface to have raised the Mercury two inches
above F G, then it follows, that it must be yet weaker,
because it's now but able to raise 27 inches: for by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
two ounce of the <hi>Pondus,</hi> it loseth two degrees of
it's own <hi>Potentia.</hi> In rai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing three inches of Mercury, it
is three degrees weaker; and in raising four, it is four de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
weaker, and so forth; therefore, having raised 28
inches, there is but one degree of force remaining in the
surface. And when it hath raised the whole, namely 29,
it is no more able, and can no more press. For confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
put the case that the surface of Air F G, were as
able, and had as much Pressure in it, after it hath raised 29
inches of Mercury, as it is after the raising of 10; then
it follows of necessity, that after the raising of 20, it shall
raise 19 moe, which is impossible, seing the greatest alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
is 29. It follows of necessity, (I say) because af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the raising of 10, it is able to raise 19 moe: therefore
if it be as able after 20, as after 10, it must raise 19 after
20. Yea, if it be as able after 20 as 10, it must be as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106992:49"/>
able after 29 as 10. If this be, then it may raise other 29,
and a third 29, and so <hi>in infinitum.</hi> Therefore, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that when two Fluid Bodies are in <hi>equilibrio</hi> one
with another; or when the <hi>pondus</hi> is equal to the <hi>poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
none of them doth actually press upon another, at least
the surface hath lost all its Power and Pressure, which is
also evident in the Pillar. For understanding this, let us
suppose A C B (Figure 11.) to be a Pipe 58 inches long,
and full of Mercury, and every inch of it to weigh one
ounce. Now, when the orifice D is opened, there is here
as great an inequality, between the <hi>pondus</hi> and the <hi>potentia</hi>
of the surface of Air E B, on which it rests, as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the surface F G, and the <hi>pondus</hi> of Mercury H G.
For as F G had 29 degrees of power to raise G H, so the
Pillar A B has 29 ounce of weight, to overcome the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
E B. And as the surface F G, became one degree
weaker, by raising one inch of the Mercury H G, and two
degrees weaker, by raising two inches, and so forward, till
it lost all its Pressure; so the Pillar, by falling down one
inch, loseth one ounce of the weight; by falling down
two, it loseth two ounce, and so forward, till by falling
down from A to C, it loseth all its Weight and Pressure.</p>
               <p>But here occurreth a difficulty; for if the surface F G,
hath lost all its Pressure, by raising the Mercury from G to
H; and if the Pillar C B, hath lost all its Pressure, by fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down from A to C; it follows, that when a Pillar of
a Fluid, and a surface of a Fluid are in equal termes, or
brought to an <hi>equipondium,</hi> there is no Pressure in them at
all. For answer, consider first, that in all counterpoises,
there are necessarily two things, the <hi>movens</hi> and the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
the thing that moves, and the thing that is moved.
Secondly, you must consider the <hi>motum,</hi> to have a <hi>pondu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:106992:49"/>
or weight in it, and the <hi>movens</hi> to have a <hi>potentia,</hi> or power,
wherewith it moves that weight. Thirdly, that as the
thing that moves, hath a power or force in it self, whereby
it moves, so the thing that is moved hath a power or force
in it self, whereby it resists the motion. Fourthly, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the resistance of the thing <hi>moved,</hi> may exceed the
power of the <hi>movent,</hi> as when a Quarrier with a Leaver,
endeavours to prize up a stone too heavy for him: or the
power of the <hi>movent,</hi> may exceed the resistance of the
<hi>weight;</hi> or both may be of equal power. Consider fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that as the <hi>pondus</hi> of the thing moved, begins to grow
more and more, so the power of the <hi>movent</hi> decreaseth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably;
not absolutely, as heat is extinguished in
Water by the cold Air, when it is removed from the Fire,
but respectively. For example, when a man holds a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
in his hand, with six pound in the one scale, and but
one pound in the other, if you add another pound, the
weight grows more, and the power and force of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
scale grows less proportionably; not <hi>absolutely,</hi> for it
still remains six pound, but <hi>respectively:</hi> that's to say, six
pound is less in respect of four, than in respect of five; or
the resistance of six pound is less, two counterpoising it,
than being counterpoised by one. When a third is added,
the weight grows yet more, and consequently the resistance
of the opposite scale becomes yet less, till by adding the
sixth and last pound, you augment and encrease the <hi>pondus</hi>
to that same degree of strength, that the resistance of the
opposite scale is of. From these considerations, I say,
the surface of Air F G, hath not lost all its Pressure <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,</hi>
by raising the Mercury from G to H, but only
<hi>respectively,</hi> because it still retains 29 degrees of force in
it self. I say <hi>respectively,</hi> because when the Mercury is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106992:50"/>
raised ten inches, the power of the Air which is of 29 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of force, is less in respect of ten ounce, then in respect
of five; or the power of 29 degrees of force is less, being
counterpoised by ten ounce, than being counterpoised on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by five. And when it is raised 20, it is yet less in this
respect, than in respect of ten. And when it has raised
the Mercury to the greatest altitude H, it may be said to
have lost all its Pressure, seing it is not able, by vertue of
a counterpoise, to do any more. Even as six pound in this
scale, may be said to have lost all its resistance and weight,
by putting in the other scale, first one pound, next two
pound, and then three pound, till the last be put in, at
which time it hath no more resistance. Though this be,
yet it still remains six pound. Even so, the Air F G still
remains of the same force and power, while it suspends
the Mercury G H, that it was of before. Likewise, the
Pillar A B, cannot be said to have lost all its pressure <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,</hi>
by falling down from A to C, but only <hi>respectively,</hi>
because the said Pillar C B, is still 29 ounce weight. I
say <hi>respectively,</hi> because in falling down ten inches, or in
losing ten ounce, the weight that's now but 48, is less, in
respect of 29, than while it was 58. It is yet less, when it
hath fallen down other ten, because being now but 38, it
must be yet less in respect of 29, than 48. And when it
hath fallen down to C 29, it may be said to have lost all its
weight, because it can do no more, having <hi>respectively</hi> lost
all its Pressure.</p>
               <p>From what is said, we see a clear ground to distinguish
in Fluids a <hi>pondus</hi> and a <hi>potentia.</hi> Secondly, that the <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia</hi>
may sometimes exceed the <hi>pondus,</hi> and contrariwise
the <hi>pondus</hi> may exceed the <hi>potentia.</hi> Thirdly, that ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
of weight, between the <hi>pondus</hi> and the <hi>potentia,</hi> is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106992:50"/>
the cause of motion of Fluids. Fourthly, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
never ceaseth, till the <hi>pondus</hi> and the <hi>potentia</hi> become
of equal force. This conclusion is not so universal as the
rest, because the motion may sometimes cease, before this
be. For example, when the Air is p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>ing Mercury up
thorow a Tub shorter then 29 inches, the motion ends
before there be a perfect counterpoise; for 20 or 15 inches
of Mercury, can never counterballance the force and power
of the Air. In such a case then, there is an unequal Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
the Air pressing the Mercury more, than the Mercury
doth the Air.</p>

               <p>TAke the Vessel A B C D, and fill it with Water,
as high as H I. Take next a Cylinder of <hi>stone</hi> F G,
and drowning the half of it among the Water, suspend it
with a chord to the beam N O, with a ring at E. Now
in this case, though the stone do not touch the bottom of
the Vessel, yet the Water becomes heavier, than before.
For discovering the true reason of this, I suppose first, the
weight of the Water, before the <hi>stone</hi> be drow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed, to be
40 pound. I suppose next, that after the <hi>stone</hi> is drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the said Water to weigh 50 pound. And lastly, the
<hi>stone</hi> to weigh 60 pound. I say then, the Water must be
10 pound heavier than before, because it supports 10 pound
of the <hi>stone.</hi> 'Tis certain the beam is less burdened by
10 pound than before. If this be, then surely the Water
must sustain it. It were great temerity and rashness, to
averr that neither the Beam, nor the Water sustains it,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106992:51"/>
which is really to say, it is sustained by nothing. It cannot
be said without ignorance, that 10 pound of the <hi>stone</hi> is
evanished, and turned into a <hi>Chimera.</hi> If it be said, how
can such a Fluid Body as Water, be able to support any
part of the weight of the <hi>stone,</hi> that is such a heavy Body?
I answer, there is here no difficulty, for if the imaginary
surface K L, upon which the 10 pound of the stone rests,
be able to sustain 10 pound of Water (I suppose the <hi>stone</hi>
taken away, and the place of it filled with Water) then
surely it must also be able to sustain 10 pound of the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
metal; seing ten pound of Lead, or Gold, or Stone, is
no heavier than 10 pound of VVater. If some say, this
rather seems to be the reason, why the Water becomes
heavier, after the <hi>stone</hi> is drowned, because it possesseth
the place of as much Water, as would weigh 10 pound;
not (as was said) because the VVater supports 10 pound
of it. Therefore it may be judged, and thought, that if
the space that the <hi>stone</hi> occupies, were filled with Air, or
some light Body, without sensible weight, the VVater
would become heavier than before. For example, if in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stead
of the <hi>stone,</hi> there were placed a <hi>bladder</hi> full of wind,
within the VVater, and tied to the bottom with a string,
that the surface might swell from H I to A B, the VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Vessel would become as much heavier than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as is the bulk of VVater, equal to the quantity of the
<hi>bladder.</hi> Therefore, the VVater becomes heavier, not
because it supports any part of the <hi>stone,</hi> but because the
<hi>stone</hi> occupies as much room and space, as would contain
10 pound of VVater: for by this means the drowned <hi>stone</hi>
raiseth the VVater from H I to A B; and so the Cylinders
A C, and B D, being higher, press with greater weight
upon the bottom C D, even with as much more weight,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106992:51"/>
as if the space that the <hi>stone</hi> occupies were filled with
VVater.</p>
               <p>For answer to this, we shall make this following Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment.
Take the Vessel M P V X, and fill it with VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to Q R. Next, take a large <hi>bladder</hi> W Y full of wind,
and tying the neck with a threed, thrust it below the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and fasten it to the bottom, with a string, to the Ring
Z. This done, the Water swells, and rises from Q R,
to M P. Now, if it be true, that the Water in the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
becomes heavier, not because it supports 10 pound
weight of the <hi>stone,</hi> but because the <hi>stone</hi> occupies the
room of 10 pound of Water; then it ought to follow,
that after the <hi>bladder</hi> is tyed below the Water, the said
Water should become heavier, than before, even by three
pound; for I suppose a bulk of Water, equal to the bulk of
the <hi>bladder,</hi> to weigh as much. And the reason is, because
(as you say) the quantity of the <hi>bladder</hi> W Y, makes the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
swell from Q R to M P, by which means the Pillars of
Water M V, and P X becomes higher, and so presseth with
greater weight upon the bottom V X. For clearing this
difficulty, I say, when a <hi>bladder</hi> is thus below the VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
tyed to the bottom, the VVater becomes not three
pound heavier: for when you place the Vessel with the
VVater and <hi>bladder,</hi> in the Scale of a Ballance, the said
VVater weighs no more, than if it wanted the <hi>bladder:</hi>
therefore the VVater becomes not heavier, because the
<hi>stone</hi> possesseth the room of 10 pound of Water, but because
the Water sustains 10 pound of the <hi>stone.</hi> Now the reason,
why the <hi>bladder</hi> makes not the water heavier, though it
raise it from Q R to M P, is this; because though verily
there be a greater Pressure then before, even upon the
bottom of the Vessel, yet because moe parts are not added,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106992:52"/>
the <hi>natural weight</hi> cannot be augmented, which essential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
depends upon the addition of these parts. If it be replyed,
the Experiment of the <hi>bladder</hi> is to no purpose, because it
being knit to the bottom, pulls up the Vessel, with as great
force, as the growth of the Pressure bears it down, and so
the <hi>Bladder</hi> cannot make the Water heavier. But, if so
be, it were possible, that the <hi>Bladder</hi> could remaine within
the middle of the Water, without being knit to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
and consequently without pulling up the Vessel, then
surely the Pillars of Water M V, and P X, being higher,
would press with greater weight upon the bottom, and so
make the Vessel, and the Water weigh more in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance:
for 'tis to be supposed, that during all this time, this
Vessel with the Water, is in one scale, and a great weight
of stone or lead, in the other. So would the Water A
B C D become heavier likewise, provided the space and
room, that the <hi>stone</hi> fills among the Water, remained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
after the stone is taken away: because that room and
empty space remaining, would keep the surface, as high
as A B, by which means, the Pillars A C and B D, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
higher, would press with greater weight upon the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
and cause the Water weigh more in the ballance.
I answer, though by some extraordinary <hi>power,</hi> the <hi>bladder</hi>
could remain below the water, of its own accord, as it were,
and though the space and room, by that same <hi>power,</hi> which
is left by the <hi>stone,</hi> were keeped empty, yet shall they
never be able to make the Water heavier. As to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that's brought, I answer, the rising and swelling of
the Pillars, will make indeed a greater Pressure upon the
bottom of the Vessel, but because this Pressure may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and generated without the addition of new parts,
therefore, it can never make the Water heavier: for if this
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106992:52"/>
were true, then it would follow, that the more a body is
comprest, it should be the heavier, which is contrary to
sense, and experience. This Pressure is like unto <hi>Bensil,</hi>
that cannot weigh in a ballance, though the <hi>thing bended</hi>
do weigh; as a Bow that weighs so many pounds, but the
<hi>Bensil</hi> of it weighs nothing: Next, will any man think,
that a Cub of Water six foot high, and six foot thick, will
weigh more in a ballance, then it did, after it is turned into
a long square Pillar 216 inches high? I grant, there is near
60 times a greater Pressure, upon the bottom of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
yet because this Pressure is generated, without the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of new parts, it cannot make the Water heavier.
Moreover, it is <hi>mechanically</hi> possible to keep the VVater
S T V X, under that same degree of Pressure it hath,
though the rest above were taken away: if this be, then it
ought to be as heavy, as the whole, seing it still Presses the
bottom, with that same degree of Pressure, it had from
the whole: but what is more absurd, than to say, one part
of VVater, is as heavy, as the whole? <hi>e. g.</hi> a pint as heavy
as a gallon. If it be said, the Pressure, and the weight, are
but one thing, at least <hi>effectively,</hi> which is sufficient to the
purpose in hand, as is clear from the Theorem 23. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
they are but one thing indeed, in order to the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of Nature,</hi> but they are neither <hi>formally,</hi> nor <hi>effectively</hi>
the same thing in order to the <hi>Libra</hi> or <hi>Artificial Ballance,</hi>
whereof we are now treating. I shall conclude with this;
while the Vessel with the VVater, is thus placed in the
Scale of the Ballance, and in <hi>equilibrio,</hi> with the opposite
Scale, cut the string that tyes the <hi>bladder</hi> to the bottom,
and when it comes above, you will find the VVater, just
of the same weight it was of: for though the surface M P,
by taking out the <hi>bladder,</hi> settle down to Q R, yet there's
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106992:53"/>
no alteration made in the weight. From this I gather,
that if the swelling of the VVater should make it heavier,
then the subsiding and falling down of it, ought to make
it lighter.</p>
               <p>From these Experiments we gather first, that in VVater
there is a Pressure, because it sustains 10 pound of the <hi>stone</hi>
F G. Secondly, that whatever heavy body is weighed
in Water, it loseth just as much of its weight, as the bulk
of Water weighs, it puts out of its place. This is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
because the <hi>stone</hi> is 10 pound lighter in VVater,
than in the Air, because the VVater that would fill the
room of the <hi>stone,</hi> is just of that weight. VVe see third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the <hi>Pressure</hi> of VVater, and the <hi>natural weight</hi>
of it, are two things really distinct; because the <hi>Pressure</hi>
may be augmented, without any increment of the <hi>natural
weight.</hi> VVe see fourthly, that the <hi>Pressure,</hi> or <hi>Bensil</hi> of
a Fluid, cannot affect the Scale of a Ballance, but only the
<hi>natural weight.</hi> VVe see fifthly, that a body naturally
heavier than Water, <hi>weighs in Water,</hi> because the <hi>stone</hi>
F G, makes the Water about it, 10 pound heavier. If it
be inquired, whether bodies, that are naturally lighter, will
<hi>weigh in Water?</hi> I answer, if they be of any sensible weight,
they weigh, as well as the other. For this cause, I except
Air. For though they were never so light, in respect of
Water, yet if they have any considerable gravity with
them, they will make the Water heavier, they are among.
Put the case the Body were a Cube of Timber of six
inches, weighing sixteen ounces, and that a Cube of Water
of that quantity, weighed 112 ounces. Here's a great ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality,
between their <hi>natural weights:</hi> yet if that piece of
Timber, were made to exist in the middle of Water, as
the <hi>Bladder</hi> doth, it would make it 16 ounces heavier.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106992:53"/>
The reason is this; these 16 ounces are either supported by a
surface of Water, or they support themselves. This last is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.
If the VVater support them, then must they make
the said VVater 16 ounces heavier. Note, that though
a Body naturally lighter then VVater, as <hi>Cork,</hi> may be
said to <hi>weigh in Water,</hi> that's to say, to make it heavier,
in which sense VVater <hi>weighs in Water,</hi> because if you
add a pint to a gallon, it makes it heavier; yet if you take
a piece of <hi>Cork,</hi> and knit it to the Scale of a Ballance, by a
threed, the <hi>Cork</hi> hanging among the VVater, the Scale
hanging above in the Air, it will not <hi>weigh in Water;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in this sense, no Body <hi>weighs in Water,</hi> but that
which is naturally heavier then VVater, as Lead, or Stone.
In this sense, VVater doth not <hi>weigh in Water,</hi> as will be
seen in the 17 Experiment.</p>

Figure 13.</head>
               <p>Take a Glass-pipe 70 inches long or there-about, and of
any wideness, having the upper end H, <hi>hermetically</hi>
sealed, the <hi>lower</hi> end C compleatly open, and fill it with
Mercury, and cause a <hi>Diver</hi> carry it down to the ground
of the sea M N, where I suppose is standing the Vessel
A B D E with stagnant Mercury, and drown the end
below the surface A B. This being done, the Mercury
falls from the upper end H, to the point G, and there
halts; the space H G being empty. For understanding
this Experiment, I shall propose several questions, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
them. First, what's the reason, why the Mercury
subsides, and sinks down from H to G? I answer, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106992:54"/>
in the like cases, inequality of weight between the
<hi>Pondus</hi> of the impending <hi>Quick-silver,</hi> and the <hi>Potentia</hi> of
the surface, of the stagnant <hi>Quick-silver</hi> D C E. For
while the Tub is compleatly full, the weight is so great,
that the surface D C E, is not able to sustain it, therefore
it must fall down, seing motion necessarily followes in
Fluids, upon inequality of weight. It may be inquired se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
why it halts at G, 58 inches from A B, and
comes no further down? I answer it halts at G, because
when it hath fallen down to that point, there happens equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of weight, between the suspended Pillar, and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
surface: for whatever weight the said Pillar is of, the
surface on which it rests, is of the same. In a word, the
<hi>Pondus</hi> of the one, and the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the other are now
equal. For understanding this, consider according to the
25 Theorem, that the weight of the Element of Air, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the surfaces of waters, is equivalent to the burden of 34
foot of water, therefore the first and visible surface of this
Water L I K, is really as much prest, with the burden of
the <hi>Atmosphere,</hi> as if it had 34 foot of Water upon it.
Consider next, that between the said surface, and the ground
M N, are 34 foot of Water indeed. Consider thirdly,
that a Pillar of Water 34 foot high, is exactly of the
same weight, with a Pillar of Mercury 29 inches high;
for if Water be 14 times lighter than Mercury, then they
cannot be of equal weight, unless the one be 14 times
higher than the other. Now, supposing the weight of the
Air upon the surface L I K, to be equivalent to 34 foot
of Water, or (which is the same thing) to 29 inches of
Mercury, the surface of the stagnant Mercury A B, must
be as much burdened with the incumbing Water, and the
Air together, as if it had really resting upon it, a Pillar of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106992:54"/>
Mercury 58 inches high. If this be, then it follows by
necessity, that there must be an equality of weight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>pondus</hi> of the Mercury in the Tub, and the
<hi>potentia</hi> of the surface D C E; Or (which is all one thing)
that the part C, on which the Pillar rests, is no more bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened,
than the part D or E. For if 34 foot of Water,
and 34 foot of VVater, be equivalent for weight, to 58
inches of Mercury, then must the part D and E, be as
much burdened with the said weight, as the part C is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
with the Pillar within the Tub, seing both are of
the same height: therefore the power, and force of the
imaginary surface of the stagnant Mercury D C E, is of the
same strength, with the weight of the Pillar G F B. And
this lets us see the reason, why the whole 70 inches cannot
be suspended; for if the outward Pressure that's upon A B,
be but equivalent to the Pressure of 58, it can never make
the surface D C E able to support 70.</p>
               <p>To make it evident (if any doubt) that the Mercury
is suspended by the weight of the Water, and the weight
of the Air superadded, let a <hi>Diver</hi> bring up this Engine to
the top of the Water, and he will find the one half to
have fallen down, namely from G to F, the other half
F B remaining. And if it were possible, to convey this
Experiment to the top of the Air, the Bearer would see,
the remaining half to fall down likewise, and become level
with A B; for where no Pressure of Air is, there can be
no Mercury suspended. This falling down, is not all at
once, but by degrees, and keeps a proportion with the
Pressure of the Air, that grows less and less, from the
ground to the top.</p>
               <p>From this Experiment we see first, the great Pressure
and weight, the Elements of Air and Water are under,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106992:55"/>
seing this Water, that's but 34 foot deep, sustains the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
between G and F, 29 inches, as much between F
and E, being kept up by the Pressure of the Air. We see
secondly, that this Pressure is according to <hi>Arithmetical
Progression,</hi> as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. because in going down the
first 14 inches, the Mercury rises one inch; in going down the
second 14 inches, it rises two; in going down the third
14 inches, it rises three, and so forward. We see third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
though a VVater were 100 fathom deep, yea 1000, yet
the Pressure of the Air above is found at the bottom:
for supposing this Experiment were 100 fathom deep, yet
would the Air from above have influence upon it, to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
so many inches of the Mercurial Cylinder. A <hi>Diver</hi>
then, 10 or 15 fathom under the VVater, must be burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the weight of the Air, as well as with the weight
of the VVater, so must the Fishes, though never so deep.
We see fourthly, that the parts of a Fluid cannot cease
from motion, so long as there is an inequality of
weight between the <hi>pondus</hi> and the <hi>potentia.</hi> This is
clear from the falling down of the Mercury from H to
G. And assoon as equality of weight happens, the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ends. This is clear from the Mercurie's halting at G.
Fifthly, that in Mercury, as well as in Water, or Air,
surfaces may be distinguished, and that these surfaces, are
endowed with a <hi>Potentia</hi> or power, begotten in them by
superior and extrinsick weight. This is clear from the
imaginary surface D C E, that's made powerful to support
58 inches of Mercury in the Tub, and that by the weight
and Pressure of the Air resting upon A B. Sixthly, that,
as two Fluids differ in <hi>specifick</hi> and natural weight, so they
differ in <hi>altitude,</hi> when they counterpoise one another.
This is clear from the disproportion that's between the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106992:55"/>
of the Mercury suspended, and the height of the
Water, and Air suspending. G F then is 29 inches, and
the deepness of the Water from K to N is 34 foot, because
Water is naturally 14 times lighter than Mercury. F B is
likewise 29 inches, and the hight of the Air, that rests
upon the surface of Water is six or seven thousand fathom
high; because Air is 14000 times <hi>naturally</hi> lighter than
Mercury. Seventhly, that Fluid Bodies counterpoise one
another, not according to their <hi>thickness</hi> and <hi>breadth,</hi> but
only according to their <hi>altitude.</hi> This is evident; for
though this Tub were never so wide or narrow, yet the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of the Mercury is unchangeable. Hence it is, that
the <hi>thickest.</hi> Pillar of Water in the Ocean, is not able
to suspend more Mercury, than the <hi>slenderest,</hi> I mean as to
altitude. And hence it is, that the smallest Cylinder of
Mercury, no thicker than a silk threed, is able to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise
a Pillar of Water, of any thickness whatsoever.
We may conclude lastly, that when a <hi>Diver</hi> is 20 fathom
under the Water, he is under as much burden, as if he were
under 14 or 15 foot of Quick-silver. Suppose a man lying
on his belly, within a large Vessel, and 14 or 15 foot of
Mercury poured in upon him, surely it may be thought,
that such a burden were insupportable. But put the case,
the <hi>Diver</hi> were down 40 fathom, then must the burden
be doubled. This follows, because if a Pillar of Water
34 foot high, with the weight of the Air superadded, be
as heavy, as 58 inches of Mercury, then surely a Pillar 20
fathom high, or 100 foot, must be as heavy as 170 inches,
which is more than 14 foot.</p>

               <head>EXPERIMENT X.
Figure 14.</head>
               <p>AGainst the former Experiment, there occurres some
difficulties, which must be answered. As first, if it
be the Pressure of the Water, that sustains the Mercury in
the Tub (see the 13. Figure) then the weight of the said
Mercury ought not to be found, while the Tub is poi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed
between a mans Fingers. But so it is, that when a <hi>Diver</hi>
grips the Tub about the middle, and raises it a little from
the bottom of the Vessel, he not only finds the weight of
the Tub it self, but the weight also of the 58 inches of
Mercury that's within it. But this ought not to be, if the
said Mercury, be sustained by the outward Water. In a
word, it ought not to be found, because the said Pillar of
Mercury, as really stands, and rests upon the imaginary sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
D C E, as a Cylinder of Brass or Stone, rests upon a
plain Table of Timber or Stone. If then, it be support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the said surface, why ought I to find the weight of
it, when I lift up the Pipe a little from the bottom of the
Vessel? For clearing this difficulty, consider, that when
the Mercury falls down from H to G, it leaves a so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of
<hi>vac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ity</hi> behind it, wherein there is neither Air nor Water.
Consider secondly, that for this cause, there happens an
unequal Pressure; the top of the Tub without, being bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
with the Pillar of Water I H, which actually
presseth it down, and nothing within between G and H,
that may counterballance that downward Pressure. These
things being considered, I answer to the difficulty and say,
it is not the weight of the suspended Mercury that I find,
but the weight of the Pillar of Water I H, that rests up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106992:56"/>
the top of the Tub. If it be said, the Pressure of a
Fluid is <hi>insensible,</hi> and cannot be found. I answer, it's true,
when the Pressure is equal and uniform, but not when the
Pressure is unequal, as here. If it be asked, how comes
it to pass, that the Pillar of Water I H, is exactly the
weight of the 58 inches of Mercury? I answer, besides
the said Pillar, there is another of Air, that rests upon the
top of it, which two together are exactly the weight of the
suspended Mercury; I H being of the same weight with
the Mercury G F, and the foresaid Pillar of Air, being of
the same weight with the Mercury F B. To make it more
evident, remember that one inch of Mercury, is exactly
the weight of 14 inches of Water; and that one inch of
Mercury, is of the same weight with 14000 inches of Air.
If this be, then must the Pillar of VVater I H, that's 34
foot high, and of the same thickness with the 29 inches of
Mercury G F, be of the same weight with it, seing 29
inches are to be found 14 times in 34 foot. For the same
reason, is the Pillar of Air, namely S I, that rests upon
the top of the Pillar of VVater I H, of the same weight
with the 29 inches of Mercury F B. For after a just rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning,
you will find, that 29 inches will be found 14000
times in the Pillar of Air, that rests upon the Pillar I H.
Or in a word, the hight of the Air is 14000 times, 29
inches.</p>
               <p>But here occurrs another difficulty. Let us suppose there
were a Tub six foot high, one inch wide, having the sides,
3 inches thick. Imagine likewise the said Tub to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the water 34 foot, with 58 inches of Mercury in it, as
is represented in this 14 Figure. This being supposed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Pillar of Water E A F C G D, must be far heavier,
than the 58 inches of Mercury H B. The reason is clear,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106992:57"/>
because the said Pillar, is not only 34 foot high, but as
thick, as the Diameter of the Tub, whose sides are three
inches thick. I answer, the whole weight of that Water
E A F C G D is not found, while a man poises the Tub
between his fingers, but only the weight of the part G A,
which is exactly the weight of the Mercury H B. But
here occurrs the great question, namely, why I find only
the weight of the Water G A, and nothing of the weight
of the Water, C E, or D F? I answer, I cannot find the
Pressure of the Water C E, because it is counterpoised
with the upward Pressure of the Water I K. And for the
same reason, I cannot find the weight of the Water D F,
because it is counterpoised by L M; but because there is
nothing between H and A, to counterpoise the downward
Pressure of the Water G A, therefore I find that. If it
be objected, that the Water I K, cannot counterpoise the
Water C E, because the one is farder down than the
other, and consequently under a greater Pressure, than the
other. I answer, though I K be stronger than C E, yet
a compensation is made by the weight of the Tub. For
understanding this, let us suppose the Water C E, and D F,
to press downward with the weight of six pound, and the
Water K I, and L M, to press upward with the weight
of ten pound, there being four pound in difference. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
next, the Tub to weigh in the Air ten pound, and
in the Water only six pound. If this be, then according
to the eighth Experiment, and eighteenth Theorem, four
pound weight of the Tub must rest upon the surface I L.
And if this be, then must the Water I K, and L M, be
four pound weaker with the Tub, than without it, and
must only have six pound of upward Pressure.</p>

                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:106992:59"/>
From these Experiments we conclude first, the truth of
the tenth Theorem, namely that the weight of a Fluid is
only found by sense, when the Pressure is not uniform, and
equal. This is evident from our finding the weight of the
Pillar of Water I H, as in the 13 Figure. We conclude
secondly, that in all Fluids, there is a <hi>pondus</hi> and a <hi>poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi>
as is clear from the <hi>pondus</hi> of Water E A F C G D;
that presseth down the Tub, and the <hi>potentia</hi> of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I K L M, that presseth up the same Tub. We see
thirdly, that there cannot be two surfaces of Water dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
in altitude, but they must differ in degrees of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
because the surface E A F, is weaker, than the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
I L, that being higher than this. We see fourthly,
that two surfaces differing in strength, may be made equal
by some Body or other interveening; because, though I L
be stronger than E A F, yet seing it supports four pound of
the Tub, it presseth up with no more force, than E A F,
presseth down with. We see fifthly, that a Body suspended
in a Fluid, as in Air, or in VVater, may have one part of it
prest equally with that Fluid, and another part unequally:
this is evident, because the parts E and F, are equally
prest with the Pillars C E, and D F, seing this Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is counterpoised with the Pressure of VVater, I K,
and L M. But the middle part of the Tub A, is unequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prest, seing it is prest downward, with the VVater G A,
but not prest upward with the Mercury B H. VVe see
sixthly, that whatever be the thickness of a Pillar of a
Fluid; yet no more of its weight is found, or is sensible,
than the part, which presseth unequally: for though
E A F C G D, be a Pillar six or seven inches thick, yet
no more of the Pressure is sensible, than what comes from
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106992:60"/>
G A. VVe see seventhly, that a Body equally prest
with a Fluid, weighs less, but a Body unequally prest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
weighs none at all. This is clear in many particulars; for
a Stone weighed in VVater, loseth not all the weight, but
a pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, because it is equally pressed. But a Body unequally
prest, as is the Mercury H B, hath no weight at all, as
it now stands. For understanding this, you must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that the whole weight of it tests upon the surface of
VVater I L. Therefore though it could be weighed by a
string, passing from the top H, to a Ballance existing in
the Air; yet the said Ballance would find none of its
weight, seing it is wholly suspended by the VVater;
but a Stone so weighed, is only suspended in part, by the
Water.</p>

Figure 15.</head>
               <p>A M Z C is a Water 15 foot deep. A B a Glass-tub
14 inches long, and full of Mercury. B C a Pillar
of Water 13 foot, 10 inches high, thorow whose middle
goes a string to the scale of the Ballance K, existing in
the Air. D E is a Tub full of Mercury 28 inches long,
with a Pillar of Water above it E F, 12 foot and eight
inches. G H a Tub 42 inches long, with a Pillar of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
above it H I, 11 foot and six inches high. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
A D G S M an imaginary surface, 15 foot deep. This
Experiment is brought hither, to demonstrate that a heavy
Body, weighs as much in Water, as in Air, which is point-blank
to the common received opinion, and destructive of
the 18 Theorem. To evince this, I must suppose the 14
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106992:60"/>
inches of Mercury in the Tub A B to weigh 14 ounce;
and the 28 inches of Mercury D E, to weigh 28 ounce;
the 42 inches G H to weigh (I mean in the Air) 42 ounce.
Now I say, to make a just <hi>equipondium</hi> between the two
Scales K and L, there must be 14 ounce put into the
Scale L. If after this manner you weigh the Tub and
Mercury D E, 28 ounces will be required in the Scale L,
and 42, if you weigh the Tub and Mercury G H. For
proving this Doctrine, I must appeal to Experience, which
will not fail in this. If you reply, and say, upon supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Tub and Mercury G H, were a solid piece of brass,
or iron thus suspended in the Water, ought it not to weigh
less here than in the Air, even as much less, as is the weight
of the quantity of Water, it puts out of its place: why
then should not the Pipe H G, with the Mercury in it, do
the same, seing there is no apparent difference between
them, as to this?</p>
               <p>But to leave this, which will appear afterwards, and to
let the Reader see the truth of the 18 Theorem, I affirm,
'tis not the weight of the 14 ounces of Mercury A B, that
burdens the scale of the Ballance K, and that makes a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise
with the 14 ounces of Stone, or Lead, thats in the
scale L. What then is it, you say? I answer, 'tis 14
ounces of the Pillar of Water B C that does this. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth the weight of the 28 ounces of Mercury D E
burden the Ballance, but only 28 ounces of the Water E F.
Neither doth the Ballance support the weight of the 42
ounces of Mercury G H, but it is only burdened with 42
ounces of the Water H I. The reason is most evident,
because according to the Principles of the <hi>Hydrostaticks</hi>
already laid down, the Cylinder of Mercury A B, within
the Tub A B, rests immediatly upon the imaginary sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106992:61"/>
of the Water A D G, and therefore cannot bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
the scale in any wise. The same is true of the
other two Cylinders of Mercury. But in this I find small
difficulty. The greater is, how to make it out, that the
scale K, supports 14 ounces of the Water B C, and 28 of
the Water E F, and 42 of the Water H I. To make
this seem probable, consider first, as was noted, that this
VVater is 15 foot deep, and consequently the Pillar of
VVater B C, 13 foot 10 inches. The VVater E F 12
foot eight inches. And H I, 11 foot and a half. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
secondly, though this be true, yet we must count the
Pillar of VVater Z M 49 foot high. The reason is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
because the Pressure of the Air, upon the surface of
all Waters (according to the 25 Theorem) is equivalent
to 34 foot of Water: this then being added to 15, makes
49, and by this reckoning the Water B C is 47 foot ten
inches: the Water E F 46 foot eight inches: And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Water H I 45 foot six inches. Thirdly, for easie
counting, I must suppose the whole Cylinder Z M to
weigh 42 ounces, every 14 inches one ounce: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the Water B C to weigh 41 ounces; the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
E F to weigh 40 ounces; the Water H I 39 ounces.
Note, that in <hi>Physical</hi> demonstrations, 'tis not needful to
use <hi>Mathematical</hi> strictness in counting; and so leaving
out fractions, we shall onely use round numbers. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
fourthly, that in all Fluids, as hath been frequently
marked, there is a <hi>pondus</hi> and <hi>potentia,</hi> the Water B C be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>pondus,</hi> and the Mercury A B the <hi>potentia,</hi> the one
striving to press down the Tub, the other striving to press
it up. Consider fifthly, that by how much the more a
Body suspended in a Fluid is pressed up, by so much the
less the weight that presseth it down is fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:106992:61"/>
by how much the less it is pressed up, by so much
the more the Pressure above is found. Consider sixthly,
the less that a surface of Water is burdened, the more able
it is to counterballance the opposite Pressure, and the more
it is burdened, it is the less able. Consider seventhly, that
the Mercury A B, (which is evident in all Fluids) not
only presseth downward, and burdens the surface A D G,
but also presseth upward, and therefore actually endeavours
to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ust up the Tub; and so it is, that the Tub is pressed
between two, namely between the Water C B, and the
Mercury within it.</p>
               <p>Now from these considerations I say, the scale K, must
support, and bear up 14 ounce of the Water B C: for seing
the Mercury is supported by the surface of VVater on
which it rests, it cannot by any means burden the ballance
with its weight; and seing it actually presseth up the
Tub, (according to the seventh consideration) it must so
much the more counterpoise (according to the sixth) the
opposite Pressure of the VVater B C, and consequently
diminish the weight of it: so that the Ballance cannot sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the whole, but a part. For according to what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of force, the Mercury presseth up the Tub with, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the same, must the Pressure upon the top of the
Tub be diminished, and so if the Mercury press up the Tub
with the force of 27 ounce, the VVater B C must press
it down with 14 ounce only, and so the Cylinder B C,
that weighs really 41 ounce, must press the top of this
Tub only with 14, which 14 ounce really counterpoiseth,
the 14 ounce of Stone in the Scale L. But how is it made
out, that the Mercury A B, presseth up with 27 ounce?
For understanding this, remember, that the VVater is 49
foot high, taking in the Pressure of the Air, and that a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106992:62"/>
VVater of that deepness is able to support 41 inches of
Mercury, every inch weighing one ounce. For if 14 of
Water, be able to support one of Mercury, 49 foot, or
567 inches, must support 41. If then, the part of the
surface A, be able to weigh 41, it must have of upward
Pressure 27 ounces, seing it's counterpoised <hi>de facto</hi> only
with 14. Take notice, that in the <hi>Hydrostaticks,</hi> the
word <hi>pressing,</hi> or <hi>weighing,</hi> as really and truly signifies a
weighing up, as a weighing down, seing it is no less essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to Fluid Bodies to move upward, than downward, and
that with equal force, and weight. According to this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,
the Ballance supports 28 ounces of the Water E F,
(Imagine the second Tub to be suspended as the first) seing
the Cylinder of Mercury D E, presseth up the Tub only
with the weight of 12 ounce, which 28 ounce, really
counterpoiseth the 28 ounce of Stone in the Scale L. But
why doth the Mercury A B press up with 27 ounce, and
the Mercury D E with 12? For answer, remember, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the sixth consideration) the shorter a Cylinder
of Mercury is, the surface upon which it rests, is the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and more able to press it up; and contrariwise, the
longer it is, the surface is the more unable and weak:
therefore. A B being shorter, and lighter than D E, the
surface of Water must press it up with greater force: so that
if the said surface A M, be able to press up the Mercury
A B with 27 ounce, it must press up the Mercury D E
only with 12 ounce. According to this rule, if the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
A B were 15 inches high, it would press up only with
26 ounce, if it were 16, with 25: if 17, with 24: if
18, with 23, and so forward. This leads us to a clear dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of all the secrets here: for if the Mercury A B,
thrust up the Pipe, with the weight of 27 ounce, then
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106992:62"/>
must the Scale K, be eased of so much weight, and so much
must be subtracted from L. Now let us imagine the Pipe
A B, to be empty both of Air, Water, and Mercury:
in this case 41 ounce must be in the Scale L, to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poise
it, seing the whole Cylinder B C, that weighs so
much, does now really counterpoise it. Let us imagine
next, these 14 inches of Mercury to rise, and fill the Tub
A B: in this case, there happens a great alteration; because
the rising of them, are really equivalent to the subtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of 27 ounce from the Scale L; and the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by so rising and filling the Tub, they thrust up the
said Tub, and by this means easeth the Scale K, of so much
weight. Now this Scale being eased, you must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
take out from L 27 ounce for making a new coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise.</p>
               <p>And lastly, the Scale K must support the whole weight
of the Water H I, which is 39 ounce, nothing remaining
to counterballance this downward Pressure, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ease the Ballance. How then is it counterpoised?
For clearing this, you must remember that this Water,
that's really 15 foot deep, must be reckoned (as I said)
49, because of the Pressure of the Air upon the top, that's
equivalent to 34. If then it be so, it cannot raise Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
higher in a Tub than 42 inches; the one being 14
times heavier than the other: so that if 14 inches of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
cannot raise Mercury higher than one inch, 49 foot
cannot raise it higher, than 42 inches: for as 14 inches, are
to one inch; so is 49 foot to three foot and an half, which
is 42 inches. Now I say, the whole weight of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
H I, rests upon the top of the Tub, and so presseth
down the Scale K, to which you must imagine this Tub,
knit by a string, as the former was, nothing remaining to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106992:63"/>
counterpoise this downward Pressure: for the top of the
Mercurial Cylinder being raised as high within the Pipe, as
the surface of Water D G S, is able to raise it, the said
top can impress no force upon the Tub within, to thrust it
up, and so to ease the Scale K. For example, when a man
erects upon his hand a Cylinder of Timber, or any such
like thing, which is the outmost he can support, he will
not be able to impress any impulse, upon the seiling of a
room above his head; but if so be, in stead of that taken
away, there be one lighter erected, which he is able to
command, he can easily thrust up the seiling at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
Just so it is here; for the 42 inches of Mercury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the outmost, that the surface of Water D G S is able
to bear, it cannot impress any impulse therewith upon the
top of the Tub within: but easily can the Cylinder D E
impress an impulse, and more easily the Cylinder A B,
seing they are lighter, and so more powerful. To evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
this a little more, let us imagine two things, first,
the Tub G H to be empty, as if <hi>vacuity</hi> were in it. In
this case the top of the Tub ought to bear the whole bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of the Water, and consequently the Ballance to bear
it also: because there is not a <hi>potentia</hi> within the Tub, to
counterpoise this <hi>pondus.</hi> Next, let us imagine the Tub
to be only full of Water: according to this supposition,
the Ballance cannot be in the least part burdened; because
the Water within the Pipe, presseth it up with as much
force, as the Water I H presseth it down: and if any
thing should burden the Ballance, it would be only the
weight of the Pipe, that's not considerable.</p>
               <p>From what is demonstrated, we see first, that though
this Experiment would seem to prove at the first, that a
heavy Body weighs as much in the Water, as it doth in the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106992:63"/>
Air, because the whole weight of the Mercury A B is
found in the scale L, yet 'tis not so, because the 14 ounce of
Stone L, doth not counterpoise any of the Mercury A B, but
14 ounce of the Pillar of Water B C. Secondly, there's here a
clear ground, for asserting a <hi>pondus</hi> and a <hi>potentia</hi> in Fluids;
because this Tub A B, is prest down with the VVater B C,
and prest up with the Mercury within it. Thirdly, there's
here a clear ground for asserting the Pressure of VVater,
even in its own place; because the Water B C, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poises
by it's weight, the 14 ounce of Stone L. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we see an excellent way for finding the weight of any
Cylinder of Water; for whatever be the weight of the
Mercury in the Tub, the Cylinder of Water, that rests up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the top, will be of the same weight exactly; this is
evident in comparing the weight of the Mercury G H,
with the weight of the Water H I. Fifthly, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
be the height, and weight of a Pillar of Water, yet
the Ballance can sustain no more of it, than the just weight
of the Mercury: this is also evident, because the scale of
the Ballance, supports no more of the weight of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
B C, than the just weight of the Mercury A B. We
see sixthly, the further down a Pipe with Mercury goes
through Water, the greater is the Pressure it makes upon
the top of the Tub within: for put the case, this were
100 foot deep, the Mercury G H, that wants all upward
Pressure now, would press up the Tub with 40 ounce: the
Mercury D E with 55, and the Mercury A B with 70.
We see seventhly, the shorter a Cylinder of Mercury be,
it is the stronger in pressing; and longer it be, it is the
weaker; for there's more strength in A B, than in D E.
We see eighthly, that the strength decayes, and grows, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Arithmetical progression,</hi> as 1, 2, 3, 4; because
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106992:64"/>
if you make the Cylinder G H 41, that's now 42, it
presseth up with one ounce. Make it 40 inches, it will press
up with two ounces of weight. Make it 39, it presseth up
with three. And contrariwise, make the Cylinder D E 29
inches, that's now but 28, it will press up with 11 ounce
only. (VVith 28 it presseth up with 12.) Make it 30
inches high, it will press up with 10. If it be 31 inches,
it presseth up with nine, and so forward. Lastly, make the
Cylinder A B 15 inches, that's now but 14, it presseth up
with 26 (with 14, it presseth up with 27) make it 16,
it presseth up with 25; make it 17, it presseth up with
24. We see ninthly, that in Fluids, we may make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
between a <hi>sustentation,</hi> and an <hi>equipondium.</hi> 'Tis
evident here, because there's a perfect <hi>equipondium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the 42 inches of Mercury G H, and the outward
Water that's 49 foot deep. But 'tis not so, between the
said Water, and the Mercury D E; because the said Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is able to raise the said Mercury 14 inches higher:
therefore the Water only <hi>sustains</hi> the Mercury D E, but
<hi>counterballances</hi> the Mercury G H. We see tenthly, that
the <hi>pondus</hi> of the pillar of Water B C is counterpoised by
two distinct <hi>powers</hi> really. The one is the 14 ounce of
Stone in the scale L, the other is the 14 inches of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
A B, that as really thrusts up the Water, as the scale
K pulls it up, by vertue of the opposite weight. Eleventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
take away the Stone L, and you will find the Pipe with
the Mercury A B sink down: this happens, not because
the surface of Water on which it rests is not able to sustain
it, but because the 14 ounce of the Water B C, that was
supported by the Stone, doth now press it down. Twelfth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the more a Body is unequally pressed by a Fluid, the
more of the weight of that Fluid is sensible; and the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106992:64"/>
more equally a Body is pressed, the less sensible is the
weight of that Fluid: this is evident, because there's a
greater weight of the VVater H I found in the Ballance
(it takes 42 ounce to counterpoise it) than of the VVater
E F, which is counterpoised with 28 ounce: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because the top of the Tub H, supports the whole
39 ounce of VVater H I, the Mercury within the Tub,
not being able in the least to counterpoise it, or thrust it
up. But because the Tub D E, is more equally pressed
(the VVater E F presseth down with 40, and the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
D E presseth up with 12) therefore less weight of the
VVater E F burdens the Ballance, only 28 ounce. Hence
it is, that because the Tub A B, is more equally pressed,
than either D E or G H, there's less of the weight of the
VVater B C, found in the Ballance, only 14 ounce. Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenthly,
if in the instant of time, while the Tubs are
thus suspended in the VVater, the Pressure of the Air
above were taken away, and <hi>annihilated;</hi> then first, the 42
inches of Mercury G H would fall down, to about 13
inches. Secondly, the 28 inches of Mercury D E, would
fall down to as many. And lastly, the 14 A B, would
sink down to the same height. The reason is, because the
Pressure of the Air being equivalent to 34 foot of VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
no more would remain but 15 foot, which is the real
height, according to Z M. But 15 foot of Water, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
sustain moe inches of Mercury than about 13. And
consequently, first, 14 ounce of Stone in the Ballance,
would counterpoise the whole Water B C. The reason
is, because the Water B C is but of 14 ounce; and the
Mercury A B, being but 13 inches high, could impress no
impulse upon the top of the Tub within, that's 14 inches
high. Secondly, 13 ounce of Stone in the Scale L, would
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106992:65"/>
counterpoise the whole Water E F, seing E F is but 13
ounce. Thirdly, the same weight (one ounce being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced)
would counterpoise the Water H I, because in this
case, it weighs but 12 ounce,</p>
               <p>To proceed a little further, imagine the Pipe G H to
be suspended by the ballance, as the Pipe A B is; and
then a little hole opened in the top H, to suffer the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to come in, till the Mercury subside 14 inches, namely
from Q to O (imagine this Tub to be the other) and
then stop it. The reason why the VVater rusheth in, and
presseth down the Mercury, is the force and Pressure of it:
for the said VVater, finding the Cylinder in <hi>equilibrio</hi> with
the outward VVater, presently by its own weight, casts
the scales, which is easily done, seeing the surface G S M
supports as much burden as it can. But that which is more
considerable is this; after the subsiding of the Mercury
from Q to O; the <hi>equilibrium</hi> that was between the scale
of the ballance, and the VVater Q R is destroyed: for
whereas 42 ounces were required before; 29 will now do
it. For understanding the reason of this, consider that
between Q and O, are 14 inches of VVater rushed in,
which are equivalent to one inch of Mercury. Next, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to former reasonings, the ballance must support 29
ounces of the VVater Q R; because in this case, the top
of the Pipe within, is pressed up with the weight of 13
ounces; which in effect, diminisheth as much of the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Pressure of the VVater R Q, which before had the
burden of 39 ounces. But why is the Tub prest up with
13 ounces? I answer, because the Mercury, that before was
42 inches, is now but 28, or having the 14 inches of Water
Q O above it, it is 29, therefore being shorter, the surface
G S M is the more able to Press it up, even with as much
more force, as it is in inches shorter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:106992:65"/>
In the second place, let in as much Water more, as will
depress the Mercury other 14 inches, namely from O to P.
In this case, 16 ounce of stone will make an <hi>equipondium;</hi>
because, the 14 inches of Mercury P S, and the 28 inches
of Water P O Q, being a far lighter burden by 26, than
the 42 inches of Mercury, the surface G S M must be far
abler to press them up now, than before: and therefore, must
diminish as much of the downward Pressure of the VVater
Q R, that burdens the Ballance, as themselves wants of
weight: seing then, the whole Cylinder of Mercury, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
together, are but equivalent for weight to 16 inches of
Mercury, the top of the Tub within, must be prest up with
26 ounce; and therefore they by their upward Pressure,
must diminish 26 ounce of the weight of the Water R Q,
that weighs 39. Lastly, let in so much VVater, as will
depress the last 14 inches P S; and you will find no more
weight required in the Ballance to make an <hi>equipondium,</hi>
than counterpoiseth the simple weight of the Tub, which
is not considerable. The reason is, because, the part S, of
the surface G S M, being liberated of the burden of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
and sustaining only the VVater within the Tub, in
stead of it, this surface presseth up the VVater within the
Tub, and consequently the top of it, with as great force,
and weight, as the top of the Tub without is depressed,
with the outward VVater R Q: therefore, 39 ounce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
the Tub, and 39 ounce pressing it up, the Ballance
must be freed of the whole weight of VVater R Q. If it
be objected, that the 42 inches of VVater Q S, are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
in weight to three inches of Mercury; therefore the
part of the surface S, being burdened with this, cannot
press up, with as great force, as the VVater R Q presseth
down. For answer, consider, that the part S, is able to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106992:66"/>
support 42 ounce of VVater, and next, that the VVater
R Q weighs but 39. Then I say, seing the 42 inches of
VVater within the Tub, weighs only three ounce, the
part S, that's burdened therewith, being able to support 42,
it must press up with the weight of 39, and so counterbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
the VVater R Q.</p>
               <p>If it be in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Mercury A B fall down, a small hole being made in the

that these 14 inches of Mercury, are not in <hi>equilibri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with the Pressure of the ambient Water, as the Mercury
G H, and therefore they cannot be so easily depressed by the
Water, that comes in at the said hole. I answer, they must
all fall down, and as easily, as the other, and that because of
inequality of weight between the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the surface of
VVater, and the <hi>Pondus.</hi> It's certain, the part A of the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
cannot support more weight of any kind, than 42
ounce; but when a hole is opened in B, and the VVater
co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es in, 'tis then burdened with the weight of 14 ounce
of Mercury, and with the weight of 41 ounce of VVater;
so much the VVater B C weighs, which is 55 ounce: but
a surface that hath only the <hi>Potentia</hi> of 42, can never sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
a <hi>Pondus</hi> of 55, no not of 43.</p>
               <p>It may be objected thus: Put the case a Cylinder of
Gold, or Brass were suspended in this VVater; as the
Pipe and Mercury G H are suspended by the Ballance,
would not the Ballance support the whole weight of it,
without supporting any part of the weight of the VVater
I H, that rests upon the top of it. I answer, there's a
great difference between the two; because a Cylinder of
Gold or Brass, suffers both the upward and downward
Pressure of the VVater; but the Mercury G H, suffers
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:106992:66"/>
only the upward Pressure, being freed of the downward,
by the top of the Tub. From this Experiment of letting
in the VVater upon the top of the Mercury, we see first,
that when two Fluids are in <hi>equilibrio</hi> one with another,
a very small weight will cast and turn the Scales, because, if
the sixth part of an inch of VVater come in at Q, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
alters the hight of the Mercury from 42 inches to
less. Secondly, 'tis impossible for a surface of Water, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
more weight, than its own proper burden; because the
part S, cannot support more, no not a grain, than 42 ounce.
VVe see thirdly, that it is as impossible for a surface of
VVater, to support less, than its own burden; because
whatever loss of weight the Pillar of Mercury S Q suffers,
by the ingress of the VVater Q O, its made up again by
the same VVater. If it be objected, that the 14 inches of
VVater Q O, are not so heavy by far, as the 14 inches of
Mercury, that fell down. I answer, its true, yet the part
S, is as much burdened as before, because what is wanting
in weight, its made up, and compensed by Pressure. VVe
see fourthly, that the <hi>Pressure</hi> of a Fluid is a thing really
distinct from the <hi>natural weight,</hi> according to the 22 The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orem:
because though the 14 inches of Water Q O, are
not so heavy naturally as the 14 inches of Mercury that fell
down, yet the Pressure of them upon the surface S, is as
much. We see fifthly, that 14 inches of Water, that's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
body fourteen times lighter than Mercury, may have as
much weight with them, as 14 ounce of Mercury. We see
sixthly, that a Cylinder of Mercury cannot be suspended in
Air, or in Water unless it be guarded with a Tub, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it from the downward Pressure of that Air or Water:
for by opening an hole in Q, the Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cury subsides. We

                  </gap> Fluids to suspend
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106992:67"/>
one another mutually, unless there be a sort of <hi>equipondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
between them; because no sooner you destroy the
<hi>equipondium,</hi> between the 42 inches of Mercury Q S, and
the part of the surface S, by the ingress of the Water Q O,
but assoon there ariseth a new one. We see eighthly (as
we noted before) the nearer a Body comes to be equally
pressed with a Fluid, the less is the Pressure of that Fluid
<hi>sensible:</hi> because less weight is required in the Ballance,
to counterpoise the Pressure, and weight of the Water
R Q, after the ingress of the Water Q O P, than after the
ingress of the Water Q O. We see ninthly, that when
a Body is equally, and uniformly pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed with a Fluid, the
Pressure is <hi>insensible;</hi> because, after the Water hath thrust
down all the Mercury from Q to S, there's no more weight
at all of the Water R Q found in the Ballance. We see
tenthly, that not only in Water, the Pressure of Water
may be found, but out of it, namely in the Air; as is clear
from the Ballance, that supports the Pressure of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
R Q. We see eleventhly, a ground to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>natural Ballance,</hi> and the <hi>artificial Ballance.</hi> The
<hi>artificial Ballance,</hi> is the Ballance K L: the <hi>natural,</hi> is the
Pipe Q S. We see twelfthly, that they keep a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
between themselves, or some <hi>Analogy:</hi> for by
what proportion the Water thrusts down the Mercury, by
that same proportion the <hi>pondus</hi> L, of the Ballance is les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened:
and by what proportion the Mercury rises in the
Pipe, by that same, is the weight L augmented in the Scale.
We may subjoyn lastly, that the easiest way of explicating
the <hi>Phenomena</hi> of Nature, is not always the best, and truest.
For some may think, it were far easier to say, that the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
supports the Mercury A B, or D E, and not any part of
the Water B C, or E F. But such a way would be false, and
absurd, and contrary to all the former Doctrine.</p>

               <p>THis Schematism represents a Water 100 foot deep,
whose first and visible surface is I H K. And L M
is the ground of it. C D is a piece of <hi>brass</hi> 30 inches
high, and 12 inches in diameter, suspended upon the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
surface of Water A N B, which is distant from the
top I H K, 25 foot. This <hi>Brass</hi> cannot go farder down,
when demitted from H; because it's keeped up, by the
Force and Pressure of the surface of Water A N B, which
I prove thus. The part B sustains <hi>de facto,</hi> a Pillar of
Water K B 1400 pound weight: therefore the part
N is able to sustain as much. I suppose here, the said
piece of <hi>Brass</hi> to weigh 1400 pound. The Water K B
is 1400 pound, because its a Pillar 25 foot high, and 12
inches thick, for one cubical foot weighs 56 pound Trois.
The <hi>connexion</hi> of the argument is evident, because it is as
easie for a surface of Water, to sustain a solid Body, as to
sustain a Fluid Body: therefore, if the part B, support
the Fluid Pillar K B, the part N must be able to support
likewise the solid Pillar C D, which is of the same weight.

                  </gap> it be objected, that the part N, sustains besides the <hi>Brass</hi>
C D, a Pillar of Water E F 22 foot high, and a half,
which two will weigh 2260 pound. I answer, upon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
that neither Water nor Air succeeded, the space
E F being void of both, the <hi>Brass</hi> would be suspended
with the force and power of the Water N. And though
this cannot be made <hi>practicable,</hi> yet the <hi>Theory</hi> of it may
conduce much for explicating the secrets and mysteries of
the <hi>Hydrostaticks.</hi> But why ought the <hi>Brass</hi> to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106992:68"/>
at 25 foot from the top? I answer, because the
<hi>potentia</hi> of the surface A N B, is equal to the <hi>pondus</hi> of
the <hi>Brass.</hi> To evidence this, consider that <hi>Brass</hi> is a Body
<hi>naturally</hi> heavier then Water, I shall suppose ten times,
that's to say, one inch of <hi>Brass</hi> will counterpoise ten inches
of Water. If this inequality be, then must this Pillar of
<hi>Brass</hi> go so much farder down, than the first surface I H K,
as the one is heavier <hi>in specie,</hi> or <hi>naturally,</hi> than the other:
therefore it must sink 25 foot exactly; seing a piece of
<hi>Brass</hi> 30 inches high, requires 400 inches of Water, or 25
foot to counterpoise it: for if one inch of <hi>Brass</hi> require
ten inches of Water, then surely 30 inches must require
300. Yet it is no matter, what the thickness be, provided
it be no higher than 30 inches.</p>
               <p>To advance some farder, let us make a second supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
namely, while the <hi>Brass</hi> is thus suspended upon the
surface A N B, suppose the Air to come down, and fill up
the imaginary space E F, then must the <hi>Brass</hi> be thrust
down as far as the surface O P, that's 34 foot below the
surface A N D, and 59 from the top. The reason of it
is this, because the weight of the Air superadded, is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to the Pressure of a Pillar of Mercury 29 inches high,
and 12 inches thick: therefore the <hi>Brass</hi> being burdened
with this, it must go so farder down, till it meet with a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
whose <hi>potentia</hi> is equal in weight, to the <hi>pondus</hi> of both,
which is precisely 59 foot from the top: for if one inch of
Mercury require 14 of Water, then 29 inches must require
405 inches, or 34 foot. In a word, it must go as far down,
as that surface, that sustains a Pillar of Water, that would
counterpoise in a Ballance, the <hi>Brass</hi> C D, and a Pillar of
Mercury 29 inches high, and 12 inches thick, both which
weighs 3290 pound.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:106992:68"/>
From what is said, we see first, that of two heavy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
differing in weight, the lighter may go further down
than the heavier. This is clear, because a slender <hi>Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of <hi>Gold,</hi> in form of an Arrow, half an inch thick, and
28 inches long, weighing 28 pound ('tis no matter, though
the just weight of it be not determined) will go down 35
foot in Water, before it meet with a surface, whose <hi>poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
is equal in weight to its own <hi>pondus;</hi> for if <hi>Gold</hi> be 15
times heavier <hi>naturally</hi> than Water, then the said Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
must go down before it rest, 420 inches, or 35 foot.
But a piece of <hi>Gold</hi> 12 inches long, and six inches thick,
that perhaps will weigh 208 pound, will sink no further
than 15 foot. And the reason is, because, if one inch of
Gold require 15 of VVater to counterpoise it, then 12 must
only require 180, or 15 foot. Note, that both the bodies
must go down <hi>Perpendicularly,</hi> and not as it were <hi>Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontally,</hi>
with their sides downmost: for if they go
down after this manner, they cannot sink so far. The
reason of this is also evident, because a heavy body
goes so far down, and no further, till it hath thrust <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
much Water out of its place, as will counterpoise it self in
a Ballance. That's to say, if an heavy body weigh 100
pound, it must go no further down, than after it hath
thrust out 100 pound of Water. But so it is, that a piece
of Gold, in form of an Arrow, going down <hi>side-wise,</hi> or
with the two ends parallel to the Horizon, will thrust as
much Water out of its place, as will be the weight of it
self, before it can go down 15 or 16 inches from the top:
because for every inch it goes down side-wise, it expell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 28
inches of Water. In going down two inches, it expells 56.
In going down three inches, it expells 84, and so forward,
till it go down 15 inches, where it expells 420 inches:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:106992:69"/>
but 420 inches amounts to 35 foot. Now, take a Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Water 35 foot high, and just the thickness of the
Cylinder of Gold, which I supposed to be of half an inch,
and put them in a ballance, and you will find the one just
the weight of the other. Neither can the piece of Gold
go so far down as before, if it go down <hi>side-wise;</hi> because
for every six inches it is drowned, it expells a bulk of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
12 inches long, and six inches thick; therefore it must
be suspended, before it go beyond 90 inches, or seven foot
and an half: now, if six inches give one foot, 90 inches will
give 15 foot: but 15 of Water in hight, and six inches
thick, is the just weight of it in a ballance, <hi>viz.</hi> 208 pound.
We see secondly, the broader and larger the surface of a
Fluid be, 'tis the more able and strong to support an heavy
burden: therefore the part of a surface of Water six inches
square every way, will carry a far greater weight, than a
part four inches square. Though a surface of Water 34
or 35 foot deep, be not able to sustain a Cylinder of <hi>Gold.</hi>
if it exceed 28 or 29 inches in hight, yet take a Cylinder
of <hi>Gold,</hi> 10 foot high, and reduce it, by making it thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
to the hight of 20 inches, a surface of Water little more
than 24 foot deep will sustain it. Or reduce a Cylinder
10 foot high, which requires a surface more than 100 foot
deep, to a Cylinder six inches high, a surface little more
than seven foot deep will support it. We see thirdly, the
reason why bodies that are broad and large, move <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lowlier
through Air and VVater, than bodies that are more thin,
and slender, though both be of the same weight in a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance.
For example, 20 pound of Lead, long and slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
like an Arrow, will go sooner to the ground of a deep
VVater, than a piece of Lead of the same weight, in form
of a Platter or Bason. The reason is, because as the body
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:106992:69"/>
is broader, so it takes a broader part of a surface, which
broader part is stronger and abler, than a narrower part, and
so makes the greater resistance. The same is the reason,
why a Bullet six inches in Diameter, moves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lowlier tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the Air, shot from a Cannon, than a Bullet one inch
in Diameter. For the same reason, Ships of seven or eight
hundred Tun, move far slowlier thorow the Air, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
than Vessels of less burden. Item, large and big
Fowls, as Eagles, move slowlier, than small Birds, as
Swallows. Yea, of Fowls of the same quantity, one may
move quicklier than another, as is evident in long-wing'd
<hi>Hawks,</hi> as <hi>Falcons,</hi> that by the sharpness of their Wings,
move far more space in half an hour, than Kites, or Gose-Hawks,
whose wings are rounder. We see fourthly, that
there's no body how heavy soever, but it may be support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the surface of a Fluid, either in Air or in VVater.
I grant, the strongest surface of Air, that can be had, is
not able to support more weight, than a Cylinder of <hi>Gold</hi>
28 inches high: yet though it were as large, and broad, as
a <hi>Mill-stone,</hi> if it do not exceed the said hight, the Air is
able to sustain it. For the same cause, if it were possible
to free a <hi>Mill-stone</hi> of the Air, that rests upon it, the Air
below would lift it from the ground, and carry it up many
fathoms, even till it came to a surface, equal in power to
the weight of the Stone. Or, if a large <hi>Mill-stone</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
from the top of the <hi>Atmosphere,</hi> towards the <hi>Earth,</hi>
it could hardly touch the ground, being detained by the
way, by a surface counterpoising it. Or if it did touch,
through the swiftness of the motion, it would surely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as it were, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rebound, and be carried up again. It is
alwayes to be remembred, that in such trials, the Air is
supposed not to follow, or to be united, after the Stone
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:106992:70"/>
passeth thorow. Now if the Air be able to do this, far
more the VVater, that's a body a thousand times heavier.
We see fifthly the reason, why heavy bodies move so
easily thorow Air, and Water, namely because the parts
that were divided, by the body that is moved, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
reunited, and closed again, by which means it is
driven forward, the Pressure upon the back, being as much
as the Pressure before. If this were not, no body what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
would be able to move it self one foot forward.
For example, if, when a man hath advanced one step for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
the Air did not close again upon his back, the force
of the Air upon his belly and breast, would not only stop
him, but violently thrust him backward. We see sixthly,
the reason, why the same body descends with more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
thorow Water, than Air, because a surface of Water
is far stronger, than a surface of Air. We see seventhly,
that a heavy body is never suspended by a surface of
Water, or Air, in going down, till once it hath displaced,
as much Water or Air, as will counterpoise it self in a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance.
This is clear from the <hi>Brass</hi> C D, that goes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
down, till it expell its own weight of Water. For
this cause, if a <hi>Mill-stone</hi> were demitted, or sent down
from the top of the Air, and never rested, till it came
within 40 fathom of the <hi>Earth,</hi> then so much Air, as is
expelled by the descent, is the just weight of the stone.
We see eighthly, the heavier a body be <hi>naturally,</hi> than Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it goes the further down, and the lighter it is, it sinks
the less. For if C D were of Gold, it would go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
down, than being of Brass or Iron: and if C D were
a stone, that's lighter <hi>in specie</hi> than Brass, it would not go
so far down. This lets us know the reason, why thicker,
blacker, and heavier clouds comes nearer to the <hi>Earth,</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:106992:70"/>
than thinner, whiter, and lighter. VVe see ninthly, that
the Pressure of the Air is determinable, even in its heighest
degree, and seemes to be the same in all places of the
world; but the Pressure of the Water is not so. The
reason of the first part is, because the Element of Air seems
to be of the same hight in all places, and therefore we
may know its outmost Pressure, which is just equivalent to
the weight of 28 or 29 inches of Gold, or Mercury. But
because the deepness of the Sea is variable, therefore the
Pressure is variable likewise. Yet if the exact deepness,
of the deepest place were known, it were as easie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the greatest Pressure of it, as to determine the
greatest Pressure of the Air. We see tenthly, that a very
small weight added or subtracted in height, will change
and alter the counterpoise of a Fluid. Because if you lay
but one ounce upon the top of the <hi>brass</hi> at F, it presently
subsides accordingly: or take one ounce from it, and it rises.
But though never so much weight be added to it, or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
from it in thickness, no alteration follows. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though this piece of <hi>Brass</hi> C D, that's now but 12
inches in thickness, were made 24, by which means the
weight would be tripled and more, yet the same surface A
N B would sustain it: yet, add to it in altitude, but one
inch, and presently it sinks down proportionably. This
evidently discovers the reason, why its as easie for the Air,
to support a Cylinder of Mercury 3 inches thick, as to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
a Cylinder half an inch thick: and why it cannot sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
more in height than 29 inches, and why it cannot sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
less. Now the reason, why a thicker Pillar, is as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suspended, as a thinner, is this, because if a Pillar of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
be thicker, and consequently heavier, than it takes a
broader, and consequently a stronger surface of Air to rest
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106992:71"/>
upon: if it be but slender, and so but light, then it takes a
lesser part of a surface to bear it up, and consequently a
weaker; by which means the <hi>Pondus</hi> of the one, is alwayes
proportionable to the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the other. Is it not as
easie for a Pillar of stone, 6 foot in Diameter, to support
another six foot in Diameter; as it is for a Pillar one foot
in Diameter, to support a Pillar one foot in Diameter?
But as a Pillar one foot in Diameter, cannot support a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
6 foot in Diameter, neither can a surface of Air, one
inch in Diameter, support a Pillar of Mercury 6 inches in
Diameter. But why should a larger part of a surface be
stronger than a narrower part? I answer, the one is stronger
than the other, for that same reason, why a thicker Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is heavier than a thinner: for what I call <hi>strength</hi> in a
surface, its nothing else but <hi>weight,</hi> and what I call <hi>weight</hi>
in a Cylinder, its nothing else but <hi>strength.</hi> The same
thing hath two names; because the pillar of a Fluid presseth
down, and the surface supports: therefore, in the one its
called <hi>pondus,</hi> in the other <hi>potentia.</hi> As when two scales
are in <hi>equilibrio,</hi> either this, or that may be called the <hi>pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus;</hi>
or either this, or that, may be called the <hi>potentia.</hi>
Now I say, if a part of a surface four inches broad, have as
much weight or force in it, as a Pillar of Mercury four
inches thick; then surely, a part of a surface eight inches
broad, must have as much weight and force in it, as a Pillar
of Mercury eight inches thick. But why ought a surface to
succumb, when the Pillar grows in hight, and not to fail
when it grows only in breadth? <hi>Ans.</hi> VVhen it grows in
breadth, the <hi>pondus</hi> never exceeds the <hi>potentia;</hi> but when
it becomes higher, then it becomes heavier. That's to
say, when a Pillar grows broader, there's not one part of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he surface that sustains it, more burdened than another;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106992:71"/>
seing the part eight inches broad, is no more prest with a
Pillar eight inches thick; than the part four inches broad,
is prest with a Pillar four inches thick: as eight ounce of
Lead in this Scale, is no more counterpoised with eight
ounce in the other Scale, than four ounce in this Scale, is
counterpoised with four in the other. But when a Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
grows in hight, the <hi>pondus</hi> exceeds the <hi>potentia;</hi> one
part of a surface being more burdened than another. We
see eleventhly, that in a large surface of a Fluid, wherein
are many parts; each part is able to sustain its own proper
burden. So a part eight inches in Diameter supports a
Pillar eight inches thick; and a part four inches, supports
a Cylinder four inches thick; but cannot support a Pillar
six inches thick. But this seems rather to flow from the
<hi>disproportion</hi> of <hi>Magnitudes,</hi> seing a circular plain 4 inches
in diameter, cannot receive a Base of a Pillar 6 inches in dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter.
But this is certain from the very nature of Fluids,
that in a deep VVater, wherein may be distinguished 100,
or 1000 different surfaces, each one is able to support his
own burden, and no more.</p>

               <head>EXPERIMENT XIII.
Figure 17, 18, 19.</head>
               <p>FOr making this Experiment, take two <hi>plain</hi> Bodies of
Brass, or Marble well polished. Make them of any
quantity; but for this present use, let each of them be four
inches broad square-wise. Upon the back part, let each
one have an handle about six inches long, of the same metal,
formed with the <hi>plain</hi> it self, in the founding (if they be
of Brass) as is represented in this Schematism. When
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106992:72"/>
they are thus prepared, anoint their inner-sides with Oyl
or Water, and having thrust the one face alongst upon the
other, with all the strength you have, till all the four edges
agree, two whereof are represented by A B, and C D, you
will find them cleave so closs together, as if they were but
one Body. The effect is this, that ordinary strength will
not pull them asunder; and that under a surface of Water,
a stronger pull is required than in the Air.</p>
               <p>That we may deduce some <hi>Hydrostatical</hi> conclusions
from this Experiment, let us suppose these two <hi>plain</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to be united in the middle of the VVater I K P Q,
that's 34 foot deep, and suspended by a beam or long tree
T V existing in the Air, near the top of the VVater, by a
chord S E passing between the middle of the beam, and
the end of the handle at E. Suppose next a great weight
of Lead R, 350 pound, to be appended to the end of the
handle at H, of the under <hi>plain</hi> Body C D N O. This
done, I affirm, that the beam T V, neither sustains the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>plain</hi> Body C D N O G H, not the 350 pound
weight of Lead R, that hangs down from the handle G H.
If it be objected, that the beam supports the upper <hi>plain</hi>
Body A B L M F E; therefore it must bear the weight
also of the under <hi>plain</hi> C D N O G H, with the weight R;
seing they are both united together, and cleave so closs,
as if they were but one Body. I answer, it supports the
one unquestionably, but not the other. To explicate
this <hi>Hydrostatical</hi> Mystery, I must aver three things; first,
that the inferior <hi>plain</hi> is supported by the upward Pressure
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the lower VVater P Q N O. Secondly, that the
burden which the beam sustains, is not the weight of the
under <hi>plain,</hi> but the weight of the 34 foot of Water I K
L M. Thirdly, that this weight is exactly the weight
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:106992:72"/>
of the inferior <hi>plain,</hi> and Lead R. But is it not more
easie to say, that the beam supports both the <hi>plains?</hi> I
answer, if I say so, I can neither affirm truth, nor speak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentially,
But may it not be said, that the inferior
<hi>plain</hi> is supported both by the beam, and the lower water
P Q N O? I answer, this is impossible; because one and
the same weight, cannot be supported totally, by two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
supporters.</p>
               <p>For making these assertions evident, I must suppose the
superior Water I K L M to be 34 foot deep, and to
weigh, if it were put into a ballance, 400 pound: and which
is unquestionable, that the said Water rests upon the back
of the superior <hi>plain</hi> L M. I suppose secondly, that the
lower Water P Q N O weighs as much, and thrusts up
the inferior <hi>plain</hi> with as great weight, as the superior
<hi>plain</hi> is prest down with, by the superior Water. This
is evident from former Experiments. And lastly, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
each <hi>plain</hi> to weigh two pound, and the weight of
Lead R 350. It is to be observed here, that no mistake may
arise in the calculation afterwards, that though it be said,
this 34 foot of Water weighs 400 pound, yet in it self it
weighs but 200: but considering the Pressure of the Air
upon I K, which is as much, it may be truly said to weigh
400. These things being premitted; I say the weight that
the beam T V sustains, is not the weight of the inferior
<hi>plain,</hi> and the Lead R, but 352 pound of the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
VVater I K L M, and consequently, that the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
<hi>plain</hi> is supported by the lower VVater P Q N O.
The reason is, because the lower VVater presseth up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>th
the weight of 48 pound. It is in it self 400 pound: but
being burdened with 352, it cannot thrust up with more
weight than 48. Now, it pressing up with 48, must ease
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:106992:73"/>
the beam of 48, and counterpoise so much of the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
VVater, and consequently the beam must support
only 352 pound of it. But put the case (you say) the
weight R, were 130 pound, 160 pound, or 180 pound,
would the beam be less or more burdened with the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
Water? I answer, if R be 130 pound, then the beam
supports only 132 pound of the superior Water; for if
the inferior be only burdened with 130, the weight of R,
and with two the weight of the inferior <hi>plain,</hi> then must
it press up with 368, and by this means, must ease the beam
of so much, it sustaining 132 pound only. According to
this compting, when the Lead R weighs 160 pound, the
beam supports only 238 pound of the superior Water.
If it weigh 180 pound, it sustains 218. And if the weight
R were taken away, the beam supports no more of the
superior VVater than two pound.</p>
               <p>To proceed a little further; imagine the two <hi>Plains</hi> to
be drawn up 17 foot nearer the first surface I K, namely as
high as Z W. This done, the union breaks up, and they
presently fall asunder. The reason is, because<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
Z W is not able to support 352 pound, but only 300,
which I prove thus. If 68 foot sustain 400, then 51
foot must sustain 300. I say 68, and not 34, because as
was noted, the Pressure of the Air upon the surface I K,
is equivalent to other 34 foot: and therefore though
the deepness of this VVater, between I K and L M be but
34 foot really, yet it is 68 foot virtually, and in effect.
Imagine secondly the surface I K to subside 17 foot, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Z W. In this case the union is broken also, and the
lower <hi>Plain</hi> falls from the upper. The reason of this, is
the same with the former; because by what proportion
you diminish the high of the superior VVater, by that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:106992:73"/>
same proportion you diminish the upward Pressure of the
lower VVater. Therefore, if you subtract from the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
VVater 17 foot, that weighs 100 pound, you sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
likewise 100 pound from the inferior VVater, and
consequently, you make it press up only with 300, but
300 is not able to counterpoise 352.</p>
               <p>Let us suppose thirdly, the superior <hi>Plain,</hi> and the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
Water to be annihilated; then I say, the Pressure
and force of the under Water would thrust up the inferior
<hi>Plain</hi> and the weight R about eight foot higher then X Y
and there suspend them. The reason is, because the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
X Y, being able to sustain 400, and being burdened
only with 352, must have the weight of 48. Now
the upper <hi>Plain</hi> being taken away, and the upper Water
also, and the empty space of both remaining, the said
weight of 48 pound, must carry the under <hi>Plain</hi> as high as
is said. Let us suppose fourthly, the Pressure of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Air, that rests upon I K, to be taken away, then
must the two <hi>Plain</hi> bodies be disunited, the inferior falling
from the superior. The reason is, because in this case,
the superior Water would have but the weight of 200
pound, and consequently the inferior, would press up only
with as much: but 200 is not able to counterpoise 352.</p>
               <p>From what is said we see first, that in all Fluids there is
an upward Pressure, as well as a downward; and that the
one is alwayes of equal force to the other: because the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
<hi>Plain</hi> is pressed up with as great force, as the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
<hi>Plain</hi> is pressed down with. We see secondly, that
in Fluids, there is a <hi>Pondus</hi> and a <hi>Potentia.</hi> The <hi>Potenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
here is the inferior Water, and the <hi>Pondus</hi> is the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or.
Or, the 350 pound of Lead R, may be called the
<hi>Pondus,</hi> which counterpoiseth the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the surface
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106992:74"/>
of VVater X Y. We see thirdly, that though the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of a Fluid, be not the same thing with the natural
weight, yet it is equivalent to it: because the 352 pound
of Lead R, is sustained by the Pressure of the inferior
VVater, which could not be, unless they were virtually
the same. We see fourthly, that there may be as much
Pressure in one foot of Water, as there is weight in 100, or
in 1000 foot, or in 1000 fathom, For put the case, these
two plain bodies were suspended, 100 fathom below the
surface of the sea, and within a foot or two of the ground,
as much weight would be required to pull them asunder, as is
the weight of a Pillar of Water 100 fathom high, and 4
inches thick every way, which will be more then 3000
pound weight, besides the weight of the Air above, that
will weigh 200 pound. This could not be, unless there
were as much Pressure in the lowest foot of this Water,
that's 100 fathom deep, as there is weight in the whole
Pillar above. We see fifthly, the more the <hi>potentia</hi> of a
surface is burdened, the more sensible is the <hi>pondus:</hi>
because the heavier you make the Lead R, that burdens
the inferior Water, the more weight of the superior Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
rests upon the Beam. We see sixthly, the more <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally</hi>
a body is pressed, the more the Pressure is <hi>sensible.</hi>
For understanding this, consider that the under-face of the
superior <hi>Plain,</hi> is more and less pressed, according to the
more and less weight the Lead R is of: for put the case,
the inferior <hi>Plain</hi> were taken away, the face of the superior
<hi>Plain,</hi> would be equally prest with the back of it. But
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hen the inferior <hi>Plain</hi> is united to it, the Pressure of the
Water is kept off; by which means the back is prest more
than the face. Now, as the inferior <hi>Plain</hi> becomes hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
and heavier, by making the weight R more and more
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:106992:74"/>
weighty, the less and less is the face of the superior <hi>Plain</hi>
prest up. Hence it is, that as this inequality of Pressure
becomes greater and greater; so the weight of the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
Water, affects the Beam more and more. Or, if the
superior <hi>Plain</hi> were a sensible body, as <hi>Animals</hi> are, it
would find the back of it more and more burdened, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as the weight R, becomes heavier and heavier. We
see seventhly, that Water weighs in Water: because all
the weight the Beam supports, is the burden of the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
VVater, and not the burden of the inferior <hi>Plain,</hi> or
of the weight R. It supports the weight also of the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
<hi>Plain,</hi> but this is not considerable. This is only to be
understood, when the Pressure is unequal; for if the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Plain</hi> were as much prest up, as it's prest down, the
weight of the superior VVater would not be found by the
<hi>Beam.</hi> We see eighthly, that the higher a surface be, it
is the weaker; and the lower it be, it is the stronger: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
when the two plain bodies are pulled up, 17 foot, they
fall asunder. We see ninthly, the vanity of the common
opinion, that maintains two plain <hi>bodies</hi> to cleave closs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for fear of <hi>vacuity;</hi> and that neither <hi>Humane</hi> not
<hi>Angelick</hi> strength is able to break this union, without the
rupture and fracture of them both.</p>
               <p>It may be enquired, upon supposition, that the inferior
<hi>plain</hi> had four holes cut thorow the middle, square-wise,
as A B C D in the 18 Figure, what <hi>Phenomena</hi> would
follow? Before I answer, consider that this Figure repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
the inner face of the Brass-plate C D N O, of the
17 Figure, which as was supposed, is four inches from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
to side, and consequently contains 16 square inches. Now,
imagine the under <hi>plain</hi> C D N O, while it is united to
the uppermost, to have four square inches cutted out of it,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:106992:75"/>
as A B C D. These things being rightly conceived, and
understood, I say, when the said holes are cutted thorow;
the beam T V, that now sustains 350 pound, shall by this
means, only sustain 250 pound. To make this evident;
consider that the under <hi>plain</hi> (as was said) contains 16
square inches. Next, that the top of the inferior Water
upon which the <hi>plain</hi> rests, contains as many, and that every
inch of the Water weighs 25 pound, seing the whole, as
was supposed before, weighs 400 pound. Now, I say, the
beam must support only 250 pound of the Water I K L M;
because, these holes being made, the top of the inferior
Water comes through them, and presseth up the face of the
superior <hi>plain</hi> with 100 pound, and so easeth the beam of
so much. I affirm next, that though the inferior Water
N O P Q be in it self 400 pound, and consequently able
to support the inferior <hi>plain,</hi> with the weight R, albeit
they weighed so much, yet the said holes being cut out,
it is not able to support more burden than 300. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because of 16 parts that did actually bear up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
there are only 12 now that sustains. And every one
of these twelve, being but able to support 25 pound, it
necessarily follows, that the greatest weight they are able
to sustain, is 300 pound. I affirm thirdly, that if a fifth
hole were cut through, the under <hi>plain</hi> would fall from the
upper; because in this case, the inferior Water is not able
to support 350 pound as before, seing of 16 parts, there
are five wanting, and eleven remaining, cannot support more
weight than 275 pound. Moe questions of this kind might

                  </gap>e proposed; as first, what would come to pass, if the
the upper <hi>plain</hi> had as many holes cut through it, answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the four of the nether? Secondly, what would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
if the nether <hi>plain</hi> were intire, and four bored through
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:106992:75"/>
the upper? But I shall supersede, and leave these to be
gathered by the judicious Reader.</p>
               <p>From this Experiment we see first, that the broader and
larger a surface of a Fluid be, it's the more able to sustain a
burden, and the narrower it be, 'tis the less able. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that each part of a surface, is able to sustain so much
weight, and no more, and no less.</p>
               <p>Before I put a close to this Experiment, it will be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to answer an objection, proposed by <hi>Doctor More</hi> in his
<hi>Antidote against Atheism,</hi> against the Pressure of the Air,
which in effect militats, by parity of reason, against the
Pressure of the VVater likewise. He argues thus. If the
Air were indowed with so much Pressure, as is commonly
affirmed, then it ought to compress, squeez, or strain toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
any soft body that it environs, as, <hi>v. g. Butter.</hi> Put
the case then, there were a piece of <hi>Butter,</hi> four inches broad
every way, and one inch thick, containing 16 square
inches, upon every side; as may be represented by the
Figure 19. In this case, there is a far greater Pressure,
upon the two faces, than upon the four edges; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it ought to be comprest, and strained together, to
the thinness of a sheet of Paper. For answer, let us sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the piece of <hi>Butter,</hi> to be 30 or 40 foot below the
surface of a Water, where it ought to suffer far more Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
than above in the Air. Next, that it lies <hi>Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi>
with one face upward, and the other downward.
Thirdly, that the upper face supports a Pillar of Water
200 pound weight, and consequently, that the under face
is prest up with as much. And lastly, that every edge is
burdened with 50. It may be represented, with the hel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
of the fancy, in the 19 Figure, where A B is a piece of
<hi>Butter</hi> four inches square, and one inch thick. Only take
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:106992:76"/>
notice, that nothing here is represented to the sight, save
one of the four edges, namely A B; the other three, and
the two faces being left to the fancy: Yet, the upper face
may be represented by F H K M, and the under by N O
P Q. These things being rightly understood, it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
why the two great and heavy Pillars of Water, the
one E G I L F H K M, that presseth downward, and the
other N O P Q R S T V, that presseth upward, do not
strain together the sides of the <hi>Butter;</hi> seing the Pressure
of the Water B C, and the Pressure of the Water
D A, are far inferior to them for strength, even by as
much difference, as four exceeds one. Though this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
seem somewhat, yet it is really nothing, which
I make evident after this manner. First, I grant that
the upper face F H K M is burdened, with 200 pound,
and the nether face N O P Q with as much. Secondly,
that the edge B, is only burdened, with 50 pound, as is the
edge A. The other two edges, sustains each one, as
much. Secondly, though this be, yet I affirm the two
sides to be no more burdened, than the edges: that's
to say, the Pressure upon the sides, is equal to the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
upon the edges, which I prove thus. The Pressure
upon the part M, is equal to the Pressure upon the part K,
but the Pressure upon the edge B, is equal to the Pressure
upon the part M: therefore the Pressure upon B, is equal
to the Pressure upon K. The major Proposition is evident,
because the Pillar of Water L M, is of the same weight,
with the Pillar of Water I K. The Minor is also evident,
because, the Pillar B C, is of the same weight, with the
Pillar L M. Now, if the Pressure upon the edge B, be
equal to the Pressure upon M and K, it must be likewise
equal to the Pressure upon H and F. If this be, then the

edge of the <hi>Butter</hi> B, must be no more prest, than the side
F H K M: therefore the Water B C, can no more yeeld
to the VVater E F G H I K L M, and suffer the <hi>Butter</hi> to
be squeezed out at B, than the VVater L M, can yeeld to
the VVater E F G H I K, and suffer the <hi>Butter</hi> to be
squeezed out at M. If any man shall insist and say, that
the upper face bears the weight of four Pillars, which
weighs 400 pound; but the edge B is only burdened with
50: therefore 50 ought to yeeld to 400. I answer, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the 29 Theorem, namely, that a <hi>thicker</hi> Pillar
of a Fluid is not able to press, or move a <hi>slenderer,</hi> unless
there be an unequal Pressure, therefore the thick Pillar,
that presseth the face, cannot move the slender Pillar, that
presseth the edge: but there is here no unequal Pressure,
seing the Water X Y Z V, is of the same hight with the
four Pillars that rests upon the face of the <hi>Butter.</hi> I grant,
if the said Water were not so high, as the other is, by the
one half; then surely the <hi>Butter</hi> would be squeezed out at
B; because the shorter a Pillar be, the less Pressure is in the
surface under it; therefore, there must be less Pressure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that supposition in the Water B C, then now is.
Or put the case, the Pillar I K were shorter then G H, or
L M, the same effect would follow, namely, a squeezing
out of the <hi>Butter</hi> from K. Or, let us suppose the Pillar I
K, to be higher than G H or L M. In such a case, the
weight of the said Pillar would press through the <hi>Butter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From what is said, we shall only in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that equality of hight between Pillars of a Fluid makes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Pressure, and inequality of hight makes unequal Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
Therefore 'tis no matter, whether they be gross or
small, thick or slender, provided they be all of the
same Altitude.</p>

Figure 20.</head>
               <p>THis Schematism represents a Vessel full of Water
8 foot deep. E F is a Glass-Pipe, open at both
ends, about 9 foot high, and one inch in Diameter. A B C
D is a Vessel of Glass, or of any other metal, thorow whose
orifice above, the said Pipe comes down. B H I is a Pipe
going out from the said Vessel, crooked with a right angle
at H, that the orifice I may look upwards. That some
<hi>Hydrostatical</hi> conclusions may be inferred from this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
fill the lower Vessel A B C D with Quick-silver
almost; then pour in as much Water above it, as will
fill the space A B H, leaving from H to I full of Air.
Next, thrust down the orifice of the Pipe E, below the
said Water and Mercury, till it rest upon the bottom C D.
Lastly, stop well with cement the passage of the lower
Vessel, through which the Pipe came down, that neither
Air nor Water may go out, or come in. These things
being done, let down this <hi>Engine</hi> to the bottom of the
large Vessel, which, as was noted, is full of VVater from
M N to K L, 8 foot, and you will find the Mercury
to rise in the Pipe from A B to G, 6 inches, and more.
The reason is, because there is a Pillar of VVater K I, that
enters the orifice I, and presseth down the Air, from I to
P, 3 inches, which before was 6. This Air being so bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened;
instantly presseth forward the VVater H B A:
and this pressing the surface of the stagnant Mercury A B,
causes the liquor run up the Pipe from A B to G, 6 inches:
The reason, why it riseth 6 inches, is this: between the
surface of the stagnant Mercury A B, and the top of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:106992:79"/>
Water L O K, are 84 inches. Now Water being 14
times <hi>naturally</hi> lighter then Mercury, there must be 14
inches of Water, required for sustaining one inch of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
and consequently 84, for supporting 6. For a
second trial, lift up the whole <hi>Engine</hi> to the top of the
Water, and you will find the 6 inches of Mercury B G
sink down, and become no higher within the Pipe, than
the surface of the stagnant Mercury A B without. The
reason is, because by coming up above the Water, the
Pressure of the Water K I, is taken away from the orifice
I, by which means the comprest Air H P, extending it
self to I, liberats the Water A B H of the Pressure it had,
and this freeth the Mercury of its Pressure, and so the 6
inches falls down. For a third trial, stop closely the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
I, and let all down as before. In this case, you
will find no ascent of Mercury from B to G: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Water K I cannot have access to thrust
down the Air from I to P, as formerly.</p>
               <p>For a fourth, open the said orifice I, while the <hi>Engine</hi> is
below the Water, and you will find the Mercury rise from
B to G: because the Pillar of Water K I, hath now access
to press. For a fifth trial, stop the orifice I, and bring up
all to the top, and you will find the six inches of Mercury
B G suspended, as if the <hi>Engine</hi> were under the Water.
The reason is, because the stopping of the orifice, keeps the
inclosed Air P H, under the same degree of Pressure it
obtained from the Water K I. For a sixth proof, open
the same orifice I, while the <hi>Engine</hi> is above the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and you will find the six inches of Mercury fall down,
because the imprisoned Air H P, obtains now its liberty;
and expanding it self from H to I, eases the Water B H
of the burden it was under. For a seventh, pour in 14
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:106992:80"/>
inches of Water at the orifice F, till it rest upon the top
of the Mercury at G, and you will find one inch fall
down. Pour in as much, and two inches falls down. In
a word, pour in as much Water, as will fill the Pipe to O,
and you will find the whole six inches fall down. The
reason is, because the Water K I, is not able to sustain,
both the six inches of Mercury and the Water, that's
poured in; any one of them being able and sufficient to
counterpoise it, For an eighth trial, empty the Pipe of
the said Water, and after the Mercury is ascended from
A B to G, as formerly, suck out the whole Air between
G and F, and you will find the Mercury to rise from G to
R 29 inches. The reason of this is evident from the
Pillar of Air S K, that rests upon the top of the Pillar of
Water K I: for by sucking out the said Air, you take
away the <hi>pondus</hi> or weight, that counterpoised the weight
of the Pillar S K, therefore it finding its counterpoise
removed, presently causeth the Water K I, to enter
farder within the crooked Pipe, till it hath prest up the
liquor to R. For a ninth trial, take the six inches of
Mercury B G, and put them into the scale of a ballance;
then take as much Water, as will fill the Tub between
A B and O, and put it into the other scale, and you
will find a most exact counterballance between them.
The reason is, because if the Water K H, or a Pillar of
that hight, be able to raise and counterpoise the Mercury
B G; then must as much Water, as fills the Pipe
betwen B and O, be the just weight of it. The reason of
this consequence is, because these two Waters are of the
same weight: therefore, if the one be the just weight of
it, the other must be so too. If it be said, that the
Water, that fills the Pipe between B and O, is far
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:106992:80"/>
thicker, then the Water K H; therefore they cannot be
both of one weight. I answer, equality of <hi>altitude,</hi> in this
<hi>Ballance of Nature,</hi> is equality of <hi>weight:</hi> therefore
seing the one Water, is as high as the other, they must
be both of one weight. If it be said, that a Pillar of
Water between K and H, cannot counterpoise the six
inches of Mercury B G, both being put into a ballance:
and the reason is, because the one is thicker than the other.
I answer, this only proves that two Pillars differing in
weight in the <hi>Libra</hi> or <hi>Artificial Ballance,</hi> may be of one
weight in the <hi>Natural Ballance:</hi> because in the <hi>Artificial
Ballance,</hi> bodies counterpoise one another, according to
all their dimensions, but in the <hi>Natural Ballance,</hi> such as
this <hi>Engine</hi> is, Fluids counterpoise one another, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their <hi>altitude</hi> only.</p>
               <p>From the first trial, we conclude first, that Water
even in its own place <hi>gravitats</hi> and <hi>weighs,</hi> because this
Water by its Pressure, <hi>de facto</hi> thrusts up 6 inches of
Mercury. We see in the next place, that the Pressure of
a Fluid, is as easily communicated <hi>Horizontally;</hi> as <hi>Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly;</hi>
because the Pressure runs alongst from H to B.
We see thirdly, that Fluids; may have as much Pressure
begotten in them, even while they are environed about
closely with solid bodies, whereby the superior Pressure,
immediatly and directly by perpendicular lines is keeped
off, as if they were immediatly under the Pressure: because
the Mercury A B C D, is as much burdened with the
Pressure, that comes from H, as if the upper part of the
Vessel A B, were open to let in the superior Pressure, by
perpendicular lines. The Air then under the roof of a house,
is under as great a Bensil and Pressure, as the Air without,
that's directly under the Pressure of the Atmosphere.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:106992:81"/>
VVe see fourthly, that the Pressure of a Fluid, may be as
easily communicated thorow the parts of <hi>Heterogeneous</hi>
Fluids, as thorow the parts of <hi>Homogeneous;</hi> because the
Pressure of the VVater K I, is as easily communicated
thorow the Air P H, thorow the Water H B, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the stagnant Mercury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> B D to the orifice E, as if
nothing interveened but VVater. VVe see fifthly, that
Mercury can suffer a Pressure, as well as VVater or Air;
because the six inches cannot rise from B to G, unless the
stagnant Mercury A B C D were compressed, even in
all the parts of it.</p>
               <p>From the second trial, we see, that there cannot be a
<hi>Pondus</hi> in a Fluid, unless there be a <hi>Potentia,</hi> to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poise
it: for when you take away the Water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> R I, by
lifting up the Engine to the top of the Water, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
B G presently falls down. From the third trial, we
conclude, that the Pressure of a Fluid, cannot be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
thorow solid Bodies: for when the <hi>Engine</hi> is
drowned below the Water, with the orifice I, stopped,
no ascent of Mercury follows. We conclude from the
fourth trial, that it is impossible for two Fluids to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise
one another, unless they be <hi>in Equilibrio;</hi> because
the Water K I cannot sustain the Mercury B G, unless
it be of the same weight. From the fifth, we conclude, that
a Fluid may be keeped under the same degree of compres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
after the superior weight that begat it, is taken
away: for after the <hi>Engine</hi> is brought above the Water,
with the orifice I stopped, the Mercury B G is still sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended,
even by vertue of the Pressure, that's in the stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Mercury. This tells us, that a sphere of glass full of
Air, may retain its <hi>Bensil,</hi> even though the whole Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Air, that begat it, were destroyed. From the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:106992:81"/>
sixth we gather, that a Fluid cannot abide under Pressure,
when the burden is taken away that begat it, or that keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it under Pressure: for by opening the orifice I, the
Air P H extends it self: and so are the VVater, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
within the Vessel freed of their Pressure likewise.
We gather from the seventh trial, that in the <hi>Ballance</hi> of
<hi>Nature,</hi> one Scale cannot be more burdened then another;
or that two <hi>Fluids</hi> cannot counterpoise one another, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they be <hi>in equilibrio:</hi> for when you pour in 14
inches of Water, upon the top of the Mercury at G, they
thrust down one inch, that there may be a just <hi>equipon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi>
between them, and the opposite weight K I. We ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the eighth trial, which was observed before;
first, that there cannot be a <hi>Potentia</hi> in a Fluid, unless there
be a <hi>Pondus</hi> to counterpoise it: for when you suck out the
Air G O, which was the <hi>Pondus,</hi> that counterpoised the
Air S K, this presently in stead of it, raiseth 29 inches of
Mercury from G to R. We see secondly, that one pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat
of Air can counterpoise another, Fluids of diverse kinds
interveening: because the Air S K, counterpoises the Air
within the Pipe G O, the VVater K P first interveening;
the Air P H next interveening, and the stagnant, and
suspended Mercury interveening also. We see thirdly from
this eighth trial, that the Pressure of the <hi>Atmosphere,</hi> may
be communicated thorow diverse kinds of Fluids, without
the least diminution of its weight: because the weight of
the Pillar of Air S K, is communicated, and sent down
thorow the Water K I, thorow the Air P H, thorow the
VVater H B, thorow the stagnant Mercury B D, and up
thorow the suspended Mercury B G, till it suspend the
29 inches between G and R, which is the just counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance
of it. We see moreover, that Fluids counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poise
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:106992:82"/>
one another, according to <hi>altitude</hi> only, and not
according to <hi>thickness</hi> and <hi>breadth;</hi> by comparing the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
K I, that's but half an inch thick, to the Mercury B G,
that's a whole inch thick. We see from the last trial, that
when a Fluid is necessitated, to counterpoise a Fluid of
another kind, in stead of a Fluid of its own kind, it sustains
no more of it, than what is the just weight of the Fluid of
its own kind, because the VVater K I, being under a
necessity to counterpoise the Mercury B G, in stead of so
much VVater as would fill the Tub, it sustains no more of
it, than the just weight of so much VVater, as is said.
We see secondly, that when two Fluids of divers kinds,
do counterpoise one another, that which is heaviest <hi>in
speciè,</hi> hath alwayes the shortest Cylinder. Next, that
the difference between their altitudes, is most exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the difference between their <hi>natural</hi> weights,
therefore B G is 14 times lower than B O; because Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
is 14 times heavier than VVater. We see moreover,
that though two Cylinders of a Fluid, can counterpoise
one another in the <hi>Natural Ballance,</hi> such as this <hi>Engine</hi>
is, yet they will not do it in the <hi>Artificial Ballance:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
though B G counterpoise K I in this Ballance, yet in
a pair of Scales, the Mercury will be as heavy again as the
VVater. We see lastly, that notwithstanding of this,
yet such a thing may be; for if the orifice I, were made as
wide as the orifice F, that the Cylinder K I might be equal
to the Mercury B G in thickness, then surely the one
would counterpoise the other in the <hi>Libra</hi> or <hi>Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Ballance.</hi>

Figure 21.</head>
               <p>THis Schematism represents a Water 72 foot deep, as
C D A B, together with a crooked Pipe of glass I N
H, the one half whereof is I P, 56 inches high, and one inch
wide, the other half is P N R H, of a far narrower diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
with an orifice H. There is also an orifice at L, with
a neck, about which is knit a small chord M L, for letting
down this <hi>Engine</hi> to the bottom of the VVater A B. For
trials cause, fill the wide glass with Mercury from P to K,
and you will find it rise in the narrow Pipe, as high as the
orifice H. This being done, close hermetically, or with
good cement the orifice L; then by help of this chord,
let all go down from the surface C D, till it be exactly 17
foot from the top, and you will find the Mercury thrust
down in the narrow Pipe, from H to R, 14 inches and an
half. Let it down next, as much, and the Mercury will be
yet further thrust down, namely from R to N, the part H
R N being full of Water. For understanding the reason
of this, consider that between N and E, are 34 foot: for
so high is the slender Pillar of Water, that comes from the
top, and entring the orifice H, comes down thorow the Pipe
to N. Consider next, that between the said Pillar of Water,
and the Mercury N P K, there is a counterpoise: but this
counterpoise cannot be, unless the Pillar of Water be 34
foot high, seing between N and K are 29 inches of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury;
for each inch thereof requires 14 of Water. Upon
this account it is, that when the glass is 17 foot drowned, 14
inches and an half are thrust down from H to R. If it be
objected, that the <hi>Pressure</hi> and <hi>Bensil</hi> of the inclosed Air
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106992:83"/>
I K; is equivalent to the weight of other 29 inches; and
therefore the Pillar of Water E H R N, must be 68 foot
high, before a counterpoise can happen. I answer, 'tis true
that's said, but you do not consider, that there is a Pillar of
Air F E, resting upon the top of the Pillar of Water, that
makes a compensation exactly. To speak then truely and
really, the 29 inches of Mercury N P K, have the weight
of 58 inches; and the 34 foot of Water E H R N, have
the weight of 68 foot.</p>
               <p>For a third trial, let down the glass 6 foot further, and you
will find the Water pierce up thorow the thick Cylinder of
Mercury P K, and rest upon the top K. The only diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
is to determine, how much will spring up before the
motion of it cease? 'Tis evident, that the Water will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend,
because coming to the <hi>Base</hi> of a thick and gross Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder,
that it cannot intirely lift, it must pierce thorow it,
seing the force of such a Pillar of Water, is now much
stronger, than the Mercury: for in effect, the glass being
drowned 6 foot further, the Pillar that comes down thorow
the slender Pipe, hath the just weight of 34 inches of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury:
but 29 cannot resist 34: therefore the Water not
being able to lift it, by reason of the disproportion that's
between the thickness of the one, and the slenderness of the
other, it must pierce up thorow it. For clearing this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
consider, that this glass cannot go down from one
imaginary surface to another, <hi>v. g.</hi> from 34 foot, where it
was, till it come to 40, where it now stands, but there must
be an alteration in the <hi>equipondium,</hi> seing by going down,
the Pillar of Water E H R N grows higher, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
heavier; and therefore, some VVater must pierce
up thorow the Mercury, for making a counterpoise; for
'tis impossible for two Fluids to counterpoise one another,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106992:83"/>
unless they be in <hi>equilibrio.</hi> Consider secondly, that after
the Water is come to the top of the Mercury at K, it will
find difficulty to find a room for it self, seing the space be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
S and I is full of Air. Notwithstanding of this, it
must ascend. I say then, after the glass is gone down from
34, to 40 foot, there will be about four inches of VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
above K, which have reduced the 29 inches of Air
K I, to 25, S I.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, between what two things is the <hi>equipon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
now? I answer, the first was at R, between E H R,
and R N P K. The second was at R, between N R H E,
and N P K. The third is now at S, between the 25 inches
of inclosed Air I S, as one Antagonist, and the four inches
of Water S K, with the 29 inches of Mercury K P, and
the Water P N R H E, as the other. To make a fourth
<hi>equipondium,</hi> sink the Glass other six foot, till it be 46
foot from the top C D, then must some more VVater
spring up thorow the Mercury; this of necessity must be,
seing the Cylinder of VVater N R H E, is six foot higher,
and so far heavier, than it was: if this be, then must the
25 inches of Air I S, be reduced to less quantity; seing 'tis
impossible, for one Fluid to become heavier, unless its
opposite and <hi>antagonist</hi> become heavier too, for an <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondiums</hi>
sake. Note, that the Air I S, will not lose
other four inches, with this six foot of VVater, as it did
with the former. The reason is, because, if for every six
foot the Glass goeth down, the Air were comprest four
inches, it were easie at last to reduce it to nothing: for if
six reduce it to four, and 12 to eight, 38 ought to reduce
it to no inches, which is impossible. Therefore I judge it
must suffer compression, by a certain proportion, as we
see upon a Scale, the divisions of <hi>Artificial</hi> or <hi>Natural
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:106992:84"/>
Sines</hi> grow less and less, there being more space between
1 and 2, than between 2 and 3; more between 2 and 3,
than between 3 and 4, and so upward till you come to 90.
Therefore the second six foot, must reduce the 25 inches,
not to 21, but to 23 <hi>circiter,</hi> and so forth. By the which
means, though the Glass should go down <hi>in infinitum,</hi> yet
the Air shall never be reduced to nothing, and there shall
still some small quantity of VVater come up. Or in such
a case, the Air may be so comprest, that it can be no more,
all the <hi>disseminate vacuities</hi> being expelled. But suppose
this to be at 1000 fathom, then at 1500, where the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is stronger, there can be no <hi>equipondium,</hi> which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
for where the <hi>pondus</hi> becomes stronger, the <hi>potentia</hi>
ought to grow stronger likewise. I answer, the motion of
condensation ceaseth indeed; but there still remains a <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia,</hi>
or rather in such a case, a perfect <hi>resistentia,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Air is able to resist the greatest weight imaginable,
before it can be reduced to nothing, or suffer a penetration
of parts, that's to say, two parts to be in one space.</p>
               <p>From the explication of these Phenomena we conclude
first, that in Water there is a considerable Pressure, seing
in letting down the Glass 17 foot, the Mercury is prest
down from H to R, and from R to N, in going down
other 17 foot. Secondly, that 29 inches of Mercury are
as heavy as 34 foot of VVater: because the Mercury K
P N makes a just <hi>equipondium</hi> with the VVater E H R N.
Thirdly, that Fluids not only of the same kind, but of
different kinds, do counterpoise one another according to
<hi>altitude,</hi> and not according to <hi>thickness;</hi> because though
the Mercury K P N be far thicker, than the VVater E H,
yet they counterballance one another, because a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is kept according to their <hi>altitudes.</hi> Fourthly, that a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:106992:84"/>
Fluid <hi>naturally</hi> lighter, may move a Fluid <hi>naturally</hi> heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
and thrust it out of its own place, because the Water
coming in at H, thrusts down the Mercury to R, and from
R to N, and so forth. Fifthly, that of two F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uids un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
in strength, debating together, the weaker of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
must yeeld to the stronger, though the weaker be
far heavier naturally than the stronger, as is evident in the
Mercu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, that yeelds to the Water. Sixthly, that it is
impossible for two Fluids, so long as they are unequal in
strength, to cease from motion, till they come to an <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondium;</hi>
because the Water alwayes springs up thorow
the Mercury, till an equal Ballance happen. Seventhly,
that one Fluid of this kind, can counterpoise another Fluid
of the same kind, though there be divers Fluids interveen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
because the Air F E, counterpoiseth the Air I K, or
I S, notwithstanding of Water and Mercury interveening.
Eighthly, that there may be as much Pressure in one inch
of a Fluid, as in a million; because the 29 inches of Air
I S, have as much <hi>Bensil</hi> in them, as is in the whole Pillar of
Air E F, that goeth up from the top of the VVater, to
the top of the <hi>Atmosphere.</hi> Ninthly, that when one Fluid
is under Pressure, the next must be under the same degree
of Pressure, though they be not of the same kind, but of
different sorts; because the Air I S, the Water S K, and
Mercury K P, are surely under the same degree of Pressure;
otherwise the motion could not end. Tenthly, that when
two Fluids of divers kinds do press one another, that which
is <hi>naturally</hi> lighter, ascends alwayes to the higher place, and
the heavier to the lowest: because the Air I S, is above
the Water S K, and the Water S K is above the Mercury.
Note, that this is not universal, but only happens when
the lighter Cylinder, is slenderer than the other, for if the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:106992:85"/>
Mercury K P, were no thicker than the Water P N R H,
this would raise it intirely. Eleventhly, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of Air to less space, is not according to <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical
progression,</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but according to some
other proportion, which may be called <hi>Uniform-difform.</hi>
Note here, that though this be true of the Air, while it
is comprest from a more quantity to a less, as here, or in a
<hi>Wind-Gun;</hi> yet it is not true of the Pressure of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Air, which is more and more from the top of the
<hi>Atmosphere</hi> to the <hi>Earth,</hi> according to <hi>Arithmetical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,</hi>
as in Water. We see lastly, that the heaviest
of Fluids, such as Mercury, press upward, as well as down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
because the top of the Mercury K, thrusts up the
Water K S, as well as it thrusts down the Water P N
R H. It may be enquired here, how far this Glass would
go down, before the 29 inches of Air I K were reduced
to one inch? I answer, its hard to determine; but it seems
it ought to go down more than 300 fathom. In this
case, there would be 28 inches of Water above K. Let
us suppose the orifice H to be stopped at that deepness,
and the Glass brought above the Water; then, when the
said orifice is opened in the Air, you will find the whole
VVater P N R H thrust out: and not only this, but the
whole Mercury P K, spring out at the orifice H like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
except a little that remains between N and H: the
reason is, because the 29 inches of Air, being reduced to
one, would be under a very great <hi>Bensil;</hi> therefore the
weight being taken away that begat it, of its own accord,
it would expand it self to its old dimensions; which it
could not do, unless both the 28 inches of VVater, that's
supposed to be above K, and the Mercury K P were
thrust out of their places.</p>

Figure 22.</head>
               <p>THis Schematism represents a vessel full of VVater 84
inches deep, namely from L N the first surface, to
M R the bottom. From M to R in breadth are 20
inches. There are here also two Glass-Pipes open at both
ends; the one, two inches wide, the other half an inch
wide. Both of them are 85 inches long. X Y O is a
surface of stagnant Mercury, among which the two ends
of the Pipes are drowned. E C is a Pillar of Mercury
six inches in height, and so is G D, both of them raised to
that altitude, by the Pressure of the Water upon the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
X Y O. The Pillar E C A is supported by, and
rests upon, the imaginary Pillar A P. And so is the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
G D B, supported by the Pillar B Q. There are three
things that occurres here from this operation of nature to
be enquired after. First, why ought the Mercury to rise
in the two Tubs, after the Vessel is filled with Water?
Secondly, why rather six inches, then seven or eight?
Thirdly, what's the reason, why it rises as high in the wide
T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>b, as in the narrow? I answer, the Mercury rises from
C to E, and from D to G, by the Pressure of the
Water, that rests upon the surface X Y O. Before
that the Water is poured into the Vessel, there is here a
most equal and uniform Pressure upon the surface X Y O,
both without and within the Tub, namely from the Air
that rests upon it. But no sooner is the Water poured in,
but as soon the Pressure becomes unequal; the parts of
the surface without the Tub, being more burdened, then
the parts C and D within. Therefore, the part that's

                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:106992:87"/>
less prest, must rise and climb up, till the Pressure become
equal: for it's impossible that a Fluid can cease from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so long as there is inequality of weight between the
<hi>pondus</hi> and the <hi>potentia.</hi> If any doubt, let him pie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce the
side of the Vessel, and when the whole Water is run out,
he will find E C and G D to have fallen down, which
clearly proves the climbing up of the Mercury, to depend
upon the in-pouring of the Water. For understanding
the reason of the second, remember that Mercury (as we
have often noted) is counted 14 times heavier then Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
therefore E C must be six inches, seing X Y O is
prest with the altitude of 84 inches of Water. It would
be judged no marvel, to see the Mercury rise from C to E,
and from D to G, provided the face of the stagnant Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
were as high as Z F. No more strange it is, to see
the two Mercuries rise, with the Pressure of the Water;
for in effect and really, the said Water is the just weight
of as much Mercury as would fill between X O and Z F.
For understanding the third, remember (as was noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
that Fluid Bodies counterpoise one another, only
according to <hi>altitude:</hi> therefore 'tis no matter, whether
the Tubs be wide or narrow. If it be enquired, how can
one and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame Water, counterpoise two Fluids of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
weights? To say, that Fluids counterpoise one
another according to <hi>altitude,</hi> doth not clear the difficulty;
for it still remains to be asked, why they counterpoise one
another after this manner? Therefore it seems, that if
the Water raise the Mercury from C to E in the wide Pipe,
it must raise it in the narrow one from D to K. For
answer, consider first, that as there are here two Pillars of
Mercury C E, and D G within the two Tubs, so there
are here also two Pillars of Mercury A P and B Q, under
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:106992:87"/>
the two orifices, upon which the said two Pillars stand,
and rest. Consider secondly, that the <hi>Potentia</hi> or force of
the Pillar A P, is just equal to the <hi>Pondus</hi> of the Pillar
E C A: Item, that the <hi>Potentia</hi> of the Pillar B Q, is
equal to the <hi>Pondus</hi> G D B. Thirdly, that the <hi>Potentia</hi>
of A P. is most exactly equal to the <hi>Potentia</hi> of B Q;
and the reason is, because their tops A and B, are parts
of the same horizontal surface. I say then, if A P be
equal to E C A, and B Q equal to G D B, and A P,
and B Q, equal among themselves, then must E C A
be equal to G D B. The same Water then, doth
not counterpoise two Bodies of different weight. I grant
E C A to be far heavier, than G D B, while they are
weighed in a pair of scales, but the one is not heavier than
the other, as they are weighed in this <hi>ballance</hi> of <hi>nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From what is said, we see first, that in VVater there
is a Pressure, and a considerable weight. This is evident
from the rising of the Mercury. VVe see secondly, that
Fluids counterpoise one another, only according to <hi>Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi>
Thirdly, that when a lighter Fluid presseth up a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,
there is no more prest up of it, than is the just weight
of the pressing Fluid, because the Mercury E C, is just
the weight of the VVater that presseth upon X Y O. That's
to say, the part of the surface C, is no more prest with
the Mercury E C, than the part X, is prest with the
VVater L Z X. Fourthly, if Mercury were 28 times
heavier than VVater, only three inches would be prest
up: if it were but seven times heavier, the altitude would
be at S, 12 inches above C. Fifthly, it's as easie for a
large part of a surface, to sustain a large Pillar, as 'tis
for a narrow part, to sustain a narrower Pillar: because
A P sustains E C A, as easily, as B Q sustains G D B.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106992:88"/>
Sixthly, that in Fluids there is a <hi>pondus</hi> and a <hi>potentia:</hi> as
is clear from the <hi>potentia</hi> of A P, that sustains the <hi>pondus</hi>
of E C A. The VVater likewise that sustains, hath a
<hi>potentia,</hi> and the Mercury E C is the <hi>pondus</hi> of it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly,
that there is alwayes equality of weight between
the <hi>pondus</hi> and the <hi>potentia.</hi> So is the <hi>potentia</hi> of A P,
equal to the <hi>pondus</hi> E C A. Eighthly, that the <hi>pondus</hi>
begets the <hi>potentia.</hi> So the weight of the VVater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
the <hi>potentia</hi> that's in A P. For make this VVater
deeper, and you augment the <hi>potentia</hi> of A P. If you
subtract from it, the <hi>potentia</hi> of A P grows less by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.
Or the weight of E C A, may be said to beget
the <hi>potentia</hi> of A P. To proceed a little further, let us
suppose the Air H E to be removed. In this case, the
Mercury rises 29 inches higher than E, or 35 above C;
even as high as S. In the narrow Tub it will climb up to
K, if you take away the Air I G. This comes to pass,
by vertue of the Pressure of the <hi>Atmosphere,</hi> that rests
upon L N. From this we gather ninthly, that there is
a counterpoise between the Air H E, and the weight of
the Air that rests upon L N; and that a slender Pillar of
Air, is able to counterpoise a thicker: for H E is far nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
than L N. Tenthly, that the Pressure of the Air,
can be communicated thorow divers kinds of Fluids; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the weight that rests upon L N, is sent down tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the VVater L Z X, and down thorow the stagnant
Mercury, and thrusts up the Liquor from A to S, 35 inches.
Eleventhly, that a lighter Fluid may be made to press with
greater burden, than a Fluid <hi>naturally</hi> heavier; because the
weight of the Air upon L N, raises 29 inches of Mercury,
but the VVater raises only six. VVe see twelfthly, that
Fluids have a sphere of activity, to which they are able to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106992:88"/>
press up themselves, or Fluids of different kinds: because
first, the stagnant Mercury can raise it self no higher with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Pipe, than it is without. Next, the 84 inches of
Water, can raise the Mercury no higher than E. Lastly,
the weight of the <hi>Atmosphere,</hi> can raise the Mercury no
higher than S, 29 inches above E.</p>
               <p>For another trial, take out from among the Water, the
two Pipes, and stopping closely the two under orifices,
fill them with Mercury to the brim. Then thrust them
down as before, and open the said two orifices, while they
are below the surface X Y O, and you will find the whole
Cylinder fall down from H to E, and there halt: and the
whole Cylinder in the narrow Pipe falls down from I to
G. Or, if you please, before this be done, stop closely
the orifice H, and the orifice I, and you will find the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
go no further down than S, by opening the orifice A;
and no further down than K, by opening the orifice B.
This leads us to a clear discovery of the reason, why the
Mercury subsides, and sinks down from the top of the Tub
in the <hi>Baroscope,</hi> to the 29th inch, whatever the diameter
of the Pipe be. And this lets us see, that the Mercurial
Cylinder is suspended by the Air, after the same manner,
that the Mercury E C is suspended after: and that there is
no more difficulty in the one, than in the other.</p>

               <head>EXPERIMENT XVII.
Figure 23, 24.</head>
               <p>THis Schematism represents a Water 30 fathom deep.
Under the first surface A, there are six imaginary, as
B C D E F G, every one whereof, is five fathom below
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:106992:89"/>
another. There are here likewise two Glasses, each one
12 inches high, and 5 inches broad, like unto these,
wherein Wine, Sack, or Brandy is preserved. The Glass
G M hath its orifice G upward. The other Glass is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
open below, without a narrow orifice. For making
Experiment, take a long chord, as long as the Water is in
deepness, and knit the end of it round about the neck of
the Glass at G. Take another line of the same length,
and fasten it to the bottom of the other Glass at L. Next,
for sinking the two Glasses, take two weights of Lead,
and fasten the one to the bottom at M, and the other to
the open part of the Glass at S, and T. The two weights
then, are P and Q, each one of them about 10 or 12
pound weight. These things being done, let first down
the Glass G M, till the weight Q sink it five fathom,
namely from A to B, and if you pull it up, you will find
the bottom covered with Water, from M to I, about four
or five inches. Let it down next, from A to C, ten fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom,
and you will find more Water in it; even as much
as fills it from M to 2, about seven or eight inches. In
passing from C D, the Water rises from 2 to 3. If
you sink it, from D to E, the VVater rises from 3 to
4. The VVater rises from 4 to 5, when the glass
is come the length of F. And lastly, when the Glass is at
G, the lowest fathom, the VVater is as high as K. Let
down next, the other Glass from A to B, and you will
find the Water rise in it from H to I, four or five inches,
as in the other Glass. In going down from B to C, it
rises from 1 to 2. From C to D, it rises from 2
to 3. From D to E, it rises from 3 to 4, and so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
till the Glass come to the lowest fathom, where
the Water rises as high as I.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:106992:89"/>
There are here several <hi>Phenomena</hi> to be considered.
First, that the Water <hi>creeps</hi> in at the orifice G, and fills
the under part of the Glass from M to K. Secondly, that
<hi>not one particle</hi> of Air comes out, all the time the VVater
is in going in. Thirdly, that this Air is comprest from
M to K, nine inches. Lastly, that the ingress of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is according to <hi>unequal proportion:</hi> because while the
Glass passeth from A to B, more VVater <hi>creeps</hi> in at G,
and fills the bottom, then in passing from B to C. And
more in going down from B to G, than in going down
from C to D, as is clear from the unequal divisions 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, For understanding the reason of the first, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that in this deep Water, there is a Pressure, and
that this Pressure grows, as the VVater grows in deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
It is then by vertue of this, that the VVater <hi>creeps</hi>
in, and fills the bottom of the Vessel: for in effect, every
part being under a burden, and being therefore desirous to
liberat themselves from it, they take occasion to thrust in
themselves, finding, as it were, more ease here, than
without, the Air within the Glass, being under less Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
than the VVater without. The second <hi>Phenomenon</hi>
is caused by the straitness and narrowness of the hole G:
for this entry being no wider, than the thickness of a Sack-Needle,
the Air cannot go out, while the VVater is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in; that is, the passage is so strait, that the one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
go by the other. This leads us to the reason of the
third, for if not one <hi>particle</hi> of Air go out, all the while
the Glass is in going down, then surely, the VVater fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
between M and K, must compress the Air, and reduce
it from twelve inches to three. But the greater difficulty
is, why the ingress of the VVater is according to <hi>unequal
proportion.</hi> For understanding this, consider, that this
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106992:90"/>
inequality, is not caused by any unequal Pressure that's in
the VVater; for if this were true, then there ought to be
less Pressure in the surface F, than in the surface E, and
less in E, than in D, which is false and absurd. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality
then, must flow from the nature of the Air it self,
that naturally suffers compression after such a manner. 'Tis
evident from the compression of Air in <hi>Wind-guns;</hi> for
less force is required to compress the first span, than to
compress the second: or contrariwise, more strength is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
to compress the third span, than the second;
more to compress the fourth, than the third, and so forth.
'Tis evident in all bodies endowed with Bensil, as in the
<hi>Spring</hi> of a <hi>Watch,</hi> that requires more strength to bend it.
in the end, than in the beginning.</p>
               <p>For a second trial, pull up from the bottom of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Glass L I H, and when it comes above, you will
find nothing in it. The reason is, because the Vessel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
open between T and S, the whole VVater I H, falls
down by degrees; but in effect, is really thrust out, by the
strong <hi>Bensil</hi> of the comprest Air I L, that now expands
it self, when it finds the Glass go up thorow the VVater,
whose Pressure is less, and less from the bottom to the top.
but the contrary effect follows, when the other Glass is
pulled up; namely, the VVater remains within the Glass,
and the Air above it, is thrust out by degrees, as the Glass
comes nearer to the top. For understanding the reason of
this, consider first, that while the orifice G, is level with
the lowest surface, where it now is; that's supposed to be
30 fathom deep, there is a real counterpoise between the
inclosed Air G K, and the ambient VVater without: for
with what force the one strives to be in, with the same force
the other endeavours to be out; and because they are in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106992:90"/>
equal terms, therefore the one cannot yeeld to the other.
If you please to give the victory to the VVater, then let
the Glass go further down: but if you desire the Air to
overcome, then must the Glass be pulled up. Pull it then
up from the place it is in, till it come to F, and you will find
a considerable quantity of Air come out at G, and after 2 or 3
minuts of time, emerge and come to the top A, in form of
round Bells, or Bubbles. The deepness and groseness of the
Water thorow which the Bubbles come, makes their motion
so slow. The reason of this eruption, must be less Pressure of
Water in the surface F, than in the lowest G, from whence
the Glass came. Suppose then, the lowest to have six degrees
of Pressure, F to have five, E to have four, D three, C two,
and B to have one: and supposing the inclosed Air K G, to be
equal in force to the Pressure of the lowest fathom, it must
then have six degrees of <hi>Bensil</hi> in it. Put the case then,
that with six degrees of <hi>Bensil,</hi> it come to the surface F,
that hath but five, it must surely break forth, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the force and <hi>power</hi> of that surface: for 'tis impossible
that two Fluids can be unequal in force and power, but
the strongest must overcome, and the weakest yeeld:
therefore, when the orifice comes to F, the Air being
stronger than the Water, breaks forth; and as long
doth this eruption continue, as inequality of power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
between the one and the other. In pulling up the
Glass from F to E, other five fathom, more Air comes
out. The reason is the same, namely less Pressure in E
than in F: therefore, when the inclosed Air, that hath
five degrees of <hi>Bensil,</hi> comes to E, that hath but four, it
must overcome, and so long must it be victorious, till by
expanding it self, it be reduced to the <hi>Bensil</hi> of four. In
pulling up the Glass from E to D, more Air yet breaks
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106992:91"/>
out, because a surface of three degrees of Pressure, is not
able to resist four degrees of <hi>Bensil.</hi> In passing from D to
C, more Air comes yet out for the same reason, till in
going up to the top, where there is no Pressure, no more
Air breaks out.</p>
               <p>'Tis to be observed first, that the motion of the Air
up thorow the Water is but slow, the <hi>medium</hi> being thick,
and gross. Secondly, that if the Glass be pulled up quickly,
from one surface to another, or contrariwise, let down
quickly, it presently breaks in pieces. This comes to pass
through the strong <hi>Bensil</hi> of the inclosed Air, that must
have time to expand it self, otherwise it breaks out at the
nearest: for it being of six degrees of Bensil, and coming
quickly to a surface of five, there happens an unequal
Pressure, the sides of the Glass being thrust out, with
greater force, than they are thrust in with. But if so be,
the Glass move slowly up, the inclosed Air gets time to
thrust it self out by degrees, so that whatever surface the
Glass comes to, there is little difference between the
Pressure of the Water, and the <hi>Bensil</hi> of the Air. The
reason why the Glass breaks in pieces, while it goes quickly
down, is likewayes unequal Pressure upon the sides: for
in passing quickly from a surface of five degrees, to a surface
of six, the sides are prest in with greater force, than they
are prest out with, and the reason is, because through the
straitness of the hole G, the Water cannot win in soon
enough, to make as much Pressure within, as there is
without. 'Tis to be observed thirdly; that if the orifice
G be stopped, before that the Glass be sent down, it
will not go beyond three or four fathom, when it shall
be broken in pieces; though the motion were never so
slow: and this comes to pass, through the strong Pressure
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:106992:91"/>
of the Water. Fourthly, the stronger the Glass be in
the sides, it goes the further down without breaking:
therefore a round <hi>Glass Bottle,</hi> will sink 20 or 30 fathom,
before that it be broken with the Pressure of the Water.
If a Vessel of iron were sent down, it ought to go much
further. An empty <hi>Cask,</hi> or <hi>Hogsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ad,</hi> will not sink
beyond seven or eight fathom, without breaking, or
bursting; yet a Bladder full of wind, knit about the neck
with a Pack-Threed, will go down 100 fathom, yea
1000 without bursting.</p>
               <p>It may be here inquired, what sort of proportion is
keeped by the <hi>unequal ingress</hi> of the Water? I answer, it
may be known after this manner. Let first down the
Glass one fathom, and having pulled it up again, measure
the deepness of the Water in the bottom, of it. Next,
having poured out that Water, let it down two fathom,
and pulling it up, measure the deepness, which you will
find more, than afore. Do after this manner, the third
time, and the fourth time, till you come to the lowest
fathom, and you will find the true proportion.</p>
               <p>From what is said we see first, that in Water there is a
Pressure, because through the force and power of this
Water, the 12 inches of Air that filled the Glass, are
reduced to three. Secondly, that this Pressure growes,
as the Water growes in deepness: because there is more
Pressure in B, than in A, more in C, than in B; and Io
downward. Thirdly, that when Air is comprest, by
some extrinseck weight, the <hi>Bensil</hi> is intended, and grows
stronger by <hi>unequal proportion,</hi> as is clear from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
divisions, 1, 2, 2, 4, 5, 6. Fourthly, two Fluids
cannot cease from motion, so long as the <hi>potentia</hi> of the
one, is unequal to the <hi>po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> of the other: this is evident
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:106992:92"/>
from the Water's creeping in at G, all the while the Glass
is in going down; and from the Air's coming out, all the
while the Glass is in coming up. Fifthly, that no sooner
two Fluids come to equality of weight, but as soon the
motion ends: because, if the Glass halt at D, E or F, in the
going down, upon which follows a counterpoise, then
doth the creeping in of the Water cease. Sixthly, there
may be as much Pressure in a small quantity of a Fluid, as in
the greatest: because there is as much <hi>Bensil</hi> in the small
portion of Air, included between K and G, as there is of
Pressure, and weight, in this whole Water, that's 30
fathom deep. Seventhly, that the <hi>Pressure</hi> of a Fluid,
is a thing really distinct, from the <hi>natural weight:</hi> this is
evident from the Pressure of the inclosed Air G K, that's
more and less, as the Pressure of the Water K M, is
more and less, but the <hi>natural weight</hi> is still the same, seing
the same quantity remains. Eighthly, one part of a
Fluid, cannot be under Pressure, but the next adjacent,
must be under the same degree of Pressure: this is also
clear, because what ever degree of bensil the included Air
K G is under, the Water K M is under the same. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when the one is under six, as in the lowest fathom,
the other is under six likewise. And when the one is
under five degrees of Pressure, as in the surface F, the
other is under as much. Ninthly, <hi>Bensil</hi> and <hi>Pressure</hi> are
equivalent to <hi>weight:</hi> because the Water K M, is as
much burdened with the <hi>Bensil</hi> of that small portion of Air
above it, as if it had a Pillar of Water 30 fathom high
upon it. Tenthly, that the Pressure of Fluids, is most
uniform and equal, and that two Fluids of different kinds,
may press as uniformly, as if they were but one: this is
evident from the sides of the Glass, that are not broken
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:106992:92"/>
in pieces, by the strong <hi>Bensil</hi> of the inclosed Air, and
heavy Pressure of the inclosed Water; and this happens
because the Pressure without, is as strong as the Pressure
within. We see lastly, that <hi>Water does not weigh in
Water,</hi> because when a man lets down this Glass by the
chord, to the lowest surface, he finds not the weight of
the Water K M, that's within the Glass, but only the
weight of the Lead Q. 'Tis certain, he finds not the
weight of the Water I H; because it rests not upon the
Glass within, but is sustained by 'its own surface, the
mouth of the Glass being downward, and open. When
I say <hi>Water does not weigh in Water;</hi> the meaning is not,
that Water wants weight or Pressure in it, but that this
weight and Pressure is not found, as the weight and Pressure
of other bodies are found, while they are weighed in
Water. For example, a piece of Lead or Gold, hung in
the Water by a string, the other end being fastened to a
Ballance in the Air, <hi>gravitats,</hi> and weighs down the Scale;
and the reason is, because Lead and Gold, are naturally
and <hi>specifically</hi> heavier than VVater; but a piece of Metal
of the same <hi>specifick</hi> weight with Water, or VVater it
self, cannot <hi>gravitat</hi> in VVater, or weigh down the Scale
of a Ballance; and the reason is, because the surface of
Water upon which they rest, bears them up with as great
weight and force, as they press down with. If it be said,
that the Water K M, rests upon the bottom of the Glass
within; and therefore, if the man above, find the weight of
the Glass, he must find the weight of the Water within it.
I answer, the consequence is bad, because the weight of the
Water within, is sustained, and counterpoised by the weight
of the Water without, whereupon the bottom of the Glass
rests. That's to say, as there is a Pillar of Water K M within
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:106992:93"/>
the Glass, that presseth down the bottom, so there is a
Pillar of Water without the Glass, whereupon the bottom
of the Glass rests, and which bears up both. But the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
difficulty is this, the further down the Glass goes,
it grows the heavier, because of more and more Water,
that creeps in at G. Now 'tis certain, the weight Q grows
not heavier, therefore it must be the Water within the
Glass, that makes the increase of the weight; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Water must still weigh in VVater. If this argument
had any strength in it, it would prove the weight of the
VVater I H to gravitat and weigh likewise; because the
further down this glass goes, it grows the heavier, because
of more, and more Water, that creeps up from H to I.
Now 'tis certain, the weight of Lead B grows not heavier.
Behold, the difficulty is the same in both, and yet it were
rashness to affirm the Water I H to be found by a mans
hand, when he pulls up the Glass with a string, seing it is
sustained by its own surface, and not by any part of the
Glass. Though this might suffice for an answer, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the contrary is mantained by some, and that with a
new Experiment to prove it, I shall be at some more pains
to vindicat the truth of what I have said.</p>
               <p>This new Experiment to prove that <hi>Water weighs in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
I found in a <hi>Philosophical Transaction,</hi> of <hi>August</hi> 16.
Anno 1669. <hi>Numb.</hi> 50, the Invention whereof is
attributed by the publisher, to that honorable and worthy
Person Mr. <hi>Boyl,</hi> whose conclusions and trials, I never
much called in question, but finding this opposite, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to what I have demonstrated, I shall crave liberty to
say, <hi>amicus Socrates, amicus Plato, sed magis amica veritas;</hi>
and shall therefore examine it as briefly as may be. The
words of the Publisher are as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:106992:93"/>
The Author of this Invention is the Noble <hi>Robert Boyl;</hi>
who was pleased to comply with our desires, of communicating
it in English to the curious in <hi>England,</hi> as by inserting the
same in the <hi>Latine</hi> Translation of his <hi>Hydrostatical Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes,</hi>
he hath gratified the Ingenious abroad. And it will
doubtless be the more welcome, for as much as no body, we know
of, hath so much as attempted to determine, how much Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
may weigh in Water; and possibly, if such a Problem had
been proposed, it would have been judged impracticable.</p>
               <p>The Method or Expedient, he made use of, to perform it, as
near as he could, may easily be learned by the ensuing accompt
of a Trial or two, he made for that purpose, which among his
Notes he caused to be registred in the following words.</p>
               <p>A Glass-bubble of about the bigness of a Pullets egg, was
purposely blown at the flame of a Lamp, with a somewhat long
stem turned up at the end, that it might the more conveniently
be broken off. This Bubble being well heated to rarify the Air;
and thereby drive out a good part of it, was nimbly sealed at
the end, and by the help of the Figure of the stem, was by a
convenient Weight of Lead depressed under Water, the Lead
and Glass being tyed by a string to a Scale of a good Ballance,
in whose other there was put so much weight, as sufficed to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise
the Bubble, as it hung freely in the midst of the Water.
Then with a long Iron <hi>Forceps,</hi> I carefully broke off the seal'd
end of the Bubble under Water, so as no Bubble of Air appear'd
to emerge or escape through the Water, but the Liquor by the
weight of the <hi>Atmosphere,</hi> sprung into the un-replenish'd part
of the Glass-Bubble, and fill'd the whole cavity about half full;
and presently, as I foretold, the Bubble subsided, and made
the Scale 'twas fastned to, preponderate so much, that there
needed 4 drachms, and 38 grains to reduce the Ballance to
an <hi>equilibrium.</hi> Then taking out the Bubble with the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106992:94"/>
in it, we did, by the help of a flame of a Candle, warily apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
drive out the Water (which otherwise is not easily excluded
at a very narrow stem) into a Glass counterpoised before;
and we found it, as we expected, to weigh about four
drachms and 30 grains, besides some little that remained in
the Egg, and some small matter that might have been rarified
into vapors, which added to the piece of Glass that was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off under Water and lost there, might very well amount to
7 or 8 grains. By which it appears not only, that Water
hath some weight in Water, but that it weighs very near,
or altogether as much in Water, as the self same portion of
Liquor would weigh in the Air.</p>
               <p>The same day we repeated the Experiment with another seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Bubble, larger then the former (being as big as a great Hens-egg)
and having b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oken this under Water, it grew heavier
by 7. drachms and 34 grains; and having taken out the
Bubble, and driven out the Water into a counter pois'd Glass,
we found the transvasated Liquor to amount to the same
weight, abating 6 or 7 grains, which it might well have lost
upon such accompts, as have been newly mentioned. <hi>Thus he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Figure 24.</p>
               <p>THe design then of this Experiment is to prove
<hi>that water weighs in Water;</hi> but, it seems, there
is here a very great mistake, which I shall make out after
this manner. For which cause, let this Schematism 24
represent the Experiment already described. The <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lass-bubble</hi>
then is E P F R. The stem is H C: the weight
that sinks the Glass is B. The surface of Water under
which it is drowned, is A D. The Ballance to which the
Glass is knit by a string is N O. And lastly E F R is
the Water that came in, and filled the half of the Bubble.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:106992:94"/>
Now I say, it is not the weight of the Water E F R,
that turnes the Scales above, and makes an alteration in
the Ballance, but 'its only the weight of the <hi>Lead</hi> B,
that does it. For evincing this, consider that all heavy
bodies, are either lighter in <hi>specie</hi> than Water; as cork<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
or of the same <hi>specifick</hi> weight with it, as some Wood is,
or last<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y heavier in <hi>specie</hi> than Water, as Lead or Gold.
Now 'tis certain, that bodies of the first sort cannot
<hi>weigh in Water,</hi> and the reason is, because they being
naturally lighter, their whole weight is supported by the
Water, and therefore not one part of them, can be born
up by a Ballance above. A piece of Cork that weighs 12
ounces in the Air, weighs nothing in Water, because as
soon as it toucheth the surface, the whole weight of it is
supported, and therefore cannot affect the Ballance above.
But bodies of the third sort, as is clear from experience
and reason, does really weigh in Water: And the reason
is, because they being naturally heavier than water, their
whole weight cannot be supported by it, and therefore
some part of them must burden the Ballance, to which the
body is knit. A piece of Lead, that weighs 12 ounces in
the Air, will not lose above 2 ounces, when 'its weighed
in Water; or may be less. But here there is no difficulty.
The question then is, in order to bodies of the same <hi>speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick</hi>
weight with Water, as some Wood is, or as Water
is. I say of such also, that they cannot weigh in Water;
and the reason is, because they being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ust of the same
weight, must have their whole weight supported by it;
even as one foot of Water, supports the whole weight of
the foot above it. It may be evidenced after this manner.
Take a piece of Wood, that's lighter in <hi>specie</hi> than Water,
and add weight to it by degrees, till it become of the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:106992:95"/>
same weight with Water. Knit it with a string to a
Ballance, ond weigh it in Water, and you will find the
whole weight supported by the Water. And the reason
is, because, being left to it self, it can go no further down,
than till the upper part of it, be level with the surface of
the Water. Now, the whole weight being thus sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
not one ounce of it can burden the Ballance. In
a word, the Ballance can never be burdened, unless the
body that's knit to it, have an inclination to go to the
ground, when left to it self, which a body of the same
weight with Water can never have. I conclude then,
if a body of the same weight with Water, cannot
<hi>weigh in Water,</hi> neither can <hi>Water weigh in Water,</hi> seing
Water is of the same weight with Water. And There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Water E F R, that's now within the <hi>Bubble,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
in anywise burden the Ballance above; but must be
supported wholly by the Water I K G H, upon which
the bottom of the Glass rests. If it be said, that the
Glass it self is supported by the Ballance, because 'its
heavier in <hi>specie</hi> than Water; therefore the VVater
within that rests upon the sides of it, must be supported
likewise by it. I answer, the whole weight of the Glass
is not supported, by the Ballance, but only a part; the
VVater I K G H supporting the other part. And this
part is just as much as is the weight of VVater, that's
expelled by the Glass. Now, if the said VVater sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
so much of the Glass, because it is the just weight of
so much VVater, why should it not also, support the
VVater within the Glass? Seing the VVater within the
Glass, is just the weight of as much VVater, as will fill
the space E F R.</p>
               <p>I come in the next place to shew, that it is the weight
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:106992:95"/>
of the Lead B that turns the Scales, when the VVater
comes in at C, and fills the half of the sphere. For
understanding this, let us suppose first, the weight that's
in the Scale O to weigh six ounces. Secondly, that the
Glass takes 12 ounces to sink it compleatly under the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
A D. Thirdly, the weight B to be 18 ounces;
namely for this cause, first, that 12 of it may sink the
Glass; next, that the other six may counterpoise the six
in the Scale O. Lastly, that the VVater within the
Glass weighs six ounces. I abstract from the weight of the
Glass it self, which is not considerable, seing the most part
of it, is supported by the VVater, and not by the Ballance.
Now, I say, 'tis six ounces of the weight B that makes
this alteration, and turnes the Scales. For if 12 ounces
sink the Glass below the VVater, when 'its full of Air,
and no Water in it, then surely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ix are sufficient to sink it,
when it is half full. And the reason is, because there is a
less <hi>Potentia</hi> or force in six inches of Air, by the one half,
to counterpoise a weight of 12 ounces, than in 12 inches of
Air. Therefore this Air, being reduced from 12 inches
to six, it must take only six ounces to sink it. If this be,
then the other six ounces that now wants a party to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise
them, must burden the Ballance, and be supported
by the Scale: and therefore, to make a new <hi>equipondium</hi>
again, you must make the weight O 12 ounces, by adding
six to it, that it may counterpoise 12 of B, the other six
being counterpoised by the Air E P F. Let us suppose
next, this Glass to be compleatly full of VVater, and
the whole Air expelled. In this case the Scale O, must
have 18 ounces in it, for making a new <hi>equip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ndium.</hi> The
reason is, because there being no Air in the Glass to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise
any part of B, the whole weight of it must be
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106992:96"/>
sustained by the Ballance, and therefore in the Scale O,
there must be 18. Now, I enquire, whether these 18
ounces, are the <hi>equipondium</hi> of the VVater within the Glass,
or of the weight of <hi>Lead</hi> B? 'Tis impossible it can coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise
them both, seing the VVater is now 12, and B
18. It must then either be the counterballance of the
Water, or the counterballance of the <hi>Lead.</hi> It cannot be
the first, because 12 cannot be in <hi>equipondio</hi> with 18, It
must then be the second. Or if these 18 ounces in the Scale
O, be the counterpoise of the Water within the Glass, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what sustains the weight of the <hi>Lead</hi> B? The weight
of it, cannot be sustained by the Water, because 'tis a
body naturally heavier than Water, it must therefore be
sustained by the Ballance, I conclude then, that <hi>Water
cannot weigh in Water.</hi> If it be objected, that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
seems to contradict, and oppose the Pressure of the
Water, that's been hitherto confirmed with so many
Experiments. I answer, the <hi>Pressure of the Water</hi> is one
thing, and <hi>Water to weigh in Water</hi> is another. The
first is, when one Pillar of Water counterpoises another,
or when a Pillar of Water counterpoises a Pillar of Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or is counterpoised by a Pillar of Air, all which is in
order to the <hi>Natural Ballance,</hi> wherein bodies weigh only
according to altitude. The second is, when VVater is
not counterpoised by VVater, or by Mercury, or by
Air, or by any other Fluid; but when 'its weighed by a
piece of <hi>Lead</hi> or stone in an <hi>Artificial Ballance,</hi> for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how many ounces or pounds it is of, as if a man should
endeavour to weigh the Water E F R by help of the
Ballance above, which in effect is impossible.</p>

while he is in going down. The precise quantity and weight
of it cannot be determined; because it depends upon the
quantity of the <hi>Ark,</hi> which if large, requires a great weight:
if of a lesser size, requires a lesser weight. But whatever
the dimensions of the <hi>Ark</hi> may be, the weight of the
<hi>Leaden-foot-stool</hi> can easily be found out by trial. This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
then, is for <hi>Diving,</hi> a most excellent Art, for lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of <hi>Guns, Ships,</hi> or any other things, that are drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
below the Water. And it is in imitation of the <hi>Div<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bell,</hi> already found out, and made use of with success.
It is called a Bell, because of the form, that represents a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:106992:97"/>
Church-bell indeed, being round, wide below, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
in the top: only, the matter is of Lead. It seems,
it is of this mettal, first, because Lead is weighty, and will
therefore easily sink: secondly, because it's easily founded,
and will by this means, being of one piece, be free of rifts,
and leaks: thirdly, it being of Lead, will be of a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
strength for resisting the force of the VVater, that
ordinarily breaks in pieces Vessels that are weak. I cannot
well divine and guess the reason, why first it is round, and
next narrower above, than below, unless, because its more
easily founded after this way, than after another. This
device here described is named a <hi>Diving Ark;</hi> first, because
it is of Timber, and next, because it saves a man from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overwhelmed with the Waters. I prescribe it of <hi>Wood,</hi>
because of less trouble, and expence in making of it. 'Tis
four square, because it contains under this Figure, far more
Air, than if it were round; even as much more, as a square
Vessel 30 inches wide, contains more than a round Vessel
30 inches wide. Now, the more Air, that's in the Vessel,
the easier is the respiration, and the longer time is the man
able to abide under the VVater, which two things are of
great advantage to this Art. For if by a guess we reckon,
how much more Air is in the one, than in the other, we will
find in the <hi>Ark,</hi> as before it is described, 30 square foot of
Air, but in the <hi>Bell,</hi> though it be 36 inches wide, as well
above, as below, yet little more than 23 will be found,
which is a considerable difference. But far less must be in
it, seing it's narrower above, than below. Besides this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
there are others very useful: for being of Wood,
it's more tractable. Next, several Knags of Iron may be
fastened conveniently to the sides within, to which a man
fastning his hands, may keep his body fixed and sure in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:106992:97"/>
down, and coming up. Moreover, if a man were in
hazard to be confounded with fear, or lose the right exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of his senses, and so be in danger of falling out of the
<hi>Ark;</hi> or if his feet should slide off the <hi>foot-stool,</hi> and his
hands fail him too, a chord knit to one of those, and fasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about his wast or middle, might bring him up, though
he were dead. Then, its far easier to cut out a window or
two in the sides of it, not very large, but little, as K and
I, whereby, they being covered with Glass, a man may see
at a distance, what's upon the right hand, and what's upon
the left, and what is before. This device is of excellent
use, for through the want of it, the <hi>Diver</hi> sees no more, but
what is just below him, which sometimes, when he is near
the ground, will not exceed the compass of a large Mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheel.
But if so be, three holes be cut thorow, one on
every hand, and one before, he may see as much bounds, and
all things in it, as if he were not inclosed, and invironed with
a cover. A little schelf likewise may be fixed upon the
one side or the other, for holding a Compass with a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical
Needle, for knowing how such and such a thing lies
in the ground of the Sea. In one of the corners may hing a
little bottle with some excellent spirits, for refreshing the
stomach, under VVater. Many moe advantages I
might name, this Engine being of Timber, but shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear;
leaving the collection of them to the ingenious
Reader, and proceeds to answer some objections, that may
be made against it.</p>
               <p>First, if this Engine be made of Wood, it will not sink
so easily, as being made of Lead. I answer, this difficulty
is soon overcome, namely by making the <hi>Foot-stool</hi> the
heavier: therefore how light soever it be, a weight may
be found to counterpoise it in the VVater. If it be judged
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:106992:98"/>
too light in Timber, it may be lined with Lead, especially
without. Secondly, if it be of VVood, there must be
couplings and joynings in it, and so rifts and leaks in it,
through which the VVater may come. I answer, there
is less difficulty here, than in the former; because the
joynts may be made so closs in all the parts, and may be so
covered over with pitch, or with some such like matter,
that it may defie either Water to come in, or Air to go
out. Thirdly, if it be made of VVood, it will be in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of breaking by the force of the VVater: for oft times
its found, that the strongest <hi>Hogshead</hi> will burst asunder by
the Pressure of it, if they go but down 7 or 8 fathom.
I answer, this objection flows from the ignorance of the
nature of Fluid bodies. If so be then, that a man knew,
that the Pressure of VVater is uniform, most equal, and
presseth upon all the parts of a body within it alike, no
such scruple would occurre. I say then, the Ark, though
no thicker in the sides, than a thin sawen dale, will go
down, in spight of all the Pressure that's in the VVater,
not only 10, but 20, or 30 fathom, without all hazard.
And the reason is, because what Pressure soever is without,
to press in the sides, the same degree of Pressure is within
to press them out. By this means, there is not one part
of the VVater, how deep soever, to which the <hi>Ark</hi> may
come down, but there will be found as much force in the
Air within, as will counterballance the whole weight with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
as will be infallibly demonstrated afterwards. This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
a fourth objection, namely if holes be cut out in the
sides of the Ark, in stead of windows, the force of the VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will break the Glasses in pieces, that covers them. There
is here no hazard, though the said windows were 12 inches
in Diameter: but its not needful they be so large. It's suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:106992:98"/>
if they be 2 inches wide: for a mans eye near to
a hole, 2 inches wide, will see a great way about him.
There's a necessity the Glasses be joyned in with cement,
that Water may not have access to come in, or Air to go
out. In such a case ther's no hazard, that the Pressure of
the VVater, will break through the windows, or break
the Glasses; because the Pressure of the Air within, being
of the same force with the strength of the VVater without,
the Glasses are keeped intire. It may be enquired, what
hazard would follow, upon supposition a small hole were
pierced in the head of the Ark above, when it is going
down? I answer, ther's not so much hazard, as a man
would think; provided the hole be not wide, but narrow.
If it be wide, not only the VVater comes in, but the Air
goes out, the one thrusting it self by the other. If the hole
be no wider, than the point of a bodkin is in thickness;
ther's no danger at all: for by reason of the strait passage;
the one cannot thrust it self by the other, and therefore
neither the VVater can come in, nor the Air go out. And
this comes to pass, by reason, that the Air within, is as
strong as the Water is without. Now, if they be both of
the same strength and force, why ought the Air rather to
go out, then the Water to come in; or the Water rather
to come in, then the Air to go out? I am confident,
though the hole were as wide, as a man might thrust in his
little finger, yet no irruption of Water, or eruption of Air
would follow. This demonstrats clearly, that though a
small rift, or leak should happen in the <hi>Ark,</hi> yet no haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
or danger would follow thereupon. If it be inquired,
whither the greatest hazard is from the ingress of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or from the egress of the Air? I answer, ther's no
danger from the coming in of the Water from above; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:106992:99"/>
as it comes in, it falls down, and so mingles with the
rest below. But if the Air should go out, the <hi>Ark</hi> fills pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
full of Water, and drowns the man that is in it.</p>
               <p>The next thing considerable in this <hi>Diving Instrument,</hi>
is the foot-stool of Lead C D, that's not only useful for a
man to set his feet upon, when he dives; but especially
for sinking of the <hi>Ark.</hi> For this being made of Timber;
and full of Air, cannot of 'its own accord go down, unless
it be pulled, and forced by some weight. It may either
be broad and round, or square: if square, a large foot over
from side to side, or 16 inches will determine the breadth.
By this means, it will happen to be pretty thick, seing a
great quantity of Lead is required. In each corner, there
must be a hole, for four chords, by which it is appended to
the mouth of the <hi>Ark.</hi> Between it, and the roof within,
must be the height of a man and more. The weight of
it, cannot be well determined without trial; seing it
depends upon the dimensions of the Ark. First then try,
how much weight, will bring the top E F G H level with
the surface of the Water. When this is found, add a
little more weight till it begin to sink, and this will surely
take it to the ground, though it were 40 fathom. 'Tis to
be observed, that when the top E F is level with the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
there is here a just counterpoise, namely between the
<hi>Lead foot-stool</hi> on the one part, as a <hi>pondus,</hi> and the <hi>Ark</hi>
on the other part, as a <hi>potentia;</hi> for with what force the
<hi>Ark</hi> endeavours to pull up the <hi>Lead;</hi> with the same force
strives the <hi>Lead</hi> to pull down the <hi>Ark.</hi> Hence it is, that
as a small weight will turn a pair of Scales, when they
are in <hi>equilibrio;</hi> so a small weight added to the <hi>foot-stool</hi>
will sink the <hi>Ark.</hi> Though it may seem difficult to
determine the just weight of the foot-stool, without trial
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:106992:99"/>
as I said, yet I purpose to essay it. For this cause con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that there is no Vessel of VVood almost, if it be once
full of Water, but the orifice of it will ly level with the
surface of the VVater, wherein it sweems. This propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
is so evident from experience, that it needs no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.
From this I gather, that as much weight of
Lead or Stone will bring the top of the Ark E F G H,
level with the surface of the VVater, as is the weight of
the Water, that fills it. If you suppose then the Ark
to be 36 inches broad, and 40 inches high, it must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
30 cubique foot of Water. Now, supposing each
square foot of this Water to weigh 56 pound, 30 foot
must weigh 1680 pound. This is gathered from trial
and experience, for after exact search, I found a cubique
foot of Water, in bulk about 16 pints of our measure, to
weigh 56 pound. Take then a piece of Lead of that
weight, and you will find it make a just counterpoise with
the Ark. If any be desirous to know the quantity of it.
I answer, if lead be 13 times naturally heavier then Water,
you will find that a piece of Lead about 16 inches every
way will do it. If it be objected, that when a mans body
is within the Ark, the weight of the foot-stool must be
less, even as much less, as is the weight of the man, whom
I suppose to weigh 224 pound, or 14 stone. I answer,
the whole weight of the man is not to be deduced from
the foot-stool, but the one half only, and the reason is,
because a mans body being of the same specifick and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
weight with Water, it cannot preponderat or weigh
in VVater, because magnitudes only naturally heavier
then VVater weigh in VVater, as Lead, or Stone;
therefore seing the one half of the man is within the Ark,
and the other without among the Water, that part only
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106992:100"/>
must weigh, that's invironed with Air. This may seem
a plausible answer, and might do much to satisfy these, that
are not very inquisitive, yet, being examined, it will be
found unsufficient. Therefore, I say, there's not one part
of the mans body, that weighs within the Ark, or makes
it heavier. Yet, I affirm, that when the mans body is
within the Ark, a less weight will sink it, then when his
body is out of it, even as much less than before, as is the
just weight of the one half of the man. For example, if
1680 pound be the just counterpoise of it without the
Man, then after the Man is in it, it will take only
1568 pound to counterballance it, supposing the one
half of the man to weigh 112 pound, or seven stone: yet
it is not the weight of the man that makes this difference.
For understanding what's the cause of this alteration, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that when a mans body is within the Ark, there is less
Air in it, then while his body is out of it, even as much
less in quantity, as the bulk of the parts are, that are
within. If this be, then must the Ark become heavier,
not because the mans body makes it heavier, but because
there is less Air, in the Ark, then before, and therefore,
there arises an inequality between the weight of the foot-stool
and the weight, or rather lightness of the Ark. For
if 1680 pound of Lead, was the just counterballance of it,
when it had 30 cubique foot of Air within it, it must
exceed, when there is less Air in it. But there occures,
here two difficulties, the first is, what's the reason, why as
much weight must be deduced from the foot-stool, as is the
the precise weight of the one half of the man? Secondly,
how shall we come to the true knowledge of that weight;
that is, to know distinctly how many pounds or ounces it
is of? For answer, let us suppose, that the one half of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:106992:100"/>
the man, is just as heavy, as so much Water equal in bulk
to his own half. This may be granted without scruple,
seing a mans body is judged to be of the same specifick,
and natural weight with Water: and though there should
be some small difference, yet it will not make, or produce
any insufficiency in the argument, for these demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
are not Mathematical but Physical. Therefore, as
much Water in bulk, as is equal to that part of the man,
that is within the Ark, must be as heavy, as the half of
the man. Now supposing the half of the man, to weigh
112 pound, and consequently that Water, to weigh
as much, I affirm the said Water to contain 3456
cubique inches: but 3456 cubique inches, makes exactly
two cubique feet, which I gather thus. Seven pound of
Water requires 216 cubique inches, because a Cube of
six inches, weighs exactly seven pound, therefore accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the rule of proportion, 112 pound will require
3456 inches, which amounts to two cubique foot. The
Ark then by receiving the one half of the mans body,
loseth two cubique foot of Air, therefore if 30 foot of Air,
require 1680 pound weight of Lead to counterpoise it,
28 foot of Air, must require only 1568 pound: therefore
to make a new counterballance, you must deduce 112
pound from the foot-stool. This answers both the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.
If it be said, that the foot-stool weighs less in
VVater than in Air, therefore it must be heavier, then
1680 pound. I answer, 'tis needful to abstract from that
difference, till the just calculation be once made, and
that being now done, I say, that a Cube of Lead 16
inches weighing 1680 pound, (If Lead be 13 times
heavier than VVater,) will lose about 130 pound. The
reason is evident, because a heavy body weighs as much
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:106992:101"/>
less in VVater than in Air, as is the weight of the
Water it expells. But so it is, that a Cube of Lead
of 16 inches expells a Cube of VVater 16 inches:
But a Cube of VVater 16 inches weighs 130 pound,
which I gather thus. 216 inches, or a Cube of six inches,
weighs seven pound, therefore 4032 inches, must weigh
130 pound. For if 216 give 7,4032 must give 130. But
to return. Though there be small difficulty to let it
down and to sink it 20 or 30 fathom, yet there is no small
difficulty to pull it up again. And the reason is this,
because the further down it goes, the Air within, is the
more contracted, and thrust up, by the Pressure of the
Water, towards the roof. By this means, though near the
top of the Water, there was little difference between the
weight of the <hi>Lead</hi> and the <hi>Ark;</hi> yet 9 or 10 fathom down,
the difference is great, the weight of the one, far exceeding
the weight of the other, and therefore there must be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
difficulty to pull it up from 10 fathom, than from 5: and
yet more difficulty from 20 than from 10. However,
yet 'tis observable that, as the <hi>Ark</hi> in going down, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
heavier and heavier, so in coming up, it growes
lighter and lighter: therefore less strength is required, in
pulling it up from the tenth to the fifth fathom, than
from the fifteenth, to the tenth: the reason is, because
in coming up, the Air within expands it self, and fills
more space in the Ark, which in effect makes it lighter,
and more able to overcome the weight of the <hi>Lead.</hi> To
make these things more evident, let us suppose, that when
the <hi>Ark</hi> is down 18 or 20 fathom, the Air to be contracted
by the force of the Water, from L M to P Q 12 inches.
Next, that the weight of the <hi>foot-stool</hi> is 1680 pound.
Now, if this weight was the just counterpoise of the <hi>Ark,</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:106992:101"/>
at the top of the Water, then surely it must far exceed
it now, when it's 20 fathom down, because the Air that
was 30 foot, is now reduced to 21. Count then, and you
will find, that if 30 require 1680, 21 will only require
1176: therefore the weight of the <hi>Lead,</hi> will exceed the
weight of the <hi>Ark,</hi> at 20 fathom deep, by 504 pound.
This will be yet more evident, if we consider, that while
the top of the Ark E F G H, is level with the surface
above, the VVater thrust out of 'its own place by this
bulk, is just the weight of both <hi>Lead</hi> and <hi>Ark.</hi> But
when 'its down 20 fathom, and the Air reduced from L M
to P Q, there cannot be so much VVater expelled now
as before, seing the space L M P Q is full of VVater.
Now, I say, the <hi>Lead</hi> at 20 fathom, must be exactly so
much heavier than the <hi>Ark,</hi> as is the weight of the said
VVater L M P Q, which in effect will be 504. pound:
for 'its a square body, 36 inches in thickness and 12 in
deepness. The weight of the rope is likewise to be
considered, that lets down the <hi>Ark:</hi> for the longer it be,
and more of it goes out, it's the heavier, and more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to pull up.</p>
               <p>There is no way to cure this difficulty, but by finding
out a way, how to keep a just counterpoise between the
<hi>Lead</hi> and the Ark, all the time it is in going down. If
the Air within did not contract it self, no difference would
happen: but this is impossible, so long as the Water is
under a Pressure. The expedient then must be found out
another way, namely by kniting a small rope to the iron
ring N, in length with the other, to which at certain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
relating to the fathoms the <hi>Ark</hi> goes down, must
be fastned empty little Vessels of Wood, or bladders,
which by their lightness, may compense the decrement
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:106992:102"/>
and decreasing of the Air. First then, let down the <hi>Ark</hi>
three fathom, and see how much it is heavier than before:
and as you find the difference, so fasten to R one Bladder,
or two, till the <hi>Ark</hi> be brought near to a counterpoise.
Secondly, let it go down other three fathom, and observe
that difference also, and accordingly fasten to T as many,
as will reduce the two to a counterpoise again. Do after
this manner, till it sink 15 or 20 fathom. 'Tis to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that the further down the Ark goes, the difference
is the less: therefore less addition will serve: and the
reason is, because there is less Air contracted, in passing
between the fifth and the tenth fathom; than in passing
from the first to the fifth. The proportion of contraction
is represented by the unequal divisions within the mouth
of the Ark, as 1. 2. 3. 4. In a word, by what propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the decrement of the Air is, by that same proportion
must the addition be, upon the rope S N. Suppose then,
the Air to be diminished four inches, in going down four
fathom, which will be 5184 square inches, or three square
foot, then surely as much Air must be added to the rope
S N, by bladders. In going down as far, let us suppose
three-inches to be contracted; then less will suffice. Though
it cannot be determined without trial, how much Air is
contracted in three fathom, and how much in six, and
how much in nine; yet this is sure, that the decreasing is
according to unequal divisions, that's to say, less in six
than in four, less in 8, than in six, and less in 10, than in
8, and so downward: and that this is the rule, namely
according to what quantity, the Air within the Ark is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
according to that same measure, must the addition
of Air be to the rope. If it be said, that Bladders full of
wind, cannot go down thorow the VVater without burst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106992:102"/>
I answer, 'tis a mistake, because their sides being
pliable, and not stiff like the sides of a Timber Vessel,
they yeeld, and therefore cannot burst. It's observable
that when a bladder goes far down, the sides becomes
flaccid and flagging. In this case, the Air, that before,
had the forme of the Bladder, and was somewhat ovall,
must now become perfectly globular, and round: for 'tis
sure, that the dimensions of it are altered by the Pressure
of the VVater, namely from more quantity to less: if this
be, then the form must be round, seing the Pressure of the
Water is most uniform; even as drops of VVater, or
Rain from a house side are round upon this account. This
second way, may be thought upon also. Make the <hi>Leaden
foot-stool</hi> that sinks the <hi>Ark,</hi> not of one piece, but of many,
that so, when the Air within it, begins to be contracted
by degrees, in going down, a proportionable weight may
be subtracted, for keeping a just counterpoise, all the
while of the descent. Or because the greatest trouble is
in bringing of it up, let the <hi>Diver,</hi> when once he is at the
bottom, subtract so much weight from the foot-stool, as
he thinks will go near to make a counterpoise, at that
deepness. For example, if the weight of the foot-stool
be 40 pound heavier than the Ark, then let him subtract
30 or 36, which may ly, and rest upon the ground, till
it be drawen up, at a convenient time, by a chord. By
his means it will be easie to move the <hi>Ark,</hi> from one place
to another. Next, there shall be little or no difficulty to
pull it up. Nay, upon supposition, the rope were broken,
by which it was let down, yet if the <hi>Diver</hi> please, he may
come up without any mans help. And this is most easily
done, namely by subtracting as much weight, as will make
the Ark the stronger party. 'Tis to be observed, that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:106992:103"/>
when you are at the bottom, and if you make the <hi>Lead</hi> but
one pound lighter than the <hi>Ark,</hi> it will surely come up,
and cannot stop by the way. The reason is, because a
very small weight will turn the Scales, between two bodies,
thus weighing in VVater. Next, the further the <hi>Ark</hi>
comes up, it becomes the lighter, because the Air within
it, expands it self the more. But leaving this, let us come
to explicat the reason, why the contraction of the Air
is not uniform, but rather difform. For if in going down
three fathom, three inches be contracted, there will not
be other three contracted in going down the second three,
but less: and yet less in going down the third three. Two
things then are to be explicated here. First, why there
is a contraction. Next, why it is after such a manner.
As for the first; the contraction is caused by the Pressure
of the Water, which gradually increaseth from the top to
the bottom; as is clear from the last Experiment: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
there being a greater Pressure in a surface six
fathom deep, than in a surface three fathom deep, the Air
within the <hi>Ark,</hi> must be more contracted in passing
between the third and sixth, than in passing between the
first and third. When I say more contracted, the meaning
is, that more quantity is contracted to less, whereby the <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi>
of it is more intended; or that the Air is more bended.
As for the second, we must remember from the last Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
that the cause of this, is not from the VVater,
as if forsooth the Pressure of it, were according to unequal
proportion, but from the Air it self, whose kind and
nature it is, to suffer compression after such a way. 'Tis
evident in <hi>Wind-guns,</hi> whose second span of Air is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
with greater difficulty, than the first: and the third
with greater difficulty, than the second. 'Tis so with
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:106992:103"/>
all bodies endowed with Benfil: for ay the longer you
bend, you find the greater difficulty. As there is a great
disadvantage to the man that <hi>Dives,</hi> from the contraction
of the Air, so there is a great advantage to him, from this
manner and way of contraction; for if it were uniform,
according to the Pressure of the Water, then if three
fathom comprest three inches, six fathom ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
six inches, nine fathom nine inches, and so forward,
till by going down, either the whole Air, should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
to no inches, or else very little should remain for
respiration.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be taken notice of, is that all the
while, during the down going of the <hi>Ark,</hi> there is still equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of weight, between the <hi>Pondus</hi> of the Water, and the
<hi>Potentia</hi> of the Air, for with what degree of weight, the
Water presseth up the Air, with the same degree of force
and power, doeth the Air press down the Water. If this
were not, it would be impossible for a man to go down; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of pain. For when one part of a mans body, is less
prest than another, there ariseth a considerable pain, which
sometimes is intolerable, as is evident from the application
of <hi>Ventoso-glasses.</hi> This equality of weight, is the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
why respiration is so easie. Yet 'tis to be observed,
that a man cannot breath so easily in the <hi>Ark,</hi> under the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as above in the Air<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not because there is any inequality,
between the weight of the VVater, and the force of the
Air; but only because the quantity of it is little. For
when a man sucks in as much Air, as fills his lungs, the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
must be diminished: if this be, the Water must ascend
by proportion, though insensibly. When a man thrusts out
the same Air again, the quantity is increased; if this be,
then the Water must subside a little; both which cannot be,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:106992:104"/>
without difficulty, seing there is a sort of ebbing and flowing
both of the Air and of the Water, in every respiration. But
it rather seems (you say) that this difficulty flowes from
the strong, extraordinary bensil, that the Air is under. I
answer, as long as the pressure of a Fluid is uniform, though
in a high degree, yet there can be no trouble in respiration;
because with what force soever, it is driven in upon the lungs,
with the same force it is driven out again: therefore, though
the Air we live in, were as much again bended as it is, yet
(as is probable) we would find no more difficulty in breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
than now. There is one thing makes breathing easie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Water, in the Ark, namely this; when a man sucks
in the Air to his lungs, his breast and belly goes out, and so
fills the space deserted by the Air, that goes in. This
makes the ebbing and flowing far less.</p>
               <p>From this equality of weight between the pressure of
the VVater, and the pressure of the Air, we see good
ground to say, that though the <hi>Ark,</hi> were no thicker in the
sides, than a thin sawed dale, yet there would be no haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
of breaking. I am confident, though it were no stronger
in the sides, than a wine-glass, that's soon broken; yet it
might go down 40 fathom without hazard, or danger of
bursting. This affords good ground likewise to make
windows in the Ark covered with glass: for if the Pressure
be uniform, and equal, its impossible they can be broken.
The VVater cannot thrust them inward, because the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Air, is as able to thrust them outward.</p>
               <p>It's certain, the more Air be in the Ark, the more easie
is respiration: therefore its more easie to breath, when
the Ark is but down 5 fathom, than when it is down 10 or
15. It's probable a man might live within the <hi>Ark,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
40 inches deep, and 36 inches wide, at the deepness of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:106992:104"/>
ten fathom, near two houres; whereas if it were round, and
narrow above in form of a Bell, he could not continue an
hour. It were very easie to try how long other creatures
might live in it, for example dogs, and such like, or fowls, as
hens, pheasants or doves. They might easily be inclosed from
coming out; for though the whole mouth of the Ark were
shut up, except as much passage, as would receive a mans
fist, yet it will operate, as well that way, as the other. And
there, a little door might be made to open, and shut at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
'Tis observed, that by long tarrying under the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the <hi>Bell,</hi> the Air becomes gross and misty, which
hinders a man from seing about him. The cause of this,
are vapors that come from the stomach, lungs and other
parts of the body, especially from the stomach, when the
<hi>ventricle</hi> is full of meat. It's not fit then, that a man about
to <hi>dive,</hi> should eat too much, or drink too much, especially
such liquors as <hi>Sack</hi> or <hi>Brandy,</hi> that beget many fumes and
vapors. If a man were necessitated to tarry a pretty while
below, fresh Air might be sent down from above, in bottles
or bladders, even as much as might fill up the place deserted
by the contracted Air. 'Tis observed by some, that have
been under the VVater, that their eares have been so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
that for a long time, they have found difficulty to
hear distinctly. The reason of this must be from the great
Pressure, the <hi>tympanum</hi> hath suffered from the imprisoned
Air of the <hi>Bell.</hi> The Organ of hearing is soon troubled,
especially when a man is near to a great <hi>gun,</hi> when it's fired.
And surely, when a man is but 34 foot down, the Air with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Ark, will be of double Bensil: put the case the man
go down 68 foot, or 13 or 14 fathom, the Bensil is tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled:
that's to say, if the Air above have five degrees of
Pressure in it, the Air of the <hi>Bell,</hi> at 68 foot deep, will
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:106992:105"/>
have 15 degrees of Pressure; therefore the <hi>tympanum</hi> of the
ear that's but a small and thin <hi>membran,</hi> must be sore
distressed; that is overbended, and prest inward; even
as, while a man sets upon a drum head a great weight,
v. g. a Bullet of Lead or Iron, of 20 or 30 pound, the skin
by this, suffers an extraordinary Pressure, whereby it is in
hazard to be rent. 'Tis probable, if a man should go very
far down, the <hi>tympanum</hi> might be in hazard of breaking, or
being rent in two pieces, there being a greater Pressure
upon the one side from the Air without, than upon the
other side, from the internal Air within, which is thought
to be within the <hi>tympanum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There remains another <hi>Phenomenon</hi> to be explicated, and
it's this: the further up the <hi>Ark</hi> comes from the ground of
the Water, towards the top, the Water within it, subsides
and settles down more and more, towards the mouth. The
reason of it is, because the further up, the Pressure of the
Water is the less; and therefore the contracted Air gets
liberty to expand, and dilate it self, and so thrusts down the
Water from P Q to L M. In a word, by what propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Air is contracted in going down, by that same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
it dilates, and opens it self in coming up. This
lets us see, as there is disadvantage in going down, from
the contraction of the Air, so there is advantage in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up, from the dilatation of it. Some think, that the
coldness of the Water is the cause, why the Air is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
in the Ark, such are those, who deny the Pressure
of it. But this fancy is easily refuted; because in assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, they must maintain, the further down, the cold
is the greater. If this be, then far more Air must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
in going down from 10 to 15 fathom, than in
passing from 5 to 10; seing as they say, the further down,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:106992:105"/>
the cold is the greater; and therefore the contraction of
the Air must be the greater; that's to say, there must be
more quantity of Air contracted in the one space, than in
the other. But so it is, that the further down, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
is the less. They judge likewise the coldness of
the Water to be the cause, why the sides of empty Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
are broken in going down. But if this be, then a
strong Vessel should go no further down than a weak Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel;
seing cold can pierce thorow the sides of the one, as
well as thorow the sides of the other. And why is it, that
a bladder full of wind will go down 40 or 50 fathom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
bursting, yea 100, and yet a stone-bottle or glass-bottle,
cannot go beyond 20 or 30? If cold have in it,
that power to break the sides of a strong bottle, it must be
far more able to burst the sides of a thin Bladder. This dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is clearly explicated from the Pressure of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
but I defy any man to shew the difference from the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it. 'Tis to be observed, that in all such Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of sinking of Vessels, as <hi>Hogs-heads, Barrels,</hi> and
<hi>Bottles,</hi> they must be closs on all sides. Therefore, if a man
desire to know, how far down a Glass-bottle is able to go
without bursting, he must stop the mouth of it exactly,
with a piece of wood, and cement.</p>
               <p>In setting down the dimensions of the <hi>Ark,</hi> I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricted
them to 40 inches high, and 36 inches wide.
But if any man be desirous to enlarge them, or make them
less, he may do it. Only 'tis to be observed, that the
larger the <hi>Ark</hi> be, the <hi>Foot-stool</hi> that sinks it, must be the
heav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er. Yet it hath this advantage, that it contains much
Air, which is the great perfection of it. One of a lesser
size hath this advantage, that it's more tractable, and easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to let down, and to be pull'd up. But these things are
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:106992:106"/>
best known from Experience, or if a man please, he may
calculate.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Ark</hi> is a most useful device for profit, so 'tis excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
for pleasure, and recreation, if a man were disposed to
see the ground and channels of deep VVaters, or were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to find out <hi>Hydrostatical</hi> conclusions, a knowledge
very profitable, and which few have attained to. Though
it seem somewhat difficult to enter the <hi>Ark,</hi> and go down
below the Water, yet a little use will expell all fear.
Then, a man may go down with less hazard, and fear in
the <hi>Ark,</hi> then in the <hi>Bell,</hi> because he may conveniently
fasten his hands, to each side of the Ark, if need were.
He may conveniently sit, as in a Chair, all the time of down
going, and up-coming, by fixing a little seat in it: he
may have windows to look out at: his body may be so
fixed, that there needs be no fear of falling out.</p>
               <p>If a man were desirous to make <hi>Hydrostatical</hi> conclusions,
by <hi>Diving</hi> under the VVater, the dimensions of the <hi>Ark</hi>
might be enlarged, so that it might conveniently cover
a mans whole body, by which means, having much Air
in it, a <hi>Diver</hi> might continue under Water half a day, if
need were. Let us suppose then, the hight of it to be 8
foot, and the breadth 3 foot, or more. In such a case, a
man might continue under the VVater many hours; and
yet not one part of his body wet: for if the <hi>Ark</hi> be 8 foot
high, and the man 5 foot in stature, at the deepness of
10 fathom, the Water can scarce rise 3 foot in it. But
why may not a man come up every half hour, when he
finds difficulty to tarry down in a little <hi>Ark?</hi> I answer, he
may; but it's trouble and pains to pull him up, and let him
down so frequently. And it may so happen, that through
want of Air in a small <hi>Ark,</hi> he be necessitated to come up
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:106992:106"/>
before he end his work. And leaving the work imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
he may find difficulty in the second down going, to
find sometimes the place where he was, or the thing he was
about to lift, <hi>v. g.</hi> a chest of Gold. If it be said, that
a great weight of Stone or Lead is required to sink an
Ark 8 foot high, which will amount to 4032 pound
weight. I answer, 'tis so indeed: but here is the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
when it is once below the Surface, there's little more
trouble, then with an Ark of lesser dimensions; because of
the <hi>equipondium</hi> that's between it, and the weight, that
sinks it.</p>
               <p>In such a Vessel many trials might be made. As first,
that of the <hi>Torricellian-Experiment,</hi> which is nothing else,
but a Glass-Tub so many inches long, with a <hi>Mercurial</hi>
Cylinder in it of 29 inches high, that's supposed to be
kept up at that hight by the Pressure of the Air. If this
were taken down about 34 foot, 'tis very probable the
Mercury would rise other 29 inches. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Air within the Ark, that presseth upon the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the stagnant Mercury, must be under as much pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
again, as the Air above; but the Air above, is able
to support 29; therefore this Air must sustain 58. The
reason why the Bensil is exactly doubled is this, 34
foot of Water hath exactly as much Pressure in it, as the
whole element of Air; therefore, the Air within the Ark,
being 34 foot down, must not only have in it the Pressure
of the Air above, but the Pressure of the Water likewise:
this necessarily follows, because when two Fluids touch,
or are contiguous to other, the one cannot be under five
degrees of Pressure, unless the other be under as many.
According to this reasoning, if the <hi>Ark</hi> go down 68 foot,
the Mercury will rise from 58 to 87. If to 102, it rises
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:106992:107"/>
116. This reckoning is founded upon this, namely that
Water is 14 times lighter than Mercury; and therefore
one inch of Mercury requires 14 of Water to support it
in a Tub, and therefore, before Water is able to raise 29
inches of it, the Pipe must be 34 foot deep.</p>
               <p>For a second trial, blow a Bladder as full of wind as it
can hold, and having knit the neck about with a Pack-threed,
place it in the <hi>Ark,</hi> and you will find the sides,
that hath been stifly bended become flaccid and feeble, as
if the one half of the Wind had gone out, and this will
come to pass, before the <hi>Ark</hi> can go down eight or nine
fathom. The strong bensil of the Air within the Ark is
the cause of this: for as the Ark goes down, the Air
grows stronger, and so at length becomes of that power and
force, that it easily overcomes the force and Bensil of the
Air of the Bladder, and reducing it to less room, causes
the sides become flagging. In this case, the said Air,
that was oval, and had the form of the Bladder, must
become round in form of a Globe, because of the uniform
Pressure, that it suffers from the Air of the <hi>Ark.</hi> When
once the <hi>Ark</hi> is down 14 or 15 fathom, take the same
bladder, and blow it stiff with Wind, and knit the neck
as afore. And you will find that in the up-coming, the
sides of it will burst asunder with a noise. When the
Bladder is thus full of Wind, 'tis supposed, that there is
a sort of counterpoise between it, and the Air of the <hi>Ark.</hi>
But as the <hi>Ark</hi> ascends, the Air of it, becomes weaker
and weaker, while in the mean time, the Air of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
suffers no relaxation; therefore, when the <hi>Ark</hi> comes
near the surface, there arises a great disproportion between
the one Air and the other, as to strength, and therefore
the Air of the Bladder being the strongest, rents the sides
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:106992:107"/>
in pieces, and comes out with a noise. Or, blow it
but half full of wind, and you will find before, the Ark
come near to the top, the said Bladder to be bended to
the full.</p>
               <p>For a third trial, take a Glass, such as they use in
<hi>Caves,</hi> for preserving of Brandy, and stopping the mouth
closely, take it down with you in the <hi>Ark;</hi> and you will
see, the sides of it break in pieces, before you go down
four or five fathom. The strong Bensil of the ambient
Air, is the cause of this. If you take it down with the
orifice open, no hurt shall befal it. Or if you stop the
orifice in the up-coming, you will find the same hurt
come to it. But here is the difference, in the first burst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the sides are prest inward, by the ambient Air; in
the second, the sides are prest outward, by the Air with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Glass.</p>
               <p>For a fourth trial, take a round Glass-bottle, pretty
strong in the sides, and when it is down with you in the
<hi>Ark</hi> 14 or 15 fathom, stop the mouth of it exactly, and
when it comes above, you will find a considerable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Wind come out of it, when the orifice is opened.
This evidently demonstrats, that the Air within the
Ark, 12, 13, or 14 fathom down, is under a far stronger
Bensil then the Air above.</p>
               <p>For a fifth trial, let a man apply to his skin a cold
<hi>Cupping-Glass,</hi> when he enters the Ark; and he will
find such a swelling arise within it, as when it is applied
hot by a Chyrurgion. This tumor begins to rise, assoon
as the <hi>Ark</hi> begins to go down. The reason is evident
from unequal Pressure, the parts within the Glass being
less prest, than the parts without.</p>
               <p>For a sixth trial, take a common <hi>Weather-Glass,</hi> and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:106992:108"/>
Place it in the <hi>Ark,</hi> and in the going down, you will see
the liquor creep up in it, by degrees, as the <hi>Ark</hi> goes
down, as if some extraordinary cold, were the cause of
it. And as the <hi>Ark</hi> comes up by degrees, the said
liquor creeps down by degrees. The cause of this <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon</hi>
is not cold, as some might judge, but the strong
Bensil of the Air within the Ark, that so presseth upon
the surface of the stagnant Water, that it drives it up.
If you take with you, a <hi>Weather-Glass, hermetically</hi>
sealled, no such thing will follow; because the outward
Pressure is keeped off. 'Tis not then cold, that's the
cause, but weight. By the way take notice, that all
common <hi>Weather-Glases</hi> are fallacious and deceitful;
because the motion of the Water in them, is not only
caused by heat, but by the weight of the Air, which
sometimes is more, and sometimes less, as frequently I
have observed, and as hath been observed by others.
This difference is found, by the alteration of the altitude of
the Mercurial cylinder, in the <hi>Baroscope,</hi> which is more and
less, as the Pressure of the Air changeth. In fair weather,
and before it comes, the Mercury creeps up. In foul and
rainy weather, and a pretty while, before it fall out, it
creeps down. Because in fair weather, the weight of
the Air is more, than in rainy and dirty weather. <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
13. 1669. I found the altitude 29 inches, and nine
ten parts of an inch: at this time the heavens were cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with dry and thick clouds, and no rain followed.
<hi>March</hi> 26. 1670. I found the altitude no more, than 27
inches, and nine ten parts, at which time, there was a
strong Wind with rain. Between these two termes of
altitude, I have found the Mercury move near a twelve
moneth. 'Tis a most sure prognosticator, for if after
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:106992:108"/>
rain, you find the Mercury creep up in the morning, you
may be sure, all the day following will be fair, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that the heavens threateneth otherwayes. If
after fair weather, the Mercury subside, and fall down a
little, you may be sure of rain within a short time, though
no appearance be, in the present. It falls down likewise,
when winds do blow. What the true cause is, why there
is such an alteration in the Pressure of the Air, before foul
weather, and fair, and in the time of it, it is not easie to
determine.</p>
               <p>But we proceed. Trial likewise might be made, by
fiting a great piece of Ordnance above, whether the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
would be heard below the Water or not? This
would determine the question, whether Water be a fit
<hi>medium</hi> for conveying sound as Air is. Item, whether or
not, the Sea water be fresher at the bottom, than near the
top, which is affirmed by some. Item, whether sounds
be as distinct in such a small portion of Air, as they are
above. This might be tried with a Bell of a Watch. If
need were, a little chamber Bell might be hung within the
<hi>Ark,</hi> and a small chord might pass up from it, through the
cover, whereby the persons above, might by so many
tingles, speak such and such words to the <hi>Diver.</hi> I have
demonstrated before, that though there were a little nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
hole made in the cover above, yet neither Air would
go out, nor Water come in. If a man were curious, he
might have a window not only in the sides, but in the roof
above, covered with a piece of pure thin Glass, thorow
which he might look up, after he is down two or three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom,
and see whether there appeared any alteration in
the dimensions of the body of Sun or not, or seemed
nearer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:106992:109"/>
We now come to infer some <hi>Hydrostatical</hi> conclusions,
as from former Experiments. We see then first, that in
Water there is a pressure; namely from the strong <hi>Bensil</hi>
of the Air within the <hi>Ark,</hi> that groweth stronger, and
stronger, as the Water groweth deeper, and deeper. We
see next, that the pressure of the VVater hath an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
because the further down the <hi>Ark</hi> goeth, the Air
is the more bended. Thirdly, two Fluids cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous
one to another, unless both of them be under the
same degree of pressure: because the Air of the <hi>Ark,</hi> and
the Water that creepeth up within the mouth of it, are
perpetually under the same degree of power, and force,
whatever the deepness be. Fourthly, that in Fluids the
pressure is uniform; because the Air of the <hi>Ark,</hi> and the
Water without, press most equally, one against the other.
Fifthly, the more that the Air is bended, it is the more
difficult to bend it; and consequently, that the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the quantity, is according to <hi>unequal proportion.</hi>
Sixthly, that when the <hi>Ark</hi> is down 34 foot, the <hi>Bensil</hi>
of the Air is doubled: and tripled, when its down 68
foot: because the pressure of 34 foot of VVater, is as
much as the whole pressure, that's from the <hi>Atmosphere.</hi>
If it be enquired, how much weight rests upon the palm
of a mans hand, when the <hi>Ark</hi> is down about 68 foot?
I answer, the pressure of the Water upon a mans hand,
at that deepness with the pressure of the Air above, will
be equivalent to the weight of a pillar of Mercury 87 inches
high, and three inches thick, which will exceed in real
weight 200 pound. If so much rest upon the palm, how
much must rest upon the rest of the parts of the body?
Let us suppose then, the quantity of the palm, to be found
in a mans skin, 200 times, then must he suffer as much
<pb facs="tcp:106992:109"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:106992:110"/>
                  <figure/>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:106992:110"/>
pressure, and actually support as much burden, as will
amount to 40000 pound weight. Seventhly, our bodies
may be under a huge pressure, and yet that burden not
perceptible; as is evident from the <hi>Diver,</hi> who findeth
little or no weight, while he is under the Water. Or if
there be any Pressure found, it's not comparable to that,
which really is. Eighthly, when a man is 14 or 15 fathom
down, at every inspiration and expiration, his breast and
belly must lift up the weight of 1800 pound: because, if
the whole burden be 40000, the weight that rests upon
the breast, and belly, will be about 1800. Ninthly, that
between every inspiration, and expiration, there happens
a perfect counterpoise, namely by the Air, that goeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the lungs, and the outward Air of the <hi>Ark:</hi> for if the
Pressure of the one, were more, than the Pressure of the
other, there could be no motion of the lungs. Tenthly,
when a man draweth his breath, the Air cometh not in by
<hi>suction,</hi> but by <hi>pulsion.</hi> For this cause, though the
VVind-pipe were stopped, yet a man might live by having
a hole in his side, going into the lungs. Lastly, that
there is no such thing as <hi>suction</hi> properly; and therefore
the motion of all Fluid bodies, is caused by Pressure and
weight. The motion of the blood then thorow the heart,
is <hi>driven,</hi> and not <hi>sucted.</hi> Infants properly do not suck,
but have the milk squeezed into their mouth. 'Tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from the sucking-glass that some women use for milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their own breasts: for by help of this, the Air that
guardeth the head of the Pap is removed, and so the Air,
that presseth the parts about, and without, squeezes out the

Figure 26.</head>
               <p>THis Figure represents a deep Water, whose first and
visible surface, is F G. The imaginary surface, is
E L C, 34 foot below it. A D B is a <hi>Siphon,</hi> working
below this VVater with Mercury. A E L is a Vessel with
stagnant Mercury, among which the orifice A is drowned,
the other orifice B existing among the Water, D M is
the hight of the <hi>Siphon</hi> above the line of level, which I
suppose is 58 inches. For making it work, stop the two
orifices closely, and pour in as much Mercury at a hole
made at D, as will fill both the legs. Then stopping the
said hole, open the two orifices A and B, and you will find
the liquor run as long out at B, as there is any almost in the
vessel A E L. For evincing this, which is the only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
consider, that if this <hi>Siphon,</hi> were filled with
Water, and made to work only with Air, (as is clear from
daily experience) the liquor would run out constantly at
B. Because there is here an unequal Pressure; the surface
of Air N B, being more burdened, than the surface E L C,
but where unequal Pressure is in Fluids (according to the
12th Theorem) motion must follow, I prove the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
N B to be more burdened, than the surface E L C,
because the Water B D, is heavier than the Water L D,
as is evident to the eye. The Air B therefore, sustaining
far more weight, than the Air E L, must cede and yeeld.
Next, there is here a <hi>pondus</hi> and a <hi>potentia,</hi> the <hi>pondus</hi> is
the VVater L D; the <hi>potentia</hi> by which it is counterpois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is the Water B D; but these are unequal, B D being
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:106992:111"/>
heavier, than L D; therefore according to the 33 Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,
these two Fluids cannot cease from motion. If it
be said, that the surface N B is stronger, than the surface
E L C, seing it is lower. I answer, the difference is so
unsensible, that they may be judged but one. Now, I
say, if this <hi>Siphon</hi> work in Air, with Water, it must
likewise, work in Water with Mercury. Therefore, this
<hi>Siphon</hi> being 34 foot below the first surface F G, the liquor
must run out constantly at B. Because, there is here, an
unequal Pressure, the surface of VVater N B, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng more
burdened, than the surface E L C. Though there be
more weight in N B, than in E L C, because it is lower,
yet because the difference is not so much, as is between the
weight of B D, and the weight of L D, it proves nothing.
Note here, that so long as D, is within 58 inches of E L
C, this <hi>Siphon</hi> will work. The reason is, because the
Pressure of 34 foot of VVater, with the Pressure of the
Air, upon F G, are able to raise Mercury exactly 58 inches.
But if D exceed that hight, no Art will make the liquor
run out at B. Note secondly, that this <hi>Siphon</hi> will ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
with Air and VVater, though the top D were 34
foot above M; and the reason is, because the Pressure of
the Air, is able to raise a pillar of Water to that hight.
Note thirdly, that if there were an orifice opened at C,
upon the level line E L C, the two Waters would become
of the same weight, the one not being able to move the
other. If you bore a hole at R, the liquor ascends from
R to D, and goeth down from D to A, and so the motion
ends. But, if the leg A D were six times wider, than
B D, the liquor would not run out at B. I shall answer
this in the close.</p>
               <p>From this Experiment we see first, that the motion of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:106992:112"/>
Fluid Bodies up thorow <hi>Pumps,</hi> and <hi>Siphons</hi> is not for
shuning <hi>vacuity,</hi> but because they are prest up violently.
We see next, that when the Pressure is uniform, there
is no motion in Fluids; but assoon, as one part is more
prest, than another, motion begins: because, this <hi>Siphon</hi>
will not operate, if the orifice be made in C; but if so be, it
be in D, then the motion begins; because there is here
an unequal Pressure, which was not in the other. We
see thirdly, that Fluids have a determinate <hi>Sphere</hi> of
<hi>activity,</hi> to which they are able to press, and no further:
because this Water, is not able to press Mercury higher
than 58 inches. So the Air cannot raise Water higher
than 34 foot. If this Water were 68 foot deep, the
<hi>Sphere</hi> of it's <hi>activity</hi> would be 116 inches. We see
fourthly, that in Fluids there is a <hi>Pondus</hi> and a <hi>Potentia;</hi>
and that the inequality of weight between the two, is the
only cause of motion. We see fifthly, that as long as
this inequality of weight continues, as long continues the
motion, because, as long as B D, is heavier than L D,
the motion perseveres. We see sixthly, the possibility
of a <hi>perpetual motion</hi> in Fluids; because the liquor runs
perpetually out at B. If it be said, the motion ends,
when the stagnant Mercury A E L faileth. I answer,
this stop is only accidental, and not essentially from the
nature of Fluids. If it be enquired, whether or not, would
the Mercury run out at B, upon supposition, the shank
L D were twice as wide, as the shank B D? I answer
it would. If it be said that the one is far heavier than the
other, namely L D than D B. I answer, weight in
Fluids is not counted according to thickness, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to altitude.</p>

Figure 27.</head>
               <p>THis last is for demonstrating the precise and just
weight of any Pillar of Air, Water, Mercury, or
of any other Fluid body, if some of their dimensions, be
but once knowen. A B then is a square Pipe 12 foot high,
and six inches in wideness, full of Water, resting upon
the surface of Air A C. And E G is a square Pipe 12 foot
high, and 12 inches wide, full of VVater, resting upon
the surface of Air E F. None needs to doubt, but
the two Waters, will be suspended after this manner,
even though the orifices A and E were downward, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if they be guarded with Water, but the demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
will be the more evident, that wee suppose the
two Pillars of Water to be suspended as they are. From
this Experiment I say first, that the Pillar of Air C D is
168 pound weight, at least; which I prove thus. The
VVater A B is 168 pound: therefore the Air C D, must
be as much. I prove the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> because it's a Pillar
of VVater 12 foot high, and six inches thick: but every
half cubical foot of VVater, that containes 216 inches,
weighs seven pound: therefore seing the Pillar is 12 foot,
it must contain 24 half feet; but 24 times 7 is 168. The
only difficulty is to prove the <hi>Connexion,</hi> which I do thus,
from the seventh Theor. <hi>all the parts of a Fluid in the same
Horizontal line, are equally prest,</hi> but so it is, that the
part A, and the part C, are in the same horizontal sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face;
therefore the part A, and the part C, are equally
prest. But if the part A, and the part C, be equally
prest, the Pillar of Air C D, must be as heavy, as the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:106992:113"/>
Pillar of VVater A B. I say secondly, that the Pillar
of Air F H, weighs 672 pound, I prove it thus. The
Water E G weighs 672 pound; therefore the Air F H,
weighs as much. The <hi>Antecedent</hi> is clear, because E G,
is a square Pillar of VVater 12 foot high, and 12 inches
thick; but every cubical foot of VVater weighs 56
pound: but 12 times 56, is 672. I prove the <hi>connexion,</hi>
as before. All the parts of an horizontal surface, are
equally prest; therefore the part F, must sustain as much
burden, as the part E.</p>
               <p>To proceed a little further, let us suppose the Pipe
A B to be 34 foot high, and the Pipe E G to be as
much. I assert then thirdly, the Pillar of Air C D to
weigh 476 pound, which I prove as before. All the
parts of the same surface, are burdened with the like
weight, but the part A sustains 476 pound, therefore the
part C must support as much. The <hi>Connexion</hi> is evident,
and the <hi>Antecedent</hi> is so too, because the VVater A B
being 34 foot high, and six inches thick, must weigh
476 pound: for, if 216 inches, weigh seven pound,
14688 inches, must weigh 476 pound. I assert fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Pillar of Air F H to weigh 1904 pound, which
I demonstrat by the former <hi>Medium.</hi> All the parts of a
Fluid that ly in the same horizontal surface, are equally
prest; but so it is, that E and F, do so ly; therefore F
must be as much burdened as E; the Water therefore E G,
weighing 1904 pound, the Air F H, must weigh as
much. For if 216 inches of Water weigh seven pound,
58752 inches (for so many are in the Water E G) must
weigh 1904 pound.</p>
               <p>Let us suppose secondly, the Tub A B to be only 29
inches high, and the Tub E G, of the same hight, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:106992:113"/>
that six inches wide, and this 12 inches wide. I affirm
then fifthly, the Air C D to weigh yet 476 pound, and
the Air F H, to weigh 1904 pound. Because the Pillar
of Mercury A B, weighs 476 pound, and the Pillar
of Mercury E G, weighs 1904 pound: therefore, if A B
be 476, C D must be as much. And if E G be 1904;
F H, must be of the same weight. I prove the Mercury
A B to weigh about 476 pound, though it be but 29
inches high; because it is 14 times heavier than Water.
For the same cause, doth the Mercury E G weigh about
1904 pound. I say <hi>about,</hi> because 34 foot, containes 29
inches, more than 14 times.</p>
               <p>Let it be supposed thirdly, the Pipe E G, (being 34
foot high,) to have the one half of it I G, full of Air, and
the other half E K full of VVater, I affirm then sixthly,
the part E, and the part F, to be yet equally burdened.
That's to say, the VVater E K, that's now but 17 foot,
makes as great a Pressure upon E, as when it was 34 foot.
The reason of this, is surely the Pressure of the Air I G,
that bears down the Water K E, with the weight of 952
pound, the half of 1904 pound. If it be said according
to the Theorem 21, that there is as much Pressure and
weight in the least part of a Fluid, as in the whole; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Air I G, must be as heavy as E H. I answer
I G, is not so heavy as F H, because the Water E K
impending in the lower part of the Tub, hath occasioned
the Air I G, to expand it self so many inches, by which
means, it loseth so many degrees of it's <hi>Bensil.</hi> If you
remove the Water E K, then will the Air I G, be as
heavy, as F H; because E K being Air, it reduceth
I G to that same degree of <hi>Bensil</hi> with it self; but when
the Air E is burdened with the Water E K, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:106992:114"/>
make the Air I G, of that same weight with it self.</p>
               <p>Let us suppose fourthly, that only eight foot and an
half of Water, are in the Tub, namely between E and N.
I say then seventhly, that the part E, is as much bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
with it, as when the Pipe was full; because the
25 foot, and an half of Air N G, is exactly as heavy,
as the 25 foot and an half of the Water that's gone. I
prove it thus. The Air E hath the weight of 1904 pound
in it self, seing the weight of the surface, is alwayes
equal to the weight of the Pillar, but being burdened
with the VVater E N, that weighs 476 pound, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
press up with more weight then with 1428 pound:
and therefore the top of the Water N, must press upon
the under part of the Air, that's contiguous with it, with
1428. If this be, the Air N G, must press down with
as much, seing according to the 20 Theorem, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
that one part of a Fluid, can be under Pressure,
unless the next adjacent part, be under the same degree
of Pressure. Therefore I conclude, that the 25 foot and
an half of Air N G, is as heavy, as the 25 foot and an
half of the Water that's gone. This makes it evident
also, that when the Pipe is half full of VVater, as E K,
the Air I G, hath the weight of 952 pound. Because E
being in it self 1904, but being burdened with E K 952,
it cannot make the top of the Water K, press upon I
with more weight than 952; and therefore (by the 20
Theorem,) the Air G I, must weigh 952 likewise.</p>
               <p>I affirm eighthly, that, when the Pipe is full of Water,
from E to G, if a man poise it in his hand, he doth not
find the weight of the Water E G. And the reason is,
because it's sustained by the part of the surface E. But
if the Air E sustain it, my hand cannot sustain it. I find
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:106992:114"/>
then only the weight of the Tub, but not the weight of
the VVater within it. I say ninthly, that when I poise
the said Tub, I find the whole weight of the Pillar of Air
L M, which is exactly 1904 pound. I prove it thus.
The <hi>pondus</hi> of a Fluid is then only found, when there is
not a <hi>potentia</hi> to counterpoise it, or at least, when the <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia</hi>
is inferior to the <hi>pondus:</hi> but there is here no <hi>poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
counterpoising the <hi>pondus</hi> of the Air L M. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I must find the weight of it, when I lift up the Tub.
The <hi>major proposition</hi> is clear from the tenth Theorem. It's
evident also, from common experience; for while a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
is hanging upon a nail, with six pound in the one
scale, and nothing in the other, you will find the whole
burden, if you press up that one scale with the palm of
your hand. But if so be, there were six pound in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
scale, you will not find the first six; and the reason
is, because it is in <hi>equilibrio</hi> with other six. 'Tis just so
here, I must find the weight of the Air L M, while I
poise the Tub, because it wants a weight to counterbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
it. I prove the <hi>minor proposition</hi> thus. If any thing
counterballance the Air L M, it must either be the Air
below, namely the part E; or the Water E G: but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the twain can do it. Not the Air E, because it
hath as great a burden upon it, as it is able to support,
namely the Water E G, that weighs 1904 pound. And
for this cause, not the VVater it self, seing all the force
it can have to counterballance L M, is from the surface of
Air E; but this is in <hi>equilibrio</hi> with it already. I said
that the Air L M, was exactly 1904 pound weight. This
also is evident, because it is just of these same dimensions,
with the Air F H. If it be said, the Air L M must be thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
seing it's equal to the Tub without; but the Air
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:106992:115"/>
F H, is only equal to the Tub within. I answer, it is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
but here is a solution to the difficulty. I do not
find the whole weight of the Air L M, but only as much
of it, as is equal to F H. Suppose the Tub to be 12 inches
within, from side to side, and 16 without, from side to
side. I say then, I find only the burden of so much Air,
as answers to the cavity of the Tub, because the rest of these
inches, are counterpoised, by as much below, namely by
the Air, that environs the orifice E: for it's supposed, that
if the Tub be two inches thick above, it must be as thick
in the lips. So that the whole Tub, is not unequally prest,
but only so much of it within upon the top, as answers to
the cavity. Tenthly, that when the Pipe is but half full
of VVater, namely from E to K, I find only 952 pound
of the Air L M, though before I found 1904. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because the one half of it is now counterpoised by
the Air I G, and therefore the weight of it becomes insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
'Tis clear from the sixth assertion, that the Air
I G, presseth down with 952; therefore it must press up
with as much, seing according to the sixth Theorem, the
Pressure of a Fluid is on every side. Eleventhly, that when
there is only eight foot of VVater and a half in the Tub,
namely between E and N; I find only 476 pound of the
Air L M. Because in this case, the Air N G counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiseth
1428 pound of it. For if the said Air, burden the
Water N E, with 1428 pound, as is clear from the seventh
assertion, it must likewise press up the Tub with as much,
and so counterpoise as much of the Air L M. Twelfthly,
that when there is nothing within the Pipe but Air, the
whole weight of the Air L M becomes insensible to me.
The reason is evident, because it is wholly counterpoised
by the Air within the Pipe. I affirm thirteenthly, that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:106992:115"/>
the VVater E G, is in <hi>equilibrio</hi> with the Water A B:
that's to say 1904 pound, is in <hi>equilibrio</hi> with 476 pound.
I prove it evidently, by the first <hi>medium;</hi> all the parts of
an Horizontal surface, are equally prest; therefore the
part A, sustains no more burden, then the part E, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
A B, is as heavy as E G, and consequently, the Air
C D, must be as heavy, as the Air F H. Lest this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
may seem to contradict what is already said, I must
distinguish a twofold Ballance, according to the third Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,
one <hi>Natural,</hi> another <hi>Artificial.</hi> In the <hi>Artificial
Ballance,</hi> where magnitudes do weigh according to all their
dimensions, <hi>viz. Longitude, Latitude,</hi> and <hi>Profundity,</hi> the
Water A B, and the Water E G, are not in <hi>equilibrio</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
seing the one is 1428 pound heavier than the other.
But in the <hi>Ballance</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> such as these Pipes are, all
the four makes an <hi>equipondium</hi> together; because they do
not weigh here, according to their <hi>thickness,</hi> but only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their <hi>altitude.</hi> Therefore seing A B is as high
as E G, and seing C D is as high as F H, they must all
be of the same weight.</p>
               <p>From the first assertion I infer, that one and the same
Fluid, even in the <hi>Ballance</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> may sometimes be
in <hi>equilibrio</hi> with a lesser weight, and sometimes with a
greater, because the Air C D, that weighs really 476
pound, is in <hi>equilibrio</hi> with the Water A B, that weighs
but 168. This is, when A B is supposed to be only 12
foot high. It's likewise in <hi>equilibrio</hi> with it, when its 34
foot high. But how can A B, that's 12 foot high, press
A, with as much weight, as when its 34 foot high? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
by a similitude, when a Cylinder of Wood 12 foot
high stands upon a Table, it may burden it as much, as if
it were a Cylinder 34 foot high. For, supposing it to be
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:106992:116"/>
thrust in, between it, and <hi>v. g.</hi> the ceiling of the room
above, it must press down with more weight, then if it
were not thrust in. So, this Cylinder of Water A B,
that's but 12 foot high, being prest between the surface A,
and the top of the Tub within, must burden A, as much,
as if it were 34 foot high; for being of this hight, it only
stands upon the surface, without pressing up the top of
the Tub.</p>
               <p>I infer from the second assertion, that each Pillar in a
Fluid hath a determinate weight. This is evident from
the determinate weight of A B, that weighs first 168
pound, being 12 foot high, and 467 pound, being 34
foot high, and so of the rest. I infer secondly, that the
thicker, and grosser a Pillar of a Fluid be, it is the heavier,
(even in the <hi>Artificial Ballance</hi>) and contrariwise, the more
slender and thinner it be, it is the lighter. This is evident
from the Water A B, six inches thick, that weighs 476
pound, and from the Water E G, 12 inches thick, that
weighs 1904 pound. So doth the Pillar of Air C D, weigh
less, then the Pillar F H. Here is ground for knowing
the certain and determinate weight of a Pillar, in any sort
of a Fluid whatsoever. As to Air, its clear and evident,
that a four-square Pillar thereof, 12 inches every way,
weighs 1904. That's to say, if it were possible, to take
the Pillar of Air F H, in its whole length, from the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the <hi>earth,</hi> to the top of the <hi>Atmosphere,</hi> and pour
it into the Scale of a Ballance, it would be exactly the
weight of 1904 pound. Here is a secret: though that
same Pillar of Air, were no longer, than 6 or 10 foot, yet
the Pressure of it, upon the body, it rests upon, is equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to 1904 pound. If this be, (you say) what is the
weight of Air, that rests upon this Table, that's 36 inches
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:106992:116"/>
square? I answer, it must be as heavy, as a Pillar of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
34 foot high, and 36 inches thick, which will, by just
reckoning, amount to 17136 pound, or to 1071 stone
weight. It may be inquired next, what's the weight of
the Air, that burdens the pavement of this parlour,
that's 16 foot square? I answer 487424 pound. Because
it is exactly the weight of a bulk of Water 34 foot high,
and 16 foot thick. 'Tis to be remembred, that though
the Pressure of it, be so much, yet being poured into
the scale of a Ballance, it will not weigh so much: for
not only as much as fills the room must be taken, but as
much as passeth from the pavement to the top of the
<hi>Atmosphere.</hi> According to this method 'tis easie to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the weight of any Pillar of Air whatsoever, provided
a man but once know the thickness of it, both the wayes,
<hi>e. g.</hi> there's a <hi>planum</hi> 12 inches long, and six inches broad,
upon which rests a Pillar of Air. The weight of it then
is, just the burden of a magnitude of Water 34 foot in
hight, 12 inches in length, and six inches in breadth.</p>
               <p>Though the weight of any Pillar of Air may be known,
by knowing only the dimensions of it, in breadth and
length; yet the weight of a Pillar of Water cannot be
known, unless all the three common dimensions of it,
be first known. The reason is this, the Pillars of Air,
are all of the same hight, but the Pillars of Water in the
Ocean, are of different hights: therefore, not only must
they be known, <hi>secundum longitudinem, &amp; latitudinem,</hi>
in length and breadth, but <hi>secundum profunditatem,</hi> that
is, according to deepness. 'Tis easie to know then, what
each particular Pillar weighs. First then, try how much
weight is in a cubical foot of Water, and having found
this to be <hi>v. g.</hi> 56 pound, you may determine, that a
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:106992:117"/>
Pillar of Water 34 foot high, and 12 inches thick, weighs
1904 pound. A Pillar 34 foot high, and six inches
thick weighs 476 pound. Note, that in a Cube of
Water six inches thick, there are 216 inches, which
weighs seven pound. In a Pillar 12 inches thick, and 20
fathom, or 100 foot high, you will find 5600 pound
weight. In one, of the same thickness, but 200 fathom
high, there are 56000, fifty six thousand pound weight.
In a Pillar three foot square, and 20 fathom deep, there
are 50400, fifty thousand, and four hundred pound
weight. Make it 800 fathom high with that thickness,
and it will weigh 504000, five hundred and four thousand
pound. But, if according to the Theorem 25, you
consider the weight of the Air above, it will weigh
521136, five hundred, twenty and one thousand, one
hundred thirty and six pound. A Pillar 12 foot square,
and 300 fathom deep, weighs 12096000, twelve million,
ninety and six thousand pound, Lastly suppose there
were a bulk of Water 500 fathom deep, and 500 fathom
thick, such a magnitude would weigh 8750000000,
eight thousand seven hundred, and fifty million of
pounds. But if the Pressure of the Air, that rests upon
a surface of Water 500 fathom in breadth and length,
be taken in, that weighs 119000000, a hundred and
nineteen million of pounds, the total, that the bottom
of the sea sustains, must be 8940000000, eight thousand,
nine hundred and fourty million of pounds, or 558750000
five hundred fifty and eight million, seven hundred, and
fifty thousand stone weight.</p>
               <p>I infer from the fifth assertion, that the lightest of
Fluids may be brought to an <hi>equilibrium</hi> with the heaviest.
For though Mercury be 14000 times heavier than Air,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:106992:117"/>
yet the part of the surface A, is no more prest with
the Mercury A B, then the part C is prest with the Air
C D. Secondly, that 29 inches of Mercury, are of the
same weight with 34 foot of Water. Thirdly, the heavier
a Fluid be naturally, it hath the less altitude in the
<hi>Natural Ballance;</hi> and contrariwise, the lighter it be, it
hath the more altitude. This is clear from the Mercury,
that's 29 inches, the Water that's 34 foot, and the Air,
that's counted 6867 fathom.</p>
               <p>I infer from the sixth assertion, that two Fluids of
different <hi>gravities,</hi> may make an <hi>equilibrium</hi> with a third
of the same kind. Because the 27 foot of Air I G, and
the 17 foot of Water E K, are in <hi>equilibrio</hi> with the Air
F H. I infer secondly, that 17 foot of Air, may be as
heavy as 17 foot of Water, because the Air I G, is exactly
as heavy, as the Water E K. I infer thirdly, that the
<hi>Bensil</hi> of a Fluid, is a thing really distinct, from the
<hi>Natural weight</hi> of it: because the Pressure of the Air I G,
is 952 pound; but the natural weight of it will not exceed,
if it were weighed in a Ballance, two or three ounces.
I infer fourthly, that Air cannot suffer dilatation, but it
must lose of it's Pressure. Because the Air I G, that ought
to weigh 1904 pound, weighs only 952. For under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this, you must know, that when a Pipe is
about half full of Air, and half full of Water, and inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
so much of the Water falls out, and consequently
so many inches doth the Air above it, expand it self. So
to make this Pipe that's 34 foot high, half full of Air
and half full of Water, you must pour in about 19 foot
of Water, and the 15 foot of Air that's in it besides,
will, when the Pipe is inverted, go up and expand it self
to 17 foot, two foot of Water falling out.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:106992:118"/>
I infer from the seventh assertion, that when there are
two Fluids of different gravities, and weights counterpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
a third, by what proportion the one grows lighter,
by that same proportion the other becomes heavier. For,
when the VVater E K, that weighs 952 pound, becomes
E N, that weighs 476, the Air above it, that weighed
952, becomes now 1428 pound.</p>
               <p>I infer from the eighth, that the <hi>pondus</hi> of a Fluid, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be counterpoised, by two distinct <hi>powers.</hi> Because
the 34 foot of Water E G, cannot be both sustained, by
the part of the surface of Air E, and my hand. I infer from
the ninth, that the Pressure and weight of a Fluid, may
be found, even in its own Element, by <hi>sense.</hi> Because
in poising of the Tub, I find the weight of the Air L M.
I infer secondly, that the <hi>weight</hi> of a Fluid is only found in
its own Element, when there is not a <hi>potentia</hi> to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poise
the <hi>pondus</hi> of it, because I find only the weight of
the Air L M, because it wants a <hi>potentia</hi> to counterpoise
it. I infer thirdly, that it is very possible even in the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
Ballance,</hi> to weigh a Fluid in its own Element, and
to know the precise weight of it, to a grain. For this
cause, take a small chord, and fasten therewith the top of
the Pipe G, to the Scale of a Ballance, and the Lead or
Stone that makes the counterpoise in the opposite Scale, is
the just weight of the Air L M.</p>
               <p>I infer from the tenth, that by how much the nearer,
the <hi>potentia</hi> of a Fluid, comes to the <hi>pondus,</hi> by so much
the less, is the <hi>pondus</hi> found, or is sensible. This is clear,
because I find less of the weight of the Air L M, it being
counterpoised with the Air I G, than before. This fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
likewise from the eleventh assertion. I infer from the
twelfth, that when the <hi>pondus</hi> of a Fluid, is counterpoised,
<pb facs="tcp:106992:118"/>
                  <figure/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:106992:119"/>
                  <figure/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:106992:120"/>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:106992:120"/>
by an equal <hi>potentia,</hi> it becomes altogether insensible. I
infer from the last, that two Fluids differing in weight, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Libra</hi> or <hi>Artificial Ballance,</hi> may agree in
weight, according to the <hi>Natural Ballance.</hi> I infer secondly,
that Fluids in the <hi>Ballance</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> do not counterpoise
one another according to their <hi>thickness,</hi> but only accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their <hi>altitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To put a close to this Experiment, let us suppose the
Pipe E G to be 68 foot high, and void of Air. If
then the orifice E be drowned among stagnant Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the Liquor of its own accord (as it were) will rise
from E to K 34 foot, the other half I G remaining
empty. This evidently shews, that the Pressure of the
Air, hath a <hi>Sphere of Activity,</hi> beyond which it is not
able to raise or press up a pillar of VVater. 'Tis folly then
to think that Water may be conveyed over high places by
the help of a <hi>Siphon, v. g.</hi> from the one side of a Hill over
the top, to the other side. For, if that hight exceed
perpendicularly 34 foot, no Art will do it. Yet contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise,
it is possible to transport Water, by <hi>Pipes</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phons,</hi>
not only 34 foot below the <hi>source,</hi> but 3400.
Nay, if there were a <hi>Siphon</hi> passing from the surface of
the Earth to the Center, and thence rising to the surface
again, it would convey Water from the one place to the
other. For 'tis a certain and infallible rule in the <hi>Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staticks,</hi>
that Water will rise as high in this place, as the
hight of the place is, from whence it comes, even though
the windings and turnings of the <hi>Lead-Conduits</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground
were as a <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> and though this place, were
not only 1000, but 5000 pace distant from the other.
'Tis to be observed, that if the mouth of the <hi>Conduit</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:106992:121"/>
here, be exactly as high as the other end at the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
the Water stands still. And the greater the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
be, the Water flows out with the greater force.
By the help of such <hi>Conduits,</hi> 'tis easie to convey Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to a City many miles. Such Pipes are ordinarily
made of Lead. But for saving expence, they may be
made of Timber, or Clay well burnt in an Oven.</p>

OBSERVATIONS,
Lately made, by the Author of the
foregoing EXPERIMENTS.</head>
            <div n="1" type="observation">
               <head>OBSERVATION I.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N <hi>May</hi> 1669, there was need of a new
Sink, on the east side of <hi>Tranent,</hi> for
winning of <hi>Coals.</hi> But while the <hi>Coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hewers</hi>
were in digging down, and had
come the deepness of 13 or 14 fathom,
they were stopped from working by
<hi>Damps,</hi> or ill Air, that flowed out plentifully from the
sides of the sink, wherein there were a great number of
<hi>Cutters,</hi> or rifts, out of which that ill Air came. To try
the nature and power of <hi>Damps,</hi> I took a dog, and fastned
him in a <hi>bucket,</hi> with a small roap, that he might not leap
over, and when he had gone down 7 or 8 fathom, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
begins to howl, and cry pitifully, as if he had been
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:106992:122"/>
beaten sore with a rod, and a little after, he begins to stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and his feet failing him, he falls down, as one overtaken
with the Epilepsy, and in going down to the bottom, his
eyes turning in his head, they appeared very shining and
clear like two large bright Diamonds. Fearing, that the
<hi>Damp</hi> should have killed him out of hand, he was instantly
pulled up from the bottom, where he had not tarried 15 <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds</hi>
of time. And when the bucket had come to the mouth
of the <hi>sink,</hi> he was pulled out, and laid upon the ground, to
get fresh Air. When he had lien a while as dead, he begins
at last to gape, and gasp, and makesome respirations, as if he
had been rather expiring, than recovering. Next, he began to
stir and move his feet, and after, to raise himself upon his
knees, his head staggering and wavering from side to side.
After a <hi>minut</hi> or two, he was able to stand upon his feet,
but so weakly, that he was not in capacity to walk or run.
Yet at last, being much refreshed, he escaped from us, and ran
home, but slowly. In the afternoon, the same Experiment
was repeated, with another dog, whose case was the same
in all things. But after he was perfectly recovered, for a
further trial, we let him down the second time, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him to tarry in the bottom of the <hi>sink,</hi> about the space
of three minuts: but when he was pulled up, and taken
out, we found no symptomes of life in him; and so after
half an hour and more, his body began to swell, which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
befalls such, who are killed after this manner. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, we sent down in the Bucket, a little Chicken,
which, when it came near the <hi>Damp,</hi> presently flapped
with the wings, and falling down, turned over and over
for a pretty while, as if it had been taken with a <hi>vertigo,</hi> or
giddiness. But by drawing up the Bucket in haste, and
bringing the Bird to the fresh Air, it recovered. In the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:106992:122"/>
evening, we let down a <hi>lighted Candle,</hi> but it was soon
extinguished, when it came near mid-sink; for here, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than in the bottom, was the strongest Damp. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we let down by a chord, a <hi>Brand-iron,</hi> with burning
Coals, whose flame was soon put out, and after a little
while, we perceived the red Coals to be extinguished by
degrees; yet not totally, because, as the Coal-hewers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
the power of the <hi>Damp</hi> was not so strong, as before.
These <hi>Damps</hi> then have their ebbings and flowings, which
seem to depend upon the weather, or rather upon the situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the winds, and their force. For 'tis observed, that a
high South-west wind causeth ill Air in this place; and
that, by reason of much wast ground, that lies upon the
South, and South-west hand of this <hi>Sink,</hi> whence are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
under ground by secret passages, which are nothing
else but so many rifts and openings, commonly called by
the <hi>Coal-hewers, Cutters,</hi> corrupted and rotten Air, full
of sulphurious stems. The reason why these passages are
open, and replenished with nothing, but corrupted Air, is
this, the Water, that's ordinarily called the Blood of the
Coal, being withdrawn with subterraneous Gutters (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>Levels</hi>) that are digged, and wrought under
ground, sometimes a very long way, for drying of the <hi>Mines,</hi>
and the veins of the earth being now empty, there suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
Air; which Air, by process of time, and long stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
rots, and contracts a sulphurious quality, which
causeth sudden death. Now, when the wind is high, and
strong from the South or South-west, that sulphurious Air
is driven through the ground, and coming to <hi>Sinks</hi> and
<hi>Mines,</hi> where men are working, presently infects the place,
and hinders the work. 'Tis often observed, that the wind
and Air under ground, keep a correspondence in their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:106992:123"/>
with the wind above ground: and therefore, when the
wind is in such a point above, 'tis found, that the motion
of the Air below runs such a way, and the contrary way,
when the wind above ground, is in the opposite point.
When there is a free passage between the bottom of the
two Sinks, you may observe the wind come down through
the one, and running alongst under the ground, rise up tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the other, even as Water runs thorow a <hi>Siphon.</hi> For
this cause, when the <hi>Coal-hewers</hi> have done with such a
<hi>Sink,</hi> they do not use to stop it, or close it up, but leaves
it standing open, that the Air under ground may be kept
under a perpetual motion and stirring, which to them is a
great advantage. 'Tis very strange to see sometimes, how
much Air, and how fresh it will be, even at a very great
distance, namely four or five hundred pace, from the mouth
of the <hi>Sink.</hi> This could never be, unless there were a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Pressure and weight in it, whereby it is driven for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
thorow so many <hi>Labyrinths.</hi> And even in the utmost
room, where the <hi>Coal-hewers</hi> are working, the Pressure is as
great, as it is above ground, which is found by the <hi>Torricel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
Experiment.</hi> In such a case, the Air cannot press down
thorow the Earth and Metalls, therefore the Mercury must
be suspended, not by a Pillar from the <hi>Atmosphere,</hi> but by
the <hi>Bensil</hi> of it. Nay, put the case, that the whole Element
of Air were destroyed, and this remaining, yet would it be
able to support 29 inches. To shut up this discourse, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by the <hi>Coal-hewers,</hi> that when there is ill Air in a
<hi>Sink,</hi> a man may perceive distinctly, what is lying in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
so clear and transparent is the Air of it: but when the
<hi>Damp</hi> is gone, the <hi>Medium</hi> is not so clear. In temperat and
cold weather, the <hi>Damps</hi> are not so frequent. From this <hi>Sink,</hi>
in soft winds, or in Northerly winds, or when it blows from
East or North-east, the <hi>Damps</hi> are driven away.</p>

                  <hi>JUpiter</hi> upon Wednesday night, at eleven a clock,
being 24 of <hi>November,</hi> 1669, had the following
position with the stars of <hi>Gemini.</hi> He was so near to the
Star C, that to appearance, the points of his rayes did
touch it. This Star by looking upon the material Glob,
is fixed in the very <hi>Zodiack,</hi> and in the 13 degree of
<hi>Cancer,</hi> and is the very navel of the following <hi>Twine.</hi> The
Star A is <hi>Castor.</hi> The Star B is <hi>Pollux.</hi> The star D, is
fixed in the forefoot of the following <hi>Twine.</hi> From this
place he moved, with a retrograde motion, till he came
to the 5 of <hi>Cancer,</hi> about the 20 of <hi>February,</hi> 1670,
and from that time became <hi>Direct</hi> in his motion, and so
upon the 27 of <hi>March,</hi> 1670 at 9 a clock, he was in a
right line with <hi>Canis minor,</hi> and the brightest Star in
<hi>Auriga,</hi> and was in a right line with the eastmost shoulder
of <hi>Orion,</hi> and <hi>Castor</hi> in <hi>Gemini,</hi> or with that Star, when

            </div>
            <div n="3" type="observation">
               <head>OBSERVATION III.</head>
               <p>IT is written in the History of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> that
such a member of it, whose name I have forgotten,
hath found out, among many other curious inventions,
this, namely a way for knowing the motion of the Sun
in <hi>seconds</hi> of time: but is not pleased to reveal the manner
how. Because such a <hi>device</hi> may be usefull in Astronomy,
and likewise for adjusting the <hi>Pendulum Clock,</hi> I shall
therefore briefly shew, the manner and way how such a
thing may be done, as I have tried it my self. I took an
<hi>Optick Tub,</hi> about 12 foot long, only with two <hi>Convex-glasses</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:106992:124"/>
in it, and did so place it in a dark room, by putting
the one end, in which was the <hi>Object-glass,</hi> without the
window, and keeping the other within, that I caused the
beams of the Sun shine thorow it, which were received upon
a white wall four or five foot from the Tub. This image,
which was perfectly round, and splendid, did move
alongst the wall very quickly, so that in a minut of time,
it did advance seven inches and a half, which will be the
eight part of an inch in a <hi>second,</hi> a motion very sensible.
Now, this beam that came thorow the Tub, and lighted
upon the wall, would not have moved one inch in a minut,
if it had wanted the two Glasses; for as they magnify,
and seem to bring nearer the <hi>Object,</hi> so they quicken the
motion of it. In a word, by what proportion the <hi>Object</hi>
is made more, by that same proportion is the motion
quickned. 'Tis to be observed, that the longer the Tub
be, the motion is the swifter: for as the longest Tub
doth ordinarily most magnify the object; so doth it most
quicken the motion. Next, the farther distant the
white wall is from the end of the Tub, the larger is the
image; and contrariwise, the nearer it be, it is the less.
Thirdly, the farther the wall be from the end of the
Tub, the circumference of the image is the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
and the nearer it be, it is the more distinct.
Fourthly, the darker the room be, it is so much the
better. Lastly, this trial may be made with ordinary
<hi>Prospects,</hi> of a foot, two foot, or three foot long, which
will really do the thing, but not so sensibly, unless the
glasses be very good.</p>
               <p>As to the use of this device in Astronomy, I shall not
say much. But shall only mention what it may serve for
in order to the Pendulum Clock. For this cause, let a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:106992:124"/>
man choise a convenient room, with a window to the South,
wherein this Tub may be so fixed, that it may<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly just,
or very near to the true <hi>meridian,</hi> and may move <hi>vertically</hi>
upon an axil-tree, because of the Suns declination every
day. Then at a certain distance from the end of it,
fix and settle a large board of timber, smooth, and well
plained, and well whited, for receiving the image. In
the middle of this board, draw a circle with Charcoal,
equal in diameter to the circle of the image. Now, this
being done, you will find that assoon as the west side of
the Sun, begins to come near to the <hi>Meridian,</hi> the image
begins to appear upon the board, like the segment of a
circle, and grows larger, and larger, till it become per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
round. Now in the very instant of time, wherein
the image, and the circle are united, set the wheels of
your Clock a going, from the <hi>hour, minut,</hi> and <hi>second</hi> of
XII. To morrow, or 3 or 4 dayes after, when you
desire to make an examination, wait on about 12 a clock,
when the Sun is coming to the <hi>Meridian,</hi> and you will
find what the difference is. If the <hi>Clock</hi> go slow, observe,
assoon as the image is united with the circle (which you
will perceive in a <hi>second</hi> of time) the variation, that's
to say, how many <hi>seconds</hi> interveens between that <hi>second,</hi>
wherein the union fell, and that <hi>second,</hi> that closes XII
hours in the <hi>Clock.</hi> If it go fast, observe how many
<hi>seconds</hi> passes from that <hi>second,</hi> that ends XII hours, and
that wherein the image of the Sun is united with the circle,
which if you do, you will know exactly, what the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is, even to a <hi>second.</hi> But without this, you will
find great difficulty to know the variation in 15 or 20
<hi>seconds,</hi> especially in a common <hi>Dial.</hi> But here, you
will see distinctly the image of the Sun move every <hi>second</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:106992:125"/>
of time, the eighth part, or the sixth part, or the fourth
part of an inch, according to the length of your Tub, and
goodness of your glasses. 'Tis to be observed, that in
adjusting the <hi>Pendulum Clock,</hi> respect must be had to
the table of <hi>Equation</hi> of <hi>dayes,</hi> commonly known in
Astronomy. For if this be not, it is impossible to make
it go right, and that because all the natural dayes of the
year, are not equal among themselves: that's to say, the
time that's spent by the Suns motion from the <hi>Meridian</hi>
this day, to the same <hi>Meridian,</hi> the next day, is not
equal, but is more or less, than the time spent betwixt
<hi>Meridian</hi> and <hi>Meridian,</hi> a third or fourth day after. For
instance, the Sun this day being 11 of <hi>Iuly,</hi> comes sooner
to the Meridian by three <hi>seconds</hi> of time, than he came
yesterday. Within 9 or 10 dayes, (suppose the 22 of <hi>Iuly</hi>)
he will be longer in coming to the Meridian by 4 <hi>seconds,</hi>
than upon the 21. This difference I grant, in short time
is not sensible, yet once in the year, it will amount to
more than half an hour. This inequality of dayes arises
from two causes. First, from the Suns <hi>eccentricity,</hi> whereby
he moves slowlier in one part of the Zodiack, than in
another: for in Summer when he is furthest from the
Earth, he goes slowlier back in the Ecliptick, than in
Winter, when he is nearer to it. The second cause,
which is truly the far greater, is this, because in the
diurnal motion of the Sun, equal parts of the <hi>Aequator,</hi>
does not answer to equal parts of the <hi>Zodiack.</hi> Hence
it followes, that if the natural dayes be not equal among
themselves, the hours must be unequal also: but this is
not considerable.</p>
               <p>By help of such a Tub placed in a dark room, it is
easie, when the Sun is under Eclipse, to enumerat distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:106992:125"/>
the digits eclipsed. Likewise, if you take out the
object Glass, and cover a hole in the window board with
it, you shall see distinctly upon a white wall, the <hi>species</hi>
and true representations of all objects without. And by
comparing the quantity of the object without, with the
quantity of it within, you may know the distance of it
from the window, though it were many miles. For as the
one quantity, is to the other, so is the distance between
the Glass and the object on the wall, to the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Glass and the object without.</p>
               <p>It may be inquired whether or not, the <hi>retrograde,</hi> as
well as the <hi>diurnal motion</hi> of any of the Planets, may
be discerned, in <hi>minuts</hi> or <hi>seconds,</hi> by the help of a long
<hi>Telescope?</hi> In answer to this, we must suppose the
Planets only to have a <hi>retrograde</hi> motion, and consequently
to move slowly from West to East, <hi>Saturn</hi> once in 29
years, or 30, to run about the <hi>Zodiack; Iupiter</hi> in 12,
<hi>Mars</hi> in 2 years, the Sun in one year, <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi>
in less time, and lastly the <hi>Moon</hi> in a moneth. Now I
say, it is impossible by the longest Tub, that the greatest
<hi>Artist</hi> can make, to discern the motion of the inferior

<hi>Minuts</hi> or in <hi>Seconds,</hi> and that by reason of the great

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dity, and slowness of the motion. Notwithstanding
of this, I am induced to think, that the retrograde motion
of the <hi>Moon</hi> might be discerned, at least in <hi>Minuts.</hi> For
evincing of this, let us suppose which is true, that the
<hi>Sun</hi> runs from East to West half a degree in two Minuts
of time, seing in an hour he runs 15 degrees. Next, that
the <hi>Moon</hi> goes about the <hi>Zodiack</hi> in 27 dayes and 7 hours,
namely from that same point, to that point again, and
consequently runs back every day 13 degrees and about
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:106992:126"/>
10 Minuts. By this account, she must <hi>retrograde</hi> half a
degree, and about 2 minuts of a degree every hour. The
<hi>Sun</hi> then runs half a degree in two <hi>Minuts,</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi>
half a degree in 60 <hi>Minuts;</hi> therefore the <hi>Moon</hi> must be
30 times slower in her <hi>retrograde</hi> motion, than the <hi>Sun</hi> is
in his diurnal motion. Let us suppose next, as I observed
with a Tub 12 foot long, that the image of the <hi>Sun</hi>
runs the eighth part of an inch every <hi>second,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
seven inches and an half, in a <hi>Minut:</hi> then
must the image of the Moon with that same <hi>Telescope,</hi>
run the thirtieth part of seven inches and a half in a
Minut, seing she runs 30 times slowlier; therefore in
every <hi>Minut</hi> of time she must advance the fourth part
of an inch, which will be very sensible. Though we
grant, that the <hi>Moon</hi> hath no <hi>retrograde</hi> motion properly,
yet by comparing the diurnal Motion of the <hi>Moon,</hi> that's
slower, to the diurnal motion of the <hi>Sun,</hi> that's swifter,
we shall really find the thing it self. Therefore in the
time of a <hi>Solar Eclipse,</hi> this <hi>retrograde</hi> motion is conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous,
which by an ordinary <hi>Telescope</hi> may be discerned
in <hi>Minuts.</hi> Assoon then as the East side of the <hi>Moon,</hi>
begins to enter upon the West side of the <hi>Sun</hi> (the
greater the <hi>Eclipse</hi> be, it is the better) observe, and
you will find the one image, which will be black, cover
the other by degrees, that's splendid, and run in every
minut of time, the fourth part of an inch of the <hi>Suns</hi>
diameter, provided alwayes, that the <hi>Sun</hi> run the eighth
part of an inch in a <hi>second.</hi>

               <p>UPon <hi>Tuesday</hi> the 19. of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1670, the following
Experiment was made. In the middle Marches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> there is a long tract of Hills,
that run from <hi>Flowdon,</hi> many miles South and South-west,
amongst the which, the Mountain <hi>Cheviot</hi> is famous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond,
and conspicuous above all the rest for altitude, from
whose top a man may discern with one turning of his eye,
the whole Sea-coast from <hi>New-castle</hi> to <hi>Berwick,</hi> much of
<hi>Northumberland,</hi> and very many Leagues into the great
<hi>German Ocean:</hi> the whole <hi>Mers</hi> and <hi>Teviotdale,</hi> from
the foot of <hi>Tweed,</hi> to very near the head of it: <hi>Lauderdale,</hi>
and <hi>Lammer-moor,</hi> and <hi>Pentland-hills</hi> above <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
The North side of this Mountain is pretty steep, yet easie
to climb, either with men or horse. The top is spacious,
large and broad, and all covered with a <hi>Flow-moss,</hi> which
runs very many miles South. When a man rides over it,
it rises and falls. 'Tis easie to thrust a Lance over the head
in it. The sides of this Hill abounds with excellent Well-springs,
which are the original of several Torrents, amongst
the which <hi>Colledge-Water</hi> is famous, upon which, not a
mile from the foot of this Mountain is <hi>White-hall.</hi> The
adjacent Hills are for the most part green, and excellent
for the pasturage of Cattel. Not many years ago, the
whole Valleys near the foot of <hi>Cheviot,</hi> were Forrests a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
with <hi>Wild-Deer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the highest part of this Mountain was erected the
<hi>Torricellian Experiment</hi> for weighing of the Air, where
we found the altitude of the <hi>Mercurial Cylinder</hi> 27 inches
and an half. The Air was dry and clear, and no wind. In
our Valley-Countreys, near to the Sea-Coast, in such
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:106992:127"/>
Weather, we find the altitude 29 inches and an half.
When this difference was found, care was taken to seal up
closly with <hi>Bee-wax,</hi> mixed with <hi>Turpentine,</hi> the orifice
of the Vessel, that contained the stagnant Mercury, and
thorow which the end of the Pipe went down. This being
done with as great exactness as could be, it was carried to
the foot of the Mountain in a Frame of Wood, made on
purpose, and there opening the mouth of the Vessel, we
found the Mercury to rise an inch and a quarter higher than
it was. The reason of this strange <hi>Phenomenon</hi> must be this,
namely a greater Pressure of the Air at the foot of the Hill,
than upon the top: even as there is a greater Pressure of
Water in a surface 40 fathom deep, than in a surface 20
fathom deep. 'Tis not to be doubted. but if the root of
the Mountain had been as low as the Sea Coast, or as the
surface of <hi>Tweed</hi> at <hi>Kelso,</hi> the <hi>Mercurial Cylinder</hi> would
have been higher. This way of observing, seems to be
better than the common: for while the <hi>Baroscope</hi> is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up and down the Hill, without stopping the orifice of
the Vessel, that contains the stagnant Mercury, the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder</hi>
makes such reciprocations, by the agitation of a mans
body, that sometimes abundance of Air is seen to ascend
up thorow the Pipe, which in effect makes the <hi>Cylinder</hi>
shorter than it ought to be. But if so be, the end of the
Pipe be immerged among <hi>Quick-silver,</hi> contained in a
Glass with a narrow orifice, so that it may be stopped com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly,
you will find no reciprocations at all. And to
make all things the more sure, the Glass may be filled up
either with <hi>Mercury,</hi> or with Water above the <hi>Mercury;</hi>
by which means the <hi>Cylinder</hi> in the down-coming, or in the
up-going shall remain immoveable. Besides the stopping
of the orifice of the said Glass, you may have a wider Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:106992:127"/>
that may receive the same Glass into it, and it being
full of Water, may so cover the sealed orifice, that there
shall be no hazard of any Air coming in. Or this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be first tried at the root of the Hill, and having
stopped compleatly the mouth of the Vessel, the whole
Engine may be carried up to the top, where you will find
the <hi>Mercury</hi> subside and fall down so much; namely after
the said orifice is opened: for as the stopping of the orifice
at the root of the Hill, is the cause, why that same degree
of Pressure remains in the stagnant Liquor; so the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it upon the top of the Hill, is the cause why it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
less.</p>
               <p>This Experiment lets us see, that the Pressure of the
Air seems to be as the Pressure of the Water, namely the
further down the greater; and the further up the less: and
therefore, as by coming up to the top of the Water, there
is no more Pressure, so by coming up to the top of the Air,
there is no more weight in it; which in effect sayes, that
the Air hath a determinat hight, as the Water hath. From
this Experiment we cannot learn the determinat hight of
the Air, because the definit hight of the Mountain is not
known. I know there are some, who think that the Air
is indefinitly extended, as if forsooth, the Firmament of
fixed Stars were the limits of it, but I suppose it is hard to
make it out.</p>

                  <hi>JUne</hi> 5. 1670. I observed the <hi>Sun</hi> within 3 <hi>minuts</hi> of
setting, to have a perfect <hi>oval figure,</hi> the two ends ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
level with the Horizon. His colour was not red as

the help of the <hi>Pendulum Clock,</hi> I have observed his body

               <p>UPon <hi>Saturday</hi> evening the 30 of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1670, and the
night following, till about two a Clock in the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
morning, there fell out a considerable rain, with great
thunder, and many lightnings. About <hi>Sun-set,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of black clouds appeared first towards the <hi>Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon</hi>
in the South-west, with several lightnings; and the
wind blowing from that point, carried the clouds and rain
over <hi>Mid</hi> and <hi>East-Lothian,</hi> towards the <hi>Firth</hi> and <hi>Sea-coast.</hi>
About 9 a clock, the whole Heavens almost were
covered with dark clouds, yet the rain was not very great,
neither were the <hi>thunder claps</hi> frequent, but every <hi>fifth</hi> or
<hi>sixth second</hi> of time, a large and great lightning brake out.
But before the <hi>thunder crack</hi> was heard, which happened
every fourth or fifth <hi>minut,</hi> the lightning was so terrible
for greatness, and brightness, that it might have bred asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
And because the night was very dark, and the
lightning very splendid, a man might have perceived
houses and co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n-fields at a great distance. And if any had
resolved to catch it, in the breaking out, it did so dazle
the eyes, that for half a <hi>minut,</hi> he was not able to see any
thing about him.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the lightning that went before the thunder,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:106992:128"/>
brake forth from the clouds, like a long spout of fire, or
rather like a long flame raised high, with a Smiths Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
but did not continue long in sight. Such an one
above the Firth was seen to spout downward upon the Sea.
Sometimes there appeared from the one end of the cloud
to the other, an <hi>hiatus,</hi> or wide opening, all full of fire,
in form of a long furrow, or branch of a River, not straight,
but crooked. I suppose the breadth of it, in it self, would
have been twenty pace and more, and the length of it five
or six hundred pace: the duration of it, would have been
about a second of time. Sometimes a man might have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the nether side of the cloud, before the crack came,
all speckled with streams of fire, here and there, like the
side of an Hill, where Moor-burn is, which brake forth
into a lightning. But there was one, after which followed
a terrible thunder crack, which far exceeded all the rest,
for quantity and splendor. It brake out from the cloud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shot from North to South, in form of fire from a great
<hi>Cannon,</hi> but in so great quantity, as if a Gun ten foot wide,
with 500 pound weight of Powder in it, had been fired. And
surely the lightning behoved to be far greater in it self, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it appeared so great, at so great a distance. It did not
evanish in an instant, like the fire of a Gun, but continued
about a second and an half; by reason (it seems) that it
could not break out all at once. This did so dazle the sight,
that for half a minut almost, nothing was seen, but like a
white mist flying before the eyes. The whole Countrey
about was seen distinctly.</p>
               <p>All these great lightnings were seen a considerable time,
before the crack was heard. Sometimes 30 <hi>seconds</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
by the <hi>Pendulum Clock</hi> interveened, namely when
the thunder was at a distance, about 7 or 8 miles. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:106992:129"/>
15 or 16 only interveened. But when the thunder
was just above our head, no moe passed, than 7 or 8,
which seems to demonstrat, that these thick black clouds,
out of which the thunder breaks, are not a <hi>Scottish</hi> mile
from the earth, when they are directly above us.</p>
               <p>'Tis observable, that in all lightnings, and thunderings,
there is no smoke to be seen, which seems to evince, that
the matter whereof they are generated, must be most pure,
and subtil. Who knows, but this Countrey, that abounds
with <hi>Coal,</hi> may occasion more thunder and lightnings, than
other places, namely by sending up sulphurious exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the middle region of the Air, wherewith the <hi>Coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>
abound.</p>

               <p>THis is a method for finding out the true South and
North Points, which are in effect very difficult to
know. Take therefore four pieces of Timber, each one
of them five foot long, and about six inches thick, square<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
Sharpen their ends, and fix them so in the ground,
that they may stand Perpendicular, and as near to South and
North, by a <hi>Magnetick Needle,</hi> as may be. The place
would be free of Trees, or of any such impediment, that it
may have a free prospect of the Heavens. As for their
distance one from another, let the two North-most, and
the South-most be two foot asunder: let the two East-most,
and two West-most, be but one foot, making as
they stand, an <hi>oblong quadrangle.</hi> For keeping them equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distant
above, as well as below, take four bars of Wood,
about three inches broad, and one inch thick, and nail them
round about upon the four sides, on each side one, so that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:106992:129"/>
being nailed on <hi>Horizontally,</hi> they may make <hi>right angles,</hi>
with the tops of the standards above. There are then for
distinctions cause, the North-bar, and the South-bar,
that runs East and West, and the East-bar, and the West-bar,
that runs South and North, There is here no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in the thing it self, but only in the fancy to conceive
it. Besides these four, there must be other four of the
same form and fashion, nailed on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arder down about the
middle of the four standards. Take next some small Brass
Wyre strings, such as are used in <hi>Virginals,</hi> and fix one from
the middle of the South-bar, that's upmost, to the middle
of the South-bar just under it. Fix it so, that it may be
exactly Perpendicular, which may be done, with a great
weight of Lead. Take a second Wyrestring, and hang it
plumb from the West end of the North-bar, and another
from the East end of the same Bar, I mean the Bar that's
nearest to the top. These three strings so fixed, will go
near to make an <hi>equilateral triangle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now because the device is for finding out the <hi>Meridian</hi>
by the Stars in the night time, not by any indifferently,
but by these that are nearest to the <hi>Pole,</hi> therefore observe
in <hi>Iuly</hi> and <hi>August,</hi> when the <hi>Guard-stars</hi> in the evening
begin to come down towards the West, and keeping closs
one eye, bring the other somewhat near to the South-most
string, and order your sight so, that this string, and
the West-most string upon the North side, may catch the
foremost <hi>Guard-star</hi> in the down-coming, when it is furthest
West, and there fix it. When the same Star is turning
up towards the East, catch it by the South-most string,
and the East-most string on the North side, and your work
is done, if so be, you divide exactly, between the East-most
and West-most, and there hang a fourth string, which
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:106992:130"/>
with the string upon the South-side, gives you the true
South and North. For better understanding, note first,
that, when the <hi>Guard-stars</hi> are coming down, or going up,
the <hi>Altitude</hi> varies quickly, but the <hi>Azimuth,</hi> or motion
from East to West, will not vary sometimes sensibly in two
hours almost, which is a great advantage in this case. But
when you find out the <hi>Meridian</hi> with a <hi>Plain,</hi> and a Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular
<hi>Stilus,</hi> by the shadow of the Sun, if it be not when
he is about East and West, the <hi>Azimuth</hi> alters mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e than
the <hi>Altitude,</hi> wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch is a great disadvantage. Now its
certain, the slower the motion be from East to West of any
Star, it is the easier to observe, and it is the more sure
way. Note secondly, that special care must be had, to
cause the strings hang Perpendicular. Note thirdly, that
before you begin your Observations, the South-most string
must be made immoveable, but the East-most, and West-most,
on the other side, must not be so, because as the
Stars in going about move from East to West, so must the
said two strings be left at liberty, to move a little hither
and thither, till the Observations be ended. Note fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that assoon as you perceive sensibly, the foremost <hi>Guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>star</hi>
to decline towards the West, then you must begin to
observe, which is nothing else, but to fix your eye so,
that the South-most and West-most string, may cover the
said Star. And because in coming down, it goes West,
therefore, let the West-most string move towards the left
hand by degrees, following the Star to its utmost, till it
be covered by them both. Follow the same method, in
observing the same Star in going up towards the East. Note
fifthly, that when you make the two strings cover the Star,
that which is nearest to the eye, will appear transparent,
and of a larger size, so that you may perceive distinctly
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:106992:130"/>
thorow it, not only the Star it self, but the other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>string al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
which is a great advantage. This is evident to any,
who holds a bended silk threed between their eye and a
Star in the night time; for when you direct your sight to
the Star, the string appears like the small string of a <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi>
when it trembles. Note sixthly, that in observing
in a dark night, you must have a <hi>Cut-throat,</hi> that by the
light of the candle you may perceive the strings. Some
other things might be noted, but you will find them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by experience, than they can be exprest here.</p>
               <p>I named <hi>Iuly</hi> and <hi>August</hi> in the evening for observing
the <hi>Guard-stars,</hi> when they are West-most, but there are
several other seasons, when this may be done as conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently.
They are East-most in the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> and
beginning of <hi>November</hi> about 5 or 6 a clock in the morning.
If a man were desirous to make this observation quickly, I
suppose he might in the end of <hi>October,</hi> find the said stars
West-most in the evening, and East-most the next morning.
Besides the <hi>Guard-stars,</hi> a man may make use of the <hi>Polar-star;</hi>
for as it goes higher, and lower than the true <hi>Pole,</hi> by
2 degrees and 26 minuts, so it goes as much to the East,
and as much to the West, once in 24 hours. In the end
of <hi>Iuly,</hi> you will find the <hi>Polar-star</hi> East-most, about 9
a clock at night, and in the end of <hi>Ianuary</hi> West-most at 9
a clock. Note, that every month, the fixed stars come
sooner to the same place by two hours: therefore in the
end of <hi>August</hi> the <hi>Polar-star</hi> must be West, at 7 a clock at
night, and East at 7 a clock in the morning. When the
<hi>Meridian</hi> is found out after this manner, there is no <hi>Star</hi> or
<hi>Planet</hi> can pass it, but you may know exactly when, be it
never so high, or never so low. For there is nothing to
be done, but to wait, till the South-most and North-most

most string cover the body of the <hi>Star.</hi> If it be the Sun,

when he is under mist, or a thin cloud, you may exactly
take him up in the <hi>Meridian,</hi> with the two strings. This
Frame will serve as well, to know when any of the North
Stars comes South, or North, and consequently when they
are highest, and when they are lowest: for being fixed in

               <p>THere hath been much inquiry made by some anent
the reason, why the dead body of a man or beast,
riseth from the ground of a Water, after it hath been there
three or four days. But though many have endeavoured to
solve the question, yet the difficulty remains; and in effect
it cannot be answered, without the knowledge of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Doctrine, anent the nature of fluid Bodies. To
find out the reason then of this <hi>Phenomenon,</hi> consider, that
all Bodies, are either naturally heavier then Water, as
Stone and Lead, or naturally lighter, as Wood and Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
If they be heavier, they sink: if they be lighter,
they swim. Now I say, a mans body immediatly after
he is drowned, his belly being full of Water, must go to
the ground, because in this case, it will be found <hi>specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi>
or <hi>naturally</hi> heavier then Water. That's to say, a
mans body, will be heavier, than as much Water, as is
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:106992:131"/>
the bulk of a mans body. For pleasing the fancy, imagine
a Statue to be composed of Water, with all the true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions
of the person that's dead, so that the one shall
answer most exactly to all the dimensions of the other. In
this case, if you counterpoise them in a Ballance, the real
body, that's made up of flesh, blood, and bones, shall
weigh down the other. But after this dead body hath lien
a short time among the Water, it presently begins to swell,
which is caused by the fermentation of the humors of the
blood, which goeth before putrefaction, and after three or
four dayes swells so great, that in effect, it becomes natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
lighter than Water, and therefore riseth. That is
to say, take that body, that is now swelled, and as much
bulk of Water, as will be the precise quantity of it, and
having counterpoised them in a Ballance, you will find the

               <head>OBSERVATION IX.</head>
               <p>UPon <hi>Thursday</hi> the 25 of <hi>August</hi> 1670, the following
Experiment was made in a new <hi>Coal-sink,</hi> on the
West side of <hi>Tranent.</hi> When the <hi>Coal-hewers</hi> had digged
down about 6 or 7 fathom, they were interrupted some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with <hi>ill Air:</hi> therefore to know the power and force
of the <hi>Damp,</hi> we let down within the Bucket a <hi>Dog.</hi> When
he had gone down about 4 fathom, or middle Sink, we
found little or no alteration in him, save only that he
opened his mouth, and had some difficulty in breathing,
which we perceived evidently: for no sooner he was pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
up to the top, where the <hi>good Air</hi> was, but he left off
his gaping. We let him down next to the bottom, where
he tarried a pretty while, but no more change we found in
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:106992:132"/>
him than before. After this we let down a great quantity
of <hi>Whins,</hi> well kindled with a bold flame, but they no
sooner came to the middle of the <hi>sink,</hi> but the flame was in
an instant extinguished: and no sooner was the Bucket pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
up, but they took fire again. This was 5 or 6 times
tried, with the same success. If we compare this Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
with the first, we will find, that all <hi>Damps</hi> are not
of the same power and force; but that some are stronger,
and kills men and beasts in an instant: and that others are
less efficacious, and more feeble, and doth not so much
hurt, and that men may hazard to go down into a <hi>Sink,</hi>
where <hi>ill Air</hi> is, even though fire be sometimes extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
We see next, that these <hi>Damps</hi> doth not alwayes
infect the whole Air of a <hi>Coal-pit,</hi> but only a certain quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity:
for sometimes it is found in the bottom, sometimes
in the middle. And we see lastly, that they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
of long continuance: for it is found, that though
the Air be ill in the morning, yet it may be good ere night;
and totally evanished ere the next day. We may add, as
was noted in the first Observation, that these <hi>Damps</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
much upon the scituation of the winds, seing in strong
Southerly winds, they are frequently in these places.</p>

            <div n="10" type="observation">
               <head>OBSERVATION X.</head>
               <p>OF these many excellent devices, that have been found
out of late, the <hi>Air-pump</hi> is one, first invented in
<hi>Germany,</hi> and afterwards much perfected in <hi>England</hi> by
that Honourable Person Mr <hi>Boyl,</hi> who for his pains, and
industry in making Experiments therewith, deserves the
thanks of all learned persons. Several trials hath been made
of late by it, some whereof, are as follows. I took a slender
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:106992:132"/>
Glass-tub about 40 inches long, closs above, and open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and filled it with VVater. I next inverted it, and
set the orifice of it, just upon the mouth of the Brass-pipe,
that bends upward thorow the board, whereon the <hi>Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
useth to stand, and cemented them together. At the
first exsuction, the whole VVater in the Pipe fell down,
and ran thorow the <hi>Brass-conduit</hi> to the Pump. Having
for a short while stopped the passage, and thrust down the
<hi>Sucker,</hi> I next opened it again, and the <hi>Pump</hi> being full of
VVater, it was driven with a considerable force up thorow
the Pipe; yet was it not compleatly fill'd as before, by
reason of some Air, that I saw in the top. After this was
done, with pleasure five or six times, I opened the <hi>Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock</hi>
more quickly, than I had used, but the VVater, by
this means, was so furiously driven up thorow the Tub,
that in effect, it broke the end of it, that was <hi>Hermetically
sealed;</hi> and the piece that flew off, did hit the seiling so
smartly, that it rebounded a very far way. From this we see
the reason, why VVater falls not down from Vessels that
have narrow necks, though they be inverted, because it's
kept in by the force and power of the environing Air. 'Tis
observable, that though this Pipe had been 30 foot high,
yet the whole VVater in it would have subsided, and fallen
down, with one exsuction.</p>
               <p>The next trial was with the help of a small <hi>Receiver,</hi>
which in effect was a real <hi>Cupping-glass.</hi> This had a hole
made in the bottom of it, and was cemented to the <hi>Brass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate,</hi>
and the mouth of it looking upward, had a lid for
covering of it. I took next the lately mentioned Glass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe,
and filled it with good <hi>Brandy,</hi> and having drowned
the end of it among stagnant <hi>Brandy,</hi> I set the Vessel where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it was within the <hi>Receiver,</hi> the Pipe coming up thorow
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:106992:133"/>
the lid, and having cemented it closly, I made the first
exsuction, and found no descent of the Liquor from the
top of the Tub. At the second, it fell down about an
inch. At the third, it fell down four or five. But here
appeared a great multitude of small Bubbles of Air, like
broken VVater, near the top of the Pipe within. And
besides this <hi>Phenomenon,</hi> there ascended from the stagnant
Liquor up thorow the Pipe, an infinit number of small
Bubbles, no bigger than Pin-heads, for a very large time.
VVith a fourth exsuction, it fell down within two or three
inches of the <hi>stagnant Brandy.</hi> And thinking to make the
one level with the other, I made a fifth; but here appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a strang effect, namely, not only the whole <hi>Brandy</hi> in
the Pipe subsided, and was mingled with the <hi>stagnant Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
but at this exsuction, there came a great quantity of
Air from the mouth of the Pipe, and rose up thorow the
<hi>stagnant Liquor</hi> in Bubbles. Having made another exsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there came yet more Air out, and so copiously, that
I thought there had been some leak in the Tub, through
which the outward Air had entered; but knowing the
contrary, I continued Pumping a very long time, till I
found less and less come out, and at length, after near 30
exsuctions it ceased. This Air to appearance, was so much
as might have filled twenty Tubs, every one of them as
large, as the Tub it came out of. And surely all of it came
out from among the small quantity of <hi>Brandy</hi> that filled the
Pipe, and that environed the mouth of it, I mean the <hi>stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Brandy,</hi> both which would not have been eight spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
After this I opened the <hi>Stop-cock</hi> leasurely to let in
the Air to the <hi>Receiver;</hi> then did the <hi>Brandy</hi> climb up the
Pipe slowly, till it came near to the top, and there made
some little halt, by reason of half an inch of Air that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:106992:133"/>
there. But more and more Air coming into the
<hi>Receiver,</hi> that half inch in the top of the Pipe, did so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish,
that it appeared no bigger than the point of a Pin,
and was scarcely discernable to the eyes. What a strange
and wonderful faculty of dilatation and contraction must be
in the Air, seing that which presently had filled the whole
Tub, that was 40 inches long, and the sixth p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rt of an inch
wide, was contracted to as little room, as the point of a
Needle. And by making some new exsuctions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that small
<hi>Atome</hi> of Air did so dilate it self again, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t filled the
same Tub, and not only that, but, as formerly, it bubbled
out from the mouth of the Pipe several times.</p>
               <p>'Tis to be observed, that though at the first falling
down of the <hi>Brandy,</hi> it appeared like broken Water, near
the top of the Pipe within, yet no such thing was seen the
second time it fell down; the reason is, because by the first
exsuctions, it was well exhausted of its <hi>aërial particles.</hi>
Once or twice I found, after the <hi>Brandy</hi> within the Pipe
was well freed of Air, that no exsuctions could make it
move from the top of the Tub; and observed a round
Bubble of Air to march up, which when once it came to
the top, did separate the one from the other. If this hold
good, it seems to prove, that neither Mercury, nor any
other Liquor would fall down in Pipes, unless there
were Air lurking amongst the parts to fill up the desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
space.</p>
               <p>From this Experiment we learn, that no person can well
apprehend or conceive, how far, and to what bounds the
smallest part of Air is able to expand it self. And it proves
evidently, that when the <hi>Receiver</hi> is as much emptied
as it can be, by the Art of man, yet it is full of Air
compleatly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:106992:134"/>
The third trial was after this manner: I set within the
<hi>Receiver</hi> a little Glass half full of <hi>Brandy,</hi> and the lid being
cemented on, I began to pump, but there appeared no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
at the first exsuction. At the second, I perceived a
great company of very small Bubbles, that for a long time
ascended from the body of it, and came to the surface. At
the third, they were so frequent, and great, that the <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
appeared to seeth and boil, and by reason of the great
ebullitions, much of it ran over the lips of the Glass, and
fell into the bottom of the <hi>Receiver.</hi> This boiling conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
for the space of 7 or 8 exsuctions, and by process of
time, the Bubbles grew fewer and fewer, and when about 30
or 40 exsuctions were made, no more appeared. With this
same sort of <hi>Brandy,</hi> I filled the fore-named Pipe, and set it
within the <hi>Receiver,</hi> the mouth of the Tub being guarded
with the same sort of Liquor. When it began to subside,
there appeared no Bubbles near the top as before: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
seems to be, because the <hi>Brandy</hi> was well exhausted
from its <hi>aërial particles.</hi> For a fourth trial, I filled the
same Tub with Ale, that was only 5 or 6 dayes old, and
drowning the end of it among stagnant Ale of the same
kind, I began to Pump, and found, that assoon as the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
began to subside, from the top of the Pipe, the whole
Ale within the Pipe, almost turned into Air, and Froth,
and so many large Bubbles came up from the stagnant Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
that I thought the whole was converted into Air. It
was most pleasant to behold their several forms and shapes,
their order and motion. This same Tub being filled
with <hi>sweet milk,</hi> I found very few Bubbles in it, when by
the exsuctions, it began to subside. I likewise took a little
Glass-viol, and fill'd the half of it full with common Ale,
and set it within the <hi>Receiver.</hi> At the first exsuction,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:106992:134"/>
Bubbles of Air began to rise out of it. At the second and
third, they did so multiply, that they fill'd the other half
of the Glass, and ran over, as a Pot doth when it boileth.
And before I could exhaust all the Air out of it, moe than
20 exsuctions passed.</p>
               <p>For a fifth trial, I filled the often mentioned Pipe with
Fountain-water, and when it began to subside by Pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I found it leave much Air behind it. But all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suctions
I made, could not make the Water of the Pipe
go so low, as the stagnant Water, by which impediment,
I could Pump no Air out of the Pipe, as I did, while I made
use of <hi>Brandy.</hi> This tell us, that either there is not so
much Air lurking among <hi>Water,</hi> as among <hi>Brandy,</hi> or that
the Air among this, hath a more expansive faculty in it,
than the Air that lurks among <hi>Water.</hi> If any think, that it
is not true and real Air, which comes from the <hi>Brandy,</hi> but
rather the <hi>Spirits</hi> of it, which evaporats. I answer, if a man
tast this <hi>Brandy</hi> that's exhausted of its <hi>aërial particles,</hi> he
will find it as strong, as before, which could not be, if the
<hi>Spirits</hi> were gone,</p>
               <p>For a sixth trial, I took a <hi>Frog</hi> and inclosed her within
the <hi>Receiver.</hi> But all the exsuctions I was able to make,
could not so much as trouble her. Only, when the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver</hi>
was exhausted, I perceived her sides to swell very
big, and when the <hi>Stop-cock</hi> was turned, to let in the Air
again, her sides clapped closs together. I observed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
when the Air was pretty well Pumped out, that the
<hi>Frog</hi> had no respirations, or if there were any, they were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
insensible. The next day, after she had been prisoner
in the <hi>Receiver</hi> 24 hours, I began again to Pump, and
after several exsuctions, her sides swell'd pretty great, and
I perceived her open her mouth wide, and somewhat like a
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:106992:135"/>
Bag endeavouring to come out, which surely hath been
some of her noble parts, striving to dilate themselves, the
body being freed of all Pressure from the ambient Air.</p>

               <p>TAke a slender chord, about 4 or 5 yards in length,
and fasten the middle of it to the seiling of a Room
with a nail, so that the two ends of it may hang down equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Take next a piece of Wood, two or three foot long,
two inches broad, and one inch thick, and boring an hole
in each end of it, put through the two ends of the chord,
and fasten them with knots; but so, that the piece of
Wood may ly Horizontal, and be in a manner a <hi>Pendulum</hi>
to swing from the one end of the Chamber to the other.
Take next a Bullet of Lead or Iron, about 20 or 24
ounces, and lay it upon the said piece of Wood: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it cannot well ly, without falling off, therefore nail
upon the ends, and the sides of the Timber, four pieces of
Sticks, on each end one, and on each side one, as <hi>Ledgets,</hi>
for keeping the Bullet from falling off. All things being
thus ordered, draw up the piece of Wood towards the one
side of the Room, by which means losing its horizontal
position, it will ly declining-wise, like the roof of an house.
In this position, lay the Iron Bullet in the upmost end of
it, and then let them both pass from your fingers, the one
end of the Wood going foremost, and you will find it swing
towards the other side of the house, and return again, as a
<hi>Pendulum.</hi> This motion, if the Wood be well guided in
its vibrations, will last perpetually, because in its moving
down, the Bullet is hurled from the one end of the Wood,
to the other, and hits it so smartly, that it begets in it,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:106992:135"/>
an impulse, whereby it is carried farder up, than it would
be, without it. By this means, the <hi>vibrations</hi> get not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to diminish, but all of them are kept of the same
length. In the second vibration, the same Bullet is hurl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
back again to the other end, and hiting it with all its
weight, creats a second impulse, wherewith the Wood is
carried, as far up as the point it was first demitted from.</p>
               <p>Though this may seem a pretty device to please the
fancy, that's many times deceived, while things are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to it, by way of speculation, yet upon tryal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
there will be found, an unspeakeable difficulty:
and it's such an one, that a man would not readily think
upon. I said, that when the Wood was let go, and was
in passing down, the Bullet in it, would hurl down, and
hit the oppsite end, and beget an impulse; but there is
no such thing, for verily, though the Bullet be laid upon
a very declining plain Board, whereupon no man could
imagine a round body could ly, yet all the time the Board
is in swinging, from the one side of the Chamber, to the
other, and consequently, sometimes under an horizontal,
and somtimes under an declining position, the Bullet lies
dead in the place, where you first placed it. This Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is not so much for a perpetual motion, as for find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the reason of this pretty <hi>Phenomenon,</hi> namely,
what's the cause, why the Bullet, that cannot ly upon a
reclining Board, while it's without motion, shall now ly
upon it, while it's under motion? What is more difficult,
and nice, to ly upon any thing, that declines from a levell,
than <hi>Quick-silver;</hi> yet lay never so much of it upon this
Board, while it is swinging, it shall ly dead, and without
motion. But no sooner you stop the motion of the wood,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:106992:136"/>
but assoon, the Bullet, or the <hi>Quick-silver,</hi> is hurled,
either this way, or that way.</p>

               <head>OBSERVATON XII.</head>
               <p>I Find it mentioned by some learned persons, that when
a Ship is under Sail, if a stone be demitted from the top
of the Mast, it will move down in a line parallel with it, and
fall at the root. Some might think, it ought not to fall
directly above the place it hang over, but rather some
distance behind, seing the Ship hath advanced so much
bounds, in the time, wherein the stone is coming down.
Likewise, while a Ship is under Sail, let a man throw up a
stone never so high, and never so perpendicular, as to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
yet it will fall down directly upon his head
again, notwithstanding that the Ship hath run (perhaps)
her own length in the time, while the stone was ascending
and descending. This experiment I find to hold true,
which may be easily tryed, especially when a man is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a Boat upon smooth Water, drawn by a horse, as is
done in some places abroad. Let him therefore throw up
a little Stone, or any heavy Body, and he will find it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
just upon his head, notwithstanding that the Horse
that draggs the Boat, be under a gallop, and by this means
hath advanced ten or twelve paces in the time. Or while
the Boat is thus running, let a man throw a stone towards
the brink of the VVater; in this case he shall not hit the
place he aimed at, but some other place more forward.
This lets us see, that when a Gun is fired in a Ship under
Sail, the Bullet cannot hit the place it was directed to.
Neither can a man riding with a full Career, and shooting
a Pistol, hit the person he aims at, but must surely miss
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:106992:136"/>
him, notwithstanding, that though in the very instant of
time wherein he fires, the mouth of the Pistol was most
justly directed. For remedy whereof, allowance must be
granted in the aiming at the mark.</p>
               <p>VVhile a man throws up a stone in a Ship under Sail, it
must receive two distinct impulses, one from the hand,
whereby it is carried upward, the other from the Ship,
whereby it is carried forward. By this means, the stone in
going up, and coming down, cannot describe a perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
but a crooked Line, either a <hi>Parabola,</hi> or a Line
very like unto it. Neither can it describe a perpendicular
Line, in coming down from the top of the Mast, though
in appearance it seem to do so, but a crooked one, which
in effect must be the half of that, which it describes in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up, and coming down. For this same cause a stone thrown
<hi>horizontally,</hi> or towards the brink of the VVater, must
describe a crooked Line also. And a <hi>Pistol Bullet</hi> shot,
while a man is riding at a full Carreer, must describe a Line
of the same kind. Note, that a man walking from the <hi>Stern</hi>
of a Ship to the <hi>Head,</hi> walks a longer way, than in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the <hi>Head</hi> to the <hi>Stern.</hi> Secondly, a man may
walk from the <hi>Head</hi> to the <hi>Stern,</hi> and yet not change his
place. 'Tis observable, that a man <hi>under board,</hi> will not
perceive whether the Ship be sailing, or not, and cannot
know when her <hi>Head</hi> goes about. And it is strange, that
when a man is inclosed in a <hi>Hogs-head,</hi> though he have
light with him, yet let him be never so oft whirled about,
he shall not know, whether he be going about, or not.</p>

shour of <hi>hail,</hi> with thunder and rain. It came from the
South-west, with a great blast of wind, and ran alongs from
<hi>Picts-land-hills</hi> North-east, towards the Sea coast. The
<hi>hail</hi> were big in several places, as <hi>Musquet Ball,</hi> and many of
them rather <hi>oval</hi> than <hi>round.</hi> Some persons suffered great
loss of their <hi>young Pease;</hi> others of their <hi>Glass Windows.</hi>
Eight or ten days before, there was a considerable heat,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:106992:138"/>
and dry VVeather. For 20 dayes after, cold Easterly
winds, with rain every day, but especially, in the end of
the Moneth, extraordinary rain and mist. This is so much
the more to be observed, because in this Countrey, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
such extraordinary <hi>hail</hi> falls out. This year the <hi>Agues</hi>
and <hi>Trembling Fevers</hi> have been most frequent, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
deadly.</p>

               <head>OBSERVATION XVIII.</head>
               <p>I Did hear lately of a curious Experiment in <hi>Germany,</hi>
made by a Person of note, which I shall briefly in this
Observation, let the <hi>Reader</hi> understand. And though I
have heard since, that it is now published in Print, yet I
hope it will not be impertinent to mention it here, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for their cause, who cannot conveniently come to the
knowledge of such things. And for this reason also, that
I may explicat the <hi>Phenomena</hi> thereof, from the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
doctrine, and demonstrat particularly the true cause of
that admirable effect, that's seen in it, which I desiderat in
the publisher. The Auctor then takes two <hi>Vessels</hi> of
<hi>Brass,</hi> each one of them in form of half a sphere, of a pretty
large size. Nothing can more fitly represent them for
form and quantity, than two <hi>Bee-skeps.</hi> Only, each of
them, hath a strong <hi>Ring</hi> of Brass upon the <hi>Center</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:
and they are so contrived by the <hi>Artist,</hi> that their
orifices agree most exactly, so that when they are united,
they represent an intire Sphere almost. In one of the sides,
there's a hole, and a <hi>Brass Spigot</hi> in it, through which the
whole <hi>Air</hi> within, is exsucted, and drawn out, namely by
the help of the <hi>Air-pump.</hi> And, when by several exsucti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the <hi>Vessels</hi> are made empty, the <hi>Stop-cock</hi> is turned
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:106992:138"/>
about, by which means, no <hi>Air</hi> can come in. And, they
remaining empty, are taken from the <hi>Pump,</hi> and do cleave
so fast together, that though a number of <hi>lusty fellows,</hi> 12
on each side, do pull vigorously, by help of ropes fastned
to the <hi>Rings,</hi> yet are they not able to pull them asunder.
And because this will not do it, he yokes in 12 <hi>Coach
Horses,</hi> six on every side, yet are they not sufficient, though
they pull contrariwise to other, to make a separation. But
to let the <hi>Spectators</hi> see, that they may be pulled asunder,
he yokes in 9 or 10 on every side, and then after much
whipping, and sweating, they pull the one from the
other.</p>
               <p>The cause of this admirable effect, is not the fear of <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity,</hi>
as some do fancy, for if that were, all the <hi>Horses</hi> in
<hi>Germany</hi> would not pull them asunder, no not the strength
of <hi>Angels.</hi> It must then be some extrinsick weight and
force, that keeps them together, which can be nothing
else, but the weight of the <hi>invironing Air.</hi> Because, no
sooner a force is applied, that's more powerful, than the
weight of the <hi>Air,</hi> but assoon they come asunder. And
so neither six men, nor six horses on each side are able to
do it: but nine or ten on each side makes a separation. For
understanding the true cause of this <hi>Phenomenon,</hi> we must
consider that the <hi>Vessels</hi> are 18 inches in <hi>diameter.</hi> I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> this
be, then according to the last Experiment, there are two
Pillars of <hi>Air,</hi> each one of them as heavy as a Pillar of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
18 inches thick, and 29 inches long, by which they
are united. Or, each Pillar of <hi>Air,</hi> is as heavy, as a Pillar
0<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Water</hi> 34 foot high, and 18 inches in <hi>diameter.</hi> For
finding the weight of it in pounds, and consequently, the
weight of each Pillar of <hi>Air,</hi> by which the two <hi>Vessels</hi> are
united, follow this method<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> First, multiply 9 the semi-diameter
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:106992:139"/>
of the <hi>Pillar,</hi> by 54 the circumference, and this
gives you 486, the half whereof is the bounds of the <hi>Area,</hi>
namely 243. And because 34 foot contains 408 inches,
I multiply 408 by 243, the product whereof is 99144; so
many square inches are in a Pillar of Water 34 foot high,
and 18 inches thick. Now seing there are 1728 inches
in a <hi>cubical foot,</hi> I divide the number 99144, by this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and I find 57 square foot of Water, and more. And
because every square foot weighs 56 pound <hi>Trois,</hi> I multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
56 by the number 57, and the product is 3192 pound,
which is the just weight of a Pillar of <hi>Water</hi> 34 foot high,
and 18 inches in diameter, and which is the just weight al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of each Pillar of <hi>Air,</hi> by which the two <hi>Vessels</hi> are kept
together, which will be more weight than <hi>seven Hogs-heads
full of Water.</hi> This is easily known; for seing a quart
of our measure weighs seven pound, (or to speak strictly
six pound fourteen ounces, seing the <hi>Standard-jug</hi> of <hi>Stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling</hi>
contains three pound seven ounces of Water) a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
must weigh 28 pound: but 16 times 28, is 448. A
<hi>Puncheon</hi> then full of Water, weighs 448 pound. If then
you divide 3192 by 448, you will find more than 7. The
9 horses then upon this side have 3192 pound weight to
draw, or 199 stone, or the weight of <hi>seven Hogs-heads
full of Water.</hi> The other 9 horses upon the other side, have
as much to pull. 'Tis no wonder then to see so much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
and pains to make a separation. It is observed, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Air</hi> be exsucted and drawn out of the two <hi>Vessels,</hi>
one man is able to pull them asunder with his hands only.
Nay, which is more, if he but blow into them, as a man doth
into a Bladder, he will separat them. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>Air</hi> within, is of as great force, as the <hi>Air</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.
'Tis observable next, that the larger the <hi>Vessels</hi> be
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:106992:139"/>
in <hi>diameter,</hi> the more strength is required to pull the one
from the other. Upon supposition then, they were 4 foot
wide, I verily believe 30 yoke of oxen, upon every side,
would hardly disjoyn them; because the weight of each
Pillar of Air, would be no less, than 22844 pound, which
would take 63 strong horses to overcome the force of it.
To pull the one <hi>Vessel</hi> therefore from the other, there must
be 126 horses, that is, 63 on every side.</p>

               <head>OBSERVATION XIX.</head>
               <p>THough this Observation may seem useless, because the
Proposals, that are mentioned in it, cannot be made
out, and brought to pass, the <hi>Author</hi> having died, before he
had encouragment to prosecute them: yet for these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
reasons, I have adventured to insert it here. First,
that others, may either be minded to find out (if possible)
his inventions, or set a work to find out somethings, that
may be as useful. Next, because, he was one of this same
<hi>Nation,</hi> and a great <hi>Master</hi> of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> not only
in the <hi>Speculative,</hi> but in the <hi>Practical</hi> part chiefly, and
admirable for invention. And for this cause principally I
have presumed to mention his designs, and proposals, which
were found among his <hi>Notes,</hi> after his death, which are
here insert, as they were written with his own hand, and
offered to the publick, not only at home, but abroad to
strangers. There have been men in all ages famous, for
some one Art and Science beyond others, as <hi>Apelles</hi> for
Painting, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> for Medicine, <hi>Demosthenes</hi> for Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
but who have been more famous in their time than
some persons for their profound knowledge in <hi>Astronomy,
Geometry,</hi> and the other parts of the <hi>Mathematicks.</hi> What
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:106992:140"/>
an admirable person was <hi>Archimedes</hi> for his divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
both in the <hi>Speculative,</hi> and <hi>Practical</hi> part. Yet,
it was not his speculations simply, though excellent, that
did so much commend him, as his <hi>Inventions,</hi> and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Engines</hi> for peace and war, as is clear from the <hi>Romane
Histories,</hi> and others. I confess the Students of these Arts,
are not so much in request now, at least amongst some, and
that knowledge is not so much esteemed; and the reason
may be; because some who profess themselves <hi>great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi>
study nothing but the pure speculations, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
are to small purpose, others before knowing the same,
unless for perfecting of the mind, and giving to a man some
private satisfaction. But such things will never commend
a man so much as the practical part, and new Invention will
do. 'Tis surely a small business for one to do nothing, but
to nibble at some petty Demonstration. But when such
speculations are joyned with invention and practice, for the
profit, and use of men, among whom they live, then are
they far more to be commended. And if this be not, such
knowledge is of small advantage to themselves or others.
Many of the Ancient, and late Astronomers have been, and
are famous for practice, as witness the indefatigable pains
they have been at in making their Observations. What
hath so highly commended <hi>Merchiston</hi> over all <hi>Europe,</hi> as
his inventions, especially his <hi>Logarithmes?</hi> And if all be
true, that's reported (which I am apt to believe) he might
have been more renowned, for his many excellent <hi>Engines,</hi>
which though useful, yet because hurtful to mankind, he
buried with himself. I am confident, if the Author of
these proposals had had time to have prosecuted them, he
would have been celebrated in the Catalogue of the most
famous <hi>Mathematicians</hi> of his time. But leaving this, I
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:106992:140"/>
shall give you them in his own words: but first his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</p>
               <p>These bold proposals will need perhaps an apology to
such, to whom the causes, and circumstances are unknown.
Let it suffice, that the Proposer finding himself between
two extreams, either to leave unprosecuted this affair, for
fear of being mistaken by some, as impudent, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
himself openly to the charitable judgement of others,
who will suspend their censure, till they have seen what his
endeavours will produce. He hath rather chosen this last,
especially considering, that his silence could not answer to
his duty, which he owes to his Countreys service, seing
the following Engines may be so useful to it. A deduction
of the fabrick, causes, and occasions of these <hi>new Engines,</hi>
that set the Inventer a-work, would take a long time to
discourse upon. This Paper therefore is only destined for
a short information of their use, the rest, which could not
here be insert without impertinency, may be supplied af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
(if need be) either by a discourse, or by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
demonstration. The Proposer then is of opinion, (if
self-love of his own Inventions do not blind his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
that these <hi>paradoxes</hi> may be truly affirmed.</p>
               <p>That if it shall please His Majesty to arm with these new
Arms, and Engines, 500 Foot, or fewer, this small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
shall be Masters of the Fields in <hi>France, Germany, Spain,</hi>
or where else it shall please His Majesty, however encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by the most powerful Army of Horse or Foot, armed
with ordinary Arms, of Pistol, Carabine, Pike, Musquet,
which Europe can bring to the Fields.</p>
               <p>The cause of this admirable effect, is in the quality of
these new Arms, by which, the whole Horsemen and Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the enemy are rendred useless, and unservicable;
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:106992:141"/>
neither can they do any offence to these, who are so
armed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Musquetteers,</hi> who can only serve against these <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins,</hi>
shall be put to such disadvantage, as it is impossible
they can stand, the least time, in the common way of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
with the <hi>Musquet,</hi> it not being able to make one shot
for twenty, which shall be made from these new Engines.</p>
               <p>These <hi>new Arms,</hi> have this advantage likewise, that
these who are so armed, can by no force of Horse or Foot
be broken, or put to disorder. The Souldiers are also by
them put to a necessity of keeping together, and fighting,
and by them, they are so <hi>Baricado'd,</hi> and strongly defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that if they leave them not, they cannot be exposed
to danger. This contributes much to good Discipline,
when the Souldiers shall by necessity be tied to his duty,
and fear, which otherwise makes him run away, shall here
for his safety make him stand.</p>
               <p>These <hi>new Arms</hi> are useful, as well in Marching, as in
Combating, for with them, we may march securely two
in front, through the straitest passages, and be able to force
with them any advantage a strait passage can give to an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Besides, for a long hasty march, where Victuals can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be well carried, the Souldiers are able with these <hi>Arms</hi>
to carry their own provision for eight dayes, with more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility,
then they can now carry one dayes provision.</p>
               <p>To lodge in the open fields, these <hi>Arms</hi> shall need no
Intrenching, for they sufficiently both Arm and <hi>Baricade</hi>
the Souldiers.</p>
               <p>And as they are useful in Service, so are they a great deal
cheaper than the ordinary <hi>Arms.</hi> For although with
5 thousand men so armed, the service of 100000 armed
with common Arms may be done, yet the whole price of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:106992:141"/>
them will not amount to that which will be required for
arming 20500 <hi>Corrassiers,</hi> as may be particularly deduced,
from the particular prices of the Arms, and Engines fitted
for the service of 5000 men. The Proposet doth offer to
shew, that these Arms will not surmount 40000 pound
<hi>Sterling.</hi> The <hi>Artillery</hi> will amount to 4500, and the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of this number of men so armed, yearly to 70000
pound. Yet all these are taken in so large a latitude of
reckoning, as the sum of <hi>Arms, Artillery,</hi> and payments,
will not be much above 130000 pound <hi>Sterling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Arms from which this effect is promised, are <hi>new
Engines,</hi> with which one man is able to do the service of
a great many <hi>Musquetteers.</hi> And those are of two sorts,
either to be used upon a small Wagon for Footmen, or on
a greater for a Horse, with either of which, one hand is
able to make the fire of 100 <hi>Musquetteers,</hi> and so much
better, by how much it is more regularly, and fitly done
for execution and offence. The new Cannon shall have
the like advantage above the old, both for easie carriage,
being lighter, and for greater execution, shooting six, nine,
or twelve Bullets for one. These Arms give not only
this advantage at Land in the field, but also in Ships, and
places of defence.</p>
               <p>These nine following propositions he likewise offered to
make good,</p>
               <p>First, With one shot of <hi>Cannon,</hi> to do the execution of
five shot of the same <hi>Cannon,</hi> in the common way of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to disable any Ship or Galley with one shot of
<hi>Cannon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, to fire any combustible matter with the shot of
a <hi>Cannon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:106992:142"/>
Fourthly, to make an <hi>Machin</hi> or <hi>Engine</hi> for transporting
an Army, which may be carried without the incommodity
thereof.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, to make a flotting <hi>Fortress</hi> for defence of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and prohibition of Passages.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, to make a <hi>Mortar</hi> that hath a <hi>directory Stell</hi>
upon the Carriage.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, to make <hi>Petards</hi> of divers forms, that shall
be able to do twice as much execution, as those that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
as much Powder.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, to make small <hi>Petards</hi> of great effect.</p>
               <p>Lastly, to make <hi>Bridges,</hi> and <hi>Scaling Ladders</hi> of easie
Carriage.</p>

               <p>THese Observations being <hi>Miscellany,</hi> require not a

'tis no matter what method I keep in setting them

others, yet because the design of it is only <hi>Philosophical,</hi>
and for advancing the <hi>Historical</hi> part of Learning in order
to <hi>Spirits,</hi> upon which the <hi>Scientifical</hi> part doth so much
depend, I have presumed to insert it here, considering al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that there are some, who have adventured to deny their
existence. and being; which from such a History as this,
may be more than probably evicted. I find likewise, that
several Writers have remarked such strange accidents, and
have transmitted them to posterity, which may serve for
good use. The subject-matter then of this Observation,
is a true and short account of a remarkable trial, wherewith
the Family of one <hi>Gilbert Compbel,</hi> by Profession a Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:106992:142"/>
in the old Paroch of <hi>Glenl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>e</hi> in <hi>Galloway,</hi> was exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised.
Though the matter be well known to several persons
at that time, and since too; yet there are others, eighteen
years interveening, to whom (perhaps) such a relation
will not be unacceptable, who have either not as yet heard
of it, or at least, have not gotten the true information,
which is here set down, as it was Written, at the desire of
a special Friend, by <hi>Gilbert Campbel</hi>'s own Son, who knew
exactly the matter, and all the circumstances, whose words
are as follows.</p>
               <p>It happened in <hi>October</hi> 1654, that after one <hi>Alexander
Agnew,</hi> a bold and sturdy Beggar, who afterwards was
hanged at <hi>Dumfreis</hi> for blasphemy, had threatned hurt to
the Family, because he had not gotten such an alms as he
required: the said <hi>Gilbert</hi> was oftentimes hindered in the
exercise of his Calling, all his Working-Instruments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some of them broken, some of them cutted, and yet
could not know by what means this hurt was done; which
piece of trouble did continue, till about the middle of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi>
at which time the Devil came with new and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
assaults, by throwing of Stones in at Doors and
Windows, and down thorow the Chimney-head, which
were of great quantity, and thrown with great force,
yet by <hi>Gods</hi> good providence, there was not one person of
the Family hurt, or suffered damage thereby. This
piece of new and sore trouble, did necessitat Mr. <hi>Campbel</hi>
to reveal that to the <hi>Minister</hi> of the Paroch, and to some
other Neighbours and Friends, which hitherto he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
secretly. Yet notwithstanding of this, his trouble
was enlarged; for not long after, he found oftentimes his
Warp and Threeds cut, as with a pair of Sizzers, and the
<hi>Reed</hi> broken: and not only this, but their apparel cut af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:106992:143"/>
the same manner, even while they were wearing them,
their Coats, Bonnets, Hose, Shooes, but could not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
how, or by what mean. Only it pleased <hi>God</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their persons, that the least harm was not done. Yet,
in the night time, they wanted liberty to sleep, something
coming, and pulling their Bed-cloaths and Linnings off
them, and leaving their bodies naked. Next, their Chests,
and Trunks were opened, and all things in them strawed
here and there. Likewise, the parts of the Working In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
that had escaped, were carried away, and hid
in holes and bores of the house, where hardly they could
be found again. Nay, what-ever piece of Cloath, or
Houshold-stuff, was in any part of the house, it was carried
away, and so cut and abused, that the Good-man was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
with all haste and speed, to remove, and to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the rest to a Neighbours house, and he himself com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to quite the exercise of his Calling, whereby only
he maintained his Family. Yet, he resolved to remain in
the house for a season. During which time, some persons
about, not very judicious, counselled him to send his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
out of the Family, here and there, to try whom the
trouble did most follow, assuring him, that this trouble
was not against all the Family, but against some one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or other in it, whom he too willingly obeyed. Yet,
for the space of four or five dayes after, there were no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
assaults, as before. The Minister hearing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
shewed him the evil of such a course, and assured him,
that if he repented not, and called back his children, he
might not expect that his trouble would end in a right way.
The children that were nigh by, being called home, no
trouble followed, till one of his sons, called <hi>Thomas,</hi> that
was farrest off, came home. Then did the Devil begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh;
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:106992:143"/>
for upon the <hi>Lords Day</hi> following, in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
the house was set on fire, but by his providence, and
the help of some people, going home from Sermon, the
fire was extinguished, and the house saved, not much loss
being done. And the <hi>Monday</hi> after, being spent in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat
Prayer and Fasting, the house was again set on fire
upon the <hi>Tuesday</hi> about nine a Clock in the morning, yet
by providence, and the help of Neighbours, it was saved,
before any harm was done.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Campbel,</hi> being thus wearied, and vexed, both in
the day, and in the night time, went to the <hi>Minister,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
him, to let his son <hi>Thomas</hi> abide with him for a time,
who condescended, but withal assured him, that he would
find himself deceived, and so it came to pass: for, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that the child was without the family, yet were
they, that remained in it, fore troubled both in the day
time, and in the night season, so that they were forced to
wake till mid-night, and sometimes all the night over.
During which time, the persons within the Family, suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many losses, as the cutting of their Cloaths, the throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Peits, the pulling down of Tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ff, and Feal from the
Roof, and Walls of the House, and the stealing of their
Apparel, and the pricking of their flesh and skin with Pins.
The <hi>Presbytery</hi> having conveened at the place, for a solemn
Humiliation, perswaded <hi>Gilbert Campbel</hi> to call back his
Son <hi>Thomas,</hi> notwithstanding of whatsoever hazard might
follow. The Boy returning home, affirmed that he heard
a voice speak to him, forbidding him to enter within the
house, or into any other place where his Fathers Calling
was exercised. Yet he entered, but was sore abused, till
he was forced to return to the <hi>Ministers</hi> house again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Upon</hi> Monday <hi>the 12 of</hi> February, <hi>the rest of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:106992:144"/>
began to hear a voice speak to them, but could not well
know from whence it came. Yet, from evening till mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
too much vain discourse was kept up with the</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
<hi>and many idle and impertinent questions proposed,
without that due fear of</hi> God, <hi>that should have been upon
their Spirits, under so rare and extraordinary a trial. The</hi>
Minister <hi>hearing of this, went to the house upon the</hi> Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
<hi>being accompanied with some Gentle-men, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Prayer was ended, heard a voice speaking out of the
ground, from under a bed, in the proper Countrey Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
saying,</hi> Would ye know the <hi>Witches</hi> of <hi>Glenluce?</hi> I
will tell you them; <hi>and so related four or five persons names,
that went under an evil report. The said</hi> Gilbert <hi>informed
the company,</hi> That one of them was dead long ago. <hi>The</hi>
Devil <hi>answered, and said,</hi> It is true, she is dead long ago,
yet her spirit is living with us in the world. <hi>The Minister
replied, saying, (though it was not convenient to speak
to such a person)</hi> The Lord rebuke thee Satan, and put thee
to silence; we are not to receive any information from thee,
whatsoever fame any persons go under. Thou art but seeking
to seduce this Family: for <hi>Satans</hi> Kingdom is not divided
against it self. <hi>After which all went to Prayer again, which
being ended (for during the time of Prayer no trouble was
made) the</hi> Devil <hi>with many threatnings boasted and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
the Lad</hi> Thomas, <hi>who had come back that day with
the</hi> Minister, that if he did not depart out of the house, he
would set all on fire. <hi>The</hi> Minister <hi>answered, and said,</hi> The
Lord will preserve the House, and the Boy too, seing he is one
of the Family, and hath Gods warrand to tarry in it. <hi>The</hi>
Devil <hi>answered,</hi> He shall not get liberty to stay: he was once
put out already, and shall not abide here, though I should pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
him to the end of the world. <hi>The</hi> Minister <hi>replied,</hi> The
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:106992:144"/>
Lord will stop thy malice against him. <hi>And then they all
prayed again, which being ended, the</hi> Devil <hi>said,</hi> Give
me a Spade and a Shovel, and depart from the house for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
dayes, and I shall make a grave, and ly down in it, and
shall trouble you no more. <hi>The</hi> Good-man <hi>answered,</hi> Not so
much as a Straw shall be given thee, through Gods assistance,
even though that would do it. <hi>The</hi> Minister <hi>also added,</hi>
God shall remove thee in due time. <hi>The</hi> Devil <hi>answered,</hi> I
will not remove for you, I have my Commission from Christ
to tarry, and vex this Family. <hi>The</hi> Minister <hi>answered,</hi>
A permission thou hast indeed, but God will stop it in due time.
<hi>The</hi> Devil <hi>replied,</hi> I have (<hi>Mes.</hi> Iohn) a Commission,
that (perhaps) will last longer than your own. <hi>After which,
the</hi> Minister <hi>and the</hi> Gentlemen <hi>arose, and went to the
place where the voice seemed to come from, to try if they
could find any thing. And after diligent search, nothing
being found, the</hi> Gentlemen <hi>began to say,</hi> We think this
voice speaks out of the children, <hi>for some of them were in
their beds. The</hi> Devil <hi>answered,</hi> You lie, God shall judge
you for your lying, and I and my Father will come and fetch
you to hell, with <hi>Warlock-theeves; and so the</hi> Devil <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
the</hi> Gentlemen <hi>to speak any, saying,</hi> Let him speak
that hath a Commission (<hi>meaning the</hi> Minister) for he is
the Servant of God. <hi>The</hi> Gentlemen <hi>returning back with
the</hi> Minister, <hi>they sat down near to the place whence the
voice seemed to come from, and he opening his mouth,
spake to them, after this manner.</hi> The Lord will rebuke
this Spirit, in his own time, and cast it out. <hi>The</hi> Devil
<hi>answering, said,</hi> It is written in the 9 of <hi>Mark,</hi> the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
could not cast him out. <hi>The</hi> Minister <hi>replied,</hi> What
the Disciples could not do, yet the Lord having hightned the
Parents faith, for his own glory did cast him out, and so shall
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:106992:145"/>
he thee. <hi>The</hi> Devil <hi>replied,</hi> It is written in the 4 of <hi>Luke,</hi>
And he departed, and left him for a season. <hi>The</hi> Minister
<hi>said,</hi> The Lord in the dayes of his humiliation, not only got
the victory over Satan, in that assault in the wilderness, but
when he came again, his success was no better, for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 14. Behold the Prince of this world cometh, and
hath nothing in me; and being now in glory, he will fulfill
his promise, and God shall bruise Satan under your feet short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Rom. 16. The</hi> Devil <hi>answered,</hi> It is written, <hi>Mat.
25.</hi> There were ten Virgins, five wise, and five foolish; and
the Bridegroom came: The foolish Virgins had no Oyl in their
Lamps, and they went unto the wise to seek Oyl; and the wise
said, Go and buy for your selves: and while they went, the
Bridegroom came, and entered in, and the door was shut, and
the foolish Virgins were sent to hells fire. <hi>The</hi> Minister <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,</hi>
The Lord knows the sincerity of his servants, and
though there be sin and folly in us here, yet there is a fountain
opened to the house of <hi>David</hi> for sin and for uncleanness, and
when he hath washed us there, and pardoned all our sins, for
his Names sake, he will cast the unclean spirit out of the land.
<hi>The</hi> Devil <hi>answered and said,</hi> That place of Scripture is
written in the 13 of <hi>Zechariah,</hi> In that day I will cause the
Prophets, and the unclean spirit, pass out of the land; but
afterwards it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the
Sheep shall be scattered. <hi>The</hi> Minister <hi>answered and said,</hi>
Well are we, that our blessed Shepherd was smitten, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
hath bruised thy head; and albeit in the hour of his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
his Disciples forsook him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. yet now having
ascended on high, he sits in glory, and is preserving, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in, and turning his hand upon his little ones, and will
save his poor ones in this Family from thy malice. <hi>The</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
<hi>returning back a little, and standing upon the floor,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:106992:145"/>
the</hi> Devil <hi>said,</hi> I knew not these Scriptures, till my Father
taught me them. I am an evil Spirit, and Satan is my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and I am come to vex this house; <hi>and presently there
appeared a naked hand, and an arm, from the elbow down,
beating upon the floor, till the house did shake again; and
also the</hi> Devil <hi>uttered a most fearful and loud cry, saying,</hi>
Come up Father, come up: I will send my father among you.
See, there he is behind your backs. <hi>The</hi> Minister <hi>said,</hi>
I saw indeed an hand, and an arm, when the stroak was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and heard. <hi>The</hi> Devil <hi>said to him,</hi> Saw you that?
It was not my hand, it was my fathers; my hand is more
bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ck in the loof. Would you see me? Put out the candle
then, and I shall come butt the house among you like fire-balls.
<hi>After which all went to Prayer, during which time, it did
no harm, neither at any other time when</hi> God <hi>was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped.
When Prayer was ended, the</hi> Devil <hi>answered
and said, Mes John,</hi> if the Good-mans sons prayers at the
Colledge of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> did not prevail more with God, than
yours, my father and I had wrought a mischief here ere now.
<hi>To which one of the Gentlemen replied, though a check
had been given him before,</hi> Well well, I see you confess
there is a God, and that prayer prevails with him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must pray to God, and will commit the event to him.
<hi>To which the</hi> Devil <hi>replied,</hi> Yea Sir, you speak of prayer,
with your broad lipped Hat <hi>(for the Gentleman had lately
gotten a new Hat in the fashion with broad lips)</hi> I'le bring
a pair of Shears from my father, that shall clip the lips of
it a little.</p>
               <p>The night now being far spent, it was thought fit every
one should withdraw to his own home. Then did the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>
cry out fearfully, <hi>Let not the Minister go home, I shall
burn the house if he go;</hi> and many other wayes did he
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:106992:146"/>
threaten. And after the <hi>Minister</hi> was gone forth, the
<hi>Good-man</hi> being instant with him to tarry, whereupon he
returned, all the rest of the company going home. Then
said the <hi>Devil</hi> to the <hi>Minister, You have done my bidding.
Not thine,</hi> answered he, <hi>but in obedience to God, have I
returned to bear this man company, whom thou dost afflict.</hi>
Then did the <hi>Minister</hi> call upon the Name of <hi>God,</hi> and
when Prayer was ended, he discharged Mr. <hi>Campbel,</hi> and
all the persons of the Family, from opening their mouth,
in one word to the <hi>evil spirit,</hi> and when it spake, that they
should only kneel down, and speak to God. The <hi>Devil</hi>
then roared mightily, and cryed out, <hi>What? Will ye not
speak to me? I shall burn the house, I shall strike the bairns,
and do all manner of mischief.</hi> But after that time, no
answer was made to it, and so for a long time no speech was
heard. After this, the said <hi>Gilbert</hi> suffered much loss, and
had many sad nights, not two nights in one week free; and
thus it continued till <hi>April.</hi> From <hi>April</hi> to <hi>Iuly,</hi> he had
some respite, and ease. But after, he was molested with
new assaults: and even their Victuals were so abused, that
the Family was in hazard of starving; and that which they
did eat, gave them not the ordinary satisfaction they were
wont to find.</p>
               <p>In this sore and sad affliction, Mr. <hi>Campbel</hi> resolved to
make his address to the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> for advice and
counsel what to do, which was appointed to conveen in
<hi>October</hi> 1655, namely whether to forsake the house and
place, or not? The <hi>Synod</hi> by their Committee, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to meet at <hi>Glenluce</hi> in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1656, thought fit, that a
solemn Humiliation should be kept thorow all the bounds
of the <hi>Synod,</hi> and amongst other causes, to request <hi>God</hi> in
behalf of that poor afflicted Family, which being carefully
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:106992:146"/>
done, the event was, through the Prayers of his People,
that his trouble grew less till <hi>April,</hi> and from <hi>April</hi> to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi>
he was altogether free. About which time, the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>
began with new assaults, and taking the ready meat
that was in the house, did sometimes hide it in holes by the
door-posts, and at other times did hide it under the beds,
and sometimes among the Bed-cloaths, and under the Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings;
and at last, did carry it quite away, till nothing
was left there, save Bread and Water to live by. After
this, he exercised his malice and cruelty against all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the Family, in wearying them in the night time,
with stirring and moving thorow the house, so that they
had no rest for noise, which continued all the moneth of
<hi>August</hi> after this manner. After which time, the <hi>Devil</hi>
grew yet worse, and began with terrible roarings, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
voices, so that no person could sleep in the house,
in the night time, and sometimes did vex them with cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of stones, striking them with staves on their beds in
the night time: and upon the 18 of <hi>September,</hi> about mid-night,
he cried out with a loud voice, <hi>I shall burn the house;</hi>
and about three or four nights after, he set one of the beds on
fire; which was soon extinguished, without any prejudice,
except the bed it self: and so he continued to vex them.</p>

               <p>I Need not make any apology for inserting this Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
even though it be well known upon the matter in
this place. But because the thing is extraordinary, and
that there are many who have not so much as heard of it, I
have therefore presumed to mention it here. The matter is
shortly this. There's a certain Woman, named <hi>Mistri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Low,</hi> who had a real and true Horn, growing upon the

                  </gap>.
The length of it is eleven inches, and two inches about.
The form is crooked spirally. It is convex on the outer
side, and somewhat guttered in the inner side. It is hard
and solid, and all very near of the same greatness. It is
not hollow within, as horns are ordinarily, but full, yet it
seems to be spongious as a Cane is. It was seven years in
growing, and was cut off in <hi>May</hi> 1671, by <hi>Mr. Temple,</hi>
an expert Chirurgeon here at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>

               <p>THis Observation is for finding the <hi>Primum vivens</hi>
in <hi>Animals.</hi> Albeit I doubt not but the <hi>red Spirit,</hi>
or <hi>Blood,</hi> in most <hi>Terrestrial Animals,</hi> is the first product
of the <hi>Primigenial juice,</hi> and therefore not improperly
named the true <hi>Callidum Innatum</hi> of these Creatures, by
the Noble and Ingenious <hi>Harvey,</hi> in his Book <hi>de Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione.</hi>
Neither do I scruple to yeeld, that the <hi>Heart,</hi> and
appendent Vessels, are the first formed, and perfected parts
in the hotter kind of <hi>Animals:</hi> yet I am confident to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that in many of the colder, and moifter kinds of
<hi>Aquaticks,</hi> if not in all, neither the redness and heat of the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:106992:147"/>
                  <hi>Vital Spirits,</hi> nor the formation of the <hi>Heart, Liver,</hi> &amp;c.
are previously requisite, to the structure and existence of
the other parts; seing the light of life, which at first inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
the clear and Cristalin radical moisture, before the
formation of any particular part, doth alwayes move in
every living creature, according to their particular exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
without any absolute dependency upon any one part,
or member (excepting singular conditions, wherein they
may be stated) as to its substance, light, and motion:
there being in some <hi>Animals</hi> a simple undulation, in others
a slow creeping, but in the more perfect, an impetuous
running, or rather flying of the <hi>Vital Spirits,</hi> necessarily
required for illumination and vivification of the whole.</p>
               <p>For confirmation, I shall give you this singular Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
About the middle of <hi>March,</hi> the sperm of <hi>Frogs</hi>
(according to the number of <hi>Prolifick Eggs</hi> therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
sends forth a multitude of small round Creatures, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with a black, and moveable <hi>Frock,</hi> which about the
end of <hi>March,</hi> and beginning of <hi>April,</hi> by the Gyrations
of a Tail behind, like a Rudder, do slowly move their
bodies in the Water. At this time having opened severals
of them, I found nothing (apparent to the naked eye)
but a clear thin Membran, under the fore-named black
<hi>Frock,</hi> within which were contained a clear Water, and
some small Fibres like Intestines, and in the fore-part a
small orifice like a mouth. About the middle of <hi>April,</hi>
its motion is more vigorous, and the <hi>Tripes</hi> within are
most evident, lying in a very fine circular order, but as yet,
there is no Vestige of <hi>Heart, Blood,</hi> or <hi>Liver,</hi> &amp;c. About
the middle of <hi>May,</hi> the feet formed like small threeds, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
thorow the black <hi>Coat:</hi> within the Breast, the Heart
is then visible, of a white and Fibrous substance, the Liver
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:106992:148"/>
is white, and the Gall therein easily discerned. But (which
is the head of this Experiment) the Vital Spirit, in form
of a clear and pure Water, is manifestly received by the
Nervous Heart, and by the contraction thereof transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to all the Body, thorow white transparent Vessels,
which being full of this Liquor, do represent the <hi>Lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi>
rather than the <hi>Sanguiferous Veins.</hi> Last of all do
the <hi>Pneumatick Vesicles</hi> (which in this <hi>Amphibium</hi> supply
the place of the Lungs) arise in the Breast, after whose
production, the Lympid and Crystalin Liquor, while the
Heart is turgid therewith, seems to be red and fiery, but
in the other Vessels, it is of a faint pale colour, untill
(about, or near the end of <hi>Iune</hi>) the <hi>Frock</hi> being cast off,
and a perfect <hi>Frog</hi> formed, the whole Vessels are full of
Blood, or a red substance very thin, and clear: the Liver,
and <hi>Pneumatick Vesicles,</hi> &amp;c. become red, and Rosy; so
that the Blood in this <hi>Amphibium</hi> (which in the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Animals is first compleat) seems to be the last part in
attaining its perfection.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Salmonds,</hi> and great <hi>Trouts</hi> have an aqueous liquor
which runs thorow their <hi>Arteries,</hi> and <hi>Veins,</hi> before their
Blood attain the true consistency, and saturat tincture I am
certain: whether it hold in many others, I suspect, but dar
not affirm. Hence it may be (if mens observations, were
frequent in all kind of <hi>Anatomical inspections,</hi> in several
<hi>Embryo's</hi> of every <hi>species</hi>) it would be found evident, that
the Blood in all these, called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> hath its immediat origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:106992:148"/>
Whether this Experiment doth not sufficiently impugn
the universality of the hearts first living, the original of the
Gall from the fervour, and ebullition of the Blood, the
production of the Blood by the Liver, and many other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

               <p>Yea, if the aqueous liquor, be not one with the vital
Spirit, and subsequent Blood, then my eyes, and taste are
altogether erroneous.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it were to be wished, that <hi>Physitians</hi> would
not simply stand upon the <hi>Galenick suppositions</hi> of the four
alledged Components of the Blood, nor any such, or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
fancies of the latter <hi>Chymists;</hi> but that they would
seriously examine the first original, and rise thereof from
the <hi>Primigenial juice,</hi> or <hi>liquamen,</hi> the progress, and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its tinctures, how many renovations, or new tinctures
it is capable of; the vast difference between the Blood of
old and young <hi>Animals,</hi> (though, it may be, they are
both <hi>univocal</hi> substances, while in their integrity within
the Vessels) with the <hi>specifick</hi> discriminations, not only
of that of any one <hi>Aquatick,</hi> from any <hi>Volatil,</hi> or <hi>Terrestrial,</hi>
but likewise of any one <hi>Species</hi> living in the same Element,
with these that enjoy the same Aliments, but of a different
<hi>Species.</hi> And lastly, the variety of particular constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and singular properties of individual <hi>Animals,</hi> radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
in the fountain of life, or first original of the Blood.
If these things, and many more, were truly inquired after
(though the Cook be sometimes necessitated to throw
away some of the Broth with the Scum) I doubt not but
the <hi>Neoterick</hi> Invention of <hi>Transfusion of Blood,</hi> would
prove altogether ridiculous, and the ancient mistake of too

much <hi>Profusion</hi> of this treasure by <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> might suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

               <p>THis Observation is concerning the aliment and growth

made many laudable Experiments for finding out the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials,

14. 7, 8, 9. I shall add a short remark of a Willow grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without earth. Upon the 13 of <hi>April</hi> 1662, I set a
top branch of the <hi>Peach-leaf'd Willow</hi> in a Glass-viol, among
12 ounces of pure Spring Water, with three small buds
upon the top thereof, scarce yet discernable. The first
ten or twelve dayes, little white specks appeared upon the
sides of the Willow, like small drops of <hi>Quick-silver,</hi> or
like the first Bubbles that arise upon the fermentation of
Ale or Wine, but no consumption of the Water all this
time. Indeed the <hi>Gemms,</hi> which stood three inches above
the Water, did visibly swell about the twelfth day. About
the fifteenth day, I perceived small white roots within the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:106992:149"/>
Water, upon several places of the <hi>Plant,</hi> and observed the
Liquor grow somewhat thick, and decay in bulk conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably.
Having perceived this, I took another Glass of the
same bigness, with that wherein the <hi>Willow</hi> grew, and
having filled both top-full with Spring Water, I obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
clearly the consumption of the Water wherein the
<hi>Plant</hi> stood, to be so great, that during <hi>May, Iune,</hi> and
a great part of <hi>Iuly,</hi> every week (at least) an ounce and
an half, or two ounces of it were insensibly spent: whereas
the other Water, standing by in an open Vessel of the same
size, made not waste of one spoonful in a whole moneth.
About the middle of <hi>August,</hi> the Water turned very thick,
and green, like that whereon <hi>Duck-weed</hi> useth to grow,
and the fair white roots were all obscured from the sight,
although the Vessel by the multitude of roots was not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the third part of Water it received at first. At
this time the branches were advanced to half the bigness,
and a much greater length, than the whole stock, at its
first planting; and the leaves of as fresh a verdure, as any
<hi>Willow</hi> in the fields. Thus, having observed, that a tree
of four ounces weight, could in three moneths time, and
little more, consume insensibly, seven or eight times its
own weight of pure Water, without the warm preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the earth, and by its own proper digestion, to thicken
the remnant of the Water, that it might serve for <hi>loricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of the tender fibres of the roots, I took the Glass, the
Tree, and all, and threw them over a Window, supposing
it needless to recruit the Water any more, and judging it
impossible without the warm guard of the earth, that the
naked Tree could be preserved in Winter: yet it had the
good fortune to fall among some thick Herbs in the corner
of a little Garden, where (after it had lien all Winter) it
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:106992:150"/>
was found, and brought back to me, the branches fairly
budding in <hi>April,</hi> the whole Tree fresh and green, yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little Water was left in the Glass, by reason, as I judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it had fallen upon its side. Then I endeavoured to
keep Water about it, but the Stock filling the neck of the
Viol, and the Roots the whole body thereof, the starved
<hi>Plant</hi> died in <hi>May,</hi> after it had lived a whole year without
earth. From this it would seem, that this kind of Tree,
(and it may be, many moe) doth dissipat insensibly six
times more Liquor, than it doth assimilar, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that a great quantity of moisture is necessary for
maintainance of great Woods. Neither is there any way
so advantagious for draining moist ground, where there are
no living Springs, as that of planting abundance of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which will best agree with that kind of soyl: for by
this means, what was formerly noisome, and superfluous,
is now converted partly into the useful aliment of the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and partly sent abroad in insensible exhalations,
which (according to the nature of the emitting <hi>Plants</hi>)
prove either very noisome, or wholsome to the Neighbour-Inhabitants.
Great care therefore would be had in the
choise of such Trees, as are to be planted in such moist
ground, as are near to mens dwellings, or places of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curse.
They are not fools, who prefer <hi>Firs,</hi> and <hi>Lime-trees</hi>
in their <hi>Avenues</hi> to <hi>Oak</hi> and <hi>Elme.</hi> Let the effects
of the <hi>Atomical</hi> exhalations of <hi>Alder</hi> and <hi>Oak</hi> upon fine
Linnen, and white Skins be more particularly noticed.</p>
               <p>Having spoken somewhat of the aliment and growth of
<hi>Plants,</hi> I shall in the next place give a short hint at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their aliment, especially of Trees. That the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
juice of <hi>Plants,</hi> is much thinner, than that of
<hi>Animals,</hi> no man, I suppose, will deny, seing <hi>that</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:106992:150"/>
thorow the trunck, or body of the <hi>Plants,</hi> by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible
pores; but <hi>this</hi> (for the most part) is sent
thorow all the members, through patent and manifest Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.
But how the nourishing, and vital juice in <hi>Plants</hi>
doth move, and by what passages, hath not yet been made
known, by any that I have seen. I made once a few Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations,
for trying of the motion of the aliment of Trees,
which bred in me this conjecture. The nutritive juice of
Trees is transmitted both to the roots and branches, through
the heart, or pitch, and woody pores of the Timber, and
when it is come to the extream parts, it returns again from
the tops of the roots and branches, between the bark and
timber, into these forenamed interior passages, and so back
to the extremities again, and that continually, so long as
the life remains. And because the substance of that skin,
or bark, which invests the fibres of the root, is more open
and porous, than that which is upon the outward branches:
therefore it seems, that so much as is superadded to the stock
of the former aliment, from the earth, is conveyed to the
heart and pitch, by means of, and together with, that part
of the retrograd juice, which returns from nourishing, and
enlivening the timber of the root-branches, (for it is an
easie Experiment, to make the top of any Tree become
root, by laying it down) and receives the impressions of
the life of the Tree, common to the whole mass of ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
juice, like the <hi>Chyll</hi> in <hi>Animals</hi> mixed with the
blood of the <hi>Veni-cave,</hi> before it come to the heart.</p>
               <p>This motion is not to be thought alwayes alike swift,
or of equal celerity: for the vital juice of the Tree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
so thick and oleagenous in the Winter, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof to the outward, is scarce discernable (though
the preparation of the <hi>Gemmes,</hi> both for leaves and flowers,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:106992:151"/>
are observed by the curious, and can be distinguished, even
in the coldest seasons) and the returns inward are in so
small quantities, that they are rather like vapours, than
liquid juice. Indeed, some Trees, when their root-bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are cut (even in Winter) will yeeld no small quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of an acid liquor, which by addition of the recent <hi>Lef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fas</hi>
from the earth, smells evidently of the Matrix, from
which it did proceed. Moreover, the passages especially
from the branches to the Trunk, are so straitned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
that the bark cleaveth to the Timber, as every
Wood-man knows. But so soon as the warm Spring hath
attenuated the ever-flowing juice in the whole Tree, then
doth it become turgid, and more aqueous over all: the
passages, and channels both in the trunk, and among the
tunicles, and particular skinnes, are so palpably filled with
this vital juice, that having no sufficient place to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in, it putteth forth new growths both in the
top, and in the root, which may be easily seen to have more
pitch than wood, and to be sealed on the extremity, with
the vestiges of a future Gemm; that by the former, they
may the more freely receive the vital influences from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and by the latter, may be secured from the depredation
of the external Air.</p>
               <p>To prove the motion <hi>ad extra,</hi> or to the extremities
of the branches; take the branch of any ordinary Tree,
about the bigness of a mans wrist; make it bare near the
body of the Tree of all bark, and subjacent tunicles (for
every Tree according to its kind, hath moe or fewer skins,
which serve for Veins, within the strong outmost Cortex)
at least for the breadth of a span, or two hand-breadth.
Then tye up the place, so excorticated with a <hi>compost,</hi> made
of horse-dung mixed with earth; let it stand so from <hi>May,</hi>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:106992:151"/>
till <hi>November.</hi> Then cut off the branch, a little above
the <hi>Compost,</hi> near the body of the Tree, and you shall
find it living and fresh, like the rest of the branches: yea,
small roots shall evidently appear to have come forth under
the <hi>Compost</hi> near the bark, but not under the bared place.
This branch in many kind of Trees being planted, will hold,
though not in all. I say then, seing the foresaid bough is
nourished from <hi>May</hi> till <hi>November,</hi> it is necessary, that it
receive nutriment from the body of the Tree, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
porosities thereof: for the bark being discontinued
by <hi>excortication,</hi> can send nothing upward towards the top
of the bough; and if it received nothing from the root, it
would wither in a few dayes. Yea, leave the discovered
part naked, but for a few dayes, and of necessity the branch
dieth, the aliment thereof being exhausted by the Air, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it can reach the extremities of the bough.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Vital Balsome</hi> of the Tree returns from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
by the internal bark, and inward superfice of the
external, together with the smooth outward part of the
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>unck, although the necessity of both timber and bark in
all <hi>Incisions,</hi> and <hi>Inoculations,</hi> might perswade the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and the visible course of the juice of the <hi>Sycamor</hi> in
<hi>February,</hi> and of the <hi>Birch</hi> in <hi>March,</hi> upon the cutting of
any small branch, might convince any curious beholder;
yet the <hi>knot</hi> or <hi>callus,</hi> that is made upon grafted Trees, will
better inform the ignorant: for this <hi>knot</hi> being alwayes
upon the shoulder, or root of the Graff, and never upon
the top of the Stock, doth evince clearly, that it is made
by <hi>restagnation,</hi> of the descending, and not of the ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
juice: otherwise, why doth it not swell the top of
the Stock, as well as the root of the Graff? Or why doth
it not extuberat in any other place of the Graff? These
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:106992:152"/>
are accidental <hi>varices,</hi> which can hardly be shunned in Imp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
seing the top of the Stock (except when it is very
young and succulent) doth not receive so kindly, as it
ought, the retrograd sap, although all that is sent out to
the Graff must ascend thorow the pores of the Stock.
Hence many times a considerable part of the Stock is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
because although abundance of aliment ascends to
the head or top thereof, yet no more of it goes to the
branches, but what is bestowed upon the Graff, a great
part of the rest being exhaled by the Air (especially in big
Stocks) and consequently, the place defrauded of its nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment:
no other wayes than when the motion of the
vital sap faileth, either in the whole, or in part, a total
decay or particular mortification of some part necessarily
follows, as in the Stemms of annual Plants, and mortified
tops of the <hi>Ectrapelous</hi> branches (that I may so call them)
of <hi>Willows, Plumbs,</hi> &amp;c. we may observe every <hi>Autumn.</hi>

               </opener>
               <p>
                  <q>I Was not a little surprised, at the receit of yours, when
I had considered your desire in it, being prest with two
difficulties, which seemed equally hard to evite. The
one, to give you my judgement in a matter wherein I
have been so little conversant my self, and have had the
steps of no other to follow, never one having hitherto
touched that subject in writting; I mean of <hi>Coals,</hi> and
other <hi>Minerals</hi> of that nature, their <hi>Course,</hi> and other
things relating thereunto; the observation whereof (I
grant) wants not its own pleasure, and usefulness. The
other, to refuse the desire of a friend, when importuned,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:106992:152"/>
to whom I owe my self, by many obligations. This last
having prevailed, hath determined me to assay the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
of the first. And though I am confident, what
account I can give you, shall give but very little satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:
yet I adventure to offer it, such as it is, very
freely in the following discourse, wherein you are not to
expect, that I will meddle with some questions, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anent,
which might be more curious, and pleasant, then
profitable, or satisfying, such as, if <hi>Coal,</hi> and <hi>Free-stone,</hi>
which keep one <hi>course,</hi> and have the same accidental
qualities, have been created in the beginning, in their
perfection, as wee now find them, and since that time
only preserved, as they were created for the use of men,
to whom all sublunary things were made subfervient?
Or, if they have been but produced gradually, as they
speak of <hi>Gold,</hi> and other <hi>Minerals,</hi> by the influence of
the <hi>Sun,</hi> in the bowels of the Earth? And if their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
be of that nature, out of what matter they are
formed? These things being above my reach, I shall leave
their inquiry, to those that are knowing in the secrets of
Nature, and shall therefore give you a narration, of
what either I have observed of these things, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr
in the <hi>Winning</hi> of <hi>Coal</hi> in my own experience, or by
conversing with others of more experience than my self,
in doing whereof, I shall follow this Method.</q>
               </p>
               <p>First, I shall speak of these things that are common to all
<hi>Coal,</hi> wherein they all agree, and which are, as it were, <hi>essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi>
to all, and of there differences, which are but acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and gradual sometimes, and yet are abundantly conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous,
and causeth different effects in the <hi>working;</hi> as their
<hi>Dipps</hi> and <hi>Rise,</hi> and <hi>Streek,</hi> for so are they termed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, of some things, which are but accidental to <hi>Coal,</hi>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:106992:153"/>
and yet so ordinary, that scarcely any is found without
them, in lesser or greater degrees; such are <hi>Gae's,</hi> and
<hi>Dykes,</hi> that alter the natural <hi>Course</hi> of the <hi>Metalls,</hi> very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
to every <hi>Coal,</hi> though in some less frequent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the nature and kind of the ground, where the
<hi>Coal</hi> is.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I shall speak something of <hi>Damps,</hi> and of their
different causes, and effects: of <hi>Wild-fire,</hi> and other such
like things, which are met with in the working of <hi>Coal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And lastly, of the best way for trying grounds to find
<hi>Coal,</hi> where never any hath been hitherto discovered: of
carrying on of <hi>Levels,</hi> for draining the water of <hi>Coal</hi> and
making it workable.</p>
               <p>It is to be cosidered, that all <hi>Free-stone,</hi> though of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
natures, hath the same <hi>course,</hi> with the <hi>Coal,</hi> that ly
either above them, or below them, except it be accident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
interrupted: therefore, whatsoever is spoken of the
one, is applicable to the other. And so we find in <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging</hi>
or <hi>Sinking,</hi> that after the <hi>Clay</hi> is past, which keeps no
<hi>course,</hi> all <hi>Metals,</hi> as <hi>Stone,</hi> and <hi>Tilles</hi> (which are <hi>Seems</hi> of
black Stone, and participat much of the nature of <hi>Coal</hi>) ly
one above another, and keep a regular <hi>Course;</hi> wherein the
three things most remarkable are their <hi>Dipp,</hi> and <hi>Rise,</hi> and
their <hi>Streek,</hi> as it is termed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dipp,</hi> and <hi>Rise,</hi> are nothing but a declining of the
whole body of the <hi>Metalls.</hi> And this general holds, that
all of them from their <hi>Center</hi> rises, till they be at the very
surface of the <hi>Earth;</hi> some only at a foot or two foot,
some at an ells distance from the surface, which is here
termed a <hi>Cropping:</hi> and whether <hi>Coal</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> the nearer
they come to the surface, the softer they become, till at
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:106992:153"/>
last they are converted, if it be a <hi>Stone,</hi> to a very <hi>Sand,</hi> and
if <hi>Coal,</hi> to a <hi>Dross,</hi> which will not burn.</p>
               <p>This d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>clining or <hi>Dipping,</hi> of the <hi>Coal,</hi> is sometimes
greater, and sensible, sometimes lesser, and almost insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
There being some, that if you consider the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
it will not be found one foot in ten; some one
foot in twenty, or one in thirty. Whereas in others it will
be one foot in three, or one in five. And sometimes it
hath its <hi>Course</hi> from the <hi>Center</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> almost in a
perpendicular to the surface, it cutting it, near to a <hi>right
Angle.</hi> The first sort, they term <hi>Flate-broad-coal,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the plainness, and evenness of its <hi>Course.</hi> The
next, they call <hi>Hinging-coal.</hi> The last is called <hi>Edge-Coal.</hi>
The first is the most profitable, in regard, that
it's long before the <hi>Coal-hewers</hi> can reach the <hi>Cropp,</hi> and
consequently the more of it is workable. The second and
third sort, are sometimes of their own nature, more firm,
and fitter for burning, but less of them can be reached in
working. The <hi>Course</hi> of all the three is most perceptible
in the three following Schematisms.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>In all the three Figures, the point B is the <hi>Cropp</hi> of the
<hi>Coal.</hi> The Line B C is the body of the <hi>Coal</hi> declining
or the <hi>Dipp</hi> from the <hi>Cropp.</hi> A C is the perpendicular,
falling from the Horizontal Line, whereby the true decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
or <hi>Dipp</hi> of the <hi>Coal</hi> is found. So that after you have
found your <hi>Coal</hi> at B, you must set down your <hi>Sink</hi> at the
point A. In the <hi>Flat-broad-Coal,</hi> which we suppose only
to decline, three fathoms in sixty; the <hi>Sink,</hi> that answers
to the perpendicular A C, will be of deepness three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms.
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:106992:154"/>
If the distance B A, be supposed to be 120 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms
alongst the <hi>Grass,</hi> or surface, then will the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the <hi>Sink</hi> be six fathom, and so forth. In the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
if the <hi>Coal</hi> be supposed to decline one fathom in
three, the <hi>Sink</hi> A C, being set down at the same distance
from the <hi>Cropp</hi> B, with the former, it will prove thirty fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom
deep. If the said distance be doubled, it becomes
sixty fathom deep, and so forth. In the third, keeping
that same distance alongst the surface, you shall not encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Coal</hi> with a Perpendicular <hi>Sink,</hi> because of its great
declination, and therefore through want of <hi>Air,</hi> and other
difficulties, you cannot dig so deep, as is necessary to that
effect, except the <hi>Sink</hi> should be made to decline, as doth
the <hi>Line</hi> A D. All these <hi>Dipps</hi> are to be seen in several
places of <hi>Lothian.</hi> The first is most conspicuous in the
Earl of <hi>Wintons</hi> ground at <hi>Tranent,</hi> where the <hi>Coal,</hi> and
other <hi>Metals</hi> are extraordinary flat and even. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is within the said Lordship of <hi>Tranent,</hi> in a piece of
ground, called <hi>Wester-Fauside.</hi> The third in <hi>Lonhead</hi> of
<hi>Laswaid,</hi> which pertains to Sir <hi>Iohn Nicolson</hi> of <hi>Nicolson:</hi>
and in many other places, one may see very different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
who is curious to observe them.</p>
               <p>From this general position of the <hi>Dipp,</hi> and <hi>Cropp</hi> of all
<hi>free Metals,</hi> there is one consequent, which is no uncouth
Observation, namely that these <hi>Metals</hi> rising from their
<hi>Dipp</hi> to a <hi>Cropp,</hi> every one of them riseth in their proper
course, if none of these things whereof we shall treat here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
interveen, and make an alteration, that is the <hi>Coal</hi> or
<hi>Stone,</hi> which is lowest, comes farrest out in its <hi>Cropping,</hi>
which is easily understood by the subsequent Schematism.</p>

               <p>Wherein the Line A M represents the surface of the
<hi>Earth.</hi> C D. E F. G H. I K. L M, are so many seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Metals,</hi> lying in <hi>course</hi> one above another. Suppose
C D were a <hi>Stone,</hi> and the <hi>Roof</hi> of the <hi>Coal</hi> E F (for so

G H, I K, were other two <hi>Stones,</hi> interveening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

it, must be found back, at the point D, and the <hi>Cropp</hi> of
the <hi>Coal</hi> under it, which is L M, must be found at M. And
this distance of <hi>Cropp</hi> is proportioned by the length of the
perpendicular between them, and the quantity of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.
For, the more even and flat a <hi>Coal</hi> is in its
<hi>course,</hi> and other <hi>Metals,</hi> above and below, the farder
doth the <hi>Cropp</hi> of the lowest <hi>Coal</hi> advance before the <hi>Cropp</hi>

in two several grounds, two <hi>Coals,</hi> between which,
there is an equal distance of perpendicular. And suppose
the <hi>Metals</hi> in the one ground to decline at 13 to 24, the
other at 13 to 16, then will the distance between the
<hi>Cropps</hi> in the two grounds be very considerable, as may be
represented by the two following Figures.</p>

and therefore the <hi>Base</hi> D F, which is <hi>subtended</hi> by the
greater <hi>Angle</hi> in the 5, must be greater then the <hi>Base</hi> D F,
which is <hi>subtended</hi> by the lesser <hi>Angle</hi> in the 6, which <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clide</hi>
proves in his 24 <hi>Proposition</hi> of his first Book, and is
demonstrat by <hi>Proclus</hi> in the <hi>Scholium</hi> to the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of the same Book.</p>
               <p>By this is made to appear the profitableness of a <hi>Flat-Coal,</hi>
beyond a <hi>Hinging-Coal,</hi> which was touched before,
in regard that having the <hi>Sinks</hi> of equal deepness in both,
there is much more of the <hi>Flater-Coal</hi> to be wrought, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it <hi>Cropp</hi> out, then of the <hi>Hinging,</hi> as there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the Lines D F in the first and second Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
or between the Lines I F, in the same.</p>

If it be enquired, if in rising grounds, where there is a
considerable ascent above ground, the <hi>Coal</hi> keeps a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in its <hi>Rising</hi> and <hi>Dipping</hi> with the ascent and descent of
the ground above? I answer, there is no certain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
proportion kept, whatever sometimes may happen.
For I have observed some <hi>Coals</hi> upon grounds of a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ascent, and their <hi>Dipp</hi> run quite contrary to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
of the Hill: and others have had a quite contrary
<hi>course</hi> to that, and have declined, or <hi>dipped</hi> with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of the ground above. But in the <hi>Streek</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I shall speak a little hereafter) there is more proportion
ordinarily to be remarked.</p>
               <p>There remains only one Question about the <hi>Dipps,</hi> and
<hi>Risings</hi> of <hi>Coals,</hi> which I shall a little consider, having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered
different judgements anent it, in conversing
with persons, who had experience in <hi>Coal,</hi> viz. whether
<hi>Coal</hi> and other Metals, after they have declined such a
length from their <hi>Cropp,</hi> suppose from <hi>West</hi> to <hi>East,</hi> take
another <hi>course,</hi> and rise to the same point, to which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
they dipped?</p>
               <figure>
                  <head>Figure 7.</head>
               </figure>
               <p>As if the <hi>Coal dipped</hi> from A, which is the <hi>Cropp,</hi> to B,
which should be the <hi>Center</hi> of that Body; and after that
rise to C? Or if it should continue its declination thorow
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:106992:156"/>
B to D, which is <hi>Antipodes</hi> to us? I shall not offer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
in a matter wherein there can be so little certainty
attained, but shall give my opinion, which is founded
upon the experience I have had, and Observations I have
had occasion to make on that Head. And first, I find in
all these <hi>Coals,</hi> wherein no contrary <hi>Cropp</hi> or <hi>Rising</hi> could
be visible, there are invincible obstructions; as either, they
have been near the <hi>Sea,</hi> and have <hi>dipped</hi> that way; and so
if they took any contrary <hi>course,</hi> the <hi>cropping</hi> behoved to
be in the <hi>deeps,</hi> and so no access to trace them. Or next,
they have <hi>dipped</hi> towards the foot of a Mountain, and so
the ground above rising the same way which they declined;
their <hi>course</hi> could not be pursued, till a contrary rising
should be discerned. Or thirdly, they have encountered
some <hi>Gae,</hi> or <hi>Dyke,</hi> which hath cut them off, before they
came to their full <hi>dipp,</hi> and thus their <hi>course</hi> was obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Now, those that have been acquainted with no other
<hi>Coals</hi> but such, I think it not strange, if it be hard to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them of those things they have not seen. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all those kinds, I have seen others, whose contrary
<hi>rising</hi> and <hi>dipping</hi> have either been visible to the eye, or
demonstrable by reason. For example, I have entered
under ground, as it were at the point C, at the very <hi>Grass-cropp,</hi>
and have gone following the <hi>dipp</hi> of that <hi>Coal</hi> to the
point B, at which the <hi>course</hi> hath altered, and carried me
out at the <hi>Grass</hi> at A, which are two contrary points of
the Compass. And that alteration of <hi>course</hi> was not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
by any <hi>Gae,</hi> or <hi>trouble,</hi> which sometimes have
that effect, the ground being very clean, and good <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi>
keeping their <hi>course</hi> most regularly.</p>
               <p>There are other instances for confirming my experience,
in fields, which are so large, that 'tis impossible to work
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:106992:157"/>
the <hi>Coal</hi> so far to the <hi>Dipp,</hi> it falling deep, and so wants <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi>
for conveying water from it, or wants Air, for following
it to such a deepness, as to overtake its <hi>Center,</hi> where it
takes a contrary <hi>course,</hi> and yet the contrary <hi>Cropp</hi> hath
been wrought in several places, which is evident to be a
part of the same body, with the other, both by the nature
of the <hi>Coal</hi> it self, by the <hi>Metals</hi> lying above it, and the
<hi>Coals</hi> below it, all which keeping the same <hi>Course,</hi> except
when they encounter <hi>troubles,</hi> which are incident to some
parcels of ground, more than to others. The greatest field
I know wherein this is conspicuous, is in <hi>Mid-lothian</hi>
where is to be found, the <hi>cropping</hi> of a <hi>Coal</hi> of a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
thickness, which is termed their <hi>great-seam,</hi> or <hi>Main-coal,</hi>
and the other <hi>Coals</hi> lying below it, which may be
traced in the order following. At <hi>Preston-Grange</hi> these
<hi>Coals</hi> are found <hi>dipping</hi> to the N W, and <hi>rising</hi> to the
S E, which have been wrought up to <hi>Wallifoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Lands of <hi>Inneresk,</hi> which marches therewith on the <hi>North.</hi>
From thence it runs through the ground of <hi>Carberry,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of these grounds from <hi>Preston-Grange,</hi> Giving <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell</hi>
to another. From thence, through a part of the Lands
of <hi>Smeaton,</hi> and next through a piece of ground belonging
to the Family of <hi>Buccleugh,</hi> called <hi>Coudon:</hi> and through
<hi>West-houses,</hi> which belongs to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Lothian,</hi> and at
<hi>Cockpen,</hi> and <hi>Stobhill,</hi> from thence runs through to <hi>Caring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Mill;</hi>
all which is a <hi>course,</hi> which in <hi>Streek</hi> lyes near
to S W, and N W, and will be in length about eight
miles. From thence, the <hi>course</hi> of the <hi>Coal</hi> turns, and is
found in the Barony of <hi>Carington, White-hill Ramsay, Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merton,</hi>
and from thence taking its <hi>Dipp,</hi> quite contrary
to what it had before, the other <hi>Dipping</hi> N and N W,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:106992:157"/>
or N E, according to the turn of the <hi>Streek,</hi> it <hi>Dipps</hi> there
S, S E, &amp;c. and from <hi>Gilmerton,</hi> it is found at <hi>Burntstone,</hi>
a piece of ground belonging to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Lauderdale:</hi> and
from thence at the <hi>Magdalen Pans,</hi> where the turn of the
<hi>cropp</hi> being within the Sea, is not seen, till it be found at
<hi>Preston-Grange,</hi> where we began to remark its <hi>course.</hi> The
parcel of ground, under which this great body of <hi>Coal</hi> lyes,
is of a considerable extent, it being eight miles in length,
and five or six in breadth; in regard whereof many other
<hi>Coals</hi> are found lying above the great <hi>Coal,</hi> the <hi>cropps</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
doth not come near the <hi>Cropp</hi> of it, by a considerable
distance.</p>
               <p>Though this instance alone, may sufficiently convince,
yet I shall not be unwilling to give another. The parcel
of ground, in which this <hi>Coal</hi> is found, is not of so great an
extent, as the other, and therefore its <hi>course</hi> may be the
more easily traced. For the greatest part, it belongs to the
<hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Winton,</hi> and lyes within the <hi>Lordship of Tranent,</hi>
whose contrary <hi>Cropps,</hi> are most conspicuous. This great
<hi>Coal,</hi> which is 10, or 12 foot thick (beginning at the head of
the Toun of <hi>Tranent</hi>) where it hath been wrought, runs
S W towards the march of the Lands of <hi>Elphingston,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the <hi>Lord Register,</hi> and continues in that same
<hi>course,</hi> till it come near to the <hi>house,</hi> and for the most part
<hi>dipping</hi> to the S E. And near the <hi>house,</hi> the <hi>Cropp</hi> is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
downward towards the march between <hi>Elphingston</hi> and
<hi>Ormiston,</hi> where the <hi>dipp</hi> is contrary to the former. And
from <hi>Elphingston-mains,</hi> it takes its <hi>course</hi> almost round,
through the Lands of <hi>Panston,</hi> and returns to the Toun of
<hi>Tranent</hi> where it began, which body of <hi>Coal</hi> will be in
length two miles, and in some places, as much in breadth.
Now, I leave it to the judgement of any person, if there be
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:106992:158"/>
not more reason to perswade, that this should be the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>course</hi> of these <hi>Minerals,</hi> where such pregnable instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to evince it, are found; then to conclude the contrary
from these <hi>Coals,</hi> the <hi>course</hi> whereof cannot be followed,
because of the invincible impediments, I mentioned before.
However, I leave every one to be determined, by his own
opinion, and shall be satisfied to injoy my own, till these of
more experience convince me of the contrary.</p>
               <p>There are some other things farder to be remarked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the <hi>Dipp,</hi> and <hi>Rise</hi> of <hi>Coals,</hi> which (possibly) every
one hath not seen, they being so very rare, and therefore
are not fit here to be passed without being considered. One
is, of a <hi>Coal,</hi> which having that contrary <hi>Dipp</hi> and <hi>Rise,</hi>
(whereof I have been speaking) in one of the <hi>cropps,</hi> hath
not come out to the <hi>Grass,</hi> and <hi>terminat;</hi> but after it hath
<hi>risen</hi> a considerable way in its contrary <hi>course,</hi> in stead of
<hi>Cropping</hi> out, hath taken a <hi>Dipp</hi> towards the same point,
to which it <hi>dipped</hi> first, and so having <hi>dipped</hi> to the <hi>Center</hi>
of its <hi>course,</hi> it hath <hi>risen</hi> again, and <hi>cropped</hi> to the contrary
point, as is to be seen in this eight Figure.</p>
               <figure>
                  <head>Figure 8.</head>
               </figure>
               <p>Where A B is the surface of the Earth. The point B
is the <hi>Cropp</hi> of a <hi>Coal dipping</hi> from N W, to the S E. From
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:106992:158"/>
C it takes its <hi>rise,</hi> and <hi>course</hi> to a contrary <hi>Cropp,</hi> towards
the point F, where the <hi>dead Cropp</hi> ought to be found. But
in stead of going that length, it takes another <hi>course</hi> from
the point E, <hi>dipping</hi> S E towards D, from which it takes its
<hi>rise,</hi> and continues it to the point A, where it <hi>terminats,</hi>
and where the <hi>dead Cropp</hi> is found. I grant, that it meets
with a <hi>trouble,</hi> or <hi>Gae,</hi> at the point E, which seems to be
the cause, why its natural <hi>course</hi> is changed. But its very
extraordinary to see such an effect. But of this afterwards,
in its own place.</p>
               <p>There is yet another thing to be remarked, in the <hi>dipps,</hi>
and <hi>risings</hi> of <hi>Coals,</hi> which is this. In the most part of
<hi>Coals,</hi> that have their <hi>course</hi> from <hi>dipp</hi> to <hi>cropp,</hi> without the
intervention of a <hi>dyke or gae,</hi> the declination is straight
down, from the horizontal line drawn from the point of the
<hi>cropp,</hi> to the fardest point of the <hi>dipp.</hi> That is, the <hi>Coal</hi>
declining from that point in a right line, makes with the
horizontal line, a <hi>right lined angle, angulus rectilineus,</hi>
though in some the <hi>angle</hi> is more <hi>acute,</hi> and in others less,
as is to be seen in the first, and second figures, where A B
being the horizontal Line, and B the <hi>cropp,</hi> B C is the
body of the <hi>Coal</hi> declining, which meeting with A B in the
point B, constitutes a <hi>right lined angle,</hi> and where A B C in
the second figure, is a greater <hi>angle,</hi> then A B C in the first.
Yet I have seen a <hi>Coal,</hi> the body whereof from the <hi>dipp,</hi> or
fardest point of declination, had its <hi>rise</hi> towards the <hi>cropp</hi>
very insensibly, it being <hi>Flatt,</hi> and then began to be more
sensible, till at last coming near to the surface of the Earth,
it takes in a sudden such a <hi>rise,</hi> that from declining one foot
of 12 or 14, it declines now one foot of three, as may be
made evident from this following Figure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:106992:159"/>
                  <figure>
                     <head>Figure 9.</head>
                  </figure>
               </p>
               <p>Where A B is the Line drawn from the extream points
of the <hi>Cropp,</hi> right horizontal. The body of the <hi>Coal
rising</hi> insensibly, is D C. But assoon as it comes to C, it
riseth with a great ascent till it <hi>Cropp</hi> out at A. Here you
see, that in stead of one side of a <hi>Triangle,</hi> which the <hi>course</hi>
of other <hi>Coals</hi> in their <hi>rising,</hi> or in their declination makes;
this <hi>Coal</hi> in <hi>rising</hi> makes two sides, namely D C, and C A,
the Figure D B C A being quadrilateral. The <hi>Coal</hi> of
this <hi>course</hi> was really wrought, and is yet visible in its <hi>waste,</hi>
where there is found no <hi>Gae</hi> or <hi>Dyke</hi> to make this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>These are the chief things that I have thought worthy
of Observation in the <hi>Dipps,</hi> and <hi>Risings</hi> of <hi>Coals,</hi> and
therefore I come now to touch a little the other part of
their <hi>course,</hi> which is commonly termed the <hi>Streek</hi> of a
<hi>Coal.</hi> To make intelligible to those, who are not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally
acquainted with <hi>Coal,</hi> this term, or what the
<hi>Streek</hi> is, we must lay this foundation, that the <hi>Coal</hi> is a
<hi>Physical Body,</hi> and so hath its three principal dimensions,
which do constitute it so, <hi>viz, Longitude, Latitude,</hi> and
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rofundity.</hi> 'Its <hi>Latitude,</hi> is that part contained between its
extream lines, which is measurable by its surface, to which
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:106992:159"/>
its <hi>dipping</hi> and <hi>rising,</hi> though alwayes incident, yet is but
accidental. Its <hi>Profundity</hi> is to be measured by the distance,
between the two surfaces, immediately next to it, above and
below: which are termed in <hi>Coallery</hi> its <hi>Roof</hi> and <hi>Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
because of the resemblance they have to the <hi>Roof,</hi>
and <hi>Pavement</hi> of a house. The <hi>Longitude</hi> is nothing else
but what is termed by the <hi>Coal-hewers,</hi> the <hi>Streek.</hi> For
if you imagine a Line drawn along the extream points of
the <hi>Rise,</hi> or <hi>Cropp</hi> of the <hi>Coal,</hi> that is properly the <hi>Streek</hi>
of the <hi>Coal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are but few things to be remarked, as to this
part of <hi>Coal:</hi> only first to find how it lyes, to what points
of the Compass it moves. For knowing whereof, there
is this general Rule, that, having found your <hi>Dipp</hi> and
<hi>Rise,</hi> to what ever Points that <hi>Course</hi> is directed, the
<hi>Streek</hi> is to the quite contrary. For supposing a <hi>Coal Dipp</hi>
S E, the two points, that respect the <hi>Dipp</hi> and <hi>Rise,</hi> must
be S E, and N W, being the points opposite one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Then it must needs follow, that the <hi>Streek</hi> must
run S W, and N E, which two <hi>courses</hi> divides the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
at <hi>right Angles.</hi> And therefore, where a <hi>Coal</hi> is
found to have contrary <hi>Dipps,</hi> and <hi>Risings,</hi> they declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sometimes to all the Points of the Compass (whereof
there hath been given two notable instances before) it must
needs follow, that there be also contrary <hi>Streeks,</hi> and so
the <hi>Streek</hi> of a Body of <hi>Coal</hi> is sometimes found to describe
a round figure, though not perfectly circular, and somtimes
a <hi>multangular</hi> figure. For it cannot be supposed that the
<hi>Streek</hi> makes alwayes a right Line, between the two points,
from which it is reckoned. For example, between the
<hi>Laird</hi> of <hi>Preston-grange</hi> his house at <hi>Preston-pans,</hi> and the
<hi>Stob-hill,</hi> there are the <hi>Streeks</hi> of several <hi>Coals,</hi> lying one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:106992:160"/>
another, which will be of length, about seven or eight
miles, lying near upon S W, and N E; yet the <hi>Cropps</hi> of
the said <hi>Coals</hi> (their <hi>dipp,</hi> and <hi>rise,</hi> being N W, and S E)
are sometimes farder advanced towards the S E, sometimes
farder back towards the N W, by the difference of a mile,
and this generally occasioned by the encounter of a <hi>Dyke</hi>
or <hi>Gae,</hi> whereof hereafter.</p>
               <p>The same question, that occurred in the <hi>Coals dipping</hi>
towards a Hill, or <hi>rising</hi> above ground, comes to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
into here; <hi>viz.</hi> If a <hi>Coal</hi> encountering an ascent,
or <hi>Brae</hi> above ground in its <hi>Streek,</hi> rises also with the
ground, and keeps its ascent? I answer, I have found it
so in all the <hi>Coals</hi> I have ever seen of that nature. <hi>GOD</hi> in
his providence, having so ordered it, that thereby it may
be the more useful, in regard more thereof may be wrought
by one <hi>Level</hi> or <hi>Aquaeduct,</hi> by which the Water is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away, as afterwards will be observed in speaking to <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels.</hi>
For confirmation whereof, I shall bring instances
both of <hi>Coals,</hi> that declines towards the Hill, and of others
that declines with the same <hi>dipp,</hi> the Hill hath it self. In
the <hi>Coals</hi> of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nhard, Grange, Kinglassy,</hi> and <hi>Kinneil,</hi>
which keep all one general <hi>course,</hi> the ascent above ground
is from the Sea, (which lyes North) towards the South,
or thereabout; the <hi>Coal dipps</hi> or declines towards the
N W, and so consequently <hi>rises</hi> to the S E. The <hi>Streek</hi>
of these <hi>Coals,</hi> is from the N E to S W, which slops alongs
the Hill, and comes up to the top thereof to the West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of the House of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nhard.</hi> Now, in sinking in that
ground, if an equal proportion be kept, in all the <hi>Sinks</hi>
from the <hi>Cropp,</hi> and a just allowance given for the different
<hi>Rising</hi> above ground, the <hi>Sinks</hi> will be near of an equal
deepness along all the <hi>Streek.</hi> So that a <hi>Sink</hi> upon the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:106992:160"/>
same <hi>Coal</hi> near to the Sea, which is the N E point of the
<hi>Streek,</hi> at equal distance from the <hi>Cropp,</hi> will be as deep as
a <hi>Sink</hi> upon the top of the Hill, being the S W point of
the <hi>Streek</hi> at the same distance from the <hi>Cropp,</hi> allowing
alwayes the different <hi>rise</hi> above ground, and excepting
some particular <hi>troubles</hi> falling in upon the Metals of one
<hi>Sink,</hi> and not of another, and so making them <hi>dipp</hi> more,
which will occasion a difference of the deepness. The same
is also found in the <hi>Coals</hi> of <hi>Dysart,</hi> and <hi>Weems.</hi> As also
in that great body of <hi>Coal</hi> before mentioned, between
<hi>Preston-grange</hi> and <hi>Stobhill,</hi> the declination whereof is to
the N E, which is also the <hi>course</hi> of the descent above
ground.</p>
               <p>Another instance is from the <hi>Coals</hi> within the Lordship
of <hi>Tranent,</hi> the <hi>dipp</hi> whereof is of another <hi>course,</hi> being
contrary to the descent of the Hill, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Coal dipping</hi>
to the S E, and consequently the <hi>Streek</hi> running S W,
and N E, where the same is to be observed that was seen
in the other, anent the equality of the deepness of <hi>Sinks</hi>
along the <hi>Streek,</hi> with the same allowances, and exceptions
before mentioned.</p>
               <p>Some have been of opinion that <hi>Streeks</hi> of <hi>Coals</hi> ly ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
South and North, or to some of the points near to
these two Cardinal ones, between South and S W, and
North and N E, as South and by West, and North and
by East, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which general I cannot agree, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of what I have before made evidently appear, <hi>viz.</hi>
that some <hi>Coals</hi> have their <hi>croppings</hi> towards all the points
of the Compass, and the <hi>Streeks</hi> being regulated by the
<hi>Cropps,</hi> they must necessarily be judged to have their <hi>courses</hi>
proportioned to theirs: so that if a <hi>Coal dipp</hi> to the true
North, and <hi>rise</hi> to the <hi>South,</hi> the <hi>Streek</hi> must be East, and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:106992:161"/>
West. However, I acknowledge two things, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
that opinion.</p>
               <p>First, that of all the <hi>Coals</hi> I ever have seen, where these
contrary <hi>dipps</hi> and <hi>risings,</hi> could not be traced, and made
visible, the <hi>Sreek</hi> hath inclined to those points of South and
North. But I must also confess, that they are but few I
have seen, in respect of what I have not seen, and so if any
others experience, who have seen more, contradict mine, I
shall willingly yeeld, and not be tenacious.</p>
               <p>Next, in these <hi>Coals,</hi> which I instanced, that have their
<hi>Cropp</hi> to all the Points, and consequently their <hi>Streeks,</hi> and
in others of the same nature, which I have seen, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced,
I found that part of the <hi>Streek,</hi> which lyes towards
these <hi>Cardinal points,</hi> to be the greatest, being double, or
triple to the other <hi>Sreeks</hi> in length. So that when the
<hi>Streek,</hi> that lyes either along the one <hi>Cropp,</hi> or the other,
towards the S W, and N E, will be seven miles in length,
that lying S E, and N W, will be but four, and sometimes
less. And this is all the account I can give, of that part of
<hi>Coal,</hi> called the <hi>Streek.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second thing I promised to speak of, was of some
things, which are but accidental to <hi>Coals,</hi> and yet so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
that hardly are any found without them in lesser,
or greater degree, such are <hi>Gae's,</hi> and <hi>Dykes,</hi> which alters
their natural <hi>course,</hi> and they being the occasion of so much
<hi>Trouble,</hi> in the working of <hi>Coal,</hi> and following its <hi>course,</hi>
the <hi>Coal-hewers</hi> call them ordinarily by<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>that name <hi>Trouble.</hi>
This <hi>Trouble</hi> or <hi>Gae</hi> then, is a Body of <hi>Metal</hi>-falling in upon
the <hi>course</hi> of the <hi>Coal,</hi> or <hi>Free-stone,</hi> obstructing, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
their kindly and natural <hi>course,</hi> keeping no regular
<hi>course</hi> it self, and being of nature alwayes different from the
Metal, whose <hi>course</hi> it interrupts. And these <hi>Gae's</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:106992:161"/>
also among themselves, in their nature, and in their
<hi>course</hi> they keep: or more properly in the way wherein
they encounter other <hi>Metalls,</hi> and in their effects. In
their nature, for some of them con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ists of an impregnable
<hi>Whin-Rock,</hi> or <hi>Flinty-Stone,</hi> thorow which it is almost
impossible to work: and if there be a necessity to cut them
thorow, it is done at a vast expence, and takes a long time,
and must be cut open to the surface of the earth, it being
impossible to Mine it under ground. Some of them are
again of <hi>Stone,</hi> like a <hi>Free-stone,</hi> but seems rather an abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of nature, they having no rule in their <hi>course,</hi> by which
a man can follow them, nor can their stone be useful.</p>
               <p>In their encountering of <hi>Coals,</hi> or <hi>Free-stone,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they encounter them in the <hi>Dip,</hi> and sometimes in
the <hi>Streek,</hi> and sometimes between the two. These that
are met with in following the <hi>Dipp</hi> of the Coal, ly along
the <hi>Streek</hi> thereof. For example, if the <hi>Coal Dipp</hi> S E,
the <hi>Gae</hi> lies N E, and S W. These that are encountered
in the <hi>Streek,</hi> lyes to the <hi>Dipp</hi> and <hi>Rise:</hi> so the <hi>Coal Streek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
N E, and S W, the <hi>Gae</hi> is found to ly S E, and N W.
Others of them, lyes between <hi>Streek</hi> and <hi>Dipp,</hi> that is to
some point between the two: as the <hi>Streek</hi> being S W,
and N E, and the <hi>Dipp</hi> and <hi>Rise</hi> S E, and N W, there
may be a <hi>Gae</hi> found lying W S W, and E N E. Now,
when I speak of a <hi>Gae's</hi> lying to such Points of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
this doth not contradict what was said before, that
they had no regular <hi>course</hi> themselves. My meaning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that though they have a certain length, lying between
two points, and a thickness between two <hi>Metalls,</hi> yet by
the <hi>Metal</hi> of the <hi>Gae</hi> it self, it is impossible to know its
<hi>course,</hi> as it is in other <hi>Metalls</hi> of <hi>Coal</hi> or <hi>Free-stone,</hi> whose
<hi>courses</hi> are discernable at the first view.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:106992:162"/>
Their effects are different, as their nature and <hi>course</hi>
are different: only they agree in these two generals. First,
that all of them renders that part of the <hi>Coal,</hi> that comes
nearest to them, unprofitable and useless, though some less,
and some more, they being unfit for burning. And it is
remarked, that these <hi>Gaes</hi> that consists of <hi>Whin-rock,</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the <hi>Coal</hi> next to it, as if it were already burnt, being
so dried, that it moulders in handling it. In others, the
<hi>Coal</hi> is not altogether so ill, and yet its nature is altered,
from what it is at a distance from the <hi>Gae.</hi> The next ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
is, that all of them alters the natural <hi>course</hi> of the
<hi>Coal</hi> in less or more, some of them making it <hi>Dipp</hi> much
more then its ordinary <hi>course,</hi> which they call <hi>Down-gaes:</hi>
Some again making their <hi>rise</hi> much more than their <hi>course,</hi>
which they call <hi>Up-gaes.</hi> Others making an alteration as
to the <hi>Streek,</hi> causing it go out beyond its ordinary bounds,
as we observed before in that great <hi>Streek</hi> of <hi>Coal</hi> between
<hi>Preston-Grange</hi> and <hi>Stobhill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is to be considered, that when in working of a
<hi>Coal,</hi> whether to the <hi>Dipp,</hi> or <hi>Rise,</hi> or <hi>Streek,</hi> one of these
<hi>Gaes</hi> is encountered with, the <hi>Coal</hi> is quite cut off, and as
it were <hi>terminat:</hi> so that you see nothing where the <hi>Coal</hi>
should be, but either a <hi>Stone,</hi> or <hi>Clay,</hi> or rotten <hi>Till,</hi> or
some such thing. And the practique of <hi>Coallery</hi> is to trace
the <hi>course</hi> of the <hi>Coal</hi> through that, till you overtake it in
the other side. And before any thing be said to that part,
you must notice, that some <hi>Gaes</hi> are of greater force than
others, and their influence upon the <hi>course</hi> of other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls
greater, whence you shall see a threefold effect. One
is, that by some great <hi>Gaes,</hi> which a <hi>Coal</hi> meets with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
is quite cut off, so that in the other side thereof, there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
not a vestige of that <hi>Coal,</hi> or of any other Metal that wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:106992:162"/>
above it, or below it, to be seen. And if there be any
other <hi>Coal,</hi> as sometimes there are, they are quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from them of the other side. I said by <hi>some,</hi> because
there is one instance to the contrary, which is somewhat
singular. In the Earl of <hi>Winton</hi>'s ground at <hi>Cockeny,</hi> there
is found a <hi>course</hi> of <hi>Coals</hi> and <hi>Free-stone, dipping</hi> to the
S E in the <hi>Links;</hi> and upon the <hi>full-sea-mark,</hi> there is a
<hi>tract</hi> or <hi>course</hi> of <hi>Whin-rocks</hi> lying E and W, underneath
which these <hi>Coals</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> comes thorow without alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of <hi>course,</hi> and are found I within the <hi>Sea-mark,</hi> with
the same <hi>Dipp</hi> and <hi>Rise</hi> upon the North side, they had
upon the South side of the said <hi>Rocks:</hi> and yet the <hi>Coal</hi> is
encountered upon the South hand by a <hi>Gae</hi> under ground,
through which it passeth, not without a considerable alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>The greatest of these <hi>Gaes,</hi> that I know, is that which
takes its beginning, that we see on Land, at the <hi>Harbour</hi>
of the <hi>Pans,</hi> called <hi>Achisons-Haven,</hi> which hath been cut
by <hi>Preston-Grange,</hi> for <hi>Level</hi> to his <hi>Coal,</hi> and goes from
that to <hi>Seton,</hi> which may be traced above ground, almost
the whole way; and hath been cut at <hi>Seton;</hi> for serving
the <hi>Level</hi> of that <hi>Coal</hi> now wrought at <hi>Tranent.</hi> From
thence it passeth through the fields of <hi>Long-Niddry,</hi> a place
pertaining to the Earl of <hi>Winton,</hi> and through the <hi>Coats,</hi>
which pertains to the Earl of <hi>Hadington,</hi> till it joyn with
<hi>Pancreck-hills,</hi> a tract of Rocky Mountains, from whence
it is traceable to <hi>Linton-bridges,</hi> where it is visible in the
Water, the Water of <hi>Tyn</hi> falling over it, and making a
<hi>Lin,</hi> which they call <hi>Linton-Lin;</hi> from thence to the
<hi>East-sea.</hi> And it is known by Sea-men, that it keeps a
<hi>course</hi> thorow the <hi>Firth</hi> from <hi>Achisons-haven,</hi> (whence
we reckoned its beginning upon Land) towards the West
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:106992:163"/>
and N W, it being found to the Southward of <hi>Inch-keith,</hi>
and before <hi>Leith,</hi> where stands a <hi>Beacon,</hi> and so can be
traced to the North Shore.</p>
               <p>The second effect of <hi>Gaes,</hi> is to cut off the <hi>Coal</hi> quite,
as to a part of the field, so that in the other side, having
pierced the <hi>Gae,</hi> you shall not find the <hi>Coal,</hi> and possibly
not within a quarter of a mile of the <hi>Gae,</hi> which cuts it off,
and at that place shall only find the <hi>Cropp</hi> and the Body
<hi>Dipping,</hi> as it did before it was cut off; and if you shall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
between that side of the <hi>Gae,</hi> where you lost your <hi>Coal</hi>
(I suppose the <hi>Coal</hi> then being 24 fathom from the <hi>Grass</hi>)
to the place where the <hi>Coal</hi> in the other side of the <hi>Gae</hi>
shall be found at the same deepness, it will be near 500
paces. For making this more intelligible, let us suppose
a <hi>Coal Dipping</hi> S E, and in working to the <hi>Dipp,</hi> there is
a <hi>Gae</hi> encountered with (This was really done in a piece
of ground I know, and so it is no meer supposition) at which
<hi>Gae</hi> the <hi>Coal</hi> is cut off; for finding whereof the <hi>Gae</hi> is pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and nothing found in the other side, <hi>viz.</hi> in the
S E side of the <hi>Gae,</hi> but at more than 100 paees distant,
the <hi>Crop</hi> of a <hi>Coal,</hi> which lyes under the <hi>Coal,</hi> that was
lost, was found, after which it was easie to find the other.
Now, that it was the same <hi>Coal,</hi> that was lost, upon the
North side of the <hi>Gae,</hi> is not only evident, by the kind of
<hi>Coal,</hi> and all the <hi>Metals</hi> above, and below keeping the
same <hi>course,</hi> but by this, that the <hi>Gae</hi> wearing out towards
the West, the two parts of the <hi>Coal</hi> that was separated by
it, joynes themselves again, and continues in one body,
as they were before separation.</p>
               <p>The last effect of the <hi>Gae</hi> is, that it doth not quite cut
off the <hi>Coal</hi> from the other side of it, but makes an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the <hi>course,</hi> either in the <hi>Dipp,</hi> or in the <hi>Rise,</hi> or
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:106992:163"/>
                  <hi>Streek,</hi> as was before noted: so that in meeting with one
of these <hi>Gaes,</hi> having considered its nature, and pierced it,
the Coal will be found in the other side, immediatly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Gae,</hi> but with an alteration of <hi>course.</hi> Now, in
these two last effects, since the <hi>Coal</hi> is not totally cut off,
it will be worth the inquiry, to find the surest way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the <hi>Coal</hi> after it is lost. Therefore, where the
<hi>Coal</hi> is not cut off, by a considerable distance, and having
pierced the <hi>Gae,</hi> it is not to be found in the other side,
you are to consider well the nature of the <hi>Metals</hi> you find
approach to the <hi>Gae,</hi> and if they be such, whether <hi>Stone,</hi> or
<hi>Coal,</hi> as you know to ly under the <hi>Coal</hi> that you have lost,
then you may be sure the <hi>Coal</hi> is to be found above in its
<hi>course,</hi> which is to be traced by the <hi>Dipp</hi> of the <hi>Metals</hi>
you find. As sometimes I have seen, when a <hi>Coal</hi> hath
been cut off by a <hi>Gae,</hi> happly there is another <hi>Coal</hi> under
it 12 fathom, after the <hi>Gae</hi> hath been pierced, and the lost
<hi>Coal</hi> not coming near to it in the other side, that hath been
found there, by which it was certainly concluded, that the
uppermost <hi>Coal</hi> behoved to be there also, though a little
back, conform to its <hi>course.</hi> But, if the <hi>Metals</hi> or <hi>Coals,</hi>
under the lost <hi>Coal,</hi> hath not been known, then you are
to take notice of the <hi>Dipp</hi> and <hi>Rise</hi> of these <hi>Metals,</hi> you
find on the other side of the <hi>Gae,</hi> which you have pierced,
and making that your rule, <hi>range back over the Metals,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the direction to be given afterwards, and you shall
find the <hi>Cropp</hi> of the <hi>Coal</hi> you want, and after which you
were inquiring.</p>
               <p>Where the <hi>Coal</hi> is not quite cut off by the <hi>Gae,</hi> but hath
its <hi>course</hi> only altered, you are to consider, in searching for
it, before you pierce your <hi>Gae,</hi> that which the <hi>Coal-hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
term the <hi>Vise,</hi> or some of them the <hi>Weyse</hi> of the <hi>Gae,</hi>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:106992:164"/>
which in effect is nothing else, but a dark vestige of the
<hi>Dipp</hi> or <hi>Rise,</hi> that the body which now constitutes the
<hi>Gae,</hi> should have had naturally, if it had been perfected;
which when it tends downward, then must the <hi>Gae</hi> be put
over that way, and in the other side shall the <hi>Coal</hi> be found,
and <hi>Down,</hi> as they term it; that is, the <hi>Dipp</hi> which it had
naturally, augmented. And, if the <hi>Vise</hi> be <hi>Up,</hi> the same
way must be taken for piercing the <hi>Gae,</hi> and the <hi>Coal</hi> will
be found <hi>Up,</hi> that is, its <hi>Rise</hi> augmented. But these things
cannot be made so intelligible, as by seeing, there being
many things in the alteration of the <hi>course</hi> of Metals very
curious, and worthy of Observation: as when a <hi>Coal</hi> is
cast down out of its natural <hi>course</hi> by a <hi>Gae,</hi> and so made
sometimes <hi>under-Level,</hi> it riseth as much to another hand,
and the <hi>Cropps</hi> go so much farder out, which still makes the
<hi>Level</hi> useful, the use whereof would have been judged lost
by the <hi>down-casting.</hi> Sometimes a <hi>Coal</hi> made to have four
contrary <hi>courses,</hi> as is evident from the eighth Figure,
where there being a <hi>Gae</hi> at E, makes it take such another
<hi>course,</hi> in stead of coming out to the <hi>grass.</hi> Sometimes,
before the Metals overtake the <hi>Gae,</hi> they are made to ly
like a <hi>Bowe;</hi> one instance whereof is visible above ground
in some Metals lying between <hi>Bruntiland</hi> and <hi>Kinghorn,</hi> at
a place called the <hi>Miln-stone,</hi> where there is a small <hi>Coal</hi>
with <hi>Free-stone</hi> above it, all <hi>Dipping</hi> to the S E, and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
to the N W. Upon the <hi>Rise</hi> they meet with a <hi>gae,</hi>
which is a great <hi>Whin-rock.</hi> In their <hi>course</hi> to the <hi>grass,</hi>
before they touch the said <hi>Rock,</hi> they take a contrary
<hi>course,</hi> and <hi>dipps</hi> into it, and are there quite cut off. The
manner whereof is to be seen in this tenth Figure follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>

Now, whereas they should have risen towards A,
they turn at D, and <hi>dipps</hi> into the <hi>Rock,</hi> which any may
observe in passing that way. Many other such motions
are observable, which I pass, and leaves them to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the curious.</p>
               <p>The third thing I promised to speak of, was of <hi>Damps,</hi>
and as they are termed by the <hi>Coal-hewers, Ill Air.</hi> These
do deserve a more accurat inquiry into their <hi>kinds,</hi> their
<hi>causes,</hi> and <hi>effects;</hi> then I am capable to make, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many things in them very considerable, and worthy of
a narrow search: therefore following the course I have
hitherto observed, I shall shew my own Observations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and leave the more curious search to the spirits fitted for
that purpose.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Damp</hi> then makes an obstruction of respiration in
Men, or other living Creatures, in Subterraneous spaces,
as <hi>Caves, Coal-rooms, Levels, Sinks,</hi> and such like;
which obstruction proceeds principally from two causes,
both which goes under the name of <hi>Ill Air,</hi> among the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.
The first is the corruption, or putrefaction of the
Air, whereof there are two sorts; one is in places where
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:106992:165"/>
hath been <hi>fire</hi> kindled, which burns the <hi>Coal</hi> under ground,
the smoke whereof, being full of Sulphur, and other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuminous
matter, and not having free passage to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
ground, filleth all the <hi>waste Rooms</hi> under ground, and
infects the Air so, that the smell of it, even at a distance,
is intolerable, and amongst it no living Creature is able to
breath. Of this there are examples in <hi>Dysert</hi> in <hi>Fife,</hi> and
<hi>Fauside</hi> in <hi>East<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>Lothian.</hi> This was kindled on design by a
Fellow, who for his pains was hanged in the place, and
hath burnt these 50 years, and more, the <hi>fire</hi> whereof is
sometimes seen near the <hi>grass,</hi> with abundance of smoke,
as it runs from one place to another. The second, where
the Air is corrupted without the mixture of smoke, or any
other gross corrupting body, which is the most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of all <hi>Damps,</hi> and hath the strangest effects, in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>Animals</hi> in an instant, and so hath been alwayes most
prejudicial in the works, where it is found, many persons
having thereby lost their lives, without access to cry but
once <hi>Gods mercy,</hi> to some instances whereof I have been
witness. I shall not offer to determine about the cause of
this <hi>Damp,</hi> but shall give an account of somethings I have
observed about it, which when duely pondered, may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lay a foundation, at least of a probable conjecture,
whence it may proceed.</p>
               <p>This kind of <hi>Damp</hi> then, and <hi>Ill Air,</hi> is never found in
<hi>Coal,</hi> or other <hi>Metals,</hi> where there is Water to be found;
I mean, whence the Water hath not been drawn away by
a <hi>Level,</hi> or <hi>Aquae-duct:</hi> as in <hi>Coals,</hi> where there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to <hi>lave</hi> the Water from place to place, or to pump
it along the ascent or rise of the <hi>Coal,</hi> to the bottom of the
<hi>Sink,</hi> from which it is drawn out above ground, this <hi>Ill

these <hi>Coals</hi> where the Water is drawn from the <hi>Coal</hi> by
a <hi>Level,</hi> or <hi>Aquae-duct</hi> under ground, till it come of its own

out of which it is forced also above ground, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
only from the other, that the Water runs here of
its own accord by a descent to the <hi>Sink,</hi> which is termed a
<hi>drawing Sink:</hi> in the other it must be forced by the <hi>Rise</hi> of
the <hi>Coal,</hi> because happly, a <hi>Sink</hi> upon the <hi>Dipp</hi> would be
of such a <hi>deepness,</hi> that no force could draw it up in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular.</p>
               <p>But this kind of <hi>Damp</hi> is found ordinarily in these <hi>Coals</hi>
from which the Water is drawn by a <hi>Level,</hi> the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

which it is to dry: so that the Water which comes from
the <hi>Coal,</hi> runs without being forced, and is sometimes so
considerable, that it makes <hi>Mills</hi> go, without any other
addition, as is to be seen in the Earl of <hi>Wintons</hi> Lands of
<hi>Seton,</hi> where four <hi>Mills</hi> goes with the Water that comes
from under ground, out of the <hi>Coal;</hi> which kind of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels</hi>
are only found where the <hi>Coal</hi> lyes in a Field, which
hath a considerable <hi>Rise,</hi> or ascent above ground; there
being a necessity to make use of the other two wayes spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, for drying the <hi>Coal,</hi> when the Field in which it
lyes is a Plain.</p>
               <p>Further, of these <hi>Coals,</hi> which are dryed by the <hi>Free-level</hi>
(for so they term the <hi>Level</hi> that runs unforced)
there are some to which this kind of <hi>Damp</hi> is more incident,
than to others. The cause of which difference is found to
be, the solidity and clossness of the <hi>Metals,</hi> whether of
<hi>Coal</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> wherein some exceeds another. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some, that are full of <hi>rifts,</hi> or empty spaces (I mean
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:106992:166"/>
empty of any part of the same body where they are) which
will sometimes serve, to convey a considerable quantity of
Water in place of an <hi>aquae-duct</hi> or <hi>level;</hi> which <hi>spaces</hi> are
termed by the vulgar, <hi>Cutters,</hi> which sometime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> proves
very profitable in the ground where they are found, both
in regard of the use they serve for, in stead of <hi>Level,</hi> and for
rendring the <hi>Metals</hi> wherein they are found, more easie to
work, in making them yeeld easily to the force of the
<hi>wedge</hi> and <hi>leaver.</hi> Other Metals there are, wherein few
of these <hi>Cutters</hi> are to be found, and if water be to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
through them, there is a necessity of cutting a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
through them for that effect. Now, this <hi>Damp,</hi>
whereof we speak is found most frequently, and most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in the first sort of <hi>Metals, viz.</hi> in these which are
full of <hi>Cutters</hi> or <hi>Rifts,</hi> which gives some ground to this
conjecture of its cause. These <hi>Spaces</hi> which are found in
<hi>Coal,</hi> or other <hi>Metals,</hi> as <hi>Stone</hi> or <hi>Till,</hi> before the <hi>Coal</hi>
begin to be dryed by a <hi>Level,</hi> are full of water, which is
still in motion, as are all <hi>subterraneous springs,</hi> whereof
some are more violent, some more slow, conform to the
passage they have to the fountains above ground, where
they discharge themselves. Now, for drying these <hi>Coals,</hi>
and rendring them workable, there is a necessity to cut a
passage, thorow which that water discharges it self quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it being large, and admitting a great quantity at once,
by vertue whereof; a great field is drained at once, and
the <hi>Sourse</hi> not being able to furnish so much water, as the
<hi>Conduit</hi> is able to convey, these <hi>Spaces</hi> in the body of the
<hi>Metals,</hi> being emptied of Water, must needs be filled with
<hi>Air,</hi> which <hi>Air</hi> having little <hi>contact</hi> and <hi>commerce,</hi> with
the great body of <hi>Air</hi> above ground, and so hath little or
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o motion, corrupts in these places, and thereby becomes
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:106992:166"/>
                  <hi>poisonable,</hi> so that when any <hi>Animal</hi> is necessitat to draw
it, and <hi>respire</hi> by it, it choaks them on a sudden, just as
standing Water, which being without motion corrupts,
and becomes poisonable, though haply not in so great a
degree as the <hi>Air:</hi> the <hi>Air,</hi> being a body much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iner and
purer, than Water, that holding good in it, <hi>corruptio
optimi pessima.</hi> This is much confirmed by what is before
asserted, that in the <hi>Coals,</hi> whence the Water is drawn, and
they drained, but not by <hi>free-course,</hi> but by <hi>Force,</hi> as
<hi>Pumping,</hi> and drawing by <hi>buckets,</hi> these <hi>Damps</hi> are seldom
or never found: because the passage of the Water being
forced, it does not so suddenly dry the <hi>Metals,</hi> as the other,
whereby there is alwayes left in these <hi>Spaces</hi> some Water,
which being it self in motion, keeps the <hi>Air</hi> also in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with it, and thereby the <hi>Air</hi> is kept from <hi>corruption,</hi>
at least in such a degree, as it is in the other. Hence we
find, that in these kinds of <hi>Coals,</hi> the <hi>Rooms</hi> under-ground
are alwayes wet, or for the most part they are so: whereas
in the other, there will be no Water found to wash a mans
hands: and sometimes the <hi>Coal</hi> through want of Water,
becomes so dry, that it cannot be wrought in great pieces,
as others, but crushes in the very working, and when
wrought, is rendered useless, and will not at all burn.
This puts me in mind of a very pleasant conception of a
worthy and learned Person, Doctor <hi>George Hepburn</hi> of
<hi>Monk-ridge,</hi> with whom I had occasion one day to discourse
on this Subject. He is of opinion that the <hi>Water</hi> is the
<hi>Mother</hi> of the <hi>Coal,</hi> whereby it is preserved fresh, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted,
and that when the <hi>Water</hi> is drawn off, and this
<hi>Damp</hi> follows, it is not the <hi>Air,</hi> which succeeds in place
of the <hi>Water,</hi> and is corrupted for want of motion, that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
it. But as we see, when the corruption of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:106992:167"/>
within a Vessel, when the <hi>Mother</hi> is gone, corrupts
the Vessel it self, and occasions an ill savour or taste in the
Vessel; so that the <hi>Coal</hi> being corrupted by the want of
its <hi>Mother,</hi> the <hi>Water;</hi> corrupts the Air in the subterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Spaces,</hi> as in <hi>Coal-Mines, Sinks, Caves,</hi> and other such
like. He had likewise another pleasant conception about
the <hi>generation of Coal,</hi> judging it to be formed gradually
out of another Metal, as of <hi>Till,</hi> by the help of <hi>Water,</hi> of
which he himself may perhaps give an account<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And though
I be not of his opinion in that matter, yet I must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
I was taken with it, and shall be glad to see a more
full account of it from him, than he had access to do in the
short conference we had.</p>
               <p>The effects of this <hi>Damp</hi> are first, it hinders the burning
of all combustible matter, as <hi>Candle, Coal, Pitch, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi>
&amp;c. so that if you take a <hi>Torch</hi> lighted, and let it
down to a <hi>Sink,</hi> where the <hi>Ill Air</hi> is prevalent in the time,
it shall straightway extinguish it. Or take a <hi>Coal,</hi> which is
burning, and let it down, it shall not only extinguish the
<hi>Flame,</hi> but shall make the <hi>Coal</hi> in an instant <hi>dead,</hi> and as
cold as never heat had been in it. But the most dangerous
effect is, its killing of <hi>living Creatures,</hi> whereby many
persons have been suddenly killed. Some in going down
to a <hi>Sink,</hi> where it hath been powerful, have fallen out of
the <hi>Rope,</hi> and perished. Others have been choaked, and
yet have gotten out by the help of others in a sudden, and
have remained a considerable time without the least ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of life, but yet have at last recovered. Yet it
hath been observed, that some of these persons that have
been so struck with the <hi>Damp,</hi> and recovered, have had
alwayes some <hi>lightness of Brain</hi> thereafter, and never so
settled as formerly. This I know to have happened to one,
whom I have seen so, many times thereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:106992:167"/>
What hath been its effects on some <hi>Animals,</hi> whereof
you have made Experiment, I leave to the account you
have given. One thing I shall only mention, which to me
seems somewhat strange, that notwithstanding these <hi>Damps</hi>
are so effectual, and causeth so suddenly the death of <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi>
yet the <hi>Ratts,</hi> which are in some of these places,
where the <hi>Damps</hi> are most violent, are not reached by
them. For sometimes, when they are so powerful, that
nothing that lives can enter under ground, without sudden
death, yet they continue there, and are not found to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
even where they have no access to escape, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
above ground. Or if it should be imagined, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
to some other place of the ground, where the <hi>Damp</hi>
is not, how is it, they are not as quickly choaked with
it, as <hi>Dogs</hi> are, and other <hi>Animals,</hi> which at the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
are killed?</p>
               <p>If it be inquired, how comes it to pass, that in these
Fields of <hi>Coals,</hi> which are dryed fully (as was said) and
to which these <hi>Damps</hi> are incident, because of corrupted
Air that remains within the Body of the <hi>Coal,</hi> or other
<hi>Metals,</hi> how comes it to pass (I say) that they are but
sometimes incident, and are not alwayes found? For clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, it is certain, that even in the grounds, where
these <hi>Damps</hi> are most frequent, for the reasons above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
yet they are only powerful when the Wind blows
from such a certain <hi>Point,</hi> as some Chimneys, that do only
smoke, when the Wind is in such an <hi>Airth.</hi> This is so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
and well known, that the <hi>Work-men</hi> observe it,
and when they find the Wind in such a Point, whence they
fear the <hi>Damp,</hi> they will not enter under ground, till tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
be made of the Air, which they do in <hi>Sinks,</hi> by first let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:106992:168"/>
down a lighted <hi>Candle,</hi> or some burning <hi>Coals:</hi> which
if they do not burn, then there is no access to enter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the wind in which this <hi>Ill Air</hi> is most noxious,
and hurtful, blows from that Point, where the Field of
<hi>Coal</hi> lyes, that's not yet wrought, which seems somewhat
strange, and yet when duely considered, it will appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
consonant to reason. An example of this is to
be found in the <hi>Coal</hi> of <hi>Tranent</hi> and <hi>Elphingston,</hi> the <hi>Streek</hi>
whereof goes to the <hi>rise</hi> of the Hill above ground, from
N E to S W, as hath been formerly observed. So that
the beginning of their <hi>Level,</hi> is at the N E point of the
<hi>Streek,</hi> from which the <hi>Coal</hi> hath been wrought up along
the <hi>Streek</hi> towards the S W, the <hi>Wastes</hi> lying all towards
the N E. Yet when the Wind blows from N E, or N,
or almost from any other Point of the Compass, they are
not troubled with this <hi>Damp.</hi> But if it blow from S W,
and blow hard, they are in hazard to encounter it. And
though the <hi>Damp</hi> is not alwayes found when that Wind
blows (whereof there may be some particular cause) yet
it is never observed in another Wind, whether it blow less
or mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e: the reason whereof may probably be, that the
Wind blowing from other Points, as from N, or N E,
hath more access to enter the <hi>Wastes</hi> under ground, and
move the Air that is in them, towards the face of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought
<hi>Coal,</hi> whence is supposed to proceed the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Air, that lurks in the <hi>Rifts</hi> and <hi>Cutters</hi> thereof, (from
which the Water is drawn away,) and occasions the <hi>Damp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
Now this Air being moved by the force of the Wind,
keeps the corrupt Air from coming out, it being stronger
then the other. Whereas, upon the contrary, while the
Wind blows from S W, it entering the empty <hi>Rooms,</hi>
drives the Air under ground from the face of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:106992:168"/>
                  <hi>Coal,</hi> down towards the <hi>old wastes,</hi> which have
their <hi>course</hi> from the beginning of the <hi>Level.</hi> By which
means, the Air, that is corrupted within the bowels (to
speak so) of the <hi>Coal,</hi> comes out to the <hi>Wastes,</hi> without
resistance, it being certain, that <hi>Fluid Bodies,</hi> as <hi>Water,</hi>
and <hi>Air,</hi> inclines to move towards that place, where they
meet with the least resistance. Hence is it, that the more
direct the Wind be, in blowing against the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ace of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought
<hi>Coal,</hi> as is the Wind from N E, the <hi>Ill Air</hi> is
the more repelled and driven back, but the more oblique
it be, as are the Winds from these Points, that are nearest
to S W, the <hi>Air</hi> is not so good and free: which difference
is known by the burning of <hi>Candles,</hi> they burning with
greater difficulty in these Winds, than in others, which
blow from these Points nearest to N, and N E. Some
are of opinion, this <hi>Ill Air</hi> (in those places we have been
speaking of) comes from the great <hi>Wastes,</hi> that ly above
the un-wrought <hi>Coal,</hi> and by strong S W Winds is driven
thorow the <hi>Cutters</hi> thereof. Or the Wind blowing from
that Point, and coming thorow these <hi>Cutters,</hi> brings the
corrupted Air alongs with it, even as, after a showr of
Rain, a spait of Water comes, and carries alongs with it,
both the foul Water and the clean, it meets with. Though
this may be probable, which seems to be your own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet the other seems to be more probable.</p>
               <p>The other sort of <hi>Damp,</hi> is that which they call <hi>want of
Air;</hi> and though the term be not altogether proper (there
being no space without some Air) yet there is a want of
Air, which is sufficient for respiration of <hi>Animals,</hi> or for
the burning of fire. This is ordinarily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ound in the vun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

                     </gap>s</hi> of <hi>Coals,</hi> where
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:106992:169"/>
the <hi>Sinks</hi> are very deep, and to evite the charge thereof,
there is some necessity to work as far under ground for win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>Coal,</hi> as is possible, without new <hi>Sinks.</hi> The cause
seems to be, that the Air under ground, in such cases,
wants communication with the Air above ground, because
it is found, that by giving more communication, the evil
is cured. Whence comes the necessity of <hi>Air-holes</hi> in
<hi>Levels,</hi> which are so many <hi>Sinks</hi> set down, for no other
use, but for giving Air to the <hi>Workers.</hi> Some are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that this defect might be supplied by the blowing of
Bellows, from above ground, through a Stroop of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or of some other thing, which must run along to the
end of the <hi>Level,</hi> for keeping the Air there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in motion. But
I have not yet heard, that it hath been made practicable.</p>
               <p>The effects of this <hi>Damp</hi> are not so dangerous, as these
of the other. 'Tis true, it will kill Animals, and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
burning <hi>Coals</hi> and <hi>Candles,</hi> but not so suddenly as the
former; and so people are not so readily surprized by it.
The other seems to kill by some poisonous quality: in this
<hi>Animals</hi> dies for want of sufficient Air for respiration.
Therefore in advancing in a <hi>Coal Room,</hi> or <hi>Level</hi> where this
is, you shall see the flame of the Candle grow less and less
by degrees, till at last it be totally extinguished, and the
person entering, shall find the difficulty of breathing grow
greater, as he advanceth forward, till at last he cannot
breath at all. Hence it is, that few or none are killed by
this kind of <hi>Damp,</hi> and all its prejudice is, that it renders
the work more chargeable, when there is a necessity to
remove it.</p>
               <p>For that, which they call <hi>Wild-fire,</hi> it being a thing not
incident, but to very few <hi>Coals,</hi> is less known, than any
of the rest of the accidents that follows <hi>Coals.</hi> The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:106992:169"/>
I have heard of it, is, that in some <hi>Coals,</hi> which
naturally are full of <hi>Oil,</hi> and that are (as they call them)
<hi>fatt Coals,</hi> there is a certain <hi>Fire,</hi> which is as a <hi>Meteor,</hi> and
I judge, that from its resemblance to <hi>Ignis fat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> which
the Vulgar termeth <hi>Wild fire,</hi> it hath the sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e name. It
seems to be composed of some <hi>fatt oily vapour,</hi> that goeth
out of the <hi>Coal,</hi> the <hi>Pores</hi> thereof being once opened, which
is kindled after the same manner, as those fires above ground
are, which are most ordinarily found in fatt, and marrish
ground. Of this fire it is reported, that in the day time, while
the <hi>Work men,</hi> are working in the <hi>Coal-roomes,</hi> it comes to no
height, though it be sometimes seen in little holes of the
<hi>Coal-wall,</hi> shining like kindled sulphure, but without force:
but when the <hi>Work-men</hi> are once removed, and have stayed
out all night, it gathers to such a strength, that at its first
encountering with fire, which the <hi>Coal-hewers</hi> are necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
to have, by taking in of light, it breaks out with
such a violence, that it kills any person, it finds in its way.
The reason, why it is without this force, while the <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
are in the place, seems to be this, that they working
with such violence, and motion as they do, do certainly
move the Air considerably, it being contained in so narrow
a place, as a <hi>Coal-room.</hi> And this Air being violented by
motion, moves that <hi>oily vapour,</hi> whereof the fire is formed,
so that it gets not liberty to unit it self, being dissipated
by the motion of the Air. But so soon, as the Air is still,
and quiet, after the <hi>Work-men</hi> are gone home, it units it
self, and gathers force, and therefore, so soon, as it meets
with fire, which is more forcible, than the flame that is
kindled in it, it rarifieth; the sulphurious parts being kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and forceth it self out, as powder out of a <hi>Gun.</hi> For
it hath been observed, that if any person stay in the <hi>Coal-sink</hi>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:106992:170"/>
while it breaks within the <hi>Coal-room,</hi> they are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being killed. The ordinary way by which the hurt
of it is prevented, is by a person that enters, before the
<hi>Work-men,</hi> who being covered with <hi>wet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sack-cloath,</hi> when
he comes near the <hi>Coal-wall,</hi> where the <hi>Fire</hi> is feared, he
creepeth on his belly, with a long <hi>Poll</hi> before him, with a
lighted candle on the end thereof, with whose flame the
<hi>Wild-fire</hi> meeting, breaketh with violence, and running
alongs the <hi>roof,</hi> goeth out with a noise, at the mouth of
the <hi>Sink,</hi> the person that gave fire, having escaped, by
creeping on the ground, and keeping his face close to it,
till it be over-passed, which is in a moment.</p>
               <p>The place, where this was most known, was in a <hi>Coal</hi>
be-west <hi>Leith,</hi> in a piece of Land called <hi>Werdy,</hi> which for
want of <hi>Level,</hi> and the violence of that <hi>Fire,</hi> the <hi>Owners</hi>
were forced to abandon.</p>
               <p>I come now to the last part, which I promised to speak
of, namely of the best way for trying of grounds, to find
<hi>Coal,</hi> where never any hath hitherto been discovered, and
of carrying on of <hi>Levels,</hi> for draining the Water of <hi>Coals</hi>
and making it workable. As to the first part, there are
but three wayes. First by <hi>sinking,</hi> which is most charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
in regard, that in such grounds, where the <hi>Metals</hi>
are all intire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Water abounds, and this doth not only bring
the <hi>Master</hi> under a necessity of great expence for drawing
the Water, but also rendereth it impossible to get <hi>sinked</hi>
to any deepness, which may suffice, for giving an account
of all the <hi>Metals</hi> to be found, within the field, that may
be rendred workable. There was a second way invented
to supply this defect, which is by <hi>boaring,</hi> with an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made of several <hi>Rods</hi> of Iron, which boareth thorow
the <hi>Metals,</hi> and tryes them. This way in my opinion, is
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:106992:170"/>
worse then the former. For first, if the <hi>Coal</hi> ly deep, in
the place where you try by boaring, it becomes almost as
tedious, and expensive, as <hi>sinking,</hi> the drawing of the
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>odes,</hi> consuming so much time, in regard it must be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
done. Next, in <hi>boaring,</hi> suppose the nature of
the <hi>Metals,</hi> be found, yet thereby their <hi>course</hi> can never
be known, till they be <hi>sinked,</hi> which is one of the things
most considerable in the search of a <hi>Coal,</hi> because thereby
is known, whether it be workable, with advantage or not,
and whether it be possible to draw Water from it by a <hi>Level,</hi>
or otherwise. Lastly, this way leaves the <hi>Master</hi> at an
uncertainty (notwithstanding the <hi>Coal</hi> had been found)
of its <hi>goodness,</hi> as to its <hi>nature,</hi> and as to its <hi>thickness.</hi> As
to its <hi>goodness,</hi> because all that is found of the <hi>Coal,</hi> by
this <hi>boaring instrument,</hi> is some small <hi>dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ss,</hi> which remains
after the washing of the thing that's brought up in the
<hi>wumble,</hi> by which none can judge of its <hi>goodness,</hi> or <hi>bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
As to its <hi>thickness,</hi> because it is impossible to discern
exactly, when the <hi>boaring-instrument</hi> hath passed the <hi>Coal:</hi>
all the rule for trying thereof, being the kind of <hi>Metal</hi> that
is brought up in the <hi>wumble.</hi> Now, I have known in my
experience a <hi>Coal boared,</hi> which the <hi>Boarer</hi> by that rule
hath judged four foot in <hi>thickness,</hi> yet when it came to be
<hi>sinked,</hi> hath not proven one. The reason whereof, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
because the <hi>boaring-irons,</hi> being long, and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in lifting them up, and down, they break the <hi>Coal,</hi>
already pierced; and this falling down among the <hi>Metals,</hi>
they are piercing, and being found in the <hi>wumble</hi> with
them (especially when the <hi>Metal</hi> under the <hi>Coal,</hi> is a <hi>black
Till</hi>) gives ground to imagine, that all that time, they
have been peircing a <hi>Coal,</hi> and so consequently, the <hi>Coal</hi>
must be of such a <hi>thickness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:106992:171"/>
The last, and best way of trial, is that which is termed
an <hi>ranging over the Metals.</hi> For doing whereof, this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
is to be observed. Suppose there be any place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the ground to be searched, where the course of <hi>Metals</hi>
can be seen, as in the <hi>banks</hi> of a <hi>River,</hi> or <hi>Rivolet,</hi> or <hi>Sea-banks,</hi>
when the place is near the Sea, then consideration
must be had how far the lowest of these <hi>Metals,</hi> can go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they <hi>Crop</hi> out to the <hi>Grass,</hi> which will be known by
observing the <hi>Dipp</hi> or declination of the <hi>Metals,</hi> and the
<hi>Rise</hi> of the ground above, whereof a just allowance must
be given, and having <hi>digged</hi> before the said <hi>Crop,</hi> you
shall certainly find, the <hi>Metal,</hi> that is next under it, and
if that prove not <hi>Coal,</hi> keeping the former proportion,
you must advance, and <hi>digg</hi> before its <hi>Crop,</hi> and so shall
you find, the next <hi>Metal</hi> under it, and so still, till you
have tried your ground, and found the <hi>Crops</hi> of all your
<hi>Metals</hi> within it. But if there be no <hi>Water-banks,</hi> or such
like, to give you the first view, of the course of your <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi>
then must you <hi>sink</hi> first at <hi>random,</hi> and having once
past the <hi>Clay,</hi> you will readily overtake some <hi>Metals,</hi>
whereby you will know the <hi>course</hi> of the rest, and having
once found the <hi>Dipp</hi> and <hi>Rise,</hi> you must follow the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of <hi>ranging</hi> already prescribed, except the ground so to
be tried, contains not within it self the <hi>Crops</hi> of the <hi>Metals,</hi>
the body whereof lies in it, whether of <hi>Coal,</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> in
that case, there is no way to try, but by <hi>sinking,</hi> or <hi>boar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
The way of <hi>ranging</hi> is conspicuous in the following
figure.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>The piece of ground to be tried, is P N, where there
are several <hi>Seams</hi> of <hi>Metals,</hi> that <hi>Cropps</hi> out at the Points
K L M N. Suppose the lowest to be the <hi>Coal, viz.</hi> I N,
for which you are to make trial. You <hi>Digg</hi> first at K,
without the <hi>Cropp</hi> of the <hi>Seam</hi> F K, and you <hi>dig</hi> till you
find the other <hi>Seam</hi> of <hi>Stone</hi> G L, at the Point C. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the Rule before given, you advance before its <hi>cropp,</hi>
and <hi>diggs</hi> at L, and finds the other <hi>Seam</hi> of <hi>Stone</hi> H M, at
the point D: from which you also advance, and <hi>diggs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
its <hi>cropp,</hi> at the point M, and finds your <hi>Coal</hi> at the
point E. But, if by advancing over the <hi>cropps</hi> of these
<hi>Metals,</hi> which comes out from under one another, you
find no <hi>Coal;</hi> then you are to <hi>range</hi> backward, for the
<hi>cropps</hi> of <hi>Metals</hi> lying above these, where haply the <hi>Coal</hi>
may be, as at O, and P. This in my opinion, is the most
certain and exact way of trying Fields for <hi>Coal,</hi> or any other
<hi>Metal</hi> of that nature, and least chargeable of all others.</p>
               <p>The second of this last part, I promised to speak of,
was in order to <hi>Levels,</hi> or <hi>Coal-Mines,</hi> which are nothing
else, but <hi>Conduits</hi> or <hi>Gutters</hi> made under ground, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
of the Water from the <hi>Coal,</hi> and so rendering it
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:106992:172"/>
workable. It seems that a very little time before this,
that way of <hi>Mineing</hi> under ground hath not been fallen
upon. For there are to be found <hi>Coals</hi> wasted in their
Cropps only; for conveying the Water whereof, they have
made a <hi>Conduit,</hi> or <hi>Level,</hi> which hath been <hi>open to the
Surface,</hi> like a great <hi>Ditch,</hi> some whereof have been ten
or twelve fathom in their deepness.</p>
               <p>The beginning of the <hi>Level</hi> (to keep the term used)
must alwayes be at the lowest part of the Field, where the
<hi>Coal</hi> lyes to be dryed. Some whereof, by the <hi>rising</hi> of the
ground, and the <hi>Streek</hi> of the <hi>Coal</hi> rising that way (as we
shew before) gives the advantage of a <hi>Free Level,</hi> that is,
when the Water comes above ground of its own accord,
without being forced by drawing. In others, there is a
necessity of <hi>Engines</hi> to draw the Water from the lowest
part of the <hi>Level,</hi> and bring it above ground; which <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines</hi>
are of several sorts. As when <hi>men drew</hi> with ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>Buckets,</hi> or when there is a <hi>horse-work,</hi> or <hi>water-work,</hi>
and that either by a <hi>Chain</hi> with <hi>Plates,</hi> and a <hi>Pump,</hi> or
with a <hi>Chain</hi> and <hi>Buckets;</hi> all which are very common,
especially those we have in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they being capable to
draw but a very small draught, making only use of one <hi>Sink</hi>
for that effect. But there are to be seen in the North of
<hi>England,</hi> in <hi>Bishoprick, Water-works,</hi> by which Water is
drawn above 40 fathom in perpendicular, but not all in one
<hi>Sink.</hi> The manner whereof is thus, there being a <hi>Sink</hi>
from the end of their <hi>Level,</hi> to the surface of the earth,
where their <hi>Works</hi> are going, 40 fathom deep, which must
dry the <hi>Coal-Sinks</hi> at 60 or 70, which ly above the <hi>Banks</hi>
of the <hi>River,</hi> where the <hi>Water-works</hi> are scituated, there
is first one 40 fathom deep from the <hi>Grass.</hi> Another in a
right Line from that, of 24. Another of 12; upon all which
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:106992:172"/>
there are <hi>Water-works.</hi> In the first <hi>Sink</hi> the Water is drawn
from the bottom 12 fathom, and thence conveyed into a
<hi>Level</hi> or <hi>Mine,</hi> which carries it away to the second <hi>Sink.</hi>
By the second <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ork,</hi> the Water is drawn out of the second
<hi>Sink</hi> 14 fathom, from the bottom, and set in by a <hi>Level</hi>
to the third <hi>Sink,</hi> which being only 12 fathom deep, the
<hi>Water-work</hi> sets it above ground. The form of the <hi>Engine</hi>
is after this manner. In the first <hi>Sink</hi> there is an <hi>Outter-wheel</hi>
moved, as other <hi>Milns</hi> are, by the Water of the
River: upon the end of the <hi>Axle-tree</hi> of which <hi>Wheel,</hi> there
is a <hi>Ragg-wheel,</hi> turning <hi>vertically,</hi> as doth the <hi>Outer-wheel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
This <hi>Ragg-wheel</hi> by a <hi>Nutt,</hi> or <hi>Trinle</hi> turns another, which
moves <hi>horizontally,</hi> the <hi>Axle-tree</hi> whereof goes right down
in the <hi>Sink,</hi> and may be is 8 or 10 fathom; at the end
whereof there is another <hi>Ragg,</hi> which by a <hi>Nutt</hi> turns ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Wheel,</hi> which goes <hi>vertically</hi> as the first <hi>Ragg,</hi> and
causeth another Wheel with a long <hi>Axle-tree</hi> turn as the
first, and so down till it come to the <hi>Wheel,</hi> which turns the
<hi>Axle-tree,</hi> by which the <hi>Chain</hi> is drawn. The second
<hi>Sink,</hi> hath such another <hi>Engine,</hi> but not so many <hi>Wheels,</hi>
in regard it is not so deep. The third, hath only one <hi>single
Wheel,</hi> whereby the Water is drawn above ground.</p>
               <p>The most curious of these <hi>Engines,</hi> that are to be seen,
are at <hi>Ravensworth</hi> near to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> which belongs to
Sir <hi>Thomas Liddel,</hi> a most ingenious Gentleman, who, for
procuring a <hi>Fall</hi> of Water, which may serve the <hi>Wheels</hi> of
all the three <hi>Sinks,</hi> hath erected the first work upon Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
like a <hi>Wind-Mill,</hi> pretty high above ground, from
which the Water falling, makes the second go closs above
ground. And to make the Water fall to the third, the
whole <hi>Wheel</hi> is made go within the <hi>surface</hi> of the ground,
which <hi>terminats</hi> at a <hi>River</hi> under the <hi>Works,</hi> which <hi>Mine</hi>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:106992:173"/>
is of a considerable length. Where Water cannot be had
to make such <hi>Works</hi> go, they use <hi>Horse-works,</hi> but not w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th
so good success, being more chargeable, and not having
so much force and power, as the <hi>Water-works.</hi> But I am
of opinion, that <hi>Wind-works</hi> might serve well, where Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cannot be had; and when no Wind should happen to
blow, the same <hi>Works</hi> might be supplied by <hi>Horse:</hi> and
that the <hi>Wind,</hi> when it blows but ordinarily, hath as much
force, as so much Water, which is made use of for turning
such <hi>Wheels,</hi> is to me unquestionable. For I have seen in
<hi>Holland,</hi> a <hi>Wind-Mill,</hi> that by the motion of the <hi>Outter-wheel,</hi>
caused seven pair of <hi>Mill-stones</hi> to go at once, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
another motion for bringing the <hi>Victual</hi> from the
ground, four or five Stories high, to be <hi>Grund.</hi> And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Saw-Mills,</hi> which besides six or seven great <hi>Saws,</hi>
they caused go, did by another motion bring up from the
<hi>Water</hi> great <hi>Trees</hi> like <hi>Ship-Masts,</hi> to be <hi>fawen,</hi> and placed
them right against the <hi>Saw;</hi> all which could not be but of
greater weight, than 10 or 12 fathom of <hi>Chain</hi> with <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,</hi>
or <hi>Plates</hi> for drawing of Water.</p>
               <p>But to return, for the right making of a <hi>Level,</hi> the true
hight of the ground, where the <hi>Coal</hi> lyes must be first ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
that it may be known, how much of the field can be
drained by it; which must be done, either with a <hi>Quadrant,</hi>
or with an Instrument made express. Then care must be
taken, to take the lowest part for the mouth of the <hi>Level,</hi>
that the field can afford, and from that it must be carried
in a straight line towards that part of the field, where the
<hi>Coal</hi> is thought to be encountered by the <hi>Mine.</hi> In work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof, two things are in a special manner to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded.
First, that the <hi>Level</hi> be wrought without <hi>ascent,</hi>
or <hi>descent:</hi> the best way for trying this, being by the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:106992:173"/>
of the Water passing through it, which ought to be as
little moving, as can be: for the loss of one foot of <hi>Level,</hi>
which the ground gives, is a loss of a considerab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e parcel
of <hi>Coal</hi> to be digged, especially if it be <hi>flate.</hi> It there occur
any <hi>Metals,</hi> which are impregnable, in the <hi>course</hi> of the
<hi>Level,</hi> so that it is impossible, to follow so straight a line, in
regard the <hi>Mine</hi> must be wrought over the top of that
stone, which is unworkable, in that case, there is but one
of two to serve the loss of <hi>Level;</hi> either the <hi>Coal</hi> rises i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>Streek</hi> towards which the <hi>Mine</hi> is carried, and if that be,
then after that <hi>stone</hi> is past, the <hi>Level</hi> must be carried, as
low, as it was before it encountered the same, and the
<hi>course</hi> of the Water shall not be obstructed, because the
<hi>sourse,</hi> viz. the <hi>Coal</hi> from whence the Water comes, rising
higher than the <hi>Stone,</hi> the Water shall easily pass over that
hight. Hence it is, that we see in some <hi>Coals,</hi> that have
been wrought, at the lowest point of their <hi>Streek</hi> by a
<hi>drawing-sink,</hi> and the <hi>Streek</hi> rising from that point, the
Water that hath come off the <hi>Coal,</hi> being in its <hi>Sourse</hi>
higher, than the mouth of that <hi>drawing-sink,</hi> hath mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
it to over-run, and serve to discharge all the Water, that
comes therefrom. But, if the <hi>Mine</hi> be run to a <hi>Coal,</hi> that
after it hath overtaken it, rises no higher in <hi>Streek,</hi> than
the <hi>Mine</hi> it self, the Water that comes from it, will not
pass over any hight in its way, but will be unquestionably
stopped. Therefore, in case such an impediment could
not be removed, as many times such <hi>Metals</hi> will fall in,
which are unworkable in a direct line, the use of a <hi>Siph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n</hi>
might be tried, which would unquestionably supply the
loss of about 32 foot of <hi>Level,</hi> this being the hight in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular,
to which the <hi>Pressure</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> is able to raise
Water up thorow a <hi>Siphon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:106992:174"/>
The next thing to be observed in carrying on of <hi>Levels,</hi>
are the <hi>Air-holes,</hi> for which there is a necessity indispens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
In setting down whereof, care must be had, that
they be not directly upon the <hi>Mine,</hi> lest <hi>rubbish</hi> falling tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
from above ground, should stop, and obstruct the
same, and so obstruct the <hi>course</hi> of the Water; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it's better they be set down at a <hi>side,</hi> their only use
being to communicate fresh Air to the <hi>Work-men,</hi> which if
it could be otherwise supplied (as I think it not utterly
impossible) would render the charge of the <hi>Coal-works</hi> a
great deal more easy.</p>
               <p>Other things might be spoken to of <hi>Levels,</hi> as that
some run with the <hi>course</hi> of <hi>Metals,</hi> they pass thorow; and
that some run against that <hi>course;</hi> and of bringing <hi>Level</hi>
from the <hi>Dip</hi> of an <hi>upper-Coal,</hi> which hath a <hi>Level</hi> of its
own, to dry a <hi>Coal</hi> lying under it, which cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
done. But these things being common and obvious to
any, who have but the smallest skill and experience, I
shall forbear.</p>
               <p>This confused account, your importunity hath drawen
from me, for which if your <hi>Book</hi> suffer censure, which I
grant it may do, as to this part of it, you are to blame your
self, and so I rest and am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

I had confidence, and whom I judged my real friends. Among
others, I sent over to Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> one of my Edicts, to one
or two there, in whom I trusted, but in stead of a kindly return
from them, to whom I had written most affectionatly, they wrot
back a Letter, wherein they superciliously condemn the purposes
of this Book, before ever they had seen them, which is as follows.</p>

debate, I returned a most discreet answer, thinking to conquer their
humour with civility, and kindness, but not long after, hearing of
their clamour against the Intimation, and of their disswading

nothing but good-will; else, you and they should never have been

            <p>IN answer to this last, there came to my hands from <hi>St. Andrews</hi>
a Letter unsubscribed by any Master, full of barbarous railings,
passing all bounds of civility, against my self, friends, and works,
which, if the <hi>Contrivers</hi> had not been more gall'd with reason, then
injuries, I suppose they would have forborn. And thinking this
not sufficient, they would needs aggravate the wrong, by one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
more, which they either did out of <hi>disdain,</hi> or <hi>fear,</hi>
not daring to own what they had contrived, in making the <hi>Bedale</hi>
of the University subscribe it. And to give a further proof of their
insatiable malice, they must needs distribute copies thereof, as glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
in their shame, one whereof was sent over to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subscribed
also. Now, let any indifferent person judge, whether
or not, I have not reason to do what I have done. They have
been the first proclaimers, though in a <hi>clandestine</hi> way, and why
not I next, in this way. But lest, they think, they have marred
as much the tranquillity of my mind therewith, as they have their
own. I shall answer in the words of the Moralist, <hi>Eleganter Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius

            <p>March 14. 1672.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Patrick Mathers,</hi> Arch-bedale
to the University of <hi>St. Andrews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is not this to do, as the <hi>Butcher</hi> did, who sought his knife, when
it was sticking in his teeth. If the University ordered this subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it would have been said, <hi>at the command of the University.</hi>
If not, it cannot be purged from a false insinuation: and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
may justly resent it, that their publick servant, hath been
so abused. If the fear of a counterblow hath made him afraid, to
put his hand to it, he hath done as the <hi>Ape</hi> did, that thrust the <hi>Cats</hi>
foot into the fire, because he durst not do it himself, and given a
palpable discovery of the diffidence he had of his cause. If he hath
done it, to put indignity on his adversary, he hath missed his mark,
for as a certain Writer saith well, <hi>Infamy is as it is received. If
thou be Mud-wall it will stick: if Marble it will rebound: if thou
storm at it, it is thine: if thou despise it</hi> (as I do this) <hi>it is his.</hi>
But besides this, he endeavoureth to put Mr. <hi>Iames Gregory</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and me also, and bringeth him in speaking of my writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
with such a deal of disdain and sauciness, <hi>ut nihil supra.</hi> What?
was Mr. <hi>Iames Gregory</hi> such an eminent person, that he could not
speak his thoughts himself, but needeth you Sir, for a <hi>Proxy,</hi> and
Chancellour to speak for him. If Mr. <hi>Iames Gregory</hi> will speak to
me, what you have spoken in his name, he shall have an answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But I have no mind to gratify so far your <hi>doli,</hi> and <hi>fallacia,</hi> as to
fall on any man upon your word, having so little confidence of
your common honesty. This were <hi>perversam gratiam gratificari.</hi>
Wherefore passing his impertinent railings, I come to answer, what
he hath returned to my purposes in my last. And that he may get
no wrong, I shall set down the very words of his Letter, <hi>viz; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

themselves in this, though they be ashamed to acknowledge so
much; for what a pitiful shift is it, to bring <hi>Geography</hi> for an instance
of a perfected Science, when so much of the Earth remains to this

known parts, how little is there to this day sufficiently described by
the exactest <hi>Mapps,</hi> that time, and labours of men have yet produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
And now to retort your own question upon your self, <hi>ubi est
sapientia ad quam putatis vos pervenisse?</hi> O but saith the Author,
<hi>it is perfected as to its scientifical part.</hi> But I pray you <hi>Sir,</hi> what is
this, though you may be a teacher of <hi>Logick</hi> of no small esteem

                  </gap>cal part</hi> of <hi>Geography,</hi> which you alledge to
be perfected, in this also you argue against the rules of <hi>Logick,</hi> in
committing that same <hi>Fallacy</hi> over again, for giving and not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what you say, that the <hi>Scientifical part of Geography</hi> were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
as to the <hi>projection, description, and situation</hi> of a place, is
it for this perfected as to the <hi>Scientifical part simpliciter,</hi> which you
are obliged to prove, else you say nothing to the purpose. And
what I pray you, is that poor alleadgence you make, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of these things, wherein <hi>Geography</hi> is defective, even as to the
<hi>Scientifical part?</hi> Who hath spoken yet sufficiently to the <hi>surface,</hi>
and hight of the <hi>Sea</hi> above the <hi>Earth,</hi> the hight of the <hi>Hills,</hi> and
<hi>Mountains, Longitude</hi> of places, nay the circumference of the Earth
it self? Answer this question, if you can, <hi>Hast thou perceived the
breadth of the earth, declare if thou knowest it all?</hi> Job. 38. 18.
And now Sir, I must put you to it again, <hi>ubi est sapientia ad quam
putatis vos perverisse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His next answer runneth thus, <hi>The Scientifical part of the Opticks
is so perfected, that nothing can be required for the perfection of the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:106992:178"/>
sight, which is not demonstrat, albeit mens hands cannot reach it.
And these being the objects, of the foresaid Sciences</hi> (you should <hi>Sir,</hi>
have said, the whole objects of the foresaid Sciences, else you still
play the Sophister) <hi>your authority shall not perswade him, or us, that
it is altogether improper to call them perfect.</hi> But mark Reader,
how the force of reason maketh these <hi>Authors</hi> to succumb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for
whereas they should have said, <hi>that it is not improper to call them
perfect,</hi> they qualify it thus, it is not <hi>altogether</hi> improper. And
again, <hi>your authority shall not perswade us, that it is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper.</hi>
But (<hi>my Masters</hi>) I do not crave that my authority
may perswade you, but reason. Wherefore to return: <hi>the Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical
part of the Opticks</hi> (say they) <hi>is so perfected, that nothing
can be required for the perfection of the sight, which is not demonstrat,
albeit mens hands cannot reach it.</hi> But where <hi>Sir,</hi> and by what
person is this done? Shew me the man, (if you can) that hath done
it. But though all this were true, were therefore, either the <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
Dioptricks, or Catoptricks</hi> perfected Sciences? Who hath
yet sufficiently explained the manner <hi>how we see,</hi> far less how <hi>Birds,</hi>
and <hi>Fishes, Beasts,</hi> and <hi>Insects</hi> see? How the <hi>Eagle</hi> mounting aloft
spyeth her prey from a far. Who hath spoken sufficiently to the
nature of <hi>colours?</hi> For these also belong to the <hi>Opticks,</hi> or of <hi>light,</hi>
and of the <hi>infraction,</hi> and <hi>refraction</hi> thereof. The learned <hi>Lord
Verulam</hi> was not of your mind <hi>Sir,</hi> when he wrot thus, <hi>De forma

            <p>If Mr. <hi>Newton</hi> has been of this <hi>Authors</hi> mind, he should not have
attempted the late invention of his <hi>Span-long Dioptrical-catoptrical
Prospect,</hi> whereby <hi>Iupiter</hi> his <hi>Satellites,</hi> and <hi>Venus horned</hi> are to
be seen. And if Mr. <hi>Hook,</hi> had been of his mind, he should not
have made his late <hi>Proposal</hi> of <hi>Telescopes, Microscopes, Scotoscopes,</hi>
by figures as easily made, as those that are plain and spherical,
whereby the <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>Magnitude</hi> of <hi>Objects,</hi> may be prodigio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

almost desired in <hi>Dioptricks,</hi> may be accomplished. Where ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve

(Reader) how that ingenuous person, is so far from the <hi>win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
language</hi> of this Author, that he doth not say, <hi>whatsoever can
be required for the perfection of sight is demonstrat,</hi> or any thing like
it, but <hi>whatsoever hath been hitherto attempted, or almost desired.</hi>
For who can tell, what shall be found out hereafter, even in these
things. To them we may borrow the words of the Poet,
<q>
                  <l>Prudens futuri temporis exitum</l>
                  <l>Caliginosâ nocte premit Deus.</l>
               </q>
So, Sir, I still put you to that question, <hi>Ubi est sapientia ad quam
put at is vos pervenisse?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place he falleth upon the <hi>Hydrostaticks,</hi> which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
he looked upon as a Science perfected long ago. But because
in his answer, he in effect yeelds the cause, I pursue him no further.
<hi>Habemus confitentem reum,</hi> while he expresly grants, <hi>there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things yet</hi> (saith he) <hi>relating to the proportion and acceleration of
the motion of Fluids, which are yet unknown.</hi> As for his reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon what I have written in my <hi>Ars Nova,</hi> concerning a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
motion, which I never intended to demonstrat, I leave them
as <hi>indicia agri &amp; impotent is animi.</hi> I proceed to answer him i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
what he addeth thus. <hi>Only we cannot but admire your simplicity in
this, Astronomy seeketh alwayes to have the greatest intervalls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twix

                  </gap>phism,
ab ignor atione Elenchi?</hi> for it doth not contradict my conclusion,
which is, that Astronomical Observations, by this mean, and the
Oscillatory Clock, may be made to a second of time, which is of
so great importance in <hi>Astronomy.</hi> But mark the <hi>Non-sense</hi> (Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
<hi>the invention</hi> (saith he) <hi>had been much greater, if the eye
had been away:</hi> that is, the invention of this Observation had been
much greater, if the <hi>eye,</hi> that is, the <hi>Observation</hi> had been away.
In this they have outshot themselves also; and what they spoke
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:106992:179"/>
unadvisedly before, they will now speak deliberatly, and defend
it rather by <hi>Sophistry</hi> and <hi>Non-sense,</hi> then yeeld to the truth.</p>

learning, will soon find them out. If he do it not, let him know, that
I keep them for a <hi>reserve.</hi> To speak nothing of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who

perfected it more with judicious Experiments, than ye would do by all
appearance in ten ages.</hi> But I pray you, Sir, did <hi>Des-cartes,</hi> and
<hi>Epicurus,</hi> and the like, found their <hi>Philosophy</hi> on <hi>Natural History,</hi>
and not rather upon their own <hi>precarious principles:</hi> and therefore
have quite missed the mark, and method, that was requisite for the
advancement of Learning, and have been so far from <hi>grasping</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that it hath <hi>flowen</hi> out from among their hands. As for what
he talketh of <hi>Des-cartes,</hi> perfecting <hi>Natural History</hi> by <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
if he had done it, as the Poet saith in another sense,
<q>Non mihi res, sed me rebus componere conor.</q>
he had done right. But when he took pains on these; to force them
to a compliance with his own <hi>fancies,</hi> was not this to study <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
History,</hi> as <hi>Hereticks</hi> do the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and to be a <hi>Fanatick
Philosopher,</hi> and a fit Master for the like of you. The <hi>Proteus of
Nature,</hi> must be bound with stronger Chains, then the <hi>fantastick
Nugae of Des-cartes,</hi> before he will tell his secrets. The vanity of
whose method may be seen in the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who having laid
down this precarious principle, that <hi>the sense cannot erre,</hi> do turn
