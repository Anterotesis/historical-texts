            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>I Being one of the Auditors, and ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>appealed</hi> unto by thee ſomtimes to do thee Right and Juſtice; at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-times by ſeveral Applications thou waſt pleaſed to make in thy Diſcourſes, both to thy Friends and friendly Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; I am preſſed in mind to acquaint thee with my <hi>Sentiment</hi> and Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons this way, (that ſo thy Appeal might not be idle) not having the convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy nor admittance to do it there.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, I do really own that thou haſt a Voluble Tongue, a ſtrong Voice and clear, a grateful Ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, and I believe good Lungs;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109270:4"/>
that thou art to be commended for an excellent Rhetorician, and a fluent Tongue; and ſo was <hi>Cicero:</hi> But all this as it made not him, ſo it will not prove thee, a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>; and therefore as thou didſt not deny him to be Wiſer than thee, ſo it was not over-needful for thee to Query whether he was Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſince ſomtimes thou canſt tells us, that <hi>All Men</hi> are enlightned with a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Light, <hi>which Light is Chriſt in them,</hi> and <hi>ſo</hi> conſequently <hi>Cicero</hi> might be a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> as well as thee, if he was a Man; and yet when thou thoughteſt it would ſerve thy turn, thou couldſt call him ignominiouſly <hi>Heathen</hi> as others do: But this rather deſerves the name of playing <hi>Faſt and Looſe</hi> than Quibbling.</p>
                  <p>Fine Words may catch <hi>Fools,</hi> and may take with them that ſee no further than th'outſide, and let ſuch be taken if they pleaſe; But any that are able to diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>Words,</hi> and the <hi>true Sence of them,</hi> and is willing ſeriouſly to conſider of them, can never be in danger; and for others they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be deceived. I have heard as plauſible a Harangue, as eloquent an Oration from a Jeſuite, wherein he painted the poor <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in ſuch Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, that he ſet them forth to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors more like ſome ſtrange Monſters, than Men indued with Senſe or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109270:4"/>
but yet I cannot believe the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites ever the better Chriſtians for that.</p>
                  <p>Hadſt thou had this <hi>Gift</hi> of a fluent Tongue and a good Voice <hi>meerly by thy turning Quaker,</hi> (and not partly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and partly acquired at Our <hi>Schools,</hi> which now proudly thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneſt) then ſhould I more highly eſteem of it, and that would more Convince me of the <hi>Truth of thy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> than all the Arguments I heard that day from thee, or could ever hear from thy Friends.</p>
                  <p>The Members of the <hi>True Church</hi> in the Apoſtles time, had the <hi>GIFT OF TONG<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ES</hi> immediately <hi>inſpired into</hi> them, upon their becoming <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> without acquiring it by Study: And if thou canſt ſhew me one in thy Church that hath ſuch a <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109270:7"/>
beſt of my underſtanding, Thou and thy Friends <hi>did not there deal fairly,</hi> candidly, or Chriſtianly in ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that when <hi>T. Hicks</hi> had ſaid, that <hi>moſt</hi> of the Particulars he would prove, thou took'ſt the words out of his <hi>Mouth</hi> before he had made an end of his Sentence, and cryedſt out, oh then it ſeems he owns he cannot prove them <hi>all,</hi> or words to that effect; whereas if thou hadſt given him leave, as he told thee afterwards, Moſt of them he would prove from thy Principles, and the reſt by Teſtimonies: and ſo here by thy haſte, to expreſs it in thy own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, thou madeſt thy ſelf the Author of a Lye, and deal'ſt not <hi>Chriſtianly</hi>; and therein thou ſhewedſt thy ſelf not only a <hi>Fool</hi> but <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt</hi>; for thou ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to have heard the Matter out, before thou hadſt paſſed Sentence: and thus all might ſee how <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Proverb was true of thee; <hi>He that anſwereth a Matter</hi> [<hi>Hebr.</hi> returneth a word] <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he heareth it, it is folly and ſhame unto him,</hi> Prov. 18.13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that thou trifledſt away ſo much precious time, and cauſed your Auditors to loſe theirs, to the grand diſguſt of many, if not moſt of them, before thou wouldſt be brought to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree the Diſpute of that Particular which was moſt important; which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109270:8"/>
to many was Argument enough that ye were loath and unwilling to come to it; and thou hadſt a ſhift for that too, ſaying, Thou wouldſt go over the whole Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if thou didſt not well know, at leaſt gueſs, That it was not likely then thou ſhouldſt come to it at all that Meeting, and ſo hadſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpin out thy Own and Auditors time about frivolous Things and petty Stories, and yet at laſt didſt agree to it. What reaſon is there that all Men muſt diſpute in thy Method, or according to thy Will? Were not the Terms mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually agreed on before? If not, it had been ſober Wiſdom to have done it, and in default to have condeſcended to the Judgment of the Auditors. Was it not a ſhameful thing, that all the ſence of ſo many hours Diſpute may be put into leſs than half a ſheet of Paper, and that in a great meaſure through your <hi>Refractorineſs</hi> or Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In that there was three or four of you that ſpake, three of you very much by turns, and ſomtimes more than one of you together at a time; and when thou ſat down, <hi>George Whitehead</hi> ſtood up to aſſiſt thee, and then <hi>Keith,</hi> and ſo round and round again; and yet if <hi>Jer. Ives</hi> or another did begin to ſpeak, ye would cry out <hi>Hicks, Hicks, Hicks,</hi> it is him we will hear;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109270:8"/>
when as (if I am not miſinformed) in the conditions of the Diſputation, thou or thy Friends <hi>agreed Hicks</hi> might have two or three Perſons of his own chuſing, and you the like of your Election: If ſo, Then waſt thou faithful and juſt to thy Agreement? Or if not ſo, waſt thou then reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in thy ſelf, to oppoſe thy ſelf with three men beſides againſt one? Or didſt thou intend he might have them with him, but thou to command them ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or at beſt not hear them or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them; take which way thou wilt, it was not fair: Beſides, canſt thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed judg that the Nature of all Men is of a-like ſtrength, or that <hi>T. Hicks</hi>'s Nature was ſo ſtrong, as able to hold out ſpeaking and reaſoning againſt three or four? If ſo, I think thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may be as large as a <hi>Fryars</hi> Sleeve: But it ſeems with you it is no matter what, how foul or unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoever, ſo it may but make for the <hi>Quakers</hi> Victory or Advantage: This I think was not fair dealing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In that when thy Friends have ſo often diſowned and denyed <hi>Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> Thou and thy Friends ſhould then anſwer by Diſtinction, and ſay, Our Friends Words are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with this <hi>Diſtinction,</hi> of Chriſt in reſpect of his Godhead, or Chriſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109270:9"/>
in his Excellency, whereas there's no ſuch <hi>Diſtinction ſet down by your Friend, or in your Friends Book:</hi> And indeed if your Friends Words have not deceived me, <hi>you own nothing but the Divine Nature to be Chriſt</hi>; and then, How could any ſuch Diſtinction take place, if it had been there, ſo as to make your Friend mean (directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his own words) That Chriſt was ſeen with Carnal Eyes? Is not this then one of your Quibbles? For although thereby you make your Friend's words to be double, with two faces, to ſay one thing and mean another, Yet your own Principles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Chriſt, obſtructs you ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely from clearing them, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Hicks</hi> a Forger in that Particular: Neither can that Diſtinction ſerve you, except you will alter your Principle, and hold that there are two Natures, which are both united in One Perſon, The Chriſt, which yet I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand you are free to do.</p>
                  <p>Might not <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi> then rather have ſaid in thy own language, <hi>Thou art a Forger, and haſt forged this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,</hi> and ſuch a ſilly one as is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to hold good, if thy Principle touching The Chriſt hold true? Canſt thou be ignorant that this was only an Evaſion, or no better than a Quibble? Conſider with thy ſelf, and Thou
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109270:9"/>
mayeſt ſee how eaſily it is ſeen through.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In that when upon the Real Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this thy Diſtinction, the Queſtion was askt thee, <hi>Whether Chriſt's Humane Nature was a part of Chriſt?</hi> Or, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Body that was ſeen with Carnal (or Corporeal) Eyes, and heard with Carnal (or Corporeal) Ears was the Chriſt?</hi> Thou ſo long refuſedſt to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; when if only innocency had been in thee, plain-heartedneſs, and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſimplicity, thou mighteſt have done it in one word or two; but inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I believe thou madeſt above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and them to no purpoſe but to evade an Anſwer, (contrary to your former <hi>Rule, Let your Yea, be yea, and your Nay, nay</hi>; for <hi>whatſoever is more cometh of evil</hi>); One while thou wouldſt tell us that which was not askt nor deſired of thee, That the Body in Scripture was <hi>ſomtimes called Chriſt,</hi> and yet all the endeavours could not bring thee to ſay (that I could hear) that, <hi>That Body was Chriſt</hi>; Here's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of thy <hi>Quibbles:</hi> Is it not a pritty one, that thou ſhouldſt tell us, that ſometimes the Scripture calls the Body (or the Humane Nature) Chriſt, and yet doſt not believe that <hi>it is indeed what the Scripture calls it?</hi> The Word Chriſt is ſomtimes applied in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

                     <hi>Body</hi> of Chriſt <hi>is not, nor was, the true Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>the Spirit in that Body.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now either thou and thy Friends do hold theſe <hi>Doctrines,</hi> or the contrary: if either I or others have miſtaken you herein, through your own Friends ill expreſſing themſelves; or if you have ſince changed your Opinion in this particular, what hurt can there be, and why ſhouldſt thou be ſo nice, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us truly, honeſtly, and plainly like a Chriſtian?

                  <p>Here are great Conteſts and Diſputes betwixt the Baptiſts and your Church: the Baptiſts ſay we are true Chriſtians, and you Quakers are not: The Quakers
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109270:16"/>
ſay we are the true Chriſtians, and our way is the true way, and you Baptiſts are not: Now I and thouſands of poor Souls beſides, would willingly know which of you two are undoubtedly in the <hi>Right,</hi> and which of you indeed are falſe and pretenders only.</p>
                  <p>If any of thy Friends ſhall tell me, <hi>We are in the Truth,</hi> and therefore we are the true Church; Thou knoweſt in thy Conſcience, that is ſo far from an Anſwer, that it is only a <hi>ſhameful begging of the Queſtion:</hi> For the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> they pretend as much that <hi>they are in the Truth,</hi> as thou doſt, and it is yet to be decided betwixt you; ſo that that is ſtill the Queſtion. If thou ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the <hi>Light within me</hi> will teſtifie to thy Way, I profeſs really, I have min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and inquired of the Light within me what it ſays in that Particular, <hi>and it teſtifies no ſuch thing.</hi> If thou ſayeſt it is Demonſtrable <hi>by the Effects</hi> and Fruits: very well, I have inquired into that alſo, and I find none among You, but what may be found amongſt the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> alſo, Except it be keeping on the Hat, and ſaying Thou and Thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which alſo the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> or any others, may and can do if they pleaſe as well as you.</p>

                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:109270:17"/>Or if thy Friends ſhould tell me, <hi>That ye have the Spirit,</hi> and are in <hi>the Power of God</hi>; ſo ſay the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> that they have: And <hi>wherein does the Power of God,</hi> or <hi>the Spirit ſhew it ſelf more in you, than in them?</hi> If thou ſhouldſt ſay <hi>it is Within,</hi> but does not Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it ſelf Outwardly; Why then, do you trouble the Minds of People! Can you not let it keep in its place in every one where you ſay it is! and then thereby thou wouldſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg <hi>the Baptiſts to be Externally as good Chriſtians as your ſelves</hi>; and ſo may be Internally for ought thou canſt ſee, if it cannot demonſtrate it ſelf out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. So as to <hi>Divine Inſpiration</hi> now immediately by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as the Apoſtles had. Why <hi>G. What if God will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſuch gifts and ſigns now, muſt we therefore be no Chriſtians</hi>?</p>

                  <p>Why alas <hi>George! What if God will not beſtow ſuch Gifts</hi> and <hi>Signs now? Muſt we therefore be no Chriſtians</hi>?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. So for the <hi>Light within,</hi> which the Quakers ſo much talk of and pretend to, as their great Principle; <hi>What if God will not beſtow ſuch Gifts and Light now, muſt we therefore be no Chriſtians</hi>?</p>

impudence) and it will be impoſſible for the Quakers to fix any thing upon them: let them but ſay (as why may they not as well as the Quakers, if they have but ſo much confidence) <hi>ſuch titles or words are not ſtrictly but figuratively placed in or on our Books</hi> And all's done. And therefore here I think, I might on this ground of the Quakers (if they will have that to be admitted) undertake to do Mr. <hi>Hicks</hi> that ſervice <hi>Gratis,</hi> and <hi>G.W.</hi> alſo, (though I never promiſed it to one or other, nor was deſired by either of them to do it) as to anſwer all <hi>G.W</hi>'s ſecond part of the <hi>Quakers Plainneſs,</hi> or at leaſt to <hi>enervate the chief ſinews</hi> of it, only uſing of <hi>George's</hi> own words, <hi>Mutatis Mutandis.</hi> As for example, how ſilly is it for thee <hi>G.W.</hi> to take exceptions againſt the <hi>Title</hi> of his Book (and that was one of the chiefeſt matters of the Charge at the firſt, till the Anabaptiſts had pretty handſomly handled you and beat you off from that, by producing a Book or Books of your own Friends, who writ after the ſame manner;) A DIALOGUE <hi>betwixt a Chriſtian and a Quaker:</hi> why cannot <hi>T. Hicks</hi> tell thee (like as thou thy ſelf art ſo ſilly in thy own caſe to tell him) that <hi>ſuch a Title</hi> was not STRICTLY but FIGU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RATIVELY placed on his Book? and then for all the reſt of his <hi>words,</hi> wherein <hi>W.P.</hi> and thou chargeſt him with <hi>Forging,</hi> and <hi>Forgeries, Slanders</hi> and <hi>Lies</hi>; Thou haſt here taught him a ſhort way to the wood, and ſo may Anſwer thee if he pleaſe, all in few words. <hi>Such Titles, ſuch words or ſayings, are not ſtrictly, but figuratively placed and put down in his Dialogues</hi>: and thus <hi>George</hi> himſelf hath taken the pains to anſwer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute himſelf, and hath with one blaſt of his mouth, blown away thoſe diſmal great charges of <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>Forgeries</hi> laid on his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. Oh! kind-natured Man! But I dare ſay it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his intention, only he could not tell how to clear his Friends otherwiſe (from other Mens charge of <hi>Blaſphemy</hi>) <hi>viz. for preferring their pittiful Pamphlets to the Holy Scriptures</hi>; and <hi>ſo by ſhunning one Rock, he hath ſplit himſelf on another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am of the Opinion that when <hi>T. Hicks</hi> comes to underſtand this, he will ſay that he is as much beholden to <hi>G.W.</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his way ſo eaſie by this one <hi>Sentence</hi> as by any advice twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Friends could give him.</p>
                  <p>Now I would not have any Quaker miſtake me, and ſay I deny <hi>all figures,</hi> for I own that there are ſome <hi>Metaphors</hi> in the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> and that ſome <hi>Parables</hi> are therein written, which muſt <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily</hi> be interpreted <hi>Metaphorically</hi> and <hi>Figuratively</hi>; but this I deny, <hi>that therefore the whole Scripture is a Figure, or all of it to be figuratively interpretted.</hi> This I only hint, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb facs="tcp:109270:24"/>
to prevent the <hi>Quakers</hi> miſtake who when they pleaſe I find will wilfully miſtake others if they think they can make any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by it though never ſo baſe: But this I ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Quakers</hi> have excluded themſelves from uſing of <hi>Figures,</hi> they having ſo long and ſo often witneſſed <hi>that all Figures were ended,</hi> and they were come to the end of all <hi>Figures,</hi> and were come to <hi>Chriſt the Light,</hi> which was the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and the end of all <hi>Figures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That if notwithſtanding the Quakers (in contradiction to themſelves) <hi>will take the Liberty to make uſe of Figures, in their words and writings, and the Interpretation of them,</hi> then they cannot (without groſs injuſtice and impudent partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) deny to others the <hi>ſame</hi> liberty and the <hi>uſe</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> thing they take themſelves, and ſo the matter will hold good all along. The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and 22. <hi>Happy is he that condemneth not himſelf, in that thing which he alloweth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus, Courteous Readers, you ſee, that <hi>G.W.</hi> hath furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ſuch weapons for his Adverſary. That if he will but make uſe of them as he may, he muſt mortally wound the Cauſe of <hi>G.W.</hi> and all the Quakers. And thus <hi>G.W</hi>'s Diſcourſe in ſo many Pages may be effectually enervated in theſe few lines. Now this being ſo, I cannot but foreſee (though I pretend not to be any ſuch <hi>Prophet</hi> as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do) that the <hi>Quaker</hi> will wind and twine, kick and winch, flatter and flutter to extricate himſelf out of this Net and Fetters which he hath ſo (ingeniouſly) caught and lockt himſelf in. But I think now he hath put himſelf there, I ſhall be able to hold the Leviathan, and the more Rope I give him, the leſs danger. (But ſtill I intend to keep him faſt).</p>
                  <p>I cannot but expect there will be great pulling and drawing here by the <hi>Quakers</hi> to <hi>Wiredraw, Draw-in, or draw-back</hi>; theſe words again. Surely ſome curious <hi>mincing and mangling</hi> we muſt expect about this good time; Now ſome new-invented QUAKERS QUIRK or QUIBBLE might ſerve at a dead lift, to <hi>extenuate, divide, diſtinguiſh,</hi> or <hi>extinguiſh</hi> it into <hi>Atomes.</hi> What can they find better now than a <hi>Jeſuitical equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi>? But if they ſerved ſeven years at <hi>Rome</hi> for it, yet 'tis a Queſtion whether it will quit their coſt; for <hi>G.W.</hi> knows (it ſeems) it is a <hi>ſcornful</hi> fellow he hath to deal withal; <hi>that will believe no more of the Quakers pretences than other mens, without</hi> BETTER PROOF. 'Tis ten to one if the more they <hi>flutter,</hi> they do not more <hi>be-fetter</hi> themſelves; they cannot thus <hi>dance in</hi> in a Net, but ſome Body will ſee them, and they are as eaſily ſeen <hi>through</hi> as they boaſt they can ſee <hi>through</hi> others.</p>

                     <p>And now I hope G.W. will not ſay it is <hi>Forgery,</hi> or <hi>Slander,</hi> if they are charged as he relates <hi>p.</hi> 77. <hi>That the Quakers endeavour to Render their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries as Ridiculous as they can, and to make their Friends believe they do nothing but contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> But I have this further to ſay for my ſelf, That if I had indeed committed a <hi>miſtake,</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted</hi> my ſelf, I had that to plead for my excuſe, which G.W. commends me for, <hi>p.</hi> 44. that my opinion is, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>For <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> how palpable is it, in that they pretend they <hi>conſcientiouſly</hi> ſcruple owning in their <hi>Creed,</hi> THAT THE HUMANE NATURE IS THE CHRIST, <hi>becauſe, it is a Deviating from Scripture-Language, and they pretend they find no plain Scripture that ſays ſo</hi>; when yet at the ſame time, they tell you, they have often confeſſed <hi>that the</hi> DIVINE NATURE, or Word as CLOATHED <hi>with the moſt</hi> HOLY MANHOOD— <hi>is and was the Chriſt</hi>; and this they do without <hi>ſcruple</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; <hi>And yet there's no plain Scripture that I know of, that ſays ſo,</hi> yea, and it is a <hi>Deviating</hi> from <hi>Scripture-Language</hi>; for where can they ſhew me this Language in Scripture [CLOATHED WITH THE HOLY MANHOOD,] or ſuch a word there as [MANHOOD,] and until they have done that, I muſt charge them with HIPOCRISY, and their pretended Scruples to be nothing but <hi>pretences</hi> and DECEIT.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As to their <hi>Quibbling,</hi> herein it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that to blind the eyes of the ſimple, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pretend as in <hi>p.</hi> 18. to <hi>own the Holy Manhood to be Chriſt.</hi> And yet <hi>p.</hi> 19. <hi>Deny the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be Chriſt.</hi> By the firſt they would ſeem as if they owned the Humane Nature to be Chriſt, when-as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109270:41"/>
indeed they utterly deny it, as you may ſee by the Latter.</p>
                     <p>But ſince they own, the <hi>Divine Nature Cloathed</hi> with the <hi>moſt Holy Manhood,</hi> and as <hi>having taken Fleſh of the Seed of Abraham, not only was,</hi> but <hi>is</hi> the <hi>Chriſt</hi>; and yet ſay that the <hi>Light which is in every Man is the Chriſt,</hi> I conſidered with my ſelf, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this moſt holy Manhood was in every Man, and the Manhood was the Light in every Man, or a part of that Light?</hi> Taking theſe words in their <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>common</hi> ſignification among us <hi>Engliſh Men,</hi> but ſo I could not find it <hi>conſiſtent</hi> with their Doctrine of the LIGHT WITHIN; and therefore would it not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a pretty <hi>Quibble,</hi> if ſome of them do mean by MANHOOD; not MAN <hi>really,</hi> and <hi>eſſentially, but only a</hi> GARMENT, or a certain <hi>quality,</hi> as <hi>Power, Fortitude,</hi> or <hi>Valour</hi>? So when they confeſs <hi>Chriſt Cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed</hi> with the moſt Holy <hi>Manhood,</hi> they mean <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>Cloathed</hi> with the moſt Holy Power, Valour <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or <hi>Cloathed with a Garment</hi>? Or elſe, if they <hi>deny</hi> this, they muſt <hi>confute</hi> their other <hi>Principle</hi> of the <hi>Light within every Man being the Chriſt,</hi> or ſpeak as <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. And then I further enquire of the Quakers; Whether the moſt Holy <hi>Manhood</hi> be indeed the <hi>Chriſt</hi> or a <hi>real part of Chriſt?</hi> And whether the <hi>Fleſh</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> took of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> (ſince AS SUCH, <hi>G.VV.</hi> ſometimes, <hi>viz. p.</hi> 18. confeſſes he IS the Chriſt) be, or can be the <hi>Chriſt, the Light, or a part of that Light,</hi> which at other times the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay <hi>is in every Man</hi>?

                  <p>Now this of <hi>T.R</hi>'s might be ſuch a <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>ingenious</hi> piece indeed, as it may be a <hi>Boy</hi> of <hi>ten</hi> years old might not, and yet a <hi>Boy</hi> of about <hi>thirty</hi> might <hi>Write</hi>: And I have heard that ſome of <hi>T.R</hi>'s own <hi>Brethren</hi> have lookt upon it, as a very <hi>Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> and <hi>ſilly</hi> thing for him to write ſo about <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> as he did, but that he <hi>deals</hi> ſo much in it; and a <hi>Quaker</hi> may be <hi>Fool-hardy,</hi> as well as others, why not?

                  <p>Let <hi>Thomas Rudyard</hi> compare his Practice of <hi>SUEING</hi> people with <hi>James Naylors</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine [<hi>Poſſeſſion of the Living Faith, p.</hi> 7.] <hi>It was never the Faith of Chriſt to SUE, Contend, &amp;c.</hi> and and <hi>T.R.</hi> may ſee, what an <hi>Hermophrodite-Quaker</hi> himſelf will appear.</p>

Twenty Years, and yet all this while to talk of, or pretend to <hi>INFALLIBILITY,</hi> which hath Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned them (to defend themſelves from thoſe who have taken more notice of their <hi>Inconſtancy, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,</hi> and <hi>Changes</hi> than they were willing ſhould be) to uſe the <hi>greateſt Quibbling,</hi> and <hi>groſſeſt Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations</hi> that have been uſed in <hi>Religious</hi> matters, ever ſince the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> new modell'd the Art, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>hide</hi> it, and themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Some of their moſt Conſiderable <hi>Quibbles</hi> in their Doctrine touching that <hi>Grand Principle</hi> of our true Lord and Saviour <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> I had Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given me by them, to ſet forth more particularly in my Second <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> beginning at p. 29. But my intended Brevity not permitting, and not knowing but that theſe Perſons might learn to be ſomewhat more humble, meek, moderate, and civil, when they ſhould rightly reflect on it and themſelves, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me of proceeding any further therein: Yet ſince I underſtand it is very much deſired by others, and the <hi>Quakers</hi> as much to want it, they being as <hi>Confidently outragious</hi> as before (for in the midſt of all their <hi>Inconſtancies</hi> in their Practice and Doctrines I find them chiefly conſtant in theſe two things in their Practice, <hi>viz. their egregious Confidence,</hi> and their <hi>Railing, Reviling Language</hi> to <hi>others</hi>; and in that it may be truly ſaid of them, <hi>Can the</hi> Ethiophian <hi>change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots</hi>?) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here is ſet forth <hi>more</hi> of their <hi>Quibbles</hi> in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral particulars, and that in ſome moſt weighty and important Points; as thoſe of the <hi>Church, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing,</hi> the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi>; and in other Matters which by the <hi>Quakers</hi> were at firſt made very <hi>weighty</hi> alſo, however now they

                  </p>
                  <p>And if that be <hi>admitted,</hi> neither themſelves nor others can have any <hi>Certainty</hi> in them, or of them, for they may pretend the <hi>Spirit</hi> leads them to <hi>this</hi> to Day, and <hi>that</hi> to Morrow, and to a <hi>third</hi> thing quite different the next Day; and they may ſay (as ſome of them have done) that they had not a clear <hi>Diſcerning</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Voyce</hi> in <hi>this</hi> thing then, nor in <hi>that</hi> thing now; and ſo they may as well pretend ſeven and ſeventeen Years hence, for it depends onely upon their <hi>bare Word</hi> to others; and thus they make their <hi>Religion</hi> as <hi>unconſtant</hi> as the <hi>Moon,</hi> and as <hi>wavering</hi> as the <hi>Wind.</hi> But how all this ſhould be, and yet the <hi>Quakers</hi> all this while pretend to <hi>INFALLIBILITY,</hi> and <hi>That ſuch their Writings and Doctrines were given forth by the Spirit of the Lord in them,</hi> though thus <hi>Contradictory,</hi> is ſuch a <hi>Quibble</hi> and <hi>Riddle,</hi> as would puzzle <hi>Oedipus</hi> himſelf (were he here) to <hi>un-riddle.</hi>

                  <p>Neither I think ſhould I have done thus much, but that I find they are grown of late Years ſo exceſſive <hi>High, Proud, Imperious, Scornful,</hi> and <hi>Harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in a ſtrange kind of <hi>Confidence</hi> and <hi>Quibbling Equivocations,</hi> beyond the bounds of <hi>Modeſty</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that they have need of ſomething to make them <hi>ſenſible,</hi> if it may be, and better to <hi>know</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they may not thus proudly <hi>Deſpiſe, Curſe,</hi> and <hi>Condemn</hi> everlaſtingly <hi>others</hi> that are not of their <hi>Body, Church,</hi> and <hi>Way.</hi>

But as the Perverſions, Scoffs, Quibbles, and Abuſes were the Quakers that my Book ſet forth, and ſo was made up much of, it may be true enough, for I know of no ſuch Perverſions, Quibbles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there, but onely the <hi>Quaker's,</hi> and there was good ſtore of Them.</p>
                  <p>Truly, <hi>Reader,</hi> ſome think the like Letter was hardly ever before ſeen to come from a <hi>Quaker,</hi> &amp; one of their Chieftains too;
<q>He aſſured me <hi>therein,</hi> he was as willing to receive INFORMATION as to give it in any thing wherein any thing ſeemed doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or any miſtake is (or may be) ſuppos'd, about the Controverſies depending between us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereby then he acknowledges, he thought the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was able to give him <hi>Information</hi> (at leaſt) in ſome of thoſe matters in Controverſie, otherwiſe it was ſilly for him to deſire that he might Diſcourſe with the Author to that purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> for <hi>mutual informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as he writ he did.</p>
                  <p>And did not the <hi>Quaker</hi> herein finely vail his Bonnet, that had been talking of, or pretending to INFAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIBILITY nigh theſe Twenty Years (if not above) and yet now in 1674/5. <hi>aſſures the Author</hi> (who yet had told him I pretended no ſuch <hi>Infallibility</hi>) <hi>he was as willing to Receive Information</hi> (by diſcourſing with him) <hi>as to Give it in any thing ſeeming doubtful about

he wrote his <hi>Sandy Foundation</hi>? Beſides, I can free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell <hi>G.W.</hi> I had rather a thouſand times be one of them he calls <hi>Socinians,</hi> than ſuch a <hi>Quaker</hi> as he is. Foraſmuch <hi>as they own ſomewhat REAL in the Lord JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, and own him to be a REAL PERSON WITHO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> But this <hi>Quaker</hi> and others of them, make a meer <hi>PHANTASM</hi> (or <hi>FANCY</hi>) of him or his Body, as their former Preachments and Writings give me to underſtand: And accordingly ſome do not apprehend it any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult thing to make out, that ſome of the grand <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> when they will ſpeak more plainly (whatever at other times they pretend) do, or did own, <hi>no other CHRIST,</hi> than <hi>what</hi> is indeed and Truth either <hi>their own FANCY, SPIRIT,</hi> or <hi>MIND within,</hi> or at beſt, <hi>the dictates of their OWN CONSCIENCE,</hi> or <hi>what</hi> ſome Men commonly call <hi>the Dictates of Conſcience,</hi> or others call <hi>Reaſon, Man</hi>'s <hi>Spirit the Mind within, or the Life of Man,</hi> or cannot be well and truly differenced, diſtinguiſhed, diſcriminated from them.</p>

<q>They own no other Divinity of Chriſt, than what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, or eſſentially within their OWN BODIES: Neither do they in truth and plainneſs own any other DIVINITY of Chriſt, nor any other CHRIST than what's born into the World with them, when they come forth of THEIR Mothers Wombs, or is manifeſt in THAT individual Fleſh of theirs, as their <hi>words</hi> and writings <hi>inform</hi> me:</q> And what a <hi>rare DIVINITY of Chriſt</hi> is this, (think you) that the <hi>Quakers</hi> own?</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Let them <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>poſitively</hi> deny any one of theſe two if they will, and tell us, that what they ſay, is to be taken in the <hi>Grammatical</hi> ſence to avoid <hi>Quibbling Equivocation,</hi> if they dare; and 'tis very probable, you may have a moſt full proof of it, and that from their <hi>own</hi> Mouths or Pens; and therefore when they ſay,
<q>That Geo. Fox is not Christ, <hi>that's but a</hi> Quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>for they mean then by</hi> G. Fox, <hi>ONELY his</hi> Fleſh, <hi>or</hi> Body; <hi>and ſo they do likewiſe ſay,</hi> That the Body of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, or the Body called JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, is not the CHRIST; <hi>and thus no wonder then, if they ſay,</hi> that <hi>Geo.

                     <p>That the <hi>Quakers</hi> muſt mean, that theſe words of <hi>the Apoſtle</hi> are to be taken either <hi>

                     <p>For if they ſay that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> meant thereby, that the manifeſtation of the Spirit which he ſpeaks of, is given to <hi>every one in the world.</hi> Then they at the ſame time grant, <hi>it is given to the Church of</hi> England, to the <hi>Baptiſt Churches,</hi> and <hi>to me</hi> alſo; and if they I ſay, that the manifeſtation of the Spirit is <hi>VISIBLE</hi> to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:109270:120"/>
others, then thereby they grant they have it not <hi>more</hi> than others, nay, are <hi>without it</hi>; becauſe the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> have Cenſured and Condemned <hi>other Churches as being</hi> WITHOUT <hi>it,</hi> and yet <hi>themſelves</hi> can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>viſibly NO MORE</hi> manifeſtation of the Spirit, than <hi>thoſe,</hi> whom they ſay are <hi>without</hi> it.</p>
                     <p>And if they ſay, the manifeſtation of the Spirit is INVISIBLE to others, then at the ſame time, they grant, the <hi>Church of England,</hi> or the <hi>Baptiſt Churches</hi> may have it, though they may not <hi>know</hi> it, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not SEE it, for how ſhould they, if it be INVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIBLE?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. But on the other hand, if they ſay, Theſe words of the Apoſtle are to be taken <hi>Reſtrictively,</hi> that the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given <hi>to every Man in the Churches onely,</hi> (as moſt likely in truth it is, as the word IS in the Preſent Tenſe, and the whole ſcope of the Chapter intimates, the Gifts and manifeſtations of the Spirit he mentions being then <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> and no where elſe that we find, <hi>ſuch as the Gifts of Healing, Tongues,</hi> &amp;c. mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the very next Verſes, as ſome of theſe manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations ſpoken of, in <hi>v.</hi> 7.) Then this of the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Corinths</hi> having the manifeſtation of the Spirit, is no more to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> than to the <hi>POPE OF ROME.</hi> For it will not follow, That becauſe the <hi>Church at Corinth</hi> had the manifeſtation of the Spirit, that the <hi>Quakers Church</hi> muſt NOW have it, nor becauſe THEY SAY they have it; for at that rate, the <hi>Baptist Churches,</hi> and ALL the <hi>Churches in</hi> England might claim it, and who can hinder them?</p>
                     <p>And beſides <hi>G.W.</hi> hath barred himſelf of that, and plainly told us, (in his Glory of Chriſts Light within p. 33.)
<q>That which was to one State, was not to every
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:109270:120"/>
particular State and Condition among the Churches, neither do we read that the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> was to go and make the Epiſtle to the Church at <hi>Rome</hi> their Rule; Nor that the Churches at <hi>Epheſus, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi,</hi> or <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> were to go to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles to them, to compare theirs with, and to be their Rule; but that of the Spirit or Light within, to which they were all directed, and which was the Rule of the New Creature whereby the things of God were Revealed and made known unto the Saints.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now then what does the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s writing to the Church at <hi>Corinth [that the Manifeſtation of the Spirit</hi> was then <hi>given to every Man, to profit withal]</hi> ſignifie to <hi>G.W.</hi> or the <hi>Quakers</hi> here? They are not the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> nor can they produce viſibly <hi>ſuch Manifeſtations</hi> of the Spirit, as they did; Nay, <hi>G.W.</hi> himſelf gives you to underſtand, ſuch viſible ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations were onely peculiar to the Apoſtles times.

                     <p>Now comes <hi>G.VV.</hi> with the Art and Myſtery of <hi>Jeſuitiſm,</hi> and would DIRECT <hi>Fiſher</hi>'s IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TENTION, By asking me thus,
<q>Haſt thou dealt Honeſtly and Truly in this? Was it <hi>S.F</hi>'s. poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Aſſertion concerning the Scriptures THEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELVES, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> Judge, ſerious Reader <hi>(ſays

And then hath the wicked Confidence to call me <hi>Manifeſt Perverter,</hi> yea, and to take the LORDS Name in vain upon it too, ſaying, <hi>Surely the Lord will Rebuke him, and all perverſe Oppoſers and Perverters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What a ſad thing is it to have to do with Men thus <hi>hardned, falſe,</hi> and <hi>impudent,</hi> which I will ſhew to you as <hi>Clear,</hi> as I think it is poſſible, for any words to be <hi>Clear,</hi> in three Particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

                     <q>That they (Quakers) do not <hi>ſay,</hi> nor <hi>viſibly</hi> produce ANY MORE, than the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> Churches, or the pretended Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>G.W.</hi> As in the Name of the Quakers, affirms, <hi>THEY CAN, AND DO,</hi> or to that purpoſe.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>Upon this, I require of him, his Proof, Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or Inſtances: (But as yet cannot obtain them, and ſome thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, this would be <hi>plain,</hi> and is not to trouble Peoples Heads or Minds with long and dubious <hi>Diſputes,</hi> about <hi>nice School-diſtinctions,</hi> nor <hi>abſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſe

Matters</hi>; WHEREFORE if the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> deſign to give any Real and Direct Anſwer to ME, they ought (if they dare to go the <hi>plaineſt</hi> way, and deal honeſtly therein)
<q>To ſet down on <hi>one ſide,</hi> what the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> and <hi>Muggleton</hi> ſay, and can viſibly produce for themſelves; and on <hi>the other ſide</hi> ſet down what they (the <hi>Quakers</hi>) do ſay, and viſibly produce for themſelves.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Work would be ſhort, the <hi>Quakers</hi> need do no more at preſent than this, in <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the Firſt and Second Part of the <hi>Quakers Quibbles</hi>; neither do I deſire any more at preſent of them, thereunto. And this I pray my <hi>Countrey-men</hi> and <hi>them</hi> to take NOTICE, how Reaſonable my Requeſt is, and how I deſire to prevent (that they may have no Colour nor Excuſe for troubling the World and me with) any more of their <hi>Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and ſilly ſcribling,</hi> not at all to the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>If they undertake to make any Anſwer to <hi>Me,</hi> NOTE, that this above is the main thing, and the very MATTER, they muſt <hi>Anſwer</hi> to, or elſe it is not an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to ME, nor to WHAT I have wrote, but an Anſwer to SOMEWHAT elſe, or onely an EVASION.</p>
                  <p>And they cannot, <hi>now</hi> either honeſtly or juſtly refuſe to do this, becauſe <hi>G.W.</hi> hath already <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken</hi> (for them) to give me a <hi>plain Anſwer</hi> to my firſt Treatiſe, (which contains this,) which he hath not yet done, as I have fully ſhew'd in my Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part, <hi>where,</hi> and <hi>how</hi> he falls ſhort. THERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORE that they may not pretend <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>forgetfulneſs,</hi> I do ſignifie it to them ONCE MORE, (Becauſe I would fain <hi>beat</hi> this into their

                     <hi>Heads,</hi> finding they will not yet let it enter their <hi>Crowns,</hi> it conſtrains me to tell it them <hi>over</hi> and <hi>over</hi> again) and do <hi>deſire</hi> him or them that ſhall go about to <hi>write,</hi> to <hi>Read</hi> this, and take NOTICE of it in the <hi>firſt</hi> place.</p>
                  <p>And then when they have honeſtly performed this (that they may not pretend any Excuſe) Let them write what, and as much as they will about any <hi>other Matter</hi> in difference betwixt us, I hope it ſhall find no other than a <hi>kind</hi> Reception with me.</p>
                  <p>THIS any plain Ordinary Man, that hath but the Common uſe of his <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, Eyes,</hi> or <hi>Ears,</hi> may be able to <hi>ſee,</hi> or <hi>bear,</hi> and Judge of, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <q>Whether, and what the <hi>Quakers</hi> do ſay, and viſibly produce MORE than thoſe others (whom <hi>THEY CONDEMN</hi>) do, or can ſay and produce. For <hi>otherwiſe</hi> no Man can certainly, and uncontroulably give and produce any <hi>BET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER</hi> ground for his Faith in Believing a <hi>QUA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KER,</hi> than a <hi>BAPTIST,</hi> or <hi>MUGGLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But I doubt this is too <hi>honeſt</hi> and <hi>plain-hearted</hi> for the <hi>Quakers</hi> ever to do, and ſome think one may as ſoon expect the Great <hi>Turk</hi> to turn <hi>Quaker,</hi> as the <hi>Quaker</hi> to do this; they knowing that this would <hi>touch</hi> them to the <hi>Quick,</hi> and lay them too <hi>open,</hi> however I lay it before them, and leave it with them, that all good and ſober Men may ſee what <hi>Plainneſs, Honeſty, Fidelity,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is in them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I would Adviſe all Perſons, that are, or ſhall be concerned in <hi>Diſpute</hi> with a <hi>Quaker,</hi> to bring
