         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

by some competent number of the better sort,

               <p>
                  <hi>Aristocraties</hi> are of 3. sorts, <hi>viz,</hi> where the <hi>Senators</hi> are

               <p>THe <hi>Popular State</hi> is the Government of a <hi>State</hi> by

In every <hi>Iust State,</hi> some part of the Government is,
or ought to bee imparted to the people; As in a Kingdome,
a voice or sufferage in making Lawes; and sometimes also,
in levying of Armes (if the charge bee great, and the Prince
forced to borrow helpe of his Subjects) the matter right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
may bee propounded to a Parliament, that the taxe may
seeme to have proceeded from themselves. So consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and some proceedings in Judiciall matters may in
part bee referred to them. The reason, least seeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be in no number, nor of reckoning, they mislike the
state or kind of Government: And where the Multitude
is discontented, there must needs bee many Enemies to
the present state. For which cause, Tyrants (which allow
the people, no manner of dealing in State matters) are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to bereave them of their wits and weapons, and all
other meanes, whereby they may resist, or amend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as in <hi>Rusheland, Turkey, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>A <hi>Tyranny</hi> is the swarving, or distorting of a <hi>Monarchy,</hi>
or the Government of one tending not to the publique
good, but the private benefit of himselfe, and his followers.
As in the <hi>Russe</hi> and <hi>Turkish</hi> Government, where the State

uphoulding of the greatnesse of the King, or Emperour.
This is the worst of all the Bastard States, because it is the

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62401:6"/>

               <p>A <hi>Common-wealth</hi> is the swarving or depravation of a

               <p>These two <hi>States,</hi> to wit; The <hi>Oligarchy</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth,</hi>
are very adverse the one to the other, and have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
bickerings and dissentions betweene them. For that
the Richer or Nober sort suppose a right of superiority to
appertaine unto them in every respect, because they are
superiour, but in some respects onely, to wit, in riches, birth,
parentage, &amp;c. On the other side, the Common people sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
there ought to bee an equality in all other things,
and some State matters; because they are equall with the
rich or noble, touching their <hi>Liberty,</hi> whereas indeed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the one nor the other are simply equall or superiour
as touching Government and fitnes thereunto, because
they are such, to wit, because they are Rich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But because they are wise, vertuous valiant &amp;c. and so have
fit parts to governe a State.</p>
               <p>These severall States are sometimes mixed and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought
one with the other, yet ever so, as that the one
hath the preheminent predomination over the other,
as in the humours and complections of the body. So in
the <hi>Roman</hi> State, the people had their <hi>Plaebiscita,</hi> and gave
the sufferage in the election of Magistrates: Yet the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
(as the State stood) for the most part swayed the State,
and bare the chiefe rule. So in the <hi>Venetian</hi> State, the
Duke seemeth to represent a Monarch, and, the Senate to
bee his Councell: Yet the Duke hath no power in State

such effects as tend to the preservation of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>State,</hi> as it is set or founded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>State Mysteries</hi> are of 2. sorts. 1. <hi>Generall:</hi> That per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to all <hi>States;</hi> as first, to provide by all meanes, that the
same degree or part of the Common-wealth doe not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
both in quantity and quality. In quantity as that the
number of the Nobility, or of great persons, be not more
then the <hi>State</hi> or Common-wealth can-beare. In quality,
as that none grow in wealth, liberty, honours, &amp;c. more
then that is meet for that degree; For as in weights, the
heavier weights beare downe the Skale; So in Common-wealths,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62401:9"/>
that part or degree that excelleth the rest in Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Quantity, overswayeth the rest after it, whereof
follow alterations and conversions of <hi>State.</hi> Secondly,
to provide by all meanes, that the middle sort of people
exceed both the extreames (<hi>viz.</hi>) of <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi>
and the Base, Rascall and beggerly sort. For this maketh
the <hi>State</hi> constant and firme, when both the Extreames are
tied together by a middle sort, as it were with a band, as
for any conspiracy of the rich and beggerly sort together,
it is not to bee feared. To these two points, the Particular
<hi>Rules</hi> or <hi>Sophismes</hi> of every Common-wealth are to bee
applied.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Particular:</hi> That serve for preservation of every
Common-wealth in that forme of <hi>State,</hi> wherein it is
setled as in a Kingdome. That the <hi>Nobility</hi> may bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to beare the Government of the <hi>Prince,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
such as have their dwelling in remote places from
the <hi>Princes</hi> eye, it is expedient to call them up at certaine
times to the <hi>Princes</hi> Court under pretence of doing them
honour, or being desirous to see and enjoy their presence;
and to have their children, especially their eldest, to bee
attendant upon the <hi>Prince,</hi> as of speciall favour towards
them and theirs, that so they may bee trained up in duty
and obedience towards the <hi>Prince,</hi> and bee as <hi>Hostages</hi>
for the good behaviour and faithfull dealing of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
especially if they bee of any suspected note. To that
end, serves the <hi>Persian</hi> practize in having a band or traine
of the <hi>Satrapaes</hi> children; and other Nobles to attend the
Court which was well imited by our traine of <hi>Hench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

if they were of the Nobler sort. Againe, sometimes to
borrow smale summes of his Subjects, and to pay them
againe, that hee may after borrow greater summes and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pay: So in an <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> least it decline to a Popular
<hi>State,</hi> they deceive the people with this and the like <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phismes</hi>
(<hi>viz.</hi>) They compell their owne sort, to wit, the
rich men by great penalties to frequent their assemblies

withall to cite thither some few of them (<hi>viz.</hi>) so many
as are easily over-matched by the richer sort, to make a
shew, that they would have the people, or poorer sort par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers

            <div type="part">
               <head>Generall Rules.</head>
               <p>1. THe first and principall Rule of Policy to bee obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in all States is to professe, and practize, and
maintaine the true worship and religion of Almighty God,
prescribed unto us in his word, which is the chiefe end of
all Government. The <hi>Axiom,</hi> that God bee obeyed simply
without exception, though hee command that which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
unreasonable, and absurd to humane Policy, as in the
<hi>Iewes</hi> Common-wealth, That all the men should repaire
yearely to one place to worship God foure times, leaving
none to defend their coast; though being beset with many
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62401:10"/>
Enemies. Not to sow the seventh yeare, but to suffer the
ground to rest untilled without respect or feare of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. To avoid the causes of conversions, whereby States
are overthrowne that are set downe in the title of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions;
For that Common-wealths (as naturall bodies)
are preserved by avoiding that which hurteth the health
and State thereof, and are so cured by contrary Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>
               <p>3. To take heed, that no Magistrate bee created or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
contrary to the Lawes and Policy of that State.
As that in a Senate, there bee not created a perpetuall <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
as <hi>Caesar</hi> in <hi>Rome.</hi> In a Kingdome, that there bee no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
or convention of equall power with the Prince, in
State matters; as in <hi>Poland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. To create such Magistrates as love the State as it is
setled, and take heed of the contrary practize, as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
Popular persons in a Kingdome, or Aristocraty.
And secondly, to advance such as have skill to discerne
what doth preserve, and what hurteth or altereth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
State.</p>
               <p>5. To that end to have certaine Officers to pry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and to observe such as doe not live and behave
<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hemselves in fit sort, agreeable to the present State; but
desire rather to bee under some other forme or kind of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>6. To take heed that Magistracies bee not sold for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
nor bribe in their Offices, which is specially to bee
observed in that Common-wealth which is governed by
a few of the Richer sort: For if the Magistrate gaine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but his Common Fees, the Common sort and such
as want honour take in good part, that they bee not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
and are glad rather that themselves are suffered to
intend private businesse. But if the Magistrate <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uy and
sell matters, the Common people are do<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bly grieved, both
because they are debarred of those preferments and of
that gaine which they see to grow by them, which is the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62401:10"/>
cause that the <hi>Germaine Olygarchies</hi> continue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o firme,
for both they suffer the poorer sort to grow into wealth,
and the Richer sort are by that meanes freed, and secured
from being under the poore.</p>
               <p>7. To take heed that the State as it is setled and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
bee not over strict, nor exceed in his kind; (<hi>viz.</hi>)
That a Kingdome be not too Monarchicall; Nor a Popular
State bee too Popular: For which cause it is good, that the
Magistrates sometimes yeeld of his right touching honour,
and behave themselves familiarly with those that are equall
unto them in other parts, though inferiour for place and
office; And sometimes popularly with the Common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which is the cause that some Common-wealths, though
they bee very simply and unskilfully set; yet continue
firme, because the Magistrates behave themselves wisely,
and with due respect towards the rest that are without
honour; And therefore, some kind of Moderate popularity,
is to bee used in every Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>8. To take heed of small beginnings, and to meet with
them even at the first, as well touching the breaking and
altering of Lawes, as of other Rules which concerne the
continuance of every severall State. For the disease and
alteration of a Common-wealth doth not happen all at
once but growes by degrees, which every Common
wit cannot discerne, but men expert in Policy.</p>
               <p>9. To provide, that that part bee ever the greater in
number and power which favours the State, as now it
stands. This is to bee observed as a very Oracle in all
Common-wealths.</p>
               <p>10. To observe a meane in all the degrees, and to suffer
no part to exceed; or decay overmuch. As first for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erments,
to provide that they bee rather small and short,
then great and long; And if any bee growne to overmuch
greatnesse, to withdraw or diminish some part of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
Where the <hi>Sophismes</hi> are to bee practized (<hi>viz.</hi>)
to doc it by parts and degrees; to doe it by occasion or
colour of Law, and not all at once. And if that way serve
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62401:11"/>
not, to advance some other, of whose vertue and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
wee are fully assured, to as high a degree, or to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
honour: and to bee the friends and followers of him
that excelleth, above that which is meet. As touching
wealth, to provide, that tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of the middle sort (as before
was said) bee more in number; and if any grow high, and
overcharged with wealth, to use the <hi>Sophismes</hi> of a Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
State; (<hi>viz.</hi>) to send him on Emba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

charges and litle honour, &amp;c. To which end the <hi>Edelishi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
served in some Common-wealths.</p>
               <p>11. To suppresse the factions and quarrels of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and to keepe other that are yet free from joyning
with them in their partakings and factions.</p>
               <p>12. To encrease or remit the Common taxes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions,
according to the wealth, or want of the people
and Common-wealth. If the people bee increased in
wealth, the taxes and subsidies may bee increased. If they
bee poore, and their wealth diminish, specially by dearth,
want of traffique, &amp;c. to forbeare taxes and impositions,
or to take litle. Otherwise grudge and discontentments
must needs follow. The <hi>Sophismes</hi> that serve for impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
are these, and other of like sort, to pretend businesse
of great charge, as Warre, building of Ships, making of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
Castles, Fortifications, &amp;c. for the Common defence;
sometimes by Lotteries and like devises, wherein some
part may bee bestowed, the rest reserved for other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences;
but Princely dealing needs no pretences.</p>
               <p>13. To provide that the Discipline and training of
Youth of the better sort bee such as agreeth with that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth:
As that in a Kingdome, the Sonnes of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-men
to bee attendant at the Court, that they may bee
accustomed to obedience towards the Prince: In the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory
State, that the Sonnes of the Senatours bee not idly,
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> over daintily brought up, but well instructed and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
up in learning tongues and Martiall exercise; that
they may bee able to beare that place in the Common-wealth,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62401:11"/>
which their Father held, and contrary wise in a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
State.</p>
               <p>14. To take heed, least their <hi>Sophismes,</hi> or secret pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctizes
for the continuance and maintenance of that State
bee not discovered, least by that means they refuse and
disappoint themselves, but wisely used and with great se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creflie.</p>

               <p>1. <hi>HImselfe; (viz.)</hi> By the tempering and moderation
of the Princes power, and prerogative. For the lesse
and more temperate, their power and state is; the more
firme, and stable is their Kingdome and Government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they seeme to be further off from a Master-like and
Tyrannicall Empire; and lesse unequall in condition to the
next degree; to wit, the Nobility, and so lesse subject to
grudge and envy.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Nobility; (viz.)</hi> By keeping that degree and due
proportion, that neither they exceed not in number more
then the Realme or State can beare, as the <hi>Scottish</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and sometime the <hi>English,</hi> when the Realme was
overcharged with the numbers of Dukes, Earles, and other
Nobles; whereby the Authority of the Prince was ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipsed,
and the Realme troubled with their factions and
ambitions. Nor that any one excell in honour, power
or wealth, as that hee resemble another King within the
Kingdome; as the House of <hi>Lancaster</hi> within this Realme.
To that end not to load any with too much honour or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrement,
because it is hard even for the best and worthiest
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62401:12"/>
Men to beare their greatnesse and high fortune tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
as appeareth by infinite examples in all States. The
<hi>Sophismes</hi> for preventing or reforming this inconvenience,
are to bee used with great caution and wisedome. If any
great person bee to bee abated, not to deale with him by
calumniation, or forged matter, and so to cut him off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
desert, especially if hee bee gratious among the people
after the Machivilian policy, which besides the Injustice, is
an occasion many times of greater danger towards the
Prince. Nor to withdraw their honour all at once, which
maketh a desperate discontentment in the party, and a
commiseration in the people, and so greater love, if hee bee
gratious for his vertue and publique service. Nor to banish
him into forraine Countries, where hee may have opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of practizing with forraine States, whereof great
danger may ensue, as in the Examples of <hi>Coriolanus, Henry</hi>
the fourth, and such like. But to use these, and the like
<hi>Sophismes: (viz.)</hi> To abate their greatnesse by degrees, as
<hi>David, Ioabs, Iustinian, Bellisarius, &amp;c.</hi> To advance some
other Men to as great or greater honour, to shadow or
over-mate the greatnesse of the other. To draw from him
by degrees his friends and followers, by preferrements,
rewards, and other good and lawfull meanes; especially,
to bee provided that these great men bee not employed
in great or powerfull affaires of the Common-wealth,
whereby they may have more oportunity, to sway the
State.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>People: (viz.)</hi> so to order and behave himselfe, that
hee bee loved and reverenced of the people. For that the
Prince need not greatly feare home-conspiracies, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
invasion, if hee bee firmely loved of his owne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
The reason, for that the Rebell can neither hope for
any forces for so great enterprise; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> any refuge being

Prince: But the Common people being once offended
hath cause to feare every moving, both at home and abroad.
This may bee effected by the Prince, if hee use meanes and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62401:12"/>
art of getting the favour of the people, and avoid those
things that breed hatred and contempt: (<hi>viz.</hi>) if hee s<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>utor, or a Father to love the people and to protect
them, if hee maintaine the Peace of his Kingdome; For
that nothing is more Popular, nor more pleasing to the
people then is peace.</p>
               <p>4. If hee shew himselfe oftentimes gratiously, yet
with State, and Majesty to his people, and receive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of his suppliants, and such like.</p>
               <p>5. If hee sit himselfe sometimes in open Courts and

                  </gap> of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
among his people. If hee bestow many benefits and
graces upon that City which hee maketh the seat of his
Empire, and so make it sure and faithfull unto him, which
is fit to bee in the middle of his Kingdome, as the heart
in the middle of the body, or the Sunne in the middle of
Heaven, both to divide himselfe more easily into all the
parts of his Dominions; and least the furthest parts at one
end move, whilest the Prince is in the other. If hee goe

               <p>14. To make specially choyce of good and sound men
to beare the place of Magistrates, especiall of such as assist
the Prince in his Councels, and Policies, and not to leane
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62401:13"/>
overmuch to his owne advise, contrary to the rule of
Machivill, who teacheth that a Prince can have no good
Councell except it bee in himselfe; his reason, because if hee
use the Councell of some one; hee is in danger to bee
overwrought and supplanted by him: And if hee Councell
with more, then hee shall bee distracted with the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
in opinion. As if a Prince of great, or meane wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
could not take the judgement of all his Counsellours
in any point of Policy, or of so many as himselfe thinketh
good, and to take it either by word or in wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mature deliberation make choice of the best, without any
destraction or binding himselfe to the direction of one.
For the Proverbe is true, that two eyes see more then one;
and therefore, the advises and consultations of a Senatory
State is compared by some to a feast, or dinner, where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
contribute towards the <hi>Shot,</hi> by which meanes they
have more variety of dishes, and so better fare: And yet
every man may make choice of that dish that serveth him
best for his health and appetite.</p>
               <p>15. The Prince himselfe is to sit sometimes in place of
publique justice, and to give an experiment of his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and equity, whereby great reverence and estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is gotten, as in the example of <hi>Solomen;</hi> which may
seeme the reason, why our Kings of <hi>England</hi> had their
Kings bench in place of publique Iustice, after the manner
of the ancient Kings that sate in the Gate; where for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
performing of this Princely duty, some speciall causes
may bee selected, which may throughly bee debated and
considered upon by the Prince in private, with the helpe
and advise of his learned Counsell, and so bee decided pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely,
as before is said, by the Prince himselfe; At least
the Prince is to take accompt of every Minister of publique
Iustice, that it may bee knowne, that hee hath a care of
Iustice, and doing right to his people, which makes the
Iusticers also to bee more carefull in performing of their d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

16. To bee moderate in his taxes, and impositions; and
when need doth require to use the Subjects purse, to doe
it by Parliaments, and with their consents, making the
cause apparant unto them, and shewing his unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in charging them. Finally, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o to use it, that it may
seeme rather an offer from his Subjects, then an exaction by
him.</p>
               <p>17. To stop small beginnings, unto this end to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the dissentious that arise amongst the Nobles, with
Caution that such as are free, bee not drawne into parts,
whereby many times the Prince is endangered, and the
whole Common-wealth set in a combustion; as in the
example of the Barons Warres, and the late Warres of
<hi>France,</hi> which grew from a quarrell betwixt the <hi>Guision</hi>
faction and the other Nobility.</p>
               <p>18. To stirre up the people, if they grow secure and
negligent of armour and other provision for the Common-wealth,
by some rumour or feare of danger at-home, to
make them more ready when occasion requireth. But
this seldome to bee used least it bee supposed a false Alarme,
when there is need indeed.</p>
               <p>19. To have speciall care, that his children, especially
the heire apparent, have such bringing up as is meet for a
King (<hi>viz.</hi>) in learning, specially of matters pertaining to
State, and in Marshall exercise, contrary to the practize of
many Princes, who suffer their children to bee brought

not accustomed to their owne liberty, wherein specially
is to bee observed, that the lawes and customes of that

                  </gap>d, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent:
The like is to bee said, of murthering the natives,
or the greatest part of them, to the end hee may hold the
rest in sure possession. A thing not onely against Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion: but inhumane Iustice, cruell, and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
               <p>2. The safest way is, (supposing a right) that some good
part of the Natives bee transplanted into some other place,
and our Colonies consisting of so many as shall bee thought
meet be planted there in some part of the Province, Castles,
Forts, and Havens, seised upon, and more provided in fit
places, as the manner was of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarch
which transplanted 10. tribes of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> And of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
in <hi>France, Germany, Britany,</hi> and other places. The
reason: 1. For that otherwise forces of horse and foote, are
to bee maintained within the Province which cannot bee
done without great charge. 2. For that the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
is troubled and grieved, with removing and supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62401:15"/>
the Army with victuals, carriages, &amp;c. 3. For that
Collonies are more sure and faithfull then the rest. As for
the Natives that are removed from their former seates,
they have no meanes to hurt, and the rest of the Natives
being free from the inconvenience, and fearing that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
may bee so served, if they attempt any thing rashly,
are content to bee quiet. The Turkes practize in <hi>Asia,</hi>
where the chiefe grounds and dwellings are possessed by
the Souldiours, whom they call <hi>Timariotae.</hi> That the Prince
have his seat and his residence in his new purchase, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for a time, till things bee well setled; especially if the
Province bee great and large, as the <hi>Turke</hi> in <hi>Greece.</hi> The
reasons: 1. Because the presence of the Prince availeth
much to keepe things in order, and get the good will of
his new Subjects. 2. They conceive that they have ref<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ge
by the Princes presence, if they bee oppressed by the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants
and inferiour Governours: Where it will bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for the winning the peoples hearts, that some
examples bee made of punishing of such as have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any violence or oppression. 3. Because being present
hee seeth and heareth what is thought and attempted; and
so may quickly give remedy to it, which being absent, hee
cannot doe, or not doe in time.</p>
               <p>3. If the Prince himselfe cannot bee present to reside,
then, to take heed that the charge of Governing, on new
purchases bee committed to such as bee sure men, and of
other meet quality, that depend wholly upon the Princes
favour; And not to Natives, or other of their owne Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
that are gratious there for their Nobility, or vertue;
especially if the Province bee great, and somewhat farre
distant, which may soone seduce the unsetled affections of
those new Subjects. As for such Governours as depend
wholly upon the Princes favour being not bor<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, but crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Noble, they will not so easily suffer themselves to bee
wonne from their du<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y; and in case they would revolt,
yet they are not able to make any great strength, for
that the people obey them but as Instruments and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62401:15"/>
to keepe them in subjection, and not for any good
will.</p>
               <p>4. To have the children of the chiefe Noble men, and
of greatest authority, Hostages with them in safe keeping;
the more the better: For that no Bound is stronger, then that
of Nature to containe the Parents and Allies in obedience,
and they the rest.</p>
               <p>5. To alter the Lawes, but by degrees one after another,
and to make other that are more behovefull for the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
of the present Government.</p>
               <p>6. To keepe the people quiet and peaceable and well
affected so much as may bee, that they may seeme, by being
conquered, to have gotten a Protectour, rather then a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;
For the Common-people if they enjoy peace, and bee
not distracted, nor drawne from their businesse, nor exacted
upon beyond measure are easily contained under obedience<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Yet notwithstanding, they are to bee dis-used from the
practise of Armes, and other Exercises which encrease con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and bee weakened of Armour, that they have neither
Spirit nor will to rebell.</p>
               <p>7. If there bee any faction in the Countrey, to take
to him the defence of the better, and stronger part, and to
combine with it, as <hi>Caesar</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. To looke well to the Borders and confining Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
and if any rule there of great, or equall power to
himselfe, to joyne league with some other Borderers,
though of lesse strength to hinder the attempts (if any
should bee) by such Neighbour Prince. For it happeneth
often, that a Countrey insested by one Neighbour Prince
calleth in another of as great or greater power to assist,
and rescue it from the other that invadeth it; So the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>

they may prevent all attempts, and take away such as mislike
their State.</p>
               <p>8. To make Schisme and Division among his Subjects,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) To set one Noble man against another, and one
Rich man against another, that through faction and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
among themselves, they may bee weakened,
and attempt nothing against him; and by this meanes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
whisperings and complaints, hee may know
the secrets of both parts, and have matter against them both,

Parasites, and other base and servile fellowes, not too wise,
but yet subtill, that will bee ready for reward to doe and
execute what hee commandeth, though never so wicked
and unjust. For that good men cannot flatter, and wise

               <p>All these practises and such like, may bee contracted

               <p>1. TO make a shew of a good King by observing a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and mediocrity in his Government, and whole
course of life; to which end it is necessary, that this subtill
Tyrant bee a cunning Polititian, or a Machivilian at the

him more to bee feared and regarded, and is thought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

               <p>2. To make shew not of severity, but of gravity, by
seeming reverent, and not terrible in his speech, and gesture,
habite, and other demeanour.</p>
               <p>3. To pretend care of the Common-wealth; and to that
end to seeme loath to exact Tributes and other charges;
and yet to make necessity of it, where none is, To that end
to procure such Warre as can bring no danger towards his
State, and that might easily bee compounded, or some other
chargeable businesse; and to continue it on, that hee may
continue his exaction and contribution so long as hee list.
And thereof to employ some part in his publique service,
the rest to hoord up in his Treasury, which is sometimes
practised even by lawfull Princes; as <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth
in his Warres against. <hi>France,</hi> when having levied a great
summe of money throughout his Realme, especially of the
<hi>Londoners,</hi> hee went over Seas, and returned without any

               <p>4. Sometimes to give an accompt by open speech and
publique writing of the expense of such taxes and imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as hee hath received of his Subjects, that hee may
so seeme to bee a good Husband, and frugall, and not a
Robber of the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>5. To that end, to bestow some cost upon publique Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings;

upon the Ports, Forts, and chiefe Cities of his

a delight in the adorning of his Countrey, or doing some
good for it.</p>

love, and give oportunity to conferre together of
publique matters, under pretence of sparing cost for better
uses. To that end, the Curfieu bell was first ordained by
<hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour</hi> to give men warning to repaire
home at a certaine houre.</p>
               <p>7. To take heed, that no one grow to bee over great,
but rather many-equall great, that they may envy and
contend one with another; and if hee resolve to weaken
any of this sort, to doe it warily and by degrees, If quite
to wrack him and to have his life, yet to give him a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
triall after the manner of his Countrey; And if hee
proceed so farre with any of great power and estimation
as to doe him contumely or disgrace, not to suffer him to
escape, because contumely and disgrace are things contrary
unto Honour, which great Spirits doe most desire, and so
are moved rather to a revenge for their disgrace, then to
any thankfulnesse, or acknowledging the Princes favour
for their pardon or dismission; True in <hi>Athiests,</hi> but not in

               <p>8. To unarme his people, and store up their weapons

such and so many as hee shall thinke meet, and to commit

               <p>9. To make scisme or division under hand among his

set one Rich man against another, that they combine not

And when hee hath effected what hee would by them, if
hee see his people discontented withall, to make them a
Sacrifice to pacifie his Subjects.</p>
               <p>14. To pretend great cure of Religion and of serving
of God, (which hath beene the manner of the wickedest
Tyrants) for that people doe lesse feare any hurt from those,
whom they thinke vertuous and religious, nor attempt
lightely to doe them hurt, for that they thinke that God
protects them.</p>
               <p>15. To have a strong and sure Guard of forraine Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours,

               <p>5. To have speciall care of instructing their Children
in liberall Arts, Policy, and Warlike Exercise, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
good order and discipline. For as Popular States are
preserved by the frequency and liberty of the people, so
this Government of the richer is preserved by discipline

               <p>6. To provide good store of Warlike furniture, especially

               <p>9. In some things which concerne not the points and

to give an equality, or sometimes a preferment to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-people,
and not to doe, as in some <hi>Olygarchies</hi> they

of State, creating of Magistrates, publique Justice,
and Exercise of armes, to practise the contrary to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

are to bee spared, and not to be forced, by fine, or otherwise,

               <p>3. To elect Magistrates from among the Commons, by
Lot, or Ballating, and not to choose any for their wealths
sake.</p>
               <p>4. To take heed, that no man beare office twice, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it bee Military, where the pay, and salery, &amp;c. is to

               <p>5. That no Magistracy bee perpetuall, but as short,

as may bee, to wit, for a yeare, halfe yeare, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>6. To compell Magistrates, when their time expireth

have some aptnes to performe that duty.</p>
               <p>9. To provide that publique Iudgements and Trials, bee
not frequent; and to that end to inflict great fines and other
punishments upon Pettifoggers and Dilatours, as the
law of requitall; &amp;c. Because for the most part the richer
and nobler, and not the Commons are indited and accused
in this Common-wealth, which causeth the rich to conspire
against the State; whereby, many times, the Popular State
is turned into an <hi>Olygarchy,</hi> or some other Government.

like a purse or barrell without a bottom. But to provide,
that a sufficient part of the revenue bee stored up for the

               <p>11. If the number of the poore encrease too much in this
kind of State, to send some abroad out of the Cities into
the next Country places, and to provide, above all, that none
doe live idly, but bee set to their trades. To this end, to
provide that the richer men place in their Farmes and
Coppiholds, such decayed Citizens.</p>
               <p>12. To bee well advised what is good for this State, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62401:21"/>
not to suppose that to bee fit for a Popular State, that
seemeth most popular; but that which is best for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
thereof. And to that end, not to lay into the
Exchequer, or Common Treasury, such goods as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscate,
but to store them up as holy and consecrate things,
which except it bee practised, confiscations, and fines of the

infirmity, and to what end shee was married unto him;
who if shee did it for the Common good, and for duties
