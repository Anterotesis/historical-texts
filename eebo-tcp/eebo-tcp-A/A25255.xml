            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough the State of <hi>Venice</hi> is at this day in its declenſion, yet in the condition it is, it retains ſomthing of Majeſty; It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable for an Antiquity of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Twelve hundred years; Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious for Chriſtianity which it has profeſſed from its Cradle; Famous for the Kingdoms it poſſeſs'd in the <hi>Levant,</hi> and for the Wars it has maintain'd againſt the <hi>Turks;</hi> Famous for the form of its Government, which is a Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of Policy; and Famous for its ancient Allyance with the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> which has had it ſomtimes for its Companion both in Arms and Victories. I have thought, Sir, theſe Reaſons a ſufficient recommendation to your Lordſhip, of this Hiſtory which I now preſent. I am ſenſible notwithſtanding, I ought not to expoſe ſo poor a Work to the Eyes of ſo great a Miniſter, and that a perſon reſpected by all
<pb facs="tcp:50981:3"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> conſecrated to the Publick, ought not to be interrupted by particular Affairs; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I could not but ballance betwixt my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of doing ſomthing that might teſtify my Zeal to your Lordſhips ſervice, and my fear of committing that which might be interpreted boldneſs. But when I conſider'd your Goodneſs, as great as your Power, I could not but hope your Lordſhip would extend the effects of it to me, who along time have been a ſilent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of your Vertues: Vertues that your Lordſhip has inherited from your Father by way of advance; Vertues, that have render'd you like him, a compleat Miniſter.</p>
            <p>I could not but admire in your Lordſhip, that pregnancy and force of Spirit that makes you ſufficient alone for ſo many different affairs, whilſt neither their difficulty diſturbs you, nor their multitude confounds you. That faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unintereſted Devotion you carry for your Prince, (whom you honor more for his Perſon than his Crown) That reſpectful liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wherewith you addreſs to himſelf, not to his fortune; preſerving by a great and unuſual ſecret, the Dignity of your Office, and the Reputation of his Favour; That Heroick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy that places you above the reach of Envy or Hatred, things wherewith you fear not to incumber your ſelf, when the ſervice of your Prince and Countrey requires it; And laſt of all, That incomparable Vigilance that keeps you always in action, which carries you to all
<pb facs="tcp:50981:3"/>
places where your preſence is neceſſary, and which inables you to ſee, to underſtand, and to penetrate into all things. For, if we may truſt what is ſaid and known of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip upon the Frontiers, and in our Armies, There it is Sir, that you are obſerv'd to paſs whole nights on Horſeback, to expoſe your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to danger, perform all the moſt laborious offices of a Soldier, to give example to others, and neceſſitate them to the execution of their Duty. So that Sir, 'tis not without good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon his Majeſty loves you, and heaps upon you his favours and benefits. He does honor to his own Juſtice in advancing of you, and you are the Workman-ſhip rather of his Wiſdom, than Kindneſs. He wanted a ſagacious, exact, active, indefatigable Miniſter, and ſuch a one as was fit to ſucceed in the place of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable Father: He has found all thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications in ſuch perfection in you, that he has put your induſtry upon tryal in ſeveral dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Imployments. His choice diſcovers your worth, and your actions, that you are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his Choice: He is happy in a Miniſter, your Lordſhip in a Maſter; and betwixt His Majeſty and your Lordſhip, we may ſee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Concert that was formerly betwixt <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> and <hi>Mecenas,</hi> that is, a perpetual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict betwixt Generoſity in the Prince, and Gratitude in the Subject. I perceive I am flown out inſenſibly in your praiſes, which flow in upon my Pen without any labour or ſtudy; but
<pb facs="tcp:50981:4"/>
though they proceed from a true Sentiment, and Flattery has no ſhare in them, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs becauſe I would not offend your Lordſhip's modeſty too much, I ferbear to purſue them.</p>
            <p>It remains them that I only beſeech your Lordſhip to vouchſafe your protection to this Work in which you will ſee as in a Glaſs, the fineſt and moſt delicate <hi>Maxims</hi> of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi> I could wiſh it had been more perfect, but I hope you will excuſe its defects, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps commend the deſign, which was the more difficult, becauſe <hi>Venice</hi> is a place where Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets are impenetrable to Strangers, eſpecially to Embaſsadors and other Miniſters, to whom they never ſpeak but by geſtures and ſigns. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſcarce any thing is to be ſeen in their Government, but clouded with variety of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances and pretences far enough from the Truth. For my part, I have endeavour'd to tell truth quite through my Book, and your Lordſhip will eaſily diſcern it; Your Lordſhip who your ſelf uſe it ſo much, and can ſo readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſh it from Falſhood. In the mean time, I ſhall eſteem my ſelf tranſcendently happy, if this Work (which is the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of my thought and my ſolitude) may aſſiſt to perſwade Your Lordſhip that I am with all poſſible Reverence and Devotion.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>

               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Suppoſe by the very Title of my Book, my deſign will be ſo clear, that I need not ſay it was not to write a compleat Hiſtory of <hi>Venice,</hi> which would have been ſuperfluous after ſo many as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and from ſuch eminent Authors; My intention is only to give a ſhort and faithful Relation of their <hi>Policy, Counſels, Magiſtrates,</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> a thing that few have hitherto attempted, and thoſe that have, have done it but ſuperficially. So that if the Subject be not, I may ſay without Arrogance, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of my Deſcription is new; And yet that is not the only thing I pretend ſhall recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it, the goodneſs of my Materials and Authority may do as well, which were the <hi>Letters, Memoires,</hi> and Relation of <hi>Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors</hi> communicated to me; The ancient <hi>Annals</hi> of this <hi>Republick</hi> out of which I have extracted all the Examples and Actions that I report, eſpecially the inſtructions which I had opportunity to take from the Fountain it ſelf, having had the honor to be imploy'd
<pb facs="tcp:50981:5"/>
in the <hi>French Embaſſy</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> which is the true reaſon why I undertook this Work, that otherwiſe would not have fallen into my thoughts. I do not doubt but <hi>Criticks</hi> will find many faults, ſome in my Deſign, ſome in my Language, ſome in my Judgment, and ſome in my Arguments. Let them judg of it as they pleaſe, I ſhould have enough to do to anſwer them, and be ſure to loſe my Cauſe, ſhould I contend with a people who profeſs to deſpiſe and decry every thing that they write not themſelves. I ſhall only ſay to <note place="margin">calvum in tellexiſſe quid melius eſſet, nec voluntatem quin: ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus &amp; Cultius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceret, ſed ingenium ac vires defuiſſe.</note> them as <hi>Quintilian</hi> did of <hi>Calvus,</hi> That my mind was to have done better, but my parts and faculties would not anſwer to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my Deſire; My comfort is, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt <hi>Frenchman</hi> who has writ of this <hi>Government,</hi> I may hope that reaſonable perſons will excuſe my Work the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, becauſe the firſt of every thing is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and it holds in the operations of the mind, as well as the productions of Nature. Beſides, who knows but the roughneſs and unevenneſs of this Book, may provoke ſome more able and dextrous Pen, to exhibit what ſhall be more regular and exact.</p>
            <p>However, the chief object of my Pains, and the only recompence I expect, being your Approbation, I hope you will allow me ſome little time to recount the order and connexion of this <hi>Hiſtory</hi> which I preſent to your peruſal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50981:5"/>
I have begun my Deſcription with the <hi>Grand Council,</hi> which in my own opinion is the unpleaſanteſt part of the Book. This Method will make ſome people ſay (and methinks I hear them already) that I am ill skill'd in the Art of Writing, to bring the Reader at firſt daſh among Briars and Thorns, whereas I ſhould rather have diſplay'd my Roſes and Flowers, to have invited him farther, and inveigled him into an eſteem of it. To this I anſwer, The <hi>Grand Council</hi> being the ſource of all the other <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> I could not proceed otherwiſe without being prepoſterous, and perverting the natural order of my Subject.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if the matter be thorny in it ſelf, it ought not to be imputed to me, who had not the liberty of my choice. And if it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that I might have omitted the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities of their <hi>Elections</hi> and <hi>Ballotings</hi> in the <hi>Grand Council:</hi> I reply, what I have done was no more than neceſſary to make my VVork compleat, and to ſatisfie the curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Reader. For as <hi>Frenchmen</hi> have in their paſſage through <hi>Venice,</hi> many times deſir'd to be admitted into the <hi>Grand Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> to ſee their way of <hi>Balloting,</hi> ſo I doubt not but there are ſome of them will be glad to read, what they have ſeen but confus'dly, and perhaps will commend the pains I have taken to clear them. In which I have imitated ſeveral great Authors, who have vouchſaf'd
<pb facs="tcp:50981:6"/>
us whole volumes for explication of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitia</hi> in the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome;</hi> whereas I have comprehended all <hi>Venetian</hi> Courts in three or four pages, that to read them might not be troubleſom. But in ſhort, if that place diſpleaſes any one, he may without much trouble skip it over, and paſs to that which is more delightful.</p>
            <p>I have treated at large of the <hi>Senat,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being the Nobleſt, and moſt excellent part of the <hi>State,</hi> I thought it but reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to proportion it to its Subject, and make it the chief part of my Book: On the contrary, I have not detain'd my ſelf long upon the <hi>Colledg,</hi> becauſe I look'd upon it as it were an Antichamber to the <hi>Senat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having ſpoken of their <hi>Councils</hi> in General, I proceed to the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of which it is Compos'd, beginning with the <hi>Duke</hi> as chief, and continuing with the reſt according to the dignity and importance of their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I have given ſome little particular touches of the <hi>Doge,</hi> the <hi>Procurators</hi> of <hi>Saint Mark,</hi> and the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> called by them the <hi>Council of Ten.</hi> Not ſo much becauſe they are the Chief <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of the <hi>Town,</hi> as becauſe the Matter, however curious and delightful, has not hitherto been well hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>All that have given us Relations of <hi>Venice,</hi> tell us, that the <hi>Duke</hi> has no more Authority than another <hi>Senator,</hi> and that he is ſubject
<pb facs="tcp:50981:6"/>
to the Laws. That the <hi>Council of Ten</hi> is a great <hi>Tribunal,</hi> where all the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and Malefactors againſt the State, are judged in an extraordinary way: This every body knows before, and there needs no more Books to convince us. But to ſhow how the <hi>Venetians</hi> comport with their <hi>Duke;</hi> in what his Grandeur, his Office, his Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions conſiſt; of what Age, of what Humour, of what Genius he ought to be, are things which in my judgment deſerve to be writ, as compleating our knowledg of their <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> For the ſame reaſon I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to draw the <hi>Council of Ten</hi> to the life, ſuppoſing my draft may be the more grateful, becauſe in it you may ſee all the fine ſtrokes, all the ſubtil Maxims, all the cloſe and conceal'd Myſteries of their <hi>Government.</hi> And I do not fear that any will accuſe me of animoſity or bitterneſs againſt <note place="margin">Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana. Tac. Ar.</note> the <hi>Venetians</hi> (whom I have no reaſon to hate) ſeeing I have ſaid nothing on them but from every good <hi>Memoires,</hi> their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> ſeveral <hi>Embaſsadors,</hi> and the Publick reputation, which certainty will be enough to juſtifie mine. Moreover the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of Venice,</hi> like other Nations, being made up of good and bad, I have not ſuppreſs'd or leſſen'd the honour of their Actions where they accur'd in my Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>If I have compar'd ſomtimes the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of <hi>Venice</hi> to the Magiſtrates of <hi>Sparta,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50981:7"/>
and <hi>Rome,</hi> it was not by the way of Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to my Hiſtory (which perhaps may be wanting) but to ſhow what the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> has taken from two other eminent <hi>Commonwealths,</hi> and with what good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs they have uſued it; an Argument of their profound Wiſdom and Prudence: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, theſe ſort of compariſons inſtruct, and entertain the mind of the Reader, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if he be <hi>French,</hi> whoſe humour it is to learn many things at a time. Moreover in that I have imitated an excellent Hiſtorian, <note place="margin">Polybius.</note> who in the ſame manner has made Parallels betwixt the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> and betwixt theſe and other Nations, but with this difference, that his Deſcription contains whole Pages, and mine (except my compariſon of the <hi>Doge</hi> with the <hi>King of Sparta,</hi> and the <hi>Ephori</hi> with the <hi>Council of Ten)</hi> is compriz'd in three words.</p>
            <p>My language is neither affected, nor care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, but betwixt both, neither great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint on the one ſide, nor great liberty on the other. And if I have not pick'd my words in ſome places, it has been to preſerve the efficacy of the Senſe, which elegant and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Phraſes would not have render'd ſo entire; for I have more reſpect to a good thought, than a good word, to the elegancy of things than the elegance of phraſes, which is the proper work of a Grammarian. Again, A ſubject like mine, requires more gravity and
<pb facs="tcp:50981:7"/>
ſolidity, than polliſh and ſmartneſs; And therefore the <hi>Venetians</hi> deride thoſe who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to ſpeak in their <hi>Senat,</hi> either in the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Dialect. Moreover I ſhould be very glad, and think I came off very well, if nothing be laid to my charge but ill Choice, or ill placing of my words.</p>
            <p>This is all, kind Reader, I have to ſay for my ſelf, and my hope is, your Moderation will make it more effectual, than it would otherwiſe be.</p>

            <p>I Write the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> without contradiction, in its kind, the beſt in all <hi>Europe;</hi> as being a true Copy of the ancient <hi>Republicks</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> and as it were an Amaſs, or Collection of all their moſt excellent Laws. Some Authors have handled this Subject before me, among which Cardinal <hi>Contarin, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſovin,</hi> and <hi>Jannotti</hi> were the chief. But all three of them have given us no more than a bare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Tribunals</hi> in <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice;</hi> and ſo far have they been from ſounding the myſtery of that <hi>Government,</hi> that they would not ſo much as touch it by the by, in reſpect of ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intereſts of their own. Wherefore I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this Relation, out of an opinion it may ſatisfy ſober men by the importance and variety of its matter, in which ſomething poſſibly may be found, that being new will have at leaſt its novelty to recommend it.</p>
            <p>To begin with Order, It ſeems to me convenient to premiſe ſomething about the ſeveral States and Conditions through which this <hi>Republick</hi> has paſt ſince its Foundation; which will be, as it were, an <hi>Epitome</hi> of the whole <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and ſerve as a Scheme or Ground-plot to my Work.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50981:11"/>
conſiderable Families, who were excluded either totally or in part; for ſeveral of them were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided betwixt ſervitude and liberty: witneſs the <hi>Nani,</hi> the <hi>Navagiers,</hi> the <hi>Treviſans,</hi> and the <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualiques,</hi> who in conſequence of this Decree found their Families mingled with the People and the <hi>Nobles,</hi> with Maſters and Servants; upon which the <hi>Quirins</hi> did eagerly complain, That this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation cut the knot of Amity and Concord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt all the great Families in <hi>Venice,</hi> and would endanger the kindling a Civil War.

            <p>In the mean time the new Government, that was as yet but an <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> grew up by degrees to an abſolute <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy</hi> in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks.</note>

Her <hi>Virility</hi> began under the <hi>Nobles</hi> 1298, and laſted from the reformation of the <hi>Government,</hi> which they called, <hi>Il ſerrar di Conſiglio,</hi> where the <hi>Democracy</hi> ended, till the war of the League of <hi>Cambray</hi> 1509, which, to ſpeak properly, was the beginning of her <hi>Old-age.</hi> Be it how it will, <hi>Venice</hi> has this advantage, ſhe has main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd her ſelf longer than all the famous <hi>Republicks</hi> of the <hi>Ancients.</hi> The <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>Sparta</hi> laſted but 700 years: <hi>Athens, Thebes,</hi> and <hi>Rhodes</hi> loſt their liberty ſeveral times: <hi>Corinth</hi> continued not long in that form: and <hi>Rome,</hi> the moſt illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of them all, had much ado to preſerve it ſelf free 500 years together; a ſtrong preſumption of the excellence of the <hi>Venetian Common-wealth,</hi> whoſe preſent State and Condition is the only thing I deſign to repreſent in this Book.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>three</hi> principal <hi>Councils</hi> in <hi>Venice;</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Grand Council,</hi> which comprehends the whole body of the <hi>Nobles:</hi> the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> which is the <hi>Senate;</hi> and the <hi>Colledg</hi> where <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> have their audience. I do not reckon among them the <hi>Council of Ten,</hi> becauſe it is only a Tribunal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for the trial of matters againſt the State. In all theſe Councils the <hi>Seigniory</hi> (which is a kind of <hi>Septemvirate,</hi> conſiſting of the <hi>Duke</hi> and ſix <hi>Councellors,</hi> and called <hi>il Conſiglietto,</hi> being an

            <p>But the <hi>Grand Council</hi> being the <hi>baſis</hi> and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this <hi>Republick;</hi> it ſeems to me moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to begin my deſcription with a particular of that, its Juriſdiction, and all its Eſſential parts: which I ſhall endeavour to do with as much me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, clearneſs and brevity, as is poſſible.</p>

                  <p>In <hi>Summer-time</hi> the <hi>Grand Council</hi> meets in the morning, and ſits from eight of the clock till noon.

                  <p>Their Election of <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> is in this manner.

The Electors (who are always 36, and make four <hi>Mains</hi> as they call them, or ſeparate
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50981:13"/>
Bands) do each of them name a Competitor, which is baloted afterwards by one <hi>Main</hi> of the Electors.</p>
                  <p>To underſtand it the better, you muſt know there are three <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rns</hi> raiſed above the ordinary height of a man, to the end that no body might look into them. One of theſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rns</hi> is placed before the <hi>Duke,</hi> the other two at the ends of the Table; and three Councellors are appointed to look to each of them.</p>
                  <p>Into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rns</hi> on the right and left hand are put as many little white Bouls as there are <hi>Nobles</hi> in the Council; that is to ſay, ſixty all gilt, thirty for each <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn.</hi> Into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn</hi> in the middle are put ſixty, 36 gilt, and 24 white. The <hi>Nobles</hi> come up two by two, one on each ſide, and draw by turns: If the Boul be white, they throw it into a little box under the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn,</hi> and return to their place as nothing had been done. If the Bowl be gilt, it is preſented to the Councellors belonging to the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn</hi> out of which it was taken. From thence they proceed to the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn</hi> in the middle, out of which, if they draw a white Bowl, they are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excluded; but if it be their fortune to light upon a gilt Bowl, they are received for Electors of the firſt <hi>Main:</hi> after which they remove to a Bench placed before the <hi>Duke</hi>'s Throne, where they ſit down with their faces towards the <hi>Duke,</hi> that no man may have opportunity by making ſigns to recommend himſelf to them; and having done this, they are proclaim'd aloud by one of the Secretaries of the Council. If in the firſt <hi>Main</hi> the lot falls to two <hi>Nobles</hi> of the ſame Family, the ſecond is reſerv'd for the ſecond <hi>Main;</hi> and all the Gentlemen of that Houſe retire out of the Council, the Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding them that day, becauſe there cannot be in the thirty ſix above two Electors of one Family; So that every <hi>Main</hi> conſiſts of nine Gentlemen of indifferent Families.</p>

                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:50981:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The firſt <hi>Main</hi> being fix'd, a Secretary delivers to the youngeſt of them a Note of what Offices are to be ſupplied, and conducts them out of the Council into a Chamber on purpoſe; where he cauſes them to draw by turns out of a Veſſel which contains nine Bowls, mark'd each of them with a figure from 1 to 9, which anſwers to the Magiſtrates to be nam'd: ſo that the Nobleman who draws the figure 1, names a Competitor for the firſt Office, and ſo of the reſt. Every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor is baloted, or choſen by lots afterwards by this <hi>Main;</hi> and if he has two thirds of the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages, he carries the place: whereas if he has not two thirds, he who nam'd him muſt propoſe another, till he pitches upon one who paſſes; and then the Secretary writes the name and quality of the perſon ſo nam'd, under the note of the vacant Office for which he is Competitor. And the ſame is obſerv'd in the other <hi>Mains:</hi> but here it is to be obſerv'd, that all four of the <hi>Mains</hi> do name perſons for every Office, and ſo to each Office there are four ſeveral pretenders.</p>
                  <p>After the Competitors are concluded, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors withdraw, unleſs they be <hi>Councellors, Sage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grands,</hi> Members of the <hi>Council of Ten, Avogadors,</hi> or <hi>Cenſors,</hi> who have priviledg to return again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Council to juſtify their Election. The four Secretaries of the reſpective <hi>Mains</hi> deliver the Note of Competitors to the Chancellor, who reads them aloud to the Table; to the end it may appear, if among them there be any <hi>in divieto,</hi> that is, excluded by the Law. After this he exhorts them in a ſhort ſpeech to poſtpone their private animoſities to the good of their Countrey, and not prefer their paſſions to their duty. In the mean time the Competitors for the firſt Office de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Council, with all their kindred, who are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50981:14"/>
not allowed their ſuffrages by reaſon of their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This done, certain children called <hi>Balotins</hi> are appointed to receive the Balls in two <hi>Boſſols</hi> or boxes; one white to ſignify excluſion, the other red to ſignify admiſſion, by pronouncing the name of the Competitor.</p>
                  <p>The balls made of white ſtuff very ſmall, are put into the white or the green box thorow a common mouth; ſo that no man need fear the eyes of another, becauſe no man can ſee where they are put; and thoſe who have given excluſion may ſwear truly according to their uſual oath, <hi>Caro Signor l'ho ſerviſa, ſi da ſervitor vero.</hi> The balls being taken out, are carried to the Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors to be counted; and the Competitor who has moſt of them carries the Office.</p>
                  <p>After this the Chancellor mentions the next Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy; and the perſons propos'd, who immediately retire out of the Council with all their relations, the firſt being admitted into the Council to elect theſe; and this is called <hi>Render il partito,</hi> becauſe they render what was borrowed: and 'tis the ſame with the reſt.</p>
                  <p>If it happens that none of the Competitors for any of the Offices has more than half the balls, the place is to remain void till another Seſſion: but the Competitors ſhall not be the ſame again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the lots will hardly give them the ſame Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. Again, if any of the Competitors ſhould be left to be drawn after Sun-ſet, he loſes abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely his right; for as it is not permitted to draw, nor indeed any thing elſe in the <hi>Grand Council</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> (no more than it was formerly at <hi>Rome</hi> to deliberate <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ante ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ortum ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, aut post ejus occaſum, Senatus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſultum irritum eſt.</hi> Varro.</note> in the Senat) after Sun-ſet; ſo whatever is then done being thereby actually void, the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of that perſon becomes utterly uſeleſs. And if of the four Competitors three be <hi>in divieto,</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:50981:14"/>
the fourth who remains cannot be choſen for want of a Competitor. But on the contrary, if all the <hi>Mains</hi> concur in the Election of one perſon, (as it falls out ſometimes,) he muſt be choſen, becauſe he was Competitor to himſelf. And the ſame rule holds for thoſe who are nam'd by two <hi>Mains,</hi> which is intimated by the Chancellor in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming the Competitors.</p>
                  <p>In the Election of the <hi>Doge,</hi> their form is quite different; and I ſhall give it in as few words as are poſſible.</p>
                  <p>All the <hi>Nobles</hi> paſt 30 years of age being met in the <hi>Palace of St. Mark,</hi> as many little bowls <note place="margin">The form of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting their <hi>Doge.</hi>
                     </note> are put into an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn</hi> as there are Gentlemen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; 30 of which bowls are gilt. Thoſe to whoſe lot they fall, preſent nine of the gilt bowls before the <hi>Seigniory,</hi> among 24 of the white; and the nine Gentlemen to whom the gilt bowls come, are Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors for 40 others, all of different Families, among whom they have liberty to comprehend themſelves. By lot they are reduced to twelve, which twelve chooſe 25 others; the firſt chooſes three, the other eleven two a-piece. Theſe 25 drawing by lot as the 12, are reduc'd to 9, who have the nomination of 45; that is to ſay, each of them names five. The 45 are by lot reduc'd to eleven, and they again chooſe 41, which are the laſt and principal Electors of the <hi>Duke,</hi> after they have been confirm'd by the <hi>Grand Council.</hi> Nor is it without reaſon the <hi>Venetians</hi> have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed this unuſual form of Election; for by theſe variations, and diverſity of Electors, it is, that all private ambitions are defeated: becauſe all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the choice of thoſe who are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by lot, (which no man can force) all their plots and ſtratagems are ineffectual. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is a way of contenting moſt of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50981:15"/>
chief Families by the ſhare they have in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>Anciently the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>

Which cuſtom has been obſerv'd ſince the time of <hi>Duke Marine Moroſin</hi> to this day; only with this difference, that in his days it was ſufficient to have 21 voices to be elected <hi>Duke;</hi> and at preſent there are 25 required at the leaſt.</p>
                  <p>In the Election of Magiſtrates there are no doubtful voices, becauſe they have too much choice among the Competitors, to be in doubt what is to be done: but yet in their Balotings certain rules are obſerved, as alſo in their Criminal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where the doubtful voices are allowed to the weaker party. For example, If one of the <hi>Nobles,</hi> againſt whom proceſs is form'd, has fewer voices in the Baloting than his accuſers; the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincere</hi> (for ſo it is they call the doubtful voices) are reckon'd to him, with which adddition, if yet his number be found inferior to his adverſary, the Noble is condemn'd: On the contrary, he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd, if the adverſe party, with the addition of the <hi>Non-ſincere</hi> voices, has fewer than he. But if he be not clear'd without the addition of the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincere</hi> voices, the Baloting begins again, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues till either the one or the other has more than a moiety of the Yea's or the No's: for the <hi>Non-ſincere</hi> voices ſerve only to ſuſpend Judgment, as the Code of <hi>Venice</hi> tells us; <hi>Non faciunt Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium, ſed illud impediunt</hi>
                  </p>

Furthermore, there are great abuſes in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Judgments of this Council, in which all things are carried according to the caprice or ignorance of the young Gentlemen, of which it is full. Hence it was, that the Senator <hi>John Sagrede</hi> ſaid well in his Oration for <hi>General Moroſini;</hi> that it was not to be admir'd if the plurality of voices went at firſt for the <hi>Avogador Correr</hi> the accuſer, among ſuch a number of young men, who receive blindly the firſt impreſſions, and ſuffer themſelves to be carried away like the Tide: 'tis the very word he uſed after he had compared the <hi>Grand Council</hi> to a tempeſtuous Sea. From whence we may judg, whether the <hi>Government</hi> has done wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to allow the <hi>Nobles</hi> deliberative voices from the firſt day of their entrance into the Council; whereas formerly they were novices for two years before they were admitted to the lots.</p>
                  <p>Selling of voices is another great miſchief, the rich buying the ſuffrages of the poor, whereby they make themſelves ſlaves to their equals. 'Tis true, it may be objected that kind of trade keeps up the correſpondence and concord betwixt the one and the other; but whether that be ſo or not, it is an abuſe that draws many inconveniences along with it. Anciently this bartering and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of Office was forbidden; now there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more frequent among them, and the <note n="*" place="margin">See the Remarks.</note> 
                     <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio</hi> is a publick Fair licenſed by the corruption of the times, where all Offices are to be ſold.</p>
                  <p>The Law permits not any of the <hi>Nobles</hi> to ſit in the <hi>Graud Council</hi> before they be 25 years of age; but the <hi>Seigniory</hi> admits every year a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number which they call the <hi>Barberins:</hi> and this they do by lots, to avoid the envy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content of the pretenders, who thereby have no reaſon to complain, or be diſſatisfied, when fortune
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50981:16"/>
is not ſo favourable to them as to the reſt. Their method is thus.</p>
                  <p>On the third of <hi>December</hi> the pretenders pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves to the <hi>Avogadors</hi> to certify their age, which muſt be full twenty years; as alſo that they are legitimately deſcended from Noble <hi>Venetians.</hi> Having ſatisfied them in that, the Clerk of the <hi>Avogadory</hi> gives them Atteſtations ſign'd by that Office, which Atteſtation they carry to the Secretary of the <hi>Quarenty Criminal,</hi> who all put their names to ſo many ſeveral Notes.</p>
                  <p>The next morning the ſaid Secretary preſents the Notes to the <hi>Colledg,</hi> where there are two <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rns</hi> plac'd before the <hi>Duke;</hi> in one of which ſo many Copper-bowls are put, as there are pretenders: but let their number be what it will, there are never more of the bowls gilt than 31. In the other <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn</hi> are put the Notes, which the Duke draws out one by one; and delivering them to the Secretary, cauſes him to read the name pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly; and then the <hi>Balotin,</hi> who is a child, takes a bowl out of the other <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn</hi> for the Gentleman whoſe name is proclaim'd; and if he lights upon a gilt-bowl he is admitted of the <hi>Grand Council;</hi> but if his bowl be white he is excluded: and ſo with the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the <hi>Seigniory</hi> diſpences with the age of their <hi>Nobles,</hi> in recompence of the ſervice of their Fathers, Brothers, or other Relations. Sometimes they ſell thoſe Diſpenſations, (as they did during the war in <hi>Candy,)</hi> and the money they receive for them is called <hi>il depoſito del Conſiglio,</hi> the <hi>depoſitum</hi> of the Council.</p>
                  <p>And here it is to be obſerved, The <hi>Nobles</hi> are not of the body of the Republick but from the day of their admiſſion into the <hi>Grand Council</hi> which for them is a kind of ſecond Nativity, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

If theſe pretenders have more than a molety of ſuffrages in their Baloting, they are received as <hi>Nobles,</hi> otherwiſe they are excluded. But if the voices be divided, (which is called at <hi>Venice, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pattar,)</hi> the buſineſs is put off to another Seſſion: or if there happens a <hi>Patta,</hi> or any other difficulty in reſpect of the <hi>Non-ſincere,</hi> (which are uſed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in theſe Balotings,) all is referr'd to a third and laſt Council; for one and the ſame buſineſs cannot be protracted above three Seſſions.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Procurators of St. Mark</hi> are excluded the <hi>Grand Council</hi> by reaſon of their dignity, which being the moſt eminent in that State next to the <hi>Ducal,</hi> is the cauſe they have no paſſive voice in the Council; that is to ſay, there is no Office to which they can pretend, till the <hi>Interregnum,</hi> in which they are in election to be <hi>Dukes.</hi> It is the Law in <hi>Venice,</hi> that the <hi>Nobles</hi> which have no paſſive voice in the Councils, can have no active voice there. But when the <hi>Procurators</hi> are <hi>Sage-Grands,</hi> which is a dignity in the nomination of the Senat, they are admitted to the <hi>Grand Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> as <hi>Sage-Grands,</hi> not as <hi>Procurators.</hi>
                  </p>

                     </note> is, becauſe theſe Lords are oblig'd to watch as Guards of the Palace, and of the place <hi>St. Mark,</hi> during the Seſſion of the <hi>Grand Council;</hi> that if
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50981:17"/>
in the mean time any popular Commotion ſhould ariſe, there might be perſons of Authority ready to ſuppreſs it.</p>
                  <p>But though the <hi>Grand Council</hi> comprehends the whole body of the <hi>Nobles,</hi> it has not the whole authority of the State; for the rights of Majeſty are divided betwixt the Council and the Senat. The firſt has Authority to make Laws, or aboliſh them, to elect Magiſtrates, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Councils; as formerly that in <hi>Rome</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to the People, according to that ancient ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Auctoritas in Senatu, poteſtas in Populo.</hi> The ſecond has power of making War and Peace, Leagues and Truces; to lay Impoſts and Taxes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the People: to put the value upon money, with the abſolute diſpoſition of the Treaſury. It diſpoſes of all military Commands both at Land and Sea; and all temporary Offices, called by them <hi>Cariche a tempo,</hi> created only upon emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. It ſends Succors to their Allies, names Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, Reſidents, Secretaries of their Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, who depend wholly upon it, and are recall'd, continued, corrected, or rewarded as it pleaſes. So that the rights of Majeſty being equally divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded betwixt the <hi>Grand Council,</hi> which conſiſts of all the <hi>Nobles,</hi> and the Senat, which is a ſelect party; the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> may be ſaid to be almoſt an <hi>Ariſto-Democracy,</hi> like that in <hi>Sparta</hi> after the inſtitution of the <hi>Ephori;</hi> and that in <hi>Rome,</hi> when the Authority was divided betwixt the People and the Senate, who made diſtinct and ſeparate Laws; the firſt the <hi>Plebiſcita,</hi> the ſecond the <hi>Senatus-conſulta;</hi> though to take it in ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is a pure <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> ſeeing the Duke has no abſolute power, and the People no part in the publick adminiſtration.

                  <p>It is the <hi>Grand Council</hi> the <hi>Nobles</hi> play all their pranks, and exerciſe all their private ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities, to exclude their adverſaries from Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, without the leaſt regard to their merit. There it is they pretend to do all by Lots; but it is not with little balls of white ſtuff, but with large pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents quite contrary to their promiſes.</p>

THE Eccleſiaſticks as well of the <hi>Nobles</hi> as <hi>Populace,</hi> are excluded from all Office, and uncapable of being of any publick Council, though the Biſhop and Curats of that City were admitted into the Councils before the Reformation 1298. But this Regulation ſhuts the door upon all Enterprizes from the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> in temporal matters. For the <hi>Pope</hi> having the nomination of the Biſhops, and the diſpoſing of almoſt all the Benefices in that State, it would be no hard thing for him to get a party in the <hi>Senat</hi> that might carry moſt of their deliberations, by the aſſiſtance of ſuch of the <hi>Nobles,</hi> as, like the Eccleſiaſticks, depend upon, and expect recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence from him. The Law excludes alſo ſuch of the <hi>Nobles</hi> as have Cardinals to their Brother, Unckle or Nephew, from all deliberations touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eccleſiaſtick affairs.

All the Noblemen are ſubject to rules in reſpect of their age; not one of them but muſt attend the juſt number of years, and begin by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Offices, riſing by degrees, <hi>Sin dalle ultime moſſe,</hi> as they ſay: that is, they muſt begin at one end of the courſe, and from thence advance gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually to the other; ſo that before one can ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the great Offices, he muſt be of a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable age: as it was anciently in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> where they were to be old men before they could be capable of great honours, <hi>In ſola Sparta expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit ſeniſcere.</hi> And the ſame thing is imply'd by the two baskets of Medlars covered with ſtraw, which is painted at the foot of the great Stair-caſe of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> (by which we aſcend to the <hi>Grand Council,</hi> and to the <hi>Pregadi,)</hi> and ſhews, that as the Medlars ripen in ſtraw, ſo the minds of young men muſt ripen with expectation, till they have gain'd experience and qualification that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them to the Government. It is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over no ill policy to conduct their Nobles by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and as it were from Tribunal to Tribunal, if it were only to keep them in perpetual pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and emulation, and to encourage them in the ſervice of their Countrey, by the hopes of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving one day at the higheſt dignity and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whereas if the young Noblemen ſhould jump into the great Offices at <hi>Venice,</hi> where there is nothing perpetual, they would refuſe the reſt, and there would be no body to execute them. This has already hapned too often; and thoſe who have exerciſed great Offices, thought it beneath them to accept of inferior. For this reaſon the <hi>Seig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niory</hi>

                  <p n="4">IV. The Noblemen cannot hold many Offices at a time, how ſmall or inconſiderable ſoever they be: by which means the Publick is better ſerv'd, and more of them are employed. But it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to quit one Office for a better, if he be choſen to it, though in his firſt Office his time be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd.</p>

                  <p n="7">VII. The Magiſtrates in <hi>Venice,</hi> and upon the Continent, cannot lay down their Authority, though their time be expir'd, till the <hi>Grand Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> has appointed their Succeſſors. They cannot
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50981:19"/>
be abſent from their Charges, without permiſſion from the <hi>Seigniory,</hi> which will hardly be granted but upon very good cauſe; ſo that the Publick ſervice is ſeldom interrupted: but in caſe of the ſickneſs of an Officer 'tis otherwiſe; for if they ſee 'tis like to be chronical, others are immediately ſubſtituted in their place. <note n="*" place="margin">See the Remarks.</note> And if it happens to any of the <hi>Rettori</hi> of the Towns, the Captain exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes for the <hi>Podeſta,</hi> or the <hi>Podeſta</hi> for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and in caſe both be ſick, ſome other Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> in Office upon the place, till upon notice the <hi>Seigniory</hi> ſupplies them: by which means there happens no delay in their Affairs, and no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of Orders.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. The Noblemen who are Knights of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> have no more part of the <hi>Government</hi> than if they were no Noblemen, becauſe that Dignity ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects them to the Laws and Statutes of a Forreign Prince: ſo that ordinarily there are but two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen <hi>Venetians</hi> of that Order, one of the Houſe of <hi>Carnarro,</hi> and the other of the Houſe of the <hi>Lippomade;</hi> and that to preſerve two conſiderable Commands, the firſt, the Government of <hi>Treviſa,</hi> with the Title of <hi>Grand Commander of Cyprus,</hi> and the other of <hi>Conillan</hi> in the Marches of <hi>Treviſan.</hi>

It is forbidden to the <hi>Nobles</hi> to receive Preſents or Penſions from Forreign Princes; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to purchaſe Lands under their Dominions, upon penalty of degradation from their Nobility, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation of their Eſtates, and Baniſhment; which is the true way of obliging them to the common Defence of their Countrey, where all their Eſtates, and all their Hopes do lie: whereas if they were ſuffered to have their ſolid Eſtabliſhment elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, they would many times betray the Publick
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50981:20"/>
Intereſt, in Complacency to thoſe Princes in whoſe Territories their Eſtates lay; which in time might be a prejudice, if not ſubverſion to the whole <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> And it was by this means the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> of <hi>Genoa</hi> ſubjected it ſelf to the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> who knew well enough to make his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the fooliſh ambition thoſe Nobles had for Authority and Juriſdiction in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> not ſuffering them to diſpoſe of them but to others of their own Countrey, to the end that they might preſerve their Dominion over them, and oblige them in perpetual Servitude.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. The <hi>Nobles</hi> are not permitted to purchaſe <hi>Fiefs</hi> or <hi>Lordſhips</hi> upon the <hi>Terra-firma,</hi> that there might be neither ſuperiority nor dependance to deſtroy the Equality among them. Beſides, it would occaſion jealouſie and diſorder betwixt the ancient Nobility that are poor, and the new, who being generally rich, would in time buy the whole <hi>Terra-firma.</hi> Formerly they were not allowed Houſes of Pleaſure upon the <hi>Continent,</hi> but of late that has been indulg'd: ſo that in <hi>Venice</hi> 'tis quite otherwiſe than in <hi>Genoa,</hi> where particular Perſons are rich, but the <hi>Government</hi> poor; but here private Perſons are poor, and the Publick wealthy, having <note place="margin">

                  <p n="11">XI. The Noblemen are not ſuffered to marry with Strangers, nor their Daughters to the Subjects of another Prince, though they be Gentlemen: and the deſign thereby is to preſerve their Riches among themſelves, which otherwiſe would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly tranſported by thoſe Marriages; and to ſtop the ambitious carreer of the ancient No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, who by Marrying with Forreign Princes,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50981:20"/>
would by degrees come to deſpiſe all Matches at home; and laſtly, to deprive thoſe Families of a retreat to thoſe Princes with whom they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied; which would render them more bold in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizing againſt their Country, as being not eaſily contented with the Parity there. Moreover, it would be almoſt impoſſible to keep any thing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret in a <hi>Senat</hi> Conſtituted of ſuch <hi>Nobles</hi> as were under forreign Alliance, which would beget new factions and diviſions at home. But they may mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their Daughters to ſuch Gentlemen of the <hi>Terra-firma,</hi> as thereby become better-affected to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility, whoſe protection they are willing to purchaſe. The Law ſuffers the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to marry with Citizens, to fortify their Party againſt the <hi>Populace,</hi> in caſe they ſhould mutiny againſt them; thereby not ſo much communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as corroborating their Power by uniting with the Citizens, as with a Body capable with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to reſiſt any Effort of the multitude. By this means likewiſe the <hi>Nobles</hi> that are poor do ſometimes marry advantageouſly, there being no rich Citizen but is very ready to embrace an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with a Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> it being an honour and protection to his whole Family: And in this the <hi>Seigniory</hi> is not without a peculiar intereſt; for theſe ſorts of Marriages do put the <hi>Nobles</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a condition of ſerving the Publick in Embaſſies and other expenſive employments: Not, but that ſometimes the <hi>Nobles,</hi> who marry theſe Citizens Daughters, grow contemptible to the People, who do frequently call their Children <hi>Amphibia.</hi> And yet 'tis every day to be ſeen in <hi>Venice,</hi> Noblemen of the laſt impreſſion do marry Ladies of the firſt; the firſt purchaſing their Wives, the latter their Husbands. But when a Nobleman marries a Citizen, his Contract muſt paſs the approbation of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50981:21"/>
the <hi>Grand Council,</hi> otherwiſe their Children can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſs for Noble <hi>Venetians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By Citizens are meant the <hi>Secretaries of State, Advocates, Notaries, Phyſicians, Mercers, Drapers, Glaſs-makers, &amp;c.</hi> And if a Nobleman marries out of this <hi>Category,</hi> his Children are ignoble, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into Citizens. As appear'd in the Caſe of the Procurator <hi>John Baptiſto Cornero Piſcopia;</hi> who, during the War in <hi>Candia,</hi> was glad to purchaſe Nobility for two of his Children, becauſe their Mother was Daughter to a <hi>Gondolier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">XII. There is no Elderſhip or <hi>Seniority</hi> among the <hi>Nobles;</hi> which Law agrees very well with the Form of that <hi>Government,</hi> and prevents diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that quickly would happen. If younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who have equal ſhare in the Civil Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, ſhould find themſelves inferior to their Elder Brothers in reſpect of their Eſtates, many of them would turn Enemies to their Country; and, as occaſion offer'd, ſtir up and agitate ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the State. Beſides that, particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would in time become too conſiderable and potent. For this Cauſe the <hi>Seigniory</hi> at one time obliged three Brothers of the Houſe of <hi>Cornaro</hi> to marry, under penalty of Baniſhment, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation of their Eſtates, which was computed at more than 100000 Crowns <hi>per ann.</hi> which in thoſe days was a prodigious Revenue. And laſt of all, this Equality of diviſion renders them all capable of ſerving the Publick; whereas if the Eldeſt went away with the whole, the State would be depriv'd of the ſervice of the Nobility, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Younger Brothers, would be uſeleſs by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their poverty. Nor does this way of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage or diviſion hinder the Greatneſs of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, ſeeing for the moſt part all the Brothers
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50981:21"/>
live together, and but one of them marries, and that is commonly the youngeſt; for whom the other are contented to ſcrape, and to ſpare, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he be a man of Compliance.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. All the Noblemen, without excepting the <hi>Duke</hi> himſelf, are liable to Publick Charge during the War, and each of them pays according to his Revenue; as anciently in <hi>Sparta,</hi> where the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Senat</hi> were tax'd as the People, who thereby were made more obedient to the Nobility, and the Nobility more moderate and juſt.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. The Magiſtrates who judg in Civil Cauſes, are not allow'd to receive Viſits from either of the Parties, nor any Recommendation from their Friends, under penalty of Degradation, and a Fine. But in Criminal Affairs ſolicitations are allow'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in matters of State. Their reaſon is, becauſe in Civil Affairs it would endanger the juſtice of a Cauſe, to allow ſuch application to the Judges: But in Criminal Cauſes all ways are left open for the defence of the Accuſed, and for the compaſſion of their Friends, ſo that at <hi>Venice,</hi> if a man's Cauſe be not bad indeed, he may eaſily get off.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. A Nobleman may Plead at the Bar like an Advocate, without diminution to his Quality. About 200 years ſince, all their Advocates were Noblemen, appointed by the <hi>Grand Council</hi> to the number of 24; and had all of them allowance from the Publick, being forbidden to take Preſents or Mony, that the nobleneſs of the Profeſſion might not be ſullied by ſo ignoble a Cuſtom, and that in all Proceſſes it might be their intereſt to give a diſpatch. But this is now quite laid aſide, there being ſcarce any of the Nobility that will
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50981:22"/>
give themſelves that trouble, any more than to read Law publickly at <hi>Padua,</hi> as formerly was done by the <hi>Patricians;</hi> who were ſo far from thinking it derogatory, that they made it their principal glory. But ſince this virtuous Emulation ceaſed among them, we have found debauchery and ignorance ſucceed, to the great prejudice of that State.</p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. The Noblemen are oblig'd in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils to make uſe of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Language, to avoid the envy of ſuch of the Nobility, as underſtanding no other, cannot endure a better; and therefore there has many times been clapping of hands, and crying out to hold, in full Council, when any of them has but begun to ſpeak <hi>Latin;</hi> ſo wild are they in <hi>Commonwealths,</hi> and ſo odious is Novelty. 'Tis true, in <hi>Venice</hi> it is neceſſary all Gentlemen ſpeak the ſame Language, eſpecially in Council, leſt otherwiſe many of them might be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from ſpeaking their minds, out of a modeſt diffidence they ſhould not deliver themſelves as well as others. But if a man be Eloquent, his beſt way is to diſſemble it, as <note n="*" place="margin">Coſtus <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ex Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae facun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diae, ſed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendi ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem apta trepida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultavit.</hi> Tac. Hiſt.</note> a <hi>Swiſs</hi> Deputy did when ſent to <hi>Cecinna;</hi> otherwiſe the averſion of his Auditors will work more upon them, than the Orator's Arguments.</p>
                  <p n="17">XVII. All ſort of Correſpondence with Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors or Forreign Miniſters is forbidden to the Noblemen upon pain of Death; by which means the tranſactions of the <hi>Senat</hi> are conceal'd, which otherwiſe would be no hard matter among ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gentlemen to pick out by Converſation and Preſents: witneſs the Example of <hi>Cornaro,</hi> whoſe fidelity was corrupted by the <hi>Marqueſs de la Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente</hi>'s Bills of Exchange. For this reaſon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50981:22"/>
                     <hi>Claudius</hi> forbid ſuch of the <hi>Patricians</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Senat,</hi> as had not wherewithal to maintain their Dignity.</p>
                  <p>But the form of an <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> ſuffers not ſuch an Excluſion, which would deſtroy the Equality of the <hi>Nobles;</hi> and by the poorer ſort (who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in greater number) be look'd upon as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, a thing abſolutely inſupportable among <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans,</hi> and which would certainly <note n="*" place="margin">

And this is ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly obſerv'd, that if a Nobleman ſhould be diſcovered in diſcourſe with any Perſon in relation to any forreign Agent or Embaſſador, and it ſhould come to the knowledg of the Inquiſitors of State before he diſcovered it himſelf, he would not be ſuffered to live two hours. One day a Senator of the Houſe of <hi>Tron</hi> finding me at the Houſe of the Curate <hi>de Santa Maria Mater Domini,</hi> ſtarted and ran away as if the Plague had been there. Twice I was met by one of the Procurators, who with an hardineſs that would have been fatal to many others, ſtaid ſome time with me in a <hi>Stationer's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop;</hi> and though I offer'd it, would not let me depart.</p>
                  <p>This Prohibition beginning to be neglected, was reviv'd in the year 1618, upon the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Conſpiracy by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>

                     <hi>Triumvirate</hi> againſt their <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> from which time they have look'd upon forreign Embaſſadors as ſo many conceal'd Enemies; and to make them the more dreadful to the Nobility, the <hi>Senat</hi> very cunningly gave it out, that the <hi>Marqueſs</hi>

                     <hi>de la Fuentes</hi> himſelf had betrayed <hi>Cornaro,</hi> that the Sum he had conſign'd for him might be ſtop'd.</p>
                  <p>But though all ſort of Communication with forreign Embaſſadors be forbidden to the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, nevertheleſs there are Priviledg'd places where they may meet in diſguiſe, as at their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gaming-houſes, which they call <hi>Ridotti,</hi> in Balls, in particular Houſes during the <hi>Carneval,</hi> at Weddings, and ſeveral other Feaſts and Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: But here they are not ſuffered to converſe, eſpecially at the <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> where ſilence is kept as ſtrict as at a Sermon; and men are ſeen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to loſe their whole ſtock, without looſening their teeth: upon which ſcore the <hi>Venetians</hi> are counted very good Gameſters.</p>
                  <p>As to the Rules the State of <hi>Venice</hi> has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd for its own Embaſſadors in the Forreign Courts, they are well worth our knowledg, and I will give you ſome of them here.</p>
                  <p n="18">XVIII. The <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſadors cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the place of their Reſidence till their Succeſſor be arrived, and by them preſented to the Prince; if they do, they are look'd upon as Deſertors of their Embaſſy: <note n="*" place="margin">Redire praepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere, eſt legationem deſerere.</note> which is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd over by his own hand, and the new Comer put into poſſeſſion of his Charge, and inſtructed <hi>viva voce</hi> in whatever is requiſite for him to know towards the diſcharging himſelf worthily of his Employment. And this they do with great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality one to the other, not only in obedience to the expreſs Orders of the <hi>Senat,</hi> but in honour to themſelves, by cauſing their Succeſſors to take the ſame Meaſures, and follow the ſame Methods as they had done before.</p>
                  <p>They are obliged to Preſent the <hi>Senat</hi> with a Relation, in writing, of their Embaſſies at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn:

for though 'tis to be ſuppos'd they gave Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in retail before, in their weekly Diſpatches; yet it is eſteem'd for the intereſt of the Publick to have a <hi>Breviate</hi> of them, that may ſave them the labour of rummaging among their Letters and Memorials, to find out a thing that this way may be found in a moment.

And by theſe Relations it is, the <hi>Senat</hi> underſtands the whole Strength of their Neighbours, the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Territories, their Armies, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, and their Expence: and this Manuſcript is <note place="margin">

The Embaſſadors introduced are plac'd on the <hi>Duke</hi>'s right-hand, if they be ſent from Kings; and if from a <hi>Duke,</hi> they have the ſame place: but the <hi>Colledg</hi> riſes not till their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Reverence in the middle of the Chamber; neither do they riſe at their going out, till their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Salutation. Forreign Generals are plac'd as the Embaſſadors, whereas the Generals that are Noble <hi>Venetians</hi> are ſet below the Councellors, but the <hi>Seigniory</hi> riſes not either when they come in, or go forth. The <hi>Receiver of Malta</hi> (who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways one of the Commanders of the Orders) ſits next under the Deputy from the <hi>Quarantie Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minelle,</hi> by which he is diſtinguiſhed from all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents, without exception to the Emperors; who for that cauſe negotiates with them by an <hi>Agent,</hi> with the Character of Secretary, for he is ſeldom known to have any Embaſſador there.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and the Royal Embaſſadors are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd at their Publick Entrances by ſixty of the Senators, and Complemented by a Knight of <hi>the Golden Stool,</hi> which is the mark of a Nobleman that has been an Embaſſador. But for the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador of a <hi>Duke,</hi> the <hi>Colledg</hi> orders them to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by forty <hi>Nobles</hi> of the <hi>Sous-Pregadi,</hi> who

are no better than bare aſſiſtants to the <hi>Senat;</hi> and no perſon is ſent to receive a Reſident, but he is of the number of the <hi>Publici Repreſentanti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the Deputies of Towns and Corporations under the obedience of the <hi>Seigniory,</hi> they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver admitted to Audience from the <hi>Colledg</hi> but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on three Conditions; that they have Credentials from the Governor or <hi>Podeſta</hi> of the place from whence they are ſent; that they have a Memorial of their Demands under the hand of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor; and another ſeal'd Letter from him, in which he gives his judgment of their Affair to the <hi>Senat,</hi> that the Prince may not be ſurpriz'd. But if theſe Deputies come with complaints againſt their Superiors, (which is but rare) it ſuffices for their admiſſion, if their Letters be only from the Commonalty, or Corporation.</p>
                  <p>In a word, it belongs to the <hi>Colledg</hi> to call the <hi>Senat,</hi> but by mutual dependance it obeys it when met, and receives and executes its Reſolutions and Orders: One propoſes, the other diſpoſes, and theſe two Councils act always by agreement. When the <hi>Senat</hi> has taken any thing ill from a Prince, and is willing to ſhew a Reſentment, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the <hi>Colledg</hi> to refuſe Audience to his Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador or Miniſter.

                  <p>THE <hi>Senat</hi> is the Soul of the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> as the <hi>Grand Council</hi> is the Body. It is the Fountain of Peace and War, the Balance that keeps an Harmony and Exactneſs in all the parts of the State. It is called <hi>Pregadi,</hi> becauſe that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly there being no ſet-days for the meeting of the ſaid Council, the principal Members of the City were <hi>invited</hi> upon extraordinary Emergency, and it therefore retains the Name of <hi>Pregadi,</hi> or <hi>Invited Aſſembly;</hi> though the Cuſtom of calling them together in that manner is laid aſide.</p>
                  <p>At firſt the <hi>Senat</hi> conſiſted only of ſixty Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, but upon any great occaſion they added 25 or 30 more by Commiſſion; but their Commiſſion ceas'd as ſoon as the Debate was reſolv'd. They proceeded in this manner in the time of <hi>Johannes Delfinus,</hi> in the Treaty of Peace with <hi>Lodovic</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> about the year 1360. Under the <hi>Duke Laurence Celſus</hi> during the Revolt of <hi>Candia</hi> 1363, and under Prince <hi>Michael Sten,</hi> upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the War in <hi>Ferrara</hi> againſt the Marqueſs <hi>Albert</hi> of <hi>Eſte</hi> in the year 1410. But the War in <hi>Lombardy</hi> following ſome years after, the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> eſtabliſhed in the year 1435 a perpetual <hi>Giunta</hi> or ſupply of ſixty more Senators, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the multitude of Affairs that were then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <p>There are in the <hi>Pregadi</hi> ſeveral Magiſtrates, ſome with voices by vertue of their Offices, as the Procurators, the <hi>Ten,</hi> and all the Judges of the <hi>Quarenty Criminelle;</hi> others are there only to hear, and learn, as the <hi>Sous-Pregadi:</hi> ſo that the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Senat</hi> conſiſts of three Orders, as that of <hi>Rome,</hi> Senators in Ordinary, like the hundred <hi>Patres</hi> created by <hi>Romulus;</hi> Senators additional, like the <hi>Patres conſcripti</hi> of the <hi>Sabins,</hi> aſſociated by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi> with the former; and ſimple Aſſiſtants, like thoſe in <hi>Rome,</hi> who were called <hi>Pedarii,</hi> who had no right of opinion: the whole amounting to 300 <hi>Nobles,</hi> among whom it is marvellous to conſider how ſecret their Affairs were kept, as if none of them were privy, or as if they had power to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get whatever they heard. <hi>Non dicam unum ſed neminem audiſſe crederes, quod tam multorum auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſuerat commiſſum,</hi> Valer. l. 2. c. 2.</p>

                     <hi>Venice</hi> affords us Examples not at all inferior.

                  <p>In the mean time the <hi>Venetians</hi> might reduce their <hi>Senate</hi> to a ſmaller number; and the more eaſily, becauſe the <hi>Pregadi</hi> changing every year, all the Nobility might have hopes of being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in their turns.

                  <p>Some may find fault, that the <hi>Senat</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> changes every year, the rather becauſe the affairs of State, which require long experience, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways tranſacted by new <hi>Senators,</hi> who ſometimes miſtake the Means and the Conſequence for want of due inſtruction in the beginning.

But this defect, if it be one, is neither without cauſe, nor remedy in <hi>Venice.</hi> For as the <hi>Senators</hi> may be continued by new Election, there always remains a good part of the old. Beſides, there be ſo many Magiſtrates admitted into the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> that there are conſtantly ſome, who having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, are well inform'd of the precedent nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations. And for this reaſon it is, that ſo many of the <hi>Nobles</hi> are received into the <hi>Senat,</hi> that by hearing what paſſes, they bring themſelves by degrees to a notion of thoſe things which they are to manage in their turns. And if the Emperor <hi>Soliman</hi> ſaid, that a Prince to be well advis'd ought never to make uſe of one Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter above once, becauſe the deſire of gaining the eſteem and favour of the Prince, is a ſtrong mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to make him act as he ſhould; as <note n="*" place="margin">Sejanus <hi>incipiente adhuc po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liis noteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere vole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat.</hi> Tac.

In a word, by this yearly change a Gate is always open to deſert; thoſe who are found improper, may be rejected at the years end without offence, and more able perſons ſubſtituted in their ſtead: Whereas, the <hi>Senat</hi> being perpetual, the unfit muſt be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as well as the fit, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerved as a great defect in the <hi>Senat</hi> of <hi>Sparta,</hi> becauſe ſome there are whoſe minds are aſſoon ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annuated as <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>Let us ſee now how the <hi>Senat</hi> proceeds in its Deliberations and Elections: After which I ſhall treat of their Politicks at home, and their Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences abroad; the two main points in which their Civil Government conſiſts.</p>
                  <p>As to the Order obſerv'd by the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> or <hi>Senat,</hi> in the diſcuſſion of their Affairs, I have ſaid before, that nothing is tranſacted there but what has firſt paſs'd the <hi>Colledg,</hi> whoſe office in reſpect of this Council, is almoſt the ſame as the <hi>Senat</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>'s was in regard of the People; that is to ſay, to propoſe to them ſuch things as were to be debated by them. And becauſe many times the <hi>Colledg</hi> is divided, one of the Secretaries ſets down every mans opinion with his Name by it, and brings his Note to the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> where being read publickly, every man ſpeaks <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con</hi> as he thinks fit; and afterwards they proceed to Balo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as follows.</p>
                  <p>For every recommendation there is a Secretary that gathers the voices, and goes from hand to hand naming the Author; as of old the <hi>Rogatores Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragiorum</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:50981:29"/>
did in <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe Secretaries have each of them a white Box in their hand, and the <hi>Nobles</hi> give their Balls to which of them they pleaſe. There are two other Secretaries fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the firſt, one of them with a green Box for the Balls of the Diſſenters, and the other with a red Box for the <hi>Nonſinceri,</hi> which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to the <hi>Non liquet</hi> among the <hi>Romans.</hi> And he who hath moſt Voices (provided they exceed a moiety of the whole Court) is received by an Arreſt of the <hi>Senat,</hi> in the nature of the <hi>Senatus-Conſultum</hi> in <hi>Rome.</hi> But if none of them amount to the juſt Number, they begin their Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotation again, rejecting thoſe who have the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt voices, that the others may paſs with more eaſe. Otherwiſe new men are to be propoſed, as when in the firſt Balotation the <hi>Nonſinceri</hi> have more than half the Voices, which is a ſign they do not agree to any that are recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>But though the <hi>Nobles</hi> of the <hi>Senat</hi> have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſpeak for or againſt any one propos'd, as he thinks fit; yet none of them, unleſs it be the <hi>Duke,</hi> the higheſt Councellours, or the <hi>Sage-Grands</hi> can propoſe any to be Baloted in their own name. But if any of the ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, or <hi>Sage-Grands</hi> recommends him as one likely to be ſerviceable to the Commonwealth, he may be admitted to the Balot: Which is very wiſely contriv'd by the <hi>Senat,</hi> to avoid confuſion and delay in their Affairs, if it were permitted to each of the 300 Nobles to propoſe his own man.</p>
                  <p>As to the Magiſtrates choſen by the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> they are not beholding to lot, they are elected upon due knowledg and conſideration of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, which is a thing not to be found out by

This fury ſpread it ſelf among the neareſt Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; many Younger Brothers violating the rights of Nature, and invading their Elder Brothers, who were no Counts like them. In the mean time the Exchequer grew rich by the confiſcations of theſe Gentlemen Murderers, and the <hi>Senat</hi> extinguiſhed by the continual effuſion of Blood, that Fire which they ſo lately had kindled.</p>

                  <p>As to the People in <hi>Venice,</hi> the <hi>Senat</hi> apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Unity and Power, by deſign have kept the City divided into two contrary Parties, one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellans</hi> and <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi> in <hi>Venice.</hi>

                  <p>So it is not to be imagined the publick and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Conflicts betwixt the <hi>Caſtellans</hi> and the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colates</hi> are made for entertainment of the People, or Strangers, but to prevent the cooling of the Heat and Animoſity in both Parties, which inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly fortifies the Authority of the <hi>Senat,</hi> whom it would be no hard matter to ruine by their Union.

exemptions, and conſiderable employments, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of them for Reſidents, and Secretaries of all their Councils and Embaſſies, by which they ſeem to be equal in ſome meaſure to the <hi>Nobles,</hi> and ſuperiour to the Gentlemen of the <hi>Terra firma,</hi> who are utterly excluded.

                  <p>The Merchant of <hi>Venice</hi> (who is alſo of the Body of Citizens) thinks his condition very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, in reſpect the Nobility is contented to aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate with him in order to Trade: For though all kind of Traffick be prohibited to the <hi>Nobles,</hi> yet underhand they are many times ingaged in partnerſhip without being known, and the <hi>Senat</hi> ſwallows it diſcreetly, becauſe of the benefit it receives thereby, by ſending the ſaid Noblemen on Embaſſies, where they ſpend good part of what they gain'd; whereas there would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be want of rich men to ſuſtain thoſe charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Employments, if their Nobility were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd from that way of enriching themſelves; and by thoſe ways of entertaining their minds, they are hindered from contriving againſt the State.</p>
                  <p>And now one would think the Eccleſiaſticks had great ſubject to complain of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which at this day they have not the leaſt part; which cauſed Cardinal <hi>Zapata</hi> to ſay, that at <hi>Venice</hi> their condition was much worſe than the condition of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> under <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh.</hi> But the <hi>Senat</hi> makes them ample amends for their excluſion, by the liberty it gives them

to live as they pleaſe without any notice of their irregularities: Inſomuch, that they are ſo far from repining, that they believe themſelves in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</p>
                  <p>As to the Nobility, the <hi>Senat</hi> takes particular care to maintain them in unity, knowing well that Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity is dangerous in a free State; <note n="*" place="margin">

To prevent theſe ill conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the <hi>Senat</hi> takes notice of the leaſt difference betwixt the Nobility, and without expecting till the fire be kindled, it choaks it in its embers, and ſtops its progreſs by their vigilance and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; for the <hi>Nobles</hi> are obliged to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate acquieſcence, otherwiſe they run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the diſpleaſure of the <hi>Senat,</hi> let their provocation be never ſo great. Some years ſince, the <hi>Vidmans</hi> being in ſuit with the Family of <hi>Naue,</hi> in which the <hi>Vidmans</hi> Grandfather had ſerved as a Packer, and being reproached by the means of their Extraction in a full Aſſembly, the <hi>Senat</hi> interpos'd, commanded them ſilence, and ordered the Judges to take up the buſineſs, as reflecting upon the whole body of their Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50981:36"/>
Commonwealth. And if in ſome things the new Nobility ſeem inferiour to the ancient, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſoon admitted into the great Offices, it is done only to improve them, to experiment their induſtry in ſmaller Employments, and, as <hi>Sylla</hi> ſays, to enure them to the Oar, before they be truſted with the Helm; without which gradati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Preferment would but expoſe them to the contempt of the People, who commonly deſpiſe thoſe who have been formerly their equals <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>Moreover the <hi>Senat</hi> had never permitted the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ladies to follow the <hi>French</hi> Modes, but by a new luxury to prevent an old diſtinction which they affected in their habit; the Ladies of ancient Families dreſſing their heads <hi>a la Guelfe,</hi> and the other <hi>a la Gibeline,</hi> from whence grew a certain emulation that brake out ſome time into quarrels, and proceeded often to their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, not only to the danger of the Nobility, but to the diſturbance of the State. For in all ſorts of Governments, nothing is more pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than jealouſie and miſunderſtanding betwixt the Governours; the offended party deſiring al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways innovation and change. So it was, that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racleodorus</hi> in <hi>Eubea</hi> taking a pique againſt his Colleagues, ſet up a new form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which the Authority that was formerly in the hands of the Nobility, was transferr'd to the People; as on the contrary, <hi>Duke Peter Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denique</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> transferr'd it from the People to the <hi>Nobles,</hi> to revenge himſelf of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who had refus'd to make him their <hi>Duke.</hi>

The <hi>Senat</hi> governing upon Maxims of Peace, will not endure diſſention either among the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or People; for fear if once they came to Arms, they ſhould take a fancy to alter the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The <hi>Senat</hi> is ſenſible, Ambition and military Gallantry are inſeparable, and that great Courage cannot endure the obſcurity of a private life; of which we have a fair example in the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth, who with all her power was not able to maſter her Generals. And this Maxim is ſo much the better, becauſe the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> not deſigning to aggrandize themſelves by new Acquiſition, but only contriving how they may defend what they have got, have no need of Generals among them, whoſe Ambition would keep them always in alarm; there being but too many of thoſe haughty ſpirits, who believe all things are lawful that conduce to Dominion, and that it is meer madneſs to refuſe it in a puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio of Religion <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>Beſides, the General for a Commonwealth, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf adored by his Souldiers, favoured by fortune, and happy in an opportunity, without more than ordinary moderation, can hardly bring himſelf to depoſe an Authority that he can ſo eaſily keep, and reduce himſelf to an Equality, when it is in his power to Command. Upon which conſideration, the <hi>Senat</hi> has laid it down for a Maxim of State, Never to put the Command of their Land-Armies into the hands of any of their <hi>Nobles;</hi> ſeeing that to arrive at any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in that Trade, they muſt paſs the beſt part of their time upon the <hi>Terra-firma,</hi> and ſeek their employment among forreign Princes, which would quickly make a breach among their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, it being moſt certain, thoſe who had been long abſent from their Country, and taken up a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50981:37"/>
way of living quite contrary to their old, would not accommodate very eaſily with their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions brought up in Idleneſs and Peace; by which means it would not be long before their <hi>Republick</hi> would be perplex'd and embroil'd by its own Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when they have War at Land, they invite to their Service ſome Prince or Forreign Lord, to whom they allow a large Penſion, with the Title of <hi>Generaliſſimo at Land:</hi> I ſay the Title, becauſe he has neither Authority nor Power, the <hi>Senat</hi> appointing conſtantly as his Councel, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Spies, two Senators, which they call <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veditors General of the Army;</hi> who never ſuffer him to be out of their ſight, nor take any Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or undertake any Enterprize without them. On the contrary, he is oblig'd to do as they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect; and let his Experience in Military Affairs be what it will, they ſeldom comply with his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Noblemen of <hi>Venice</hi> being naturally enemies to any Advice that is not their own, as if they deſign'd their Perverſneſs ſhould ſhew their Dominion. And therefore they will not entertain Generals more brave, or of better Conduct than themſelves; becauſe commonly their Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance is but ſmall, and that is a Quality with them equivalent to the greateſt.</p>
                  <p>In the abſence of the <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> the General of the Infantry (a Stranger too) has the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, by a Cuſtom quite different from other Princes; which is a great trouble to the General of the Horſe, as appeared by the Prince of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena,</hi> who quitted the <hi>Venetian</hi> Service upon that Score, during the War of <hi>Mantua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Senat</hi> not only entertains Forreign Generals, but all the Forreign Souldiers they can get, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways retaining a ſpecial care of putting Arms into

                  <p>The pain they find to get Souldiers, by reaſon of the ſlavery in which they keep them, (which is ſuch, that many of them have choſe rather to revolt deſperately to the <hi>Turk,)</hi> conſtrains them to have recourſe to their Allies for ſuccour; but they never do it but in great extremity, being as fearful of the Troops which they employ in their defence, as of thoſe that invade them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is they ſo frequently change the Poſts and Quarters of their Auxiliaries, ſeparating them with great care, and incorporating them with their other Troops, to prevent or defeat any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign their Commanders may have. Sometimes they force their Officers to retire, tiring out their patience by a thouſand affronts; and if they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be obſtinate, and perſons that will not eaſily deſert their Party, they make no great ſcruple to remove them other ways; witneſs <hi>Don Camillo de Gonzague,</hi> who died not many years ſince at <hi>Capo d' Iſtria,</hi> of which they diſcharged themſelves by a ſolemn Service, and a Funeral Oration de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the <hi>Senat.</hi> Many times they chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make a diſhonourable Peace, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue or entertain Auxiliaries in their Defence; ſo much do they abhor that kind of Cattel, which they look upon as little better than Profeſſed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For 'tis the Cuſtom of thoſe States who have over-reach'd their Neighbours and Allies, to apprehend being circumvented themſelves ſome time or other, judging of their enemies by what
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50981:38"/>
they themſelves would do in their places. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Senat</hi> never engages in a War but upon neceſſity, and after they have tried all ways to prevent it, there being no act of Submiſſion that they will refuſe to deliver themſelves from that Plague; and the rather, becauſe their Affairs are ſupported more by their Reputation than Arms.

                     <hi>Andr.

                  <p>And if in thirteen or fourteen Centuries they have grown ſo Potent in <hi>Italy,</hi> it is eaſily imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, it was not ſo much by their Arms, as by their Money and Addreſs, like <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> in his Conqueſts in <hi>Greece.</hi> For Example, when any difference happened betwixt their Neighbours, the <hi>Senat</hi> found ſome way or other of interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, under colour of accommodating their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; but in effect it was to embroil them more, by privately fomenting their Animoſity, exciting the moſt Potent to Revenge, and underhand giving Supplies to the weaker to continue the War, and inſenſibly to ruine them both: ſo that having tired and exhauſted both the one and the other, there was no great difficulty in diſpoſſeſſing them all, by the neceſſity that was upon them of putting
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50981:39"/>
the Conteſted Places into their hands <hi>in Depoſito,</hi> or at leaſt of receiving a <hi>Venetian</hi> Garriſon. In the year 1404 they got poſſeſſion of <hi>Vicenza</hi> by means of Supplies, which they ſent to the ſaid Town to defend them againſt the <hi>Paduans</hi> their mortal enemies. They plundered moſt of the Great Perſons of <hi>Romagna,</hi> ſome they cajol'd by fair promiſes, others they ſurpriz'd, and others they betrayed under the ſacred name of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and pretended Protection. The ſame Practice they uſed with the Nobility of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> eſpecially of the Family of <hi>Polenta,</hi> with the <hi>Manfredi</hi> of <hi>Faienza,</hi> the <hi>Malateſtes</hi> of <hi>Rimini,</hi> and ſeveral others: for they always eſteem'd it more Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to vanquiſh their Enemy by Cunning, than Force of Arms. And what was ſaid of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Sedendo Romanus vincit,</hi> may be ſaid of them; for many Victories have they obtain'd ſitting in their Councils, and in their Cloſets: Yet when Princes have made War upon them, without troubling themſelves to Treat, (in which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their greateſt Talent and Felicity lies,) they never fail to bring them to reaſon. And if Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V, had done as <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV, and <hi>Julius</hi> II did, that is, joyn'd his Spiritual Arms with the Temporal, he had certainly found the <hi>Venetians</hi> more obedient, though perhaps their Cauſe was the better. Of late years they no ſooner ſaw the <hi>French</hi> Army in their Territories, but they betook themſelves to ſuch groſs and mean ſubmiſſion, that their Confederate Princes were amaz'd to find ſo little Courage in thoſe perſons, who before flatter'd themſelves with hopes of chaſing <hi>Lewis</hi> XII out of <hi>Milan,</hi> and ſeizing the whole <hi>Dutchy</hi> for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to make their Dominion as abſolute all over <hi>Italy,</hi> as they had made it in <hi>Romagna:</hi> but the loſs of one Battel at <hi>Vaila</hi> made the <hi>Senat</hi> cry <note place="margin">See the Remarks.</note>

                  <p>Their Neutrality, which is another of their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Maxims to keep themſelves in Peace, has been very prejudicial to them, and ſometimes pull'd War upon their Heads; as it happen'd when they endeavoured to have kept themſelves <hi>Neuter</hi> betwixt <hi>Lewis</hi> XII, and <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor, at that time engaged in War about the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Milan.</hi> For theſe two great Princes being equally incens'd againſt this <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> (whoſe Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip added nothing to their Affairs) united in ſpight, and form'd the Project of the League of <hi>Cambray,</hi> in which all the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> were concern'd.

                  <p>But as much averſion as the <hi>Senat</hi> has to Land-Forces, no leſs is its inclination to the Forces by Sea, upon which depends abſolutely the Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Government,</hi> from whence it has had its riſe and encreaſe.

                  <p>The <hi>Senat</hi> likewiſe obliges the rich Merchants who have Ships at Sea, to entertain at their own Charges two or three decayed Gentlemen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to carry a certain quantity of Goods with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying any Duty for Exportation; or if they have not Money to furniſh themſelves for Traffick during their Voyage, the ſaid Gentlemen have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſell their Priviledg to other People, and ſupply themſelves that way, which is a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to their miſery, and makes them in love with a Profeſſion that is ſo much to their advantage: beſides the hopes they have of arriving one day at the Chief Command of their Fleet, <hi>Venice</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring thoſe Commands like the <hi>Senat</hi> of <hi>Sparta,</hi> only to the <hi>Nobles,</hi> that they might not be wholly depriv'd of the Reputation of Military Conduct, the ſituation of their Town inviting them more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over

Theſe Gentlemen have ſometimes Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments in <hi>Dalmatia;</hi> ſometimes the command of <hi>Groſs Companies,</hi> as their Service recommends them; beſides other Priviledges, as not to be arreſted for debt, to have a ſeat in the Colledg when Affairs are in debate, and to take place in the Towns where their Commands lye, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately next the <hi>Podeſta</hi> and the Captain at Arms.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Venetians</hi> chief Strength conſiſts in their Naval Force; and their thoughts are moſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd upon that, in reſpect of the Scituation of their Town, which is wholly in the Sea, and for
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50981:43"/>
defence of their <hi>Golf,</hi> and preſervation of thoſe Iſlands which they hold in the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> In my time there were only 25 Galleys, and four Galleaſſes, with a few Barks and <hi>Brigantins</hi> Armed, to ſecure their Coaſts; but they were able to ſet out twice the number, were their <hi>Arſenal</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with Slaves, Sea-men and Souldiers, as well as other neceſſaries. Their <hi>Arſenal</hi> is one of the fineſt things in <hi>Europe,</hi> and the beſt kept. It is a place of about three miles in compaſs, in the form <note place="margin">A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenal.</hi>
                     </note> of an Iſland. at one end of the Town, and on that ſide next the Main-Sea. It is wall'd about, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed with Canals that ſerve for ſo many Ditches. Within it there are three great Fountains or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatories which receive the water from the Sea, and communicate one with another upon occaſion. About them all three are an infinite number of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Houſes full of materials for Galleys, ſome made, ſome half made, others to be refitted, and all in their particular Magazins. For Example, one is full of Nails, another of all manner of Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work neceſſary for a Galley. Two are full of Small-ſhot, and Cannon-bullet; one of Planks, one with Rudders, one with Oars ready made, and two where they make them. There are two places for Cordage of 400 paces long, one for Hemp, another for Sailes, with a large Room full of Women to ſow them: one for Maſts, one for Pitch, one for Salt-Peter, and ſeveral for Powder. There are in it twelve Forges, or Smiths-ſhops, in which 100 men are continually working. Three <hi>Fonderies,</hi> or Rooms for running of their Lead. A great Hall for weighing their Cannon: a large Court full of Timber, Anchors, and Artillery, with about 800 Peeces of Cannon of all ſizes ranged in ſeveral Rooms. In a word, there are always Arms ready for 50000 men. The number of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

every day; the Tythes of the Clergy, the Sale of Offices, Confiſcations, and ſeveral other Incomes very conſiderable. So that in time of Peace the <hi>Senat</hi> lays up vaſt Sums, their Form of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> exempting them from the Expences of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, where all things are more Noble and Magnificent. 'Tis true, the State of <hi>Venice</hi> has more reaſon to lay up in time of Peace than any other Prince; there being none of them to whom their Wars are ſo Chargeable as to it, who for the moſt part is ſerv'd altogether for Money, with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no affection from thoſe they employ. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, their ordinary Revenue is not ſufficient to maintain their Wars; but when once they are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, they find out ways to ſupply themſelves by new Taxes, extraordinary Impoſitions upon the Nobility, Citizens, Eccleſiaſticks, and Mechanicks, by ſelling <hi>Nobility</hi> to the <hi>Populace,</hi> the Veſt of <hi>Procurator,</hi> the <hi>Golden-Stole,</hi> and all the great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to ſuch Lords as are ambitious; which ways, during the Wars of <hi>Cambray,</hi> brought into the Exchequer 500000 <hi>Ducats</hi> in eight months time. The <hi>Senat</hi> ſells likewiſe <hi>la Cittadinanza,</hi> or the Freedom of their City to Strangers, the Titles of <hi>Marqueſs</hi> and <hi>Count</hi> to the <hi>Nobles</hi> of the <hi>Terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firma:</hi> Liberty to Priſoners, Mercy to Criminals, Permiſſion to return to Baniſhed Perſons. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it takes Money at the rate of two or three <hi>per Cent.</hi> out of the Banks for Pious Uſes, as in that at <hi>Treviſan</hi> in the year 1669. It conſtrains the Rich to lend them, but eſpecially the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom they ſqueeze like ſpunges when they pleaſe, threatning to ſend them packing upon the leaſt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation. During the War of <hi>Candia,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Venice</hi> only, furniſhed the <hi>Senat</hi> with five or ſix Millions, and yet ſome few weeks before <hi>Candia</hi> was Surrendred, they made bold to draw
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50981:45"/>
Bills upon them for a conſiderable Sum more.</p>
                  <p>At the end of that War, if we may believe what was commonly reported in <hi>Venice,</hi> that <hi>Commonwealth</hi> was indebted above ſixty millions of <hi>Livres;</hi> and it was true: Yet a few years Peace will eaſily recover them, and put their affairs again into good condition; there being no Prince that ſpends leſs ſuperfluouſly than they, which Parcimony is to them as good as a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue <note n="*" place="margin">Parcimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt Vectigal.</note>. Beſides, their Officers who manage the publick Treaſure, having ſo many eyes upon them, and being to give account of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration to as many Judges as there are <hi>Nobles,</hi> 'tis impoſſible for them ſafely to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezzle it; for the Multitude, as they cannot diſſemble, ſo they never forgive; for the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacco di Caſſa,</hi> or purloining the Publick Money, is unpardonable at <hi>Venice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore, no payment is made, but it is firſt baloted, or authorized in the <hi>Pregadi;</hi> ſo that nothing paſſes out of the Coffers of their Exchequer, but upon good terms. When the ſum they owe is conſiderable, they pay it not all at one time, but by parcels and degrees, thereby to keep their Creditors in <hi>Venice,</hi> that before their ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, their firſt may be ſpent among them; and this practice is ſo frequently obſerv'd, that many times their Creditors are forced to renounce all and be gone, leſt their attendance ſhould conſume them. Beſides this, all their payments are made in <hi>Ducats,</hi> a <hi>Coin</hi> that cannot be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, it being of ſo baſe an allay, it would ſcarce give half the value out of that <hi>State;</hi> For this reaſon they are glad to change them at great loſs for Gold, or lay out their money in Commodities; ſo that it returns generally from whence it came, or at leaſt a great part of it.</p>

Again, the diſcovery of the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> by the <hi>Portugals</hi> in the year 1498, has been a great diminution to the Revenue of this <hi>Republick;</hi> for whereas all the Spices and Drugs from thoſe parts were brought by <hi>Aleppo</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to which places they were convey'd upon Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels backs, and from thence to <hi>Venice</hi> by Sea; as being at that time the Magazine for all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; Vaſquez de Gama</hi> found a way to bring them at much leſs charge by the <hi>Cape of good Hope;</hi> which has prejudiced the <hi>Venetians</hi> in their revenue to the value of 9 or 10 millions <hi>per ann.</hi> For then they ſet what price upon their goods they pleas'd; and they could do it, being the only people who ſupplied all <hi>Europe.</hi> And <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus</hi> did them as much miſchief <note place="margin">1490.</note> alone, by his diſcovery of the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> as all the <hi>Genois</hi> together in their ſeveral Wars; for by his Navigations he opened a way to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> and <hi>Portugais,</hi> who ſince then have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themſelves plentifully by Sea with ſuch Merchandize as before they were forc'd to buy of the <hi>Venetians</hi> at their own rate.</p>
                  <p>Let us now ſee what is objected by ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt the Conduct and Oeconomy of this <hi>State.</hi> Some blame <hi>their ſelling of Nobility as a diſhonourable thing:</hi> Others condemn <hi>the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant indulgence of the Senat towards their Prieſts, Monks, and Religious perſons:</hi> And others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim as much at <hi>their Stews, and the publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Courtiſans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>ſale of Nobility,</hi> 'tis abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, the ancient Families extinguiſhing every day; and if new ones ſhould not be ſubſtituted in their places, the Government would fall into an <hi>Oligarchy;</hi> by which it would be eaſie for the People to poſſeſs themſelves of the power,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50981:46"/>
and exclude the remainder of the <hi>Nobles.</hi> Beſides, the profit of this Sale is employed to the eaſe of the People, who would otherwiſe be over-laden with Impoſitions to ſupply the neceſſities of their Wars, did not the <hi>Senat</hi> rather chooſe this as a more mild and plauſible way to ſupply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of the Purſes of Rich men by a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Contribution. Again, hereby the People have the ſatisfaction to ſee their Friends and Relations ſharers in the Civil Adminiſtration, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by rendred better contented with what paſſes, and better inclin'd to the intereſt of their Country. Hence it follows that thoſe few Noblemen who are averſe to this new way of Creation, are not to be eſteem'd ſo good Citizens as they ought to be, in that they prefer their Paſſions and private Punctilios before the real Intereſt and Advantage of their State.</p>
                  <p>This was the Caſe of one of the <hi>Priuli,</hi> who profeſſed he had never, nor never would give his voice to any of thoſe Pretenders, it being, in his judgment, undecent to ſell their Nobility, which <note place="margin">The Book in which the names of all the <hi>Venetian</hi> Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are writ.</note> was to be conferr'd only upon Merit, and to put into * the <hi>Golden-Book</hi> the names of Artificers and Mechanicks. And it was wittily ſaid upon that occaſion by <hi>John Sagrede, That mixing their Silver with ſuch mean Allay, was no leſs Criminal than Coining.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Senat</hi>'s Indulgence to the <hi>Church-men,</hi> 'tis true it is too great, eſpecially to their <hi>Monks,</hi> who (as was well ſaid by <hi>Cardinal Elci</hi> during his <hi>Nunciature</hi> at <hi>Venice) had great need to have their Hoods taken ſhorter.)</hi> But by their kindneſs to them they ſecure themſelves againſt the effects of the Cenſures and Excommunications of <hi>Rome;</hi> for the <hi>Monks</hi> being ſenſible that no other Prince would allow them that liberty as they find in <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:50981:46"/>
where they live happily and contented, they make no great ſcruple to diſobey either his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or their <hi>General;</hi> againſt whoſe threats they oppoſe the favour and protection of that State, as the Shield of <hi>Achilles.</hi> Of this we have ſeen a fair Example in the <hi>Interdiction</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> V, which was obſerved by no body but the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> the <hi>Theatins,</hi> and a part of the <hi>Capuchins:</hi> for in ſpight of all the endeavours of the Pope's Party, who at <hi>Ferrara, Bologna,</hi> and <hi>Mantua,</hi> cried out againſt this <hi>Commonwealth</hi> as being <hi>Lutheran,</hi> ſpreading all over their State Seditious Libels, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing all their Marriages void, their Children illegitimate, and thouſand other things of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet the People went on, continued Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and enjoyed their Repoſe. Whereas had not the <hi>Monks</hi> been oblig'd to the State by their own proper Intereſt, at a time when the <hi>Pope</hi> was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by ſo many <hi>Boutefeux,</hi> eſpecially by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Monks</hi> might have diſpoſed the People to a Revolt, by declaiming againſt the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and ſeducing timerous Conſciences; which was a way whereby they have many times put <hi>Italy</hi> into a flame. So that the affection of their <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> ſtands the <hi>Senat</hi> in good ſtead, together with their Right, which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be preſerved by the common Intereſt of all the Princes in <hi>Europe.</hi> And it was eaſily preſaged at the beginning of that Affair, that the Iſſue would not be happy for the <hi>Pope;</hi> it being a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">See the Remarks.</note> ſaying, (alluding to the Coats of Arms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and the State of <hi>Venice) That the</hi> Borgian <hi>Dragon would not be able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power the</hi> Venetian <hi>Lion; and that though the Dragon fought deſperately with its Wings, yet the Lion would find wherewithal to defend it ſelf.</hi> To which they applied that Verſe of Scripture, <hi>Sub umbra alarum</hi>

                     <hi>tuarum,</hi> which the <hi>Venetians</hi> uſed then as their device, <hi>Pax tibi Marce,</hi> being their device only in time of Peace: and for this reaſon in time of War, or upon any vigorous preparation thereunto, the Book in their Eſcutcheon is ſhut.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Senat</hi> draws another Advantage from the licentiouſneſs of their <hi>Clergy,</hi> and that is to diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit them with the People, who as blind, and as corrupt as they are, can yet ſee their ignorance, and abhor their Debauches. So that their ill-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are not much to be feared, it being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the People would never hearken to them, or willingly follow the perſwaſion of thoſe for whom they have ſo little reſpect, or opinion of their Conduct in any Conſiderable Enterprizes: beſides, the <hi>Senat</hi> knows ſo well how to Coax them in time of War, that they Wheedle them out of vaſt Sums without violence or diſcontent; for they do not oblige them to Contribution by any Edict or Poſitive Decree, as they do the reſt of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but by ſuch Prayers and intimations of their Neceſſities, as they are not able to reſiſt <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>And as to the irregularity of the <hi>Nuns,</hi> 'tis an Inconvenience muſt neceſſarily be diſſembled, leſt they ſhould make deſperate ſo many young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen as the Nobility do daily force into their Covents, where they never would Profeſs, did they not find themſelves better accommodated than at home with their Parents. 'Tis true, none of them ought to be forc'd to that kind of Vocation; but if we conſider the inclination moſt young Women
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50981:47"/>
have to Liberty, their diſhonourable intrigues with their Servants, and their other impurities that would ſtain the Paper to deſcribe; we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the ſeverity of their Friends, who have not their hundreds of eyes to obſerve them; and thoſe poor Gentlewomen who never ſtir abroad, and who are depriv'd, by the Cuſtom of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, of all the Pleaſures and Divertiſement of their lives, ought in Equity to have ſome Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in their Cloiſters, and at leaſt to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the priviledg of ſeeing their Lovers at a Grate, when beſides what they ſee there, they ſee nothing but the walls of their Chamber.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, their Protection of <hi>Courteſans</hi> is an evil from whence the <hi>Senat</hi> receives great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, delivering themſelves thereby from the Care they muſt otherwiſe take of keeping their young Noblemen employed, who having nothing to do, would probably entertain themſelves in Deſigns againſt the State.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Courteſans</hi> are a kind of Leeches applied to ſuch Members as have too much blood. They are Spunges that ſuck up Forreign Moiſture, and are ſqueezed by the Magiſtrate when he ſees occaſion: for if they dreſs themſelves like Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or if they commit any other fault againſt the Law, the Officer <hi>des Pompes</hi> fines them ſo ſeverely, that they are many times forc'd to ſell all, and lie themſelves upon the ground.

                  <p>There is an ancient Emulation betwixt theſe two <hi>States,</hi> continued by the pretentions of the one, and the oppoſitions of the other: there being no <hi>Prince</hi> in all <hi>Italy</hi> that ſtands more upon their Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity than the <hi>Seigniory</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi> Nor is there any <hi>State</hi> but that in all <hi>Europe,</hi> which has exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their <hi>Clergy</hi> from participation of the Civil <hi>Government,</hi> or neglected to have <hi>Penſioners</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> they having made it a Maxim to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not to meddle in the <hi>Election</hi> of the <hi>Popes.</hi> To which may be added their detention of the

                  <p>THE <hi>Senat</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> is the better inclin'd to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> becauſe it fears nothing from him in <hi>Italy,</hi> where he has neither Reputation nor Eſtate.

                  </p>
                  <p>Upon his pretenſion to <hi>Friuli</hi> it is, that the <hi>Emperor</hi> pretends to the Nomination of the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Aquilea;</hi> which in truth remain'd in his Predeceſſors after the ſaid Province was engaged: But to prevent all manner of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,

the <hi>Senat</hi> has found out a way never to let it be vacant, by giving him who has the Title, power of chuſing a <hi>Coadjutor,</hi> which he never fails to do out of his own Family, and by that means keeping it conſtantly in being, the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> is defeated, and becomes utterly excluded from that Nomination.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Emperor,</hi> as he is <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Hungary,</hi> retains a right in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> which <hi>King Lad ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> engaged to the <hi>Venetians</hi> for 100000 <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats,</hi> though the <hi>Venetians</hi> pretend he ſold it out-right: However, that ſeems nor probable, for <hi>King Wincelaus</hi> demanded reſtitution of it during the Wars of <hi>Cambray,</hi> threatning <hi>Peter Paſqualigne</hi> their <hi>Embaſſador,</hi> to do himſelf juſtice with his Sword, if they would not do it without.

                  <p>THE <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> do not live in the ſame good intelligence as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> I. began the breach, by ſending home their Embaſſador <hi>Vincent Guſſoni</hi> upon occaſion of ſuccours they ſent to the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> for the defenſe of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat. Victor Amideus</hi> offended them likewiſe, by taking upon him the Title of <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Cyprus:</hi> And Duke <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> II. has been all his time at a diſtance, or rather in diſpute with them upon the ſame ſubject, and the ſuperſcription of the Letters from the <hi>Senat.</hi> The <hi>Count de Bigliore</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoys</hi> Embaſſador, having caus'd the Arms of <hi>Savoy</hi> quartered with the Arms of <hi>Cyprus</hi> to be ſet up over his Gate, the <hi>Senat</hi> ſent him word, if he caus'd them not immediately to be taken down, he ſhould ſee them taken down for him, and torn before his face. And the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador

was glad to ſubmit. One day Count <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip d'Aglie,</hi> a Knight of the <hi>Annonciade,</hi> raking too far into that ingrateful Matter, drew upon himſelf an unhappy Anſwer from <hi>Catarin Belegne</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſador; who told him, that <hi>his Maſters, the State of</hi> Venice, <hi>would be very glad if the Kingdom of</hi> Cyprus <hi>were in the Hands of his Highneſs the</hi> Duke <hi>of</hi> Savoy, <hi>and not in the Hands of the</hi> Turk; <hi>becauſe, if in his Highneſs's Hands, he was ſure his Maſters would be able by Force of Arms to recover it in two Months.</hi> Theſe alterations, and ſeveral others of a later date, by degrees broke all their Correſpondence; ſo that in the year 1670, the <hi>Senat</hi> called home their Embaſſador <hi>Francis Michieli,</hi> with which the <hi>Duke</hi> was offended, and more particularly with the ſaid Embaſſadors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal to ſend him one of his Pages, who had drawn his Sword againſt one of the <hi>Duke's</hi> Pages in his <hi>Anti-Chamber;</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Duke</hi> recalling in like manner his Embaſſador the <hi>Count de Bigliore</hi> from <hi>Venice,</hi> he departed the next morning after his Audience of <hi>Congy,</hi> that he might not receive the uſual Preſents of that <hi>Republick,</hi> and thereby ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify his Reſentment.</p>

                  <p>THE Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> is very ſolicitous of Friendſhip with the <hi>Venetian,</hi> and keeps commonly a Reſident in <hi>Venice.</hi> The <hi>Senat</hi> being reciprocally well-diſpoſed to the ſaid <hi>Prince,</hi> would willingly contribute to the reſtoring him to the Dutchy of <hi>Ferrara</hi> (ſo long in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his Anceſtors) if occaſion offer'd: For the <hi>Senat</hi> had much rather have the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> their Neighbour than the <hi>Pope,</hi> who ſome time or other may have a fancy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite the <hi>Poleſin</hi> with the Demeaſns of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> from which it was diſmembred under the <hi>Dukes</hi> of that Name. And <hi>Clement</hi> VIII had a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have done it. When the Houſe of <hi>Eſte</hi> was in poſſeſſion of this Dutchy, the <hi>Venetians</hi> had in <hi>Ferrara</hi> a Magiſtrate call'd <hi>Biſdomino,</hi> or <hi>Viſdomino,</hi> who alone adminiſtred Juſtice to all Subjects of that <hi>Republick,</hi> with the interpoſition of any of the <hi>Duke's</hi> Officers, according to agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt the ſaid <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Duke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the ſaid agreement, the <hi>Duke</hi> was oblig'd to make no Fortifications upon the River <hi>Po,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>Poleſin,</hi> which being an open Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey betwixt the <hi>Adige</hi> and the <hi>Po,</hi> would be <note place="margin">

were again in the hands of the Duke of <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> and if during the ſaid War, they would not grant him permiſſion to make uſe of the Troops they had ſent him, to ſtop the <hi>Barbarini</hi> in their paſſage into that Country, and to make an irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the Country of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> to reprize him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the loſſes of his Family; it was, becauſe they foreſaw it would beget a cruel and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous War in <hi>Italy,</hi> the blame of which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult upon them. And therefore the ſaid <hi>Duke</hi> could not prevail with the <hi>Senat,</hi> to procure that his pretenſions upon <hi>Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Commachio</hi> might be comprehended in the Treaty of Peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that propoſition being inſiſted upon, muſt neceſſarily have interrupted the whole Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about the buſineſs of <hi>Parma,</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of which depended the quiet and tranquility of all <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore, though the <hi>Venetian</hi> is not much troubled to ſee this <hi>Prince</hi> in the intereſts, and under the protection of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> they would have been better content he had ſtood <hi>Neuter;</hi> as fearing his Ambition to be great, may ſome time or other involve all <hi>Italy,</hi> as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in the time of Duke <hi>Francis,</hi> who join'd his Forces with the King of <hi>France</hi> for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> hoping that Crown would afterwards have given him all neceſſary aſſiſtance for the recovery of <hi>Ferrara:</hi> And this gives great Umbrage to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> for fear the <hi>French</hi> ſhould come to be their Neighbours.</p>

                  <p>The Profit the <hi>Venetian</hi> draws from their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the <hi>Turk</hi> is very great; for the <hi>Turks</hi> alone, as I have heard from ſeveral Merchants, do receive more Silks and Cloth of Gold from <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> than from all <hi>Europe</hi> beſides. And though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollander</hi> have made it their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to ſettle a Trade at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for Cloth, they could never effect it: the <hi>Turks</hi> finding them too fine, and of but little ſervice, compare them to painted Ladies, which look very well, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure the water.</p>

Theſe are all the Correſpondencies the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> holds with the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Europe;</hi> I have not mentioned <hi>Portugal,</hi> becauſe there is nothing of Commerce betwixt them.

                     <hi>Venice</hi> is one of the ſeven <hi>Priories</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> and comprehends 23 Commanderies, <hi>viz.

                  <p>The <hi>Venetian</hi> Correſpondencies being maintain'd by their Embaſſies, it is not amiſs in this place to ſay ſomething of their Cuſtom therein.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Senat</hi> maintains conſtantly an Embaſſador in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50981:64"/>
the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Court, and that place is commonly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by one of the Senators, cunning, eloquent, and well-vers'd in the Civil-Law, that in his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations he may be able to defend himſelf, and elude all the Artifices of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when any thing is in Controverſy betwixt them. Upon extraordinary occaſion they ſend four Embaſſadors Extraordinary, either Procurators of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> or of the Principal Senators. The <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat</hi> did the ſame Honour to <hi>Francis</hi> I, after the Battel of <hi>Marignan,</hi> and the four Embaſſadors were, <hi>Anthony Grimani,</hi> afterwards <hi>Duke, Dominick Treviſan, George Cornaro,</hi> and <hi>Andrew Gritti,</hi> all of them Procurators of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and Venerable for their years.</p>
                  <p>They have their Embaſſadors likewiſe in the Courts of <hi>France, Vienna,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which places are never vacant, leſt they ſhould prejudice their Affairs; and when any of the ſaid <hi>Kings</hi> come firſt to the Crown, they ſend two Embaſſadors Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary to Congratulate. But ſometimes they are too careleſs in theſe ſort of Formalities. In the year 1670 it was reſolved to ſend the <hi>Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, Catarin Belegne,</hi> and another, to the young <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was already in the fifth year of his Reign, with Complements of Condolence for the death of his Father, and Complements of Congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for his Acceſs to the Crown; ſo that the ſaid <hi>Prince</hi> would have had occaſion to have laugh'd at ſo prepoſterous an Embaſſy, as <hi>Tiberius</hi> did at the Embaſſy of the <hi>Trojans,</hi> to condole the Death of his Son <hi>Druſus.

To the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> the <hi>Seigniory</hi> ſends no Embaſſadors but when they have need of him, as in time of War; where it is remarkable by the by, that the Embaſſador at his Audience gives him the Title of <hi>Royal Highneſs,</hi> by which that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi> ſeems to acknowledg his lawful Right to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> which I objecting one day to the Secretary <hi>Auguſtin Bianchi,</hi> he told me, the Embaſſador gave him that Title out of his own civility, without any order from the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat,</hi> who conniv'd at it for the benefit of their Affairs during the War; <hi>E per queſto, ceſſante la Guerra, ceſſa l' Ambaſciaria, anzi la Corriſpondenza; And therefore,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>when the War ceaſes, their Embaſſies and Correſpondence ceaſe with it.</hi> And indeed not long after the War at <hi>Candia</hi> was at an end, there was an end of their Correſpondence.</p>
                  <p>The neighbouring <hi>Kings</hi> do reciprocally honour this <hi>Republick</hi> with Embaſſadors from them, not for any need they have of the <hi>Venetians</hi> in their Affairs, their Alliance being uſeleſs to them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Neutrality which they publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, but to gratify them in a thing they ſo ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire, becauſe the preſence of theſe Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors keeps up their Reputation in <hi>Italy,</hi> and holds thoſe <hi>Princes</hi> in reſpect; beſides, their own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects bear greater Veneration to their <hi>Government,</hi> ſeeing the deference paid them from the <hi>Kings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Embaſſies to <hi>Venice</hi> are commonly of no great importance to the Affairs of thoſe <hi>Princes</hi> that ſend them, the <hi>Senat</hi> applying wholly to Peace; and yet of all their Embaſſies they are the moſt difficult, and require the moſt cunning and ſagacity, becauſe they treat as it were with dumb People, and are to underſtand every thing by ſigns. Therefore it is that <hi>Venice</hi> is called <hi>the School and Touchſtone of Embaſſadors:</hi> for thither do Princes

ſend them to diſcover their Parts; and in this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy it was that <hi>Monſiegnior d' Aligre,</hi> the ſecond of that name, and preſent <hi>Chancellor</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> diſcovered to the late <hi>King</hi> his prudence and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, having executed that Office at a time when things were very intricate and perplex'd, in reſpect of the differences about the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> which was then poſſeſſed by the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the <hi>Italians,</hi> but particularly by the <hi>Venetian,</hi> who had the greateſt intereſt therein.</p>

                  <p>THE Magiſtrates of <hi>Venice</hi> are of three ſorts, the <hi>Domeſticks,</hi> whoſe Juriſdiction lies wholly in the Town, as thoſe in <hi>Rome,</hi> who were called <hi>Magiſtratus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbani;</hi> the <hi>Provincial Magiſtrates,</hi> whoſe adminiſtration is abroad; and the <hi>Military Officers,</hi> as the <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veditor General</hi> of the Sea, the <hi>General</hi> of the <hi>Gulf,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>The firſt are of two ſorts, one manages the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Government,</hi> as the <hi>Duke,</hi> the ſix Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, the <hi>Sage-Grands,</hi> and the <hi>Senators,</hi> like thoſe in <hi>Rome,</hi> called the <hi>Magiſtratus Majores.</hi> The others meddle only in matters of Judicature, and are ſo numerous, a third part of them are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.

                  <p>I do not pretend to ſet down the preciſe number of their Magiſtrates, which would be troubleſome and uſeleſs; I ſhall only ſpeak of thoſe who have the chiefeſt ſhare in the adminiſtration.

                  <p>THE <hi>Iſles</hi> under the <hi>Venetian</hi> Juriſdiction were govern'd at firſt by <hi>Conſuls,</hi> and then by <hi>Tribunes</hi> annually choſen, as I have hinted before. But the People growing weary of their delays, and particular quarrels, reſolution was taken, to create a <hi>Head,</hi> to whom the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes</hi> ſhould be obliged to be accountable.</p>
                  <p>To this end all the <hi>Iſles</hi> ſent their Deputies to <hi>Heraclea,</hi> to proceed in the Election of a <hi>Prince;</hi> and it was <hi>Lucius Anafeſtus</hi> that was choſen, to whom the People transferr'd their Soveraign power: but the <hi>Venetians</hi> refuſed to agree, alledging, that ſince the Foundation of their <hi>Republick</hi> they had always preſerv'd their Liberty, and never ſubmitted to any Authority, but the Authority of their Laws. <hi>Bodni, Jannoti, John Botetus,</hi> and ſome other eminent Writers, have ſpoken of the old Soveraignty of the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> as of an unqueſtionable thing. The Reader may judg of it by the following Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which I have extracted out of their own proper Annals.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Inveſtiture that <note n="*" place="margin">

Beſides, it belonged to him to call the Clergy and the People together, to proceed to their Elections; and if at any time they aſſembled without his Convocation, all the Elections were actually void.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Princes</hi> who ſent Embaſſadors to <hi>Venice,</hi> addreſs'd their Letters of Credence to the <hi>Duke</hi> only, as the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Pope Calixtus</hi> did to Duke <hi>Dominique Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieli.</hi> So that it was the opinion of all the <hi>Princes</hi> of that time, that the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute.</p>
                  <p>The ſaid <hi>Dominick Michieli</hi> refus'd the Crown of <hi>Sicily</hi> that was offered him, only becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Soveraign</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> and of ſeveral <hi>Provinces</hi> in the <hi>Levant,</hi> he feared to loſe the poſſeſſion of a <hi>State</hi> at that time more conſiderable (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as to Title) than <hi>Sicily:</hi> Whereas had his power been only precarious, and dependant upon the People, 'tis not probable he would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted ſo fair an occaſion of making himſelf a <hi>King.</hi> Beſides, what he did in <hi>Syria</hi> is a ſtrong Argument of his Soveraignty; for Money being ſhort, and his Soldiers mutining againſt him, he cauſed boiled Leather to be coined, called it by his own Name <hi>Michielette,</hi> commanded by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged Edict all the Sutlers and Victuallers of his Army to receive it upon pain of death, and promiſed to pay the value in Silver at his return, and they obey'd.

preſum'd they owned him for their Sovereign, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they truſted to his promiſe, which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would have done, had they not thought him able to have kept it; and how could he have been able, had he not been their <hi>King?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. 'Tis a mark of Sovereignty to apply confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Goods to his own uſe; but this the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> did, as appears by an Edict of <hi>Duke Peter Candian</hi> in the year 972, by which he prohibits all the Subjects of that <hi>State,</hi> to carry or convey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Turks</hi> any ſort of Arms offenſive or defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, under penalty of 100 <hi>Livres</hi> of Gold, to be applied to the uſe of him and his Succeſſors.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> have aſſociated in their <hi>Dukeſhip</hi> with their Children and Brothers, and by that means keeping it to their Families, have in a manner made it hereditary.

                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>Doges</hi> marry with Forreign Princeſſes, as <hi>Peter Candien,</hi> the fourth of that Name, did with the Daughter of <hi>Albert,</hi> Lord of <hi>Ravenna: Otho Orſeole</hi> with a Daughter of <hi>Stephen</hi> King of

Beſides, I do not ſee that theſe words, <hi>Cum Clero &amp; Populo; cum Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicibus &amp; Sapientibus; cum Populi Collaudatione &amp; Confirmatione,</hi> do at all prove the participation of the three Eſtates in the Civil <hi>Government.</hi> For by the ſame reaſon it may be argued the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> are not Abſolute there, becauſe all Ordon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances concluded with this form, <hi>By the King and his Council,</hi> which only ſhews that that <hi>King</hi> takes the advice of his <hi>Council</hi> before he reſolves in any matter of <hi>State.</hi> As to the words <hi>Collaudatione</hi> and <hi>Confirmatione,</hi> they ſignify nothing but the manner in which the Edicts of their <hi>Doges</hi> were received by the <hi>People,</hi> that is to ſay, with univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Applauſe: for if the word <hi>Confirmation</hi> be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken literally, and in the ſame ſenſe it is ſaid, the <hi>King</hi> has <hi>Confirm'd</hi> the Priviledges granted by his Predeceſſors to ſome Abby or Family: or that the <hi>Parliament</hi> has Confirm'd the Sentence of a <hi>Preſidial;</hi> it would be no leſs than to ſay the Authority of the <hi>People</hi> was greater than the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of either <hi>Doge, Clergy,</hi> or <hi>Nobility,</hi> becauſe it belonged to them to confirm all Deliberations, which the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who pretend their <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was never <hi>Popular,</hi> will never allow.</p>
                  <p>From whence I conclude the <hi>Collaudation</hi> and <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the People was nothing but an outward approbation, and obediential Concurrence to the Edicts of their <hi>Dukes.</hi> without being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, or any neceſſity of them to the <hi>Duke,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could execute any thing that was reſolved: and this is proved by the aforementioned words, <hi>hortantibus &amp; Conſentientibus nobis, &amp;c.</hi> For to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, is a kind of Prayer or Remonſtrance that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50981:69"/>
Subjects uſe towards their Sovereigns: and if the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Noblemen</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> gave their conſent ſometimes, it is not to be ſaid the <hi>Doge</hi> could not act without them, but rather that the <hi>Doge</hi> doing them the Honour to communicate with them in ſome things, their gratitude prompted them to a ready obedience.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Doges</hi> at any time cauſed their Orders or Decrees to be ſubſcribed by the <hi>Prelats</hi> of the <hi>Province,</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> of the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> it was one of their Artifices to paſs with more eaſe ſuch Edicts as they thought would be offenſive to the <hi>People,</hi> whom by that means they deſired to perſwade, that thoſe who ſign'd the Edicts, were Authors of them; and by this means the <hi>Doges</hi> did now and then ſhift off the <hi>Odium</hi> upon others.</p>
                  <p>At this day the Authority of the <hi>Duke</hi> is ſo limited, that he can do nothing without the <hi>Senat.</hi> For this cauſe, in publick Ceremonies where the <hi>Senat</hi> marches, there is always following the <hi>Doge</hi> a Nobleman, who carries a <hi>Sword</hi> in the <hi>Scabbard</hi> before the <hi>Senat,</hi> to ſignify that the whole Power and Authority of the <hi>State</hi> is in the hands of the <hi>Senat.</hi> For as the <hi>Conneſtable,</hi> or <hi>Grand Eſcuier</hi> carries the <hi>Sword</hi> before the <hi>French King</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he makes his Entry into any conſiderable Town, to ſhew the abſoluteneſs of his Power over his Subjects; ſo, on the contrary, 'tis an evident mark that the <hi>Doge</hi> is ſubject both to the <hi>Laws</hi> and the <hi>Senat,</hi> that the <hi>Sword</hi> is carried after him, and hangs as it were over his head, to admoniſh him that if he tranſgreſs his duty in the leaſt, he is not to expect better treatment than was uſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Marin Falier</hi>

and carried ſeveral Families away with them, the <hi>Nunt io Pompeius Vareſus</hi> came to the <hi>Colledg,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining in the name of the <hi>Pope,</hi> that the <hi>Seigniory</hi> had ſuffered thoſe <hi>Corſairs</hi> to paſs into the <hi>Gulfi</hi> without fighting them, notwithſtanding their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to do it.

                     <hi>if thoſe Infidels entred ſo boldly into the Territories of the Church, it was becauſe they found them ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded (not to ſay deſerted) whilſt the</hi> Pope<hi>'s Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys were employed upon particular ſervice, when they ſhould have been left in his Harbours for ſecurity of his Towns, and defence of his Subjects.</hi> An anſwer that ſtop'd the <hi>Nunt io</hi>'s mouth.</p>

That the</hi> Senat <hi>could not Revoke what they ſo juſtly had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; that he did not think it an encroachment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Priviledges of the Religious (who were as much under the Protection of their</hi> Government <hi>as the reſt) to oblige them to publick Offices, as Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi>

                  <p>Theſe two Anſwers were generally lik'd, becauſe they were as they ought to be, and the ſecond ſeemed approv'd even at <hi>Rome,</hi> for the <hi>Nunt io</hi> not being with the <hi>Senat</hi> in the firſt Proceſſion of the Religious upon St. <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s-day, becauſe he would not countenance that Novelty with his preſence; not long after he received Orders to be preſent at all the reſt, to the aſtoniſhment of all the World, which rather expected from his <hi>Holineſs</hi> ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of diſpleaſure and reſentment againſt that <hi>State.</hi>

                  <p>As to the Offices performed by Embaſſadors to the <hi>Colledg,</hi> to ſignify the joy or affection of their Maſters, the <hi>Doge</hi> in thoſe caſes has liberty to ſay as he pleaſes, thoſe ſort of Anſwers being only Complemental, and draw no ill conſequence after them.</p>

The <hi>Doge</hi> being chief in all Councils, 'tis his right to propoſe every thing to all the Principal Magiſtrates; he propoſes all buſineſs of importance to the <hi>Grand Council,</hi> in which he has a double Voice; to the <hi>Pregadi;</hi> as the <hi>Sages-Grans;</hi> the <hi>Council of Ten;</hi> as the three <hi>Capi-Dieci;</hi> in which he is ſomething more than the Preſident of the <hi>Senat</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi> who never ſate but in the <hi>Senat.</hi>

                  <p>Thus have I ſhewn preciſely, in what the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> conſiſts. Let us now turn the Medal, and ſee where lies his Inferiority and Subjection. The <hi>Duke</hi> cannot ſtir out of <hi>Venice,</hi> but by permiſſion of the Councel; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he incurs the diſpleaſure of the <hi>Senat,</hi> and expoſes himſelf to a thouſand inſolencies, againſt which he can look for no reparation; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an expreſs Law that gives liberty to any one to throw ſtones at him in that caſe. Out of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> he is no more than another <hi>Senator;</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives no publick honour; it not being with him as it was with <hi>Pompey,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi Pompeius, ibi Roma; where he was, there was the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Rome.</hi> On the contrary, the <hi>Doge</hi> is always where the <hi>Seigniory</hi> is, but the <hi>Seigniory</hi> is not always with the <hi>Doge:</hi> If any diſorder ſhould happen where he was abroad, he could not take cognizance of it, nor apply any reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; it would belong to the <hi>Podeſta,</hi> as being a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50981:73"/>
publick Officer inveſted with Authority to that purpoſe: whereas the <hi>Duke</hi> would be wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted, and as a member cut off from the body, quite incapable of any Function or Office. By this means they take from the <hi>Duke</hi> all deſire of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting from <hi>Venice,</hi> which being as it were the Helm of that <hi>Government,</hi> his Preſence is always neceſſary to manage it, and give Example to the reſt of the <hi>Nobles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Brothers</hi> are excluded all the principal Offices of <hi>State</hi> during his life: they can neither be of the <hi>Colledg;</hi> of the <hi>Council of Ten;</hi> Chiefs of the <hi>Quarenty Criminal, Avogadors, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, Proveditors General</hi> at <hi>Sea,</hi> thereby making a juſt counterpoiſe of his Power, by debaſing his Family: they cannot make Addreſſes for any Biſhoprick, Abby, or other Benefice, to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor accept them, though freely offered by the <hi>Pope.</hi>

                  <p>In the year 1622 Cardinal <hi>Matthew Priuli</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the Biſhoprick of <hi>Bergamo,</hi> to which he was named by <hi>Gregory</hi> XV, becauſe his Father <hi>Duke Anthony</hi> was living. Cardinal <hi>Frederick Cornaro</hi> did the ſame when the rich Biſhoprick of <hi>Padua</hi> was given him by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII, who was highly diſobliged thereby, and would have had him taken it, in ſpight of the Laws of his Countrey, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the <hi>Senat.</hi> For the <hi>Cardinalſhip</hi> there is particular exception, and the <hi>Senat</hi> declared it was not comprehended under the word Benefices, at the promotion of the ſaid <hi>Cornaro.</hi> So that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> may ſay with <hi>Antonius Pius,</hi> (though in a different ſenſe,) <hi>Poſtquam ad imperium tranſivimus, etiam quae prius habuimus, perdidimus.</hi> Capit. <hi>in</hi> Anton. Hence it is that many of the Nobility who have had <hi>Dukes</hi> of their Family, avoid nothing more than that Honour; and yet
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50981:74"/>
they are forced to accept it, unleſs they have a mind to be baniſhed, and forfeit their Eſtates. In this manner they forced the <hi>Dukeſhip</hi> upon <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas Contarini</hi> during their Wars with <hi>Genoa,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Marc-Anthony Treviſan</hi> in the laſt age, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Francis Cornaro</hi> ſince, who died of pure anger eight days after his Election. That which is more ſtrange is, that this <hi>Republick</hi> after the conſtant good ſervice of their <hi>Dukes,</hi> make no ſcruple to depoſe them upon any ſickneſs or infirmity, as if their age or indiſpoſitions were ſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the memory of their former deportment, though never ſo good. With this ingratitude they recompenced the merits of <hi>Francis Foſcaro,</hi> to whom they would not allow him to die, though he was 84 years of age, and in his <hi>Dukeſhip</hi> had acquir'd to his Countrey the Towns of <hi>Breſſia, Bergamo, Crema,</hi> and <hi>Ravenna,</hi> as is to be ſeen in his Epitaph. Yet this ſeverity has one good effect upon the <hi>Dukes,</hi> that in ſtead of pretending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ill, to avoid the fatigues of their Office, they will aſſiſt at all publick Ceremonies, though they be ready to die. And if he fails at certain Feaſts, and appears not with the <hi>Senat,</hi> 'tis immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſuppoſed he is dead, and many times they have no news of his death till they hear of his Funeral.</p>
                  <p>Formerly ſeveral <hi>Dukes</hi> have reſign'd, and laid by their Dignity, to die in repoſe, as <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Orſo Participatio; Peter Orſeole; Sebaſtian,</hi> and <hi>Peter Ziani;</hi> one <hi>Maliepiere,</hi> and <hi>James Contarin:</hi> but now 'tis not permitted, the <hi>Venetians</hi> declaring, <hi>That a man born in a Commonwealth, and having ſhare in the Affairs, ought never to be wanting to his Countrey, whilſt he is in a condition to ſerve it: that it belongs not to a particular man to quit his Country, but to his Country to quit him, if it finds him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable:</hi>

                  <p>The Wives of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Sparta</hi> were not treated as <hi>Queens,</hi> nor allowed any thing for their ſupport from the Publick.

                  <p>In the mean time the difference is very great betwixt the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> and the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Sparta.</hi> The <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Sparta</hi> had two ſorts of Command, one at home, which indeed was very ſtreight; the other abroad in their Wars, which was more large. The <hi>Senat</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> clip'd the wings of their <hi>Dukes</hi> in the ſecond point in the year 1645 after the death of <hi>Duke Francis Erizza,</hi> ordaining <hi>that no</hi> Duke <hi>ſhould be choſen General at Land nor at Sea, nor any of their Brothers or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren during their Dukeſhip.</hi> Which ſerv'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the report at that time, that the <hi>Senat</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found the danger they had pulled upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the large Power they had given to <hi>Duke Erizza,</hi> had poiſoned him as he was ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>

alter a ſyllable of what is decreed by the <hi>Grand Council</hi> and the <hi>Senat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a word, the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains their <hi>Dukes</hi> Priſoners in their Palace, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd with Spies and Informers, deſtitute of common divertiſements, and diveſted of all the Authority of <hi>Princes;</hi> but it daily retrenches their Priviledges, to vilifie them the more. Formerly, the Preſents ſent them from the <hi>Levant,</hi> or other Countries where it was the Cuſtom to ſend them by their Embaſſadors, belong'd to the <hi>Dukes.</hi> In the 1668, the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Embaſſadors in their return from <hi>France,</hi> paſſing by <hi>Venice,</hi> where they had ſomething to negotiate for the intereſt of their Maſter, preſented the <hi>Doge</hi> to the value of Ten or Twelve Thouſand Crowns in Sables and other Furrs. The Procurator <hi>Andreas Contarin,</hi> a <hi>Sage-Grand,</hi> nearly related to the <hi>Duke</hi> of that Name, but a mortal Enemy to the Procurator his Son, who had made himſelf odious to all the Nobles by his abominable avarice; remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to the <hi>Grand Council, That the Preſents of the</hi> Muſcovites <hi>ought not to be appropriated to the</hi> Doge; <hi>for he being no Soveraign, neither the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors nor Preſents were ſent to him, any more than he ſent their Embaſſadors:</hi> Adding, <hi>That when their Embaſſadors carried Preſents to</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, <hi>it was not at the charge of the</hi> Doge, <hi>and therefore it was not reaſonable that he ſhould have the profit of what belong'd in Juſtice to the Publick, which defrayed the charge of the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.</hi> And the buſineſs coming to a debate, it was ſolemnly decreed, that for the future the <hi>Doge</hi> and his Succeſſors ſhould be deprived of that ancient advantage.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Doge</hi> appears in any publick Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Ceremony, he is magnificently cloathed,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50981:77"/>
ſometimes in Cloth of Gold, ſometimes in Cloth of Silver, and ſometimes in Scarlet, with the <hi>Ducal-Corne.</hi> upon his head, the uſhers of his houſhold marching before him, and two of them carrying his Train: The <hi>Captain-Grand</hi> marches likewiſe before him with his Officers, the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> and <hi>Grand-Chancellor</hi> with the <hi>Golden-Stole,</hi> and after him follows the <hi>Senat.</hi> In this Equipage he draws the Eyes, and forces Veneration from the People, who are always taken with the outward tokens of Grandure. But it is to be obſerved, the <hi>Senat</hi> follows not in addition to his Honor, but to participate of what is given him where-ever he goes; believing that if the <hi>Duke</hi> ſhould receive it alone, he would appear a Soveraign to the People, and to ſuch ſtrangers as were preſent.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> like not that their <hi>Duke</hi> ſhould have too much parts, they believe that would make him leſs tractable, and give him a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in himſelf.

                  <p>They make him <hi>Duke</hi> for his life, to render him more Majeſtick, and like to the Crowned Heads, among whom they are willing he ſhould be reckoned; as alſo to coax him for the little Power he has, by the Duration of his Dignity: but they chooſe him always antient, that other pretenders may have hopes to ſucceed.

                  <p>They are very glad when their <hi>Dukes</hi> are rich, that they may adorn their dignity, and be an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to the Publick, which allows them not above 12000 Crowns <hi>per annum,</hi> half of which is ſpent in his four annual Feaſts: To which may be added the charge of his entrance, which is never well celebrated but by large Gifts to the people thrown among them in Silver in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of St. <hi>Mark;</hi> a Cuſtom firſt introduced by Duke <hi>Sebaſtian Ziani.</hi> So that if they have any touch of Generoſity and Magnificence, they do often incommode, if not ruine their Families: And that is it the <hi>Senat</hi> deſires, having perhaps no other deſign in exempting their Children from the penalty of their Sumptuary Laws.</p>
                  <p>The Adminiſtration of their <hi>Dukes</hi> is looked into after their deaths by <hi>three</hi> Inquiſitors, and <hi>five</hi> Correctors created on purpoſe, who always find that either the <hi>Duke</hi> has abuſed his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſome more ſome leſs; or neglected the Publick affairs for the advancement of his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; or elſe that he has not lived according to his quality. And this canvaſing of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50981:78"/>
is commonly followed by the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Heir in ſome Pecuniary Mulct; ſo that their Children cannot enjoy their Inheritance, till they have obliged themſelves by Oath to pay what Impoſition ſhall be laid upon them. Thus was the Family of the <hi>Duke Peter Loredan</hi> charged with a Fine of 1500 <hi>Sequins,</hi> becauſe the Father had lived too narrowly in his <hi>Dukeſhip.</hi> In my time they found the like fault with their <hi>Duke,</hi> who beſides his own parſimony, had a Son who took what-ever he could lay his hands upon, as if to make amends for the old age of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which appeared the worſe, becauſe the <note place="margin">

                  <p>And yet this Cuſtom hinders not, but that great Honors are paid to them after their death. Their Funerals are ſolemnized with great Pomp at the charge of the <hi>State.</hi> Their Funeral Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons pronounced formally in the Church of St. <hi>Mark;</hi> an Honor the Law did not formerly allow, and which began but ſince the death of <hi>Andreas Contarin.</hi> They fix upon their Vaults a Scutcheon with their Armes, in memory of their <hi>Dukeſhip,</hi> which was introduced at the Obſequies of <hi>Duke Marin Moroſini.</hi> And laſt of all it is permitted to ſet up noble and rich Tombes for them. But that which is ſingular in their Funerals, is, that the <hi>Senat</hi> attends the Corps in their Robes of <note place="margin">

cannot be choſen <hi>Councellor</hi> of the Caſtle, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Lords are called <hi>Councellors</hi> of the <hi>Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niory,</hi> becauſe with the <hi>Doge</hi> they repreſent the Body of the <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> They are called like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Conſiglieri di Sopra,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from the <hi>Conſiglieri d' Abaſſo,</hi> who Preſide in the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty Criminel,</hi> in ſtead of the <hi>Seigniory</hi> which ſate formerly there.

                  <p>The <hi>Councellors</hi> of the <hi>Seigniory</hi> have two Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, one publick, the other private.

To receive all Petitions <hi>Cognoſcible</hi> in the <hi>Grand Council;</hi> to examine them among themſelves, and to tear them in pieces if they do not like them. To grant Priviledges and Exemptions. To appoint Judges to both Parties, when the Controverſy is about Juriſdiction: and, in ſhort to reſolve when the <hi>Council</hi> is to be called extraordinarily. The firſt, that is to ſay, their Publick Office, is to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in all <hi>Councils;</hi> to diſpatch all neceſſary Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (during the <hi>Interregnum)</hi> to the <hi>Podeſtats, General</hi> of their <hi>Armies, Proveditors</hi> at <hi>Land</hi> or at <hi>Sea;</hi> and, in a word, to all the Officers of <hi>State.</hi>

When Relations have any Conteſt among them, and deſire extraordinary Judges, 'tis in the power of the <hi>Duke</hi> and the <hi>Councellors</hi> of the <hi>Seigniory</hi> to appoint them; and the ſaid deputed Judges, by vertue of a Commiſſion confirmed by the <hi>Grand Council,</hi> determine definitively.

                  <p>It is forbidden to the <hi>Councellors,</hi> Heads of the <hi>Quaranty Criminel, Sages</hi> of the <hi>Colledg,</hi> and <hi>Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadors,</hi> to be preſent at any Weddings, unleſs it be of their Children, Brothers.

The other is, becauſe theſe <hi>Lords</hi> having direction of the principal Affairs, and the whole care of the <hi>Government</hi> upon them, the publick Service would be retarded or neglected by

ſuch kind of Feſtivities, and they hindred in their attendance at the Palace, which might be of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence.</p>
                  <p>When one of theſe <hi>Councellors</hi> time is expiring, he ſwears his Succeſſor (a month before he enters into his Charge) to the obſervation of his <hi>Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lair,</hi> which he reads over to him for his inſtruction in the duties of his place, ſhewing him that all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees revokable ſince five years, or that paſt only for a certain time, are of no obligation: and if by any impediment the new <hi>Councellor</hi> has not taken his Oath from his Predeceſſor, he takes it before the <hi>Seigniory,</hi> in this form.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Procurators</hi> of St. <hi>Mark</hi> deſire this Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with much earneſtneſs, thereby adding Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to their Dignity, which has more of Title than Power.</p>
                  <p>Formerly the <hi>Sage-Grans</hi> managed and repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Affairs of the <hi>Terra-firma</hi> as well as the <hi>Sages</hi> of the <hi>Terra-firma,</hi> but of late that Order has been changed, to leſſen the Authority of the firſt, and to advance the latter.</p>
                  <p>The Ordinary Embaſſadors ſent by this <hi>State</hi> to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> are always ſtiled <hi>Sage-Grans</hi> in their Credentials, though perhaps they have not gone thorough that Office, nor cannot before their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.

                  <p>The <hi>Sage-Grans</hi> are not choſen like the reſt of the Magiſtrates, by the <hi>Grand Council,</hi> but by the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> who elect three at a time, every three months.

                  <p>THere are <hi>five Sages</hi> called Sages <hi>de terra firma,</hi> created firſt about the year 1340, after this <hi>Republick</hi> had acquir'd <hi>la Marca Trevigiana.</hi> One of them is call'd <hi>Sanio alla Scrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura;</hi> whoſe buſineſs it is to Liſt Soldiers, to Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter them, and to Continue or Caſhier them. He is treated with upon all Levies of Men: He reports to his Colleagues, and with them deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berates what is to be propoſed to the <hi>Colledg:</hi> He is Judge in Appeal of all Sentences paſſed, either within the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> or without, againſt any Souldier belonging to that <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> and determines definitively both Civil and Criminal Matters relating to the Souldier.</p>
                  <p>There is another of theſe <hi>Sages</hi> called <hi>Savio Caſſiere,</hi> who orders the payment of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and all others who have money to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> and nothing is paid without an Order ſigned by this <hi>Sage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The three other have neither Title nor Buſineſs peculiar, only they conſult jointly with the ſaid two, whoſe places they ſupply in caſe of abſence or ſickneſs, but with the Title of <hi>Vice-Sage Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiere, Vice-Sage Scrittura:</hi> Their Office continues only for ſix months like the <hi>Sages-Grans.</hi> In Winter they wear their Robe of Purple Cloth, and in Summer a Black watered-Camlet, with wide Sleeves: They are choſen likewiſe by the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> but without deliberative voices, in which they are much inferior to the <hi>Sages-Grans,</hi> and yet they have the Title of Excellence given them:</p>

                  <p>THere are likewiſe <hi>Five Sages</hi> commonly called <hi>Sages des Orders,</hi> who are young Noblemen of Principal Quality; admitted into the <hi>Colledg,</hi> not to deliberate for they have no voices, but to hear, and adapt themſelves to the Government by the example of the other <hi>Sages,</hi> whom they reſpect as their Maſters; and therefore when they ſpeak to the <hi>Colledg,</hi> they are obliged to be ſtanding and uncovered. 'Tis probable upon that account they are called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges des Orders,</hi> becauſe they are to obey the Orders of the <hi>Sages Grans,</hi> and <hi>Sages de Terra Firma,</hi> who have Power to exclude them from their reſpective Aſſemblies, when any affair of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance is before them that requires their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry: Whereas the <hi>Sages des Orders</hi> have no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg to exclude the other <hi>Sages</hi> from their Conſultations, nor to exclude them from their Maritime tranſactions which are all under their Cognizance, and therefore they are called moſt properly <hi>Sages de Mer.</hi>

                  <p>This exorbitant number of <hi>Procurators</hi> was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by the death of ſeveral of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to <hi>Nine,</hi> whom the <hi>Council</hi> declared <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curators</hi> in Ordinary, though of the <hi>Nine Six</hi> were Extraordinary.

Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Siege of <hi>Candia</hi> there were no leſs than <hi>Forty,</hi> ſome of them being of the New Nobility paid 70000 <hi>Ducats</hi> for their Places, whereas the Antient paid not above 30000 at moſt: The <hi>Commonwealth</hi> making it a Maxim to favour the Antient Nobility, and to ſqueeze the New, as having more juice for the generality than the other.</p>
                  <p>But of all theſe <hi>Procurators</hi> there are only <hi>Nine</hi> in Ordinary, called by the People <hi>Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators par meriti,</hi> whoſe Places are filled up af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Deaths, according to the Decree in the

year 1572. For when any of theſe <hi>Nine</hi> are dead, the Bell called <hi>la Trottiere</hi> (deſigned only to aſſemble the <hi>Grand Council)</hi> is rung, and the Defunct is not Buried till his Succeſſor be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen; to prevent Diſorders that may be cauſed by multitude of Competitors.</p>
                  <p>The new <hi>Procurator</hi> appoints a day for the Solemnity of his Entry, according to antient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, and all his Relations and Friends come home to his Houſe to attend him, firſt to the Church of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> where he hears <hi>Maſs,</hi> accompanied by the antient <hi>Procurator,</hi> who in Honour to him, gives him the Right-hand that day: He is followed by the reſt, as alſo by the <hi>Senators,</hi> and other Gentlemen invited, who march two and two in their Scarlet Robes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Maſs</hi> being done, he ſwears upon the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts</hi> to obſerve exactly his <hi>Capitulaire,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote with all his power the Worſhip of God, and the Advancement of the Publick intereſt; after which he enters into the <hi>Colledg,</hi> where having ſaluted the <hi>Seigniory</hi> three times, he goes up to the <hi>Councellors</hi> Seat, and places him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf next under the laſt of the three <hi>Chiefs of the Quarantie Criminel.</hi> The reſt of the <hi>Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators</hi> place themſelves above the <hi>Sages-Grans;</hi> and the reſt of the Nobility without Order, as they pleaſe themſelves. There it is he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the great Honour done him by the <hi>State,</hi> in whoſe name the <hi>Doge</hi> replies, commending modeſtly his Parts, or his Services, wiſhing him long enjoyment of his new Dignity. After this, he receives the Keys of the Chamber deſigned for him, which are preſented to him in a Purſe of Crimſon-Velvet by one of the <hi>Gaſtaldes,</hi> or Farmers of the Company: Then he takes another Oath upon an old Record the <hi>Grand Chancellor,</hi>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:50981:87"/>
holds in his hand to that purpoſe, and ſo departing from the <hi>Colledg,</hi> he takes poſſeſſion of his Charge.</p>
                  <p>Formerly theſe <hi>Procurators</hi> were in ſo great eſteem quite thorow <hi>Italy,</hi> that from all parts they ſent their young Gentlemen to <hi>Venice,</hi> to be brought up in puſillage under them: and ſeveral Princes and great Perſons falling ſuddenly ill in their paſſage that way, committed all that was moſt precious and valuable about them, to their cuſtody, as Perſons above all covetouſneſs or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. So that this <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> was inſtituted partly to undertake the tuition of <hi>Orphans;</hi> to ſettle the Affairs of thoſe who had no <hi>Guardians;</hi> to regulate the Eſtates of thoſe who died Inteſtate, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue; to ſee the Wills of other Perſons per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and, in ſhort, to keep good Order and <hi>Decorum</hi> betwixt Family and Family.</p>
                  <p>Upon this ſcore it was that all the <hi>Procurators</hi> were excommunicated by the two <hi>Nuntio's</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ardenaro Largo &amp; Falcone Ceſaraei.</note> ſent on purpoſe to <hi>Venice</hi> by <hi>Pope John</hi> XXII, in the year 1322, to recover ſuch Moneys as had been left to the Apoſtolick Chamber by certain Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Trading into the <hi>Levant;</hi> to the moſt part of whoſe Wills, the ſaid <hi>Procurators</hi> being left Executors, they had refuſed to pay the ſaid Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the ſaid <hi>Prelats,</hi> upon pretence that they would keep it for the Children, whoſe Fathers had never left it to the <hi>Pope,</hi> but in fear of being damn'd if they reſtored not as much as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal amounted to of all the Goods they had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried of their own into the <hi>Levant.</hi> For the <hi>Monks</hi> and the <hi>Friers</hi> had put it into their heads when <note place="margin">

                     </note> they were dying, without ſo doing they were not capable of Abſolution. And if this Reſtitution ſhould accrew to the profit of the <hi>Pope,</hi> as by a Bull of <hi>Clem.</hi> V. 1307, it would manifeſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50981:88"/>
to the deſtruction of their Families, and the ruine of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Trade, had not the <hi>Senat</hi> interpoſed for the prevention of ſo great an evil.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Procurators</hi> have the care and direction of the publick Alms, and can diſpoſe of them as they pleaſe, either to Hoſpitals, Monaſteries un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endowed, poor Criminals, diſcharge of Debtors, or Redemption of ſuch as are Subjects of that <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> and in captivity to the <hi>Turk.</hi> So as properly theſe <hi>Procurators</hi> are the common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of all People in diſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Procurators</hi> are never ſent Embaſſadors in Ordinary; in whick thing the <hi>Republick</hi> receives conſiderable prejudice by the multitude of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curators</hi> advanced to that Dignity for their Money, who might otherwiſe be uſeful to their Country, and appear with luſtre in the Courts of Forreign Princes, were they not adorned with a Robe that exempts them: for the <hi>Senat</hi> wanting many times Perſons that are rich and powerful (like the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curators)</hi> to ſupply thoſe Embaſſies, are conſtrain'd to ſerve themſelves with ſuch Noblemen as being low in their Fortunes, would ruine themſelves ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely in the very neceſſary Expence, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour their Character if they ſhould not.</p>
                  <p>They have their Palace, as I ſaid before, in the Place of St. <hi>Mark;</hi> but becauſe there is room only for <hi>ſix,</hi> (their old Houſes being inhabited only by Citizens) the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> allows the reſt a Penſion of 60 <hi>Sequins,</hi> till there be a place vacant, to which each of them comes in his turn, as well the <hi>Procurator</hi> created for his Money, as he that is preferr'd for his merit, according to the Order of their reception.</p>
                  <p>They have likewiſe their <hi>Council-Chamber</hi> in St. <hi>Mark,</hi> where they meet every <hi>Tueſday, Thurſday</hi>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:50981:88"/>
and <hi>Saturday.</hi> And becauſe the <hi>Library</hi> is near thoſe Chambers, they have the direction thereof, and the nomination of the <hi>Ducal-Chairs,</hi> as they call them, eſtabliſhed for the publick teaching of <hi>Philoſophy, Law,</hi> and <hi>Phyſick.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> is always ſupplied by a Nobleman, with a Penſion of 500 <hi>Ducats;</hi> and in my time it was <hi>John Babtiſto Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarini</hi> a Senator. The other <hi>two</hi> are ſupplied by Citizens of <hi>Venice,</hi> with Penſions likewiſe from the Publick.</p>
                  <p>The Univerſity of <hi>Padua</hi> is under the direction of two <hi>Procurators,</hi> called <hi>Reformatori dello ſtudio di Padua,</hi> and their Office reſembles the Office of the <hi>Provost</hi> of <hi>Sorbon.</hi> It belongs to theſe <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matori</hi> to take notice of all <hi>Books</hi> Printed in that <hi>State,</hi> and to take care they be not expoſed to ſale, till the <hi>Stationers</hi> have given ſuch Copies as are to be put into the publick <hi>Libraries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Dignity of <hi>Procurator</hi> is for life, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Senat</hi> preſumes to degrade them: the laſt Age furniſhes us with two Examples, the one in <hi>Anthony Grimani,</hi> who was reſtored after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and created <hi>Doge:</hi> the other two in <hi>James Sorance,</hi> who was deprived of that Honour, and baniſhed into <hi>Iſtria.</hi> And of late years <hi>Francis Moroſini</hi> was in a fair way of being treated in that manner, though the <hi>Grand Council</hi> had given him the Robe with exceſſive teſtimony of the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they received in his Services, creating in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular favour for him, a tenth place for the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curators by Merit;</hi> which had never been known before.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Procurators</hi> are habited in Black or Violet, with Ducal-ſleeves, and the <hi>Stole</hi> black: but if they be <hi>Sages-Grans,</hi> they wear them of Purple. Upon their grand Ceremonies, as on the day of their Entry, the Feaſt of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and ſome
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50981:89"/>
others, they put on a Robe of Crimſon-Velvet, and their <hi>Stole</hi> of Gold, if they be Knights.</p>
                  <p>Next to the <hi>Procurators</hi> are the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led commonly the <hi>Council of Ten.</hi>

                  <p>In the firſt age of its eſtabliſhment, its Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity extended not far; for the <hi>Quarantie Criminel</hi> which is much ancienter, judged in all Criminal matters, and in ſeveral other things. But by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the <hi>Ten</hi> rendred themſelves ſo conſiderable, that by their addreſs they got the cogniſance of all <hi>Crimes</hi> againſt the <hi>States,</hi> as <hi>Seditions, ill-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, Coining</hi> of falſe <hi>Money, Aſſaſſinations</hi> committed by Noblemen, <hi>Sodomy,</hi> and ſometimes of <hi>Hereſy</hi> it ſelf.

Nor do we want Inſtances of ſeveral Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations undertaken and perfected by the <hi>Council of Ten,</hi> in defiance of the whole <hi>Pregadi.</hi> Witneſs <note place="margin">Jannot <hi>de Rep.

                  <p>But at preſent the Authority of the <hi>Ten</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to <hi>Criminal Cauſes,</hi> and as there is no Court in the World where the Judges proceed with more ſeverity againſt Perſons accuſed, it will not be amiſs to ſay ſomething of their Methods in this place.</p>
                  <p>After the three <hi>Capi-Dieci,</hi> who are the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Preſidents,</hi> have received the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes in Writing; and have perfectly inſtructed themſelves in all the circumſtances of the Fact, they cauſe the accuſed Perſon to be ſecured pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, and examined by the Chief for that Week; whoſe Anſwers are taken by a Clerk or Regiſter, and by him communicated with his two Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues, and their advice taken thereupon; after which, the Cauſe is carried by them to the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> where they all <hi>three</hi> do manage the Accuſation againſt the Malefactor, urging his Confeſſion againſt him; and this they do, whilſt the poor Criminal is not allowed to plead his own Cauſe, nor to retain Counſel, nor to ſee any of his Friends or Relations,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50981:90"/>
or ſo much as to receive a Letter from them. He has only one remedy, and that is, one of his Judges ſometimes, touched with compaſſion for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon accuſed, or perhaps convinced of his Innocence, will take his Cauſe into his protection, and defend it againſt the Accuſers, but though theſe kind of good Offices happen now and then, they are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom effectual. For this <hi>Council</hi> is ſo inclinable to ſeverity, the leaſt offence in matter of <hi>State</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, and very appearance paſſes for a crime.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſaid that in <hi>Athens, Draco</hi> writ all his Laws in Blood; the ſame may be ſaid as juſtly of this <hi>Council,</hi> in which Clemency and Mercy are Virtues unknown; where jealouſy is incurable, diſtruſt eternal; where great reputation is dangerous; great ſervices odious, and commonly requited with either baniſhment, or death. The <hi>Maxims</hi> of this <hi>Council</hi> are theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That not only Crimes against the</hi> State <hi>are never to be pardoned, but even appearances are to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that they muſt proceed to puniſhment before they examine the offence. That in thoſe things ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow is to be taken for ſubſtance, and poſſibility for matter of fact; that humane Prudence is not to be contented that things are not yet hapned, but muſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der things ſo as they never may happen; that the Publick is to prevent what it fears, at their Coſt who gave the apprehenſion, without expecting till the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief occur, there being no greater crime than to be ſuſpicious to ones Prince, and to diſturb his Tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. That if in other Affairs it be diſcretion to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the ill-conſequences leſs than they will be, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of</hi> State, <hi>and things relating to its quiet and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, 'tis not only prudent but neceſſary to imagine them greater: that injuſtice to private Perſons is not to be conſidered where advantage accrews to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;</hi>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:50981:90"/>
                     <hi>becauſe,</hi> ſay they, <hi>'tis impoſſible to Govern without injury to ſomebody.</hi> To which we may add another of their <hi>Maxims</hi> no leſs pernicious, and that is; <hi>That 'tis wiſdom to rid themſelves of any body they have diſobliged by their wrongful ſuſpicions, leſt his reſentment puts him upon revenge, and the fear of a ſecond injury tempts him to ſecure himſelf, though by the ſubverſion of the Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By theſe <hi>Principles</hi> this <hi>Council</hi> is become ſo odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the <hi>Nobles,</hi> that they have tried all ways imaginable to ſupplant them. In the year 1628 the Family of the <hi>Cornari</hi> and their Party puſh'd it ſo far in revenge of the Quarrel of <hi>George Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro</hi> the then <hi>Duke</hi>'s Son, who had been proſcribed and degraded by the <hi>Ten,</hi> that their Court would have been certainly ſuppreſſed, had it not been prevented by an old <hi>Seignior;</hi> who in the <hi>Grand Council</hi> remonſtrated, <hi>That the ſafety of the</hi> State <hi>depended upon the continuation of that Council, which kept the Nobility in their duty, by fear of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and the People in obedience by the goodneſs of their Example. That to ſuppreſs that Tribunal, which was the ſvpport of their Laws; the knot of their Concord; the foundation of their Equality; their defence againſt Tyranny; and the true balance that kept all Parties in a poiſe, would be no leſs than to introduce Confuſion, Licentiouſneſs, and Impunity. That nothing rendred their</hi> Government <hi>more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and Conſpicuous, than to ſee their Nobility obnoxious to the ſevereſt of their Courts, and their Authority check'd by their fear, whilſt thoſe in greater Power were in greateſt Awe, ſeeing them expoſed to the rigour of the Laws as well, if not more, than particular Perſons. That thoſe who endeavoured to aboliſh them, were People who deſigned to be Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, if they were not ſo already. That they were to be ſeparated frrm the body of the</hi> State, <hi>if they</hi>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:50981:91"/>
                     <hi>could not ſubmit to a civil life, or ſubject themſelves to the Laws, which put them upon a happy neceſſity of doing well; and, in ſhort, That it would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable to ſuffer the clamours of a few Citizens to prevail for a Change ſo much to the prejudice of the</hi> State.</p>
                  <p>But however the ſaid <hi>Council</hi> is continued to this day, 'tis very diſpleaſing to the <hi>Nobility;</hi> who cannot hear it mentioned without tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1670 the <hi>Grand Council</hi> proceeding to the Election of the <hi>Ten,</hi> (who are renewed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year in the Month of <hi>Auguſt)</hi> all thoſe that were propoſed, were rejected two Sundays to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and in the third there was only <hi>Seignior Angelo Emo</hi> who paſſed in the Balotation: nay the ill-humour was carried on ſo far, that ſome of the Electors named either in contempt or deſpight, ſome of the new Nobility, and among the reſt a <hi>Portugal</hi> called <hi>Fonſeca,</hi> of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Extraction, knowing well thoſe kind of People would never get their juſt number of Voices. For that <hi>Court,</hi> which is as it were the Parliament and <hi>la Fournelle</hi> of the <hi>Nobles,</hi> has been always ſupplied by the worthieſt and beſt qualified Gentlemen.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs this <hi>Council</hi> is it, upon which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the whole Oeconomy of that <hi>Government:</hi> this <hi>Council</hi> is the Corner-ſtone of the <hi>State,</hi> not to be ſtirred without deſtruction to the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick. It is the Copy of the famous Temple the <hi>Ephori</hi> of <hi>Sparta</hi> erected to <hi>Fear,</hi> as the only Deity, was able to reſtrain men, and keep them to their duty: In a word, 'tis a Virgin full of eyes, and all of them inceſſantly watching for preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the common Liberty, inſomuch that it is obvious when-ever the <hi>Council of Ten</hi> is diſſolved, confuſion and diſorder will quickly follow in the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50981:91"/>
                     <hi>State,</hi> as hapned to the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>Sparta</hi> upon ſuppreſſion of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> who, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tell us, were the very Nerves of that flouriſhing <hi>Ariſtocracy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Quarantie Criminel</hi> labours upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for ſuppreſſion of the <hi>Council of Ten,</hi> as thoſe who have robbed them of their principal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; for before the Creation of theſe <hi>Decemviri,</hi> 'tis manifeſt the cogniſance of all Crimes belonged to that <hi>Chamber,</hi> and after that diſſolution it would return into the former Channel. For this reaſon <hi>Francis Contarini</hi> one of the Heads in the year 1628 ſpake with ſuch heat againſt them, that moſt of the Nobility cried out, <hi>Via via li Dieci, away with the Dieci,</hi> and others ſpared not to ſalute them with <hi>Vaga in mal' hora quel Conſiglio de Dieci, li ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga la rabbia. May the Council of Ten never proſper: the Devil them,</hi> and many other imprecations, that ſhew well enough what kindneſs the Nobility had for that Court. In effect, the Rigour of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Ten</hi> has been ſo great, there is ſcarce a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Family but produces inſtances of it, and many of them written in Blood.

way they take to prevent the Murmurs of the Nobles, who alwayes judg amiſs of the Decrees of the ſaid Court, from a conſtant averſion they bear to their Juriſdiction. This is the way they take to ſweeten and cajole the Parents and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the Defunct, as if they did it to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the infamy that would adhere to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, if the Execution ſhould be publick: And yet for all their tenderneſs, this Caution is never uſed but where the buſineſs is doubtful, for if the Evidence be clear, and the Perſon accuſed, palpably Guilty, no ſuch Complement is uſed; but he runs through all the formes of Juſtice, and is attended to the Gibbet with all manner of Solemnity. There is no Appeal from the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Council of Ten,</hi> no more than of old from the <hi>Roman Decemviri;</hi> nor can their Arreſt be modified, or altered, but by themſelves, or their Succeſſors: Only ſometimes the <hi>Avogadors</hi> might ſuſpend the Execution, provided it was not in matter of State, for in that Caſe no ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was endured.</p>

                  <p>No man's Conduct is ſo exact and regular, but theſe ſevere and ſcrutinous Judges will pick a hole in it, though it be but for faults of omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: And thoſe Perſons who eſcape out of their clutches, and come off with a bare reprimand, paſs in the world for men of exemplary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity, and incomparable Wiſdom.

                     <hi>Of the</hi> Quaranties.</head>
                  <p>THere are <hi>Three</hi> Courts in <hi>Venice</hi> called <hi>Quaranties,</hi> becauſe each of them conſiſts of <hi>Forty</hi> Members. The firſt is the New <hi>Quarentie-</hi>Civil, to which an Appeal lies in all
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50981:98"/>
Civil Cauſes, from the Sentence of all Magiſtrates abroad. The <hi>Second</hi> is the old <hi>Quarantie-Civil,</hi> that Judges in all Appeals from the inferiour Magiſtrates in the City. The <hi>Third</hi> is the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantie-Criminel,</hi> which Judges in all Criminal matters except Treaſon, which belongs properly to the <hi>Council of Ten.</hi> Theſe <hi>Three</hi> Courts are each of them conſiderable, but the laſt is of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reputation than the other two, becauſe all its Members have deliberative Voices in the <hi>Senat.</hi> Becauſe their <hi>Capi</hi> have place in the <hi>Colledg</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Councellors di Sopra,</hi> and becauſe it is called the <hi>Sereniſſimo Seignoria,</hi> like the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the <hi>Colledg,</hi> their three <hi>Councellors</hi> preſiding there in the name of the <hi>Seigniory.</hi> Beſides, this Court is the Parliament of all the Subjects of that <hi>State;</hi> as the <hi>Council of Ten</hi> is of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
                  <p>Eight Months is the time they remain in either of theſe <hi>Quaranties,</hi> and the firſt ſtep being to the <hi>New Quarantie,</hi> the next is to the <hi>Old,</hi> and the third to the <hi>Criminel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The two <hi>Quaranties-Civil</hi> conſiſt only of the poorer Nobility, for the richer ſort will not have patience to attend ſixteen Months to gain a <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat</hi> by their Place, and therefore they aſpire to enter at firſt into the <hi>Quarantie-Criminel,</hi> at leaſt into the <hi>Old Quarantie,</hi> one, or perhaps two Months before it concludes, to the end they may paſs preſently to the <hi>Quarantie-Criminel,</hi> and have Voices in the <hi>Pregadi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To each of theſe Courts there being two <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictors</hi> or <hi>Advocates,</hi> who undertake the Cauſes of the Defendants, and manage them againſt the <hi>Avogadors,</hi> eſpecially in Criminal matters, where all their Art and Rhetorick is ſhewn in the behalf of the Perſon accuſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:50981:98"/>
And here it is to be obſerved, that inferior Judges cannot be called to the <hi>Old Quarantie-Civil,</hi> without the advice and conſent of three <hi>Auditori Vecchi,</hi> nor to the <hi>New Quarantie-Civil</hi> but by permiſſion of the <hi>Auditori Novi:</hi> For if theſe <hi>Auditors</hi> confirm the Sentence of the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Magiſtrate, the buſineſs cannot be carried up into a higher Court, without depoſing a certain Sum of Money, beſides paying the Fees.</p>
                  <p>There have been admitted into the <hi>Senat</hi> forty of the Judges<hi>-Criminel,</hi> (who are commonly Gentlemen of the ſecond and third Form) to balance the ancient Nobility, againſt whom they uſually unite, by reaſon of the animoſity they bear them. But many times that is an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their affairs.</p>
                  <p>The Chiefs of theſe <hi>Quaranties</hi> change every two Months: It belongs to them to appoint the time for hearing a Cauſe, which they call <hi>dar il pendere,</hi> or <hi>dar il Conſiglio alle Cauſe.</hi> But in the two <hi>Quaranties-Civil,</hi> Priviledg'd Cauſes are firſt to be diſpatched, and thoſe next who are brought in by the <hi>Auditors</hi> in order, according to the Roll. Thoſe Cauſes are called Priviledg'd which are betwixt Father and Son, Mother and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Brother and Brother; as alſo the Cauſes of the <hi>Avogadori,</hi> which are called <hi>Cauſe Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadoreſche:</hi> The Cauſes of Priſoners, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils under the Tutilage of the <hi>Procurators</hi> of St. <hi>Mark.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis not lawful to ſolicit theſe Judges either in Perſon, or by Proxy: All that can lawfully be done in the <hi>Quaranties-Civil,</hi> is to Petition thoſe Chiefs to bring the buſineſs to a ſpeedy Hearing. But in the <hi>Quarantie-Criminel</hi> it is lawful to employ all the intereſt, and importunity of ones Friends. Let us now paſs to the inferior Magiſtrates of the City.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Avogadors</hi> were inſtituted under <hi>Duke Orie Malipierre</hi> about the year 1180, and are in <hi>France</hi> called <hi>Avocats</hi> General, but with this difference; in <hi>France</hi> they ſpeak finally after the Counſel for the Plaintiff has ſpoken; and at <hi>Venice</hi> the <hi>Avogadors</hi> ſpeak firſt, and open the Accuſation <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>The principal duty of an <hi>Avogador</hi> is to ſee the Laws obſerved, and to proceed rigorouſly againſt thoſe who tranſgreſs them; as alſo to oppoſe the Deliberations of all the other Magiſtrates.

                  <p>The difference betwixt the <hi>Tribunes</hi> and the <hi>Avogadors</hi> is this, that the <hi>Tribunes</hi> were Creatures

only of the People; the <hi>Avogadors</hi> of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi> in general, and are therefore called <hi>Avogadori di Commune</hi>

They remove all Proceſs whether they pleaſe, thoſe which are of no great conſequence, to the <hi>Quarantie Criminel;</hi> others to the <hi>Senat</hi> or <hi>Grand Council,</hi> according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Quarantie Criminel</hi> cannot refuſe them when they deſire to be heard, by reaſon of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Priviledg; and therefore when an <hi>Avoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> preſſes, all other buſineſs muſt be laid aſide. Sometimes they carry their Civil Affairs before the <hi>Colledg,</hi> as when Controverſy is about <hi>Fiefs,</hi> or Lands depending upon any Manor, which they would reunite to the Demeaſns, as it hapned in the year 1670 about Lands which the <hi>Avogadors</hi> of <hi>Breſcia</hi> alledged belonged in Propriety to them.</p>
                  <p>In all Debates and Deliberations either of the <hi>Grand Council</hi> or <hi>Senat,</hi> it is neceſſary at leaſt one <hi>Avogador</hi> be preſent; if not, their Reſolutions are void, and of none effect.</p>
                  <p>The good or ill Adminiſtration of Juſtice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon theſe <hi>Avogadors,</hi> it being their work to frame and prepare all Proceſſes brought into Court, and if they be ill men, as happens too oft, 'tis in their power to do a great deal of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
                  <p>There are always grave and auſtere men choſen into theſe Offices, to give the People greater awe and veneration for the Laws, and to oblige them to greater ſeverity, the Law gives theſe <hi>Avoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> a conſiderable ſhare in all Confiſcations. One <hi>Theodore Balbi,</hi> who had narrowly eſcaped the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of his enemies in the <hi>Council of Ten,</hi> was made an <hi>Avogador</hi> not long after his diſcharge, meerly out of an opinion that he would uſe the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50981:100"/>
ſame ſeverity towards other People, that he had experimented himſelf; and he anſwered their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Quarantie-Criminel</hi> judges a Perſon, the <hi>Avogador</hi> who brings in the Proceſs has no deliberative Voice, in reſpect that he is the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer; but he has power to propoſe the ridgeſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment he pleaſes, after which, the three Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the Aſſembly propoſe another more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, and both opinions being put to the <hi>Balot,</hi> plurality of Voices carry it.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Grand Council</hi> makes any new Order that the <hi>Avogadors</hi> judg prejudicial to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, or any ways incompatible with the Laws of the <hi>State;</hi> they can hinder the Regiſtring and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of it till it be more deliberately debated in another Aſſembly, like the <hi>Roman Tribunes,</hi> who could ſtop the Decrees of all other Magiſtrates; and this is called in <hi>Venice, Intromittero,</hi> anſwering to <hi>Intercederi</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> which is as much as to Withſtand, or to Oppoſe, in <hi>Engliſh</hi>

But the <hi>Seigniory</hi> diſcerning the drift of his Propoſition, and of what conſequence it would be to ſuffer Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Laws, they returned no Anſwer to the Embaſſadors motion, that they might not diſguſt him by a refuſal.</p>

                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:50981:100"/>
They have Power likewiſe to hinder their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of thoſe places, or the Execution of them, if in, till they purge themſelves of the Accuſations againſt them. Thus the <hi>Avogador Corrare</hi> would have ſuſpended the Veſt of the <hi>Procuratorſhip</hi> from <hi>Francis Moroſini,</hi> who had been in poſſeſſion of the ſaid Dignity 14 months, which doubtleſs would have had its effect, had not <hi>Corrare</hi> abandoned his Accuſation.</p>
                  <p>'Tis the Office of the <hi>Avogadors</hi> to exact and receive all Fines and Mulcts charged upon any Magiſtrate for tranſgreſſing the Laws: and out of every Fine they have a certain allowance, which with their other Fees, and ordinary Aſſignments upon confiſcated Goods, amounts, and makes their Revenue very conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>Being Guardians of the <hi>Laws,</hi> they are obliged at certain times to read in the <hi>Grand Council</hi> the ancient Laws, to rub up the memory of the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and keep them to a ſtricter obſervation of them. For good Laws are not ſufficient, without good Men to aſſert them, and ſee them put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution <note n="*" place="margin">Non ſatis viſum eſt bonas leges habere, niſi Cuſtodes earum diligentiſſimos Cives Creaſſent quos Graeci <gap reason="foreign">

no falſe Nobility might be foiſted in among the true; which would be eaſily diſcerned by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring their Notes with thoſe who preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for Entrance into the <hi>Council,</hi> when their age requires.</p>
                  <p>Their Authority formerly was much greater, for they had the management of all ſorts of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: but ſince the Power of the <hi>Council of Ten</hi> has been eſtabliſhed, the Power of the <hi>Avogadors</hi> has been leſſened: and yet they can ſuſpend the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the <hi>Grand Council,</hi> by producing new matter in favour of the Criminal, unleſs his Crime be againſt the <hi>Government,</hi> for in that Caſe there is no ſuſpenſion. It is always one of theſe <hi>Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadors</hi> who pronounces Sentence in that Court againſt the Perſons condemned. They are Elected by the <hi>Senat,</hi> and <hi>Grand Council;</hi> the firſt propoſes, and the ſecond almoſt conſtantly accepts, but they may reject if they pleaſe: yet that falls out but ſeldom, by reaſon of the reſpect is born to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat,</hi> whoſe Judgment is reckoned as their Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone for Vertue and Eſteem.</p>

He is privy to all Intrigues and Secrets of the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> which writes, nor receives no Letters of which he has not a ſight. He has the keeping of the <hi>Seal,</hi> and it cannot be taken from him without depoſing him quite. He is as it were a <hi>Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> born, by virtue of his Place, which gives him the title of Excellence, and precedence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the <hi>Senators</hi> and Magiſtrates of the City, except the <hi>Councellors</hi> of the <hi>Seigniory,</hi> and the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:50981:110"/>
                     <hi>Procurators</hi> of St. <hi>Mark.</hi> He is chief of all the Secretaries, who with him repreſent the Body of the <hi>Citizens,</hi> as the <hi>Doge</hi> and <hi>Councellors</hi> of the <hi>Colledg</hi> do the Body of the <hi>Nobles;</hi> and therefore in Latine Inſtruments he is called <hi>Magnus-Scriba, &amp; Scribarum Princeps.</hi> And it is to be obſerved the Office of <hi>Grand Chancellor</hi> is affected by all the Secretaries, as the end of their hopes and deſires, to which when they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, they will have no cauſe to lament any pains they have taken, or any Service they have done to the <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> there being no Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (with proportion) ſo well recompenced as they, no not the <hi>Doge</hi> himſelf, nor the <hi>Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors par merite.</hi> The <hi>Chancellors</hi> Office is for life; he wears <hi>Purple</hi> like the <hi>Duke,</hi> and the <hi>ſix Councellors</hi> of the <hi>Colledg;</hi> enjoys all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of a Nobleman, and has ſome peculiar to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>State</hi> allows him a Penſion of 3000 <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats,</hi> beſides the common Perquiſits of his place, which amount to 9 or 10000 <hi>Ducats</hi> more, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obliging him to any expence. In ſhort, he wants nothing but a deliberative Voice in the <hi>Councils,</hi> where he ſits only as an Inſtrument, and in that he is inferior to the meaneſt of the Nobility.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Seigniory</hi> marches upon any publick occaſion, the <hi>Chancellor</hi> is preceded by the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries;</hi> the <hi>Doge</hi> by the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> and the <hi>Senat</hi> by the <hi>Doge;</hi> where we may take notice of <hi>two</hi> different Cuſtoms, <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Nobles,</hi> which is preceded by their Chief; the <hi>otber</hi> of the <hi>Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadinance,</hi> or Body of <hi>Citizens,</hi> which proceds their Chief: the firſt to ſhew that the <hi>Nobility</hi> and the <hi>Citizens</hi> are not to take equal meaſures, the other to intimate that the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> is not
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50981:110"/>
the Creature of the People, but the Agent and Officer of the <hi>Nobles,</hi> by whom he is choſen, and of whom by conſequence he holds his Charge and Authority: and laſt of all to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the concord and harmony of all parts in the <hi>Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chancellor</hi> after his election, makes a publick entry, and paſſes to the <hi>Colledg</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by ſeveral <hi>Procurators,</hi> the ancienteſt of whom (aſſiſting commonly that day) gives him the upper hand, as the <hi>Senators</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Nobles</hi> do to the <hi>Citizens,</hi> who in that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony march like <hi>Noblemen</hi> in their <hi>Red</hi> Gowns: ſo that it is not altogether unlike the <hi>Saturnals</hi> of old, where the Servants were attended by their Maſters. In Publick Ceremonies, if it be <hi>Winter</hi> the <hi>Chancellor</hi> appears in a Crimſon<hi>-Velvet</hi> Robe; if <hi>Summer,</hi> in Red <hi>Damask,</hi> with his <hi>Stole</hi> of Gold: but his common habit is Scarlet or Purple Cloth.</p>
                  <p>In a word, when the <hi>Chancellor</hi> dyes, he has the ſame Honours as the <hi>Doge</hi> when he dies: his Funerals are kept in the Church of St <hi>Mark;</hi> and his Elogy pronounced in preſence of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat,</hi> who upon that occaſion are in Mourning, thereby ſhewing greater regrate for the loſs of their <hi>Chancellor,</hi> than for the loſs of their <hi>Duke,</hi> whoſe Obſequies are Celebrated by them in Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Robes, as I obſerved before.</p>
                  <p>Having ſo many Priviledges, 'tis no wonder that the <hi>Chancellor Auguſtin Vianole</hi> bought No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility for his Sons, without mentioning himſelf; the reaſon is plain, not being like to be <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi> and Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> together, (a thing that never happened but once, in favour to <hi>Mark Ottobon</hi> Father to the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of that name) he choſe rather to keep his place, and continue in
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50981:111"/>
the <hi>Populatc,</hi> than to quit it, and make himſelf <hi>Noble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chancellor Ballarin</hi> was of the ſame mind, and preferred his <hi>Chancellorſhip</hi> before the Honour of being <hi>Noble par Merite,</hi> that is to ſay <hi>gratis,</hi> which the <hi>Seigniory</hi> put to his choice.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chancellor</hi> is choſen by the <hi>Grand Council,</hi> as all the Magiſtrates of the City are.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Secretaries</hi> there are three ſorts. The firſt are called <hi>Secretaries</hi> of the <hi>Council of Ten,</hi> and are moſt conſiderable becauſe of the Preheminence of that Court. The ſecond are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Secretaries</hi> of the <hi>Senat:</hi> and the third <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,</hi> or <hi>Ducal Clerks:</hi> from <hi>Ducal Clerks</hi> they riſe to be <hi>Secretaries</hi> of the <hi>Senat,</hi> and from thence they are preferred to the <hi>Firſt,</hi> according to their reſpective Capacities. The <hi>Secretaries</hi> of the <hi>Council of Ten</hi> are but four, and their places are much ſought after, and very hard to be got. The <hi>Secretaries</hi> of the <hi>Senat</hi> are twenty four, of which five or ſix are imployed as Reſidents in <hi>Naples, Milan, Florence,</hi> and <hi>Zurich</hi> in <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with Penſions of 2000 <hi>Ducats:</hi> five or ſix others are imployed as <hi>Secretaries</hi> to their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſies in the Courts of Kings, where the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat</hi> continues them for ſeveral years, that at their leiſure they may imbibe all that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the inſtruction of thoſe who ſucceed them; and therefore they are ſeldom recalled, till they have ſerved under two or three Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors. And theſe are the <hi>Secretaries</hi> who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the <hi>Colledg</hi> at the Audience of Forreign Embaſſadors, that they may briefly expoſe to the <hi>Seigniory</hi> what are the Propoſals of the ſaid Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, which ſometimes are underſtood by none of the ſaid Lords, nor by the <hi>Secretary</hi> himſelf. But this inconvenience is prevented by a
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:50981:111"/>
Copy the Embaſſador gives in of his buſineſs, which is tranſlated and preſented before he be admitted by the <hi>Senat,</hi> to whom it belongs to give an Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Secretaries</hi> of theſe two formes are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to all affairs, it being their Office to read in the <hi>Colledg,</hi> and in the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> all the <hi>Letters</hi> writ to that <hi>State;</hi> and to prepare all thoſe which are ſent from the <hi>Senat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they carry an Anſwer to the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, they read it before them, and afterwards they impart it to their <hi>Secretaries:</hi> but if they be from home, the <hi>Secretaries</hi> carry back their Copy, for 'tis death to leave it behind them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Secretaries</hi> have each of them a Salary of 400 <hi>Ducats per annum,</hi> beſides other Profits and conſiderable Priviledges.</p>
                  <p>In Ceremonies they are clad in <hi>Violet-</hi>coloured Cloth, with <hi>Velvet</hi> Bonnets of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Secretaries</hi> of the third <hi>Claſſis,</hi> are not any preciſe number, and their Office is like our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters:</hi> For they enter all Judgments given in the Courts of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and the <hi>Rialte,</hi> to deliver them to the Parties. They draw up the Contracts of Marriage, and paſs all Wills, and other Acts relating to the <hi>Tabellionage.</hi> So that properly they are no more than <hi>Notaries</hi> or <hi>Regiſters,</hi> without any Cognizance in matters of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe three Orders of <hi>Secretaries</hi> depend wholly upon the <hi>Council of Ten,</hi> by whom they are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and when any of them is defective, he is reſponſible to that terrible Court.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Ducal</hi> Church of St. <hi>Mark</hi> acknowledges him not, becauſe it has a private Officer of its own called <hi>Primicirio</hi> who performs all the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Functions, giving Benediction to the People, with Indulgences for forty days: conferring the <hi>Quatre-Mineurs</hi> to all who preſent themſelves. And if at any time the <hi>Patriarch</hi> officiates in his <hi>Pontificalibus</hi> in preſence of the <hi>Seignioria,</hi> 'tis upon requeſt to the <hi>Primicier</hi> who conſents per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to do him that Honour, but without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it a Preſident.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Patriarch</hi> has the nomination only of two Benefices in the City, the <hi>Theologate</hi> of his own Church, and the Cure of St. <hi>Bartholomews,</hi> whoſe Curate is his Vicar by courſe: for the Pope hath the Collation of the <hi>Archdeaconry;</hi> the <hi>Chapter</hi> diſpoſes of the <hi>Prebendaries,</hi> and the <hi>Pariſhians</hi> Citizens as well as Nobles have the choice of their <hi>Curates.</hi>

Which occaſioned that common ſaying of <hi>Matthew Zanes, That</hi> Venice <hi>was become a ſecond</hi> Babylon.</p>
                  <p>A great <hi>Prelat</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> told me one day in Diſcourſe, <hi>That 'twas impoſſible for the</hi> Venetian <hi>Biſhops to reform the manners of their Clergy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſecular Magiſtrate held their hands, and made their Cenſures contemptible; and to annihilate their whole Eccleſiaſtical Power, hindred the holding of Synods, which are the beſt and moſt effectual means of correcting the enormities of the Prieſts.</hi> At the end of which I remember he added an Elogy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church of <hi>France,</hi> whither, as he ſaid, the ſanctity of the whole Primitive Church was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, concluding with theſe words, <hi>Piaceſſe a Dio che tutta la Chieſa ſi Governaſſe a Guiſa del Clero</hi> Franceſe. <hi>And would to God our Church was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned according to the</hi> French <hi>model.</hi>

                  <p>There is another thing alſo, a great diminution to his Authority, and that is, That the Body of the Secular Clergy in <hi>Venice,</hi> which contains 70 Pariſhes, is divided into nine Congregations, each of which has a ſeparate Juriſdiction, where all Cauſes of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Friers</hi> in their ſeveral Wards, are firſt judged; and if there be occaſion

                  <p>THis <hi>General</hi> is always a Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> and Created by the <hi>Senat,</hi> in time of War to Command the Fleet of the <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> His Power is ſo abſolute over all other <hi>Generals,</hi> and <hi>Captains,</hi> that he ſeems a <hi>Dictator,</hi> and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Sovereign than a Subject, for the three years of his Command.

                  <p>Moreover there is no Prince whatever who at their return uſes their <hi>Generals</hi> worſe than the <hi>Venetians.</hi> If any of them have loſt a <hi>Battle</hi> or a <hi>Town,</hi> they are plagued by the Inquiſitors of <hi>State,</hi> or rather by as many Judges as there are Nobles in the City: the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> having given them the Conduct of their Armies, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Towns, upon the ſame condition the famous Lady of <hi>Sparta</hi> gave the Buckler to her Son, <hi>Aut in hoc, aut cum hoc:</hi> intending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that he ſhould either dye, or return with what ſhe had given him.

                  </p>
                  <p>In the year 1670, the difference betwixt them and the <hi>Port</hi> about Confines in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> having cauſed the <hi>Venetians</hi> to apprehend a new Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the whole World immediately caſt their eyes upon <hi>Francis Moroſini,</hi> though he was in diſgrace, and at that time actually under a Charge: and not without cauſe, for there was none but he capable of the Command which he had in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> and had the War gone on, the <hi>Senat</hi> would have been conſtrained to have begged him to have taken upon him the <hi>Generalſhip</hi> again.</p>
                  <p>The awe the <hi>Captains</hi> have of the <hi>Council of Ten,</hi> does not deter them from applying their utmoſt induſtry to raiſe their own fortunes though to the prejudice of the Publick, not doubting but to find an <hi>Aſylum,</hi> if they have where withall to purchaſe it <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50981:120"/>
they uſe all imaginable Artifice to conceal the defects of their Adminiſtration, being deſirous to appear as innocent as <hi>Gracchus</hi> who aſſured the People of <hi>Rome</hi> that he went rich to <hi>Sardena,</hi> but returned poor <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>A <hi>General</hi> of <hi>Candia</hi> would have perſwaded the <hi>Venetians</hi> to the ſame thing by borrowing 4000 <hi>Ducats</hi> of a Merchant to defray the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his entry into his <hi>Procuratorſhip,</hi> though he had brought back ſeveral Barrels of Silver which ſtood him in good ſtead.

                  <p>They are obliged by a certain Law to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves up into Cuſtody before they give an account of their adminiſtration, eſpecially if they have been overcome, which is a great cauſe of Perſecution at <hi>Venice,</hi> where nothing but ſucceſs is conſidered.

                  <p>SUch is the coherence and connexion betwixt the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> that one is not well comprehended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other: wherefore to render my work more compleat, I have made an abridgement of the Treatiſe of <hi>Fra. Paolo</hi> about the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> in which we may ſee the Meaſures the <hi>Senat</hi> took with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks. But becauſe my deſign is to give you an extract, not a tranſlation of thoſe paſſages, it cannot be thought ſtrange that I have not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the order of the Original, nor pinned my ſelf up to the words of the Author, his ſentiments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient. And to give more light to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in two or three places I have added ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> and of the Excommunication of the <hi>Venetians;</hi> a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod which I ſuppoſe will not be diſpleaſing to the Reader.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> was firſt introduced in <hi>Venice,</hi> it was not by Command of the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50981:126"/>
by any <hi>Papal Bull;</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Bulls</hi> of <hi>Innocent</hi> IV, <hi>Alexander</hi> IV, <hi>Element</hi> IV, and of ſeven other <hi>Popes,</hi> could not oblige the <hi>Venetians</hi> to receive it, as the reſt of the Principal Towns in <hi>Italy</hi> did: But it was brought in by Decree of the <hi>Grand Council,</hi> to which <hi>Nicholas</hi> IV conſented; framing to that end his <hi>Bull</hi> of the 28 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1289, in which he inſerted the Decree of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> with all its Clauſes; one of which ran thus, <hi>That the</hi> Senat <hi>ſhould aſſign a Fond for the neceſſary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of that Sacred Office, and ſhould likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all the Money iſſuing from Amerciaments, or otherwiſe, to which end the ſaid</hi> Senat <hi>ſhould name an Officer to be accountable to them.</hi> Which is a thing quite different from the Cuſtom of other <hi>Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> where the Money goes to the <hi>Inquiſitors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Inquiſition</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> is mixed, partly of <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> partly of <hi>Seculars.</hi> The <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi> are Judges, the <hi>Seculars</hi> are <hi>Aſſiſtants,</hi> whereas formerly the <hi>Seculars</hi> were <hi>Judges</hi> in Caſes of <hi>Hereſy,</hi> upon information from the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks,</hi> whoſe Office was only to examine the Opinions of thoſe who were accuſed of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy;</hi> after which if the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> found them guilty, the <hi>Duke</hi> and the <hi>Council</hi> condemned them to be Burned. And this Secular <hi>Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> continued from the year 1249, (at which time it was eſtabliſhed upon occaſion of the Wars betwixt <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> IV, and <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour) till the year 1289, when the <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Inquiſition</hi> was admitted by the <hi>Senat.</hi> So that there having been in <hi>Venice Secular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors</hi> againſt <hi>Hereſy,</hi> before the erection of this Sacred Office, occaſion was given to take in <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> among the <hi>Seculars;</hi> it being unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that the new <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> admitted only by favour, ſhould exclude the antient, who in reality were their Maſters.</p>

There are therefore <hi>three Senators</hi> always aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the Prince's name to all Tranſactions and Decrees of that Court, in which nothing paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes whereof the Prince is not thorowly adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed. The <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> cannot bear Witneſs, nor Cite, nor Examine a Delinquent, but with the participation and aſſiſtance of theſe <hi>three Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:</hi> For which reaſon the Secretary begins all Acts with this form, <hi>Cum aſſiſtentia &amp; praeſentia Illuſtriſſ. &amp; Excellentiſſ. D. D. N.</hi> according to the agreement of <hi>Pope Julius</hi> III, with the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick of Venice.</hi> And if the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> preſume to do the leaſt thing without the knowledg of the <hi>Aſſiſtants,</hi> 'tis actually void: ſo that if in their abſence, proceſs be framed, it ſuffices not that the Articles, or particularities, were commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to them before Judgment, nor that they were preſent when Sentence was pronounced, for the <hi>Senat</hi> will not truſt to the integrity of the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks:</hi> but new Proceſs muſt be made from the beginning to the ending, otherwiſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceed to execution: by which means the <hi>Senat</hi> prevents diſputes with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which turnes every thing into Preſident though but once done.</p>
                  <p>And if the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> ſhould deſire of the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants</hi> permiſſion to make any Proceſs without them, it is expreſly forbidden them to grant it, becauſe condeſcenſion belongs to the Prince, not to the perſons who repreſent him. Beſides this permiſſion is not equivalent to the preſence of the Magiſtrate, who knows not afterwards whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> have done well or ill: a thing of no little importance to the ſervice of the Publick.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo <hi>Aſſiſtants</hi> in all places under the Dominion of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> where there are <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors;</hi>

it being convenient, if not neceſſary that all inferiour Cities ſhould be ſubject to the Laws and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Metropolis,</hi> with ſafety to their Immunities and particular Priviledges; and therefore the <hi>Rectors</hi> aſſiſt in the Sacred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and perform all the Functions of the <hi>Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants</hi> in <hi>Venice.</hi> But becauſe the other Duties of their imployments, may ſometimes hinder the <hi>Rectors</hi> from being preſent, the <hi>Vicar</hi> of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtat,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Vicario Praetorio.</note> or ſome other <hi>Curial Officer,</hi> is permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to go in their ſtead. And here it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the <hi>Curial Aſſiſtant</hi> is not to ſerve as a <hi>Councellor</hi> to the <hi>Inquiſitor,</hi> though he be ſo to the <hi>Podeſtat,</hi> the Office of a <hi>Councellor</hi> and an <hi>Aſſiſtant</hi> being incompatible; becauſe the <hi>Councellor</hi> is an Officer of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and by conſequence depends upon it, but the <hi>Aſſiſtants</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance is only upon the Prince whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents: ſo that if the <hi>Curial</hi> ſhould become a <hi>Councellor,</hi> the <hi>Aſſiſtance,</hi> which is a thing of Superiority, would degenerate into <hi>Counſel,</hi> and render the Perſon ſubject to the <hi>Inquiſitor;</hi> which would be a great prejudice to the <hi>Secular Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances</hi> that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would willingly aboliſh.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> was an infinite trouble to <hi>Pope Paul</hi> V, who had an inconceivable deſire to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the power of the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks.</hi> For the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> being the principal Nerve, and chief Prerogative of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> as was pretended by <hi>Paul</hi> IV; it was very unpleaſant to <hi>Paul</hi> V (who boaſted, <hi>That God had made him</hi> Pope <hi>to mortify the preſumption of the</hi> Seculars) to ſee the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> humble the Pride of the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> and hold the <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> in dependance upon the <hi>Aſſiſtants. Pope Julius</hi> III thought he had gained a great point, when in his agreement with the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:50981:127"/>
                     <hi>Republick</hi> he hedged in this Clauſe, <hi>Cum aſſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia &amp; praeſentia,</hi> imagining it would evidently appear that the <hi>three</hi> Deputies from the <hi>Senat</hi> were not Judges in matters relating to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,</hi> but only <hi>Aſſiſtants.</hi> Nevertheleſs the Court have ſince owned how much that <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> is prejudicial to their Authority: and that which before they interpreted a Victory upon the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> they have ſince found to be a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable loſs. Wherefore they have applied the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their endeavours to aboliſh that Cuſtom, as injurious to their Authority; but the <hi>Senat</hi> has ſo well defended it, that the <hi>Popes</hi> have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over all further thoughts of conteſting. The care the <hi>Aſſiſtants</hi> took to ſuffer no Act to paſs without the form <hi>Cum aſſiſtentia,</hi> &amp;c. which pleaſed the <hi>Romans</hi> ſo well, has proved an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who have ſince made uſe of that Clauſe, to ſhew the Cuſtom of their <hi>Aſſiſtance.</hi> The <hi>Popes</hi> would willingly deny it, notwithſtanding their Agreement in 1551, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that they were ignorant of the nature of an Agreement, which implying the conſent of both parties concerned, could not be revoked or cancelled by one: It being little leſs than a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to affirm, that a thing concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two Princes under reciprocal Obligations, ſhould notwithſtanding remain at the diſpoſition of one of them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Aſſiſtants</hi> take no Oath of Fidelity to the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> ſeeing they are neither Officers of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> nor called thither by the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks.</hi> On the contrary they are ſent thither by the <hi>Doge</hi> to obſerve the proceedings of the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> and inform the <hi>Senat</hi> of what paſſes, in perſuance of an Oath they take to conceal nothing from him, nor to do any thing without
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50981:128"/>
his Order. And by this it is the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> ſeems to be mixed, both of <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> and <hi>Seculars.</hi> For where it is purely <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> all the <hi>Seculars</hi> ſwear Secrecy and Fidelity to the <hi>Inquiſitors.</hi> But here the <hi>Aſſiſtants</hi> have power to ſuſpend the Decrees of the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> and to ſtop the Execution of their Sentences, not only when they are contrary to the Laws and Cuſtoms of their Countrey, but when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with their private Inſtructions from the <hi>Senat,</hi> or the particular Rules of their <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

                  <p>And if anciently the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> ſwore at their Election to puniſh <hi>Hereticks,</hi> it was to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> (as the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> do at this day) not to the <hi>Inquiſitors.</hi> But there is great difference betwixt ſwearing indefinitely, and ſwearing to another perſon: the <hi>firſt</hi> Oath being an Act that binds him only to himſelf and his own Conſcience, whereas the <hi>other</hi> ownes a Subjection and Obligation to him to whom he ſwears. And to prove that the <hi>Doges</hi> never took any ſuch Oath, we need no more than the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of <hi>Duke Peter Gradenique</hi> given in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>Frier Anthony</hi> an <hi>Inquiſitor,</hi> who would have had the ſaid <hi>Duke</hi> ſworn to have preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>Papal</hi> and <hi>Imperial</hi> Conſtitutions againſt <hi>Hereticks:</hi> To which the <hi>Duke</hi> replied, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Oath he had taken at his Election by the Contract betwixt the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Pope Nicholas</hi> IV, he the ſaid <hi>Duke</hi> was not to take another, or oblige himſelf to other Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical or Imperial Orders than what were ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the ſaid Contract. In the mean time the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> deſpairing to bring the <hi>Aſſiſtants</hi> to any ſuch Oath, they endeavoured to oblige them to Secrecy in ſome things relating to <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> pretend that at leaſt the <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi> have no right to Aſſiſt at the Proceſs of an <hi>Eccleſiaſtick;</hi> ſuppoſing erroneouſly that the <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Aſſiſtance was introduced only for what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the <hi>Laity.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> reply, that their <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> is not appropriate to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but to the Crime; and that therefore <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy</hi>

being a <hi>Secular,</hi> as well as an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence (it being on the one ſide an Invaſion of the Faith, and on the other an Invaſion of the Peace of the Publick) it follows that all <hi>Heretical</hi> Cauſes are to be Judged by the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> with interventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Seculars,</hi> which is contrary to the practice in other Countries, where if the Cauſe be <hi>Spiritual,</hi> the <hi>Secular</hi> perſon is Judged by the <hi>Eceleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick;</hi> if <hi>Temperal,</hi> the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> is judged by the <hi>Secular.</hi> Beſides, by a pretenſion of the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> the Cauſe of a <hi>Prieſt</hi> or <hi>Monk</hi> turned <hi>Heretick,</hi> (though his accomplices are <hi>Secular)</hi> ought to be judged only by <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Eccleſiaſtick,</hi> which is to open a door for the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> to drive out the <hi>Aſſiſtants,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the year 1610, the <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> of <hi>Breſcia</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon occaſion of a <hi>Capuchin</hi> of that City's being accuſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> made an Eſſay to take from the <hi>Aſſiſtants</hi> the Cognizance of ſuch Proceſſes as were begun at <hi>Rome:</hi> By which the <hi>Secular Aſſiſtance</hi> would have been aboliſhed; for the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> of the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> would have found means to have ingaged the Accuſers either by promiſes, or pretences of Religion, to ſend their Depoſitions in Writing to <hi>Rome:</hi> upon which that Court having examined the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would have returned their Proceſs to the places where the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> would have been Maſters. But the Wiſdom of the <hi>Senat</hi> defeated that artifice; and order was ſent to the <hi>Rectors</hi> of all their <hi>Towns</hi> to have a ſtrict eye upon the Conduct of the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> and to ſee they exactly obſerved all the Statutes and Formes of the <hi>Venetian Inquiſition,</hi> without receding one jot for any thing the <hi>Monks</hi> could alledge. For the ſame reaſon the <hi>Senat</hi> ordered their <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants</hi> to take care the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> did not inſert
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:50981:129"/>
in their Proceſſes any Forreign Statute, that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> (which makes advantage of every thing indulged to them) might not innovate in the <hi>Venetian Inquiſition,</hi> which ought to be regulated by her own, and not by the Cuſtoms of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon which it had no dependance being not of <hi>Papal</hi> Inſtitution. In effect, if the <hi>Congregation</hi> of <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> General at <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould take the Priviledg to derive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the particular <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> of <hi>Towns</hi> under the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Venetian,</hi> as they do to ſeveral places in <hi>Italy,</hi> it would be the ſame thing, as if the whole Proceſs was perfected at <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe the other <hi>Tribunals</hi> could act no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but according to their Inſtruction from thence. Moreover, if the <hi>Acts</hi> made by the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> without <hi>Aſſiſtants</hi> be Null in <hi>Venice, a fortiore,</hi> the <hi>Acts</hi> made out of their Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and by conſequence without any partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the <hi>Aſſiſtants,</hi> are vain and invalid. Not but if the <hi>Congregation</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> ſend any Directions or Rule that is convenient to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and does not claſh with the Temporal Juriſdiction, the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> ought to receive it with reſpect, and put it in execution; provided it be done according to the Stile and Cuſtom of their Countrey, the form of the new Decree running in the name of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> of the Place, and paſſing in preſence of the publick <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants,</hi> without mentioning that the Decree came from <hi>Rome,</hi> leſt the <hi>Venetian Inquiſition</hi> ſhould ſeem ſubject to the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon which it has no dependance: for it imports not much though the Direction comes from <hi>Rome,</hi> if in the publication no Authority be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged but the Authority of the <hi>Senat;</hi> for 'tis that Authority which animates the Decree,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50981:130"/>
becauſe if the <hi>Duke</hi> admits it not (as it happens many times in <hi>Venice)</hi> the Decree is void and and of none effect. Again when the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> execute any Command from <hi>Rome,</hi> they examine not whence it comes, but whether it be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Publick, and conformable to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of their Countrey, not enquiring whether it was done by their own motion, or inſtigation from other People, ſo no other name be mentioned in it, than the name of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Aſſiſtants</hi> are likewiſe to hinder the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors</hi> from publiſhing any <hi>Bull</hi> old or new, without permiſſion from the <hi>Duke;</hi> and this is founded upon the following Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe a compact cannot naturally be, but by conſent of the parties contracting, and therefore is not to be changed but by common accord. Thus the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> being eſtabliſhed in <hi>Venice</hi> by Agreement, no new Law ought to be admitted, but by conſent of both parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; and therefore the <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Decrees</hi> of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> made ſince this Agreement, have no obligation upon the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, If the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> makes Orders and Laws according to their own ſentiments and deſigns, it is not equitable that the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> receive his new Decretals with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examining firſt, whether or no they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their affairs. Every Prince knows the Intereſt of his own <hi>State,</hi> the <hi>Popes</hi> do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themſelves for the intereſt of <hi>Secular</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 'tis therefore the <hi>Princes</hi> duty to watch that nothing new, or dangerous to their affairs be foiſted upon them by the <hi>Papal</hi> Order; for that which the <hi>Popes</hi> propoſe of running to them in caſe of diſorder is a remedy worſe than the diſeaſe, ſeeing by that means they would make
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50981:130"/>
themſelves Arbiters in all Civil Controverſy what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Wherefore the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> has been always very ſhie and cautious in that caſe; no Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> having pried more narrowly, ſeen farther into the deſigns of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them with more vigor and ſucceſs: and her caution is continued to this day, the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of no <hi>Bull</hi> being permitted but after long and mature deliberation. And if it ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, his <hi>Holineſs</hi> ſends a Common <hi>Bull</hi> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Princes,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> are always the laſt who receive it; not that they may Regulate by the example of the reſt, but to have time to ſift and diſcover the ſubtilties of that Court, which are always introduced with pretences of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In fine, as the <hi>Popes</hi> apply themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dúſtriouſly to the augmentation of the <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical</hi> Power, and the ſubjection of the <hi>Secular;</hi> the <hi>Senat</hi> on their ſide are as ſolicitous againſt it, uſing all poſſible care at the reception of any <hi>Bull,</hi> that nothing may ſurprize them: and to this end they cannot be preſented to the <hi>Colledg,</hi> till they have been canvaſed and ſubſcribed by two <hi>Doctors,</hi> entertained on purpoſe by the <hi>State</hi> to give the <hi>Doge</hi> notice if they contain any thing of Myſtery or Innovation. And this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in the <hi>Senat</hi> at the reception of their <hi>Bulls,</hi> makes the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> as cautious how they offend them.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the <hi>Aſſiſtance;</hi> let us now exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how far the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> in the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> extends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> living in the Territory of this <hi>State,</hi> are not puniſhable by the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> for any Crime they commit; and this Rule is founded u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Doctrine <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Quid mihi de iis qui foris ſunt judicare?</hi> 1 Cor. 15.</note>, that <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:50981:131"/>
extends not to thoſe who are not, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were of the ſame Church: and by a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> III, it has been Declared, that the <hi>Jews</hi> not being ſubject to the ſame Law, ſhould not be Judged by the Law: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Poland</hi> they are judged by <hi>Palatins,</hi> and not by <hi>Eccleſiaſticks.</hi> Moreover, it is well known that <hi>Sixtus</hi> V, and <hi>Clement</hi> VIII, granted Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct to the <hi>Maranes,</hi> to remain, and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick in the Town of <hi>Ancona,</hi> without being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted or diſturbed by the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII, of the year 1581, which ſubjected <hi>Jews,</hi> and all other <hi>Infidels</hi> to that Sacred Office. Beſides the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> being erected only againſt Hereticks, <hi>Judaiſme</hi> being no Hereſy, falls not under their Juriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>If a <hi>Jew</hi> ſpeaks irreverently of our Religion, if he blaſphemes our Myſteries, prophanes our Sacred things, debauches any body to his Religion, the <hi>Eccleſiasticks,</hi> and other perſons concerned, bring their complaints to the Officer on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> who fails not to puniſh him ſeverely according to ancient Cuſtom in the Church, by which the <hi>Eccleſiasticks</hi> concerned themſelves no farther than to judg whether the Opinion complained of as Hereſy was contrary to our Faith; which having determined, they committed them to the <hi>Secular</hi> to be Judged. And this was the Practice of the Church under the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, till the Diviſion in the year 800; and in the Eaſtern Empire to the laſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Inquiſition</hi> Judges not the <hi>Greeks,</hi> for theſe following Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Becauſe 'tis unreaſonable the Miniſters of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould Judge the <hi>Greeks</hi> in their own proper Cauſe, the <hi>Greeks</hi> inſiſting upon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Canons which ſubmit every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50981:131"/>
to its own proper Prelats; and the <hi>Romans</hi> pretending to be above the Canons, do challenge a right of changing and vacating the ancient Conſtitutions and Laws of the <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> This Doctrine has cauſed the ſeparation of thoſe two Churches, which lived in unity and Chriſtian Charity the ſpace of 800 years before; the <hi>Greeks</hi> acknowledging the <hi>Pope</hi> to be St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Succeſſor, and firſt of all the Catholick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, whileſt he contented himſelf with the Power the Canons allowed him, and kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf within the bounds of his Primacy; without pretending to Sovereignty over the reſt of the Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Doge</hi> permitting the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition</hi> to meddle with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> would leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen his own Authority over them, and leave it to ſuch as could not exerciſe it without great trouble and confuſion. The Power of puniſhing Offences in matters of Religion, has been always inveſted in the Civil Magiſtrate quite through the <hi>Grecian</hi> Church, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> of this age do readily confeſs, as deſiring that Cuſtom might be continued: and thus Juſtice is adminiſtred to the <hi>Greeks</hi> by the Civil Power with general ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; whereas if the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> interpoſed in their affairs, the whole Nation would oppoſe themſelves againſt their Judgments, and mutiny againſt their Soveraignty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> receiving the <hi>Greeks</hi> under the <hi>Venetian</hi> Protection, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to live <hi>ſecondo il Rito loro:</hi> But their Cuſtoms and Statutes would ſubject them to Princes for puniſhment of all Temporal Crimes, and to Prelates of the Church for Spititual Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. From whence it follows, that it belongs not to the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> either to Judg or Examine
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50981:132"/>
what the <hi>Greeks</hi> do, or believe privately, but only to inform the Civil Magiſtrate of ſuch as are ſcandalous, either in their actions or words. Beſides, the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> does no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the Church, by permitting the <hi>Greeks</hi> to live according to the general Cuſtom of their Countrey, becauſe that permiſſion was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Condition of their Obedience to that <hi>State:</hi> and for the <hi>Senat</hi> to ſubject them to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,</hi> would be no leſs than of good and faithful Subjects, to make them Rebels, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Enemies; from whence no advantage could accrue to the <hi>Inquiſition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For theſe Reaſons the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> (that Governs its Subjects by peaceable Principles more than any other Prince in <hi>Europe)</hi> have been unwilling to conſent that the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſhould be liable to the Judgment of the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> let the nature of their Charge be what it would.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Inquiſition</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> hath no Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of ſuch as have two Wives, though they pretend to it, alledging that Crime to be an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of the Sacrament of Marriage. To which it is anſwered, that the firſt Marriage (which is good) rendering the ſecond void, there is no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of the Sacrament, and by conſequence it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> to rectify, but to the Civil Magiſtrate, who is obliged to puniſh the injury the Husband does to his Wife; becauſe 'tis an offence againſt Civil ſociety as much as Adultery, which every body knows is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the <hi>Inquiſition.</hi> Bigamy is Judged by the <hi>Lords Criminal of the Night,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Jews</hi> who live in Adultery with the Wives of Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Inquiſition</hi> meddles not with Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, becauſe it belongs to the <hi>Secular</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate according to the Civil and Canon Law,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50981:132"/>
and Cuſtom of all Chriſtendom. But if the Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer gives any ſuſpition of Hereſy againſt the Informer, the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> Judges of the ſuſpition, and with him the Magiſtrate for Blaſphemy, ſo by that means the accuſed perſon is never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, there being two ſentences againſt an Offender, one of the Sacred Office, for Spiritual chaſtiſement, the other of the Civil Magiſtrate, for Corporal correction.</p>
                  <p>As to what the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> ſay, that 'tis too great ſeverity for a man to have two Sentences, alledging an old Aphoriſme, <hi>That one Judg is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for one Offence;</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> reply, It is no inconvenience to have two Judges in the ſame Cauſe, when the puniſhments inflicted are of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds, and the ends of thoſe Judgments are different. So in the caſe of Blaſphemy (which ſavours of Hereſy) the natural end of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor</hi> is to convince the Blaſphemer of the truth, and to abſolve him from the Cenſures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred by his Blaſphemy; whereas the end of the Civil Magiſtrate is to puniſh the injury to the Divine Majeſty, whoſe Service and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour all Princes and Magiſtrates are obliged to regard, becauſe it is he who has put the Sword of Juſtice into their hands, to be the Miniſters <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Non enim ſine cauſa Gladium portat; Dei enim Miniſter eſt Vindex in iram ei qui malum agit.</hi> Ep. ad Rom. c. 13.</note> of his Indignation and Vengeance.</p>
                  <p>From whence it muſt be concluded that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, being charged with the care of Religion, which God has recommended to them ſo oft both in the Old and New Teſtament, are bound in Conſcience to imploy their Authority againſt Blaſphemers, for whoſe puniſhment the <hi>Inquiſition</hi>
                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:50981:133"/>
has no Pains ſuitable to the greatneſs of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, becauſe the pains they inflict are Spiritual, and not being ſo ſenſible, the Blaſphemers and Swearers do frequently relapſe into the ſame Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties; ſo that 'tis abſolutely neceſſary for the ſervice of God, and the good of the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> that the Secular Maſtiſtrate has Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in theſe Caſes, to retain people in their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by fear of Corporal puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>For the ſame Reaſons, Sorcerers, and ſuch kind of Delinquents are not judged at <hi>Venice</hi> by the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> which notwithſtanding has Cognizance of Hereſy, when indicated by abuſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>Senat</hi> ſuffers not the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> to take notice of Uſurers, Victuallers, Innekeepers, nor Butchers who ſell fleſh in Lent; The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate being qualified for the puniſhment of ſuch offenders when accuſed by the Eccleſiaſticks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in appearance the exorbitance of thoſe kind of people proceed only from Covetouſneſs: for to imagine a Butcher that ſells Fleſh in Lent does it, becauſe he thinks Abſtinence at that time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, is a fancy that may make all ſorts of whimſies Hereſy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It is not allowed the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> to make Information againſt either the People or Magiſtrates for any thing relating to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Juſtice. The reaſon is this, Becauſe Hereſy being a perſonal fault, the people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accuſed of Hereſy, though every one were Hereticks: and by conſequence the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> ought not to proceed but againſt particulars, the Commnoalty being under the Protection and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Prince. So the Magiſtrate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a private perſon, may render himſelf ſuſpected of Hereſy by his words or his actions;
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:50981:133"/>
but conſidered in his Office, he cannot either for the one or the other be ſubject to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> becauſe as ſuch, he is inveſted with Publick Authority, and can be reſponſible only to his Prince.</p>
                  <p>If the Magiſtrate gives impediment to the proceedings of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> either by hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the appearance of a perſon accuſed, or ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned in as a Witneſs, the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> is not to proceed but only by remonſtrating to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate or Prince, by means of the <hi>Aſſiſtants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And foraſmuch as the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> have often endeavoured to inſert new orders in the Edict of Juſtice, which by Cuſtom they publiſh at the entrance into their Office, ſome of them have reiterated the ſaid publication five or ſix times, to foiſt in ſuch Commands and Inhibitions as are ſuitable to ſuch occaſions as they think ought to be favourable to them. To prevent this inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the <hi>State</hi> has wiſely limited the form and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary tenor of the ſaid Proclamation to ſix Heads, to which nothing can be added by the <hi>Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Firſt is againſt ſuch as are Hereticks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or knowing others to be ſo, do not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them.</p>
                  <p>The Second againſt thoſe who hold meetings or diſcourſes to the prejudice of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>The Third, againſt thoſe who Celebrate Maſs, or Confeſs Sinners, without being Prieſts.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth, againſt Blaſphemers, whoſe Faith is ſuſpected.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth, againſt thoſe who obſtruct the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> who offend its Miniſters, and threaten to abuſe the Informers or Witneſſes <hi>per cauſa del Officio,</hi> that is to ſay, by reaſon of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:50981:134"/>
their Office, or out of animoſity to the perſons concerned. For if it be upon other occaſion, he who did the injury to the Officer of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> ought to be Judged by the ordinary Magiſtrate: otherwiſe it would be a great abuſe, by which the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> would quickly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a right of puniſhing all ſorts of Offences, and bring all Cauſes before them, and therefore the <hi>Senat</hi> has wiſely added this reſtriction, <hi>Per opere ſpectanti ad eſſo Officio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sixth againſt thoſe who have, Print, or cauſe to be-Printed Heretical Books tending to the ſubverſion of Religion. In theſe caſes the <hi>Aſſiſtants</hi> have power to ſtop the proceedings of the <hi>Inquiſitors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was a good Law made by the <hi>Council of Ten</hi> in the year 1568, by which the Confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Eſtate of a perſon condemned for Hereſy went to the right Heirs, upon condition no part of it was applied to the uſe of the Condemned perſon. So that the Eccleſiaſticks were wiped of the advantages they formerly made of thoſe they condemned, the <hi>Seigniory</hi> of <hi>Venice-</hi>holding it cruelty to deprive the Son (who perhaps is a good Chriſtian) of his Eſtate, for the Hereſy of his Father. Againſt this Law the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> continually mumurs, but with little ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs</p>
                  <p>As to the Books forbidden by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> to publiſh in their Dommions any other Catalogue of prohibited Books, than that which they received by agreement with <hi>Clement</hi> VIII, 1596. And as this Catalogue has been Printed ſeveral times ſince, and the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors</hi> have uſed all imaginable Artifice to foiſt in new prohibited Books, and by that means elude
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:50981:134"/>
the agreement, ſo the <hi>Senat</hi> has doubled their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance, and put themſelves in a condition not to be impoſed upon by the Eccleſiaſticks: and when the publication of any new prohibited Book that treats not of Faith, is in queſtion, before the <hi>Senat</hi> conſents, the Tenor and Doctrine of the Book is thoroughly by their Order examined, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſoberly conſidered that moved the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to condemn it; after which, if the Book be prohibited, the prohibition runs in the <hi>Doges</hi> name, and not in the name of the <hi>Inquiſitors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> have cauſed the Catalogue of 1595 to be Printed very oft, all out of oſtentation, and to let the World ſee that the licenſing of Books belongs wholly to the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks; the <hi>Senat</hi> has given Order that the ſaid Catalogue ſhould not be Printed for the future, but with the Articicles of Agreement at the end of it: by which the Eccleſiaſticks have loſt much of their heat and deſire of Printing the Catalogue again, becauſe they would have no Copies of the Articles, that contain in them many checks and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions of their Power in thoſe Affairs.</p>
                  <p>As to defamatory Libels writ againſt the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their Neighbours, though by Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks themſelves, the <hi>Venetian</hi> affirms that the Inquiſition ought not to take Cognizance of them, becauſe their Office was eſtabliſhed for the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Hereſy, not the caſtigation of Calumny; that Function belonging more properly to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrate, to whom God has recommended it.</p>
                  <p>If the Eccleſiaſticks be ſufferers in it, they muſt apply themſelves to the Magiſtrate, and he will do them Juſtice. If any man writes againſt their Immunities, the Prince only has Right to puniſh it, becauſe 'tis from his Grace and Liberality they
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:50981:135"/>
hold them, and 'tis he only can preſerve them: nor indeed is it agreeable that priviledg'd Perſons ſhould have the defence of their own Priviledges, or be Judges in their own Caſes. But there are few ſuch Libels in <hi>Italy</hi> to be ſeen, though new ones are diſperſed every day by the <hi>Romans</hi> againſt the Power of the Seculars, for zealous are they in the diminution of the ſecular Authority, and ſo furious in augmentation of their own.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the Eccleſiaſticks are not competent Judges of Books relating to Civil <hi>Government:</hi> it belongs to Princes who have <hi>States</hi> to govern, to approve or reject the Maxims contained in ſuch Books, ſeeing ſuch matters fall not under the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of Eccleſiaſticks, to whom God has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the medling in ſecular Affairs. Neither are they to be admitted Judges in Cauſes where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themſelves with ſo much paſſion, as to call Tyranny and humane Invention the power which God has given to ſecular Magiſtrates, and Hereſy and Blaſphemy that Doctrine which impugns their Opinions. Thus Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in one of his Books has the confidence to pronounce thoſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks who affirm Kings and Soveraign Princes to have no Superior in Temporal things but God. Inſomuch that to follow his Doctrine, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Romans,</hi> we muſt believe there is no Soveraign Power but in the <hi>Pope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, the <hi>Venetian</hi> ſuffers not the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> to cenſure Books of Love or Gallantry, though they contain many things of Honour, and good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; Firſt, becauſe the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> are inſtituted to judg of Hereſy, but not to cenſure Manners. Secondly, according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine, the publick Honour and Tranquility are entruſted with the Civil Magiſtrate. Thirdly, becauſe offences committed either by word or deed againſt the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50981:135"/>
reputation of another man, or againſt civil decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or <hi>decorum,</hi> or things indiſputably belonging to the ſecular Judg, and by conſequence the ſame offences in writing belong to the ſame Judges. And here it is worth obſervation, that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends not to Juriſdiction over Books that treat not of matter of Faith, but ſince the year 1550, and that this Uſurpation is turned into Cuſtom and Right by the negligence of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Italy,</hi> and their Miniſters, who ſhifting that care upon the Monks, inſenſibly deveſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of that part of their Authority, which they never perceived till it was too late to recover.</p>
                  <p>There has been no State, but the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> that has always diſcerned the importance of this caution, and by conſequence not ſuffered di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution in their ancient Rights: but the <hi>Venetian Miniſters</hi> continue to peruſe all the Books that are Printed, to the end that nothing may ſlip in of erroneous Doctrine, hindering likewiſe ſuch Books as have been Printed formerly, from being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed or expoſed to ſale, to prevent the increaſe of that miſchief which otherwiſe they might do.</p>
                  <p>Again, the Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> magnifies exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the Enterprizes of Juriſdiction made for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> affirming boldly in a Letter of the 13th of <hi>June</hi> 1605 to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to complain of his Miniſters for ſtopping the ſale of the Eleventh <hi>Tome</hi> of his <hi>Annals</hi> in the States of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Milan, That the</hi> Pope <hi>was the ſole lawful Judg of Books, and that therefore neither Princes nor any of their Miniſters could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn ſuch Works as his Holineſs had approved.</hi> To which the King replying, not by words, but deeds, and ſuffering the Prohibitions publiſhed by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to proceed, the ſaid Cardinal in his 12th
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:50981:136"/>
                     <hi>Tome</hi> printed 1607, added a Diſcourſe to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>That it was an horrid and impious thing for Kings or their Miniſters to cenſure ſuch Books as had been approved by the</hi> Pope, <hi>or to forbid the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners to ſell them. That it was to rob St.</hi> Peter <hi>of one of the Keys that Jeſus Chriſt had given him, that is to ſay, the knowledg that is to diſcern betwixt good and evil. And at length, that the Ministers of</hi> Spain <hi>had prohibited his Book, becauſe it reprehended the injuſtice of their Maſters.</hi> Which evidently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the paſſion of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> who think it lawful to ſpeak irreverently of Kings, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry their <hi>Government</hi> by invectives under the Cloke of Religion, whilſt Princes are not allowed Power to hinder the reading of ſuch Books in their own proper Dominions. What diſorder would it produce in the World, if the approbation that <hi>Popes</hi> for their own intereſt have given to Books written againſt the Secular Power, ſhould oblige all Princes to receive them? What could be more unreaſonable than to require a Book wherein the King is called Tyrant and Uſurper, his Anceſtors defamed, and his Subjects excited to Rebellion, ſhould be printed, read, and ſold publickly even in the Territory of the ſaid Prince? And yet this is no more than <hi>Baronius</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to, who after he had ſpake diſhonourably of ſeveral Kings of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and particularly of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> in his Diſcourſe of the <hi>Sicilian Monarchy,</hi> believed that <hi>Philip</hi> III had done him great injury not to permit the ſale of his Book, though full of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Baron.</hi> Tome 11. <hi>Ann. Eccl.</hi>
                     </note> acrimony, and invective againſt his Predeceſſors and Parents.</p>
                  <p>As it is undoubtedly true, a Book treating of matter of Faith, and licenſed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> cannot be condemned by any ſecular Power; ſo 'tis as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, a Book treating of Hiſtory or Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50981:136"/>
may as juſtly be prohibited by Princes, or their Miniſters, though licenſed by all the <hi>Prelats</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the Expedient <hi>Baronius</hi> propoſes of repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with humility to the Biſhops for ſuppreſſion of ſuch Books as the ſecular Magiſtrate ſhall judg pernicious or ſcandalous, I have ſaid already the Remedy is worſe than the Diſeaſe, ſeeing thereby the Eccleſiaſticks would make themſelves in a thouſand things that belong not to their Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Beſides, that <hi>Government</hi> would be very imperfect that had not in it ſelf power to provide what was neceſſary for its ſubſiſtance, but muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend till remedy be applied by thoſe whoſe intereſt it is to have the miſchief continued, and who will never addreſs themſelves to reform it, but as their own intereſt prompts them.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, in my judgment, Princes are not to rely upon the diligence of other People in things that concern the good of their State, God Almighty having given them Authority to ſecure themſelves. In ſhort, 'tis only the Prince under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands what is proper for his State, and therefore no reaſon he ſhould be beholding to the <hi>Pope</hi> for what he has of his own, which made <hi>John de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Valentia</hi> ſay, upon occaſion, <hi>That it would be madneſs to ſee</hi> Paris <hi>on fire, and to expect till water could be fetch'd from the</hi> Tyber <hi>to quench it, when the</hi> Seine <hi>was ſo near.</hi> The <hi>Venetian</hi> Policy is quite contrary to the Policy of the <hi>Pope:</hi> What is good for the Eccleſiaſtical State, is otherwiſe for the Civil: and if it were not, nothing could oblige the Civil State to conform; and therefore a Doctrine may be good at <hi>Rome,</hi> that may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious at <hi>Venice, Vienna, Madrid,</hi> and every where elſe. Wherefore the <hi>Pope</hi>'s approbation cannot deveſt Princes of their Authority to condemn ſuch
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50981:137"/>
Books as are likely (if not intended) to breed diſturbance in their States.</p>
                  <p>But the truth is, ſo far are <hi>Popes</hi> from being law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Judges of all manner of Books, that they have uſurped upon Seculars in the very power of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of Heretical Books. In the eight firſt Centuries all Books were examined, and cenſured by the Councils, but prohibited by Princes for reaſon of State. The <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> declared the Doctrine of <hi>Arius</hi> heretical, and then <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> by an Imperial Proclamation prohibited his Books.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> pronounc'd <hi>Eunomius</hi> an Heretick, and <hi>Arcudius</hi> the Emperor publiſhed an Edict againſt his Works.</p>
                  <p>The third Council of <hi>Epheſus</hi> condemned <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius,</hi> and the Emperor <hi>Theodoſius</hi> commanded his Books to be burned.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi> having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the <hi>Eutycheans,</hi> the Emperor <hi>Martianus</hi> publiſhed a Decree againſt their Books. Which ſhews that the prohibition even of heretical Books belongs not ſo properly to the Eccleſiaſtical, as to the Secular Power: for though the Eccleſiaſticks may judge whether there be Hereſy in a Book, it follows not but a Secular Prince may, by his Edict, forbid that Book that is cenſured by the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks, and they have no reaſon to complain that one of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Keys is taken from them; ſeeing the prohibition of a Prince gives more force and vigor to their cenſure.</p>
                  <p>As to the Stationer, the <hi>Senat</hi> conſents that thoſe who keep or ſell Heretical Books, be puniſhed by the <hi>Inquiſition:</hi> but it ſuffers not an Inventory of their Books be taken by the <hi>Inquiſitors;</hi> that they receive permiſſion to ſell them from the <hi>Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> nor that they give them an Oath; which
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50981:137"/>
the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> have endeavoured many times to obtain, as alſo to inſert into their Edicts Commands beyond their power, alledging that they pretend not to give an Oath to a Stationer, but for things to which their conſcience obliges them, that is to ſay, not to ſell prohibited Books; and that by their Edicts they only intend them advertiſement of what they ought not to do: but theſe are but cunning pretences, for to give an Oath, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe by Edict, (though in things that are juſt to be done) are acts of Superiority and Juriſdiction. Beſides, the Edict and Oath are things of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he who tranſgreſſes either againſt the one or the other, is worthy of puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>To theſe the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> add another reaſon, that ſeeing they are Judges of Hereſy, they ought (in conſequence) to judg every thing that relates to it, and therefore they have a right to command the Stationers, becauſe Hereſies are no way more dangerouſly diſſeminated than by Books.</p>
                  <p>To this the <hi>Venetian</hi> anſwers, That for Books which contain Hereſy, the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> have right to prohibit them, and puniſh the Stationer who ſells them; but for all other ſort of Books, the Stationer is not accountable to the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> nor to bring their Inventories before them. For 'tis but ill Logick to infer the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> may extend its Authority to all Books, becauſe Hereſy is often taught in Books, for all Books treat not of Faith, which is the only ſubject belonging to that ſacred Office, and therefore thoſe that treat not in that way, fall not under the Juriſdiction of that Court. If the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> were Judges of all that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Hereſy, though never ſo remotely, there would not be any Crime nor Error but might become matter for the <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> there would be no need of Civil Magiſtrates, and by degrees
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50981:138"/>
the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction would worm out the Secular.</p>
                  <p>There is but one point in which the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> ſeems to have over-ſhot her ſelf, and that is in having ſuffered the <hi>Popes</hi> to ſend forreign <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> among them, when their own Subjects might execute that Office with as much charity and diſcretion, as they who know nothing of the cuſtoms and practices of their Country. In <hi>Spain</hi> the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> are all <hi>Spaniards:</hi> in the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Milan</hi> the Natives are not excluded; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Venetian,</hi> in other things ſo jealous of their Authority, in this ſeems to be in worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, if it be conſidered that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors</hi> cannot be received into the Towns to which they are ſent, unleſs they firſt preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Prince for his Letters Patents directed to the <hi>Rectors</hi> of the place, it will be found the danger is not great, ſeeing that if an <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> be not liked, the Prince has the remedy in his hands, and that is by delaying (if not deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) his Patent, without which, his Patent from the <hi>Pope</hi> is ineffectual. Which is a good way of diſcouraging forreign Monks, by making difficulty to receive them; and this is a true ſecret (when they pleaſe) to oblige the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to name their <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> out of the Subjects of that State.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> hold their Court in the Palace of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> where they meet twice a week.</p>
                  <p>Such of the Aſſiſtants as have buſineſs with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> cannot remain in the ſacred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, their intelligence there rendring their fidelity ſuſpicious to the State, which puts others into their places. So the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> have no capacity to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:50981:138"/>
corrupt any of the Aſſiſtants, becauſe the Office of theſe Gentlemen ceaſes that very moment in which they addreſs for any favour from the <hi>Pope.</hi>

                  <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Cauſe of their decay is <hi>the ſlowneſs of their Councels.</hi> 'Tis true, this fault is common in all <hi>Commonwealths,</hi> but with them it may be ſaid to be in extremity, their <hi>Senat</hi> ſeeming ſometimes to be aſleep, with ſo much heavineſs and inactivity it moves upon ſeveral occaſions.

and fearing to precipitate themſelves by falſe Meaſures, into a War againſt which they thought themſelves ſafe by virtue of their Alliance, which they had lately renewed, they ſaw the Fortreſs of St. <hi>Theodore</hi> ſurprized; and the City of <hi>Canea</hi> beſieged, before they would believe their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey was to be the Theatre of the War, and the whole Charges to be defraied by them.

                  <p>The loſs of <hi>Canea</hi> drew after it the loſs of <hi>Retimo,</hi> and the Field.

                  <p>And here it is to be obſerved, the <hi>Venetians</hi> who are naturally very fearful and ſuperſtitious, were not ſo when they ſhould have been.

the face of the <hi>Venetian</hi> affairs quickly changed, and ſeveral of their Towns returned to their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
                  <p>The ſame thing almoſt happened before in the <hi>League</hi> that <hi>Pope Sixtus</hi> XII made againſt them <note place="margin">1483.</note> with the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Milan;</hi> and the <hi>Florentines,</hi> for <hi>Ferrara.</hi> For if <hi>Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick Sforza</hi> Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> had not left the <hi>League,</hi> the <hi>Venrtians</hi> (who had loſt their <hi>Fleet</hi> upon the <hi>Po,</hi> and all the Territory of <hi>Bergamo, Breſcia</hi> and <hi>Verona,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> Son to the King of <hi>Naples</hi> had taken from them) had without doubt been deprived of all their poſſeſſions in <hi>Lombardy.</hi> But upon Capitulation with <hi>Sforza,</hi> whoſe Quarrel they Eſpouſed againſt the <hi>Calabrians,</hi> who would turn him out of his Government of <hi>Milan,</hi> all was reſtored, without being obliged reciprocally to the reſtitution of the <hi>Poleſin</hi> to the Marqueſs of <hi>Ferrara:</hi> ſo that they who were vanquiſhed in the Field, were Victors in Council, and recovered all by their management of the Treaty. To which I ſhall add my Reflexions upon one thing the <hi>Senat</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> did after the loſs of <hi>Candia;</hi> by which the truth of what I have ſaid may be judged.</p>
                  <p>It was reſolved an extraordinary <hi>Council</hi> ſhould be held every Week for the carrying on of the War, which could hot be obtained at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by all the Remonſtrances of the <hi>Chevalier Molin,</hi> who very well underſtood the condition of their affairs; and yet moſt ridiculouſly, at an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable time, two Months after the Peace was concluded, this <hi>Council</hi> was ſet up, like a Phiſitian, who preſcribes after the Patient is dead, or like the <hi>Phrygeans,</hi> who aſſembled their <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> after the miſchief was happened, to conſider how they might have prevented it. The propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:50981:142"/>
made by the <hi>Senat,</hi> at the ſame time to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> to purchaſe the Towns of <hi>Friest Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſque,</hi> and <hi>Goretz,</hi> to repair their loſſes in the <hi>Levant,</hi> was as much out of time; <hi>For if they had Money to purchaſe more, it might as well have been laid out to keep what they had.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Third</hi> cauſe of the diſorder of their affairs, is, becauſe the <hi>Senat</hi> conſiſting of ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and their Affairs determined by plurality of Voices, ill Councels (provided they be covered with plauſible appearances) are oftner followed than good, which moſt commonly diſpleaſe, either from the difficulty of Execution; or becauſe the good or ill Conſequences are not generally fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen by ſeveral of the Members, who diſcern not what is True from what is Falſe, nor what is Convenient from what is Deſtructive: So that it is ſometimes at <hi>Venice,</hi> as <hi>Anacharſis</hi> ſaid it was formerly at <hi>Athens,</hi> where the Wiſe Conſulted, and the Weak Reſolved; for Voices are counted, not Reaſons conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note n="*" place="margin">

Thus did they conclude to League themſelves with <hi>Lewis</hi> XII, againſt <hi>Sforza</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> to have in Recompence the Town of <hi>Cremona,</hi> and the Countrey <hi>de la Ghiara d'Adda,</hi> becauſe the advantage was preſent; whereas the Graver of the <hi>Senators</hi> adviſed the contrary, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Principles of true Policy, not to drive out a Neighbouring Prince, to let in a more Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent into his place: and this occaſioned after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>League</hi> of <hi>Cambrey,</hi> which <hi>Melchior Treviſan</hi> had Prognoſticated before, telling them in full <hi>Senat, That the King of the</hi> Romans <hi>would</hi>

                     <hi>joyn more readily with the King of</hi> France <hi>againſt them, than with them againſt ſo powerful a King; becauſe united with</hi> France <hi>it would be eaſy for him to Conquer the</hi> Venetians, <hi>whereas with them, it would be very hard to prevail againſt</hi> France; <hi>and by conſequence, the</hi> Republick <hi>of</hi> Venice <hi>having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſo many Enemies upon their hands, they muſt either beat all the Princes of</hi> Europe, <hi>or be beaten by them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, there are thoſe in <hi>Venice,</hi> who to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Genius of the People, and ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves zealous for their Countrey, accomodate their Councels to the depraved Palats of others.

Or like thoſe obſtinate People, who will rather run the hazard

                  <p>They bear a hatred to any that are great with the People; the common inconvenience of an <hi>Ariſtocracie,</hi> where the <hi>Nobility</hi> living in conſtant Jealouſy and diſtruſt, every man fancies that his Companion deſigns by inſinuating with the People, to enſlave the <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> and this imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has cauſed the death of many a brave Perſon.

                  <p>The knowledg of the <hi>Venetians</hi> lies general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in underſtanding their own affairs: they trouble not their heads much with Books, beyond their own Hiſtories and Cuſtoms, and except ſome few Gentlemen who have been Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors abroad, or gone along in their Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, they are generally very little curious of forreign tranſactions.

Forreign Embaſſadors, they do not fear diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very from their Companions, nor by conſequence the Clamours of <hi>Embaſſadors,</hi> nor the Malice of their Maſters, which is an advantage they have above all other <hi>Commonwealths;</hi> And indeed, if the Hiſtorians of the laſt age do not wrong them, their manner of obſerving Treaties with <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. the <hi>Piſans, Hercules d'Eſte</hi> Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and ſome other <hi>States,</hi> is not much to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of their fidelity.

                  <p>They are ſober, whether out of Conſcience or Frugality let others judg, and do eat well at a good Meal, when it is at another man's coſt.

                  <p>They are much given to their pleaſures; and their Miſtreſſes are much more chargeable to them than their Wives, whom they uſe as their Servants.

                  <p>'Tis reported of them, that in the choice of their Generals they differ from all other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments in <hi>Europe,</hi> who generally make choice of Commanders that are Valiant and wiſe; but when any ſuch happens to be choſen, they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times give them ſuch rubs and mortifications, that they are quickly taken down, or elſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their Command, to ſave their reputation. For 'tis ſaid, that the great reaſon why Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:50981:151"/>
are entertained in thoſe Commands, is only to bear the blame, and that all miſcarriages of the War may be ſhifted upon them; which made <hi>Count Pettilano</hi> Complain, <hi>That the City of</hi> Venice <hi>was readier to find ſault, than to furniſh him with neceſſaries for their ſervice,</hi> &amp;c. To this may be added, That the young Noblemen put upon theſe Generals as Companions, under the Title of <hi>Proveditors-General,</hi> are ſo jealous of their Authority, that they do often chooſe rather to ruin and ſpoil all by following their own heads, than to ſucceed never ſo well by the Wiſdom and good Conduct of a Stranger. <hi>Pia toſto</hi> (ſaid one of thoſe Nobles in a <hi>Council of War) vog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio errare da me, che far bene con il parere de gle alteri:</hi> and where this has been their practice, they have thriven accordingly.</p>
                  <p>They eaſily believe whatever they deſire, and good News, though falſe, is always welcom to them; and therefore they gave more credit to the Reports given out by the <hi>Turks,</hi> that they would beſiege <hi>Malta,</hi> than to their Advice from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to look to the defence of <hi>Candia:</hi> Nay the <hi>Senat</hi> forbad the Nobility to ſpeak of that War, under the penalty of Baniſhment; which Order, and the Impriſonment of ſome Perſons for the ſame, did but the more frighten the People <note n="*" place="margin">Facili Civitate ad creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dà omnia nova, cum triſtia ſunt.</note>, who are eaſy to believe any thing they apprehend. During the Siege of <hi>Candia</hi> they made them believe ſometimes that the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> ſometimes the <hi>Grand Viſior</hi> was dead, and ſometimes that <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was revolted, <hi>Credula ſamà inter Gaudentes, &amp; incurioſos.</hi> For they muſt be flattered in their diſtreſſes, and many times the vanity of their hopes make them neglect the application of ſeaſonable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>

The Miniſters of Princes are always ſuſpected by them, eſpecially if they find them wiſe and cloſe, as People harder to be managed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded than the reſt. At their firſt coming, the <hi>Senat</hi> cauſes all their Diſcourſe and all their Actions to be ſtrictly obſerved, in order to diſcover their parts and diſpoſitions; and the better to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in this deſign, they ſound them ſometimes by affronts offered to their Retinue, ſometimes by cunning and inſidious propoſitions; ſometimes one way, ſometimes another, and all to perplex and experiment his Prudence.</p>
                  <p>Thus they tried the <hi>Count d'Argenſon,</hi> cauſing it to be asked him at his Entry, whether he would be received at the Abby of St. <hi>George</hi> not far from the Town, pretending to ſave him the labour of going to the <hi>Saint Eſprit</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">An Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey three miles from <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> where the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors from Crowned Heads are received.</note>, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the badneſs of the Weather that day: But the cunning Embaſſador replied, <hi>That he was not come thither to loſe any of the Rights, or leſſen any thing of the Honours of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage; and that if he were to go as far as</hi> Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ozza, <hi>or farther, neither Rain nor Snow ſhould hinder him.</hi> At the beginning of the <hi>Preſident de St. Andrew's</hi> Embaſſy, four of his <hi>Gondo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieres</hi> carrying certain Merchants Goods out of the Town in the night, were intercepted by the <hi>Saffs</hi> or Guards at the Town's end, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their Livery, or the name of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, which they often repeated, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there is no place where Embaſſadors are uſed with more formality than in <hi>Venice:</hi> which makes wiſemen imagine, it was done by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Orders from the <hi>Senat,</hi> to take off the mind of that Miniſter from enquiring after their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in <hi>Candia,</hi> (which at that time were in a very ill poſture) by imploying it about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50981:152"/>
this affront. And I remember that being in diſcourſe one day with a Gentleman of parts, who had much acceſs to the chief <hi>Senators,</hi> and ſpeaking of that buſineſs, he let fall this Expreſſion, after ſeveral other Reaſons that he had given, <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Again, the <hi>Venetians</hi> are apt to be jealous of all Embaſſadors, and to interpret all their Actions as Myſteries tending to Conſpiracy. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fcant upon his walking abroad upon his ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at home; upon his abſence from Chappel, upon any word that falls ſuddenly from him, and a Thouſand other things, from whence they make great conjectures, and draw mighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of <hi>State.</hi> One ſingle <hi>Vive la France</hi> by ſome <hi>Italian</hi> Foot-men in the <hi>French</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador's Equipage, as he was going home from a <hi>Ball</hi> at the Secretary of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s Lodgings, was enough to put the whole Town in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, as if it had been a new Conſpiracy of <hi>la Queva,</hi> when-as it was indeed nothing but the Hectoring of Foot-men in revenge of an
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:50981:152"/>
affront which they had received during the <hi>Ball.</hi> A little journey of that Embaſſadors to the Lady of <hi>Lauretto,</hi> was interpreted a calling back into <hi>France,</hi> and a ſilent Rupture with that King, though the night before his departure, the ſaid Embaſſador gave notice of it to the <hi>Colledg.</hi> And whileſt he was abſent all the World could not diſabuſe them, though otherwiſe they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too cunning to be impoſed upon by any other.</p>
                  <p>They have a great vanity to be thought good Juſticiaries, and to that end, upon Holy-days they give publick Audience in the Galleries of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> whilſt the Courts are ſitting, to ſhew that no day can hinder them from doing Juſtice, and that the Temple thereof is as conſtantly open as that of the <hi>Romans</hi> was of old. But there are two things generally complained of in their Judicature; One is, that few of them are verſed in their Laws, and what they do, is only in a common road that is beaten by every body; The other, that upon any Offence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn People to the Galleys, as well for trifles as for the greateſt Crimes, according to their intereſt, that is, to their Neceſſity for Rowers: and this is the reaſon why ſo few People are Executed, neither are they more ſcrupulous for Baniſhment, and Confiſcation of Eſtates. For there needs not much reaſon of <hi>State</hi> againſt thoſe who are rich, eſpecially if of the Nobility upon the <hi>Terra-firma.</hi> And I remember when the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador viſited the Countrey-Houſes betwixt <hi>Vicenza</hi> and <hi>Verona,</hi> he never enquired for the Maſters of the Houſes, leſt they ſhould have been anſwered, he is Baniſhed, or Proſcribed. Some of them are ſo puffed up with their Nobility,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:50981:153"/>
that they think themſelves equal with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Princes: witneſs that Nobleman who at <hi>Paris</hi> had the Confidence to ſay, he was as good a man as <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Kings only Brother. And one of an eminent Family, who thought all People were to give him place, becauſe he was a Nobleman of <hi>Venice;</hi> which made him be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo ill, that he carries the marks thereof to this day: For which reaſon he refuſed an Embaſſy into <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For their better juſtification they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Princes, and will not think themſelves miſtaken, when they find a deſcent of <hi>Roman Conſuls, Kings,</hi> and <hi>Emperours</hi> in their Pedegrees; for of all the <hi>Italians</hi> they are the moſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with <hi>Chimera</hi>'s concerning their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. The <hi>Contarini</hi> deduce themſelves in a direct line from <hi>Cotta</hi> Governour, or <hi>Count Palatin</hi> of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> The <hi>Moroſini</hi> bring their Original out of <hi>Hungary</hi> from a City of that name. The <hi>Juſtiniani</hi> derive them from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of that name; and diſclaim their relation to the <hi>Juſtiniani</hi> of <hi>Genoa,</hi> who were Popular before the Reformation of that Government. The <hi>Cornari</hi> derive themſelves from the <hi>Cornelii</hi> in <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Quirini</hi> claim deſcent from the Illuſtrious <hi>Roman</hi> Family of the <hi>Sulpitii,</hi> and as ſuch they reckon the Emperour <hi>Galba</hi> for one of their Anceſtors.

                  </p>
                  <p>Though all their Nobility make but one Body, yet there is no neceſſity they ſhould all have the ſame principle and humour. The ancient Nobility have a ſtrong averſion to the new,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:50981:153"/>
whom they deſpiſe, and on the other ſide are as much hated by them in revenge. The firſt deſire War, to have the Honour and Profit of it, becauſe the chief Commands belong ſolely to them: The other are conſequently for Peace, as that which keeps up their Equality, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as War makes their Companions more haughty and proud. The Ancient Nobility decline all Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſies as chargeable and troubleſom; the New are ambitious of them, as a true way to make themſelves known in the World; aſpiring more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to the <hi>Dogeſhip,</hi> to Illuſtrate their Families by the ſupremacy of that Office, whilſt the Ancient Nobility reject it as a Clog, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Servitude. The Ancient love to have their reſidence in <hi>Venice,</hi> where they have all the great Offices; the New affect imployment abroad, to rid themſelves of the Contempts and Contradictions of the Ancients, who pervert e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing they do, and turn it into <hi>Ridicule;</hi> For in the <hi>Provinces</hi> where there is nothing but Subjects, the New Nobility are chief, and muſt be honoured as they pleaſe. In a word, whilſt theſe are delighted with Equality. which the Ancients cannot bear, both parties live in ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity like the <hi>Caſtelans</hi> and <hi>Nicolotes</hi> among the Common People. And perhaps this diviſion contributes to the ſafety of the Government, the Ancient Nobility and the New watching one anothers Actions perpetually, ſo that neither can do amiſs. For which cauſe, whenever the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors of State,</hi> or <hi>Council of ten</hi> are inquiring into the Adminiſtrations of the one, the other will be ſure to put to their Shoulder to tumble them down: and the Faction of the New were very near ruining General <hi>Moroſini</hi> when he was
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:50981:154"/>
accuſed by the <hi>Avogador Corraro.</hi> And upon theſe advantages the Nobility do frequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their private averſions.</p>
                  <p>The Nobles of the <hi>Colony</hi> of <hi>Candia</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible to both; their hatred is without any other cauſe than an old animoſity which the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> have retained againſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> with whom they have had ſeveral Wars: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is reckoned a great injury to a Nobleman of <hi>Venice</hi> to ſay he is a <hi>Greek,</hi> and they'l take it more kindly to be called by a worſe name. Upon this ſcore a Gentleman of the Houſe of <hi>Dandolo</hi> thought himſelf highly abuſed in a Health which one of the <hi>Contarini</hi> began to him in <hi>Candian</hi> Wine, with theſe words, <hi>Seignior Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolo, Brindeſi in Greco,</hi> which the ſaid <hi>Dandolo</hi> took as a reflexion upon the place of his birth. And here I muſt hint by the by, that a Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> does not love Raillery, and that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of a Jeſt never goes out of their Heads, eſpecially if it has any thing in it of truth. In my time two of the Illuſtrious <hi>Senators,</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon one anothers <hi>Gloves,</hi> one told the other, <hi>Caro Seignior, i voſtri guanti hanno le dita ben corte, Eli mei hanno ben lunge.

Though at home they live frugally and nearly, in their forreign Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polyments they are ſplendid enough, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in their Embaſſies, where they will ſpare nothing that is for the ſervice or honour of their Countrey, whoſe Face and Authority they may be ſaid to carry along with them <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>'Tis with marvellous eaſe and facility that they diſcern the Methods of all Courts to which they are ſent; and there are but few People ſo quick and well diſpoſed for Negotiation; there being ſeldom any thing ſo knotty and intricate, but they will find ſome expedient or another to weather it. In <hi>Paris,</hi> they are <hi>French,</hi> at <hi>Madrid, Spaniſh,</hi> and Natural <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi> as if they were born only for that place where their Reſidence is appointed, or had ſtript themſelves of their Countrey-Faſhions, to put on the humour of Strangers: and therefore they ſeldom fail of one thing that is not eaſily lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that is of ingratiating with the Prince
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:50981:155"/>
to whom they are ſent, which a great States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man pronounced to be a great ſign of their Wiſdom who can do it <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>Though they are naturally ambitious, yet with great quietneſs they lay down the Command of their Armies, and return as contentedly to their private affairs, as if they never had had the whole Power of their Countrey in their hands, or at leaſt were very glad to be diſcharged of the burthen. So that we may ſay of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> as <hi>Theopompus</hi> ſaid of <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> That the great reaſon why they had laſted ſo long under one Government, was their Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens knowing ſo well how to obey. They are very ſecret and cloſe, not only in their State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affairs, but in every thing wherewith they are intruſted, which they will never diſcover, though afterwards they fall out and become Enemies. They are People of great Order, Providence, and Judgment, and if compared with the reſt of the <hi>Italians,</hi> they will be conſiderable as well for their own Virtues as for the Vices of their Neighbours. And Laſtly, amongſt their Moral and Civil qualifications, they have much of Chriſtianity. The multitude and Magnificence of their Churches, prove their Piety and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, whatever their Calumniators ſay to the contrary, as that they are generally <hi>Marſilians,</hi> and deny the Immortality of the Soul: but 'tis without any reaſon that they aſperſe them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be from the defamatory Libels publiſhed againſt them by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> whilſt they were under <hi>Paul</hi> V. Excommunication. Their
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:50981:155"/>
Hoſpitals, the beſt endowed in all <hi>Italy,</hi> ſpeak their Liberality and Alms, eſpecially that which they call <hi>La Pieta,</hi> in which all expoſed Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are provided for with great Care, though ſometimes their number has been ſo great as to amount to 6000. In which thing they have expreſſed great Gratitude to God, and Mercy to Mankind, by ſaving or rather giving new life to thouſands of poor innocent Babes, thrown daily by the Courteſans into the <hi>Canals</hi> of the Town, where without this proviſion they would certainly periſh. In a word the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> having had many Friends, and Hiſtorians that have wirt their Praiſes more Copiouſly, and more Elegantly than I, I ſhall add no more; what I have already ſaid being in my opinion fully ſufficient. <note place="margin">Ex ungue Leonem.</note>

Not long after, this Victory was followed by another, that is, by the taking of the Cities of <hi>Carolo, Grada,</hi> and <hi>Chiozza</hi> by <hi>Peter Doria,</hi> of whom I have ſpoken before.

               <hi>Franciſco Moroſini</hi> was accuſed by the <hi>Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gador Antonio Corraro</hi> of having ſurrendered <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> without Order from the <hi>Senat,</hi> and of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made a diſhonourable Peace that he called in his ſpeech <hi>Pace moſtruoſa concluſa ſenz' autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, ſentita con amarezza, Pace ſenza cantare,</hi> Te Deum. <hi>An abominable Peace, concluded without Authority, and received without Joy: a Peace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of a</hi> Te Deum. By virtue of which the ſaid <hi>Avogador</hi> moved that he might be ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the <hi>Procuratorſhip</hi> till he had cleared himſelf of his Charge.

Sagrede</hi> in an Oration in his behalf, ſaid, <hi>That</hi> Corraro <hi>imitated the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>who Sacrificed to their Gods innocent Victims for the Graces they received from them, for being honoured with the Office of an</hi> Avogador,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:50981:165"/>
               <hi>he, in acknowledgment, would Sacrifice an innocent Citizen, who with his Sword in his hand had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended his Country for the ſpace of</hi> 26 <hi>years. That it was hard to ſuſpend him his</hi> Procuratorſhip <hi>now, after he had poſſeſſed it peaceably</hi> 14 <hi>Months. That he ſhould have oppoſed himſelf againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the</hi> Grand-Council <hi>when it was given him; But having conſented then to his election, it was unjuſt to diſpoſſeſs him now, before he was convicted a Criminal.</hi> Concluding with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who never medled with the Garment of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> till after he was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. <hi>Eli Ebrei</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>volſero ſerbare gli ordini della giuſtitia; Lo conduſſero inanzi a Giu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici, lo preſentacono a</hi> Caifus <hi>&amp; a</hi> Pilato; <hi>e vero che lo ſpoglianno della Veſte, e ſe la diviſero, ma non gliela levarono, ſi non doppo Crocefiſſo. The</hi> Jews <hi>obſerving the due methods of Juſtice, carried him into the</hi> Judgment Hall, <hi>preſented him before</hi> Caiphas <hi>and</hi> Pilat, <hi>and though they ſtripped him, and divided his Garment, they did not do it till after he was Crucified. Corraro</hi> replying in the next <hi>Counſil,</hi> flew out into ſuch invectives againſt <hi>Sagredi,</hi> that he called him Poiſoned-tongue, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him he was like the <hi>Roman Orator</hi> who was eſteemed more Eloquent than Honeſt, <hi>Proſperiore Eloquentiae quam Morum fama.</hi> Tac.

            <p>Their next <hi>Excommunication</hi> was for Invading <hi>Ferrara,</hi> which <hi>Pope Clement</hi> V. would have had; and to take off this <hi>Excommunication, Francis Dandoli</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſador, threw himſelf at the <hi>Popes</hi> Feet, loaden with Chains and Irons like a Thief and a Slave, by which means he
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:50981:166"/>
prevailed for their Abſolution. This ſhews how much they formerly apprehended the cenſures of the Church. But the <hi>Venetians</hi> now-a-days are not ſo tender, ſince they have conſidered that the <hi>Popes</hi> make uſe of their Spiritual Arms upon Temporal occaſions, a thing that of late years have rendered their cenſures very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible. <hi>Haec poena, ex quo</hi> Romani <hi>Pontifices dirarum prodigi fuere, minus virium habuit,</hi> Pap.

            <p>Their third <hi>Excommunication</hi> was by <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. who grown jealous of their proceedings, was forced to <hi>Excommunicate</hi> them, and joyn with the other Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> to make them give over the Siege of <hi>Ferrara.</hi>

            <p>Their laſt <hi>Excommunication</hi> was by <hi>Paul</hi> V. in the year 1605, upon the Impriſonment of two Eccleſiaſticks, and for ſome <hi>Edicts</hi> of their <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat,</hi> which he pretended were contrary to the liberty and immunities of the Church; but it was done with ſo little ſucceſs and ſatisfaction, that ſince that time the <hi>Popes</hi> have been very cautious of renewing thoſe kind of quarrels, as ſerving only to inſenſe the Princes againſt them, and leſſen their Veneration for the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>The ſecond was the War with <hi>Cyprus,</hi> under the <hi>Dukes Peter Loredan,</hi> and <hi>Lewis Moccenigue.</hi> This whole <hi>Iſland</hi> was taken by <hi>Muſtapha Baſſa</hi> General to <hi>Selymus,</hi> who cauſed the Valiant <hi>Marc-Antonio Bragadin</hi> to be flea'd alive, and the Head of <hi>Seignior Aſtor de Baillon</hi> to be cut off.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Chevalier</hi> attended by 60 <hi>Senators</hi> goes to meet the ſaid <hi>Embaſſador</hi> at the Church of the <hi>Abbey de S.

               <p>Entring into the Palace the <hi>Chevalier</hi> keeps himſelf on the Left-hand of the <hi>Embaſſador,</hi> who at his going out gives him the Right, as all Servants do to the <hi>Senators.</hi> The next morning the ſame Company come again to his Palace, and he receives them on the middle of the Stairs, giving the Right-hand to the <hi>Chevalier,</hi> as all
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:50981:174"/>
his Officers do to the reſt of the <hi>Senators.</hi> But when the <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> goes out, he takes the the Right-hand again, and his Equipage of the <hi>Senators,</hi> and in that Order marches to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in the <hi>Colledg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he enters, he Salutes the Aſſembly three times.
