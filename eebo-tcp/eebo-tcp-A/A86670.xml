            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

is no tranſgreſſion proved, there can be no Law added, and we who ſuffer here in <hi>Norwich,</hi> there is nothing proved againſt us that comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the breach of the Law: For as I was moved of the Lord, I came to <hi>Wymondham,</hi> and in the Meeting houſe, when the Prieſt had ended, and all the people ſilent, I ſpoke the Word of the Lord to them, in love to their ſouls, and for the deliverance of the ſeed of God out of captivity, and for this I was ſent to <hi>Bridwell,</hi> and the next day being called before the Magiſtrate, but nothing was proved againſt me, though he accuſed me of ſomething which I ſpoke not, nor none did prove it againſt me, and he himſelf confeſſed that he did not hear me ſpeak that he accuſed me of, though he himſelf was in the multitude, and heard as the reſt did. Then he asked me if I would promiſe him not to come in the publick Meeting houſe again in the like manner, and I ſhould have my Liberty to meet in Town, or where I would: I Anſwered, if I was moved of the Lord to come thither again, I ſhould come, and when I did tranſgreſſe or do any wrong, let him add the Law upon me, for there is no Law in the Nation that doth binde any from coming to the Publick meeting houſe, who come in the ſame manner as I did, to declare the Word of the Lord freely to the people, then in his will he made a <hi>mittimus,</hi> and ſent me to priſon, and the next day by his own warrant diſcharged me of all that was laid to my charge in the <hi>Mittimus,</hi> and yet I am kept in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon nothing juſtly being charged againſt me, having ſuffered impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above ten weeks, and ſince I was committed was called before the Magiſtrates, and the Maior, and before the Committees who ſit as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Law, and nothing they could finde worthy of bonds, nor that I had broken the Law, yet did not ſet me at liberty, but keeps me ſtill in priſon, and I being ſhut up in a hole amongſt thieves, and not ſuffered to have my Liberty Publickly; I am moved of the Lord to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it publickly, that all Rulers, Magiſtrates and people in the Nation may ſee that in ſtead of the Law, perſecution is acted, where three of the ſervants of the Lord is now impriſoned in <hi>Norwich,</hi> one becauſe he would not Promiſe to come in the Steeple-houſe again to declare the Word of the Lord; and another is committed by a <hi>Mittimus,</hi> and the ſubſtance of that charged againſt him in it, is, That he ſaid, he came to declare the Truth, and another becauſe he declared againſt him and ungodlineſſe openly in the ſtreets: Oh, be aſhamed all the powers of the earth, who have ſet your ſelves againſt the mighty power of God, who is now coming to diſcover you, and lay you naked, who by the Light of God are ſeen, and to the children of Light are made manifeſt,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168007:2"/>
though your deceits hath laid hid and covered long, both Prieſts and Magiſtrates: but now are ye diſcovered by the Light, and the Life is come to try you, and now you are found to perſecute the Saints, which you profeſſed your ſelves to be, till you were proved and tryed by the Light, as now you are; Praiſes eternall be to the Lord God for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
            <p>Now theſe things being acted in the name of the Law, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent government, and Lord Protector, and Rulers and heads of the Nation, being ignorant of what tyranny and perſecution is acted pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately in their Names; Therefore I am moved of the Lord to declare it Publictly, that the heads and Rulers of the nation may ſee and conſider whether any ſuch tyranny be Protected to be ſet up in the Nation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Law of juſtice; for the innocent doth cry for equity and juſtice in their Courts and Seſſions, but in ſtead thereof tyranny, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and cruelty, ſo having diſcharged my duty in clearing my conſcience to you before the Lord: The ſin lyes at your doores, who hath a power put into your hands, if you do not improve it in breaking the bondes of wickedneſſe, and ſetting the oppreſſed free: for the Law of juſtice and equity we own, and have deſired to be tryed by, but are denyed it by thoſe called Juſtices of Peace: and here to you and all the world we declare the Truth, and are not afraid of the faces of men, who would devour us, for we have no mans perſon in admiration for advantage nor ſelf ends, but in plainneſſe and ſingleneſſe of heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the truth, reſpecting no mans perſon, but do honour all men in the Lord, but not with eye ſervice as men pleaſers, but in ſingleneſſe of heart do we all things as unto the Lord.</p>

               <p>The cauſe of my coming I did declare before one of your Juſtices called, and was examined before him; I told him it was to ſee a friend in the Caſtle, who was Priſoner there, and after I had been there with him was moved to go where their Miniſter of the Law, called, was ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a houſe neer the Caſtle, who ſaid little unto me, becauſe it was undenyable that a ſpoke, who own Juſtice, and reaſoned with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the ſame room of the things of God, and ſo came and was paſſing out of the City a quarter of a mile, the Word of the Lord came to me, Thou muſt go back again, and witneſſe forth my Name in their Market among the people, and at his command I was obedient, and went and declared forth that was given me to ſpeak amongſt them, which made the people aſtoniſhed, and many did follow me as you call them, rude, in running to hear the Truth declared forth in the Market, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of Chriſt, who reaſoned in the Markets dayly, and went from Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to City, preaching the Goſpel of the Kingdom, and were perſecuted from city to city, this is called diſturbance now as it was then, and what peace did I break, going on declaring forth the Truth, which none could object againſt that heard it, and by your Officers called, as he ſaid, he might know the ground why I ſpoke ſo, and ſhewed him I was commanded of the Lord, and being brought by him before one juſtice called, was examined, and could not find me by his Law a tranſgreſſor, and bade him carry me to the Maior, and he did ſo, and he did examine me upon the grounds of my faith, and of my outward means, where

               <p>To theſe things, for which I am accuſed, and am impriſoned by the Rulers of this City, I am bold to declare the truth, that out of Countries and kinreds hath the Lord redeemed me, and called me forth to declare his name abroad, for which cauſe I am apprehended as a Vagrant, though my habitation and being is known in the earth, and for declaring his name abroad who hath thus called me, am I brought before Rulers, and caſt into priſon for teſtifying the life and power of that which they themſelves profeſſe in words, who thus impriſoneth and perſecuteth the righteous ſeed of God where it is brought forth. And here let the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of <hi>Norwich</hi> be witneſſes againſt themſelves, that they are of that generation that put our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to death, by a law in their own wills, contrary to the will of God: and what would they have ſaid of Chriſt, who had no habitation in the earth, no not ſo much as to lay his head, if they had been in his dayes; by this Law he might have been perſecuted and impriſoned, and him they doe perſecute and impriſon, in ſo much as they doe it unto the leaſt of his, they doe it unto him, as it is made manifeſt; and if they had been in the times of the Apoſtles, whoſe words they doe profeſſe, would they not have perſecuted them by this law, who ſaid they had no certain dwelling place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 11. and the world was not worthy of them, and ſuch doe they perſecute now as are redeemed from the world, and by it ſuffer continually.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cain</hi> was a Vagabond, who ſlew his brother, and ſuch as live in anger and envy, ſuch hath no habitation in God, but ſuch actions and beaſtly nature we deny, and are redeemed from ſuch things, and our habitation is in God; and here let the Rulers of <hi>Norwich</hi> ſtop their mouthes and be aſhamed, who are found perſecutors of the Saints of the moſt high God, without the breach or colour of any law, or any tranſgreſſion ſaid juſtly to our charge, who are free born Engliſh men, whoſe Country and habitation we declared, and yet in their Mittimus doth deny it.</p>
               <p>And whereas I am accuſed of gathering multitudes of rude people together, it is falſe, as the City of <hi>Norwich</hi> ſhall teſtifie, for I was quietly in a houſe with them that were my friends, and I did not goe forth into their ſtreets, but the rude multitude came in, which they and the Prieſts call Chriſtians, and broke the peace, and this the Mayor of the Town
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:168007:5"/>
came in and ſaw, who ſaid, there was no revelation now, but of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and ſo denyeth both Chriſt and the Scriptures, which ſaith, No man knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal him; Now let all judge whether he be fit to rule for God, who denyes the Covenant of God, who gave him for a Covenant and a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the People, and the Maior coming in to our Meeting, where the rude multitude was, as he cals it, had nothing where of to accuſe us, but deſired me in love to come to him the next day, which I did, and by a warrant without any examination, I was ſent to priſon for a time, till I was called to examination again, being free from the breach of any Law am I here retained in priſon for witneſſing forth a good conſcience before God and man, thus to all the world have I cleared my conſcience in the preſence of the Lord, that what I ſuffer is for righteouſneſſes ſake, without the breach of any Law, and ſo I remain a ſufferer this day for the Teſtimony of Jeſus who am a ſervant to the Truth, and a Friend of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Commonwealth.</p>
