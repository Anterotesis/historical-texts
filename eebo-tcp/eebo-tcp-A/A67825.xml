            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> JOHN xvi. 31, 32.</bibl>
               <q>Do ye now believe? Behold the hour cometh,
yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered,
every man to his own, and shall leave me
alone.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS Day in the Kalendar of the Church
bears the name of Rogation-Sunday, as
being the Head of a Season set apart for
more than ordinary Prayers and Supplications
unto God. The Calamities of a Particular
Church begun the Usage; but the Piety of the
Universal thought fit to continue it, as well to
deprecate the like Calamities, as also to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
more instantly the Spiritual Presence of
Christ with his Church, at the same time when
we contemplate his bodily absence by reason of
his Ascension.</p>
            <p>Suitable to this purpose, there is a Gospel se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
for the Day, in which our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
treats of the Nature and Efficacy of Prayer.
Being now about to leave his Disciples he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107261:3"/>
Prayer to be to them (as it were) the
Equivalent of Himself; to supply them with all
the Consolations of his own Presence; and so
to fill up their Joy, that they should want none,
tho' he were away: <q>
                  <hi>Ask</hi> (says he) <hi>and you shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that your Ioy may be full.</hi>
               </q> For he tells them,
that tho' he was going from them, He was only
going to the Father, and there to be their Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
and to secure a Return to all their Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<q>Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name
he shall give it you.</q> Besides this, He tells them,
that the Father himself loved them, and that the
Comforter should come and abide with Them,
till such time as They should come and abide
with Himself in the Mansions of Heaven. The
Disciples having their Affections rais'd and made
warm by this obliging Discovery, immediately
declare themselves Believers, convinc'd, enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
satisfied: <q>Now we are sure that Thou knowest
all Things; Now we Believe that Thou camest forth
from God.</q> To which our Saviour makes this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
in the Text, <q>Do ye now believe? Behold the
hour cometh, yea is now come, that, &amp;c.</q> 
            </p>
            <p>Which words may be distinguish'd into Two
general Parts, (<hi>viz.</hi>) The Rebuke of a Present
fault in the Disciples, and The Warning of a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The first words, <hi>Do ye now believe?</hi> is a
manifest Rebuke; and it may seem to charge the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107261:3"/>
Faith that the Disciples had now profest with a
Three-fold Defect, That it was Late, That it was
Cheap, and That it was Mistaken: For each of
These may be naturally infer'd from the import
of the Question. (<hi>ex. gr.</hi>)</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Do ye now believe?</hi> But why did ye not
believe sooner? Have you not had sufficient
means of Conviction till now? Have you not
long since seen my Miracles, and heard my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine?
Have I not told you heretofore, that <hi>I
came forth from the Father,</hi> and that <hi>I and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are one?</hi> wherefore your Faith is reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
for that it is so Late.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Do ye now believe?</hi> But what does it
cost You to do so? What temptation have you
to the contrary? Your Faith now only lays hold
of my Promises, and is not at all discourag'd by
any of your own Fears: For what Difficulties are
you brought to? What Peril do you run by this
private Confession of me? And therefore your
Faith is not to be boasted of, 'tis rather reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
for that it is so Cheap.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Do ye now believe?</hi> i. e. Are you sure
you do believe? Do you not think too indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
of your selves? Have you examin'd your
own hearts, and secur'd the Grounds of your
Confidence? Indeed <hi>you seem to your selves</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
but I (who know you better than you do
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107261:4"/>
your selves) find that you do not believe as you
ought: For a true Faith will never be a Deserter;
but you will by and by desert me: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your Faith is reproachable, for that it is so
mistaken.</p>
            <p>Perhaps all these Three Defects were to be
found in the present Faith of the Disciples, at
least in some measure: But I am sure they are
actually and ordinarily found in the Faith of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Professors; and therefore let us make some
short Reflections upon them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Upon the Lateness of their Faith. None
may deny, but that the Disciples did believe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
They had made the same Confession before:
But yet we must acknowledge that their Faith
was hitherto weak and labouring and perplex'd.
And the Reason of all, was the Prejudice they
were bred in, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That the Messiah was to set
up a Worldly Kingdom. So that when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
discours'd to them concerning Persecution
and the Cross, tho' the Veneration they had for
his awful Goodness, would not suffer them to
disbelieve what he said; yet their rooted belief
of another thing inconsistent with this, could not
but hold their Faith under an intricate suspence:
But now (This Evening) our Saviour had by a
more free and full Discovery weeded this Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
out of their Minds: He had satisfi'd them
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107261:4"/>
that the Messiah's Kingdom was Heavenly; That
the Redemption by Him was Moral, not from
Suffering, but from Sin; That the World, and
They, were of different Families, different Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
different Fortunes: From which Discovery
their Faith grew consistent, it no longer contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
it self; and therefore it was now profest,
as if it were perfectly New; <hi>Now we Believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us observe from hence, That, No Man
can have an approvable or steady Faith, till such
time as he has rendred himself Indifferent to the
World. When GOD trained up <hi>Abraham,</hi> as a
Pattern to those that should afterwards Believe,
be began with him at this Point, He was to take
God for his All: God was to be to him instead
of Country, and Friends, and all other Interests:
God was to be to him both his <hi>Shield</hi> and his
<hi>Reward; i. e.</hi> For him to have sought for either
any Deliverances, or any Advantages, but such
as perfectly comported with his Relyance upon
God, had been absolute Infidelity in him: And
the same it must be in us. The same God offers
himself to us in the Gospel, but together with
his Cross; So that all Worldly Comforts, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that of Internal Peace, are absolutely contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
to our Covenant; And if we will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Him upon these Terms, we are already
judg'd unworthy of Him. He then is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107261:5"/>
Believer who has set down and consider'd,
what expence he can be at for Salvation: who
has put Temporal and Eternal good things into
different Scales, and weigh'd them apart; and
then resolved which to chuse, tho' perhaps they
were never to meet, from the moment of his
Choice: Who can say to himself—<q>I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
to follow my Master, and this is the
only point I aim at: I will therefore be humble
and charitable and inoffensive; I will be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
in my Desires, and Temperate in my
Enjoyments, Honest in my Dealings, and
Faithful to my Promises; I will not Strain my
Conscience in hopes of Advantage, nor be
wanting to Truth for fear of Disobliging:
These are the only Arts of Living, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be acquainted with, and if it shall please
God to bless these to me with worldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
I know my self obliged to greater
Thankfulness for my present Comforts; but
yet, if these fail, I will not be less Thankful
for my future assurances.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is a Faith founded upon a Rock: But he
whose Piety varies and fluctuates according to
the different faces of the World; that swells at
Gain, and ebbs at Loss, and sometimes sinks ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the calm of Pleasures, or under the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Affliction; such a one is (as the Apostle
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107261:5"/>
expresses him) <q>like a wave of the sea, driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
and tossed; let him not expect to receive any
thing from the Lord.</q> In a word, It is worldly
adherences that make men late Believers; nay,
occasions that multitudes who in view of a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
Faith have renounced the world from
their Cradle, have not yet arrived at that Faith
(then presumed on) to their Graves.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Second thing to be reflected on is the
Cheapness of the Disciples Faith; and that must
be estimated from the encouragements that they
had just then received: They had just received
full assurances of their Master's endearment, of
the Love of the Father, of the Cohabitation of
the Spirit, of the Income of their Prayers, of a
Future eternal Reward: And no wonder if the
warmth of such encouragements as these made
their Faith spring up to a <hi>promising blade;</hi> but
yet we see that for want of a <hi>deeper root</hi> the next
Trial made it <hi>wither.</hi> Let us observe from
hence—Never to trust that Religion that grows
from an occasional Complacency or Elevation
of Spirits. A good Humour makes a good
Christian very cheaply, but very deceitfully:
While we contemplate the indulgent Love of
Christ, and the precious Promises of the Gospel;
the present however, and the future Advantages
of being Religious, how easie is it to pass into a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107261:6"/>
Resolution of being so? While the Providence
of God seems to smile upon us in the Success of
Affairs, how forward are our purposes to be
Thankful? While men give us respect, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our Inclinations, how prone a thing is it to
be Courteous? While no body does us any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
or Affront, how gloriously can we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
our selves in Charity with all the world?
But in the mean time there may be nothing of
a grounded Religion in all this; It may be no
more than the Natural result of the present state
of our mind; which being at ease with the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of things without, is not willing to rifle its
own enjoyment by any disturbing Passions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
This therefore is not to be trusted to: But
he that will entertain any reasonable hopes of
his own Christianity must find it in the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of Temptation; what he can Forgive when
Injury provokes him; what he can Suffer when
Danger presents it self; what he can forego of
his own to promote the Interests of Piety: And
without these Experiences all our Professions,
tho' never so couragious, are but like <hi>Ephraim's</hi>
carrying about his Arms and his Bow as the
badges of his Valour, and yet running away in
the day of Battle.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The last Circumstance we are to reflect
upon, is, the Disciples Mistake of their Faith:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107261:6"/>
It was their own hearts they pronounc'd upon,
and yet they were deceived; and they cryed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unseasonably, <hi>now we believe,</hi> just at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
when they were ready to confute their
Pretence. Let us observe hence—That men are
naturally apt to harbour too indulgent an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of themselves. It must be acknowledged that
we are all too apt to do so; notwithstanding
that (as we may learn from the present In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance)
such an Opinion be extremely treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and the readiest way to prevent that good
in our selves, which we too fondly presume. A
good Conceit of our selves is a very comfortable
Passion; it sets us mightily at ease; and so it
has always a sure friend of our Nature: on the
other side, it breeds Carelesness, and prevents
Diligence, and hinders Proficiency, and so it has
always a sure friend of the Devil: and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then that it so universally steals upon us.
But besides these Two Causes, many men have
a Third, why a Redundance of their good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
should light upon themselves, and that is,
Because they spend so little of it upon others:
Their ill thoughts and their Censures spend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
all outwards; and so their good ones fall
of course to their own share. But alas! how
unreasonable as well as unjust a thing it is for
any to censure the Inwards of another, when we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107261:7"/>
see that even good Men are not able to dive
thro' the mystery of their own. Be assured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there can be but little honesty, without
thinking as well as possible of others; and there
can be no safety without thinking humbly and
distrustfully of our selves. Had the Disciples but
distrusted that Faith, which they so confidently
pronounc'd, they had infallibly secur'd it; had
they but cry'd (as once before) <hi>Lord increase our
Faith,</hi> instead of <hi>Now we believe;</hi> they had infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
prevented the shame of their approaching
fall. But as it is the first Method of God's good
pleasure to <hi>give Grace unto the Humble,</hi> so the
next act of his Compassion is to bring the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
to shame; That they may be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Humbleness as a Necessity, who
were not wise enough to prefer it as a Virtue.</p>
            <p>Which brings me upon the Consideration of
the Remainder of my Text, <q>Behold the hour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
yea is now come, that ye shall be scattered every
man to his own, and shall leave me alone.</q> In
which words we may observe, that, as the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
Crime was the <hi>leaving</hi> of their Master,
so the Occasion of that Crime was their <hi>Scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and the Reason of their Scattering was their
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the concern that each of them had for
their Own: <hi>Ye shall be scattered every man to his
Own, and shall leave me alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:107261:7"/>To form you a proper Instruction from this
Passage, I shall infer these Two Propositions from
it: 1. That when Christians divide, they leave
their Master: And, 2. That it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, our Own
things, and not the things of Christ that makes
us divide.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When Christians divide, they leave their
Master. Where you may perceive I use the
expression of the Text, in a sense that is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Analogical; For by leaving <hi>Christ,</hi> in the
Text, is meant the leaving his Person; but by
leaving <hi>Christ,</hi> in my Proposition, is meant the
leaving of his Interest: And so the plainest sense
of it will be this, That when Christians divide
and enter into separate Communions, they do a
thing that is injurious to <hi>Christ,</hi> and prejudicial
to his Religion.—This is a matter wherein the
present Posture of our affairs is highly concern'd;
and therefore give me leave, tho' you know it
already, to put you in remembrance of the
Truth of it.</p>
            <p>The Two great Ends of Religion and of
<hi>Christ's</hi> Communion with his Church, are the
Glory of God, and the Salvation of Men; and
it is very manifest, that the dividing into sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Communions is extreamly prejudicial to
each of these Ends.</p>
            <p>Let us see, (1) <hi>How it affects the Glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:107261:8"/>All the Christians in the World are in the
Scripture-stile call'd but one Assembly, (<hi>Ecclesia</hi>)
to intimate that tho' they are distant in places, yet
they ought to be but One, both in Affections
and Manner of Worship. God himself has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
it to be so, and that with respect to his
own Glory; For so he commands himself to be
honoured, so to be praised; as being never well-pleased
with the Worship of his People, but when
it proceeds from Unity of Spirit, demonstrated
by the Decency of a mutual resemblance. S. <hi>Paul
Rom.</hi> 15. 5. argues, that both agreement of hearts,
and agreement of Worship are expresly necessary
to the Glory of God; where he says, <q>Now the God
of patience and consolation grant you to be like-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one towards another, as it is in Christ Iesus, that
you may with one mind and one mouth glorifie God.</q>
Upon which passage <hi>Calvin</hi> makes this Reflection,
<q>
                  <hi>Non est ergo quòd jactet quispiam se Deo gloriam da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turum
suo more,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore (says he) Let no
Man boast within himself that he will glorifie
God after his own manner, for God hath such
regard to the Concent of his Service, that he will
not have his Glory set forth by the mouths of
those that separate and disagree.</q> Thus that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
—I allow that it adds to the Glory of a
Prince, when we can say, that tho' his Subjects be
divided into several Factions, and disagree among
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107261:8"/>
themselves, yet they agree in this to honour him.
This is true, because the Honour that is given to
men is not affected with the Piety, but only with
the sincerity of the Giver: but on the contrary,
the honour given to God takes all its value from
the pure Piety of the Giver; and therefore so
long as our Conscience lyes under the Taint of
such an irregularity as Division is, 'tis not all
the honour of our Lips, that can make amends
for the dishonour of our Hearts.</p>
            <p>No man doubts but that the Glory of God is
concern'd in the credit of his Religion; and yet
how highly is Religion discredited by the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of those that profess it? For since God has
given Religion designedly as a Cure for all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
amongst men, and to reduce them to a
concent of Minds and Hearts; if it shall happen
any where that Religion be observed not to
compass this end, who can hinder but that the
Religion it self shall fall under the blame of it?
witness those Calumnies and Reproaches that the
Reformed Religion is at this day loaded with
by its Adversaries; who for this very Reason;
because there are such Divisions among us, seem
to despise our Religion as false, as a Babel, as a
Beast with many heads and horns all pushing at
one another. Now, tho' this Argument does in
truth prove no farther than this—That the best
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107261:9"/>
Religion may be discredited by its Professors
(and I am sure the Devil is alway most busie
to bring it so about;) yet in the mean time, this
very scandal, That our Religion is false, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be wrested out of the mouths of those that
seek to blaspheme it, till such time as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of our Differences shall take away that
occasion that they have so unhappily given.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) If our Divisions have so ill an aspect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Glory of God, there is little hopes they
should look better toward the Salvation of men:
let us consider then in the next place with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to that.</p>
            <p>The Apostle tells us, <q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 15.</bibl> That Christ is
the Head, from whom the whole Body being fitly
joyned and compacted together, receiveth supplies in
every part, to the edifying of it self in Love.</q> And
a man need not make use of more words than
these, and that Idea that is in them, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
how necessary Charity is to Edification,
and Union to all the good Influences of God. I
know it is possible some may satisfie themselves
that they maintain Charity notwithstanding they
break Communion; but we find by sad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that this is next to impossible to be done:
For when mens differences are about matters of
Religion, Passion slides in under that fair pretext,
and lays claim to Conscience it self; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107261:9"/>
a piece of Zeal to be Uncharitable. Nay
we may further observe that when the matter
men differ about is very little, their Animosities
are generally the highest; and the smaller the
distance, the wider the breach: Insomuch that
most can live more friendly with an Infidel that
differs in the object of Worship, than with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Christian that differs only in the Form. The
reason whereof must be this, That when the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
of others are at a great distance from
our own, we look upon them as a simple Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion;
but when they come near to ours we
are apt to look upon them as a kind of Affront;
presuming—That where the distance is so little,
it is not so much the Matter of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
as the Malice of the Party that keeps up the
Difference. And this is a Prejudice that naturally
inflames men to revenge, and breeds a Canker in
Religion, that eats up the spirit of it.</p>
            <p>But (without all this) supposing a man that
breaks Communion, to maintain all other Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
as much as possible; supposing him to bear
malice to none, to censure none, to pray for, to
wish well to all; yet all this is short of the duty
of Brotherly Love, <hi>i. e.</hi> That Love which one
Christian owes to another: for Brotherly Love is
not to be exprest but by Communicating in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Offices, <hi>in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:107261:10"/>
(as the Primitive Fellowship of Christians is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
in the Holy Scripture) which offices have
therefore in all Ages been look'd upon as the
necessary Tests and Symbols of Christian Love.</p>
            <p>I need not insist on the multitude of other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
that Division is the Mother of: What a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
it is to wily Seducers, what a Rock to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
minds, what a Snare to Itching Ears, what
an opportunity to Men of either wanton, or pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
Fancies, to sow the Tares of Confusion; what
a provocation to God to suffer, that they who
cannot agree with one another, should be devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
one of another. What need I say more of
a thing that (we see) detracts from the Glory of
God, and the honour of his Religion, that bars
the influences of his Grace, and hinders Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that is an Immorality in it self, and a certain
temptation to many others; what need I say
more of it to make our Consciences condemn it?</p>
            <p>In the mean time, I do not say that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is to be held upon any Terms whatsoever: I
do not believe every Separation to be sinful, no
more than I believe every Union to be Sacred.
<hi>Christ</hi> may be left by those that hold together.
In that prospect that the Holy Scriptures give us
of the Kingdom of Antichrist, we do not learn
that it should be a divided Kingdom; but, on the
contrary, that it should be a mighty Confederacy,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107261:10"/>
and extensive Union to the setting up of an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
worship. In which case the Holy Spirit
cryes, <hi>Come out of her my people, that ye be not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of her sins.</hi> Whensoever therefore the Terms
of Communion come to be sinful, as they must
be where Faith is innovated, Inventions obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
Corruptions past into a Law, and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
charged with such obligations as are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
from the Rule of Christ, but bear a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
inconsistence with it; There it becomes a
Duty to Divide; and they are the Separatists
that force to Separate, not They who deplore
the necessity of so doing.</p>
            <p>'Tis our own Case to stand separated from the
Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but we call Heaven to witness
that it is not from any spirit of Division in us:
let but the Holy Scripture be the Rule, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Antiquity the Judge, and we are ready to
abide by the Award, and unite in the issue of such
a Determination. And as they that will agree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any other Terms, must resolve to sacrifice
Religion to a League, whereas on the other side,
They that will not agree upon such Terms as
these, seem resolved to sacrifice Christianity to
Faction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. So I pass to my Second Proposition, which
is this—That it is our Own Things, and not the
Things of Christ, which makes us divide.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:107261:11"/>It has always been, and always will be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
among Christians, so long as they divide,
that Religion engages them to do so: But Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
all the while mourns under, and remonstrates
against the slander. Religion implores men to be
both more Charitable towards one another, and
towards Her: For it is not only a sin to divide,
but it is a greater sin to entitle Religion to the
guilt of our Dividing. The Things of <hi>Christ</hi> and
of Religion are These, as the Apostle tells us, <q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Gal.</hi>
5. </bibl>Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness,
faith, meekness, temperance:</q> Did ever these Graces
engage men to divide? the Charge of Religion
is this, as the same Apostle, <q>If there be any Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfil ye my
joy, that ye be like-minded, having the same love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one accord and of one mind.</q> Did ever such a
Pathetical Adjuration as This engage men to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide?
If therefore the practice of men be found
to run opposite to these fundamental Graces, and
most Sacred Obligations of Christianity, 'tis no
rashness to conclude, That they are moved by
some other Springs than those of a well-weighed
Religion.</p>
            <p>Of those that separate from our Communion,
some pretend Conscience, as if our Communion
were unlawful; and some pretend Edification, as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107261:11"/>
if our Communion tho' it were lawful yet it edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
not. Let us now fairly examine these Two
Pretences, and see whether they are bottom'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Things of Christ or our Own.</p>
            <p>1. As to them that plead Conscience for their
separating from us, give me leave to premise, That
it is not sufficient for any man's Repose to say that
he is acted by his Conscience in what he does:
For we ought to consider, that since Conscience is
no other than our present Perswasion, our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
must needs lye at the mercy of every
thing that has power to perswade us; and hence
it oftentimes comes to pass that while Conscience
acts us, it self is acted by Passions and weaknesses,
and what then must become of the Regularity of
what we do? I know every man detests the Charge
of being sway'd in matters of Religion, either by
Interest or Peevishness, or Pride or Appetites or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions,
or any thing that is either avowedly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
or shamefully weak; and therefore I shall not
charge any man with being so swayed: But yet I
shall observe for the Caution of us all, that all
these things find a way to pass into our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and there to act as securely as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the Curtain; even at that time when we
should be ready to detest them in their own naked
appearance. And for the truth of this I shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to some undeniable experience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:107261:12"/>We have known some, who out of wantonness
of Wit, and affectation of singularity, have made
a perfect new Model of Christian Religion; have
made a God without Eternity, and a Saviour
without Satisfaction, and a Hell without Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
have first admir'd this their Scheme, and
then believ'd it; and so become Masters of a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Sect: And thus Vanity has past into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
We have known others of a moroser
Complexion, who falling as it were into dislike
with that sweetness that Christianity obliges to,
and those Sacraments that are the Ties of Union,
and that Gospel that so instantly presses it, have
come to believe that the very Gospel-Institutions
are but Type and shadow; That every Man has
a surer word of Prophecy within himself; And
that God must be serv'd without all Positive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances:
And these have sprang into a numerous
Sect: And thus Complexion has past into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
Others we know whose Covetousness has
first inclined them to teach, and then the success
of their Doctrine has inclined them to believe,
that the Merits of Humane Piety may be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
from Person to Person, and that the fruits of
Repentance may be purchased at a price: And
thus Avarice has past into Conscience. Others we
know, who having let their Minds grow gross
and carnal, and then finding themselves either too
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107261:12"/>
much aw'd, or too much at a loss in their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to a Pure and Invisible Being, have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
sensible Objects of Worship, and humane
Mediators, to whom they might address both
with more boldness, and more carelesness: And
thus Carnality has past into Conscience. Others
we know, who being of a temper more Zealous
and fierce, have perswaded themselves that all is
Sacred, that they do for the advancement of their
own Opinions; and so have allow'd and practis'd
Persecutions, Murders, Outrages; and thought
that in these they have done God good service:
And thus Cruelty has past into Conscience. We
have known others, who being uneasie in their
Worldly circumstances, and then reflecting on
that mysterious intimation that <hi>Christ</hi> should some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
reign alone upon the Earth, have believ'd (as
they were willing) that the time was now accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd;
and thereupon have cry'd down all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Government as Antichristian, and hop'd to set
up <hi>Christ</hi> and themselves together: And thus Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
has past into Conscience. We know o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who being bred up under Masters, better
skill'd in Affirming than Proving, have been taught
to believe, That the most commendable Faith is
that which swallows all things without examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the more Reason a man hears against
himself, the more meritorious is his obstinacy:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107261:13"/>
And thus Credulity has past into Conscience. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who being fond of some Opinions, which
they had no other foundation to build upon, have
made them Canonical by their Dreams: And thus
Fondness has past into Conscience. And have we
not heard of others, who have been as it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to an Aversion from their Youth? warn'd
to avoid a particular Communion at the peril of
their Souls? told that it was Antichristian, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish,
Socinian, Pelagian, and made to believe it
monstrous, without ever understanding it? And
thus Prejudice has past into Conscience. If then
both mens Appetites and Passions, Follies and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
Fondnesses and Aversions, Wishes and
Dreams may pass into their Consciences, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
and govern there, as we see by these unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
experiences they may; I need say no more
to prove that even when Men separate under that
venerable pretext of Conscience, they may yet se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
for those things which Christ will never
own to be his.—Let such therefore bring their
Conscience to its proper Light: For as it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for all to be guided by their Conscience,
so it is as necessary that Conscience it self be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Word of God. Now we readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that the Scripture does in some cases
authorize us to separate: <q>
                  <hi>Come out of her my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
says the Holy Spirit; <bibl>
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. </bibl>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <hi>Come out
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107261:13"/>
from among them and be ye separate,</hi> says the same
Spirit, <bibl> 2<hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17.</bibl>
               </q> But let it be consider'd that
in both those places the Cause alledged to justifie
the Separation, is an Idolatrous Worship and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
less: Let those that separate from us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
instance, where is that defiling Pitch, where
is that dangerous Contagion to be found in our
Church? How hath our Church faln from the
Faith, how hath she corrupted the Doctrines of
Christianity? Till they can do so, their Separation
cannot appear to have any Authority from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
and therefore it must be a Separation of
that kind which the Scripture every where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
for a sin.</p>
            <p>But here comes in the Second Plea, with a mien
of greater Sobriety; I mean the Plea of those
who cry—<q>Your Communion is Lawful, but it
edifies not, and therefore since we have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Separate Assemblies, Religious Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
obliges us to go there, where we can edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.</q>
—My Friends, however we suppose all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Laws for Unity of Worship are Dispensable
at Pleasure; yet I hope it will never be an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
among us, that the Laws of God requiring
the same Thing are so Dispensable. I have urged
our Union from the obligations of Scripture and
Inferences of Moral Reason, and I hope these
are things that would stand undissolved among
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107261:14"/>
us, tho' all human Laws were repealed—But let
us come to examine the Plea it self.</p>
            <p>Men cry they edifie not in our Communion:
but how comes this to be possible? Is it possible
that a People, particularly in this City, should not
be able to edifie under their establisht Clergy,
whose Pious Labours all the World both applaud
and profit by? Was there ever any Church in the
World that has furnisht the Piety of its Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
with so many excellent Treatises both of
Practical and Devotional and Controversial Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
as this hath done? and yet is it possible that
men should not be able to edifie under such a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
as this? I must confess it is possible, but the
reason of the possibility is Scandalous; For it is
Prejudice that hinders our Edification; Prejudice
that would hinder a man from improving under
the labours of an Angel. None deny but that our
Saviour was a most Edifying Preacher; and yet it
is as evident that a great many of those that heard
him were never the better for all that he said. They
were such who for their particular reasons spread
about ill Characters of him; and entertained a
mean opinion of him; and with this Prejudice
they hardned themselves against all the influence
of his Preaching. Prejudice is a thing whereby
Christ has always suffer'd; and doubtless he does
so now in a high measure among us.—Could but
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107261:14"/>
the wooings of God once prevail upon us to lay
this aside; could we but once come to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
prepar'd with Meekness and Patience
and Love; then every word would sound both
more Instructive to us and more moving: Then
besides all other possible improvements, we should
be sure to reap this (<hi>viz.</hi>) the mortifying of an
uncharitable Appetite, which at present is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
both of publick Scandal and Calamity; and
I am sure this would be a better measure of
Edification, then it is possible for us to arrive at
in any separate Assembly.</p>
            <p>But I am aware, that the greatest Prejudice is
still behind; 'tis that which lies against our Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Prayers. For it cannot pass the observation
of any man, nor the grieving of any good man,
to see how when a Congregation is met to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God, and are joyned in an Order of Prayers
so agreeable to his Worship, there shall be some
notwithstanding, who seem studiously concern'd
to shew a disrespect to the service: Which is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
so offensive, that tho' it may consist with
an unthinking zeal; yet 'tis impossible that it can
sit easie upon the Conscience of any man, that shall
once come to be reflexive as well as Religious.
Let us enter a little into the Merits of the Cause.</p>
            <p>What man can say, but that in the whole course
of our Prayers, the Conceptions are both awful
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107261:15"/>
and pious, and the expressions both proper and
affectionate? What man can say but that the
Praises there are suitable to the Majesty of God,
and the Confessions proper for the humiliation of
Sinners, and the Intercessions expressive of all the
duties of Charity, and the Supplications extended
to all the ordinary exigencies of Mankind? I
know no sober man can say to the contrary. But
then here lies the offence, they are common and
known beforehand, and prescrib'd, and always
the same; and this is nauseating; and this causes
that they do not edifie. I confess I cannot think of
any Argument to keep this Plea in countenance,
but one, and that is this, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That it is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
in the power of sudden and arbitrary Prayer
to beget attention more than that which we were
acquainted with before: But let me likewise ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that Piety has no share in the producing that
Attention: for attention to any thing that is New
to us, is the necessary product of simple Curiosity:
And this is the Reason that chains our Ears to an
<hi>extemporary</hi> Speaker; our Imaginations are held
busie in apprehending his Matter, in weighing his
Words, in estimating his Talent, and in watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after somewhat that may possibly be peculiar
and surprizing: Whereas when this is done, and
the Prayer ended, our very dislike of having the
same Form again, is a plain proof that our
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107261:15"/>
Curiosity affects us more than our Devotion: For
if the Form we have heard were in it self good
and properly expressive of all our concerns with
God, a sincere Piety would never nauseate the
eternal repetition of it. Methinks it were but just
that, when men come to worship God, they should
rather consider what pleases God, than what
pleases themselves: Now can any one say that
God is not pleased with a set Form of Prayer? How
comes it then to pass that whereas the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
makes mention twice of the Devotion used
by the Church Triumphant in Heaven, we are
taught in both places that it consists in a set Form,
(Consult <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. together with <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. and you shall
find it so.) Now I hope none dare charge those
Blessed Spirits (as they may when they please the
Ministers of our Church) that they use a set Form
either because of Poverty of Invention or Laziness
of affection: No, They use it in Testimony that
what is always good and proper, ought always to
please; and that it is only the untutor'd infirmities
of our own Imaginations that makes us hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Change. But beside this; we know well enough
that the power and energy of Prayer cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in any variety of words, but only in suiting our
affections to the words that we use: Now when
we know before-hand the words that are to be
used, or may have them before our eyes; our
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107261:16"/>
Soul is at perfect leisure to fuit and raise and
change her Affections, according to the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of every Word: Whereas while the Soul
is held in suspence about the meaning of a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
till such time as it be finished (as it must
necessarily happen in extemporary Prayer) she is
in a great measure depriv'd of this advantageous
leisure; and tho' the Imagination be still kept
busie, yet the affections can never follow, but by
starts and with disorder. And yet more than
this—Whereas it is apparent, that Curiosity does
beget attention in Prayer, as well as Piety, and
yet the latter only can be acceptable to God; a
Man cannot have the advantage, but only from
a set Form, to discern whether his attention be
truly pious or no; because he can then onely
judge how far Piety does move him, when it
moves him alone, and Curiosity is disingag'd.</p>
            <p>If therefore it be our Prejudice that hinders our
Edification, as it certainly appears it does in this
instance of Publick Prayer; which an humble
preparation of heart may make a better use of
to all the ends of Piety, than it possibly can of
any extemporary Form; I hope we cannot say
our Prejudice is a thing of Christ's; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is our Own things, that in this instance
likewise occasions us to divide.</p>
            <p>And now You our Brethren who have faln out
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107261:16"/>
with us by the way, Consider (I beseech you) how
we shall answer it at our Journeys end. Our
Quarrel is, that we will not <hi>walk by the same Rule;</hi>
and yet we are commanded to <hi>walk by the same
Rule.</hi> Our Defence is, that we imagine another
Rule to be better; but still what we contend for
is onely an Imagination, and what we contemn
is a Command: Nay, were we certain that the
Rule we propose is better; yet we are as certain,
that Love is better than that. How triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
has it sounded of late from one side of the
Nation to the other, That God is the only So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
of Conscience? Alas, that he were so!
But he is not: Were God once the Sovereign of
our Consciences in Deed, as we all acknowledge
he is in Right; Farewel Separation: Our Mind
and Way would then be but one; as our God is
but one, and he <hi>not the Author of Confusion, but
of Peace.</hi> Could we but once descend from our
high pretences of Religion, to the Humility that
onely makes men Religious; Could we but once
prefer Christianity it self before the several Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that bear its name, our Differences would
sink of themselves; and it would appear to us,
that there is more Religion in not contending,
than there is in the matters we contend about.</p>
            <p>And you our Brethren, the Pastors of those
that separate, (for I am willing to cast away a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107261:17"/>
few words in the air, tho' there be none here
concern'd to regard them.) I say you our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
the Pastors of those that separate! What
shall we do to conciliate or oblige you? Would
you have us come off from the establishment to
meet you? but that is not in our power: Do you
think That Establishment so extremely blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able?
But why will you always be Judges where
you are Parties? we desire not to be so: Let all
former Ages, and all the wise Men of the Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
World at this day be Judges betwixt us:
In the mean time, why do you not youchsafe us
your correspondence? Why do you not seek the
fruits of Peace in the methods of Peace? Come
and see whether we are those supercilious, those
untractable, those selfish Men: See whether you
should not be welcome to our Friendships, if
they were thought worthy: See whether you
should not be welcome to our Fortunes, if they
were thought needful. Cannot <hi>the Consolation
of Christ, and the Comfort of Love, and the Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Spirit, and bowels and mercies</hi> avail any
thing to cement us? Must our own particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
continue to divide us, though the things of
<hi>Christ</hi> conjure us to unite? Will you have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the Requests of our Church, though all
the Cords of Prudence, as well as Love, draw
you on to her Communion? If it must be thus;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107261:17"/>
In my poor Judgment, It is a most unreasonable
enmity, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> labours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
and I pray God it may be duly repented
of, before it be brought to a severer Barr.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally, My Brethren, You, whom the Grace
of God has setled in a just affection to our esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
Church; Reverence your Church above
all other Churches; but Christ himself above
every Church.</hi> Hold fast your Profession without
wavering; <hi>For</hi> yet a little while, and he that shall
come will come, and his Reward is with Him; Pray
for the peace of Ierusalem: Let your Moderation be
known unto all men: Be not overcome of evil, but
overcome evil with good. <hi>And</hi> the God who hath
loved us, and given us good hopes thro' his Grace,
comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good
Word and Work. <hi>To whom be Glory,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
