            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="2">2 The first whereof is clearing of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> from the Imputation, that the <hi>Greatest</hi> Traytors and Conspirators against her late Maiesty (and particularly <hi>Campian</hi> and <hi>Hart)</hi> gaue vp <hi>Fa. Rob. Bellarmine</hi> for one of their greatest <hi>Oracles,</hi> and this hee doth two waies. First, dubbing it for an <q>ABVSE exceeding a mans imagination, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger should thus write.</q> Secondly, <q>a deceiptfull Aequiuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that because they did cite him in Controuersies of Religion, therefore he should be accounted an Author of their Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 It is well that hee will giue <hi>Aequiuocation</hi> the right Epithete of <hi>Deceipt;</hi> but did his Maiesty say HEE was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged by them as the <hi>Oracle</hi> of their <hi>Conspiracies?</hi> No his words are, <hi>the greatest Traitors and Fomentors of CONSPIRATORS, gaue Bellarmine vp for one of their greatest Oracles in their Conference;</hi> (for thereto his Maiesty referres the Reader in the Margin) wherof their <hi>Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies</hi> was no part. For their <hi>Treasons</hi> they were arraigned <note place="margin">Apol. pa. 57.</note> conuicted, and adiudged; the <hi>Conference</hi> was had about their opinions in Religion; in which <hi>Colloquie,</hi> the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall <hi>Author</hi> they relyed vpon <hi>(Campian</hi> borrowed much

               <p n="4">4 Secondly, had HE bin concluded as the greatest <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle</hi> of those and other like <hi>Conspirators,</hi> there is no such <q>improbabilitie of truth, no waies to be defended,</q> as this <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer</hi> auoweth; but the argument is necessary: For the <hi>Cardinall</hi> being their principall <hi>Author</hi> for <hi>opinions,</hi> and the <hi>issue</hi> of those <hi>opinions</hi> being <hi>Treason</hi> and <hi>Conspiracie,</hi> it is more then <hi>probable,</hi> that from HIS positions and Lectures, they had <hi>suck't</hi> that <hi>poison</hi> which there ranckled at their hearts, and heere broke out (at their <hi>arriuall)</hi> in their actions. The <hi>Apologue</hi> is knowne and proper, that when the <hi>Trumpeter</hi> was taken in battell, and pleaded for his life, that HEE had <hi>killed</hi> no man, nor shed any blood, <note place="margin">Aesop.</note> 
                  <hi>Only</hi> sounded his instrument which gaue a pleasant noise; the answere was, that HE did more harme, and was the greatest <hi>slaughterman</hi> in the Army; because, were it not for his heartning and inciting sound, the horror of the crie and blood would appall his fellowes hearts; but when they were ready to quaile, HE then prouok't them to a fresh assault. And it was not for any valour that was in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or any hostile Acte in open armes done by them, that made <hi>Philip of Macedon</hi> to condition with the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>

               <p n="5">5 Which is the very Case of <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> He, in his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures &amp; Dictats, blowes the bellows of <hi>Seditious Doctrine</hi> which flames out by his schollers <hi>Conspiracies,</hi> to the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance</hi> of the chiefe States of Christendome.
