            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THREE thinges (gentle Reader) at the comming forth of this Booke may occur vnto thy mynd, in which thou mayst perhaps desire some satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. First the cause why so idle a worke as <hi>M. Barlowes</hi> Answere is knowne, and taken to be, should be answered at all by so graue and learned a man as <hi>F. Persons</hi> was. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly why this Answere is published so late after his death. And last of all what opinion is to be had of <hi>M.

Barlow</hi> is so desirous of honour, as like the Ape he thinketh his owne whelp fayrest: and himselfe will needs perswade his Maiesty that he hath so answered, as that no sound Reply can euer be made thereunto. Wherfore as well for thy instruction (good Reader) as also to rectify <hi>M.

            <p n="2">2. To the first point then, this briefly I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that <hi>F. Persons</hi> hauing seene the base manner &amp; method of writing which <hi>M.

               </note> esteemed the worke not worthy of any answere, and so resolued with himselfe to be silent therein, and in lieu of refuting this answere to set forth the other two parts of Resolution, so long before promised by him, and so much desired of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks in England: which whiles he went about to doe,
<pb facs="tcp:14527:6"/>
a Copy of this answere of <hi>M. Barlow</hi> came to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors hands, and was by them sent to the said Father with order to refute the same, perswading themselues that a booke of that bulke &amp; argument, written by a prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded Prelate, &amp; dedicated to his Maiesty, could not but beare some shew of learning, and therfore was, not to be left vnanswered. And that good opinion got <hi>M. Barlow</hi> by writing in English: for could these haue but vnderstood what was written, &amp; with what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and learning, he may be sure <hi>F. Persons</hi> should neuer haue bene troubled with the sight therof, but a shorter course had byn taken by casting it into the fire, the fittest element to purge such vnsauoury filth, as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where he belcheth forth in the same against all sortes of men, wherof you shall hardly fynd any one page to be void.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth in the very entrance of the first Chapter of his Supplement, which he intended to haue set forth with this Booke: but growing to so great a bulke by reason of the manifold aduantages giuen by the Aduersary, it was thought better in the end, that it should goe forth a part, as making of it selfe a iust volume with some little enlargement, or addition annexed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, in answere of some things obiected, forged not well vnderstood, or misalleadged by <hi>M.

Andrews,</hi> now of <hi>Ely,</hi> concerning the matters by him handled in the <hi>Supplement,</hi> whome togeather with <hi>M.

And what then will yow say to such forgery &amp; falsity? But for these two pointes I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre him to the Author of the Supplement, where they are more largely discussed. And were not <hi>M. Barlow</hi> of a seared conscience, and his cause desperate, he would neuer vse such legier-de-main, and discredit himself in this base manner. If his <hi>Spartans</hi> ready for the combat, can fight no better, it were more for his Maiestys honour, and their owne honesty, that they kept themselues out of the field, &amp; staid at home to tend gooslinges, then thus to betray their cause, and shame all. From Grammar let vs come to Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</p>
            <p n="12">12. It seemeth that in this science <hi>M. Barlow</hi> is very meanly seene,<note place="margin">M.

               <hi>M.

               <hi>What learning will iustifie that phrase of speach,</hi> An vnity of names &amp;c? <hi>And againe, that one name imparted to seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall persons, should be called an</hi> vnity, <hi>let all the Onoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks, and Nomenclators, or Mathematicians, or Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men be searched, and t'will not be found.</hi> So he. Doe you not thinke that this man hath searched far into the matter, read all bookes, and seene what all say, that so resolutly and generally pronounceth this sentence? &amp; yet <hi>Aristotle</hi> could tell him, that all <hi>aequiuoca, vniuoca, analoga,</hi> agree in one name: and none but one, as i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnorant as <hi>M. Barlow,</hi> will deny that the name <hi>Father</hi> agreeth to men and God, but in different manner; so that it is true to say, that the name of Father is all one in God and man, though in nature it differ. And what can be required more to the vnity of names? Or can <hi>M. Barlow</hi> conceaue that they haue one name without all vnity? Truly as well, as conceaue, that a man may be a foole, without foolery, or as simple as himselfe, vvithout simplicity.</p>

Or will they recall what they haue written of their discipline, that it is an essentiall marke of the Church, without which there were no Church, no Faith, no Ghospell, and consequently the Protestants to be no Ghospellers, to be out of the Church, out of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the faithfull?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This was one of my reasons, besides diuers other, that I alleaged in that place, all which for so much as it pleaseth Maister <hi>Barlow</hi> to deferre the answere thereof to another place afterwards, and now to satisfy a reason only of certaine contemptuous speach vsed against the Pope, and Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> I shall here also make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of my wordes therein. Thus then I wrote.
<q>In like manner wheras his Maiestie is knowne to be a Prince of most honorable respects in treaty,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>See Letter pag.</hi> 4.</note> and vsage of others, especially men of honour, &amp; dignity, it is to be thought, that he would neuer haue consented, if he had but seene the <hi>Booke</hi> with any attention, that those phrases of contempt not only against the <hi>Pope</hi> (at least as a temporall Prince) but neyther against the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> calling him by the name of <hi>Maister Bellarmine,</hi> should haue passed. For so much,<note place="margin">What his Maiesty in honour would haue mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked.</note> as both the <hi>Emperour</hi> and greatest Kings of Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dome, do name that dignity with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And it seemeth no lesse dissonant, to cal a Cardinal <hi>Maister,</hi> then if a man should call the chiefest dignities of our Crowne by that name, as <hi>M. Chancellour, M. Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, M. Duke, M. Earie, M. Archbishop, M. Bancroft,</hi> which I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure my selfe, his Maiestie would in law of Honour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, if any externe Subiect, or Prince should vse to men of that Sate in our countrey, though he were of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent religion. Wherfore, I rest most assured, that this proceeded, either out of the Ministers lacke of modesty, or charity: &amp; that if his Maiestie had had the perusall of the <hi>Booke,</hi> before it came forth, he would presently haue giuen a dash of his pen ouer it, with effectuall order to remedy such ouersights of inciuility.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So I then. And if I were deceiued in iudgement as now it seemeth I was, for that it plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the booke</note> yet in reason can it not be taken euill at my handes that followed those coniectures, and sought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deryue vpon others the pointes which in that booke I misliked, then to touch so great a personage as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14527:64"/>
was, and is my Prince. Yea in all duty and good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners I had obligation to conceale his Maiesties name, for so much as himselfe concealed the same: and when any Prince will not be knowne to be a doer in action, as in this it seemeth he would not at that tyme, I know not with what dutifull respect any subiect might publish the same, though he did suspect that he had part therin. For that subiects must seeme to know no more in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces affaires then themselues are willing to haue known. And consequently, when I saw that his Maiesty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed his name, I thought it rather duty to seeke reasons to confirme &amp; couer the same, then by presu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Princes secrets, and to reueale them.</p>
                  <p>And hauing thus rendred a reason of my doings in this behalfe, it remaineth that wee see what Maister <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> hath to say against it; for somewhat he must say, wheresoeuer he find it, &amp; though neuer so impertinent to the purpose, hauing taken vpon him to contradict, and plead against me in all pointes, and reaceaued his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ee before hand, as may appeare, by the possession he hath gotten of a rich benefice, and hopeth for more.</p>
                  <p>First then he runneth to a ridiculous imitation of my former reasons, whereby to seeke out whether <hi>Persons</hi> the Iesuite were the true author of my Lettter or no, &amp; from passage to passage doth furnish his style with some railing offals out of M. <hi>VVatsons Quodlibets</hi> against him, which though the author recalled, and sore repented at his death, as is publikely knowne and testified by them that stood by, and heard him: yet this charitable Prelate wil not suffer his synne to dye with him, but will needs rayse, and reuiue the same agayne after his death, and make it his owne, by this sinfull &amp; vnchristian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probration therof. But what maketh this to the purpose we haue in hand? surely nothing but to shew the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and misery of the slaunderer. For let Father <hi>Persons be a ranging voluntary runegate, and Hispanized Camelion,</hi> as here he is termed, or any thing els which an intemperate, loose, or lewde tongue can deuise for his con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>umely,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14527:64"/>
what is all this to the matter in hand, that is to say, to the writing of the former letter, or who was the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thereof? Doth not here malyce, and folly striue which of them shall haue the vpper hand in M. <hi>Barlow?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet one point he hath more of singularity in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which I suppose will goe neere to make the reader laugh, if he be not in choler with him before for his malice. For wheras I had professed my selfe to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded vpon the reasons set downe, that his Maiestie was not the penner of the <hi>Apologie,</hi> though it was printed by <hi>Barker</hi> his Printer, and set forth <hi>authoritate Regia,</hi> by the Kings authority, alleadging for example, that first of the minister T. M. knowne afterwardes to be <hi>Thomas Morton,</hi> who published some yeares gone, his lying and slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous <hi>Discouery</hi> against Catholikes, and gaue it this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, <hi>that it was set forth by direction from Superiours</hi> (though perhaps no Superiour euer read it) and the like I sayd, might be suspected that this other Apologie fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with <hi>authoritate Regia,</hi> might perhaps proue to be the worke of some other T. M. to wit, <hi>Thomas Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,</hi> somewhat neere to his Maiestie, by reason of his Ministeriall office, which then he held: all which declaration notwithstanding Maister <hi>Barlow</hi> is so set to haue men thinke, that I knew and perswaded my selfe, that it was the Kings booke indeed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Barlowe pag.</hi> 5.</note> and that by those two letters T. M. I meant <hi>Tua,</hi> or <hi>Tanta Maiestas. By those ciphers</hi> (saith he) <hi>of T. M. if he will speake without equiuocation he meant Tua, or Tanta Maiestas.</hi>

I doe describe the person, and office neere the king, as being then Deane of his Chapell though I name it not. I doe shew probabilities, how he might presume to write, and set forth that booke <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate Regia,</hi> by shewing it only to the king. And how could I then by those two letters of T. <hi>M.</hi> meane <hi>Tua,</hi> or <hi>Tanta Maiestas?</hi> or what sense of grammer, or coherence

                     <p>But why (I pray you) is this wofull attempt of those vnfortunate ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlemen, so often brought in againe,<note place="margin">The odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; oft repetition of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> and repeated almost in euery corner of this booke?

The Minister himselfe confesseth in his very next lynes, the equity of his Maiesty to be such, as he professed in his Proclamation, &amp; Parlament-speach, that he would not vse other Catholikes the worse for that.

As for example, if <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> agree not in being men (which is the <hi>species</hi>) they can neuer agree in the indiuidual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of being particuler, and singuler men, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywise they may haue perfect agreement and likenes in the first, to wit ion being men, albeit they do differ, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree in the later, as hauing different indiuiduall, &amp; perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall proprieties, whereby they are distinguished, &amp; made seuerall men.

to be esteemed as to be thurst vpon Catholickes, with an</hi> (only:) wheras I haue no such manner of speach, as the Reader may see in my owne wordes set downe at large in the XII. number of the first Paragraph. And therfore this perpetuall custome of falsifying in euery place lightly where he pretendeth to cite my wordes, would weary a man to deale with him. But that I haue resolued to haue patience with him yet somewhat further.</p>
                  <p>My speach then about this word <hi>Only,</hi> was as you haue heard, that wheras, the Apologer had sayd that his Maiesties will was, that none of the Catholike profession should be the worse vsed for the powder-plot, he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adioyned, <hi>That</hi> Only <hi>at the next sitting of Parlament a forme of an Oath was framed to be taken by all &amp;c.</hi> By which word <hi>Only,</hi> I sayd, that the Apologer seemed to make small ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of taking, or not taking this Oath; for so much as he supposed the Catholicke people to haue no agrieuance, or pressure therby, for that otherwise, it had not bene true, that they should not fare the worse for the sayd powder-treason.</p>
                  <p>And what will <hi>M. Barlow</hi> say to this?

as Catholike doctrine in all Schools of the world, as well of <hi>Spaine, France, Italy,</hi> and others, do teach, and define, that all Catholike people, whether they be farre, or neere, without exception, are equally subiect to the supreme Pastour of the Church, wherof they are members: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, I say, that dwell they neuer so farre of, they cannot be called, nor accounted <hi>Messis aliena</hi> to their said vniuersall Pastour.</p>

on earth, that may be lost in an instant, and long cannot indure, why should God thinke it so inconuenient to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his Church by daring of Princes, least perhaps they should wax angry, and dare him againe?

                  <hi>Si non audierint, transibunt per gladium</hi>; If they obey not, they shall passe by the sword.

               <p>Now then to come to my former proposition, that the Prouidence of God might seeme to be defectuous, if his diuine Maiestie had left no remedy for so great an euill: it is founded vpon all those places of Scripture, where it is sayd that Gods workes are perfect, as <hi>Deuter.</hi> 32. and that they are made in wisedome, <hi>Psalme</hi> 103. vers. 24. that is to say, in most high wisedome, <hi>&amp; ordinata sunt,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. they are according to order &amp; well ordered, &amp; the like. Out of all which is inferred, that whatsoeuer the perfection of wisdom, &amp; good order doth or can prescribe in any worke, that is to be presumed to be in Gods works, yea with far higher perfection then mans wisedome can reach vnto. Whereby it followeth, that as when a prudent humane Law giuer instituteth a Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-wealth, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth for all inconueniences, that by humane probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity may fall out vnto the same: so much more Christ our Sauiour, being not only man, but also God, must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to haue prouided sufficiently and aboundantly for his Kingdome, and Common-wealth which is the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, purchased with his owne bloud, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of all hurtes and euills imminent to the same;

Neyther is this any way blasphemous or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull to our Sauiours infinite wisdome and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as M. <hi>Barlow</hi> would most impertinently seeme to vrge, but highly rather to his honour: for somuch, as wee professe that he hath prouided for this euill, and the Protestants hold that he hath not.</p>
               <p>For as, when a man beholdeth a house made by some excellent Architect, and considereth all the partes &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities thereof, with prouision for all vses, and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for all cases that may fall out, he admireth the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence &amp; dependance of one thing vpon another, prayseth and extolleth the wisedome and foresight of the Author, saying: If this or that had not bene foreseene, and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, as excellently it was, it had byn a great want and defect, but being prouided for, it doth infinitly comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his sayd care, wisedome, foresight, and prouidence. And euen soe in our case, when a man considereth the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble excellency of Christ our Sauiours wisedome, in other pointes concerning the gouerment of his Church, how carefully and orderly he hath prouided for the same, in all necessary points, as in part the holy Apostle doth describe both to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and <hi>Ephesians,</hi> appointing some Apostles, some Prophetes, some Euangelists, some Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, some Pastours, <hi>ad consummationem Sanctorum, in op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14527:116"/>
these things, I say, being well considered, do inferre that it cannot possibly stand with such high wisedome &amp; prouidence of our Sauiour, to leaue his sayd body and Church vnprouided of sufficient authority, to preuent, or remedie so mayne a calamitie, as might fall vpon the sayd Church by temporall Christian Princes, if there were no restraint or punishment for them.</p>
               <p>Nor do the Protestants themselues pretermit to vse such kind of arguments, and consequences for their owne defence, when they deale with domesticall Aduersaries, to wit, with Protestants of other Sects. As for example, when the <hi>Puritan</hi> refuseth all Bishops, Archbishops, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther distinction of subordination in the Clergy: what vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in effect the Protestant on the other side, but that it belonged to Christ his diuine prouidence to leaue such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction and subordination: and consequently that it might be noted for defectuous, if he had left but the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan parity in all?</p>
               <p>The like passeth with the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> who denying the temporall Prince to be Head of the Church, and confesseth consequently that their Church is headlesse vpon earth, but only dependeth on <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as head in heauen; is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by the English Caluinists with the same argument of the defect of Gods prouidence, if he had not prouided some Head on earth also. And much more holdeth this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> who hold that Christ hath left no temporall power or Magistrate in his Church, to iudge or condemne, and especially to death, for any cause whatsoeuer, for that he sayth, <hi>nolite i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that here is a scandall actiue without a passiue, and scandall giuen, but not taken.</p>
                  <p>And the like example may be giuen of facts. As if a man should see <hi>M.

For of twenty that are imprisoned there, not one lightly is touched with torture: and when any is in the case, by law appointed, it is knowne to be more mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then commonly in any other tribunall. But let vs leaue this as of least moment, and depending only vpon his asseueration, and my denyall, and let vs passe to that which is of more importance, for iustifying the cause it selfe, to wit, by what right of power and authority, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church proceedeth against heretickes, and how different it is from that wherby Protestants pretend to be able iustly to proceed against vs for matters of Religion.</p>
               <p>First of all he sayth, that I do take as granted, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Catholike Church, <hi>which we deny</hi> sayth he, <hi>and the chiefest learned of their side could as yet neuer conuict our denialls.</hi> Wherto I answere that if themselues may be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that are most interessed in the controuersie, I do not meruaile, though they neuer yield themselues for conui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.

                  <hi>Barlow</hi> demaundeth of me, in what sense I take the word <hi>Catholike,</hi> when I suppose the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be the Catholicke Church? <q>For if I take it (sayth he) for <hi>Vniuersall,</hi> then <hi>Rome</hi> being but a particuler Citty, and the true iurisdiction therof, confined within a limited Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, or Prouince, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church cannot be the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke or Vniuersall Church,<note place="margin">M. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Church of Rome.</note> for that it is but a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prouince. But if (sayth he) I take Catholike, for the profession of the true fayth, as S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth, calling that Church of <hi>Africa,</hi> the Catholike Church, then can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not the Romish Church neyther in this sense be the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik Church: for that which the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> said of the Iewes Church, <hi>Her gould is mixed with drosse, and she whose fayth was plighted in Christ, is become an Adultresse,</hi> may be sayd also of the Roman Church of this day, and so cannot be the Catholike Church &amp;c.</q>
Which are two such mighty arguments, as well declare the poore mans misery in the defence of his cause.</p>
               <p>For to the first I would aske M. <hi>Barlow</hi> whether one man may not haue two Iurisdictions, or rather one Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction extended differently to two things, one more particuler, the other more generall. As for example, the Mayor of <hi>London</hi> hath his particuler gouerment first and immediatly ouer his owne howse, family, and peculiar lands, and yet besides that, he hath iurisdiction also ouer all the Citty. And to make the case more cleare, let vs sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14527:133"/>
that he hath both the one &amp; the other from the king<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> shall it be a good argument to say, that he is Gouernor of his owne particuler landes, house, and family, which is knowne to be confined and limited to such a part of the Citty, therfore he vsurpeth by stiling himself lord Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the whole Citty? And the like demaund may be made of the Kings authority first and imediatly ouer his Crowne lands, which is peculiar vnto him, and limited with confines, but yet it impeacheth not his generall authority ouer the whole Realme:<note place="margin">The Pope both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet chiefe Pastour of the whole Church.</note> Euen so the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath two relations or references, the one as a seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Bishop, ouer that people, and so had S. <hi>Peter</hi> who was Bishop of the same place, euen as S. <hi>Iames</hi> had of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and the like: and besids this, he hath an vniuersall Superintendency and iurisdiction giuen him ouer all, as Head of the rest. So as Catholikes doe not deny but that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it maketh a particuler Prouince or Diocesse, is a member only of the Catholicke Church, not the whole, though a principall &amp; chiefe member, by the reason of the emine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour, &amp; that the sayd Pastour therof is but a member also of the Catholik Church, but yet the chiefest me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto all the rest are subordinate, that is to say the head &amp; guid therof. So as this is poore argument as you see.</p>
               <p>But the second is more pittifull, if you consider it well: <hi>for if we take Catholike,</hi> sayth he, <hi>for the profession of the true faith, as S.</hi> Cyprian <hi>did, when he called the Church of</hi> Africa <hi>the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church; then cannot the Romish Church be the Catholike Church.</hi> And why? <hi>for that her gould is mixed with drosse,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> sayd of the Iewish Church in his tyme.<note place="margin">M. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes bad argument which is false both in antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</note> But here are two propositions, an antecedent, and consequent and both of them false. The antecedent is, that as the Church of the Iewes, in the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> his dayes, being in her corrupt state, was not the true teaching Church, in respect of the naughty life vsed therein: so neyther the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in our dayes being full of the same sinnes &amp; bad life, can be the true Catholicke Church: this ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, I say, is most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:14527:139"/>
he was Protectour of <hi>Scotland,</hi> wrote to the Catholickes to further their Obedience towards him. He neuer medled in any thing, vntill this Oath so preiudiciall vnto his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and vnto the Consciences of Catholikes was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and vrged.</p>
               <p>And as for the peace here named, more continuall &amp; happy then that of <hi>Salomon</hi> or <hi>Augustus,</hi> which <hi>M. Barlow</hi> sayth might be enioyed by his Maiestie, with his Subiects, if the Pope were not: it is well, that he will so much as name peace, who seemeth in all his speaches, to sow the seeds of warres, hatred, and contention. But if his mind were to peace indeed, he cannot be so simple, but to see, that the rigorous and afflictiue courses vsed, and this, as all men take it, by the instigation of those of his coate and order, cannot be meanes to peace of mindes, howsoeuer otherwise they liue in externall quietnes and deuoyd of tumults. And this is all, that for the present I haue to write in this matter.</p>

               <p>OVR purpose then, being as now we haue declared, to touch some principal points only, handled by <hi>M.

very plausible in his opinion, and capable not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his rayling eloquence, and odious amplifications, but of all grosse and abiect flattery in like manner; togeather with some hopes of other gaines also that way, wherunto it seemeth that the poore man hath his tongue and pen most ready to the sale at all turnes and occasions offered. But it may be before we end this conference, his market may be more then halfe marred in the iudgment, at least of disappassionate men, &amp; especially with his most Excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Maiesty, whome aboue all other he seeketh to gull in this matter, turning all vpon him, which I both spake and meant to a Minister of <hi>M. Barlowes</hi> owne ranke: &amp; so I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime from the calumnious imputation, that it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth any way his Highnesse, and shall answere all in the same sense which I then wrote, and meant the same; reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all dutyfull and respectiue reference to his Maiesties Person and Iudgment, as bounden duty obligeth me.</p>
               <p>First then occasion being offered, or rather necessity imposed to speake of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi>: for that albeit the Pope had not so much as named her in any of his two Breues, yet had the Apologer brought in her mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with many high praises, for disgrasing of Catholickes, and their cause, and for scorne to the Pope, as though he had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause pittyed and mourned their afflictions vnder her, which he saith was none at all, for that to his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge she neuer punished any Papist for Religion. For these causes, I say, I was forced in my Letter, to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to this assertiue proposition, wherunto the tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, afflictions, calamities, spoiles, exiles, and bloud of so many shed by her, did manifestly in the eyes and eares of al men and women that haue liued in our dayes, contradict and reclaime. And yet did I resolue to do the same as mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sparingly as I might, answering only the wordes of the Apologie, and abstayning purposely from al bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of speach, so far as the iust defence of the cause per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and so shall continue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>ty also to his Maiestie present</hi> &amp;c. Vpon which wordes I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the phrase of sacrificing to the Queenes <hi>Manes,</hi> or <hi>Ghostes,</hi> seemed to me very profane, as proper to the Pagan Sacrifices, vsed to those infernall spirits which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods, &amp; hurtful Gods, &amp; therfore endeauored to please them with sacrifices.

               <p>
                  <q>But as for his heathen profane sacrificing to the <hi>Manes</hi> or Hob-goblins of his late Lady,
I confesse it is an office fitter for a Protestant-Minister,<note place="margin">

For if all the old platforme of Saints liues, prescribed in Scriptures, and practised by the seruants of God, were not erroneous and vaine, as much fasting, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual prayer, daily mortification, frequent recollection, diligent chastisement of theyr bodies, humble &amp; feruent deuotion, labouring and working theyr saluation in feare and trembling, aboundant almes-deedes, haire-cloth and ashes, contrition, sorrow and sobbing for their sinnes: yf these things (I say) were the ancient wayes to life, and euerlasting saluation: then must the pathes of Queene <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth,</hi> which are knowne by most men, to haue bene eyther wholy different, or most opposite to these, led to another opposite end, <hi>quia vnusquisque recipiet secundum opera s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But I would aske <hi>M. Barlow,</hi> how he commeth to know this secret? did he euer heare her Confession? For if he did, he might with far better conscience vtter her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues knowne thereby, to her prayse, and to the edification

of others, then he did the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> his vices, to his infamy, and other mens scandall. But I for my part doe thinke, that albeit Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> went often to confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, yet from that time to her death, which was more then forty yeares, she neuer tooke the benefit of that Sacrament;<note place="margin">Q.

And albeit shee had had, both grace, wil, and time to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse her sins, yet do I belieue that she would neuer haue chosen <hi>M. Barlow</hi> for her Confessour, and Ghostly Father; and consequently all that he talketh here of <hi>her vices criminall, and not continued,</hi> and <hi>of hellish crimes neuer committed,</hi> is spoken without booke, vpon no greater ground, then that he listeth to say and write so of her. And this shall serue for the first point, concerning his excessiue prayses of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> though we shall haue occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to handle somewhat therof againe in the fourth point a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her mortifications.</p>
               <p>Touching the second point then of impotent and exorbitant railing; albeit much were to be sayd; yet doe I not meane to loose time in the repeating thereof, or iniurie the eares of graue and modest men with hearing such contemptible matter: it is reuenge inough for me to vnderstand by diuers wayes, as I doe, that his owne friends doe condemne him, and thinke contemptuously of him, for entring into such an odious kind of writing. And for other that are different from him in religion, though they thinke him not worthy of any Answere, that taketh such a course; yet haue I thought good for this once to bestow so much paynes as to runne his Booke ouer, and to returne him answere to other points, though not to this, but yet so, as by those other points which I handle, the mans spirit may be so well knowne, as none will meruayle that he tooke so dishonest and impudent a course of virule<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t rayling.</p>

And if to be a <hi>Bishop</hi> also be a mortification, then hath <hi>M.

                  <p>The Catholike doctrine is, that mortification is a most excellent Christian vertue, commended highly in the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and exercised by all Saints, and especially by our Sauiour <hi>Christ,</hi> and his Apostles, and by the greatest Saints, &amp; Seruants of his, that haue ensued in his Church, as may appeare as well by those words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, as also these other to the <hi>Romans</hi>:<note place="margin">

               <p>From <hi>Poetry</hi> then he passeth to <hi>Philosophy,</hi> saying, that if I had read <hi>Epictetus</hi> in his <hi>Euchiridion,</hi> and those that doe comment vpon him, I should find it a <hi>Philosophicall</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that those two contraries, (<hi>copia</hi> and <hi>inopia</hi>) doe make the greatest misery, when a man possesseth much &amp; yet desireth more.</p>

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:14527:163"/>
to wit of the one hundred and thirty that before I mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Secondly for that the publike Registers themselues and Histories, as <hi>Iohn St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly for that they themselues dying did protest v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their consciences, as they should be saued, they neuer meant treason in thought, word, or deed against Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
                  </p>

                     </gap>ourthly for confirmation of this, I alleaged this other reason, so much scorned by M. <hi>Barlow,</hi> they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing life offered them if they would renounce the Pope, &amp; conforme themselues to the State, they refused the same: which he saith is a false and faulty inference, and I say it is very good and true, and that if <hi>M.

                        </gap>e,</hi> euery action is specified, that is to say, taketh his nature and essence from his obiect and end. As if a man should kill one to gayne his goods, this act hath both the nature of man-slaughter &amp; theft, the first from the obiect, the second from the end or intention of the doer: which Philosophicall principle being applyed to our case doth euidently proue that the choice of death in him that hath life offered, vpon conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he will doe some act against his faith, as going to the <hi>Protestants</hi> Church is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed by <hi>Catholickes,</hi> though otherwise he were n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that the like thing was reported to be vsed to other, for witch-craft.

               <p>But yet let vs see briefly what reasons he frameth for this his consequence.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Ergo,</hi> it is height of pryde in the Catholicks to sue for it: which second or <hi>minor</hi> proposition, for that he imagined we would deny, that <hi>it would be a staine to his Maiesties <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<hi rend="margQuotes">by diuers weake, and fond reasons, not vnfit for his inuention, as, that his Maiestie should be contrary to himselfe, and shew too much weaknes and slipperines, hauing apprehended the religion, which he now professeth, from the cradle of his infancy, resolued in his conscience, mantayned it by disputation, enacted it by lawes, established it by Oath, &amp; the like:</hi>
which are reasons quite from the matter.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">I leaue his other reasons as triuiall, and not worth the answering, as that Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> would not graunt this toleration of conscience, that our doctrinall positions are dangerous, that if his Maiesty should graunt toleration, he should loose the loue of all his Subiects, &amp; the like: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of some are false in the antecedent,</hi>

The first wherof, which is a true Ministry, they (<hi>Protestants</hi>) shall neuer haue, till Bishops and Archbishops be put downe, and all Ministers be made equall. The other also will neuer be brought to passe, vntill Kings and Queenes doe subiect themselues vnto the Church, and doe submit their Scepters, and throw downe their Crownes before the Church, and licke vp the dust of the feete of the Church, and willingly abyde the Censures of the Church &amp;c.</q>

               <p>And this much may be sufficient for discussing of this point, Whether subiects may or must obey their Princes, when they command things against their consciences, which in my Letter I denyed.

                  </gap>ould them that Gods will was contrary: and as for their asking, and obtayning leaue before they went to sacrifice in the Desert, who doth not see, but that it was in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of temporall danger, which might ensue vnto them, if so great a number of their vnarmed people should haue aduentured to depart without his licence. But I would demaund of <hi>M. Barlow,</hi> who sayth, <hi>that the people of Israel shewed their obedience to be due vnto Pharao, and performed it in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of spirituall seruice,</hi> what manner of obedience was that, which came alwaies in the Imperatiue mood, <hi>Thus saith our Lord,</hi> Dimitte populum meum, <hi>Let go my people?</hi> And when he yeelded not therunto, he was plagued and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with so many afflictions, as are set downe in <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> for 9. or 10. Chapters togeather: &amp; in the end what leaue obtayned they, but against his will, when he durst no longer deny them? Which appeareth, for that his feare being somewhat mitigated, he pursued them afterward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And will <hi>M.

Or of spirituall iurisdiction in heathen Princes, ouer faithfull people in causes Ecclesiasticall, that was contradicted both in word and fact by <hi>Moyses</hi> himselfe? But let vs heare his second instance, for it is more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So,</hi> saith he, <hi>the commaundement of King</hi> Cyrus <hi>was in a cause

meerly Ecclesiasticall</hi> viz. <hi>the building of the Lords house in</hi> Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>and transporting thither the consecrated vessels.</hi> But who doth not see that these things as they were ordayned by King <hi>Cyrus</hi> were meere temporall, as is the building of a materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Church,<note place="margin">A simple Discourse</note> for that otherwise, the Masons, Carpenters &amp; Architects, that build the same, should be Ecclesiastical officers, albeit they were Gentiles. If King <hi>Cyrus</hi> had had authority to appoint them out their sacrifices, &amp; to dispose lawfully of their sacred actions therein, as he had not, nor could haue, being a Pagan, and not of their faith &amp; religion; then might they haue sayd, that he had beene a spirituall Superiour vnto them: but for giuing them leaue only to go to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to build their Temple, and to carry their consecrated vessels with them, that had been viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken away from thence, argueth no more spirituall iurisdiction in him, then if a man hauing taken away a Church-dore key, so as the people could not go in to pray, except he opened the dore, should be said to haue spirituall iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer that people for opening the dore, &amp; letting them in, &amp; that they in praying him to open the said dore, did acknowledg spiritual obedience vnto him. And is not this meere childish trifllng, &amp; worthy the wit of <hi>M. Barlow.</hi>

               <p>What definition trow you, will <hi>M.

                     </gap> that himselfe had bene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to be slayne for burying men before, the Story doth not only defend him, but also commendeth him for the same; saying:<note place="margin">

                  <p>

                        </gap> as the soundest and worthyest to be receaued.</hi> This is his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; whereby it is euident, that he permitteth only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King to execute that which his Church in <hi>England,</hi> to wit, the Bishops and Clergy therof, shall determine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout matters of religion, which is no one iote more of power in Ecclesiasticall matters, then that which Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks do ascribe vnto their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>emporall Princes, to execute what the Church determineth: but yet with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of much more dignity, that they are bound to the execu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion only of that which the Vniuersall Church shall determine, &amp; not of their owne subiects alone, as it falleth out on the behalfe of his Maiesty of <hi>England</hi> in this case. In
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:14527:211"/>
which point also I do not see, how he can wind himselfe out of this maze, that must necessarily follow of his owne doctrine, to wit, that one should receiue from another, that the other receiued from him. As for example, if the Bishops being his Maiesties subiects, as well in spirituall as temporal affaires, haue no spirituall iurisdiction but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, as the Statute of King <hi>Edward</hi> doth determine: and on the other side his Maiesty to haue no authority, to define of any matter belonging to religion at all, but only to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute that which the Bishops do define; it seemeth that they receiue from his Maiesty that authority, which they deny to be in him, and so, that he giueth them the thing, which he hath not in himselfe, but is to receaue from them.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer it is euident by this doctrine of theirs, that the Bishops do make their Courtes &amp; Tribunalls for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, to be absolutly greater then the Kings, for that they do allow him no other power for Iudging in spirituall matters, but only to execute, that which they shall define and determine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="margQuotes">And albeit for dazeling the simple readers eyes, <hi>M. Barlow</hi> doth in this place fumble vp a certaine distinction,<note place="margin">M.

Yet doth all this reach no further, but to the power of execution of that which others haue determined, which may be called a power of impotency in that behalfe; for that therin he is subiect, and not Superiour, especially if it lye not in his power, either to execute, or not to execute, as he shall think best, which <hi>M. Barlow</hi> here denveth, saying: <hi>That he may, and ought to execute, when the Church hath determined.</hi> But on the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:14527:211"/>
other side, if he haue power and liberty to execute, or not to execute, then is the other power of defining in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to small purpose. For that they may define, and he not execute, his iudgment being that they haue defined e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ill, and by that way becommeth he their Iudge againe, to define whether they haue defined well, or no. And this is another circle or labyrinth which I see not how <hi>M. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </hi> will easily auoid.</p>
                  <p>I doe pretermit diuers other childish thinges that be in this speach of his, as where he propoundeth thus the question: as first, <hi>VVhether a Prince may iudge in cases of Religion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>d saith?</hi> as though these two were <hi>Sinonyma,</hi> and all one; Whereas religion contayneth many cases, as well of life, manners, and cerimonyes, as of faith; in all which cases it may be demanded, how far the King may be iudge. Secondly he saith, that the King cannot define, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, what is sound Diuinity or not, which is far from the purpose. For the question is not, whether the King may iudge and determine what is sound Diuinity or Theologie, but what is matter of faith, and what is to be belieued, or not be belieued by a true Christian within his realme. Thirdly in like manner when he saith, that the King hath only <hi>iudicium executiuum,</hi> or <hi>iurisdictionis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">M.

                  <p>Fourthly his terme also of <hi>discretiuum</hi> ascribed by him vnto all Christians, to haue power to try spirits, whether they be of God or no (besides that it seemeth contrary to that of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vp discretion of spirits to be a peculiar and seuerall gift vnto some alone, saying, <hi>Alij discretio spirituum</hi> &amp;c.) is nothing well applyed by him to <hi>iudicium execu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

subiects to iudge of theirs: for that other wise there must needes ensue an inextricable confusion of trying, &amp; iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one the others spirits. As if for example the Bishops o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>England</hi> should try &amp; condemne the spirits of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytans, and they agayne the spirits of the Bishops, by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of this power to discerne spirits, giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by <hi>M.

                     </hi> out of the words of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> there would neuer be an end.</p>
                  <p>And lastly it appeareth by all this that his l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>st distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, wherin he sayth, <hi>that the King may iudge for the truth, and not of the truth,</hi> is a meere delusion,<note place="margin">M.

               <p>This was then my speach, yielding furthermore a reason, why I did not stand vpon the places of some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler Councels alleadged, for that the discussion of this one made manifest all the rest, that they tended only to this end, that they proued temporal obedience in subiects towards their Princes, in temporal affaires, which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks deny not, and so in effect they proue nothing to the purpose in hand. But yet it shall be good to ponder a little, what <hi>M. Barlow</hi> bringeth in against that, which heere I haue written. First he saith, that not only these Prouinciall Councels, of <hi>Arles</hi> in France, and diuers others submitted themselues wholy to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, in most humble termes, but the foure Generall Councels also s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of great solidity. And yet I suppose that he could not be so forgetfull, or negligent as not to see, that all this is quite contrary to that which he wrote within three leaues<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But now if not only the Councell of <hi>Arles,</hi> and other Prouincial Councels, but the first foure General Councels submitted themselues also for the validity and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Decrees, which are knowne to haue bene concerning points of religion and faith, vnto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Royal assent: so as whatsoeuer was decreed there by the Church (&amp; this not a Prouincial or National Church only of England, but the whole Vniuersall Church ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in those first foure Counc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Obedience is against faith &amp; saluation of soules: nor doth the <hi>Breue</hi> forbid it:<note place="margin">Neither the Pope or Church can make new Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith.</note> nor doth any learned Catholike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the Pope hath power <hi>to make new Articles of Faith</hi>: nay rather it is the full consent of all Catholike Deuines, that the Pope, and all the Church togeather, cannot make any new Article of beliefe, that was not truth before, though they may explane what poynts are to be held for matters of faith, and what not, vpon any new heresies or doubts arising; which articles so declared, though they be more particulerly, and perspicuously knowne now for points of faith, and so to be belieued, after the declaration of the Church, then before: yet had they before the selfe same truth in themselues, that now they haue. Nor hath the said Church added any thing to them, but this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only. As for example, when <hi>Salomon</hi> declared the true Mother of the child that was in doubt, he made her not the true Mother therby, nor added any thing to the truth of her being the Mother: but only the declaration.

               </p>
               <p>So in my former writing: now we shall examine what M. <hi>Barlow</hi> replyeth about these two points. In the first, whether the Oath do containe only temporall Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, he is very briefe; for hauing repeated my words by abbreuiation, that the Popes <hi>Breue</hi> forbids not tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Obedience.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Barlow pag.</hi> 181.</note> 
                  <hi>No,</hi> saith he, <hi>it forbids the Oath, wherin is only acknowledgment of ciuill Allegiance.</hi> But this we deny and haue often denied, and still must deny, and craue the proofe at <hi>M. Barlowes</hi> hands, who though he hath often affirmed the same, yet hath he neuer proued it by any one argument worth the reciting, which notwithstanding is the only or principall thing that he should proue. For that being once proued, all controuersie about this Oath were ended. And it is a strange kind of demeanour, so often and euery where to affirme it,<note place="margin">A foolish wrangling of M. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</note> and neuer to proue it. He addeth for his reason in this place: <hi>He that prohibits the swearing against a vsurping deposer, denieth temporall obedience to his rightfull Soueraigne</hi>: and sayth neuer a word more. But what doth this proue?
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:14527:223"/>
Or in what forme is this argument? For if vnto this <hi>Maior</hi> proposition he shall add a <hi>Minor,</hi> that we do so, or that the Popes <hi>Breue</hi> doth so, we vtterly deny it as manifestly false. For who will say that the Popes <hi>Breue</hi> prohibits swearing <hi>against an vsurping deposer?</hi> Or what Catholike will say that his refusall of swearing is against such a one, and not rather against the authority of his lawfull Pastour?

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of a Catholike man from swearing? But how doth be proue by this, that I confesse the <hi>Breue</hi> to forbid tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Obedience? Do you marke, I pray you, his inference, and consider his <hi>acumen.</hi>

                     </gap> is as much to say, as there is not a lawfull clause in it.</hi> So he: &amp; this me thinks is to great an vntruth to begin withal.<note place="margin">A great vntruth to begin wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth not only not say this, which he imposeth vpon him, but sayth the quite contrary, to wit: <hi>Vt Iuramentum recuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur non est necessarium, vt cos &amp; singulae partes eius sint male: satis est, vt velvna sit mala.</hi> That the Oath may be refused, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that al &amp; euery part therof be naught, it is inough that one only be naught. Is not this plaine inough?</p>
               <p>Next after this he taketh in hand the defence of that translation of the Cardinalls subscription vnto his Letter <hi>Your very reuerend brother Robert Cardinall Bellarmine</hi>: the latin being as you haue now seene, <hi>Admodum Rdae</hi>

               <p>But yet further <hi>M. Barlow</hi> hath another shift, saying: that in the written copy D. in the end had such a dash, as it might be taken for <hi>dus</hi> or <hi>dae.</hi> But this shift is worse then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the rest, for so much as that D. doth not stand in the end of the subscription, but in the very beginning, as hath byn seene by the words before set downe, which are <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>To this declaration of myne <hi>M.

But first to the Cardinalls six argumentes he s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To my reason of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Oath of Supremacy and this of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, for that this is modified and tempered with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent clauses of thinges partly touching ciuil Obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and partly Religion, wheras the other is simply of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, against the Popes Supremacy: to this, I say, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth with this interrogation: <hi>If this Oath be so modified i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he Censurer the greatest affliction and pressure, that euer befel the Catholickes?</hi> Do you see what a question he maketh, and how farre from the purpose? My intention was, and is to proue, that for so much as Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did particulerly impugne this mixt and tempered Oath, therfore he did not mistake the question by impugning only the other Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, as was obiected; there being between them this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference amongst others, that the one, to wit of Allegia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, is compounded of different clauses (as hath bene said) partly touching ciuill Obedience, and partly Religion:
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:14527:237"/>
wheras this other of Supremacy is simply of Religion. This was my demonstration. And to what purpose then (for answere of this) was brought in that other dem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> asking vs very seriously why this second Oath should be afflictiue vnto vs, if it be modifyed and tempered? Is there any sense in this? We say, for so much as it is compounded and tempered, as the other is not, therfore it was meant by the Cardinal, and not the other: <hi>M.

And it is strange that a man of sense will ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue so, or make so senselesse a demand. For why, or how doth this doctour deny heere the other two articles of true Catholick doctrine? For that he did not tell them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly which of the clauses contayned <hi>Arianis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </hi>? First this maketh not to our case of the Oath of Allegiance, for

that we set downe clerly the claus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly it was not necessary to tell the clause in particuler that contayned the <hi>Arianisme,</hi> for that some of the people perhaps, that demaunded him the question could not well vnderstand it, and therefore it was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to say, that the oath was, as it lay, naught: that there was some heresie therin: as if a Phisitian should say of a dish of myn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Or was it perhaps for that the Doctour said that the whole Oath as it lay,<note place="margin">M.

And secondly we see, that he doth not condemne al the parts of this oath, for that some be vnlawfull, but rather proueth the contrary out of the common sentence of Philosophers, that if any one part be euil, it is sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to make the Oath euil &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.

And so in this Oath, to make it vnlawful, it is inough that any one clause therof be naught, or against a Catholick mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, but to make it good and lawfull, al the clauses therof must be good and lawfull.

or make it naught. But herein framing this new Oath, and the articles therof, there is not the consent or agreement of al those that are required to take the Oath, nor obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of conscience to agree: but rather to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they are bound by the principles of their religion to disagree, and disclaime against the same, as preiudicial to their soules. So as here those articles, or different clauses. are not as <hi>Prouiso's</hi> agreed vpon, as in an Indenture, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as points, and conditions proposed and required by the Landlord, wherof the Tenant may by right deliberate and consider, whether they stand wel for him or noe.

                  <p>But yet before I end this matter, on which he standeth so much, I would demand him further, whether this his assertion be not general concerning al Kings, and he may not wel deny it, for that his reason is general as presently ensueth; saying,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>The King being once in lawful possession, whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer shal say, that he may be deposed for any cause, denieth that he is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full King.</hi> Wherupon it followeth, that the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> &amp; <hi>Spaine</hi> also are no lawful, or true Kings in the opinion of their subiects, for that they al with vniforme consent, do hould this doctrine of the Church, that Kings and Princes may in some cases <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It followeth also by this inference of <hi>M.

               <p>There remayneth only then now for the conclusion of this Chapter, to see and weigh the comparisons that may be made betweene this Oath of fidelity of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish subiects vnto their King <hi>Sisenandus</hi> (the keeping wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is so earnestly recommended by this Councell) and this other English Oath of Allegiance, required by his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

wherin I sayd I found no more parity or semblance, but as that was an Oath of ciuill Obedience to their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Prince, so is this also in some clauses, and therfore as the Councel did well allow, yea much recommend and incharge the keeping of that Oath to King <hi>Sisenand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi>: so do all good Catholickes desire the obseruation of the foresaid clauses contayned in this Oath, so far forth, as they concerne the said temporall obedience.

               <p>Well then, what saith M. <hi>Barlow</hi> to this conclusion? Certes he seeketh so say many things, but so far from the purpose, that he truly may be sayd to say nothing. He setteth downe clauses of my speach, with his answers thus. First, quoth I, there is noe partyculer forme of an oath put downe in the Councell and consequently this new forme could not be taken from that. He answereth; <hi>Can an oath be kept which was not first taken?</hi> But what is this to the purpose: for the question is not, whether the Spaniards did take an Oath to their King or not, for that is graunted, but whether the forme of the oath were like to this of ours. And yet as though he had answered to the purpose he goeth forward to proue that an Oath was taken. <hi>It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But I would demaund of M. <hi>Barlow,</hi> what was the question betweene vs? Was it whether there were euer any oath of Allegiance to temporall Princes allowed, or taken in the Christian world before this of ours? For if this were the question, then hath he sufficiently euicted his purpose, by shewing that so long ago an oath of Allegia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was allowed in the Councell of <hi>Toledo.</hi> But if this was not the question, but only whether there was a like Oath to this in forme or matter allowed in the Councell of <hi>Toledo,</hi> then hath M. <hi>Barlow</hi> euicted nothing, but his own disgrace, for that he hath run quite from the purpose.</p>
               <p>And yet to seeme to say somewhat, he returneth agayne afterward to speake of the forme, and matter of this oath, recommended in the Councell of <hi>Toledo.</hi>
                  <q>And first he sheweth, that albeit the forme be not expressed in the Councel, yet must it be persumed to haue bene made in the name of God, as is commaunded in Deuteronomy the 6.</q> But this is very general.
Then he setteth downe a certayne Protestation made by the Bishops, and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops in the sixt Councell of <hi>Toledo,</hi> for the temporall safety of their Prince, in these words: <hi>Ideo testamur <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And secondly I say, that this is so far different from the forme of our new oath of Allegiance, now exacted as nothing can be more; which euery man will see by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them togeather: for I hope <hi>M. Barlow</hi> will not allow the inuocation of Angells, Prophetts, Apostles &amp; Martyrs called for witnesses, as heere is vsed: and so the formes are nothing like, nor is this an Oath made to the King. But let vs see somewhat more of this matter.</p>
               <p>He alleageth my exception, <hi>that the Oath in the Councell confirmed, was an Oath of ciuill Allegiance only, which neither the Catholikes refuse, now Pope</hi> Paulus <hi>doth prohibite.</hi> Against which he maketh a long idle discourse, that the same thinges are contayned in the one, and the other Oath, as the safety of the King, the preseruation of his life and Crowne, and the like. Which though in some part it be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be true (and in this we haue no difficulty to agree with him:) yet is not this only sought in the new Oath, but the deniall also of the Popes authority.

                  <p>There followeth a certaine small controuersie, about the words <hi>temperate,</hi> and <hi>tempered,</hi> whether they signify the same or no: wherof we haue handled somewhat before, &amp; so shall dispatch it here in a word. Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had said in his Letter to <hi>M. Blackwell,</hi> that this Oath is not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lawfull because it is offered as <hi>tempered,</hi> and <hi>modified, with diuers clauses of ciuill Obedience,</hi> giuing an example out of <hi>S.

<pb n="388" facs="tcp:14527:255"/>
of the Emperours, and their false Gods. And if <hi>M. Bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

It followeth in my Letter, concerning the answering of two questions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the <hi>Apologer,</hi> wherin I shall repeate againe my owne words then vttered: thus then I wrote. That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologer hauing said with great vehemency of asseueratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">

To the first, that if it be graunted, that power &amp; authority of the Pope, and Sea Apostolike left by Christ, for gouerning his Church in all occasions and necessities, be any poynt belonging to Religion among Catholikes, then is there not only some owne word, but many senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yea ten or twelue articles, or branches therin, <hi>tending</hi> and <hi>sounding</hi> that way, as before hath bene shewed.</q>

not this include eyther beliefe or vnbeliefe? Againe:
<q>
                        <hi>I do further sweare, that I do from my hart abhorre, detest, &amp; abiure, as impious &amp; hereticall, that damnable doctrine, &amp; position, That Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which be excommunicated, and depriued by the Pope, may be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed &amp;c.</hi> Doth not here the swearer promise, not to belieue that doctrine which he so much detesteth? How then doth the Apologer so grossely forget, and contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, euen then, when he goeth about to proue contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in his Aduersary?</q>
                  </p>

                        <hi>And I do belieue, and in conscience am resolued, that neyther the Pope, nor any person whatsoeuer, hath power to absolue me from this Oath, or any part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> These words are plaine as you see. And what will the Apologer say heere? Is nothing promised in those words to be belieued, or not belieued?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was my speach. And now see what quarrell M. <hi>Barlow</hi> seeketh agaynst it. First wheras in my answer to the first question, I say, if it be granted, that the power and authority of the Pope, and Sea Apostolicke &amp;c. be any point belonging to religion among Catholicks, then is there not only some one word, but many sentences concerning Religion in the Oath. What answereth <hi>M. Barlow? This Epistler</hi> (saith he) <hi>doth impudently impugne the Oath as vtterly vnlawfull, and agaynst religion, which yet dependeth vpon an</hi> If,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>and is not yet determined for a point of religion, that the Pope hath any such authority ouer Kings, as in the Oath is mentioned.</hi> No Syr? not among Catholiks? (for of them only I speake, though you leaue it out, and doe many wayes corrupt my words:) Will not they grant the Popes authority in such cases to be a point belonging to their Religion?<note place="margin">M. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueling.</note> Doth the word <hi>If</hi> put the matter in doubt, that when you say, <hi>If</hi> there be a God, this or that is true or false, you may be said to doubt, whether there be a God or no? And when you say, <hi>If</hi> I be a true man, this is so, you may be thought to doubt, whether your selfe be a true man or no? Do not you see that this is playne cauelling indeed, and not disputing? But what more? You say that when I do affirme the Popes power, I do not distinguish whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:14527:256"/>
in Ecclesiasticall or ciuill causes: but you know well inough that I haue often distinguished, and so do other Catholicke Deuines, that the Popes authority is <hi>directly</hi> only Ecclesiasticall and spirituall, for gouerning and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of soules to euerlasting life; though <hi>indirectly</hi> for conseruation of this Ecclesiasticall, and Spirituall end, there is annexed also Temporall, in such cases, as before hath bene specified, concerning temporall Princes. And so this is but a shift to say, that I doe not distinguish.</p>
                  <p>As that is also another, about my answere to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond demaund of the Apologer, where he demandeth whether any man that taketh the Oath, doth promise to belieue, or not to belieue any one article of religion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in the said Oath. For answere wherunto, I did set downe sundry clauses of the said Oath, wherby it seemeth plaine, that the swearer doth make such promise. Now you reply with this new shift, saying, <hi>that I doe still beg the question in controuersy.</hi> So you talke to seem to say somwhat. But what is the question in controuersy? Is it not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the swearer doth make promise to belieue, or not to belieue any article of religion, in taking the Oath? Yes. And I haue proued that he doth so, by diuers examples. How then doe I beg the question, when I do euince it by proofe? You reply, <hi>that these articles abiured, or allowed by him that takes the Oath,</hi>

Barlows</hi> assertions, that depend on the pleasures of Prince &amp; State, alteration of times, and temporall vtilities (wherof <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiauel</hi> was a great Doctour,) then to the simple positions of Catholikes, who without these worldly respects, do playnly and sincerely imbrace and belieue, all such points of doctrine as the knowne Catholike Church doth deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto them, as any way appertayning to the integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                  <p>Heere then <hi>M.

               <p>Another argument of the Popes murthers is made to be, for that he is said to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded the body of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4.

               <p>In relating which words, we see that <hi>M.

               <p>But now you must heare the trymming of another, which is <hi>Cuspinian</hi> the Historiographer, whom I denied before, to affirme that Pope <hi>Paschalis</hi> was enraged with the new Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, for burying his Father, as was said in the Apologie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lett. p.</hi> 87.</note> but rather the contrary.
<q>For that when King <hi>Henry</hi> the Father (said I) was dead, and buryed in a Monastery at <hi>Leige, Cuspinian</hi> writeth, that his Sonne would not make peace with the Bishop of that place, called <hi>Otbert,</hi> except the dead corpes were pulled out of the graue againe: which words he sayth, that I alleadged as <hi>Cuspinian</hi> his owne words.</q>
But I deny it, but only I alledged his sense, as may appeare in that I did not recite them in a different letter, as is accustomed by them that deale playnly, when the proper words of any Author are alleaged, though <hi>M. Barlow</hi> doth not obserue this with

And for so much, as his reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the said Bishops did imply also his reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Emperour, he that letted the one, letted the other, which was the yong Emperour himself, who though himself would not for respectes (the Bishop being a potent man) vtterly deny to admyt his submission; yet did he procure the stay therof by others (to wit, by the Archbishops and Bishops) vntill he had yielded vnto the condition of taking vp the dead body, &amp; conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the thing is true, which I alledged out of <hi>Cuspinian</hi> that the yong Emperour would not make peace with the Bishop of <hi>Leige</hi> except the body were taken vp; for so much as himself was he, that had letted that reconciliation, as here appeareth, and procured also as may be supposed the great reprehension which was giuen to the said Bishop and his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, when they were admitted, wherof <hi>Crantzius</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth when he sayth, <hi>ad fidem Regis confugie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes grauiter increpati rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>what needed any procurement by himselfe to himself?</hi> which is a fallacy, for that a man being desirous to stay a sute, &amp; yet not willing to take all the enuy vpon himselfe, may procure that the stay may seeme to come from others.

Yes to the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Bishops and others, out of whose communion he was cast forth before, as now hath bene shewed. The fourth vntruth is, that the Pope had exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the Church and all Church-men of <hi>Liege,</hi> for burying of the Emperour, which cannot be true, as now hath bene declared, for that in so short a space as 2. or 3. dayes, newes could not be sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and answere be returned; and much lesse such an Excommunication be sent.

Ad hoc respondit Paschalis &amp;c.</hi> To this demaund of the Emperour, about the buryall of his Father. Pope <hi>Paschalis</hi> answered:
<q>The authority of holy Scripture is against this, and the reuerence we beare to diuine miracles doth forbid the same, for that Martyrs themselues now placed in heauen haue dreadfully co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, that the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casses of haynous wicked men should be cast out of their Chappells, and with whom we haue not had communion in their liues, we may not communicate when they are dead. </q>These are the words of <hi>Paschalis verbatim,</hi> which M. <hi>Barlow</hi> hath trymmed to his purpose, as you see.
For if he had set them downe sincerely as he found them in the Authour, they would not haue appeared so ridiculous, as he desired they should appeare, and therefore spiced them after his owne fashion.

                  <p>This was the sentence, which is graue and weighty as yow see, for that the whole Parlament affirmeth, that such impediments were discouered by Gods infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="427" facs="tcp:14527:277"/>
that the lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was neuer his true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full daughter. And did not this deserue, that <hi>M. Barlow</hi> should haue brought forth authenticall testimony to the contrary? For if this attestation of the Parlament, King, and Metropolitan were good and true, that Queene <hi>Anne</hi> was neuer in her life lawfull wife to King <hi>Henry,</hi> then could not any future Parlament, though neuer so faine it would, afterward make her legitimate, or lawfully giue her the Crowne, in preiudice of the next lawful heire, after Queene <hi>Maries</hi> death, which at that time was his Maiesties Mother Queene of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>

                  <p>But here now <hi>M.

That if the illegitimation had bin in her bloud, no law could make it good? Wherein then I pray you was this illegitimation? Was it in her bones, or in her flesh, or skinne? For in one of these foure it must needs be: for asmuch as it descended by her birth from her Father &amp; Mother. <hi>But,</hi> saith <hi>M Barlow,</hi>

of themselues, and that it is lawfull also by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ancient Saints, for good men to comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with that hope and confidence: yet the surest way is to repose all in the benignity and mercy of almighty God, who giueth all, and is the Authour, aswell of the grace, as of the merits, and fruits of good workes that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue therof. And thus hath Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated his mind in this one Chapter, about <hi>Confidence in good workes,</hi> by soluing the foresaid three different Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherof the one is not contrary to the other, but may all three stand togea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>This was may declaration, and explication of Card. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> doctrine, in this point, whether any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence might be placed in good workes, and what his counsaile is therin. Wherunto, though M. <hi>Barlow</hi> finding himself vnable to make any substantial reply, do multiply words from the matter, without answering directly, to any one of these points now set downe, and much lesse, to the authorityes of Scriptures, and other proofes allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the same: yet shall we take an accompt of him what he saith, reducing him back againe to these heades, as they lye in my letter, now recited, and see whether they make any iust satisfaction for an answere or no.</p>
               <p>First then, whereas I required, as you haue heard, that for prouing this first contradiction, obiected to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> that one only sentence, might be brought forth, out of all his fiue bookes of <hi>Iustification,</hi> that is truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to the foresaid proposition, counsailing to put our whole confidence in Gods onely mercy: this hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to is not done, which notwithstanding had beene easy to do, if the whole current of these fiue bookes, as there was said, had beene contradictory to this proposition.

               <p>But let vs heare him further. <hi>It is hypocrisy</hi> (saith he) <hi>not righteousnes, which is not true: if not righteousnes, then not inhere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi> Whereunto I answere, that this is not true which he saith first, for that all defect of true righteousnes, maketh not hypocrisy, but onely when a man pretendeth to be iust, and is not. But if a man should doubt, whether his righteousnes be perfect or no (which is our case) then were it no hypocrisy at all, and if it were, then were it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent hypocrisy in the hypocrite, which is contrary to the other inference of <hi>M. Barlow:</hi> that if it were not true, and perfect righteousnes, it were not inherent, for that be it true or false, perfect or vnperfect, such as it is, it must needs be inherent in the subiect, which it doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate.</p>
               <p>And this is <hi>M. Barlowes</hi> wise discourse, about the first part of his two-membred proposition, of <hi>incertitudo rei, &amp; personae</hi>; incertainty of the thing it selfe, or of the person (to wit) of righteousnes it selfe, or of him that hath it. Now he commeth vnto the second, about the person, saying: <hi>If the vncertainty be of the person, then the second part of the proposition, concerning merit, is cut of: for merit raiseth a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but where there is no comfort, there can be no confidence; and in vncertainty there is no comfort.</hi> Which speach is so prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vttered, as how many inferences, so many plaine
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:14527:282"/>
falsities there be in the same. As first, that where there is no comfort, there can be no confidence. For that <hi>Iob</hi> in his tribulations, was greatly abandoned of comfort, and yet he said to God, <hi>Albeit thou shalt kill me, yet will I hope in thee,</hi> and it is an ordinary thing with God to take away oftentimes sensible comforts from good men, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding do not loose their confidence in him, and his mercies for the same.</p>
               <p>The other proposition also is false, <hi>that in vncertainty there is no com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e to the examining of the other three propositions or resolutions of <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine</hi> before mentioned. In the meane space, you see how well and substantially <hi>M.

                     </gap>er whome, as if the Cardinall were gasping for breath vnder the blow he hath recieued for his contradictions, he braues it with some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>This is his confidence, which I grant commeth not of merits, but of onely faith, or rather presumption, and therefore I meane not to impugne it. He saith then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my answere before set downe, out of my Letter; first of all, that <hi>Bellarmines</hi> case standing so bad in it selfe as it did, I m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>de it farre worse, by seeking to assist him: and for proof hereof he saith, that I, supposing the Cardinall to handle the controuersy by questions and answeres, wherby it seemes that I neuer read the place myselfe, do summe vp the Chapter in way of Interogatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; solution.
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:14527:283"/>
Whereto first I answere, that the many particulers, which I do set downe out of that Chapter, whence the proposition is taken, aswell of Scriptures, and other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, must needs conuince <hi>M. Barlow,</hi> that I had read the whole Chapter, and so he cannot say this heere, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his owne conscience.</p>
               <p>Secondly it is true, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth not handle those three assertions of his by the way of questions, and solutions, but onely by way of assirmatiue, and resolute propositions. But I thought it best, and more cleare for the English Readers vnderstanding to frame the questions of my self, and take the summe of his said propositions, for answers and solutions to the same. What can <hi>M. Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>low</hi> mislike in this? He sayth, that I haue wrongfully set down the Cardinalls meaning, and namely in the first question, and that there is no such thing in the whole Chapter. Let vs examine then this.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">M. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows false charge vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaty.</note>
                  <hi>The first question then,</hi> said I, <hi>is whether good works in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man doe increase hope, and confidence, by their owne nature, &amp; the promise of reward made vnto them. And Bellarmine answereth that they do, and proueth it by many places of Scripture.</hi> Thus I said: &amp; doth not <hi>Bellarmine</hi> allow this doctrine? Or doth he not teach any such thing in this chapter? Let the reader per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use it, and blush for M. <hi>Barlow</hi> that affirmeth it. But he giueth an instance saying: <hi>Neither Bellarmine, nor any other Deuine, eyther Protestant or Papist, will say good works increase confidence in their owne nature.</hi> But good Syr, is your nature such, or lack of grace so great, that you can speake nothing without manifest falshood? I say that good works in a Christian man, do increase hope and confidence, by their owne nature, &amp; the promise of reward made vnto them.

                     </gap>ture, and Gods promise of reward.</hi> Wherby I doe meane that being workes so qualified, they do of themselues, and by their owne nature of meritorious works increase hope and confidence in the worker, though he for his part, do not place any confidence in them. These then are the first cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions vsed by <hi>M. Barlow</hi> vpon my words. Why did he alter them, and not recite them as I set them downe?</p>
               <p>But let vs see a second proofe of his. He alleadgeth <hi>Card. Bellarmine</hi> against me, saying, that he distinguisheth betweene good workes, and merits, for that all good workes are not meritorious: and so say I too. For that good morall workes, may be in Infidels, as hath bene said, for they may do almsdeeds, &amp; other such good things, but they cannot be meritorious, for that they do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from grace, &amp; haue not the promise to God made vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What then doth this make against me? Nay har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken I pray you what ensueth: he bringeth the wordes of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> against me, saying: <hi>that if good workes should be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But hath he any more to say, thinke you, against the first question? or doth he answere one word to the plaine testimony of Scriptures, alleadged out of <hi>Toby, Iob,</hi> and <hi>S.

No, not so much as one word, and much lesse to those other, that stand in <hi>Bellarmines</hi> booke, which are more in number, as neyther to the ancient Fathers <hi>S. Cyprian, S. Chrysostome, S. Ambrose, S.

<pb n="440" facs="tcp:14527:284"/>
albeit he do not of himselfe place any confidence in them, but respecteth onely, and relyeth vpon God almightyes grace &amp; mercy; for that so it may often fall out (and it is to be noted and borne in mind) that a man may haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence by good works,<note place="margin">Good workes may giue cause of confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce although a man put no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in them, but onely in Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy.</note> and yet place no confidence in good works; for that a vertuous life enriched with many meritorious actions, may of it self giue a man much confidence, for the life to come, though he for his part do not place any confidence therin, but only in Gods mercy: so as now we see the first propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to be true, <hi>that the confidence of holy m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherto I answere, that if these things be well considered, there is no contradiction; for that the knowledg of our merits, which is required before we can put any iust confidence in them, is a morall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg only, such as may stand with some vncertainty, as is to be seene in many things of this world. As for exmple, a man borne now in <hi>England,</hi> is morally certaine, that he is baptized, for that he is tould so by his parents and others, for that the Ministers do odinarily baptize infants in the Parish where they dwell: but for that he doth not know certainly, whether he that did baptize him, had the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Church, and vsed the forme of words pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, it may stand with some vncertainty, whether he be baptized or no. And the like is in marriage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is morall certainty, that a man and woman that haue liued togeather many yeares in wed-locke, are truly husband and wife: but yet for that there is not absolute assurance, that both parts did consent in hart to that marryage, it may stand with some vncertainty, whether the mariage were good or no. And so in infinite other thinges. And in this our case it is euident, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg required by the Cardinal of our merits, is but morall, such as may stand with some vncertainty; for though we should know, that we haue giuen almes aboundantly, redeemed captiues, nourished orphans, visited the sicke, and imprisoned, and done other good works co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended by our Sauiour, that promised life euer lasting to the same: yet because we know not whether we haue done them with all due circumstances or no, it is but a morall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg

                  <p>This was the summe of my answer: and the <hi>Cardinalls</hi> booke comming out afterwards, hath the same in effect in these words:<note place="margin">

Barlow</hi> sayth he doth, that the <hi>Emperour found it to be the Popes doing</hi>: for all that can be truly gathered out of these wordes, is, that the Emperour suspected some such thing in the <hi>Pope.</hi> And so far is <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that it was found to be true, that hauing said that the Popes fame was therby much blemished; he addeth this restrictiue clause, as from himself, <hi>Veritatem tamen nouit Deus secretorum scutator infallibilis:</hi> but God knoweth the truth, who is the infallible searcher of secrets, as though he had sayd, that this matter had no other ground then the Emperours suspition, and slaunder of his scisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical followers, for had there bene but any apparent proof therof, it would haue bene layed open to the vttermost. And to confirme this, the same Author a little before the wordes now rehearsed, saith, that the enemies of the Church gaue out, that the Pope had sought to corrupt <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus de Vineis</hi> to poyson the Emperour. So then to conclude, wheras out of this Author <hi>M. Barlow</hi> saith, that <hi>Fredericke vpon examination found it to be the Popos doing,</hi> there is no such thing to be found: that which we find, is that <hi>M. Barlow</hi> either corrupteth, or corruptly alleadgeth all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors which he dealeth with.</p>
                  <p>But now you may thinke, that he hath kept a sure card for the last, and bringeth forth an Author without all checke or controll, who with his verie name will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbeare

of Historie, Humanity, Philosophy, or Diuinity. But not to stand longer on these trifles, but to draw to an end of the whole matter, in which M. <hi>Barlows</hi> manifold mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinges haue made me the longer, it will not be amisse for conclusion hereof, to lay good Reader, before thine eyes, all the errors &amp; vntruthes, that in this matter only <hi>M.

                  <p>Vntrue then it is, that the Emperor was excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated vpon sleyght pretences,<note place="margin">M.

It is vntrue, that the Emperour was sent into the Holy Land, that the Pope might rifle his State at home. Thirdly it is vntrue, that the Emperour stayed for sicknes, which (euen by them who were with the <hi>Emperour</hi>) was testified to be but seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Againe it is not true, that for the same stay he was exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated, but for his returne with the Nauie, after he had set forth to sea.

               <p>AMONG other points that were impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned out of <hi>Cardinall Bellarmines</hi> Letter, were certaine sentences, examples, and authorities of ancient Fathers, about the Oath. <hi>And first of all was the comparison of the subtill art, and deceipt</hi> (said I) <hi>vsed by</hi> Iulian <hi>the Emperour, surnamed the Apostata,</hi> and recounted by S. <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen,</hi> in placing, and inserting the Images of his false Gods, into the pictures of the Emperour, in his Imperiall banner, so as no man could bow downe, and do reuerence to the Emperours picture (as then was the custome) but that he must adore also the Images of the false Gods; which art of tem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:14527:337"/>
the Cardinall doth compare vnto this mixture, and combination of clauses, lawfull and vnlawfull; ciuill and ecclesiasticall, in the Oath proposed: so as, a man cannot sweare the one, but he must sweare also the other: for which cause, I said in my Letter, that the whole Oath with all the clauses, as it lyeth (in which sense, it hath bin also forbidden by his Holynes) cannot in any wise be taken, although touching some one only clause, not only cyuill, but also ecclesiasticall, as for example, of the Popes authority, of charity I might thinke (as then I wrote) that the Priests who tooke the Oath, tooke it in some such sense, as being explycated by them, and accepted of the Magistrate, might stand with the integrity of fayth. And that the sense of the sayd clause, might be agreed vpon, betwene his Maiesty and his subiects, in such sort as it should agree with the opinion, and practise of all other Catholicke Princes. But the whole Oath as it lyeth, is no other, then the picture of the Emperour, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with the Images of false Gods. Which similitude and comparison, though it expresse most fitly (as it seemeth) the matter in hand: yet was it impugned, by seeking out dissimilitudes, &amp; disparities in other pointes, then wherein was made the sayd comparison. As for example, that first <hi>Iulian</hi> was an <hi>Apostata,</hi> but our Souerai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne is a Christian: <hi>Iulian</hi> changed the religion he once professed, but our King not: <hi>Iulian</hi> became an Ethnick, or Atheist, our King is not ashamed of his profession: <hi>Iulian</hi> dealt against Christians, his Maiesty dealeth only to make a distinction betweene true subiects, and false harted traytors &amp;c. And so he goeth forward, alleadging many sundry diuersityes, betwene man and man, thing and things, state &amp; states: which I said is nothing to our purpose. For a similitude requireth not likenes, or parity in all poyntes, for then it should be <hi>idem,</hi> and not <hi>simile,</hi> but liknes only in the point, wherin the comparison is made, as here in the compounding, and couching togeather of lawfull, and vnlawfull cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>His point of comparison was this; that as <hi>Iulian</hi> did set forth in his banner, and combine togeather the images, as well of the Emperour, as of the false Gods, seeking to temper and mollify the one by the other; to wit, by bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, and honouring the Emperours image (which then was held for lawfull) to bow also, or seeme to bow at leastwise to the other, which was not lawfull: so in the Oath are combined togeather different clauses, some of temporall obedience, which are lawfull; some oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus far are the words of <hi>M. Barlow,</hi> who being well, (as you haue seene) towards the end, intangleth himself, and runneth quite from the purpose. He acknowledgeth in the beginning, that the comparison of <hi>Card.

Bellarmine</hi> made not his comparison,<note place="margin">M. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> no more then betwene the banner it selfe, and the Oath; or betweene the silke cloath wherein the pictures were painted, or the booke or paper wherin the Oath was written, or in any other such like differences, as might be pickt out, wherof this also is one, very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the matter, that the banner did tend to a mixt ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but not the Oath to a mixt allegiance, of which
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:14527:339"/>
mixt allegiance <hi>Card. Bellarmine</hi> neuer spake word, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that as the mixture of these Images was deuised to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the Christians at that tyme; so the mixture of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent clauses, some conteyning ciuill obedience, some ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall disobedience, the one law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ull, the other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, was deuised to intangle the consciences of the Catholikes. And so we see, that <hi>M.

               <p>The second example which is reprehended in <hi>Cardinall Bellarmines</hi> letter, is out of the second booke of <hi>Machabees,</hi> of old <hi>Eleazar</hi> that venerable man, who rather chose to die, then to do a thing vnlawfull, and against his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, or to seeme to doe it by dissimulation.

               </p>
               <p>This was answered at that tyme. Now M. <hi>Barlow</hi> commeth with new deuises.

                     <hi>Hier.</hi> 4.</note> when true and iust things are sworne; but euery Oath in particuler is not warranted by Scripture; and namely if it containe any thing, that eyther in it self, or in the swearers iudgment, and conscience is not true, or lawfull. And such is this Oath to Catholiks in both respectes, and therefore not warranted, but condemned by Scripture.</p>
               <p>Thirdly he sayth, when I am at a stand, and can go no further, I do wind my self out, by ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place of conscience, and Catholike religion. But what sayth he, if there be a false assumption, and an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true applycation by the conscience, is it then erroneous, and not binding? As put the case, the conscience assumeth that to be sound and Catholike, which is false and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian doctrine.<note place="margin">An erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science bindeth.</note> To this question I haue answered now sufficiently before, and haue largly proued, that an erroneous conscience also byndeth vntill it be reformed; and that it is impiety, and ignorance to teach the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: nor shall it be needfull to repeat all the reasons and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments here. This one may stand insteed of all the rest, which is the ground of all, That if a man may without sinne do against the dictamen or direction of his owne conscience, then may he do that which he thinketh to be naught, and consequently do naught, wittingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:14527:340"/>
without sin, which is against the groundes both of Diuinity, Philosophy, and Nature it self. And yet M. <hi>Barlow</hi> is so wise, as to affirme here, that an erroneous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science byndeth not.</p>
