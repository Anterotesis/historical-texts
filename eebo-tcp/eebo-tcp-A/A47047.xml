            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To His Excellency ARTHUR
<hi>Earl of ESSEX, Viscount</hi> Malden, <hi>Baron</hi> Capel <hi>of</hi> Hadham, <hi>Lord Lieutenant General, and General Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of His Majesties Kingdom of</hi> Ireland, <hi>Lord Lieutenant of the County of</hi> Hartford, <hi>and one of the Lords of His Majesties most Honourable Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of both Kingdoms.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Most Honourable,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>How much <hi>Ireland</hi> (happy in your Government) is above all other Nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> influenced by the power of <hi>Rome,</hi> is to Your Excellency well known, as to the world, and by themselves also acknowledged, and gloried in.</p>
            <p>But unhappy is it in being thereby, and by <hi>Romish</hi> Emissaries (of malevolent and factious principles promoting other interesses) carried on fatally, to the disturbance of the peace of the Kingdom. Of this we have had Memorials of former Ages, some of them fresh and bleeding; nor are we even now without jealousies of what may yet be, were there opportunity for it.</p>
            <p>This is not to be ascribed to the stars, or clime, or nature of the people, who have had of old the character, justly, of a people peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, harmless, affable to strangers, and in themselves, and to all, pious
<pb facs="tcp:63582:3"/>
and good. So was it, while the Religion professed by their Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers was according to the primitive faith of purer times of the Church (although not then without some soil.) And thus find we it even now in those of the Nation who are of reformed and purer principles.</p>
            <p>But being in after times corrupted in Doctrine and Discipline, and that the now Religion of the <hi>Irish</hi> is quite another thing from that of their forefathers (of whom yet they boast themselves Children, both as to faith and blood) we now find the Change great, as in Religion, so in disposition and manners:</p>
            <p>On which we collect, that the grounds of our peace from those, must not be <hi>Extirpation,</hi> but <hi>Reformation,</hi> by removing those their false Teachers, who mis-inform and mis-lead the Nation; and our withal instructing the people in the waies of peace and truth.</p>
            <p>As to the latter I have observed, no people more desirous than are these to hear and to be instructed, nor any better, being so educated.</p>
            <p>In which I cannot but mention and recommend as a president to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the zeal of a pious and learned Prelate, the present <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Cashel,</hi> who has set himself on that work industriously by instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Irish</hi> in their own language; and hath already gathered the comfortable fruits of his godly labours, drawing in and retaining ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Nation firm in the faith, the number also of such encreasing.</p>
            <p>The means for that in former times, and in some of our own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, was the translating and Printing our <hi>English</hi> Lyturgy, and the New Testament into the <hi>Irish</hi> tongue, that testifying our care of their salvation, and giving them thereby to understand in their own language the truth we profess and teach, contrary to the mis-informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others concerning us.</p>
            <p>And to this purpose that learned Prelate Doctor <hi>Bedell</hi> late Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop of <hi>Kilmore</hi> (happy in his Zeal and labours that way) to that of the <hi>New Testament</hi> and <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> before translated and Printed in the <hi>Irish</hi> tongue, did add the <hi>Translation into Irish of the Old Testament</hi> also, with <hi>David's Psalms in meter.</hi> This I have in my hands in the manuscript, and wish it were for such a publick good, printed and published.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:63582:3"/>In the mean time, to give some stop, if it might be, to the Current of Popery, I conceived in might be convenient and necessary that it be known and declared to this mis-lead people, as to others, <hi>who that is whom they so follow, that he is that very Antichrist, by whom they may be carried away by that deluge of Apostacy into perdition,</hi> wherby these may by grace be brought to consider their waies.</p>
            <p>This is that which is in the following Treasise intended, and is, I hope to some evidenced, which appearing, other points and erroneous Doctrines of Popery will fall, depending on that the principal.</p>
            <p>Of this in my late preaching it, I had the honour of your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies being then an hearer; and being prevailed with after for publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, I thought it fittest for your Lordships Patronage, in whose hands is the Government of that people for whom this is particularly design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. it was a confident presumption in him, who under the letters <hi>I. S.</hi> (it may be, far from his name) did <hi>offer to your Patronage an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective against that Church of which you are, The Church of</hi> England <hi>your Mother, as not being the Church of Christ, nor any part of it</hi>; which had its full confutation by a learned piece, Doctor <hi>Andrew Sall,</hi> I hope the contrary may find better acceptance from your Excellency, this shewing <hi>that the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>of which J.</hi> S. <hi>shews himself to be, is ANTICHRISTIAN, and communion there to be unto some dangerous, and damnable to others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is in this my Comfort, which was St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s speaking before King <hi>Agrippa</hi>) that I <hi>speak to one who knoweth these things. And from whom I am perswaded (none of these things are hidden,</hi> Acts 26.3.26.) For your Excellency is not a favourer only of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but you your self also learned eminently, and particularly versed in Church-Antiquities, on which most of that here spoken, is depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Which your affection to Learning appears in your large collection of Books, with which that your rich and compleat Library in <hi>England</hi> is stored. The same of which hath crossed the Seas hither, as elsewhere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad There may the learned find knowledge in variety, beside what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Records both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> such as are not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
<pb facs="tcp:63582:4"/>
where, unto which recourse may be had as to a <hi>VATICAN.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to <hi>Ireland,</hi> considering the few years of your Government over us, I dare confidently aver, that none, so as your Lordship, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth so much of the Kingdom, People, Manners, and several Interesses there, and understands better the Measures, for governing answerably; and such a person so knowing, this Kingdom requires.</p>
            <p>In your Excellency shines the Heroick Vertue and Courage of that renowned Martyr for King and Country, your illustrious Father; and that well tempered with your own personal Affability taking with, and obliging all; yet to each with a becoming distance of state and place, so as none to presume on more than just favour in Judgment, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice being to all, and any without difference dispensed.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Tros Tyriusve tibi nullo discrimine habetur.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is now testified in the present <hi>Connaght Court of Claymes</hi> under your Government the <hi>Irish</hi> in that Province, having therein their help, as had before the other parts of the Kingdom their distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Lands in former Courts of like nature. In which those of <hi>Connaght</hi> having been post-poned, they were given over as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediless, until by his gracious Majesties continual care of his People they were thus considered, and that by your Lordships procurement and management.</p>
            <p>God multiply his blessings on you in your Person, and in your Excellent Lady, and Noble Progeny; and make us happy in the continuance of your prosperous Government, generally desired; which are the prayers of</p>

            <p>THat between the first and second coming of Christ the Church being settled and propagated by the Apostles and their Successors, there should arise a certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son notoriously wicked, an adversary to Christ, and a cruel persecutor of the Church, whom the Scripture 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. and 4. calls <hi>Antichrist,</hi> is by Scripture and Apostolical Tradition among Catholicks most certain, and not to be doubted, <hi>Say the Romanists</hi>

               <hi>Which as first was intended but for that Honourable Auditory and place only where it was preached, but by multiplied importunities of many, and being awakened by an imperfect Copy, taken while it was in speaking, which I understood to have been dispersed, and I know not how far, and might be (I feared) to the prejudice of the Truth, and to the advantage of adversaries, I therefore consented to the revising and publishing thereof for avoiding those inconveniencies, declaring this, and none other, to be what I own.</hi>

               <p>And if <hi>Rome</hi> be the City for that malignant state, then must the Temple of God be understood to be there, and <hi>Rome</hi> to be the place for <hi>Antichrist's sitting.</hi> But it is objected, how the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> should be then called the Temple of God where <hi>Antichrist sitteth.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Of which 7 Governments of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is said that 5 <hi>are fallen,</hi> and <hi>one is,</hi> and <hi>the other not yet come; and that when he cometh, he must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a short space, and that the beast that was, and is not, and yet is, which</hi> is added (v. 8.) <hi>even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition</hi> v. 10.11.</p>
               <p>For opening both which Texts together,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is granted, that <hi>Rome is that great City seated on seven hills</hi> and <hi>ruling over the Kings of the earth.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. That <hi>these seven heads or governments, are</hi> Romes <hi>seven Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments also.</hi>

               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="1">1. What kind of Government this is, and how distinct or differing from the former.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That for introducing this seventh form of Government, the last foregoing, the sixth, was to be removed; and was removed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That on the removing of the sixth, this seventh succeded.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>And that Antichrist's dominion in <hi>Rome</hi> should be such, is imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>his sitting</hi> (that is <hi>in-chief) in the Temple of God, the Temple of God</hi> denoting as the <hi>place,</hi> so the <hi>person</hi> also as to his <hi>condition</hi> and <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> that he should be <hi>Clerical.</hi> He <hi>shall attain Ecclesiastical dignities, and in the Temple of God shall he sit, holding there the seat or chair of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency,</hi> saith <hi>Radulphus Flaviacensis de Antichristo</hi> (Levit. c. 1.) <hi>apud Magdeburg.</hi> (<hi>Cent.</hi> 10. c. 4.)

               <p>Of <hi>which</hi> Romes <hi>Pontificality,</hi> it is said (<hi>Rev,</hi> 17.8, 11.) that <hi>it was and is not, and yet is,</hi> and that <hi>being an eighth, it should yet be of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,</hi> that is,</p>

               <p>For as to matters referring to <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> had of old, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by <hi>Numa Pompilius, their Pontifices</hi> or Under-priests; and <hi>over them</hi> a <hi>chief Priest</hi> called (<hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi>) which <hi>lower Priests were

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Of <hi>this Roman Pontificality which was</hi> of old under the first five Governments; It is said also, <hi>that it is not:</hi> (<hi>Rev.</hi> 17.8.) <hi>i. e. then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the sixth Government,</hi> that of <hi>Caesars</hi> (which was that in Being when that was declared to St. <hi>John</hi>) then was it said that <hi>this is not,</hi> or <hi>then it was not</hi>; for the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour <hi>conceiving the Priviledges of the</hi> Pontifex Maximus <hi>overgreat, and not safe in any hand but his own, it being independent</hi>: therefore he <hi>assumed and annexed it to the Imperial Crown</hi>; so as it became one of the <hi>Imperial Titles,</hi> to be <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> thus continuing untill it was by <hi>Gratian a Christian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror altogether abolished</hi>; so as <hi>that office of Pontifex Maximus</hi> which was under the 6. Government was changed from what it was at first by <hi>Numa Pompilius, Swallowed up</hi> in the person of the Emperour, and after <hi>quite abolished,</hi> therefore <hi>that which was, now is not,</hi> or <hi>then was not,</hi> when that was by St. <hi>John</hi> written.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet is it added (<hi>Rev.</hi> 17.8.) that what was, <hi>and is not, and Yet is,</hi> there the present is for the future, as is usual in speaking of things to be, <hi>It is, i. e.</hi> it shall be again, or as now to us, it may be said <hi>that it is: being</hi> in the <hi>Romish Pontificate restored</hi>; not as <hi>before</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>it was an honorable office among the first</hi> 5. <hi>Governments</hi>; they were supream, under which this was, although independent. Nor is it now as it was after under the 6th <hi>Government,</hi> that of <hi>Caesars:</hi> it having been <hi>then annexed to the Imperial Crown</hi>; but <hi>now in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Pontificate,</hi> this <hi>that was,</hi> and <hi>after was not, now is,</hi> being <hi>restored and created supream, where we find even the very Title of</hi> Pontifex Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus <hi>retain'd,</hi> and the <hi>priviledges also, which the</hi> Pontifices, or <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priests, had of old, now again to them reserved; they being, as much as may be, exempted from civil power,</hi> and <hi>only accountable to him the now</hi> Pontifex maximus, <hi>and he himself to none other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It followeth to see, <hi>how this becomes an eighth head in that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, yet but of the seventh</hi> (<hi>Rev.</hi> 17.11.) That is so by the Pope's <hi>advancing his spiritual</hi> dominion <hi>and title above all Powers, the</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>not excepted,</hi> and <hi>being in his spiritual capacity the seventh,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>now in that exalted Power an eighth,</hi> the <hi>Priesthood the seventh,</hi> being in <hi>his exalted Power raised to an eighth head,</hi> yet of <hi>the seventh,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:63582:13"/>
being in <hi>his exalted Power raised to an eighth head,</hi> yet of <hi>the seventh</hi> notwithstanding; <hi>as to nature and kind</hi> this is the seventh, but an eighth, also <hi>in degree and power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to <hi>the introducing this seventh head in the Government of</hi> Rome, was <hi>the last foregoing</hi> (<hi>the sixth that of</hi> Caesars) to <hi>give place, and to be first taken out of the way,</hi> This is next to be considered, see it so in the text (v. 5, 6, 7, 8.) which now come in.</p>
               <p>This required wary expressions, not thereby to raise persecutions to the Christians from the Emperor; that being a <hi>crime Laesae Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestatis.</hi> This the Jews objected to Christ. <hi>John</hi> the 18. 12, 15. and to his <hi>Apostles.</hi> (<hi>Acts.</hi> 17.7.25.8.) Therefore we find the Apostle here very circumspect in declaring himself in it, not speaking all, but referring to what he had before told them in the ear, <hi>Remember ye not what I told you of these things when I was yet with you?</hi> (2. <hi>Thess:</hi> 2.5.) and being now to <hi>write</hi> of the same thing, how darkly is that done? <hi>not nameing Emperour</hi> or any thing that way, only <hi>when he that now letteth shall be taken out of the way,</hi> which indeed was the <hi>Emperour,</hi> by whom that former office of <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> was taken out of the way, and the Emperour also being likely to oppose any other over topping power in that kind; Therefore in <hi>order to Romes</hi> 7th. <hi>head or Government was the sixth to be removed,</hi> and that it was so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we find it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In <hi>Constantine the</hi> Great, (the first Christian Emperour) <hi>his changing the seat of the</hi> Empire, which was <hi>Rome</hi> Anciently, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving to Constantinople; thereby leaving <hi>the City of Rome,</hi> as it were vacant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When by succeding Emperours the Roman Empire was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the Roman Eagle before under one head, having after 2 heads: and spred into Eastern and Western Empires, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the seat of the Western Empire was other where than at <hi>Rome,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by was that place left to the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> in a yet farther degree than before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But yet more, when <hi>ann.</hi> 475. the Western Empire had quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, and indeed in <hi>Augustulus</hi> (as it began in <hi>Augustus</hi>) the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire having bin invaded by the <hi>Goths</hi> and other Barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by whom also <hi>Rome</hi> it self was taken, and possessed about 50
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63582:14"/>
years, the <hi>Pope</hi> himself being also expelled and put to seek, for a time, another habitation, Hereby was the Western Empire determined, and so continued 325 years.</p>
               <p>This was the 2. <hi>head</hi> proposed, the first <hi>removeing him that did let, for makeing way for him that was to succeed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. It follows to shew the others succeeding accordingly, and that gradually comeing on according to the steps of the former's receding.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For on <hi>Constantines leaving Rome,</hi> and <hi>makeing Constantinople the seat of his</hi> Empire <hi>thereby</hi> (Sede vacante) <hi>the. Bishop of Rome</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on the <hi>possession of the City of Rome</hi>; (the Romanists add): by <hi>donation from Constantine,</hi> with addition of other large Territories, held in Fee, and in Demeasn for ever. This I pass; it not being my work at present to examine it. In this state things stood about 300 years, <hi>Romes</hi> Goverment being in that time by its Bishops, yet subjected to the Emperor, by which they were kept within their bounds, for <hi>Rome</hi> being but one of the 5 Patriarchs, although chief among them, was not yet above them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So continued it untill <hi>the Empire determined</hi> in <hi>Augustulus, an.</hi> 475. after which <hi>An.</hi> 607. <hi>Boniface.</hi> 3. obtained from <hi>Phocas</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the East, that <hi>not the Patriarch of Constantinople</hi> (who contended for being Chief) <hi>but the Bishop of Rome</hi> should <hi>be universal Bishop. This Gregory.</hi> 1. Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had before condemned in <hi>John Patriarch of Constantinople,</hi> and by his but attempting it, <hi>concluded him, or any so doing,</hi> to be <hi>Antichrist or his forerunner,</hi> and <hi>that Antichrist himself was not farr off.</hi> And <hi>now was the Title of Pope appropriated to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome,</hi> which was before communicated to other Patriarchs, and Bishops also indifferently.</p>
               <p>And hitherto <hi>reached Romes Episcopal</hi> and <hi>Patriarchal Government,</hi> of which it was said that it should <hi>continue a short space, Rev.</hi> 7.10. which was about 300 years, that being but short compared with what followed from <hi>Boniface</hi> 3. when the <hi>Title began to swell to its greatness, they</hi> being thenceforth <hi>Vniversal Bishops, and Popes above</hi> all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But after <hi>Boniface</hi> 3. <hi>Pope Leo.</hi> 3. <hi>an,</hi> 800. made a farther <hi>Essay
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63582:14"/>
of his power,</hi> in <hi>deposing</hi> the <hi>Lawful King of France,</hi> and advancing <hi>Pipin</hi> his Subject to be King, and after <hi>created Charlemaine Emperor</hi>; both as Champions for the Church, to Expell the Barbarians. who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded <hi>Italy,</hi> out of whose hands <hi>Rome</hi> was recovered, and restored to the Pope, with addition of other large Territories.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But all this while, the Popes power, was in some things restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by those Emperours of their own making, who <hi>reserved to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the choosing</hi> and <hi>placeing of Bishops,</hi> and the approbation even of the very <hi>Popes</hi> also.</p>
               <p>In this, <hi>Gregory</hi> 7th. contended with <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. Emperour, whom he Excommunicated and Deposed, stirring up against him his subject <hi>Rodulphus,</hi> naming him Emperour, and giving the Crown, with PETRA DEDIT PETRO, PETRUS DIADEMA RODULPHO.</p>
               <p>Of the troubles, bloud, and destruction to <hi>Germany</hi> in that, I speak not, onely that to this <hi>Gregory</hi> 7. is by <hi>Popish</hi> writers that glory given, that he was <hi>Imperii Pontificii fundator</hi>; others his Predecessors attempted the reaching at the temporal power, but was not till now attained.</p>
               <p>And after, the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> 5th. coming to <hi>Rome</hi> to be Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Pope <hi>Paschalis</hi> 2d. the Pope would not consent to his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he <hi>first did give over all Right of Election</hi> of Popes, and of <hi>Investitures of Bishops by Staffe and Ring</hi>; In which although that Pope failed then of his end, yet was that after attained.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And although, In all this the Pope had gained the point of <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral sovereignty,</hi> and the gaining also out of <hi>temporal hands</hi> into the <hi>Popes power,</hi> the <hi>Investitures of Bishops,</hi> by which he was in that kind absolute, yet could not that satisfie, while the Pope was over-topped by a <hi>General Council,</hi> By which he had been oft threatned, awed and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deposed.</p>
               <p>The removing this therefore, was to be next attempted, and was at length also by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> 1Oth. compassed, so far as the Popes Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Lateran</hi> could do towards it; of which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thus Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly; <hi>The last Lateran Council under</hi> Leo 10. <hi>expresly and professedly teacheth that the Pope is above all Councils, and reproveth a contrary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree in the Council of</hi> Basil, (<hi>citeing the words of the Council,</hi> to which he adds) <hi>To this nothing can be answered, unless it be that this was no
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63582:15"/>
General Council, or that it was not received by the Church, or that this was not their decree de fide.</hi> Belarm. de concil. l. 2 c. 17.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But <hi>one thing yet remained</hi> (shewing, as the Popes power, so his being in that, very <hi>Antichrist</hi>) which is the <hi>confirming those Romish erroneus positions</hi> which had been long creeeping into the Church, as <hi>Tares mixed with the Wheat:</hi> and had long passed loose, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined, being onely disputable, controverted, and oft oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
               <p>These were after, in the Councils of <hi>Constance, Lateran,</hi> and of <hi>Trent,</hi> concluded and decreed for <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and <hi>Articles of Faith</hi>; and an <hi>Additional Creed of</hi> 12 <hi>Articles of them composed,</hi> which were by <hi>Pius</hi> 4th. his Bull imposed to be subscribed or sworn unto.</p>
               <p>In all see,</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. See also <hi>the introduceing and growing up of the</hi> 7th. from its <hi>infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> to its <hi>full growth</hi>; The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> being before, but as <hi>others, a Branch onely of the</hi> Catholick Church, <hi>now it self passing for The</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, and <hi>she</hi> the <hi>root</hi> out of which all other Churches derive and spring, others on this <hi>depending,</hi> and by that <hi>influenced</hi>: so doth that Church now boast of her self, of which the <hi>Apostle</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to that Church had forwarned them, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.18, 19, 20.) <hi>Boast not against the Branches, but if thou boast thou bearest not the root, but the root thee; Thou wilt say, the branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in; well, because of Vnbelief they were broken off, and thou stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est by Faith, be not high-minded but fear, For if God spared not the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral branches, take heed that he also spare not thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which is the Apostles prophecy concerning that Church.</p>
               <p>But before this be shut up, one doubt is to be removed, <hi>of the Empire being not yet taken out of the way,</hi> which we now see in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Res. 1. Of that Empire which was in the Apostles dayes, is that by the Apostle intended, that it should be first taken out of the way, the standing of that being an hinderance to the Succeeding Government. But that Empire was long since extinguished.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:63582:15"/>2. The present Empire is of another kind, being of the Popes own erection, for restoring, promoting and preserving his greatness; His hand being in that thoughout.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Bellarmine</hi> writing of <hi>the Translation of the Roman Empire</hi> in 3 bookes, he makes the summe of <hi>his first book,</hi> The <hi>Roman Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by authority of the</hi> Pope, <hi>translated from the</hi> Graecians <hi>to the</hi> French.

               <p>And therein we find that fulfilled which was prophesied of <hi>this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Beast</hi> (the Papacy) <hi>Its setting up an Image of the former beast which had a wound by a Sword, that it should live, speak and be worshipped</hi> (Rev. 13. 12, 14, 15.)

               <p>Neither insist I on those <hi>wonders</hi> by these acted, whether <hi>seeming real by Satans working</hi> with them or for them; or that they be <hi>lying wonders,</hi> whether <hi>feigned,</hi> or imposed as true; or <hi>lying, serving for confirming lyes</hi> and untrue doctrines of men; nor speak I of those <hi>ridiculous fables, with which their Legends of Saints are stuffed,</hi> such as may be wondred how learned and prudent men should give credit to them (if they do.)

               <p>But I look on this here rather <hi>as a sign, and mark of Antichrist</hi> by which he should act, and be known in the World, his <hi>Antichristian Church boasting of wonders, making miracles a sign of the true Church, and upbraiding us</hi> with <hi>our want</hi> (they say) of <hi>Miracles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which we say. 1, That <hi>for the first introducing of truth, miracles might be necessary,</hi> but that truth being once received, such miracles were after unnecessary; such were in the <hi>first planting of the Gospel, done by Christ and his Apostles, which we challenge as ours.</hi> But that <hi>truth then delivered to the saints</hi> being received and believed, what now need we more, or any renewed miracles? For, <hi>miracles and wonders,</hi> as tongues, &amp;c. <hi>are for unbelievers, not for them that believe,</hi> (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.22. and it shews a <hi>novelty in those Popish Doctrines,</hi> that need fresh confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and shewes them <hi>unbelievers</hi> that seek such.

As to the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the Lords Supper, our Lord gave the bread broken, a sign of his body broken, and after that the <hi>cup</hi>; the <hi>wine poured out</hi> being his bloud in his death shed for us, <hi>commanding so to do till his coming again</hi>: and as to the <hi>Cup</hi> particularly (foreseeing what would be after by opposers to the contrary) our Lord added in that ministration, <hi>Drink ye all of this</hi> (Math. 26.27.) it being said, that accordingly, <hi>they did all drink of it,</hi> (Mark 14.23.) which, <hi>all to drink;</hi> and <hi>all drinking,</hi> is in the <hi>wine expressed</hi>; and implyed onely in the <hi>bread.</hi> Which Institution and command of Christ our Lord in that, being his <hi>will and testament</hi> left to his Church, is to <hi>be as his last will, observed</hi> to the last, and ought not to be changed in the least, no, <hi>although it had been but mans Testament</hi> onely (Gal. 3.5.) yet <hi>see Christ in that by Antichrist opposed, Take the Bread,</hi> and <hi>also the Cup</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>not so</hi> saith the Pope, <hi>the Cup may be spared</hi>; for Christs <hi>bloud is in his Body by concomitancy</hi>; and taking his Body, ye have by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence his Bloud: But here it is understood that <hi>his Body is given broken,</hi> and his <hi>Bloud shed,</hi> both setting forth the <hi>Lords death,</hi> and not otherwise; which <hi>countermand</hi> to Christs <hi>command</hi> in that, is with a <hi>non obstante; licet —. Although that Christ and the primitive Church did administer the Sacrament in both Kinds; notwithstanding, is this custom of but one Kind to be held for a law unreproveable.</hi> (so is it ordered in the Council of <hi>Constance.</hi> Sess. 13.) and the <hi>Council of</hi> Trent <hi>after; This Synod being taught by the Holy Ghost; and the custom and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church doth declare and teach that the Laiety and Clergie not celebrating, are not obliged to take the Sacrament of the</hi> Eucharist <hi>under both Kinds, notwithstanding that Christ did institute this Sacrament under both Kinds, and so gave it to his Apostles</hi> (Concil.

                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:63582:20"/>1.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>
                  <hi>Vergerius</hi> also, well acquainted with the method and actings of the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> speaks of <hi>one hundred and fifty thousand</hi> in less than 30 years so suffering.</p>
               <p>And from the first rising of the <hi>Jesuites,</hi> to the year 1580, about 30 years, are about <hi>fourscore and ten thousand</hi> Protestants said to have been destroyed.</p>

               <p>And can the <hi>bloudy butcheries of poor Protestants by the cruel</hi> Irish <hi>in</hi> Ireland be in this forgotten, when about <hi>one hundred thousand</hi> perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>anno</hi> 1641? yet to that Impudence is that now risen, as to disavow any such Rebellion of the <hi>Irish, or such their murders of the innocent Protestants in</hi> Ireland; <hi>but daring to averr on the contrary, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were the sufferers, and that by the</hi> English <hi>and Protestants</hi>: Of which, if there shall be opportunity offered by an answer to this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which is expected, this shall be then verified to the World.</p>
               <p>And if the <hi>Invasion, anno.</hi> 1588. or the <hi>horrid Gunpowder-Treason, Nov.</hi> 5. 1605. had taken effect, more of their cruelty would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:63582:21"/>Such is that <hi>Antichristian cruelty</hi>; and that yet worse, in its being grounded on their very <hi>Doctrine, Religion, and Faith</hi>; they being taught, that they ought so to do: thereby <hi>thinking that they do God service</hi> (John 16.2.) and <hi>that to themselves also,</hi> in so acting <hi>Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which <hi>Bloud-thirsty cruelty against the Worshippers of Christ,</hi> sticks as <hi>a distinguishing mark of this Romish and Babylonian Antichrist, in being drunk with the bloud of the Saints, and Martyrs of Jesus.</hi> Which is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to those alone, not to be found in any other party of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World beside.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Add that <hi>the being a man of sin,</hi> is as it were fixed to <hi>the very Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy it self, so as even its very Office, incapacitates to Goodness.</hi> They cannot do good if they would, in reforming what they are convinced is evil.</p>

His Oration to the Pope to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is extant.</p>
               <p>On which, <hi>Pope Adrian</hi> discoursing after, privately, with <hi>William Excourt,</hi> whom he after created Cardinal; and <hi>Theodorick Hesius,</hi> his familiar and trusty Friend, said, <hi>That the condition of Popes was misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, seeing it was plain that they could not do good, though they desired and endeavoured to do it.</hi>

Urbis l. 6. in Julio 3.)</p>
               <p>To which add what Sir <hi>Edwin Sands</hi> observes of a Proverb in <hi>Italy,</hi> (and proverbs founded on observation, have a strange tendency to truth) That <hi>of the</hi> Italians, <hi>the</hi> Romans <hi>are the worst Christians; of the</hi> Romans <hi>the worst are made Priests, of the Priests the worst chosen Cardinals, and of Cardinals the worst commonly elected</hi> Popes.

               </p>
               <p>The summe of all is,</p>
               <p n="1">I. That what that <hi>great</hi> City <hi>Babylon</hi> of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> was, as to <hi>oppression</hi> and <hi>cruelty,</hi> to Gods people of old (<hi>Jer.</hi> 51.34, 35.) That should be to the Christian Church, another <hi>great City</hi> called also <hi>in a Mystery</hi> Babylon <hi>the mother of the Abominations of the Earth, drunk with the Bloud of the Saints and Martyrs of Jesus.</hi> (Rev. 17.5, 6.)</p>
               <p n="2">II. That <hi>this great</hi> City Babylon, described <hi>a woman sitting on 7 moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and reigning over the Kings of the Earth</hi> (Rev. 17.9, 18.) is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be <hi>Rome.</hi> They therefore who send us to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or <hi>Constantinople</hi> for the <hi>place,</hi> put us out of the way in that enquiry.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That in <hi>Rome,</hi> should sit one, <hi>by whom (after the Faith there settled)</hi> the <hi>inhabitants of the earth should be seduced,</hi> and <hi>drawn into dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Heresies:</hi> and that he the authour of those miseries and mischief<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to the Church, should be <hi>a man of sin</hi> commonly called <hi>Antichrist.</hi> This the <hi>Romanists</hi> themselves acknowledge.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That in so doing, this <hi>Antichrist</hi> should <hi>sit in the Temple of God,</hi> as being <hi>of the Church,</hi> and <hi>over the Church in chief, pretending for Christ,</hi> he the while <hi>acting against Christ.</hi> A seeming friend, but secret enemy; a secret, not an open, declared and professed enemy to Christ and his followers. Therefore cannot this be the <hi>Turk,</hi> or any such.</p>
               <p n="5">V. That this Antichrist, <hi>sitting in the Temple of God,</hi> should be in the capacity of a <hi>seventh head of the Government of</hi> Rome, <hi>next succeeding</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:63582:22"/>
the sixth head or Government there, (<hi>that of</hi> Caesars) This brings it home to the <hi>Papacy,</hi> That and none other <hi>being the</hi> 7<hi>th.</hi> and that also long since on the Emperours removal setled. Vain therefore are alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations for any others being this Antichrist, not being of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor there so qualified.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. That the Pope sitteth in the <hi>Temple of God, as God, shewing himself there as God, and exalted above all that is called God, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. Here is to be added what is (in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.3, 4.) said of <hi>that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that great City,</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi>: That she did sit on a <hi>scarlet colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Beast: and <hi>that she (the woman) was</hi> arrayed in purple and scarlet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and decked with Gold. In which she is described as to her very <hi>Habit</hi>; the <hi>proper attire both of Popes and Cardinals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Nor is to be omitted; what is (<hi>Rev.</hi> 17.5.) said in a way of further description of that <hi>woman</hi>; that <hi>upon her forehead was</hi> a name <hi>written,</hi> Mystery, <hi>Babylon</hi> the great, the mother of harlots, and Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the Earth. Concerning which is <hi>observed,</hi> that as the <hi>High Priest</hi> under the Law, had in the Front <hi>his Miter engraven,</hi> HOLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS TO THE LORD (<hi>Exod.</hi> 29.36, 37.) So the <hi>summus Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fex,</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> had also in his <hi>Tiara,</hi> that name, <hi>Mystery.</hi> Which having been observed and objected by King <hi>James</hi> of blessed memory, in that his Excellent Work on the <hi>Revelation, Lessius,</hi> his Antagonist, denies it not, but labours to put it off slidingly: nor could it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, there being many <hi>Eye-witnesses</hi> to averre it <hi>Down. de Antichr. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 7. which his <hi>name</hi> of <hi>mystery,</hi> well agrees with that <hi>mystery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> by which his evil and secret workings are described, (2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.7.) one (not unlikely) referring to the other. But from God it is (sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) <hi>providentially,</hi> that that word <hi>mystery</hi> should so be seen <hi>in the whores forehead, shewing who she is</hi>; notwithstanding that they who contrived it, might have had other ends in it; as that the <hi>Popes Triple Crown,</hi> pointed to that <hi>mystery</hi> of his <hi>Triple power and dominion</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and in <hi>Earth,</hi> and in <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So as in the <hi>Papacy</hi> concur all these <hi>Scripture-marks of Antichrist,</hi> And although some may be applicable otherwise, yet are the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal proper to the Pope alone; and taken altogether, not meeting in any other but in the <hi>Pope</hi> only. Therefore on the whole, who would
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63582:22"/>
not conclude <hi>the Popes being Antichrist; the man of sin; and son of Perdition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. By which last, His being said to be a <hi>Son of perdition,</hi> I am brought from Antichrists Rise, to <hi>the last consideration</hi> here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, <hi>Antichrists down fall,</hi> which follows on the other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily; for if he <hi>be a man of sin,</hi> he must <hi>be a son of perdition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this his fall it is here said,<hi>that the Lord shall consume him with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy him with the brightness of his come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (v. 8.) <hi>that they all might be damned who believe not the truth.</hi> (v. 12.) where is distruction

That <hi>he consumed by the breath of the Lords mouth</hi>; The <hi>breath of the Lords mouth</hi> is the <hi>preaching of the Gospel</hi> which is <hi>the word of God</hi> so Generally interpreted; And to be <hi>consumed</hi> implyes a <hi>lingring wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away,</hi> and by degrees wasting, and decaying; not a violent and suddain destruction, such as was <hi>Simon-Magus his down-fall,</hi> said to have been <hi>on St. Peters breath</hi> or prayers against him.</p>
               <p>Of this Consumption <hi>of the Papal</hi> power and greatness by the <hi>preaching of the word and Gospel in the world,</hi> we have apparent evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

               <p>
                  <hi>Since that time when ye</hi> (Protestants) <hi>say the Pope began to be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, the Papal Empire was so far from increasing, that thenceforth it every day more and more declined, And (as you would have it) Antichrist reigning, the Roman See hath by little and little decayed, it having lost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all Africa, a great part of Asia: all Greece and even in our very days a great part of Germany, Sweden, Gothland, Norwey, and all Denmark, A good part of England, France, Helvetia, Poland, Bohemia, and part of Hungary are fallen away.</hi> (Bellarm: de Rom: Pontif. l. 3. c. 21.) This way by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> written <hi>an.</hi> 1577, as appears in the Preface to

that work, so as that decay in the Papal Empire was then within the space of 60 <hi>years,</hi> accounting from the year 1517, the time of <hi>Luthers</hi> Preaching (of which he speaks) <hi>declaring the Pope to be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi>: What then may be the <hi>consumption</hi> and decay there at this time, being 150 <hi>years since?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>See this <hi>Rev.</hi> 17, where the <hi>ten horns</hi> of that <hi>scarlet coloured beast, on which that woman</hi> Rome <hi>sitteth,</hi> are expounded, <hi>ten Kings</hi> which had <hi>not then received their Kingdom, but were to receive power as Kings one hour with the Beast</hi> (v. 12.)

               <p n="1">1. That there was a time when Antichristianism was a <hi>mystery,</hi> not understood, Antichrist not being yet so declared as after.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And that after Antichrist was pointed at in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet while erroneous doctrines there were but disputable, not imposed, as after in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> to be <hi>de fide,</hi> with an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi> to such as thought of them otherwise, and to such as did not understand the reach and depth of those evils; and where the light of the Gospel is shut out, as in some places, and the knowledge of that denied, and persecuted. For these, <hi>is our charity grounded,</hi> to say well of them, as of those of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> who had not known the depths of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, as they speak</hi> (<hi>Rev</hi> 2.24.) and those of <hi>Pergamus, dwelling even where Satan</hi>'s <hi>seat is</hi>; yet (saith our Lord) <hi>thou hast held fast my name, and hast not denied my Faith, even in those dayes wherein</hi> Antipas <hi>my faithful Martyr was slain among them where Satan dwelleth</hi> (v. 12.) To be among <hi>Hereticks, and not to believe Hereticks,</hi> or not being led by them, is St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s distinction in that case; such ignorance may excuse.</p>
               <p>But as to ignorance affected, having Light, and means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and when called on to come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> its ruine being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and communion there declared perillous; To such we say, that their continuing so in that state, is hazardous and full of danger: Nor can such rely on ignorance, it not in that case excusing. For in <hi>this is condemnation, where light is come; and men love darkness rather than light</hi> (<hi>John</hi> 3.19.) and where the <hi>leaders of the People cause to err, they that are led of them are destroyed</hi> (<hi>Is.</hi> 9.16.) and <hi>the blind by them so led; both fall into the Ditch.</hi> (<hi>Math.</hi> 15.14.)</p>
               <p n="4">4. But as to those <hi>who are knowing</hi> and who <hi>defend and plead for Baal, seducing, and being seduced,</hi> and <hi>so continuing,</hi> the state of such is declared <hi>damnable; that they all may be damned, saith the</hi> Text who <hi>believe not the truth but have pleasure in unrighteousness</hi> (v. 12.) and to such belongs that evil by the Angel declared, <hi>if any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his Mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the Wine of the wrath of God, which is pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out without mixture into the Cup of his indignation, and he shall be

tormented</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.9, 11. let such consider their State seriously and seasonably.</p>
               <p>And now to conclude with a word <hi>to our selves,</hi> that as <hi>we are to bless God for calling us out of that Sate of evil,</hi> so to be <hi>confirmed in the truth,</hi> and not to <hi>fall back,</hi> whatever <hi>the Temptation be, good, or evil, saving life, or loosing it</hi>; and that we desire <hi>the Lords grace in that for help and support.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which I shall shut up in the words of the Apostle, next after my Text (v. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.) <hi>We are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the truth whereunto he hath called you by our Gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ: Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word or by our Epistle: Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God even our Father, who hath loved us, and given us everlasting consolation, and good hope through Grace, comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work:</hi> Amen.</p>
