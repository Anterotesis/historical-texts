         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

answered, Because I know the euil that thou
shalt doe to the children of Israel: for their strong
Cities shalt thou set on fire, and their young men
shalt thou slaie with the sword, and shalt dash their
Infants against the stones, and rent in peeces their

euen wounded our soules, wherin we see nothing
but traces of blood, and (as it were) the blacke face,
and countenance of confused desolation.</p>
            <p>King, Queene, Prince, with all their Royall issue,

we felt (to our wofull experience) how speedily, the

bene heard, but rumbling of shot, and chrashing of

nothing seen but sacking of cities, burning of towns,

as all this were nothing, or not enough, we should
haue seene these miscreants, neuer sated with the

his Pill of poyson, intended against Queene <hi>Eliza:</hi>
of famous memory, by their owne confession, the

The old worthy Romanes the two <hi>Decij,</hi> thought
it the most heroicall thing that might bee, to vowe
themselues to death for their Country, and euen to
spend their liues in defence of their Altars, Temples,
and Monuments, of their Elders, but you seeke to
see your Countrey bathing in the bloud of your
Prince, Peeres, and Prophets, in the bloud of your
parents, kindred, and friends, to see the cities, graues,
and temples, of your predecessors, consumed with
fire: to see your Records burned, your Actuaries
destroyed, your virgins deflowred, your women ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished,
and finally, to bring the noblest of Nations
to a perpetuall slauery, and seruitude, by as deadly

            <p>Surely, surely, for this your entended mischiefe,

with whose bloud you haue embrewed your tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous

            <p>O vnkinde Countrymen, and cruell Caitiffes, I

I haue bene your wealth and shadow in a florishing

Empire, but you are now my want and woe: in a
decaying estate, I haue preserued your wiues to
your comfort, and your children to your great ioy,
but ye haue made my wife husbandlesse, and my
children fatherlesse, to their vnspeakable griefe, I
cloathed you with scarlet, and hanged ornaments
of gold vpon your apparell, spotted with the purest
Armines, but you haue couered my dead corpes
with a Carpet of greene grasse, diaperd with my
dearest bloud. Finally, I haue kept your Daggers
within your sheathes, and you haue sheathed them
within my heart: Fie, fie: Flee, flee: And whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can you flee, but the Hagge will euer haunt
you? nor can you euer fare well, till the Fury, finde
you faultlesse. <hi>Interim nos ad sepulchra vadimus.</hi> We
sleepe in peace.</p>
            <p>The Lord deliuer our Church &amp; Country from
all such Brutish &amp; Cassian cruelties, so as neuer they
be able either to touch the Lords annointed, or do

            <p>Let this suffice for the danger deuised by men, but
vndone by God, and if any would know by what
men, and of what Religion) I answere, by English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and of the Popish Religion: Nor will I say that
all of that faction were priuie to the practise, yet may
I say, that none (for ought I yet heare) were of the

which when God hath the glorie, and the truth is

knowne, then will it appeare how farre the humour
hath spred it self into the bodie of all the kingdom,
too much (God wot) decaied with that deadly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie.</p>
            <p>Yet I hope well in time, if such be the fruits of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish

am perswaded that this is of the deepest die.</p>
            <p>For in stead of blowing vp vs, they haue blowne
vp themselues, &amp; their Religion, with such a wound
to their Cause, as will neuer be cured by any craft,
being blotted with one of the horriblest Treasons,
that euer was contriued, and such as God &amp; Nature

            <p>The old <hi>Florentines</hi> had a Bell, which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

            <p>Witnesseth <hi>Ely,</hi> his impunitie towards his children,

towardes them. He deemed it lesse sin to shew some
indulgence, but one saith well; <hi>Iustitia non nouit patre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

spare others, if they bee found guiltie in either of
both. <hi>Hierome</hi> is more peremptorie in a case of
like importance, When hee saith; <hi>Licet paruulus ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>collo

Vbera (quibus tenutriuit) mater ostendit, licet inlimine

vexillum crucis euola, solum pietatis genus est in hacre
esse crudelem, gladium tenet hostis, vt me perimat, &amp;
ego de matris lacrimis cogitabo? propter Patrem: Christi
militiam deseram? cui etiam sepulturam christi cause
non debeo,</hi> which I may English thus; Although
thy little Grandchild cling about thy necke, and say
spare father; Although the mother come forth, with
spred haire, and torne raiment, and shewe thee the
pappes: where once thou-sucked thy life, with her
loue, and say; spare sonne: Although the father cast
himselfe downe vpon thy threshold to keepe them,
tread vpon thy father, and with dry cheekes fly to
the execution of thy profession. It is an onely point
of godlines in this case to be cruel, and a soueraigne
Pittie, to be pittilesse: Shall the enemie hold vp his
hand to Wound the Church? and shall I think vpon
the teares of my mother? shal I because of my father,
cease to fight for my Christ? to whom I owe no bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall,
for the cause of my Christ, but am to leaue the
dead, to burie the dead: whilest I followe him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3771:14"/>
Whereupon I may wel say, that mercy may haue
it excesse, and pittie may be great crueltie: especially
then, when it ouerflow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>to the good mans danger:
mistake mee not, I like of loue, but when it is
tempred with feare, I like it better: I know it may do
much with the better sort, but not with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
according to that of <hi>Augustine, Meliores sunt quos
dirigit Amor, sed plures sunt quos corrigit timor.</hi> They
be better who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loue directeth, but they be moe, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
feare correcteth: and therfore the temper of both is
melodious in the eare of a sanctified &amp; setled estate.</p>
            <p>And so to draw towards an end, and at last to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
out of that which hath bene spoken, both of
former Popish cruelties, and out of our happie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance
from their last entended treasons, powde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with so many mischiefes: (I say) in caution of
future peril by me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that generation; Take heed of
Poperie, take heed of Papists, and tollerate neither
their cause nor person: for if you tollerate the cause,
it will infect the person: if you tollerate the person, it
will credit the cause: therefore to tollerate neither of
both, in a state so sanctified as ours is, I hold it safest.
What then is to be done, will some say, away with
both head, and taile: for Poperie kept vnder, will
practise treason: if it get aloft, it will play the tyrant:
therefore no way to haue it, is safest, and with least
danger.</p>
            <p>Further my aduise is, that you trust them as little as
you may, &amp; neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerse with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but for their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Againe, take heede of them, for they are busie

            <p>Beware of their blind guides, Iesuits, Seminaries,

tares of all treasons, at all times, and in all places; they
are the Frogs of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that leap into kings chambers,
&amp; busily possesse the Courts of Princes, &amp; mightie
men, either to poison their hearts with the enchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Cup of Romish superstition, or to bereaue them
of their liues: if they fashion not to their deuotions,
they leaue the Pulpits, they flye from the hornes of
the Altar, they disclaime the Oratories, and they
become men of estate, managing the Empire, and
marshalling the common-weale of Princes: so as I
may well say of these new Nouices, as was said of the
Monks of old.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quicquid agit Mundus, Monachus vult esse secundus;</hi>
Where euer the world is one, the Romish Cleargie
will be another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3771:15"/>
Lastly, beware of mixture, and shun the sinnes of
<hi>Samaria,</hi> who were a mixed people, and of a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Religion, tollerating both the persons and causes
of Idolatry: As you may reade in the 2. of <hi>Kings.</hi> 17.
vers. 24. for the persons. And vers. 23. for the cause.
And the Iewes in the daies of Christ, thought it as
greeuous an imputation as they could deuise,<note place="margin">Ioel. 8. 48.</note> to laie
vpon him, when they said, Say we not wel, that thou
arta Samaritan, and hast a diuel? And surely so it is,
for to be of two religions, is to be of no religion: and
to tollerate both, is to confound all, either in a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
or in a conscience.</p>
            <p>It is memorable, and it may goe for a Caution
to all Christian Kings and Princes, what is recorded
in this case, of the vnconscionable offer, of great
<hi>Chan,</hi> the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Prince, of whom <hi>Lipsius</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
that when <hi>Stephanus,</hi> that mightie King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was dead; he amongst others, sent his Legat to
the assembly where the new Creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was, with these
three motiues, to moue them to make him King.
1. First, that he was mightie, and could bring myri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads

defence or inlarging of their kingdome of <hi>Poland.</hi>
2 Secondly,<note place="margin">Lipsij mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita &amp; Exemp.</note> that he was frugall, &amp; could liue in time
of famine, onely with horse flesh. 3. Thirdly, for the
Religion, whereof he heard there was much dispute
among them,<note place="margin">Polit. 3. lib. 20. 11.</note> that he was indifferent, saying; <hi>Tuus
pontefex meus pontefex esto: tuus Lutherus meus Lutherus
esto.</hi> Your Pope, shall be my Pope: and your <hi>Luther,</hi>
shall be my <hi>Luther:</hi> It was the <hi>Tartarians</hi> sinne, to be
so indifferent, and so readily to offer a tollerance: and
<pb facs="tcp:3771:16"/>
it was the Polonians sinne, so long to suffer a
mixture of many or moe religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s then one in a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
And yet how euer, either feare or folly, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the Polonians for the time to endure it, and to
staine their kingdome and conscience, with so great
a brand of wickednes, (notwithstanding the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours

before God and his Angels, that I am so constant for the

as that I would spend my deerest blood in defence
thereof, Rather then the truth should bee ouer throwne:
And if I had ten times as many moe Kingdomes as I
haue, I would dispend them all, for the safetie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
thereof: And likewise, if I had any children,
that should yeelde either to the Popish faith or faction,
I desire of God, that I may rather see them brought to

in their families? It were a grieuous imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to either of both, and that which the aduersarie
himselfe would neuer yeelde vs, they will neither
tollerate vs nor ours, and why should wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
either them or theirs? If the euill will not
yeelde to the good, why should the good yeeld to
the euill?</p>
            <p>Doe but mention a tolleration of Religion in
<hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> will be ragious: doe but speake of
such a thing in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and it will be thought prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.
<hi>France</hi> is fearefull in deliuering it Edicts, and
whole <hi>Italy</hi> is resolute neuer to yeelde either to
our cause or persons. Why should wee then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
either them or theirs in their knowne Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie?</p>
            <p>Were the Law of God on foote,<note place="margin">Deut. 13. 9.</note> that Idolaters
should die the death, soone would the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
be determined, and motions for tollerations in
Christian common-wealthes, would seldome bee
mentioned: but whilest we demurre vpon the point,

whether <hi>Rome</hi> bee <hi>Babilon,</hi> the Pope Antichrist, his
Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> antichristia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; whether his louers &amp; friends
be enemies to the state, and dangerous to a Kingly
rule, (I say) whilest we demurre vpon such doubts,
and are a debating the Question, Poperie will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease;
and presume to gaine, if not an alteration, yet
a tolleration: If not a tolleration, yet a connivence:
<pb facs="tcp:3771:17"/>
and if not that, yet such a personall respect, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of some, as will endanger the state of all, if wee
endure it any longer.</p>
            <p>By the lawe of God, the Idolater (I say againe)
must die the death. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 20. And if an Israelite
will goe in and dally with a <hi>Midianite</hi> before <hi>Moses,</hi>
and in the sight of all the congregation: zealous <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nehas,</hi>
with his speare in his hand, may enter the
Tent, and thrust them through, that the plague may
cease from Israel. <hi>Numbers.</hi> 25. 6.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath sworne that hee will warre with
<hi>Amaleck,</hi> from generation to generation. <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.
And amongst other ordinances laid down by God
for his people, this was vrged againe to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
thus. When the Lord hath giuen thee rest from
all thine enemies, and the land for an Inheritance to
possesse it, then shalt thou put out the remembrance
of <hi>Amaleck</hi> from vnder heauen, forget it not. <hi>Deut.</hi>

            <p>And 400. yeares after <hi>Saule</hi> was plagued for spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

            <p>The Lord (I can assure you) requireth a through
conuersion from sin: And why not a through sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
of sinne? The Tabernacle of God hath it
Censer, Snuffers, &amp; Beesome, to purge the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
&amp; sweepe away the filth: &amp; if you build, the rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish
