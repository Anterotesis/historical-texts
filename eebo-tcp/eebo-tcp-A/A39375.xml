            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A VINDICATION OF THE DOCTRINE Concerning the <hi>Light Within,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Deſire that <hi>G. Keith,</hi> for his own Souls ſake, would give me ſome Publick Satisfaction, for the Publick Injury he has done me, in endeavouring to make the World believe, that I am one of that ſort of Men, who call themſelves <hi>Deiſts.</hi> It is my Reſolution by the Grace of GOD, to ſhew <hi>All Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to</hi> G. K. and to <hi>All Men.</hi> But I wou'd have it obſerv'd, that it is not inconſiſtent with <hi>Chriſtian Meekneſs,</hi> to expreſs our ſelves with the greateſt Severity in our <hi>Authoritative</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on any thing moſt groſly and notoriouſly <hi>Impious.</hi> I ſhall ſay no more to induce the Candid Reader to ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects towards Me, as are requiſite for a due Reception of what I ſhall here deliver in Defence of that moſt important Truth, which <hi>G. K.</hi> p. 3. plainly declares that he hath <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, viz.</hi> that
<q>The Inward Evidence of the Spirit, as touching the great Matters of the Chriſtian Faith, is the PRIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIPAL Rule of Faith, and Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:66454:3"/>By the Inward Evidence of the Spirit I underſtand, that TRUTH, which <hi>the Spirit of</hi> TRUTH has <hi>Written in the Hearts of</hi> All Men, together with all the Influences of the Spirit upon the Hearts of Men, Exciting them to a due Reflection on <hi>the Law of GOD Written in their Hearts:</hi>
               <q>Thou ſhalt Love the Lord thy GOD with All thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and thy Neighbour as thy Self.</q>
The Inward Evidence of the Spirit in this Sence I Aver to be the PRINCIPAL <hi>Rule of Faith and Life:</hi> All External Revelations, Teachings, and Inſtructions, are to be Receiv'd in a way of <hi>Subordination</hi> thereunto. This is the Rule, or Meaſure, which we Ought Chiefly and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to Follow; or be Led by, in all our Inquiries what we Ought to believe for our <hi>Soul's Health,</hi> for the Improvement of our <hi>Sanctification</hi>: The Cauſe that any Man <hi>Refuſes</hi> to yield his <hi>Aſſent</hi> to any <hi>Sanctifying Truth,</hi> is, that he Acteth Contrary to this Rule. <hi>G. K.</hi> diſcovers his groſs Ignorance of the Truth I here Aſſert, in that he affirms in his <hi>Narrative,</hi> that the
<q>
                  <hi>Jews and the Pagan Philoſophers,</hi> who Blaſphem'd againſt the Man <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> did own, and confeſs to the Light Within:</q>
To which in my Publiſh'd <hi>Reflections</hi> on that <hi>Narrative,</hi> I gave this Anſwer:
<q>The <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Pagans wou'd</hi> moſt certainly have Believ'd the Goſpel Preach'd unto them, if they had <hi>Own'd the Light within,</hi> that is to ſay, if they had been Ready to yield their <hi>Aſſent</hi> to any Doctrine Preached unto them, to which they could have <hi>no Reaſon</hi> to Deny their <hi>Aſſent.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words of <hi>W. Penn,</hi> which <hi>G. Keith</hi> Recites, p. 9, &amp; 12. I highly Approve.
<q>By General Rule, we underſtand that conſtant Meaſure, by which Men in all Ages have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to judge of the Truth and Error of Doctrines, and the Good, or Evil, of Thoughts, Words, or Actions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>By Faith, we underſtand an Aſſent of the Mind, in ſuch manner to the Diſcoveries made of God thereto, as to reſign up to God, and have dependence upon him, as the great Creator, and Saviour of his People.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But ſays <hi>G. K.</hi> p. 10.
<q>This General Rule did not extend, nor doth, to be the Rule, or a Rule of the Faith of Remiſſion of Sin, by the Blood of the promiſed Seed of the Woman,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66454:3"/>
the Lamb of God that was to be Slain, and ſhould take away the Sin of the World.</q>
To this I Anſwer, That whoſoever <hi>Obſerves</hi> this Rule, does <hi>Virtually or Implicitly</hi> Believe all the Truth Delivered in the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> in that he is in a Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Receive it, whenever it ſhall be Propoſed unto him in Terms which he clearly underſtands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 25.
<q>Seeing the Light Within, ſays <hi>G. K.</hi> gives them not this Faith (the Faith of Chriſt the great Sacrifice) nor teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it them, it evidently follows that the Light Within every Man is not the Rule of the Chriſtian Faith.</q>
To this I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That the Light Within every Man gives to every Man, that does not <hi>Rebel</hi> againſt it, the Faith of Chriſt the great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; ſo that when any thing Relating to our Saviour ſhall be duly Propoſed to him, as the Object of his Faith, he will moſt certainly embrace it, or yield a ſincere Aſſent unto it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 48.
<q>Nothing can be a Rule of Chriſtian Faith, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the peculiar Doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion, but that Doctrine, which ſets before our Minds certain Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Truth, to which the Mind can, and ought to Aſſent, from ſufficient Motives of Credibility.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We ought not to <hi>Aſſent</hi> to any Affirmations <hi>Externally</hi> Propoſed, as Objects of the Chriſtian Faith, unleſs we can Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in them a Suitableneſs, or Correſpondence with That which <hi>the Spirit of</hi> TRUTH <hi>has Written in the Hearts</hi> of All Men. The <hi>Quakers</hi> Acknowledge that upon this Account they are <hi>Obliged</hi> to Believe all the Doctrine Contain'd in that <hi>Form of ſound Words,</hi> which we call <hi>The</hi> NICENE CREED. <hi>B. C.</hi> one of <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s <hi>Brethren,</hi> in his Book Entituled, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>clear'd from being Apoſtates,</hi> hath theſe Words, "The <hi>Quakers</hi> Believe "the Subſtance of the <hi>Nicene Creed.</hi> I earneſtly Requeſt all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who Profeſs themſelves to be True Members of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> to obſerve theſe words in the ſame Book, p. 57.
<q>I ſay, He would have as truly repreſented the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> as he hath done the <hi>Quakers:</hi> If he had ſaid of them, that they held Univerſal Grace, and that there was never any ſuch Thing in the World, as the Solemn League and Covenant, and no ſuch Man as the Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Murdered, or that King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt cut off his own Head, or that they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66454:4"/>
never Hanged Men only for being <hi>Quakers,</hi> or that their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in <hi>SCOTLAND</hi> were for Univreſal Liberty, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Barbarity to the EPISCOPAL Clergy, and their Deſign to Excommunicate all Perſons that ſhould Buy, or Sell with, or Entertain a <hi>Quaker,</hi> which had took ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, had not the Clemency of the King Interpoſed, to break their Miſchievous Deſigns.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 59. <hi>G. K.</hi> exclaims againſt <hi>W. Penn</hi> for calling <hi>The Spirit, The Rule of Faith,</hi> The Spirit being the <hi>Principal Efficient of</hi> Faith, and not the <hi>Inſtrumental</hi> Cauſe of it. To this I Anſwer: That 'tis Evident when <hi>W. Penn</hi> calls <hi>The Spirit</hi> the Rule, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands our <hi>Participations</hi> of the Divine Spirit, the Impreſſions of <hi>Truth,</hi> that <hi>The Spirit of</hi> TRUTH has made upon our Hearts. That this is <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Meaning appears moſt evidently, in that he allow'd his Son (who was a Wonderful Ingenious Young Man) to Publiſh a ſhort Treatiſe of mine, Entituled, "<hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae Quorundam</hi> R. Barclaij Noematum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with His own Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, in which are theſe words:
<q>If we by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> underſtand GOD, <hi>viz.</hi> the Third Perſon of the Holy Trinity, I confeſs we ought not to call Him the <hi>Rule</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> in a Strict Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal way of Speaking.</note> 
                  <hi>of Faith, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>; ſince the Rule of Faith is that <hi>Inſtrument</hi> by which we <hi>rightly</hi> Examine what is the Object of the Chriſtian Faith, or what that is, that Chriſt hath laid down for us to Believe: But we may alſo underſtand by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> [I ſhould have Tranſlated it, <hi>The Divine Spirit</hi>] our Partaking (my word is <hi>Participatio</hi>) of the Divine Spirit, with which Every Rational Soul is endu'd by an <hi>Idea</hi> of the moſt Great and moſt Good GOD, Ingrafted in its Nature: In which ſence we by right ought to ſay, The Spirit is the Principal, or Chief Rule of our Faith, to which the Scriptures themſelves are Subordinate. For we only Perceive they carry a Divine Sence, as far as we feel their <hi>Congruity</hi> with the <hi>Idea,</hi> or Impreſſion of the <hi>Divine Being,</hi> which <hi>God himſelf</hi> hath fixed in our Hearts.</q>

            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>R. BARCLAY</hi>'s Proteſtation, of which his Learned Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſpeaks, p. 226. pleaſes me much. That he, with thoſe of his Religion, are willing their Doctrines and Practices ſhould be Try'd by the Holy Scriptures, and to admit as a poſitive, and certain Maxim, that whatſoever any do, pretending to be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66454:4"/>
led by the Spirit, which is contrary to the Holy Scriptures, ſhould be reputed a Deluſion of the Devil.</q>

               <hi>P.</hi> 66.
<q>Excepting the common Principles of Juſtice and Temperance, all other things relating either to Faith, or Life, with reſpect to the peculiar Doctrines, and Precepts of the Chriſtian Religion, are not to be found at all in the Light Within every Man, abſtractly, and by it ſelf conſider'd.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It implies the groſſeſt Contradiction, that <hi>The Light Within</hi> ſhould be conſider'd abſtractly from CHRIST, ſince by that <hi>Light</hi> we underſtand <hi>Chriſt himſelf,</hi> and all that Comes "from Him, Tending to the Conviction, and Converſion of "Sinners. <hi>In Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> The Light Within, The True Light that Enlighteneth Every Man, are <hi>Hid All the Treaſures of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Knowledge</hi>: So that whoſoever does not <hi>Rebel</hi> againſt The Light Shining in ſome Meaſure in his own Heart, does <hi>Virtually</hi> Believe all the Truth, the Belief whereof is neceſſary for his SALVATION.</p>

<q>Whether the Spirit of Chriſt (whoſe Judgment and Determination is all one with that of Chriſt, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) doth give his Judgment to the Church, and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, by any other Law, or Rule, Meaſure, or Standard, than what is already to be found in the Holy Scriptures, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther relating to Articles of Faith, or poſitive Precepts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and Inſtituted Religion, by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles in the New Teſtament?</q>
