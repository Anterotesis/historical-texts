            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which commeth in due season to fill our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries

staffe of bread. For Parliaments are our <hi>Panis
quotidianus,</hi> our true bread, all other wayes
are but <hi>Quelques choses,</hi> which yeeld no true

            <p>This very Parliament which hath sate so
long, hath but beat the ayre, and striven against
the streame, <hi>I may truely say, the wind and tide
hath still bin against us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same ill Counsels which first raised the
storme, and almost shipwrack't the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi>
they still continue, they blow strong
like the <hi>East wind,</hi> that brought the <hi>Locusts</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

cast difficulties in our way, hinder our
proceedings, and make all that we doe to bee
fruitlesse &amp; ineffectuall. They make us not to
be Masters of our businesse, &amp; so not Masters
of mony, which hath bin the great busines of
this Parliament, that we might pay the armies
according to our promises and engagement.</p>
            <p>For, my Lords, our not effecting of the good
things, which we had undertaken for the good
of the <hi>Common weale</hi> hath wounded our repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,

            <p>Is it not time then (my Lords) that wee

            <p>My Lords. It is most agreeable to nature,
and I am sure most agreeable to reason, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the present conjuncture of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires:
for one maine engine, by which our
enemies worke our mischiefe is by infusing
an opinion and beliefe into the World, that
we are not united among our selves, but like
<hi>Sampsons</hi> Foxes, we draw severall wayes, and
tend to severall Ends.</p>
            <p>To defeat then the Counsell of these <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophels</hi>
which would involve us, our Religion,
our being, our lawes, our liberties, all that
can be neare and deare unto an honest Soule
in one universall and generall Desolation, To
Defeate I say, the Counsell of such <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophells,</hi>
the Knights, Citizens, and Burges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the house of Commons, knowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be specially entrusted with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the whole, and in their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
perswaded that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dangers are so imminent,
that they will admit of no delay, have thought
fit to declare their united affections by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into an association amongst themselves,
and by making a solemne <hi>Protestation</hi> and
vowe unto their God, that they will una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously
endeavour to oppose and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Counsels, and the Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
which have brought upon us all
these miseries, and the feares of greater.
